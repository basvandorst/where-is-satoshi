Ah, thx for the info.  I enjoy the articles on your website btw.  Don't agree with everything obviously, but I enjoy the strength of your arguments.

The big difference is the nature of the crowd that Bitcoin has attracted compared to traditional technical projects.  Traditional technical projects (like GNU) typically attract very skilled people who aspire to achieve idealistic goals (the hacker/scientist ethic).  Bitcoin has these people, but they are the ones that have been around for years back when bitcoin was worth pennies.  You have to remember that bitcoin was on the front page of Wired, IEEE and other technical publications YEARS ago during the first bubble at 30$ and well before that.  Most technical people seriously interested in privacy/cryptography/p2p money (this is not all technical people)  would have already heard about bitcoin for a long time.
The huge crowds/evangelists that have come since during the $200 &amp; $1000 bubbles have largely been attracted by the legitimate opportunity to get rich quick.  They've read stories of a lot of early adopters making staggering sums almost overnight with no work and naturally want to get in on the action.  These people now make up the majority of the bitcoin community.  There are some who are attracted to BTC for political reasons and others looking for new entrepreneurial opportunities, but the vast majority of lay people are in it to get rich quick without doing any work by simply buying bitcoin and holding onto it with the assumption its going to be more valuable in the future.  
This can be undeniably proven by just looking at the constant chatter of the fiat price value.  If your interest in bitcoin as a technology, then price should not matter as fiat plays no role in the protocol design.  Take at the look at the programmers at UnSystem for example, who are interested in bitcoin primarily as a political tool to weaken the power of the state and increase the power of the individual.  They aren't contributing thousands of hours of expensive developer time just to make the Winklevoss twins even richer; they contribute to bitcoin for  the pursuit of non-monetary ideals.
Many of the most influential players in the bitcoin community are not programmers, but hedge fund managers, wealthy entrepreneurs, and angel investors looking at bitcoin as a new opportunity to increase their own ~~(fiat)~~ wealth.  Skilled technical people, who generally already have well paying jobs and secure financial positions, often do not feel the need to devote their time towards such pursuits.  Its only reinforced when you meet some kid who just bought 1000$ worth of bitcoin and; despite having a fairly poor understanding of the technical aspects of bitcoin, finance, or economics; keeps incessantly evangelizing about how awesome bitcoin is while genuinely believing he will be a millionaire in a few years when "the price goes up".

He cashed out shortly after making that statement during the first bubble at 30$ so he has not ridden the return from the beginning.  He also lost enormous amounts of money day-trading.

This is a really bad idea.  You need some perspective; bitcoin is still extremely geeky.  Even the vast majority of people even who work in tech are unaware of it.  By going to such lengths to give them bitcoins, you are really proselytizing the technology and trying to make the day about yourself rather than them.  Weddings are all about tradition.  No matter how hard you try and explain it, you will be branded as cheap or wierd by others by trying to buck tradition.  Just cash out and give them money like everyone else.

I played Urban Terror years ago and got tired of it after a few days because there wasn't really much skill involved.  It basically came down to who was able to shoot you in the side or back first by camping.  Yea, the one hit kills may be realistic, but it didn't make it fun.
If people start playing for bitcoins I can see it becoming a super campfest since no one would be willing to take any risks.

I know a guy who has made 6 figures mining since he learned about bitcoin super early and managed to mine thousands of those suckers back when the reward difficulty was trivial.  Ironically, he's not even a tech guy but stumbled onto bitcoin completely by chance while surfing one day.  He doesn't want to get a job so he just lives super frugally alone in his apartment slowly withdrawing the bitcoins as he needs them.  If it hadn't been for bitcoins, he says he would have been unemployed since he doesn't have any skills or credentials.
He's a loner but surprisingly isn't into the typical loner activities like computers, programming, music, games, movies etc. so I really don't know what he does all day by himself.  He's a strong advocate though of digital privacy so he hasn't revealed to me that much about his life.
He estimates that at the current valuation, he can live this way for another 10-20 years.  If the price of bitcoin eventually goes up (which he expects it will), this timeline will naturally be extended.

Not a comment, but just an observation.
I think it would be nice if there was a venue for the public to make small contributions without being vetted or a fully committed partner in the project.  Things like fixing up small bugs or doing some documentation or whatever.  Not all of us have 10 years industry experience in CAD design or product management etc.

I wouldn't say either, they are just lazy and want the most clicks with the least effort possible = copy/paste stories.  Since the BTC community clicks and comments on ANYTHING even remotely related to bitcoin, seems like a no brainer option.

Most of the value is speculative, but a lot of the speculation is pretty well founded.

If you have large amounts of BTC, there is a big arbitrage opportunity by exchanging bitcoins for lindens and then to USD.  Over the past month, the rate for bitcoins on virwox has been between 20-60 cents higher per bitcoin than MtGox due to market illiquidity.  This might explain what is happening.

I would bet all my bitcoins against anyone who didn't believe that the bitcoin community was overwhelmingly dominated by white upper-middle class males.  A statistically accurate representative survey may come out one day from academia but it may take a long time given the unique nature of bitcoin.
Still, just from anecdotal information its pretty obvious to see.  If there was a way to verify, I'd definately love to put my bitcoins where my mouth was against anyone who didn't believe this was true.

Lol instead of breaking out the arithmetic to make it look scientific, you could just say that you are completely guessing.  I'm guessing its going to continue bubbling for awhile then crash dramatically later on.  The entire rally is being promulgated by just a few market manipulators with LOTS of bitcoins (as evidenced by all the fake bidwall activity). The growth is not organic at all because the level of goods and services available for exchange has not changed in 2 months nor the size of the bitcoin community doubled with newcomers.  Its really up to those people (maybe 5-10 players?) to determine when they want to cash out and let the market crash.

What do you expect when you are participating in a completely unregulated market without any secured title to what you bought anyway?  All the terms like securities fraud or misuse of customer funds don't even apply to anything bitcoin related because no legal framework exists yet for it.
I or any other programmer could have hacked up this site in a few weeks given that 90% of the site's functionality (voting, reputation, q/a, css etc.) was already made in the open source OSQA engine.  That alone should have made the valuation close to nothing since there is nothing proprietary there.  Even a 14,000$ valuation is ridiculous.  They only make revenue by taking a 5% cut of bounties, most of which average around 10 cents and BitcoinAdvertisements, which probably pay close to nothing since bitcoin users use adblock.  It doesn't matter what it cost them to make; there is no revenue, low barrier to entry, and they are competing against free (forums/google).  
The only value this would have in my book would be as an impressive showpiece for my resume.

Cash money is practically intangible too considering that 90%+ of it is just a numbered key in an Oracle database in a bank or government institution somewhere.  The amount of paper and coins in use represents just a tiny fraction of the overall wealth available, especially in rich credit-card friendly countries.   Sweden is getting pretty close to a cashless society, currently only 3% of their economy is conducted in paper and coins; in some towns it's already 0%.

Most people who support bitcoin at the moment are young, white, middle or upper-middle class males in college or with a college level education.  Among this group, life opportunity IS relatively equal; the main things differentiating success are primarily ambition and persistence.  Its why the libertarian survival of the fittest mentality is so appealing, especially when you feel that your over-burdensome taxes are going to subsidize welfare for lazy black people or Mexican illegals.
@_date: 2012-05-28 18:55:02
Do not assume that the people on the other end know what they are doing.  Most developers do not have a background in secure coding since it is not taught in school and is not a priority for the majority of applications.  In the commercial field, the most important aspect generally is being able to ship on time and on budget.  Its only if you work with a few sectors like military/banking/medical applications that secure coding really gets pounded into your head.  Most of these sites popping up only have 1 programmer doing 90% of the work who probably does not have to focus on secure coding practices in his day job.  Customers also care more about functionality than security.  This is why Zhou Tong's exchange was so successful, there simply wasn't one available before.  
The most secure way to safeguard your BTC is to have 2 wallets.  One wallet (possibly online) to do regular commerce, and another offline savings wallet in an air-gapped machine.

You can't distribute a printed book without a printing press and even in a nuclear war, we will still have lots of high tech equipment requiring electricity.

The official client has some sort of encryption in the wallet, but I haven't really looked into the details to see how its implemented.  One would assume they use the SHA-2 algorithm since they've had experience using it for the core BTC protocol.  All they really protect is your private keys.  It doesn't really matter if your client is running or not since your coins are stored in the BTC p2p cloud (regardless of what kind of wallet you use) rather than segregated on your comp as most newbie videos would lead you to believe.  Its just that nobody can access those coins without the private keys to go with them; this is all that hackers are looking for.  Your client can be off; it doesn't stop someone from accessing your hdd through some malware and dloading/cracking your wallet.dat file.
If you have a ton of BTC, there are ultra secure ways of storage, like printing out your private keys then putting the paper in a safe and deleting the client.  Generally speaking though, an air-gapped machine should be good enough.  I use the official client since its the most trustworthy but there are other supposedly more secure clients out there like armory.  The problem is that none of these guys are vetted and you basically just have to trust them unless you want to review the code yourself.  Not an unreasonable request given the huge amount of scams out there like mybitcoin.
 &lt; If you know nothing about encryption, a video like this will show you how BTC is able to function hacker-free.

I know the whole "sell pickaxes during a gold rush" argument but the reason why I'm not convinced is because you don't actually do any "real work" mining.  Granted I've never mined so I don't know exactly whats involved, but I'm guessing once you've set things up you just press a button and walk away.  If the asic design were as revolutionary as is being described, seems to me like it would make a lot more sense to never announce its creation at all, keep everything secret and mine all the bitcoins for yourself in private.

It is unfair but the rules are written like that because people are incredibly naive and stupid with their money (just look at the latest pirate40 example) and the government ends up paying the tab if you fuck up.  They are designed to keep you from harming yourself.

Bad news.  All transactions are transparent, meaning anyone can see exactly what you have.  You can do some obfuscation, but in theory you can never be completely anonymous.
Also there is nowhere you can invest your bitcoins and expect a return currently because bitcoins are lawless.  There was a bitcoin stock exchange, but that got shut down due to infighting among the owners.  None of the ripped off shareholders could do anything because there are no bitcoin laws and no bitcoin courts.  All you can do is lend to people based on reputation and hope they will pay you back interest + principle.

Yes its possible to do this; its called arbitrage.  More people don't do this because it requires a large amount of bitcoin volume to offset the cost of the fees as well as the risks involved with tying up funds in the exchanges.  The price of BTC itself is also quite volatile so if you can't trade fast enough you may lose all your profit.  You can do arbitrage trading manually or write an algorithm for a trading bot to do it for you.

Who's to say it has fallen through?  Many investigative journalism reports take years to properly compile (like Watergate).  As far as I know, WL did receive a hard drive from a BOA VP but found the information very difficult to navigate and no immediate smoking gun.  [They also received 2 discs from Rudolph Elmer]( a Julias Baer manager in the Carribean who wanted to expose tax evasion by the rich but they haven't done anything with it as far as I know.  Maybe financial journalism is harder due to all the numbered accounts, lack of bank cooperation/secrecy etc. ?  I don't know just speculating.

Cool concept.  Lotta hype.  A couple issues I see so far.
1. Most individuals or businesses do not do enough commerce with each other to warrant large credit limits.  If there is any kind of enduring commerce relationship, it usually consists of regularly buying one specific thing from an individual who specializes in some widget and then exchanging in return your own widget or just using cash.  Then we go to another individual/business to get another specialized thing etc.  If I have been buying pizzas from Bob for ~$10 for years, what happens when I want to buy a diamond ring worth ~$1000?  Maybe the protocol allows you to split up payment somehow between your relations, I dunno.
1. Says the project is open, but when you click the developer link it asks you for a login.  I don't see the actual source.
1. I don't think guys like the CEO of Prosper would be taking this kind of thing on unless they could see a way to profit somehow since the idea of Ripple makes his whole business model obsolete.  Unless they are looking to profit via Ripple coins, I don't see how you can set up an anonymous decentralized payment system and still expect to charge fees to make a cash money profit.
1. Unless businesses start accepting lots of stranger friends right from the get go, its hard for me to see how they can make money fast.  Of course, if you start doing that, its no better than existing payment systems.  Lets say I start company ABC that makes custom DJ turntables.  I don't know anybody and nobody knows me.  It is gonna take a long time to find enough trustworthy people that you will feel comfortable issueing IOUs to before you can start moving any serious product.

1. The Silicon Valley investors is just YCombinator.  Their strategy is to spam a shitload of startups with ~$5-15k and hope one out of twenty eventually become profitable.  We're not talking big money here.
1. The only reason they probably bothered giving money to Coinbase is that the developer worked at AirBnB, which turned out to be massively successful for YCombinator.  They are investing primarily in the developer, not Bitcoin.

Fraud IS acceptable in bitcoin.  Thats why you don't get in trouble by bitcoin for running ponzi schemes; a large portion of the bitcoin economy.   Its not like the developers didn't know that it would happen when they wrote the protocol.  It is a natural side effect that forms in the absence of any regulation.  They specifically did not include any repercussions or enforcement mechanisms within the technology in order to free any capital control restrictions.  This is exactly what anarcho-capitalism is all about.  You are all on your own in the wild west.  Whether you become a millionare or get scammed and robbed, its all the result of your own actions entirely.  This is the moral philosophy of bitcoin.
This OP's post isn't about educating users about a scammer.  Its about the OP demanding an apology from someone who the OP believes was violating the OP's morals, not bitcoins'.

The arithmetic and logic used is wrong.
The comparison between the second and third graphics are wrong because the second measures jobs supported per year but the third measures jobs supported per week.  Since wages are an ongoing cost, you need to divide the 3rd giant graph by 52 in order to get a correct comparison.
If the fed were to subsidize minimum wage jobs at the cost of 85 billion a month, or 1020 billion dollars a year, the number of jobs would be:
Minimum wage salary he used from second graph:
100 million / 3500 min wage workers = ~$28571 annual salary
1020 billion / ~$28571 = 35.7 million jobs a year
This is obviously not an increase of a factor of 100 times the number of people seen in the third giant graphic (72.8 million)
Number of people 40 billion can support for one week (3rd graphic)
40 billion / (~$28571/52) = 72.8 million 
The reasons why the numbers are so wrongly inflated is that he forgets the fact that you need to keep paying people the same wage month to month in order to keep them employed.  Unlike a widget, hiring someone is an ongoing cost.

The Romney's filed their tax returns of course, but they are kept in secret and stored at the SEC (as is his right).  They have not though made them public for the American people to see.  The theory from the media is that he probably is hiding some pretty unethical decisions  that saved him enormous amounts of taxes by gaming the tax code; thats why he's resisting.  There is already some evidence of this as seen from the offshore bank accounts he has disclosed and his 100 million dollar IRA.

Rugatu is completely autonomous through scripts and user participation.  Thats the appeal for devs to build sites like this; they just have to put in the initial time and then can leave it and let the money roll in (or so they thought).  As soon as you have to put in dev time to source domain experts, make sure the right questions are going to the right people, customer support if answers are unsatisfactory etc. then it just loses all appeal.  You could try to outsource the work to India or the Phillipines, but even at $1/hour labor costs overhead start to add up and make it not worth your effort (the cost to host a site like Rutagu is ~$100 a year).

There is no overlap between what Stuxnet targets and financial software.  Stuxnet was written to produce false data via Siemens industrial control systems to trigger catastrophic vibrations in the nuclear centrifuges at Iran's nuclear plants.  It was completely custom code that featured a huge amount of assembler.  You cannot "modify" it to attack Goldman Sachs. 
This article was about Zeus and Zeus does not attack banks.  Bitcoin itself doesn't protect from this kind of attack, only an offline wallet.  These thefts are not due to a failure of the banking system, but rather Windows OS security.

It really depends how confident you are about bitcoin's pricing.  Dollar cost averaging is used if you aren't sure about how prices will move in the future.  The problem with it is that you could spread out your 10,000$ over a week, a month, a year or 10+ years, there is no guideline for what is appropriate.  If you feel confident about what is a good price (i.e. timing the market), then lump sum it.  
MtGox is not secure.  Anything that you are not planning on trading frequently should be kept in an offline wallet.

Also, the website looks like it was made in 1999.  Very amateur, shady, and unprofessional.  Even if you don't know any html or design, you should take the time to use a cms with a free theme like wordpress or joomla.  It will only take you a few days to learn if you know any coding.  
I also noticed that you don't have any SSL on your registration form.  This matters since you are dealing with money.

I think its dumb unless its money you can afford to lose.  
Like it or not, the world runs on cash and will continue to do so for the rest of your lifetime.  At the bare minimum, you should have fully stocked your emergency fund and taken full advantage of any tax-sheltered investment accounts that your company or government offers you first.  Similar to gold, the value of Bitcoin is primarily speculative; you just cannot predict the future with these things (which is why there is such huge volitility).  As with any speculative investment, you should be able to sleep at night if you lost it all.  A very plausible scenario is if a major bank/government/company created their own digital currency and backed it with the power and gravitas of their brand.  Grandpa Moneybags is much more likely to buy HSBC-branded digital coins than some obscure geeky Bitcoin that keeps getting hacked.  Or maybe somebody exploits a core flaw in the source code and steals/mines 30% of all coins in circulation.
This is the nature of high risk and high reward.  Contrast it with stocks, bonds, or real estate, where contrary to popular opinion, there are intrinsic fundamental reasons why these investments will produce returns.  
TL;DR - Gamble with as much as will allow you to sleep at night if you lost it all.

One of the biggest problems with Bitmit I've found is that it, similar to ebay, is littered with too much useless crap at too high a beginning asking price that no one wants.  I guess since the listing fees are so cheap, sellers can list their spam ebooks (get rich quick etc.) 100x for 15BTC and it only takes one sucker to make it profitable to do it all again.  Not sure what you guys can do about it, but it really degrades the quality of the buyer's experience.

I am an active contributor to Electrum and would caution people the v1.0 release was largely symbolic due to the original author ThomasV ceasing work on the client and giving up the reigns to over to genjix.  The v1.0 label should not be interpreted as a signal of stability in my opinion; the code isn't exactly mature (although I can't say I've studied the quality of code in any of the other clients either).  
I would not bet the farm of my bitcoins using this client yet, but its useful to experiment with the innovative features and make quick painless transactions.  The project is under active development and I can imagine new stable releases coming out soon after with new features etc.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if the figure is 200,000.  The type of people that buy these things are cash rich but time poor.  Professionals or any level white collar workers primarily from the US and Europe.  
A typical scenario would be something like: lets say you play WoW but one of your guildmates that you're good friends with has been raving about how awesome League of Legends is.  You want to go questing with him because WoW is getting boring but he's a level 42 and you'd be a level 0.  Because of your job and your wife/kids you can only afford to put in any serious time gaming on Friday or Saturday nights, maybe 6 or 7 hours a week max.  It makes way more sense to pay someone in China $50USD to train a customized character up to lvl 42 with all the spells and specific gear that you want so that you can begin questing with your friend immediately rather than spending 48 hours grinding out your character.

Those figures do not come from playing actual games, its all to do with gold/item farming or character leveling.  They aren't having fun, its all about trading their time for your money.  Whatever the true figures are, China's competitive gaming scene is far smaller than its neighbors in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore and there aren't 200,000 people in those countries earning 50k.  They just aren't rich enough to foster that kind of industry yet. 
Gold farming operations are typically run in groups of 6-12 in a single room where mostly young men from the countryside with no skills are recruited to just grind out gold/items all day.  They play in their underwear due to the outdoor heat (aircon is $$$) and the fact that they've got like a dozen computers/servers crammed into these tiny apartments.  As soon as the day shift is done, those guys go to sleep in bunks and the night guys wake up and take over the accounts.  Pretty much all the money goes to the guy that runs the operation/recruited them.  Pooled together, it probably totals somewhere around the $50,000USD mark that was quoted.

Bitcoin is still in the teething phases.  Thankfully, most of the really difficult technical parts have already been completed by really intelligent people.  The rest of the stuff (like useability) will come quickly as people begin to realize the potential wealth that can be generated.  Think Usenet of old vs the Internet we have today. 
1.  Its just a counterfeit-proof un-duplicatable message that lets other computers know that you (or the person you recieved the message from) solved a really difficult math problem.  Also, now that you solved it, no one else can.  They do this to replicate what makes gold valuable, that its finite non duplicateable.
2.  You only need the private key.  This is because its unique and private to you and you only.  Your public key has already been broadcast over the bitcoin network.  Even if you don't have your public key, the computer can figure out what it is based on the private key. This [diagram displays how the keys work]( to send those messages in answer 
3.  The client knows because the information is completely public through the blockchain that you downloaded.  You know how many bitcoins everyone else has, and they know how much you have, its just that you can't access them because you don't have the secret code private key.  If you don't believe that, [go to this block explorer link]( and tack on any bitcoin address to the end of the url.  You can see exactly how many bitcoins anyone or any organization like Wikileaks recieved.  The reason for this total transparency is to eliminate the need for a central server to record this information.  
4.  When you transfer bitcoins, nothing actually gets "transferred".  All the bitcoins in the entire system are already on your computer from when you downloaded the blockchain.  Its just that you can't get at them because you don't have the correct password code (the private key).  When you transfer btc to someone else all that you are doing is transferring ownership of those math problems to someone else using those counterfeit-proof un-duplicatable messages. You lose access to them while someone else gains ownership.  You can kind of think of it like a giant excel spreadsheet with ownership of each cell (a bitcoin) constantly being transferred to different people.

Given that the bitcoin economy is only worth ~$150 million (I think atm, not sure), it would not be easy to suddenly move in $40 million worth of BTC.  I think the major exchanges in general handle about ~10$ million worth of trade a day (each).  You would definately need to contact them by email if you wanted to do that large amount of transfer.  They'd probably need to vet you a bit extra for money laundering purposes but in the end if you guys check out, all exchanges will probably go out of their way to get a piece of those commission fees.

This video links all the world's major problems to banks due to the fact that all modern economies are debt fueled money.  By that logic, life should have been awesome before we had it.  The whole inflation argument is misleading because nobody holds their wealth in pure cash.  The majority of people's wealth is in either stocks, property or pensions/annuities.  You can create debt out of thin air, but you can also create wealth out of thin air.  As long as you are creating more wealth than debt, your economy is fine.  There is nothing wrong with credit (an IOU); it has value based on trust.

OK for starters he states that economics comes from western european civil law, that it is a strictly white man's invention, and that it is the central component to making a person "white" rather than any other race.  By this logic, culturally "white" people didn't exist before modern capitalism as described in European civil law.
He places the downfall of native american tribes on the fact that they were too "confused" to really understand ownership and thus got owned due to their backwardsness.  The reason why most native tribes did not have free-hold land ownership treaties was because they were hunter-gatherer societies.  Free-hold land ownership only makes sense if you stay in one place year round (i.e. you farm/agriculture).  He also fails to mention that when native tribes did enter formal land ownership contracts with the British or USA, governments routinely just straight up broke them and reseized the land after a few years and said "fuck you" to the legal process.
He then makes the same argument for Africans, Arabs etc. basically everyone else, implying that they were inferior because they didn't latch on to modern economics as fast as white people did.  He conveniently forgets to mention basic things like smallpox, tuberculosis, typhoid, bubonic plague which wiped out an estimated 90% of the indigenous populations in South and North America.  Or guns.
He states that the crusades were more due the Arabs' backward sense of economics than religion...  I guess all those crosses and crescents didn't mean jack shit for the people sailing away for decades to a foreign land with slim chance of coming back alive.

You give them cash like everyone else because its tradition and you don't want to make waves on their special day.  If you want to tell them about BTC and its potential **after** their honeymoon, you can definitely do that.  Its their decision though whether or not they want to sink their money into it, not yours.  Remember you are not giving just to the guy, but to the girl as well.  She may not approve of BTC and its speculative potential as much as your guy friend would.

By far the thing people in America respect most is money.  The most effective way to draw people into bitcoin is to give up the activism, get off your ass, and start a business.  Start earning serious money using bitcoin and people will start respecting your opinions and start asking you about bitcoin rather than the other way around.

GL with the project.
Just would like to give the feedback (if helpful) that as a longtime gamer, the reason why I don't buy indie bundles in general is that they just aren't worth it.  There is zero incentive for me to buy these when I can purchase GTAIV or Assassin's Creed etc. for $5.  I know it sounds super harsh and as a fellow dev, I sympathize with the hundreds of hours each programmer puts into his project but if I have to choose between getting a pretty side-scroller or Rome Total War, I'm going with Total War everytime.
You guys have done everything right in terms of pay what you want, variety of payment methods etc.  but I'm not sure its enough.  I feel bad in saying this because I'm not even sure what the correct business model should be, but PC game pricing is so fierce, pay what you want pricing can't be the answer because it is still based on charging for artificial scarcity.  Granted, I haven't played any of the games and judging by the trailer, it seems like all the games are innovative but essentially imo you are still competing against the convenience of doing another fun free activity like watching youtube or browsing facebook.  
Even if I pay nothing for the bundle, I still "pay" 5-15 minutes buying and setting up games franchises which I'm unfamiliar with vs watching some amusing lolcats on youtube or playing 15 minutes of guaranteed fun w/Battlefield3 or whatever.  IMO you have to be making the game as free and convenient as possible and then trying to monetize community interactions later somehow once you have built up one (since a community cannot be copied).  Again I feel bad essentially saying that the works are largely worthless and that I don't know of a better alternative but just expressing my thoughts as a consumer.  I've only read one book that covered this subject, "Free" by Chris Anderson.  Wish I knew more about new age business models that could be more constructive.

Then the problem as you've identified is not exposure, but rather the difficulty in obtaining them.  Advertising would not help this.  You need to walk your users EXACTLY through what is the easiest way for them to get some bitcoins maybe through screenshots or a movie.  You have to highlight why going through this hassle is better than using paypal at some other fur site (eg. potential anonymity).

Geeks (pretty much everyone who uses Bitcoin) generally live in an incredibly insular world because they assume everyone lives online like they do.  Just take a look at gaming for a parallel example.  Titles like Gears of War or Battlefield have for decades dominated the gaming (geek) press yet are obscure to the overall population.  The biggest selling games of all time (The Sims, Football Manager, Wii Sports, Angrybirds etc.) barely get a mention in any gaming publication.  
Just like the internet itself, it takes time for the real world to catch up with technology, and the richer people are, generally the older/analog they are too.  Scientists are aware of developments decades before they happen, engineers can see things years in advance, early adopters (what you are) jump on the bandwagon right before it really starts going.

These kind of posts are so dumb because the market allows you to directly measure how much you believe in bitcoin's sucess; you don't have to go off evangelizing.  If you feel bitcoin is a sure thing, just dump your life savings into it.  If you don't have money, just borrow or leverage yourself to put yourself in a position where you do have tons of bitcoins.  
5$ or $50,000 worth of bitcoin, the market can directly measure how much you believe in bitcoin's success by how much you are willing to put into it.  Evangelism is hypocritical and self defeating it if your money/bitcoins aren't where your mouth is.

This article has nothing to do with Bitcoin
@_date: 2012-12-23 02:08:39
This argument only works if you want to buy bitcoins solely for the purpose of speculation.  If you want to do actual commerce, it doesn't matter what the price of bitcoin is, you can buy at anytime.  You want a $350 gfx card?  You buy $350 worth of bitcoin, send the merchant it and get your card - finito transaction -.
Unlike bitcoin, stocks do have an intrinsic value foundation when you buy them.  When you buy shares, the company is legally obligated to allocate to you a portion of the dividends every year.  Many companies (through shareholder voting) opt not to pay you directly and instead hold onto that dividend.  This inherently makes your share of the company more valuable.  Bitcoin/Gold/Silver etc. 's value on the other-hand is almost purely speculatory.  You can argue its a hedge against inflation but there is no intrinsic value there; without other people to buy it from you its worth nothing.   People buy gold primarily because they are guessing other people will pay even more for gold in the future (aka greater fool theory).  The argument that its driven by demand for jewellery or industrial processes is totally untrue.  In 1970s gold was $50 an ounce; we didn't increase our demand for gold jewelery 35x in 40 years.
So yea, if you wanted to buy bitcoins as a speculative investment, you might have lost out on being one of the first in, but who cares?  Nobody knows what the future holds, thats why there is price fluctuation to begin with.  It is not "inevitable" that BTC will rise.  If you feel bitcoin has nowhere to go but up, then its a pretty no brainer risk free investment even now!  Despite the price, we are still heavily in the early adopter stage too.  Most tech people haven't even heard of bitcoin.  Even now, only about 10% of GDP in advanced countries like the USA is even done through online sites like Amazon.  It will take a loong time before technologies like Bitcoin are mainstream and fully mature.

The only questions worth asking on a site like this are ones that can't be solved with a google search.  These are, by definition, complex and domain specific, knowledge which rugatu's user base typically do not have.
If I'm asking for instructions on how to refit the catalytic converter of a 1965 Mercedes Benz S Class (limited Japanese edition), I want the answer within a few hours, a day or two tops so that I can utilize that knowledge and get on with my life.  It makes a lot more sense to post on a vintage automobile forum than it does on Rugatu.
People also just aren't willing to spend the bitcoins (comparable to real world rates) for what they want.  The top bounty is asking for a router firmware solution that would allow fully automated anonymous time-based wifi rental through bitcoin - something that hasn't yet been invented - .  For this, they are willing to pay ~$50, less than the cost of working one full shift working at McDonalds. 
Also, the devs alienated some users early on with their dickish mod behavior.  I'm fairly sure all the investors lost practically all their money from the IPO sale due to the stock crashing and GLBLE getting shut down.  When Rugatu first went public, the devs set the IPO price valuing Rugatu at a ridiculous $120,000.

Their site is neat but massively overhyped.  Anyone who bought their IPO at a market cap of $140,000 was incredibly stupid.  Probably the worst valuation I had ever seen in my entire life.  The majority of the bounties for questions are about 20mBTC which is about 10 cents, of which rugatu takes 5%.  The devs are also pretty active in policing the content of the questions and answers.  DerisiveMetaphor definately was a target of punitive action after he dissed the site's value to investors.  
I also had a bounty (.25btc) go to a user who provided an unsatisfactory answer because it was the only one standing after the time limit had expired.  I would have paid if I had gotten a correct answer but the fact that my money went to someone who didn't know annoyed me.

He's explaining how, if you plan on making purchases of a company in the future, you should be wanting lower prices rather higher but people are too ignorant to understand since they only see the value of their existing shares going up.
Applied to bitcoin it means this.  Most bitcoiners own some bitcoin, and would like to own more in the future.  This should mean that they *should* hope for lower prices.  However, most want higher prices because it increases the value of their existing holdings.

Unless a way is found to enforce contracts without using the legal system, an advanced bitcoin economy (such as one with a stock market) simply will not happen without the consent and participation of the government.  Right now all that bitcoin has is reputation (aka Silk Road).  This isn't enough to facilitate major commercial activity and is one of the prime reasons why first world economies (rule of law) dominate over third world economies (informal relations).  People may be honest players in good times, but when things go bad, everyone will always choose themselves over you if they have the opportunity.

I did watch it, and in it he is refering to markets that already exist.  Examples could be TorBroker or Havelock investments.  Other than transacting in bitcoin, these operations seem worse than traditional markets because they do not protect you in case things go wrong either legally or cryptographically.  If you're referring to a colored coin model of ownership, there is still nothing binding an organization to follow the will of colored coin holders (unlike normal shares which carry legal protections).  You can issue all the colored coins you want and then just ignore the will of those owners when its convenient.

Very few people are buying bitcoins to do any significant amount of actual commerce.  Bitmit/Bitmarket are largely ghost towns; the most significant trades on the bitcointalk forums are people selling bitcoin for gold/silver (another speculative commodity).  Used steam games, used computer parts, or vpn subscriptions are not responsible for Bitcoin's GDP numbers.  Practically everyone is buying them as a speculative investment.
The only significant goods that can be obtained with bitcoin easier than fiat money currently are Silk Road products and gambling.  These are real value creators, but they are only responsible for a portion of Bitcoin's economic value.  Not as much as the speculative frenzy imo.
The main reason I think I might be wrong is perhaps we haven't even gotten close to the collective "beer/play money" threshold of the interested population.  This is money that buys Bitcoin but doesn't sell when the price fluctuates because the buyer doesn't care since he's got so little of his individual wealth tied up.

Market maker is basically just someone with tons of money who can afford to automatically buy up all the bid/ask offers until the spread is small enough to be within the exchange's wishes.  Since they have tons of money in reserve, they can take the temporary loss of buying and selling BTC at a huge spread; they now hold a "monopoly" over this new smaller spread, and can make back their losses and make a profit over this smaller spread by profiting on all the market orders.  Its good for the consumer because it you're not forced to place a limit order to get a relatively fair price.  You can just pick "market order", take a tiny loss and get your BTC instantly.

Whatever they lack in technical knowledge, VCs are expert negotiators.  If you don't have significant revenue or profits already, then you really don't have much leverage.  They only real benefit you have right now is that Bitcoin is redhot right now and the VCs may be looking to throw away money gambling on ventures like Yahoo did with Summly.

It looks like the developer would be bringing far more to the table than you would based on your vague written pitch and credentials.  If I wanted to code up a bitmit competitor or some other generic ecommerce site, don't really see why I'd need to pair up with you if you aren't bringing any money or contacts to the table that I couldn't get myself.  
You state you brought in 4 million dollars revenue, but how much of that was personal profit?  Seems to me like not much if you want to get involved in a new bitcoin business.  Why keep the name of the company or your own name secret?    
You state that you're pairing up with a "major online wallet company" to handle payment integration.  Well there's only a few: coinbase, bitpay, mtgox, bitinstant etc.
To gain traction, you need to be more specific about your creds or demonstrate what you bring to the table that a developer could not get or do by themselves.

This statement is misleading because it implies that Republicans more fiscally responsible since they want to "hold the line" on the debt ceiling.  As the video clearly explains, **the debt ceiling is raised to pay for programs which have already been bought in the past, not new spending**.  Failing to raise the ceiling is equivalent to buying something and then refusing to pay for it because you thought it was a waste of money.  A true fiscal conservative would have voted against these programs when they were proposed, rather than voting yes and then refusing to pay.  Even if you voted no and got outvoted, you'd still pay as a fiscal conservative to avoid destroying your credit rating.

Its not Yahoo.  Yahoo doesn't have reporters.  They buy articles from freelancers either through a small payment or ad click commission.  In this case you can clearly see its from BGR News.

Wow thx!  Don't feel like I deserved anything.  It may find its way eventually into the hands of the programmers doing the real heavy lifting on the bitcoin project.

You can't stop the problem of the thief simply giving away bitcoins or bitcents to thousands of addresses in order to massively spread the contamination problem.  This was done after the Bitcoinica attack.

You use the same metrics as you would any commodity: speculation in the short term and scarcity/value in the long term.
You are asking to predict the future which is impossible, otherwise the value of bitcoin would not constantly be fluctuating.  The best you can do is guess; markets provide the perfect mechanism for you to profit based on the strength of your guess.

Very cool.  Any plans to open source it?

I don't understand how bitcoin removes the need for a stock market.  The btc stock markets I've seen so far are little more than dividend IOUs being traded around with no legal or cryptographic protections to insure against malice.  I could just as easily make my own website and issue bitcoin "stocks" of companies to people who are willing to pay for them.  There is nothing to stop me from running away with all the funds.

Damn, wish I had 5500.... 
The spike to 240 must have been one hell of a rush for you.

Seems like he's put on a fair bit of weight.  Must be all the stress from working on those miners.

If you sell locally, you put yourself at a big risk of getting counterfeit or dirty money.

How much did you make?
@_date: 2013-02-01 23:21:00
How much did you lose in GLBSE?  Just curious.
@_date: 2013-01-17 05:39:14
Since you are using a throwaway, how may bitcoins are we talking here?  Were you an early miner?  Just curious about the numbers.

Its kind of unknown territory at this point due to the new technology.  The problems of possibly being put on a watchlist or asked a bunch of questions or whatever by police is not worth the risk to trade in large volumes.  Professional exchanges understand the risk and have more resources to take it on (lawyers, insurance etc), but not the individual.
The bank or ATM solution someone mentioned earlier is a good guarentee of security that I hadn't thought about before.  That would neutralize these potential problems.

Its unlikely we will ever live in a post-work society because our standards of living keep rising as our technology advances.  At a bare minimum, practically everyone, regardless of position in society, wants to live as long as they can.  The resources required to lengthen the lifespan are colossal yet its something all societies are willing to spend their resources on.

Damn nice!  Jealous.  Any thoughts/speculation on where the downward price trend is going to mellow out?
Instead of a roadster, consider supporting wikispeed with bitcoin.

Even if its an authentic bill, you cannot check to see if it is dirty money.  You can deposit it into your account and then months later out of the blue the police show up and start asking you all sorts of questions, maybe even confiscate the proceeds.  Its why I charged a 20% markup on any I sold and stopped after awhile deciding that even at that price it wasn't worth it.

The google searches for "bitcoin" from Russia outstrip any other country by a lot (you can take a look on Google trends to see).  Thats all I got though.

No mention of 2 billion anywhere. Downvoted.

All those free bitcoin sites pay less than minimum wage and are a waste of your time.  So is mining for the most part.  The only way to get bitcoins is to sell stuff, provide a service people want, or buy them on an exchange.
The bitcoin ship has already sailed long ago for those looking to get something for doing nothing.

I hope that project pulls through and breaks the oligopoly of the auto companies.  I think the main guy only works on it part time though so there's only so much you can accomplish I imagine.
What projects do you work on?  I wanted to contribute to the qt-client but I honestly didn't understand the whitepaper after I read it.  Over my head.
