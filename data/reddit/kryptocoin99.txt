Best and easiest way to teach  a lesson is to unfollow. A massive unfollow makes them useless.

Bitcoin is preparing HODLers for a completely new economy in the future. One has to go thru a rigor.

Yes. Blocksize need to be increased eventually but order of execution matters especially when you have a massively distributed software run by thousands of people who will update software at their convenience. With that in mind, soft forks, backward compatibility, etc are always utmost important so as to not disrupt global network and risk giving up decentralization. Storage and internet cost is also an important aspect and even though they are cheap we are not quite at a stage where everyone has Gbps internet speed and terabytes of storage. So if you consider all that, SegWit, lightning, bulletproofs, etc are all software level ingenious solutions with little to no compromise on the bitcoin network. The only thing getting in the way right now is greed of a few.

Yes 3 months to plan and prepare for Segwit2x which means majority of Segwit work is already coded and tested. The only thing that changes is blocksize in that code. Look at GitHub. Not much to change if they have already tested segwit2x code.

So they can be fast to implement SegWit2x but just SegWit is too big of a change? They took a downtime just to be prepared for SegWit2x even after it was called off. Wasn't that reckless?

What does that even mean?

Yes, considering I have seen my 401K reduce to half due to screwup of big banks in 2008. And then take a while to recover. Why would I not play offense now?

So you are defending someone for a moment of sanity and ignoring the frauds JP Morgan has committed. He needs to be called out for calling Bitcoin a fraud again and trying to screw a $100 billion market that he doesn't control. Especially because his statements have consequences. Posting some evidence would be nice.

"Honey badger of money doesn't give a sh..". And no one is arguing that but the community needs to be prepared when he opens his mouth against bitcoin again. The probability of that is high. I hope you are not paid by JP Morgan to put out fires before they come close to him.
