I like this criticsm of mining because it gets past the initial 'mining is stupid' argument.  Mining is great, and it's what runs the network.  It hasn't been terribly profitable, but then again, this whole thing is still super new... maybe mining will be profitable with a ROI of 15 years... obviously the volatility/long term increase in value of the currency (from 0-whatever) is going to affect the investment way more now, but who knows what it will do on the long term.  I'm looking forward to see what happens when the network deficit:  becomes a network profit chart ;)

Furthermore, if you're planning on mining, you MUST calculate the cost of electricity...you can use:   
If you think that figuring out these calculations is a pain in the butt...you might want to consider just buying straight into the currency because when the miners start making noise, heat, and stop working...you're going to have to spend way more time/effort than these calculations.  ...if someone is dead set on mining...what other constructive advice could you give them?  
*A hint for the power calculations...after you buy the miner, you have to buy an additional piece of equipment...a power supply, because they never come with it.  The power supply requirements are likely listed in the manual.  From the power supply requirements, you should be able to get the Watts.  From there use the calculator to get the amps.  From there it's algebra Amps = Watts * Volts, solve for watts, and multiply by 24 then by 30 for kwh/month.  pull up your power bill to compare rates.

This is an excellent description of mounting worldwide issues.  
From his website( 
"Before: I am a 40-year-old professional who has worked his way up to Vice President of a large, international Fortune 300 company and is living in a waterfront, 5 bathroom house in Mystic, CT, which is mostly paid off. My three young children are either in or about to enter public school, and my portfolio of investments is being managed by a broker at a large institution. I do not really know any of my neighbors, and many of my local connections are superficial at best.
After: I am a 50-year-old who has willingly terminated his former high-paying, high-status position because it seemed like an unnecessary diversion from the real tasks at hand. My children are now homeschooled, and the big house in Mystic was sold in July of 2003 in preference for a modest homestead in rural western Massachusetts. In 2002, I discovered that my broker was unable to navigate a bear market, and I’ve been managing our investments ever since.  I grow a garden every year; preserve food, know how to brew beer &amp; wine, and raise chickens. I’ve carefully examined each support system (food, energy, security, etc), and for each of them I've figured out either a means of being more self-sufficient or a way to do without. But, most importantly, I now know that the most important descriptor of wealth is not my dollar holdings, but the depth and richness of my community."
Too much of this stuff and you'll be prepper, but this is the best insight into the bitcoin future.

I like the idea of regular hardforks, but I think that regularly scheduling them will induce more risk than necessary.  The risk is in this 'new' fork, and is increased with the SPEED IN WHICH WE UPDATE THE NETWORK.  This new fork will obviously have been tested, but it won't be practical to test this fork at the same scale as the entire network until actual application.  Wouldn't it make sense to update a hard fork as slowly as possible while carefully monitoring the system?  Making these updates regularly scheduled or even automating them could make a small issue a gigantic issue.  Imagine people who aren't actively monitoring their miners have an auto-update, and it takes them a few weeks or months to update the software.  Wouldn't that exacerbate things?

Definitely didn't see that rule, thanks for bringing it up.  
But I still disagree -I think it's outdated.  here's the description of what this subreddit is:"is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem"

In this video Chris Martenson discusses the varying aspects to the coming financial crisis.  He begins with energy.  There's no more cheap oil available, and the economy will soon be severely limited by oil.  He continues with drastic changes that are taking place in the environment and the economy.  Extremely interesting for any bitcoin fanatic.

Written by Brian Pretti and posted on peakprosperity.com, this article gives a great overview of the current international economy.  The article describes how a lot of world players are trying to overcome worldwide deflation with inflation.  
"Quantitative Easing has failed to generate inflation. Stated alternatively: QE has not been able to overcome still extant deflationary pressures."
This worldwide deflation is the deflation of the USD...which can be seen in Russia, Argentina, Venezuela, Japan, etc...
This is relevant to bitcoin because as these countries experience battle a deflating USD, they have been looking for alternatives sparking bitcoin startups.  
My question is, where do these startups go to collaborate?  What kind of collaboration has taken place for bitcoin startups between different languages/countries/continents?  Wouldn't it make sense to have some kind of a regular meeting of the minds?  
I'm sure I wouldn't have been invited if this has already taken place...but I hope it has!

Here's a better Patrick Byrne video (with a description stolen from albacore_futures): 
In this video he criticizes the efficient market hypothesis, claims regulators are blinded by that ideology, and is against financial chicanery such as naked shorts (going short without having actually borrowed the security), among other things. He also makes the argument that terrorists and organized crime are setting up mortgage fraud rings, or attempting to take over existing companies to strip them of assets and funnel money back to their terrorist efforts. In that sense, economic warfare was conducted against the US. Also makes the case that shady figures short-sold during the runup to the 2008 crash, helping fuel the resulting collapse.
Very interesting stuff. Not at all bitcoin related, but interesting.

...you can buy a miner off amazon for $100 (Antminer S1) and plug it up...there's not much to it.  You'll make probably 100 bits a month or something crazy small until it dwindles to 0...but then again, it's only $100.  I think what everyone is TRYING to say here is, "Don't put a bunch of money into mining...and start small"

7badgers - Here's a quote from that linked article: "China is already Russia’s largest trading partner, with turnover of $89 billion last year, according to Russian customs data. Medvedev said that should increase to $100 billion next year before reaching $200 billion in 2020. The yuan-ruble trade on the Moscow Exchange has jumped 10-fold this year to $939 million in September, though still only a fraction of the $374 billion in dollar-for-ruble sales. "

It's taxed as capital gains, so you're taxed on the profit essentially.  9,960,000 (sold at) - 100,000 (bought at) = 9,860,000 (profit).  at the highest tax bracket, you're being taxed 39.6% of your income (profit).  So 9,860,000 * 0.396 = 3,904,560.  The real taxes would be slightly less as the first $400,000 would be taxed at varying rates, but for such a large sum, it's negligible.
