Why not that one?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:07:04
So do you suggest we should use it instead bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:10:40
So is bitcoin. Maybe not to cents, but same trend.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:17:03
I don't know what that is, but if this is really scam then very costly one.

Rebroadcasting resets the 2 week countdown.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:40:16
Possibly never or for very long time.
This tx should have been dropped already but for some reason is being rebroadcast.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:13:33
Ok, thanks. I will.
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:57:35
When moon?
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:54:14
I keep all to diversify. Hodl works good for me.
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:53:08
Why? What is wrong with blockchain? Is it outdated?
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:02:47
That is very good question. I know sites you can earn altcoins for doing tasks, but I don't know any to earn bitcoin.
Can somebody recommend site to earn bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:51:53
 shows I need to pay 200 satoshis/byte. That is a lot. 
Why so much to pay in bitcoin?

Wow, in last 10 blocks only 1 is above 1MB.
Edit: actually it is not as 1MB is 1024kB. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:57:42
Thanks man.
Look on that [transaction](
1!!! sat/byte and in got into the next block.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:24:02
Hmmm, not really. I checked mycelium and is horrible when it comes to fees.
There is only "Low-priority", "Economic", "Normal" and "Priority".
Actually, I checked while I was writing and I see that Mycelium recently added more options to set fees. Good.
Lowest is 6 sat/byte at the moment.
Thanks for you answer. It helped.
Are there any other where I can set 1 sat/byte?

I bought both available to diversify. All was claer and easy, but I can't find bcash there. Have I been scammed? How? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:47:58
I bought bitcoin there. What you are talking about?
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:06:48
So more transactions suggest more interest in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:50:23
Is unconfirmed number rising a good thing?
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:01:09
It is fud I think. Look what is happening. Bitcoin is going up a lot and doesn't care about Tether.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:55:06
I wouldn't recommend anybody to commit significant amount of money to any fork. You never know which one will win.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:42:11
Hardware wallet is a good thing but it has nothing to do with BIP148. If anything, I would recommend using own btc wallet now more than ever because of BIP148. 
AFAIK, don't leave your btc at any outside exchange or wallet near and just  after 1st of August.

More important than Backlog is how much "winners" in the block paid in fees to get there and how much users wants to pay to be in the next block. It is race to the top. Blocks are full and as much I would like to think that reduced backlog bodes well for the future, those paying to actually be in the block are raising fees. Wallets are fine.
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:12:11
I understand I think. Thanks.
I use fork.lol and it shows 4.40 per second. Do you know why such a big difference?
