Very bullish. US to run out money by September. More fiat printing to come

Technical. Not easy to use. There is a learning curve. One has to invest time to learn how to secure wallets, keys, and safely store. And lastly, there is no recourse if lost or compromised keys.

Bullish news

I thought Trump was for less regulation turns out more regulation is coming. Disappointed? Change your vote to body who cares for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:02:14
How much does a machine like that cost? And how many bitcoin does it mine a month?

Agree �� %

No expensive cars. Just accumulation. Bear market showed us a tough lesson
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:16:03
Don’t worry about short term swings.

US sanctions are fundamentally wrong

We understand he won’t say anything contrary to his boss (Trump) views on cryptocurrency. His trying to keep his job
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:13:47
We might not see $12850 again. Remember we in in a bull market. Most day time traders lose trying beat the market. Hodl

Suddenly burns all after outrage on Twitter
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:46:31
Wellsfargo just made the announcement two days ago. Next time they won’t process your transactions. Let us know if you succeed

@_date: 2019-07-24 20:41:48
Great info. Thank you. Do setup require technical know how such as engineer

Good reason

No body knows. If somebody knows they could be very rich. Markets are a phenomenon. What we know is markets come in waves. What triggers the wave is a phenomenon

Bakkt might be postpone yet again
@_date: 2019-11-26 06:58:56
I don’t hold any allegiance to any coin. Just here to make money.  is king

Bitcoin is non confiscatatable��

My max is 21 million BTC
@_date: 2019-08-12 11:26:29
Thanks for pointing that out. Taxes are part of doing business. Uncle Sam gotta have his share
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:29:24
Go to school, study hard, crypto is not for a 15 yr old. Crypto is just next to gambling
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:24:40
Centralized money continue to control what you can buy. Bitcoin is permission-less
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:02:22
Why waste time thinking about the impossible
@_date: 2019-08-04 09:35:10
Yes it was, that’s why we are unable to identify Satoshi Nakamoto
@_date: 2019-08-31 16:57:59
Total scam
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:54:33
Breakout or dump?
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:02:24
Bitcoin is no longer anonymous. KYC ruined everything. Almost all on and off ramps require KYC now
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:20:40
Great resources����
@_date: 2019-08-12 10:22:49
Cause you not paying fees.
@_date: 2019-08-10 05:16:52
Ask US secretary of the treasury, Steven Mnuchin, he seem to know how bitcoin is laundered. 
My understanding is bitcoin is traceable and all on/off ramps require kyc now
@_date: 2019-08-10 14:09:49
Share waste of time and resources
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:04:32
Bull.. I don’t believe you. Proof
@_date: 2019-10-17 04:21:18
You can’t compare apples ��and oranges ��. They are different and require different analysis
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:33:57
Public roads, water infrastructure etc are definitely needed for taxes no one disagrees on that. But majority of the time taxes are used on things that were unintended for such wars
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:58:02
BTC is meant for hodl
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:50:11
No, bitcoin is a store of value. Bitcoin is not scalable and fast enough to meet world daily transactions
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:42:47
Bitcoin continue to be king. Decoupling fails
@_date: 2019-08-12 11:29:10
Yes indeed! 10X easy on and off ramping
@_date: 2019-10-22 12:58:01

You bet! They’re combing the blockchain looking for crimes instead of waiting crime to happen first or have probable cause. They’re pulling the carriage ahead of the horse
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:23:36
Going down will be the same
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:09:07
The market is resilient now. Think of it, major news such as on Bakkt, or Facebook Calibra hardly move markets. 
The market is mature now, any more coins on the market will be easily absorbed. I personally would like to buy the dip
@_date: 2019-08-12 22:04:35
Great question

Bitcoin is not a short term investment or quick spine. So yes if you’re long and no if you are short
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:03:10
None. You snooze you lose. Hodl
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:19:07
Stay the course they will be up’s and downs. You’re on the right track
