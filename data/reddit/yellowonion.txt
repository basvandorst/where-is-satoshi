BU only signals to miners that they can mine bigger blocks, there a limit controllable by the user in the BU node, I don't know where anyone gets the idea it shifts power to the miners, if the majority of node only signal 2MB blocks, then miners aren't going to mine blocks that will get rejected by nodes.

Do you think this mythically dumb "average person" who doesn't understand how to buy a hard drive from best buy, is going to care about running a full node, and not just run a thin client?
The "average person" is not meant to store a full node on their laptop, That's what SPV or other thin wallets are for, your local tech friend runs the full node in a local secure premises and a good internet connection, then you connect your electrum wallet to it, you trust him, so you trust the full node.
If you want to fix other issues, like time-to-sync the entire blockchain, it's not hard to have a blockchain dump checked pointed and signed by several 3rd parties to avoid tampering, then people could ship the blockchain on a drive ready to go.
Your average person isn't going to give two shits about bitcoin if it costs him $2 to transfer money, and 24hrs or more to confirm.

If there's nothing to invest in because no one is legitimately inventing anything worth investing in, then it's just a ponzi scheme, eventually [all the companies with no viable business strategy]( will take down the entire economy.

"if" you know A, but there's no good reason to assume that, and X is a stealth address, every single output address is unique, there's also hidden amounts and with the new sub addresses plain old detective work is also a lot harder.
If you're worried about being traced then churn your wallet.
Blockchain analysis is possible, but there are a lot of "possible" things that are impractical in really, currently you need to own about 70% of monero txs to deanonymize the blockchain.

Never mind you're right, I was thinking about spending, not receiving coin.


if you have 4 mixins, you need to on average to own more than half the inputs to de anonymize the entire blockchain, it's really just a guess based on the idea that every time you make a transaction the probability of a real output increases only when you own a majority of the inputs, it might be lower, say 55% if you have more mixins, without CT/Sealth addresses this number would be a lot lower, which is why I think not mentioning is a mistake, and considering grin uses CT+Stealths and a mixing system, it's probably almost as anonymous as Monero.

Me buying property instead of holding a deflationary currency does not in anyway create growth, buying shares in a mature company, *only* bids up the price of the underlying asset, it does not *create* growth, businesses not bothering to balance their budgets because interest rates are 0, doesn't *create* growth, *plundering savings* only trades future growth for current growth inflating bubbles, what does *create* growth is new technology that increases productivity, and *lowers prices,* do you know what *lower consumer prices* look like? *deflation*.  
Confidence in your future purchasing power creates spending, pessimism decreases it, *perception* of inflation or deflation is the major factor. You could spent 4%/pa of your bitcoin portfolio (or any portfolio really) and NEVER run out of money in a growing market, so you're more likely to to spend that 4%, and the underlying asset (in terms of bitcoin) is deflationary.
