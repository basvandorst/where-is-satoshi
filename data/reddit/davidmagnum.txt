Few in the 90's could have conceive Facebook, Google, Netflix, or Skype but they could see that all the building blocks were there for innovation. Bitcoin is like that today. We might be unable to conceive the future but they will come,  so why raise the barrier to entry this early?

My favorite part,
"Virtual currencies are not regulated by a government" being listed as a risk associated.
But then provides resouces to current FINcen and IRS guidances, laws, and even tax information!

AB 1326 requires a non-refundable $5,000 fee to merely APPLY for a “virtual currency business license” while other states are offering tax breaks for the same new business.
	For example, virtual currency companies in New Jersey with over 10 employees could get favorable treatment , qualifying for up to $5,000 for each new job created under the state's tax credit program. Bitcoin businesses would also be exempt from paying taxes on money they spent on electricity. To quote New Jersey's State Assemblyman Mukherji (D-Hudson), who introduced the measure with Assemblyman Gordon Johnson (D-Bergen),"I want to encourage innovation here in New Jersey. I think there's an opportunity for job creation,"
	It cost a total of $8,500 to apply and acquire this license under AB-1326 in California. If the USA as a whole, followed this example, it would now cost hundreds of thousands MORE to do business in the USA.

I know of a few SJSU film students working on a similar project. They're producing 3 commercials; remittance, merchant, and consumer commercials. I’ll see if they’re willing to share their script and or budget portfolio.
