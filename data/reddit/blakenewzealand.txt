BTC? They seem to dislike big Chinese miners the most
But I don't think it will happen
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:13:12
BCH's current hard limit is 32MB. Nodes/Miners are configured by default to 8MB
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:18:45
Multi terabyte hard drives are pretty cheap these days
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:10:33
The hardware solution is technology improving (the internet's improvements and larger hard drives).. Perhaps a combination of utilising these hardware improvements AND working on layer 2 would have been a good idea (like Segwit2X tried to do)
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:25:30
You can connect a USB hard drive.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:59:47
Equivalent to the cost of a few transactions on the BTC network, or you might already have an external hard drive. Running a full node isn't going to be free if you don't have the hardware already
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:13:50
The current fork can handle up to 32M, But nodes are configured by default to 8MB

He uses Ledger Wallet which calculates BCash fees to be much higher than they actually are. Other BCash wallets like Electron Cash (fork of Electrum) send using 1 or 2 Satoshi per byte fees and get confirmed in the next block

Nah. The underlying technologies are still the same. OSI layer 1 was upgraded (hardware improvements), allowing an increase in Ethernet blocksize (previously had a 10 Megabit per second limit, now gigabit)

@_date: 2018-01-10 01:45:55
Where else?
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:10:23
Guess this one won't last long either then...
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:59:22
Miners moving to BCash

Segwit is the one thing that can help BTC a little bit until lightning is ready. It's currently screwed. Anyway I'm glad everyone doesn't follow Luke
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:49:31
There is a 3rd category
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:00:56
Fair enough.. you could download from GitHub and run offline, but hopefully bitaddress adds it
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:23:28
If you are thinking about selling it's good to have it in an exchange to be able to sell it quickly. For HODLing a wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:23:06
That is well and truely confirmed. Blame your wallet or the service that says it is not confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:13:46
Segwit is supposed to be optional
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:33:58
China also uses Korean exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:24:13
It's no worse than Ethereum and Ethereum classic
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:49:05
Yep.. except when you do fork off and get called an 'Attack on Bitcoin' or a scam
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:47:04
46 sat byte is way too low
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:26:08
And now the tattooist knows it. congrats
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:13:55
Im in New Zealand and have an ANZ account. Haven't used it for crypto though. Sad to see
What specifically in their terms did you break?
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:11:37
Perhaps both are needed. (Long and short term)
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:28:21
I believe that number on Blockchain.info is how many transactions are being made, not ones that are being confirmed per second
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:55:03
Just have a read 
No one owns the name Bitcoin, and people are free to use which ever implementation they like. Which ever one the most people use will be Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:50:38
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:02:03
Yep. But the block size on BCH is currently 8X bigger, so even when it grows they will still be low.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:51:04
Growing block size is how Bitcoin scaled from the Genesis block up until the 1MB limit was reached (a year or so ago). We believe that in almost 2018 technology is adequate to handle this. 8TB hard drives can be had for $150, Internet connections are better these days and most people use SPV wallets anyway.
Lightning seems more like Pseudoscience, it's a complicated tech with the huge fundamental change of handling transactions off the block chain through channels that need to be opened and closed that has been promised for years and the software is only in the pre release phase. Adoption won't happen quickly, just look at Segwit.
Even if the Core Dev team believe Lightning is the way forward, they should have increased the block size a little bit in the short term to avoid the high fee congested madness we saw recently.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:21:44
Ignoring that (I haven't been banned here yet), So you think it is not possible to have a coin be widely used AND scalable? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:31:50
Do you think it will get confirmed with a fee that low?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:57:53
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:00:52
Surely they are obligated to tell you. It's probably anti money laundering BS. Did you have a business that dealt in Bitcoin seeming this is a business account?
