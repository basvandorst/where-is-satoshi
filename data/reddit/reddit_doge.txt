I would use the gold analogy. Gold is a material people can send around the world. It is approximately worth the same around the world (depending on the markets in that specific country). You can exchange gold for local fiat money.
Only difference is that Bitcoin is digital, so 'sending' it does not involve a physical shipment.
(I would also say something about the blockchain and the distributed nature of Bitcoin.)

Ownership can be proven by a blockchain. If my bike gets stolen and I haven't signed any transaction with my private key, the 'unspent transaction' (in this case, the right of ownership) was never transferred, so the bike is legally (still) mine.
(Right now this seams like a leap. but) if every bike were connected to the internet, anyone could constantly check who the bike belongs to. If I were to flag my bike as stolen, people who opted to be informed, would be informed of a stolen valuable being at a nearby location.
Meaning I might get my bike back within a week.
This is probably not the best example of blockchain tech, but I live in a country with an unreasonably large Moroccan population, so I already had 5 bikes stolen and would like to prevent exactly that...

Raspberry Pi $35 = tiny, runs linux, possibly too slow in the future, SD card support up to 64Gb, chain could be stores on USB storage (OS can't, needs to be on SD)
Banana Pi $55 = tiny, runs linux, sufficient for now, SATA HDD/SDD connectivity
PcDuino $45 (including worldwide shipping) = small, runs linux, reasonable computing power, SATA HDD/SDD connectivity
Beaglebone $100 = tiny, runs linux, sufficient computational power for foreseeable future
HummingBoard $50 - $100 = tiny, enough connectivity and quite some power for the small package, availability though? (for outside of USA... ?)
Intel NUC $135 (need memory and HDD / SDD) = small, way more computing power than Rpi, runs Windows or Linux
Gigabyte BRIX $ 125 (need memory and HDD / SDD) = small, way more computing power than Rpi, runs Windows or Linux
(Small disclaimer: I run a full node on a Windows PC. I have solar panels, so I don't care about energy use. The PC I bought (second hand quad core AMD) cost me 100 euros (120 USD), so that didn't hurt at all. It is online 99.9% of the time. I do use Rpi a lot, but personally don't want to make it run as a node, the rpi isn't particularly fast running Raspbian and my patience isn't that big... Also I'm a lazy software developer, hence the Windows.)

Being 1 out of 2 million is still way better than 1 in 7 million (Dutch lottery for example, we have a very small country (17 million people)).
Also, the Dutch national lottery is once a month. Bitcoin is once every 10/15 minutes.
(My not so awesome math: Total hashrate right now is 294,340,000 GH/s, so owning a 160 GH/s machine gives you 1 in 1,800,000 ? Please correct me if I'm wrong. I know this is not how probability works, but we get an idea.)

What most developer don't get, is that they'll probably sell more copies of a game (/software) if they would also offer an option to pay with Bitcoins. What most people seem eager to forget is that only the States love credit cards and 99% of businesses support credit cards, but offer no to little other payment support, since they assume all customers use credit cards.
(When me and my friends travel to the states, we only buy our groceries (and electronics) where we can also pay with our debit cards, since credit cards are too expensive, or as i like to say, unnecessarily expensive.)
What I'm saying is, you won't lose any sales over this devilish technology, no one will stay away because you accept Bitcoins. But you will sell more copies because now people outside of the States can also buy your game, since the rest of the world doesn't do credit cards (and a lot of people stay away from cashcow Paypal.)

Bitcoin is like the Kalashnikov of money.
Anyone older than five can pretty much use it.
Only 13 million are made. (Not true for kalashnikovs, but to please the grammar nazi's, let us be specific.)
You just point and click and the system will take care of the technical stuff for you.
In times of peace people will look at you with a stupid face, asking you why you would need them.
In times of war everyone will need and want them and no one will sell theirs.
It can start a revolution.
The more you have, the better.
It can be stolen and used by others. So you'd better keep an eye on yours.
If you are carying it while being pulled over by cops, it might be confiscated. (Because the local donut shop also accepts Bitcoins.)
They're very popular in Russia.

SD cards are 'flash' memory. The inside of the card itself actually flashes away a tiny bit of material. This way the 'state' of the material changes and it can physically store 1's and 0's, even after power is lost.
The layer of material that is flashed away actually will run out some day. The more writes the card does on the same piece of material, the faster it will reach it's 'bottom'. Usually this happens to the 'swap' area. The blockchain itself is immutable and reading SD card data does not make it run out that much faster, so considering the end use, SD cards will do just fine.
Just remember, if or when it does happen (the SD card fails), you'll need to re-install your OS again and eventually re-download the entire blockchain again. Using an HDD or SDD will (not prevent, but at least) slow down this problem.

Bitcoin definitely isn't an investment, it's a blockchain based proof of ownership system. That we use it to prove ownership of value, does not mean it's the only thing you can do with it.
We should all stop comparing bitcoin to something that already exists, because bitcoin is (whether you love or hate it) something completely new and different. No one knows how it will behave in the real world, except for the experiences we gain right now.
The creator also didn't give it a 'purpose', he just suggested a system for distributed transactions. So its purpose is not countered by its volatility, because volatility is not a problem in a transaction processing system. It is only a problem if you use it as an investment...

There might be two specific groups of people using Bitcoin (I'm not denying nor confirming there are); investors/speculators and 'darknet' users. One group wants to regulate Bitcoin, while the other group wants to make it more anonymous and absolutely prevent regulation.
Who has the power to 'start' changes to the Bitcoin protocol. And more importantly, who has the power to prevent/veto changes?

I understand. But it kinda insinuates people should just solo mine in order for the 'lottery' to be effective. Meaning that after 3 years you still have the risk of never having 'won' it once.

Just because a block can house 20 Mb, doesn't mean we'll fill it at that rate. At the moment the 1 Mb is still sufficient. Yes, eventually we'll have to move to bigger blocks. Yes, eventually we won't be able to host a full node on a 64Gb SD card. But in a couple of (months / ) years from now, we'll have 128 / 265 Gb SD cards in Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 models.

Everyone and no one has control over the bitcoin software. You could make a forked version on your own.

This sounds promising...
Anyway, when we try to explain (object oriented) software to our not very tech-savvy coworkers (who actually sell the software) we often refer to these objects, server, services and other technical stuff as if we are talking about people.
I would explain bitcoin as if it is run by 1 person in the middle holding a big book of transactions (the ledger) and only 'he' can see what your bank account balance is. When you tell him to transfer your money to someone else, he will. (This well then of course raise questions in most normal people: "But then how does he know it's you?", and that'll get the ball rolling.) Most difficult part about explaining it in court is that you can't really ask the jury if they understand everything you just explained. (Because they might only need one more little detail before they truly get it.) Too bad that option is not available in court...
So what I'm trying to say is, we as human beings are more easily able to grasp weird, vague, sciency stuff when we look at it as if it were human beings.

They are in the electronics market. If you are, then you've heard of Arduino. People that know Arduino also know for every Italian made Arduino there are 9 from China (because of open source hardware and software).

This only means future software updates are not open-source, so they cannot be used by other companies, but we can still look into the code.
It also means that 'gongkai' China will still steal the code and not give a shit about licenses. But this way Trezor can go to a judge, yell copyright infringement and have knock-offs banned from being sold in specific countries. Of course this won't do a lot since China sells them online, people pay with bitcoin and mail won't be regulated that thoroughly... But I guess it's the idea that counts.

@_date: 2015-01-05 13:46:40
That's a very reasonable thought, but there are already protocols in place to make sure their communication is reliable. Furthermore it is very easy to limit software to making 1 - 10 BTC transactions automatically and asking for a human verification (employee on YET another computer) to verify the transaction. Also, when you have a shitload of data, it is quite 'easy' to use data mining and pattern recognition to filter these kinds of irregular transactions. It really is just about using every tool we have within software development to make sure this stuff does not happen.

You are confused. C# actually is one of the fastest growing languages in mobile development. Xamarin actually has a mobile framework that ONLY works with C They also have mobile device cloud testing and other really cool stuff.
Also, some people might see C# as over-engineered, I'm not going to argue with you on that. But C# enables software engineers to achieve more in less time. Lower perfomance was indeed true in 2001, but wake up, this is not 2001 anymore. Performance is on par with the latest C++ versions. (StackOverflow runs on .NET and they require 10 times less server hardware than other websites using PHP with the same number of users).
You can beat on C# / .NET as much as you want to (it was after all developed by evil Microsoft), but then at least bring some REAL arguments...

I'd rather listen to what Satoshi Nakamoto says, than to wait 10 years for a solution. The paper says the community can vote by mining, which shows consensus. Now we're just stalling possible solutions by over thinking them. We're acting as if a 2mb block size would kill the system, I say if we don't try, we won't know. If we'd actually move fast, we could just try a 2mb block size and revert it just as fast as we'd be trying it.

From the Abmahnung Wikipedia: "In theory, this allows anybody that observes a violation of a law that may be covered by an Abmahnung to hire an attorney, have a letter sent, and be reimbursed for the attorney's fees. In practice, a lawyer may do this without having been hired by a client who has been wronged, in essence searching for violators of covered laws and demanding payment from them for having found them. Since the enormous proliferation of web sites, this abuse of the law has led to the so-called Abmahnwelle (-wave), as lawyers and copyright holders are trawling the internet searching for even minor and usually unintended violations of e.g. copyright law, with some law firms sending thousands of letter per year demanding payment."
So what law have you broken then? Germany has freedom of speech.
The budget option would be to get free representation, go to court, make the judge see you are a journalist and you are simply exercising your freedoms, I know Deutschland is very sensitive of its freedoms after WWII.
And if it becomes a pattern (so it would be good if they keep harassing you) counter sue them for harassing a public figure / journalist. Judges hate to set jurisprudence in a negative way (not legally defending critical journalism would be quite negative, legally speaking).

Nodes are responsible for pretty much all communication in the bitcoin system. Not having (enough) nodes creates all sort of problems. Since mining is rewarded, but running a full node (a node that also uploads the blockchain, instead of only downloading it) is not rewarded, so there is a huge difference in the amount of people mining and people running a node.

Yup. We kinda want those new shiny Euro Joint Strike Fighter planes and they cost some big bucks. Gotta get it from somewhere!

I know a lot of miners here in the Netherlands, so I'd say we have 4 times more miners than full node 'owners'. (Maybe 10 times more miners than nodes.) Whereas I imagine China having roughly 10.000 individuals (easily) mining, with 95 'public' nodes.
So, yes, the ratio of miners per node is way higher in China than pretty much any other country in the world (probably because of the Chinese government ban on bitcoins), but I wouldn't want to imply people here in the Netherlands don't mine, because I can personally guarantee we do ;)

On the other hand, a bigger block size allows for more transactions per block (meaning it won't be LIMITED! Since that'd be a problem). And computers do grow every year. Storage becomes cheaper, internet connections become faster, processor become faster, the average computer will have more memory and so on. I'm not saying the bigger block size should be implemented right now. But I do think the protocol can grow with it's time, don't you?

If the increase in block size would be coupled with pruning, that would mean blocks were bigger, but the 'history' of the entire blockchain would not have to be maintained (some of it can be pruned).
So, yes, there would be a bigger load on the internet connection (bigger blocks to download / upload), but not necessarily on storage (bigger, but less blocks to store). (Correct me if I'm wrong!) Which would not make people close down their node?
