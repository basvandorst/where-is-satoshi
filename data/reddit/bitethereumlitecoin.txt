Hell yeah! I'm still HODLing my Enron shares. Haven't lost a fucking dime because you only lose when you sell.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:23:30
Quite important what direction you're approaching the price at though...
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:02:11
Ahahahaha! You fucking massive cuck. AHAHAHAHAHHA!
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:25:03
Holy fuck you're oblivious to how much of an asshole you sound.
"Guys, guys, please stop locking in your own profits so I can get to a completely arbitrary psychological price to lock out my own profits and in doing so provide downward price pressure to anyone trying to cash out at a price level above me".
Grow up and stop acting like a little bitch.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:47:37
"Suckers", lol.
Just checked your post history and you cashed out like a little bitch about 8 hours ago because you have weaker hands than a 90 year old with parkinsons and couldn't handle some volatility. This is despite going balls deep with your life savings too.

TIL the ceo of a local TV station is most old people.
@_date: 2019-03-31 12:41:53
TIL "How to Explain Bitcoin to Older Generations" involves ranting like a pseudo-intellectual idiot.
Most older people would tune out within seconds if presented with this drivel.
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:31:57
That's...not what the image shows.

BTC was the same price this time last year and didn't top $20,000 despite absolute mania-levels of FOMO. What will change this time round for it to hit $40k? This seems like absolutely delusional optimism.
@_date: 2018-10-27 12:25:37
Box size is relative market cap. You are blind if you think the BTC box is over 50% of the entire area.
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:31:58
Fuck me I'm being an idiot. I had in my head the BTC dominance was 35% or so....just checked and it is indeed back over 50%. God damn the market is worse shape than I realised.
@_date: 2018-10-26 09:44:03
I guess that makes me a total newb then. Let's find out in 2 months.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:58:43
Big difference between getting involved in a coin that is mooning to catching a falling knife.


I seem to have had this window of opportunity open up quite a bit over the last 6 months. I'm ok thanks.
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:28:08
So a 233% increase, not 333%.
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:56:15
Frame it the other way round and the dollar loses it's power. Instead of "How much is a bitcoin? About $10,000!" you can say "how much is a dollar? about 10,000 satoshis"
Change the frame of reference. Ultimately bitcoin and dollars are immaterial and used as a means to acquire things of "actual" value. Like lambos.

Wow, that's a hell of a straw man. Getting pulled over for speeding is not remotely equivalent to knowingly facilitating and profiting from hundreds of thousands of drug deals. I could easily throw this back at you and say: 
"You don't get the death penalty after finally being apprehended by police during a month long murderous rampage where you slaughtered hundreds of people. As also you should not get 2 life sentences for profiting off of drugs. Especially on a first time offense."
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:32:07
Completely ridiculous strawman.
He PROFITED from and facilitated every single drug sale on the site. Selling drugs in most countries is ILLEGAL hence why he's in prison and will never see freedom again.
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:34:59
The guy took a cut from every drug deal done on the site. It amazes me that people think he's "innocent" of essentially profiting from thousands of drug deals.
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:31:38
Because he facilitated hundreds of thousands of drug deals.
@_date: 2019-01-04 13:35:35


Let's not gloss over the fact that this "single company" happens to be one of the largest companies to ever exist in terms of market cap and revenue, pulling in revenues in the region of a quarter of a trillion dollars a year...
Let's not gloss over the fact that the percentage drop in the stock price is one of the most savage aforementioned company has ever experienced in a single day...
So, to recap, one of the largest companies ever founded experienced one of the largest drops in share price...and this figure equates to the market cap of bitcoin.
To me this doesn't tell me we're early adopters. It means bitcoin is already fucking huge. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:41:58
Put the koolaid down, holy shit.
@_date: 2019-01-09 12:27:33
Found the koolaid drinking retard everyone!
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:49:33


Yeah...that was my point. You're the one equating being pulled over for speeding with profiting from thousands of drug deals. I made a similarly absurd comparison to show how DUMB of a straw man you were making. Apparently you totally missed the point.
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:28:55


Good grief you are a bell end.

You think Rubin is a conservative? Fucking top kek.

But...but that wasn't true socialism! This time it will be different!!
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:27:08
I'm interpreting this as you being an insufferable cunt to your family last thanksgiving about crypto and now they're enjoying some well deserved schadenfreude. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:10:15
Yeah, just let your unrealized loses continue to build. Idiot. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:26:47
Cars are legal and essential infrastructure for modern societies to function. What an absurd and poorly thought through analogy.

He took commission on the sale of drugs. He was selling drugs.

The ultra wealthy don't buy lambos. They buy Bentleys, yachts and private jets and pay other people to drive / sail / fly them.

@_date: 2018-12-07 15:45:04
No I'm not with you, you fucking idiot. You only load up when the market is in obvious recovery. Right now you're the moron standing outside while it's raining knives with your arms outstretched screaming "DAE like these awesome discounts???!!! XD"
Have fun throwing good money after bad.

Show me a "HODLER" of Enron shares that looks like the guy in that picture. 
The HODL meme is the most cringe-worthy thing to come out of Reddit, which is really saying something. Using it unironically also announces to anyone who isn't a rank amateur investor that you are, on the other hand, a rank amateur investor.
