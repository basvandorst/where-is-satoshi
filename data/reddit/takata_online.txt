Mining. A decent computer can get 10k a day easily. Check for way more options... giveaways.. raffles... handouts... random tipping..

Still buy? How more people buy how higher the price goes again:)

Dat capslock title...
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:05:45
I said that in my first comment:)
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:10:45
Thanks in that case!

Sounds about right. By the way, my bad. I seperate drugusers and junks for the reason some drugs are legal in my country. Drugsusers and junks are not the same for me.

It is just so funny to see people jumping on board to go for quick profit. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:03:35
You ARE Bitcoin!

Not according to the reddiquete. He is still on topic.

You may want to delete your comment, I tipped in some subs before, and was one of the places where I noticed the chance exist you get downvoted to oblivion :( +10 doge
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:21:05

@_date: 2013-12-01 16:00:17
Smart move:)

Most bitcoingamblesites dont hoard 10% of the money. I dont like sites that are that greedy.
Edit: typo
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:24:48
But pressing .com on my mobile is easier :(
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:36:26
Seriously. Dude. Are you hitting on a person with a "mrs." in her name?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:43:49
Neat:) collect free bitcoinprograms will become more profitable in the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:22:55
I want to clarify that junks wont use Bitcoins. To big of a hassle and to long for deliveribg. (They need the shots NOW. Not one month later). But its awesome you are going to use Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:05:04
Lol dude, It is maybe better to delete your comment, downvoted me to oblivion when I tipped doge in here. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:48:17
Sounds like one if the best persons to get introduced to it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:31:17
Those 13 year olds with masks. How?
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:33:11
No... Altcoins sucks. It is giving Bitcoin just laydown on going mainstream. Let Bitcoin take more time to gain PR before you give the rest a try. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:59:34
Let thrm sign up. Only better for the bitcoinprice :)
