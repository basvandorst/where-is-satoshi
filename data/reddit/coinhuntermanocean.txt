Why does a chart like this always magically come out when the price is down or stagnating, but not at the time when the prediction is most needed? Seems like fluff.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:33:48
There's no other systems available which ensure transaction integrity on a decentralized ledger other than those which require high mining fees?
Are ASIC abusing centralized mining cartels which extort higher fees out of unsuspecting user transactions another "feature" of Bitcoin, along with the slow network and already high transaction fees?

Post a link to where they claim the only reason they stopped accepting it was due to price volatility?
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:36:40
I found this inside the link:
“Transactions fees have skyrocketed from a few cents a few years back to tens of dollars, making Bitcoin almost unusable for microtransactions, where some users end up paying a large percentage of the transaction total as a transaction fee.”
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:30:19
That's still too much these days. And I've never gotten a transfer at near that cost.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:42:46
There’s coins that even if they were $100,000 each would have transaction values of fractions of a cent or less. 
I don’t know why “yes fees are high shut up” is an argument.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:59:15
At this point why do we even need Bitcoin? Is there not a coin which can do its job better? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:58:42
You don’t buy something that cheap with Bitcoin due to the fees. Bitcoin isn’t a good way to pay for Twitch. Since Coinbase is partnered the best way to pay if you’re paying Crypto would be LTC or Eth. Even tho Eth fees are too much still IMO.

You’re acting like your opinion is a fact. And condescending to anyone who doesn’t believe it. Comparing anti-UBI people to flat earthers. ��
Acting like you’re understanding and kind while being a cunt under your breath is so off putting.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:35:50
You care wayyyyyyy to much about what strangers think
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:40:10
This should make Bitcoin blow up

Giving random poverty stricken people money is an ineffective way of reducing extreme poverty overall.
But as long as this is individual charity and non-state enforced at gunpoint I see no issue with people freely spending their money this way.

I know it’s just a meme but Some people are Actually manipulating people to allow them to put their money into a very volatile and risky investment and its sad
Many people thought they were “crypto gurus” during the roaring bull market we had at the end of last year and some of them now lost some friends and family trust

How are you living right now with no private property? Do you co-own everything in your life with a collective of people?
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:56:01
Yep, I’m definitely in the bitcoin subreddit

Bitcoin, the bubble which has been continually popping for 8 years yet somehow still goes up in value 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:31:02
There you have it folks. THE SCIENCE IS SETTLED.

I think you’re giving him too credit.
Everyone knows corrections happen, they are bound to happen. It’s way different than what is going to happen when the Bitcoin bubble actually peaks and pops.

shut up idiot
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:13:07
I mean.... there’s at least 3 obvious reasons why there has been a rise recently, if you can’t name them why are you so certain it’s a bubble set to pop? 
Kinda sounds like you’re extremely new to the space 
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:18:20
5 years bitcoin = $1000 USD each 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:22:33
It could go up or down.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:55:49
I feel like you should know this before buying bitcoin!

How is not risking anything your not willing to lose a large bet?
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:15:37
Make it a wallet that you haven’t used if ya don’t want ppl snooping
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:59:16
Can you elaborate on this? 
Are you saying that the dip would be eaten up quickly within a few percent dip because people are going to be trying to buy in on it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:39
why is it dropping anyone know

@_date: 2017-11-06 02:05:17
it went down since you posted this .gif and i blame you for that
im joking but this is as accurate as any of the prediction and technical analysis ive seen recently
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:43:11
Maybe you shouldn’t invest money in something you don’t know a lot about

Bitcoin price in general, the fork, predictions for the future
so many places and so many different predictions and a lot of them said with certainty. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:21:22
how can you be so brainwashed that you can do zero research and just blurt out buzzwords, pure ignorance
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:11:29
I’m going to do this 100% lol

Wait for 8k for more memes
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:53:35
gold has a market value 1500x the size of bitcoin
and what a market cap 100x bigger or something, bitcoin still can grow without dropping down to levels people think it will drop to
ive seen ppl say bitcoin could drop 80% and then another 90% after that drop possibly, but i don't have a reason to believe that

ron paul save us
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:34:17
with the current market cap we aren't even close to the point where it could be considered in a bubble, bitcoin price will be in the green for years
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:13:19
Can you not go out and buy $10 worth of Bitcoin right now and spend it to buy lunch at a place that accepts Bitcoin payments? Doesn't sound too rare or expensive tbh
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:59:56
It’s gonna be pretty funny when this “bubble” still hasn’t bursted years from now 
Also what kind of idiot would use Bitcoin these days for illicit activities when there are much better privacy coins
This post reeks of someone who read one article on WSJ and now “knows everything” about Crypto
