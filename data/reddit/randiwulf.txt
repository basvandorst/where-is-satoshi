We will see that they do, and we accept it, they are under the same rules and filters as everybody else. As I explained the way you connect are via VPN, so basically everyone is defined as being on the outside. You can't connect to our internal network without a VPN or physical access to your server room.
    
If it's a personal device not controlled by the company, we will not know your username. Info about your device will be logged. We can also see where you are. Not very exactly, but accurate enough that we will probably be able to find out who you are. If you connect via cable, it's actually harder to see where you are, I will know which floor and maybe department depending on that floors layout. We've had to find devices twice the last year as they was clearly infected. One was someone working there from another company and one was a personal PC.

I promptly tested a few others sites also. Nothing suspicious at all.

I didn't see it. I'm at work. We have a porn filter. I'm now logged being blocked by the porn filter.
    
Luckily I'm also the security guy. I needed to test the pornfilter.

Auch, we know a lot, and we don't tell, and we pretend we don't know.
    
We know who struggles in their marriage, who is struggling with diseases, financial stuff and so on.

Yes, WiFi goes via the same IDS and FW as the rest. All company cellphones, tablets and computers are always connected via VPN, even if you are on premises. You have exactly the same environment on your equipment inside as outside. We have a lot of people working remote, actually I am too. I work about 2000km away from main office.
    
The worst breaches we have had have been from the inside. Some because of pure stupidity and some intentional malicious. People take shortcuts, I can understand that. We work hard to maintain a secure environment without making it hard for people to do their work. The way we do it now seem to work OK. Non tech people don't have to think about VPN and stuff. They can work wherever they want and not learn new environments. VPN connects as you log in.
    
Here is how you can get around me if you need to. Use SSH. Set up an SSH tunnel and make sure your DNS queries are routed through that tunnel. SSH is widely used and would not trigger any red flags.

I can assure you, if I catch you using a VPN other than the one of the two we provide and control out of work, you have some explaining to do. Unless you had a good explanation it would be a bigger offence than being caught watching porn. It would trigger a lot of alarms.
