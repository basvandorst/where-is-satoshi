First off, it's decentralized nature means that there is nothing to help stabilize it. It will remain continuously volatile. The fiat nature of bitcoin makes the first point a downside, since there is central authority backing the value through some form of compensation or arbitration in the event of fraudulent activity.  Secondly, it's not backed by anything with intrinsic value. It would be better served being backed up by lead than nothing at all. Thirdly, the system itself is unwieldy for large scale applications. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, which every user has a copy of. No wonder confirmation cycles are ten minutes. That cycle is only going to be longer as the number of users gets bigger. Again, an issue solved by having a centralized system, which bitcoin users tend to shy away from. These are just the initial issues that I can see.

That may be the case for diamonds, but for silver, they're still off.

An unlimited amount of bitcoins can be produced. It's just deflational, rather than inflational. So, instead of adding to the total, it's being divided. It just goes in another direction. And, fiat currency isn't backed by anything of intrinsic value. Bitcoin isn't backed by anything of intrinsic value. Ergo, it is fiat currency.
I don't think you get it. Increasing miners only increases the load on the system. This system was designed too only get so big, and then it loses efficiency beyond that; drastically so. So, even if someone could pay to lower the transaction times, it wouldn't matter at that point. The system would be unusable, because it would be bogged down by its horrible transaction processing procedure.
Plus, the limited nature of bitcoins means that once they hit their peak number of distributed coins, there is no incentive for mining.
Edited for autocorrect failures.

Oh. See, I noticed that you talked about fiat currency as though bitcoin wasn't fiat currency. I just figured you knew what made it any different.
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:33:11
Welcome to bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:04:34
How's it going? Did you see how far down bitcoin went?
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:18:45
My question isn't that difficult. You speak as though bitcoin isn't fiat money. So, what good our commodity determines its value? You know, like when we had gold backed money, rather than put current fiat system.
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:35:22
What product or commodity determines the value of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:11:01
Yeah, because bitcoin is totally replacing real money at an alarming rate with so many banks closing or freezing accounts of bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:58:42
I'd have to say that the hardware issue is also overlooked. Many of their biggest exchanges cannot even handle the rush of panic traffic with the minute amount of current users. Expansion requires vast improvements in hardware capabilities. The kind of delays seen in the bitcoin world would spell disaster for a large market.

I guess, I'm not really seeing how a fixed amount, deflationary currency is any better than an inflationary currency. What happens when new people want to enter into the bitcoin economy in the deflationary period? Do they sit it out, and wait for someone to sell them the amount of bitcoins that they'd like to have? Or, are they entered into the system, reducing everyones' total bitcoins, but increasing the value of bitcoins? If the former, how is that a good thing? If waits are too long, people will just abandon it, decreasing demand, which decreases value. If the latter, what makes the work to make sure you didn't get ripped off (checking the blockchain to see where your missing bitcoins went) not a big enough drawback to turn people away?


So, basically, it won't hit peak until a hundred years, and is still in the inflationary stage. Of deflationary currency is so much better, why not just go all in, and start with the limit? Why go through a period of inflation, if inflation is so bad? It makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:03:02
But it isn't all that revolutionary. Currency had existed for millennia.

What commodity backs bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:24:34
Sweet! Good thing you got in early. You probably should have cashed out when it was at $260. It doesn't look like it'll go back up to that.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:57:48
Still more stable than bitcoin. It took years for that drop in value, where bitcoin only took days, if not hours to drop to 3/4 of its value.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:22:34
You can wax philosophical all you want. It's code breaking being tagged as mining.
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:13:30
With the increasing number of banks refusing to service bitcoin exchange accounts, investment will drop. People don't like to invest in something that they can't cash out on, should something start to go wrong. With a drying up of investors goes the value of bitcoin. If you think it'll get easier, by all means carry on.
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:37:54
1- good! I'm glad we can agree that bitcoin is another fiat currency. I have no issues with that concept. Many bitcoin proponents do, which is odd, since bitcoin is no different.
2- it's unregulated nature makes it impossible to guard against scams, market manipulation, the payer not paying a fee to the miner, counterfeiting schemes, double payment, or money laundering. Granted, some of these things do happen with other currencies, but their difficulty is increasing, and their frequency is low, due to regulation.
3- an increase in miners adding to the difficulty of making transactions spells death to bitcoin being a currency for large scale adoption. To not see this is willful ignorance. Transaction times taking up to an hour? That would kill trade. Seriously, no one would have any reason to choose bitcoin over regulated currency. Remember, just because some see value in something, doesn't mean others will too. This is especially true of something that has an increasing amount of banks refusing to service it's exchanges bank accounts.

I didn't say that they lack a niche. I said that the niche wasn't as a currency or merchant processor, in their current iteration. It has the potential to be something innovative, but people are so hung up on it being a form of currency that it just amounts to a nice experiment in the world of finance, but is ultimately destined to failure.
@_date: 2013-04-30 03:53:07
You do realize that the market price *is* what people usually refer to when they talk about the value of currency, right? Tell me you're not that clueless.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:46:36
"(d) are for the sale of certain items before the seller has control or possession of the item"
I can see that, but my concern was that it didn't specify what kind of items this applied to. Also, drop shipping is not uncommon for online retailers; especially the larger ones. Why would bitpay opt out of being involved with large retailers by design? That seems like such a bad move for something that wants to take off?
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:58:55
Just surviving is hardly replacing banks and credit cards, as was being discussed.

Your currency is fiat currency. Just because it isn't produced by a government doesn't mean it isn't a fiat currency. You said so yourself that it wasn't backed by any commodity or product. Since it is fiat, it's market value is its value.
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:30:21
It is a free market, with no regulation to prevent market manipulation. It's still a dick move though.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:19:42
Could you quote the section that specifies as such?
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:08:04
That's obvious, but doesn't answer my question.
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:01:15
I'd be willing to bet that they'd probably be pissed off that you're trying to give him internet money that he has to go through a bunch of BS to get real money to buy stuff with, because nobody takes bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:50:42
Yeah. It means that even I can see bitcoin isn't undervalued. With the market volatility that it has, it's overvalued.
@_date: 2013-04-29 06:05:07
Why would anyone want to take on the costs, and risks, of such a volatile currency?
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:12:40
It's an interesting experiment in how to make you're own currency, but with the numerous issues it has by design, it's doomed to die out relatively soon. Or, at the very least, relegate itself to a niche market that won't get much bigger than it is now.
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:53:01
It would have to stop being ludicrously volatile first.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:35:40
It doesn't specify that though. They should clarify that in their terms. It would attract more customers.
If they can't handle drop shipping from a small company, why would anyone believe they'll be able to do so in the future? And, why would anyone wait until they're big enough to take larger customers to do something that was so problematic that they didn't bother with it in the first place?

Bitcoin hashes bitcoin transactions. Big whoop! That does fuck all for anything outside of bitcoin.
How is what I said a straw man of bitcoin? You said it wasn't backed by anything. I repeated that notion. Then, I went on to demonstrate that currencies already exist. So, it isn't filling that niche. Merchant processors already exist, and have a better model for handling fraud. So,.it isn't filling that niche. Prepaid credit cards exist, and are accepted by most processors. So,anonymous transactions are already possible without bitcoin too.
Doing DDoS attacks on the individual do nothing anyhow. They just delay individual transactions. Doing so on an exchange has already been shown to be more damaging. DDoS attacks aren't done to individual sellers because it's pointless. However, network strength is a good way to prevent them. Try it on Google, Amazon, or any if the big networks. It's fruitless, because they can handle it, unlike the bitcoin exchanges.

If you tip in BTC, you deserve every ounce of spit you get in your food afterward.
@_date: 2013-08-09 18:41:59
On a small scale, with relatively few people entering and exiting the economic system, it isn't tough to keep track of the value, and how much you hold. However, on a larger scale, it just sounds like an accounting nightmare. Also, has the number of bitcoins peaked yet, or is it still in the inflationary period, where it still grows with the increase in participants?
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:15:41
That makes sense. However, reading through their terms of service, it would be impossible to use them for online purchases. Check out section 3, part D. They don't state what items they are referring to, which leaves it wide open to interpretation by bitpay. If I was a merchant interested in bitpay, clarification would be needed, since anything can fall into that category.
@_date: 2013-04-29 07:28:17
It's still a volatile currency. Hell! It changed 20 cents in the minute I watched it.
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:48:17
I didn't say that I didn't have any market knowledge. I know enough to see that bitcoin is an overvalued novelty currency. It serves a very niche market, and has had a recent spat of media attention, which has driven the price up, but it has a limited use. The exchanges are running into problems with the banks that they hold accounts with. There is the issue with the technology not being ready for an upswing in customers using bitcoin. And, these are just the problems from what I've read in the past several days in passing.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:33:21
I stopped there because they've shown that they're no more knowledgeable of markets than I am.
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:50:38
With more banks refusing to service bitcoin exchange accounts, how will it replace online banking?

What commodity backs bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:45:12
So, bitcoin is not backed by anything. How is that not a fiat currency?
At least with other fiat currencies, the force of law, and some sort of central bank is there to back their value.
The problem is that there are already currencies out there, with more stable values, as well as already established systems of exchanges for them. Not only this, but none of the things you mentioned are impossible, or weren't even already in existence at the time bitcoin came out. And, seriously, you have to be joking about DDOS attacks. DDOS attacks seem to impact trading of bitcoins on an almost regular basis. How is that in any way evidence that it prevents those types of attacks?

"1 : an economic good: as a : a product of agriculture or mining b : an article ofcommerce  especially when delivered for shipment c : a mass-produced unspecialized product"
I'm not seeing how it fits the applicable definition. It doesn't fit A, since it isn't farmed or mined. They can call it mining, but that doesn't make it mining, since it's just allowing you're computer to decrypt code. It doesn't fit B, since it isn't shipped. It doesn't fit C, since it's specialized.
Explain it to me.

Not even then. At least with foreign currency, the server knows that there is a market for it, and that it isn't hard to find. Leaving a bitcoin wallet address is just like leaving a flier for a gold into cash place. They're going to look at it, wonder what it is for a brief moment, remember what cheapskate left some stupid flyer as a tip, and toss it.
