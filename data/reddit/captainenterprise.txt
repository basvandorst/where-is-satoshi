BTC is currently centralized and you don't seem to care. Development? Centralized. Governance? Centralized. Mining? Centralized(5 pools control 65% of mining). So who is centralized again?

Very well said.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:20:36
That isnt a reason not to use smart contracts.

DCG invested in Blockstream too though.

So BTC is going to do something they've fought for the last 4yrs to absolutely NOT do? Sure they could do a hardfork all of a sudden, but then they still have Segwit, they still have their corporate interests to answer to. All of those things I thought about.

Objectively prove to me how Bitcoin is less centralized than BCH. Details and facts please.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:21:27
I fully understand consensus. There's many layers to all this. It's sad you don't understand that. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:26:18
I wonder how this compares to Ethereum Sprites?
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:32:03
I agree about the author and while my feelings are not that strong I see where he's coming from. Corporate interests are on both ends of Segwit. I fully believe that. I know you're not looking at it ideologically but we're not at a point where we can ignore that yet. Bitcoin isnt mature enough. Segwit will lead to hub-spoke model which will bring us back to square one with banks/3rd-party. I feel like all this commotion however it plays out isnt good for the brand that's why I upped investments in other legit cryptos like Monero, VTC, LTC, ETH. Cryptocurrency isnt going away but I can't say that for Bitcoin regardless of the options of how this plays out.

Currently 5 mining pools cover 65% of BTC mining operations. Not concerned?

If you believed in non government you would stay on chain as long as possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:46:30
Not gospel, maybe not. However off chain networks are certainly a major divergence from what Bitcoin started with and clearly intended. The chain of signatures will be broken with LN. This makes way for your traditional hub spoke which is where we are now with centralized authorities. Everything needs to be on chain while Bitcoin continues to build credibility and maturity. SegWit derails that.

Sorry I worry about more than miners when it comes to centralization. You're very short sighted. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:39:16
Incorrect. Until you change your thinking you won't get it. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:12:00
The only difference between SegWit1X and SegWit2X is 1MB. SegWit is the issue at hand. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:51:46
Why can't you? Who says? We're no where close to maxing out on chain solutions for transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:52:30
I am in the US as well completely agree about the debt situation. I want no part of it. People talk about a Bitcoin bubble, the entire US economy is a huge bubble. 
Bitcoin used to be well positioned for that but think about it. How will that be maintained with Segwit? Why do that then? They should have never added it. Please do more research on it and come to your own conclusion. Good luck with the next 2 weeks!

This is why I moved 85% of my BTC holding to BCH last week. Take emotion and attachment out of it and think about NOW. Right now the way to solve this problem is increase the block size keep it moving. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:07:30
BCH taking over is not "scorching everything". BCH is the truest to the original whitepaper. Segwit is an abomination. I own BTC, BCH, and many other coins but let's be honest here. Segwit is a massive divergence which will do nothing but bring in divisive corporate interests to BTC. DCG is just the start. Look at how Mastercard is involved in this. Who do you think invests in DCG?
