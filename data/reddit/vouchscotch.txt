I hope we survive this phenomenal disaster. Damn.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:43:40
Accurate meme again. Love these memes. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:52:32
Some next generation website.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:42:43
Yes! buy buy buy! this will give newcomers a huge advantage.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:56:48
It was having some issues, probably some kind of bug.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:30:44
I hope it will come true.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:36:21
haha totally agree on this. Bitcoin is just a rollercoaster.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:58:58
That's the spirit :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:48:00
Feeling rich, in 2005.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:05:00
Through Bitfinex I hope to buy some BTC while this crash is happening. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:13:26
great choice! I love Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:34:02
Probably. Keep having faith guys, before you know it this crash will become history.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:09:04
Accurate post.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:39:21
1. Use Bitfinex
2. Keep active on forums leek these
3. Know your stuff
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:21:07
I'm not worried about Bitfinex. They are still one of the biggest platforms. Bitfinex is really steady and won't get down that easily.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:15:07
I'm using Bitfinex. It is the best platform I've had so far. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:25:38
haha alright, I like that one.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:40:56
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:57:22
lol. accurate.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:35:08
you can probably wait pretty long for Bitfinex to collapse. Bitfinex is really steady as a platform, I think the best so far. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:41:30
haha it turned so fast.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:08:57
I'm still believing in Bitcoin, especially with the hypes these days. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:44:58
haha because of this I like february.
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:20:13
Haha pretty accurate
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:53:11
at least you tried :)
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:18:22
5$ USD? you won't make a lot of profit on that. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:19:54
I recommend using Bitfinex. Really steady platform, friendly userinterface, really helpful and good support. I never experienced any problems with this platform. Also their transactions are really fast. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:41:18
thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:48:15
Great news.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:01:57
makes me think of those 'doctors' in advertisements who claim they have a product which will make you look good and healthy, but after all it's just a fraud. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:25:09
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:10:52
seems a little bit suspicious.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:28:59
I still like using Bitfinex, best there is for me.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:03:21
haha pretty accurate. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:16:04
A nice bike is also appreciated.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:04:19
I'm not worried about it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:59:02
haha accurate.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:37:43
I would use Bitfinex. Never had any problems with this platforms, it has also very friendly userinterface. I would take a look at it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:58
Well, you shouldn't took the risk then. But holding is always an option, just be patient. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:01:17
Bitcoin is the most famous coin there is. That is why. If new people talk about cryptocurrency they talk most of the time about bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:09:30
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:54:02
Looks cool!
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:50:24
it's inspiring.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:17:10
creative, I must say.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:28:54
Try using localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:48:47
but at the same time it smells.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:41:04
lol! But HODL is also working fine for me. Really easy thing to do with Bitfinex as my main platform. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:54:43
wow. You were being really optimistic then. Probably the best thing to do is to hold, otherwise you'll probably experience big losses. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:16:30
I think that money never really so hyped was as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:53:41
that's so much indeed.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:55:00
Almost KO.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:11:38
Your English isn't bad. Great advice by the way :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:53:16
haha pokemon car, wow. Media these days.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:10:02
Don't you have any friends who are an adult? Some family? there has to be someone who wants to help you. :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:10:43
Seems legit, its a repeating pattern. Value increases, people buy, coin reaches its 'limits', poeple sell, coin will decrease in value and people start buying again because they think it cannot go any lower but only increase in value. We like to hope and have faith in the upcoming periods. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:58:45
Yes, I have my trust in Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:31:13
Beneath $10K! Who would've thought ;p
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:41:46
I'm still noliving on Bitfinex! Making profits all day long :)
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:24:47
But I like memes :(
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:08:48
hm, looks interesting. But I like to use Bitfinex. Best platform for me.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:48:31
who would've thought.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:28:57
hodling isn't really a bad idea. It will get back on it's feet.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:48:36
It's just my opinion. I never had any issues with it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:06:44
I think it's also a good time to invest. It's not dead, it's becoming more populair each day. Especially in this dip people will buy because it's so low and they have faith in Bitcoin it's future. Everyone will be hoping that it will reach $20k again, so it's gonna be hyped again.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:07:19
Actually it's not dumb, it's just making it a little bit more exciting for the market.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:40:20
Still seeing my profits rising on Bitfinex :) 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:13:43
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:14:25
maybe not the best idea. You should be really thankful to your parents that they bought a life insurance. Be wise my man. spend your money in a good way, not everything in cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:38:03
then let us hope I won't come that far! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:09:45
pure art. Accurate. Love it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:38:38
I'm glad you got your confirmation.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:14:16
well, you're not the only one having this issue ;)
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:15:53
Step in guys, at least this ride in the rollercoaster won't cost us any money. We're all in the same cart.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:46:53
I think Voldemort would win this time. I'm sorry for the spoiler :( 
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:43:20
the price of the bitcoin when you sell it : the price of the bitcoin when you bought it = the multiplier of your profit. Or just Price of the bitcoin when you sell it - the price of the bitcoin when you bought it = your profit.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:45:55
Maybe. What are you're going to do? Hodling or holdinng?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:39:16
haha same.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:00:02
pretty accurate.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:00:49
nowshady is right.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:49:13
Im still Hodling and I'm making some real profits on Bitfinex. I really like their platform, because it is really reliable and steady. They also have great support, I would really recommend using it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:42:13
haha keep dreaming my boy, keep dreaming.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:51:57
good job. On your way to those lambo's.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:45:44
ah yea. Crawling to that lambo. I will get there one day!
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:11:29
good job.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:57:29
My question is, why didn't you sell it earlier? You could expect that it would crash and the Bitcoin was unbelievable high. I think you should hold it and hope it wil rise again. Best of luck mate. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:37:07
He's right. Very risky what you're doing.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:34:55
I'm also using Bitfinex. Best platform I have had so far. Very easy user interface, great support, really reliable and very fast transactions. It also offers the most liquid exchange of the world.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:59:56
I would change to Bitfinex. It is my favorite.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:11:45
I think you achieved it! congrats.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:20:03
haha yes indeed.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:31:56
Sounds good!!
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:38:36
that is not really something new.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:53:56
that's is huge thing to process. Wish you the best of luck man.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:58:52
hope you will get it canceled!
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:19:58
also very accurate. But still waiting for the twist. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:42:57
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:37:32
Everything will be alright guys. Keep watching the current activity of cryptocurrency on platforms like Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:52:57
don't see any blood. But it's a piece of art :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:43:53
Keep praying!
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:49:39
hm, around the 30K I think. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:56:06
if it will be that great, you wil donate me a lambo right? thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:55:01
wow! expected it a little bit.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:56:59
I'm just using Bitfinex. Works perfectly for me.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:58:20
HODL now. It is relatively low now.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:30:33
haha 'sweated like a sprinkler'. Makes me laugh :) Good you did some HODL. Wish you the best of luck.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:28:12
sounds really useful! Did anyone use it already? let me know.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:30:09
I agree on that, don't worry guys. Keep believing :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:12:22
Oeh! I like that.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:40:01
Yes, but not that much. It was something with the Korean government and the chinese celebrating new year.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:24:26
I hope it get fixed.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:07:26
Wow. That's a lambo.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:31:22
It depends on when you bought it, but yeah keep holding it. Bitcoin will get back on it's feet because of the new bitcoin holders. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:54:51
HODL it is. HODLing all day long on Bitfinex. Love it to see my profits go up :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:17:00
wow :O
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:44:18
Dipping in the dip, buy in the dipping dip?
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:47:45
too bad, but luckily I'm still making some profit on Bitfinex. :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:59:41
I'm still buying some Bitcoins and Ethereum on Bitfinex. Seeing my profits rise :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:42:27
we'll keep that in mind! Let's see if you are right.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:30:10
I hope this will become global, that woul be great.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:51:05
interesting to follow these dips. Especially how others react to it. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:42:12
It makes me smile a little bit.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:12:03
good choice.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:46:05
pretty fast :o
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:48:09
wow. that was a bold move.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:49:45
Probably this is the time I move to Belarus.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:02:21
Can you give me Santa's address so I can get one from him aswell, he didn't leave it for me :&lt;
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:41:18
Try to contact their support but dont think you will be getting response anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:09:47
Only 3 mins left, damn it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:42:30
Merry Christmas true hodler!
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:46:04
Whoever says something like that, just send them this link.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:48:23
Thank you for the heads up.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:49:16
That truck is carrying 3-4 Bitcoins and there is none guarding them? WTF!
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:57:45
We'll see.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:09:57
Well, this makes my day.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:29:18
haha well, yes. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:08:47
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:50:12
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:21:23
Great tactics! I would recommend it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:31:03
If you bought above 17K you should probably go on a holiday for a year.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:05:00
You can't judge me because of that.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:22:10
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:43:55
' I don't care anymore ' 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:39:30
Interesting and impressive.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:33:39
Aii, that hurts!
