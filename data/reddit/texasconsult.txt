Why was this downvoted? Not quite what I was asking for but it's an interesting concept, especially since some mining pools have come close to reaching 51%.

[This]( article has a list of why Bitcoin is bad.  To sum it up:
- Huge Carbon footprint, which will only grow until 2140
- Bitcoin mining software being distributed as malware (zombie computers)
- Mining is more profitable to people who steal electricity (awards theives)
My own opinion is that Bitcoin is inherently bad because it allows for people to evade taxes - and taxes are a necessary evil for a functioning society.  Its sort of a Me vs Us mentality.  Its great for me cause Im making money, but if you look at it from the 10000 feet view, its probably hurting society as a whole.  How would you like it if CEOs started hiding money in Bitcoin instead of using offshore accounts.
Also it favors the rich over the poor - the ones who can afford the best rigs are the ones who hold the wealth.  
Anyways, even if its bad and we all know its bad, the greedy and selfish nature (tragedy of the commons) is that each of us will invest in it and support it to get our usefulness out of it while thinking that we do not contribute any ill affects to everyone else.

Stupid question, how easy is it to get malware from accidentally visiting a site like that?

But a buy wall giving in the same time/day the panic selling happens Could be the cause.

Found a bug on your site.  Registered an account with a 26 character password.  Login page maxes out at 20 characters.  So I cant log into my account.  Thus I cant really link my account either

I work with L3 East but that doesn't necessarily mean I work in the crypto field. I'd say 90% of the people at that plant have minimal knowledge of crypto even though that's their focus. Every engineering company needs it's quality assurance, thermal, structure, electrical... Engineers. It's a very weak correlation to draw

Hopefully you won't regret this some day when bitcoin explodes!

This could be a few things besides insider trading
1. Buy wall at $261 gave in
2. Announcement wasn't released as expected on Thursday night and panic selling happened

Can you expand on this? Why?

Can someone educate me on the difference between an exchange and a brokerage?  
Also, is there an opportunity for an existing service that is registered in all 50 states (such as western union) to fill this need?
