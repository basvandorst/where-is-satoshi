I didn’t recommend her to invest in it. She saw I was looking at other investments and asked what I would invest in for the best return. Calm down, boomer.

Nah not at all. You’re just being a condescending asshole for absolutely no reason. If you actually read what I said, instead of projecting your beliefs, you would’ve realized that I urged her to go do her own research and form her own opinions. I simply told her what would’ve given the best return. Statistically, I’m not wrong.

It gave me an outlook on what bitcoin is so I definitely appreciate the feedback. I’m doing research on it as well because the gains are unlike any other asset I’ve come across. Would definitely be a nice asset to add to my retirement plan. I’m 20 right now and putting awake 25% of my paychecks into stocks/forex and I think I’ll put away 5% to start so even if btc goes to 0, I’ll have only lost 5%

Will someone educate me on what him having to buy back half the btc he said he had, actually means for the market? I don’t really understand why this is a huge deal

Lol I know it’s not going to zero, I was just using that as a worst case scenario

I’m young and only have roughly $300 a month I can put in:( hopefully I’ll save up enough to buy a house in that time

Should’ve invested in ETFs
