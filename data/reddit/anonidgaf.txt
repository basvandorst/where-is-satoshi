Do not quote me on this but from what I have read and my experience owning a business, the average is roughly 1.5% fee on VISA, varying with the risk of the product.  So yeah, I can see Bitcoins as a huge market for riskier products (think virtual gold for online games, porn, VPNs, etc). If we look at it from a 1.5% fee average, it still does not make sense for the consumer to go through the motions of buying BTC, but then there are markets where it would make sense.
However, lets not forget that merchants will also have additional accounting fees for short term capital gains and losses for recording and reporting these transactions.
Totally agree on the benefit to the merchant. I would be wary of paying with BTC on an auction site like eBay without some type of escrow. eBay warns users not to use payment methods without consumer protection.

How do you feel about the additional risk of storing the coins? Can the average consumer be trusted with an electronic wallet? I understand cash poses a risk of theft as well however the consumer can easily and confidently deposit cash in the bank and assume full safety. 
In the future if there are encrypted wallets and the wallet gets stolen there still is a possibility for hackers to brute force their password. (I hate going down this road because we do not have a firm grasp on potential ways to secure coins.)
So in addition to my initial expenses mentioned in my original post, there is a cost of securely storing your coins.
