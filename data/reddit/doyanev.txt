It would be easier. Except that what they're doing is wrong at the very least, if not fraud. And if I'm to lose my privacy either way, taking them to court is the only way to do anything about it.

Yeah, but they've given me no choice. It's either 1. lose all my money, 2. call them and lose my privacy, or 3. sue them and lose my privacy.

Yes, as are "no background check required" and "no personal interview with your mother required", but you would be outraged if someone took your cash for a product and then demanded those things under the threat of keeping your money and property otherwise.  
On their website under FAQ, these are the instructions for purchasing:  
"1 - Select "Buy Coins"  
 2 - Choose the cryptocurrency you want to purchase  
 3 - Have your receiving address ready. The kiosk will scan your address if it's in the *QR-code format only.*  
 4 - Insert bills  
 5 - Click "Done". The cryptocurrency will be sent to your wallet  instantly. Sometimes transactions are delayed if the cryptocurrency  network is congested.  
 6 - The kiosk will print a receipt. Please keep it for your records"
"Sometimes, due to network congestion or security concerns, transactions  may be delayed up to several hours. Please keep your receipt and contact  our support team at [support if you haven't received your cryptocurrency within 12 hours of the purchase."
The closest they get to indicating anything like this is the vague "security concerns" for a delay up to "several hours", and to contact their support team (via email, which I did), after 12.
Along with their "No ID Required" advertising, all of this leads a buyer to expect a cash purchase, respecting their privacy, not a hostage situation. The implied contract is deposit cash -&gt; receive BTC, nothing more.
