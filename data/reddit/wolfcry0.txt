I live in a town of 1200 people who are mostly farmers, I think I'll have to stick with the online exchanges for now haha.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:34:35
What are the other options for trading crypto right now?
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:10:12
If you give a random app API access with keys that are set to anything but read only you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:09:48
Gemini would probably be your best bet.
GDAX is the other option but they've been having issues with large deposits.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:59:57
No it's not, they're just pointing out the risk of trading.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:34:41
Yeah I don't really understand that either, some exchanges require no personal info but they're still centralized and owned by one company.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:07:07
Around $16 probably, assuming the exchange doesn't have a withdraw fee on top of it.
Using ETH is a better option if you can swap it on the same exchange before withdrawing, fees are much less.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:32:16
They have USD/ETH though, unless you're holding bitcoin that's a better way of moving funds around.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:19:47
Do you have a link to that? I'm just starting to do the same thing now and buying really cheap ones that I think will do well.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:37:41
Don't use online wallets in general seems like good advice.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:33:19
Don't use authy, it uses SMS as a way to verify which isn't safe.
Authenticator plus is a good option.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:33:57
Authenticator plus lets you back everything up.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:42:13
I like Exodus, it's one of the easiest to use and looks nice, but I'm still a bit wary of it at this point.
Jaxx doesn't work that well, it's slow to do things and generally confusing at first.
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:50:01
This can't be real lol.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:31:52
Keep trying, it took me like 10 tries.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:08:22
It's been about 14 days for me so far, I think they got a big rush of applications this month or something.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:32:39
Use coinbases GDAX exchange, they have no fee right now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:09:45
Unless I'm wrong if you do that then you can't recover it either if you lose your phone.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:40:12


Yeah especially when investing in chunks barely more than a lunch/dinner out costs, not like that's going to be much more than a "eh" reaction if it disappears.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:37:42
The ID verification?
It uses your coinbase account, you just have to do the ID thing.
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:58:16
??????????????? 
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:18:29
It makes sense, I don't want to use it because it might change so drastically so quickly, both value and transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:18:40
That's their point I think, it's a downside of crypto that there's no protection against this sort of thing.
@_date: 2018-10-12 13:03:30
No, your firewall doesn't affect other people.
@_date: 2018-11-02 15:24:24
We can either have decentralized and somewhat-anonymous (or fully anonymous) currency, or we can control it and catch people like this easily.
Can't have both!
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:42:37
It seems to let me do it without any trouble.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:10:14
Oh it's not instant but it doesn't care about the amount.
I'm no longer using Coinbase/GDAX though, I've switch to Gemini.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:30:09
Bookmark your exchanges or type the URL in, don't click links. That's online banking 101 right there.
