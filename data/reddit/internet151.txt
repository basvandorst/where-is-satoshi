Here is the original post that the OP deleted:
"So I was in school on Friday (I'm in jr high) and I was talking to my friend about Bitcoin and sidechains before class when my teacher came up to me all red in the face and told me I should know better than to talk about things like that at school since they are used for drugs.
I ended up getting sent to the principal and I tried to explain that I was interested in Bitcoin because I like computers and he said the staff knew about things like Silk Road and what people really used them for so it fell under their zero tolerance policy and I got suspended for a day (Monday).
This whole thing has left me really sad and frustrated and I wondered if any of you had some advice on what I can do to get involved with Bitcoin as a kid and still stay out of trouble with adults?
Edit: I didn't expect this to get this much attention or to be called fake, I will update with proof tomorrow (sorry I am not at home now). Thank you to the people with advice, and to the person who gave me a bitcoin tip, I will figure out how that works tomorrow too!"

You didn't seem to understand what I meant about BTC mixers, so let me clarify what happens here.
Step 1. You use a service to mix your BTC with other people's coins, taking different coins out of a service like Silk Road's mixer. (
Step 2. You now own different "coins" and can freely cash them out.
Good luck stopping that.

TQ is Total Queued work items.
ST is STaged work items (ready to use).
SS is Stale Shares discarded (detected and not submitted so don't count as rejects)
DW is Discarded Work items (work from block no longer valid to work on)
NB is New Blocks detected on the network
LW is Locally generated Work items (during slow server providing work)
LO is Local generation Occasions (server slow to provide work)
RF is Remote Fail occasions (server slow to accept work)

I have to agree, the way this ad is presented seems like it would appear fishy or untrustworthy to someone who doesn't know what Bitcoin is.
If you really want to promote bitcoin, talk to small business owners and get them accept it and put up a small sign saying "Bitcoin accepted here!".

Shutting down all broadband and cell phone Internet providers like Gadaffi did still couldn't stop Bitcoin in the USA. The network traffic is so small people could still use 56k dial-up connections to do bitcoin business. Some people used dial-up in Egypt during the revolution too.

I find phoenix with the phatk kernel is currently faster than anything else for Radeon HD 58xx series cards.
@_date: 2011-09-10 08:49:38
cgminer 1.6.2 uses diapolo's modified phatk kernel by default from 2011-08-11 I think.

I'm pretty sure running 96 GPU's would make a home uninhabitable due to the tremendous heat generated by all that.
@_date: 2011-07-21 22:27:25
FPGA's or ASIC's are way too expensive right now and would take too long to pay off.

12 and 2 am or pm, and what time zone?
@_date: 2011-05-29 04:09:14
Here's a simple guide on how to get started mining with your GPU.
@_date: 2011-06-01 06:37:36
Nice idea, except the whole issue of public email harvesting for spam.
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:45:54
I was not aware of this, I stand corrected.
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:46:39
Your OK with people ordering assassinations running around free then?
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:58:07
They never existed due to Ross being manipulated by the feds to think they were real. Still though, if he's making orders like that against other individuals real or fake that makes him a danger to society to some degree.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:37:46
Everything you said is true, but you're forgetting the assassinations he paid for in BTC to the federal agents. I think most people will agree the silk road was a net positive for society, but putting hits out on people is not OK.
EDIT: nevermind, i stand corrected by @_date: 2013-04-20 11:12:52
You're allowed to pat yourself on the back when bitcoin's market cap overtakes google's stock (263.69B).
Until then there's still plenty of work to be done on making bitcoin more mainstream.
@_date: 2013-03-13 00:27:29
I don't run this at home, and I estimate I'm currently mining about triple what I'm paying in electric.
@_date: 2013-06-28 10:11:07
I would do this, but I think It would be silly in my case as I have the only ad already within a ~100 mile radius.
@_date: 2013-08-06 13:02:33
It's making about $700/day at the current difficulty level. Still waiting for the other 2 mini-rigs that were supposed to come with this to complete my 1500 GH/s minirig day 1 pre-order.
@_date: 2013-08-06 15:07:12
I've heard gigavps got the rest of his a week later, so hopefully thats when I get mine. I've tried to contact BFL to find out via email and phone but they are impossible to get in touch with.
@_date: 2013-03-12 23:39:17
I've had about a handful of cards fail over the past 2 years, but I've just RMA'd them and they were fixed pretty quickly. The various manufacturer's never told me what exactly was wrong with the cards or how they fixed them.
I plan on switching my GPU's to LTC once butterfly labs ships their ASIC's here really soon.
Each rig pulls around 750W from what I remember (some variance here).
@_date: 2013-10-11 03:39:53
@_date: 2013-01-10 08:28:16
GPU bitcoin mining is about to become obsolete and completely unprofitable this month unless you have free electric.

Now do one with a beard and a turban.
@_date: 2013-03-01 14:07:49
Looks like bitcoinstore.com has been down for at least the past 14 hours, anyone know what's going on?
@_date: 2013-08-06 16:03:58
Butterfly labs accepts bitcoins directly, so it wasn't necessary to convert out to USD to place an order.
@_date: 2013-08-06 16:08:54
I'll eventually make more than that with the mini-rig. You can never be sure exactly how the future is going to play out so this sort of hindsight advice is pretty silly.
You can never be sure when the optimal times are to buy bitcoins or mining equipment, but mining equipment is usually the safe/better bet in the long run.
Obviously if I had a time machine and knew how future events in the bitcoin marketplace were going to play out I would have done this differently, and would be super-rich right now.
@_date: 2013-08-06 13:46:49
I know I will.
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:07:18
The list of stores you can actually buy a gift card from is like ~50. Many major locations like Walmart and Target are missing from this list and need an option to buy gift cards via the app.
Also, the option to send a card to myself appeared to be missing still.
@_date: 2013-03-18 20:04:33
this guy is trolling
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:36:21
I've done tens of thousands of dollars of business through Capital One to Coinbase over the past several months and nothing's happened to me. Maybe there is more going on here than just "targeting bitcoin"?
@_date: 2013-01-16 04:46:49
Nobody really knows, as the SEC (Security and Exchange Comission) is refusing to publicly discuss their investigation into pirateat40.
@_date: 2013-01-08 00:51:37
i found this post extremely amusing
@_date: 2013-05-26 05:50:20
 for anyone that wants to jump straight to the bitcoin part of this video
@_date: 2013-06-22 04:37:42
I have a mini-rig day one pre-order (june 23rd) and seeing this makes me sad beyond words.
Sunday will make 1 year of waiting for me.
@_date: 2013-06-17 05:25:36
They currently have 0.47430094 BTC donated over the past month or so, so saying they don't have a single coin is somewhat misleading.
I do think there site is worth supporting though and I appreciate  their existence.
@_date: 2013-02-03 20:16:09
oh noez you guys got your asic's 2 weeks sooner
@_date: 2013-06-17 07:30:33
The organization and layout of the site is very nice and convenient though. Personally I'm too lazy to track what time and when 10+ different TV shows come on and when they have new episodes, but eztv makes that easy for me.
So for that, they get props from me.
@_date: 2013-08-06 16:11:47
Well yea I suppose it was through bitpay.
In terms of being better off in USD, yea holding BTC would have probably been more profitable. Nobody can predict the future though.
@_date: 2013-08-06 21:47:56
I'll probably switch to solo mining once my other 2 mini-rigs come in.
@_date: 2013-03-13 02:41:45
Wow litecoin's value went up a lot lately, thanks for the heads up I'll probably switch tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:15:34
I'm surprised to see you posting here again, I thought you abandoned bitcoin completely almost 2 years ago.
I'd give campbx a shot, but their market depth is way too shallow for my needs.
@_date: 2013-08-06 15:03:21
the 1500 gh/s minirig was about $30,500 to pre-order up until march this year or so, which is the price i got.
@_date: 2013-01-10 08:03:43
I've been mining with about $30k worth of GPU's for almost 2 years now, which are barely profitable nowadays.
My current equipment is irrelevant, but I have 2 mini-rigs from BFL coming in this month (2x 1.5 TH/s units at $30k a pop).
If you haven't already been mining for awhile, its probably too late to really get into nowadays. There's too much competition and you won't make much money at it anymore.
Here's one of my old submissions to reddit just to prove im not full of shit. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 02:14:34
I haven't started mining litecoin yet, but I have 33 GH/s of gpu's on bitcoin  at the moment.
@_date: 2013-03-13 03:00:05
Know of any litecoin pools out there that don't charge a fee?
@_date: 2013-02-08 01:47:21
 is my reply to this nonsense.
@_date: 2013-03-16 01:57:54
Can you make an option for your extension show how many LTC you need to trade for 1 BTC?
@_date: 2013-05-09 07:03:35
I bet a lot of people would look at this and wonder why their 20 dollar bill is mentioning something about a contraceptive with a funny shaped B. (
@_date: 2013-01-11 02:23:31
Well, during June 2011 mining was so ridiculously profitable you could earn your whole investment back in one month. So yes, it was worth it for the time.
@_date: 2013-03-08 13:43:53
I think you'd have better luck asking Kim Jong-un for an AMA. Satoshi has been gone for years now.
@_date: 2013-04-23 09:59:55
So what happens if someone brings down your site via DDOS?
WHAT THEN?
@_date: 2013-06-22 09:34:56
They've shipped only 3 mini-rigs so far.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:28:39
If you put whatever you want to hide in a truecrypt volume and then upload that to dropbox, there's nothing they can do.
@_date: 2013-02-05 15:40:39
As an almost 2 year bitcoin veteran, I don't think this would be an effective ad at all.
@_date: 2013-01-10 07:57:05
The same amount of bitcoins will still be generated on a daily basis when ASIC's come out.
So no, I don't see any reason for a price drop. It's becoming harder for miners to affect the price nowadays anyway with the block reward being cut in half and more bitcoins being in circulation nowadays.
@_date: 2013-06-12 02:05:45
I agree, a 5% fee is a little steep.
@_date: 2013-01-11 22:50:50
If these kind of posters went up in every major city around the world, it might really help accelerate bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:59:32
The Butterfly labs part of this is the most believable.
