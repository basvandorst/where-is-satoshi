Ok and so now I've lost $85 on a lost transaction that never confirmed and got cancelled. Thanks bitcoin, you're too slow to be a viable currency anymore. Bitcoin is officially unsustainable and unusable.

Confirmations are not instant. I'm still waiting on a single confirmation after an hour now and I only get 3 hrs to pay before the order is cancelled. This isn't exactly ideal. Note: I'm using GreenAddress.

3 hours passed already, transaction failed. This is becoming a real problem.

Also, I was referring to the block size not the size of the whole blockchain. According to this video the size limit is 1MB. Trying to catch up on what this whole Segwit thing is.

Most vendors only accept BTC right now, I haven't seen a single vendor accepting litecoin lately. This was just an example. Paying more just to send money is obnoxiously absurd and nobody's going to adopt something like that no matter what the rationale.

If your name is any indication, I am guessing it's probably useless trying to convince you otherwise.

That's absurd that you have to pay more just to get your money to send properly. Outrageous in fact. This is not sustainable, nobody is going to use this if they have to pay 5 dollars to pay for something that's 1 dollar.

It's been 2 hours, since I sent a payment and it's still waiting on a single confirmation... I'd hardly call that instant in any context or comparison.
