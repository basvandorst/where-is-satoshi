I should have said nothing and swept up your cheap BTC based on your lack of knowledge!!!

Guys if you are foolish enough to refuse to adapt than you will go the way of the dinosaur. The moment BTC drops to 5k or less, me and many many others are going to take out mortgages out of homes and then some to buy in on the fools dip. Smart men know when the future has arrived. You guys the last ones to buy a cell phone. Many like you use to say people wouldn't use them and here we are. Everyone has a cell phone!!!

BTC is on wall street now for god sakes!!! its going no where but on a conquest. You guys think they did this thinking it would fade away, hell no they do this to hedge their own bets and support their existing financial structure or it would have been gone years ago!!!  they are now co dependent. Get educated and look this stuff up. The chance to close the window has passed.

and the broke back mountain that is the US federal reserve!!! is aware of this and guess what, all other world currecies are pegged to this fiat currency that is busted and everyone in power and wall street knows. They play the role but deep inside needed BTC to arise to help bail their bitch asses out. I have a Doctorate degree so play question me fools. And yes, I have been drinking!!

Trust, anyone who doubts the future of BTC and many other coins are fools to the core. The same people who avoided the apple and Microsoft stock when these first came out. Be a fool and sell to me buddy!!

While your busy questioning BTC also question whether your banks are solvent and your money in fiat is actually worth what you think it is lol. Get educated my friends

BTC is too big to fail and there are oil trades being done in crypto as well as industrial logistics payments in Bytecoin and everyone has noticed how much it has helped. Love watching the rookies question something as big as agriculture!!!

I promise the people pulling out and the ones nay saying are the ones who have seriously never taken a real risk in their lives lol. Go put your money in a bank or something and watch it grow there lol. We will see who comes out on top!!

your local banks will tax you bitch asses

Because of its speed!!!  and lack of middlemen  I can send you cash fast unlike bank, cash gold ect.   Also, I can hold cash here and avoid taxes if I want to (great for divorce too) and above all, The alt coins have much more advanced protocol that can do a lot!!! Look at RVN Ravencoin for instance. Its Overstock.com's baby and they have created a company just for it called TZero. Gives a major advantage to brokers for trading. BTC is the reserve currency to determine its value. This is just the start.

Many of you don't realize that the economy in USA especially was broken back in 2008. Your dollars are worth aprox 73% less than you think. They had to write a blank check and use skimmed pension funds just to pretend they are afloat. This is historic fact!!! Educate yourselves!!
@_date: 2018-08-03 23:44:56
Seriously man, you don't know at all what is happening if that's all your calculating into your equation. You have any idea what the alt coins are up to. They use BTC as reserve currency to depict value but many of them have outstanding use cases!!  Look up Ravencoin Patrick Byrne and Overstock.com if you want to be clued into just a fraction of what the blockchain is doing. BTC is simply the baseline or reserve currency used to trade the higher purpose coins. Its solid large and strong!!! as well as ultra reliable.

outside of Ravencoin as the primary future of stock trading worldwide, check out Smartcash. They have locked into the POS systems in Brazil, 85% of them. Give it 2 years and their smartswipe bracelets and cards will be the only used currencies in latin America. Seriously you guys need to get educated on the advances happening and learn where to place your faith. Or put your money in your local government banks pockets that's fine too. But Smartcash pays you to hold their currency. Like having a debit card that gets a payment every day!!!! No large infrastructure that sucks the life out of your account and these are world wide currencies, not some single country bull shit!!!
