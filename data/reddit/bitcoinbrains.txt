Its actually pretty likely that we see bail-ins in the western world in the next 5 years. Personally I think that its unlikely that they will be big enough to hit insured accounts but its definitely possible.

In fact I recommended Coinbase to several dozen friends while they were running a $75 referral promotion. Only one or two of these friends spent over $100 before Coinbase decided to retroactively change the reward to $10. Then about a month later the decided that they would terminate my account for using it too much. Now I don't even get all those other $10 rewards.  
All well within their terms of service I'm sure but a shady bait and switch none the less.

A very broad, systemic collapse is exactly the kind of thing I'd be worried about when it comes to their reserves. The idea that governments can indefinitely absolve everyone of the consequences of the massive, large poorly understood risks in the system by continuing to expand the monetary base is dangerous and foolish.   
  
Personally I don't believe that our entire system is on the brink or collapse like some do. Ignoring this risk would be very short sighted though.  
  
The risk that I find much more likely is that we see another significant market correction, coinciding with major defaults across credit markets leading to the potential insolvency of several major banks.    
  
I think the most likely reaction to this won't be to dip into FDIC insured amounts. Its likely that the will go after non insured amounts with an aggressive bail in.

The issue is that people don't yet have a healthy fear of losing the money they have in the bank.

I'd say its actually pretty likely that 100% of banks have at least had a "data breach" as this article mentions. Its safe to say that any bank which offers online banking has lost funds due to unauthorised access to these systems.     
  
It's also relevant to note that there have been significantly more bitcoin exchange hacks than have been made general public knowledge.

@_date: 2016-08-27 15:42:26
FDIC is not funded by the government, the are funded by member banks.  
They aim to keep about 2% of their potential obligations on reserve. In the event of a significant systemic failure like we had in 2008, this will obviously not be enough to cover all customer deposits.  
This would leave two options, either the government covers all the losses like last time (bail out) or they go after customer deposits(bail in).  
After 2008, its safe to say that a bail out would be pretty unpopular. Even people who are largely uninformed on these issues thought the banks got a free ride last time.

I can totally relate to this, I've got two ATMs and I've had most of the mining hardware out there at one point or another. So far a large % of bitcoin related products have significantly under-delivered on their promised features or quality.
Even though there is a lot of great, exciting stuff going on in the world of bitcoin we need to remember that a lot of the companies out there working towards lofty goals and making big promises are essentially making things up as they go.
   
Many of the people making these promises have little to no previous business and/or entrepreneurial experience and may be out of their depth. We need to recognize that it's not easy to break new ground and build a business from nothing in an industry where there often are no precedents to follow.   
  
However its important that consumers protect themselves and hold these companies accountable.  Here are a couple things to keep in mind before purchasing a bitcoin related product:  
  
* If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. You aren't going to get a 3 month ROI on that new piece of mining hardware or ATM. 
* Don't pre-order anything. Ever. Crowd-funding is an amazing model that opens a lot of doors to some interesting new products and technologies. However without some oversight, eager bitcoin users are easy pickings for scam artists. The fact is, there is start-up money out there for smart, motivated people with good ideas and a good plan. If a company absolutely must use crowd funding to sustain their development, they should release and alpha or beta version of their product and price it accordingly (ei. Minecraft).
* Even if the company does deliver what they promise, your results from a pre-order are rarely as good as waiting for an in hand product before you place your order. Across the board, at least some delays are almost universal. It's practically impossible to do the math on your ROI in an ecosystem that's changing this quickly if you don't know EXACTLY when you will receive your purchase. On top of that, the second batch of any product has usually been a bit more refined and quite a bit cheaper.   
* Be aware that almost anything you can order comes with a degree of risk. This week's All Star could be next week's Gox. Just look at [Moolah](

Well the main weakness of a Trezor for cold storage is the backup seed.  
It's basically a piece of paper that allows you to recover your bitcoins if you lose your Trezor. If someone were to steal your seed they could steal your bitcoins.   
You could destroy your seed but then you have no backup.   
You could also just rely on keeping that piece of paper safe, however in that case it's not really any better than a paper wallet for safety.  
The Trezor just makes it much easier to safely use/spend them than a paper wallet.

To put this in perspective, can you give us an idea of how difficult/costly/time consuming this was to implement?  
I figure there must be some reason that every exchange doesn't do this.
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:56:13
Yeah hopefully we will get to something like that point one day. Right now there just aren't enough users to support any kind of meaningful capital investment with a small transaction fee.  
I can't speak for the people operating these terminals but I do run a brokerage and ATMs.  
In our circumstances, we use a % based fee because it has to do with moving the corresponding fiat through the tradtional banking system and getting it back into a position to purchase more bitcoins.  
For most of our users, who tend to make relatively small transactions, a % fee ends up being similar to the deposit and trade fees local exchanges charge for most methods.  
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:52:54
A PR release does not equal transparency.  
First and foremost, I'd like to see them prove solvency. This is really important for an exchange of their size and age.  
Second I'd like to see more transparency on their referral program. Right now its somewhere between a poorly functioning mess and an outright scam. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:24:57
We are an established brick and mortar brokerage in Canada. I'd buy your bitcoin by Paypal or Western Union.
@_date: 2014-09-13 16:07:23
This number is huge, here are a couple things to take into account.   
  
Not all trades that happen as a result of LocalBitcoins happen through their platform. Having personally done 100s of trades, I'd estimate that 50-70% of the trades aren't going through their platform. No one is tracking this volume. This may be the real legacy of MTGox. People are choosing not to trust a centralized body with their money. 
On top of that, there are no day traders on local bitcoins, the high spread would make this impossible. There are also no trade bots and no faked volume like some exchanges have.  
  
When you take these things into account, LocalBitcoins may account for a very large percentage of the volume of regular people exchanging their BTC for fiat and vice versa. 
Some people complain about the price of bitcoins on LocalBitcoin, however our average customers from LocalBitcoins and through our ATMs, are usually spending between $60-100. For a purchase of this size, its actually cheaper to pay a slightly higher % rather than paying the deposit fee that most exchanges charge($5-20) plus their % fee.  
Overall I think LocalBitcoins is an amazingly important part of the BTC world.

Read that pastebin. When I first read it I thought it was a bit crazy but after sitting here thinking about it this afternoon I think it may be close to the truth.  
If you add what was saying below then its possible that they are trading on their own exchange to give the impression that they remain the  exchange in Canada in order to give them a foothold with regulators.  
@_date: 2014-09-14 02:27:49
Yeah the systems that we have in place to exchange fiat to BTC are still very inefficient. These will get better as adoption grows.  
  
In terms of disrupting Western Union, what those guys don't tell you up front is that they take an up front fee to send money as well as a spread on the exchange rate.  
We did a small case study with one of the employees in the coffee shop we inhabit. Sending $50 from Canada to the Philippines by WU cost $52 and got the recipient $44 worth of PHP in their account.  
Using Coins.ph with bitcoins purchased from our shop, it cost $50 and gave the recipient $47 worth.  
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:45:12
ATM operator/brokerage here, there are a couple reasons why I can see this happening, maybe I can give you a little insight.  
  
The biggest challenge in running a BTM or any kind of bitcoin brokerage is managing the fiat side of the business. The bitcoin side of the transaction is nearly frictionless. However once someone buys bitcoins from this machine someone will have to collect the corresponding cash and put it into the bank. From there it will have to be transferred to the exchange of your choice. This transfer can take anywhere from 3-10 days, depending on your location, choice of exchange and luck.   
This means you may need as much as 10x your daily transaction volume in a float just to account for fiat processing times, this is something many people underestimate when purchasing an ATM.   
  
Another reason why this machine could be dry is that the Lamassu backend only supports auto purchasing on a few exchanges. I'm sure this will get better as time goes by.  
  
It's also possible that the operator has chosen to limit the maximum total BTC available to the machine as a security measure and just hasn't topped this up yet.
  
Just to be clear, I don't operate this particular ATM. I do have two on the other side of the world however.  
@_date: 2014-10-15 07:49:38
I've got a Lamassu. I've got to say, the quality of the hardware and their customer support are top notch.  
Their software isn't exactly user-friendly or feature packed but it is getting better and at least its open source so users can improve upon it.

Another BitAccess operator weighing in.  
Overall we are pretty happy with our machine. This is brand new technology and so it hasn't been without a few speed bumps. The responsive, personal service that we've received from BitAccess has certain gone a long way. I can also say that the quality and stability of the software continues to improve.  
  
I want to make it very clear for anyone thinking of buying a BitAccess or any other bitcoin ATM, these are not magic money making machines.   
If you expect to buy a $15000 BTM and put it in a pub or coffee shop and make $50000 in your first year, you're gonna have a bad time.  
  
On top of the many significant hurdles and risks involved in setting up this kind of business, you can't expect to automatically mirror the success of the first ATMs that have been launched in major markets.  
  
It's definitely possible to make a profit with a bitcoin ATM, however its far from guaranteed. If you want to get rich quick or make an easy buck then try the casino. If you want to take a risk and open a business that's totally outside the box for most people then a bitcoin ATM might be worth looking into.

I definitely recommend you give Mintpal a try. It's the nicest exchange out there right now.
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:41:19
These stats are for bitcoins that go through their escrow system. The actual volume is likely 2-3x higher than this.

Maybe they use a secret underground vault that can only be opened in moonlight by a virgin.
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:03:19
The price of bitcoin isn't as important for most companies as the utility.   
Some companies might need to hold a certain amount of bitcoins for whatever their day to day operations are but speculating on the price of bitcoin won't be a part of most companies plans.  
That said, I've spoken with a ton of people from various companies in the industry, many of whom are paid significant salaries from VC money. Pretty much everyone involved is personally holding a decent number of BTC.

There's a lesson here... 
Listen to your customers.
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:58:27
Taking your money out of the control of the banks in the form of bitcoin means footing the bills for storing and moving your funds when fees are present.   
With more adoption we can get the cost of buying/selling/storing bitcoin down significantly though I expect.

@_date: 2014-09-20 00:10:28
Yeah international exchanges definitely aren't any easier. Canada needs something like Coinbase that will just make it as easy as possible.  
Right now the easiest way is through LocalBitcoins or one of the many ATMs. They charge a higher % fee but once you include the deposit fee of $5-20 you pay for most methods on most exchanges and its actually cheaper to pay the higher % on a small amount.  
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:53:44

Check out betarigs.com.  
There you can rent out a miner of pretty much any size for anywhere from 3 hours to a whole week.  
You also pay quite a bit less pre gh/s than you do on cex.io.  
From there you can point it at the pool of your choosing and get a taste of mining without having to make a big commitment.

Yeah I just threw this up, they haven't added a link to it yet.  
So far they've received about $12,000.00 in bitcoin donations.

We are helping a local charity try out Lighthouse.  
They've been accepting bitcoin donations for a few months now with great success.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:03:59
I think Lighthouse is a pretty neat idea. The big difference is that the donations only go through once the project is fully funded.
On top of that, donors have the ability to leave a name and/or email to get a tax receipt.
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:19:11
Sounds like the next Robocoin. Glad I didn't order one.  
@_date: 2014-09-20 05:48:02
Yeah if you are with one of the banks that allows Interac transfers then its a pretty good way to go.  
For an experienced user looking to put in medium sized amounts ($200-5000) at a time its definitely the cheapest way to go.  
For someone new who is looking to put in a small amount the overall difference might be a buck or two, if that. A lot of the time people would rather meet someone in person who can explain some basics to them.  
On the other side of the fence, if someone is looking to get a large amount. Getting an experienced broker to source the BTC will often be cheaper than it would be just buying on the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:21:55
Anyone in particular that you think is missing?   
Canada is a big country and I'm constantly surprised at how many companies are out there doing interesting things.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:21:38
Replied by PM but I'll leave some info here in case others need it.  
In Canada there are the following options for processing donations:  
  
1. CAVIRTEX allows you to create invoices for potential donors. The main downside to this system is that the invoice only lasts 15 minutes from when it is created.   
They also allow you to create a donation button on a webpage. It [looks like this](  
Either of these systems allows you to require the donor to fill out their personal information.  
They also have a [web-based POS app]( which could work well for taking donations at events.  This system collects no customer information. 
Fees are 0% for the first $100,000 and 0.5% thereafter. 
  
1. Bitpay offers a similar set of services. The main differences are that they offer a bit more customization when it comes to collecting donor information and setting donation limits.  
Their donation page [looks like this](  
They also make it a bit easier to share your donation campaign on Facebook and Twitter.  
Their POS app is mobile based rather than web-based.  
Their basic account is free. Fees apply if you want extras like Quickbooks integration.  
  
1. QuadrigaCX also has a couple options. The simplest way to use their system is to set up an auto-sell address. The downside is that you only get one address for everyone.  
They also have a web-based merchant POS system, it [looks like this](  
Fees are set at 1%.  
1. Another really simple option that I've seen used recent is [Coinwidget]( It's basically just a super simple little button  for accepting donations.  
It [looks like this](  
This could be used with the auto-sell feature on QuadrigaCX or manually cashed in on the exchange of your choice.   
   
I run a [brick and mortar bitcoin store]( in Calgary. Feel free to contact me if you need any help setting up any of these systems or have any questions.  
  
Some of the links I posted as examples are for my own merchant accounts. Please don't send me any money but feel free to donate to the charities that I used for examples.

There is no margin trading on that contract yet.

@_date: 2017-03-20 14:24:08
Surely putting your transaction directly on the world's most secure decentralized ledger has value that would continue to keep fees healthy even in the presence of additional layers.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:57:22
Yeah I can agree that it isn't 100% clear that XT should have been referred to as an altcoin. I think many take issue with the arbitrary super majority of 75% that was picked along with the fact that it does not address the need for an economic consensus whatsoever.   
In terms of motivations, I'd guess your take might be right when it comes to Gavin but given Mike's other actions(my previous points A and C), I think its reasonable to conclude that his motivations may have been nefarious. 
 
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:51:27
Tokens on a chain which cannot be spent or cashed in for other currency aren't really very likely to be highly prized by miners or holders.

Good to hear from the economically relevant.  
If larger bitcoin businesses like Coinbase and Bitpay had the spine to take this kind of stand then this hardfork would be dead before it ever splits.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:08:58
At some point, the "economic nodes" do have to take a side or no resolution will be possible.  
It could be argued that Coinbase might represent the single most important economic node.  
If Coinbase came out against the miner controlled, closed source, broken implementation that we currently see gathering support then it might go a long way towards avoiding a hard fork and safeguarding the entire ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-03-28 02:56:35
We feel that too many economically relevant companies have been taking the position that they will wait and see what the consensus ends up being.  
This statement is a reflection of what we believe consensus should be  and our attempt to contribute to the discussion with the goal of getting there.  
  
Whether you think our opinions matter is up to you.

He did say he was new. Not every issue is black and white and not every nuance of every issue is obvious to everyone.
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:10:18
The "consensus of the community" is not formed by a forum posts.  
It's formed by the actual users of bitcoin and the services that they use.  
  
As is very fond of saying, Bitcoin is valuable because it is rare and useful.   
A coin that could not easily be exchanged for fiat and could not be spent on goods and services would not be very useful, regardless of how many transactions per second it can handle.  
  
This is why the economic nodes are relevant.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:18:10
More likely that Mike Hearn has been paid to bring down bitcoin.  
Theymos' position has not been popular but it has been consistent.  
  
Mike on the other hand has a record of:  
A) Attempting to undermine the fungibility of bitcoin  
B) Releasing a competing altcoin in an attempt to centralize ownership of full nodes  
C) Taking a job with a bank
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:04:19
I really appreciate the thoughtful responses.  
  
For many people in this subreddit, Roger Ver seems to have become some sort of inhuman boogeyman who personifies every threat people imagine to the hope bitcoin has given them. Its nice to see the other side as well.  
  
Have you specifically spoken with Roger about the recent technical problems BU seems to be having?  
It seems to me that given the frequency and severity of these problems, maintaining that BU is anywhere close to being a functional piece of software is not a position that a rational person acting in the best interests of bitcoin could take. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 01:01:19
As private companies we are free to decide whether we will accept or support bitcoin, BTU or any other currency.

Well the halvening is not a secret, therefore its possible that the effects of the change in supply will be priced in by the market before the change.  
Bitcoin is a volatile asset with poor liquidity and nearly no oversight on the trading side. Anyone who tells you they know what will happen to the price in the future is either lying or stupid.

They will definitely reverse transactions that happen from hacked accounts. Its a very common scam attempt.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:34:26
Why, they are basically a bank right now.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:50:39
They hold your money and do who knows what with it. They decide what transactions are valid and who can have an account.   
Sounds pretty bankish to me.
@_date: 2016-11-02 21:26:01
Yeah we've run an OTC brokerage in Canada since 2013.   
  
In that time we've managed to only have one transaction of this kind reversed and we had luckily not sent any BTC because some facts weren't adding up at the time.  
  
I know a number of local bitcoins sellers who have had issues over the years. One guy even got arrested when he walked into his bank to try to pull out 15k in cash after the transaction which provided him that 15k had just been reversed. The bank assumed he was the one trying to scam them.  
  
Currently most people selling BTC for EMTs in Canada keep themselves protected from fraud by keeping transaction limits low and using some kind of ID verification like a skype chat.
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:51:30

4.5 million of those accounts have probably been suspended for suspicious activity.
@_date: 2016-11-02 20:03:34
This is definitely not true. They will reverse it if the buyer was using a  hacked account to buy the bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-08-21 00:29:10
Yup, definitely better to hold your own coins.
@_date: 2015-08-21 07:49:11

You're making the mistake of thinking you have 2.0 bitcoins in a coinbase account.  
What you really have is an IOU from coinbase for 2.0 bitcoins.

They actually had higher BTC volume than that a bunch of times in Nov-Dec 2013. Also the price was way higher so the actual CAD being traded was considerably higher.

@_date: 2017-04-07 14:41:17
That's true. My point is that Sam Cole estimated that they have an advantage greater than that which would be conferred with free power, which AB is not.
If he's right then there might still be another hidden advantage or a reason other than profit that they'd like to control this much hardware.
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:01:07
Bandwidth is actually a much bigger problem for home nodes than disk space.   
At my old place I was constantly getting hassled by my ISP because my node was using 120gb/month of upstream.  
This can be managed somewhat by limiting the number of connections your node allows but realistically, having a bunch of nodes that aren't very well connected isn't good for the security of the network either.   
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:31:22
ASICBOOST means less power usage, which would no longer be a significant advantage if power were free. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 13:26:13
Lucrative is all relative.  
That 1% can't possibly come close to being enough revenue for a large, VC backed multinational corporation.  
If we ever reach this "mass adoption" point that all the big-block-Koolaid types seem to have embraced as the eventual goal for bitcoin, then 1% fees will no longer be sustainable.

Unfortunately most of these are not true for worldwide gold markets.
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:31:43

Coinbase would like to keep all bitcoin related transactions either on the blockchain or moving through their ecosystem.   
Farming this information and then selling to the highest bidder is likely their real business model.    
Its basically impossible that their current consumer facing business model is profitable and I doubt they ever expect it to be.   
Sidechains, LN or confidential transactions are all potentially very damaging to this plan.

Who cares about on-chain coffee as long as fees are low enough to support on-chain pizza then we are fine.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:25:47
That's true but unless they made two separate runs of boards that wouldn't be the case as we know they are shipping hardware without AB enabled to average users.
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:46:06
Yes but this comment specifically mentions that according to his math, even with free power, Sam Cole cannot figure out how the Chinese can make a profit unless they have a secret advantage.  
Because the advantage created by AB is specifically relevant to power, this means that either his math was wrong or this isn't the advantage they would have needed.  
Basically his prediction is irrelevant to the current situation.  
@_date: 2017-04-17 16:13:47

After talking to hundreds of regular bitcoin users in person over the last few months, I'd place the don't know/don't care number at somewhere around 80%.  
Among users who did know and care, I've only found 2 people who didn't specifically support Segwit and neither of them were specifically in favour of BU.  
@_date: 2016-02-08 06:20:25
Got any examples of this?
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:28:36
That's true but if they had free power they'd already be in that position and ASICBOOST wouldn't help any more.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:56:58
If this is blocked will the end result for the miners using this be decreased hashing power or increased power consumption?

@_date: 2017-09-06 16:15:19
I guess my point is that they aren't making sound business decisions as I don't believe that seeking profits from transaction volume is their goal. They are simply racking up the stats for the next VC round of greater fools.  
    
I'm basing this on many years of interaction with Coinbase, their employees along with other companies in the space. I believe this view is supported by the constant stream of anecdotes and complaints about Coinbase that hit every forum in the space.
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:56:05
Coinbase inflates these stats so that they look good for their next VC round.  
The vast majority of these "users" have either had their account frozen for touching coins that someone gambled with a few months ago or they have never been able to successfully link a bank account or make a purchase.

For the last two years we've been running a brick and mortar bitcoin store and OTC brokerage.  
  
Over the last 3-4 months I've noticed more people than ever are coming in to buy bitcoins to help them solve real world problems.  
  
2 years ago 99% of the people buying bitcoins from me were doing so for speculation on the price.
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:31:05
Saying that it's the majority of users may be hyperbolic.  
  
Then again, it's not entire far fetched. I've personally spoken with hundreds of "users" who have failed to make a purchase on Coinbase and these kinds of stories are very common on this subreddit.  
  
Their focus is clearly on adding more users rather than offering service to the ones that the have.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:29:41
Yup, we've been around as an official brick and mortar store for a little under two years. I was selling on local bitcoins for about a year before that.

Mostly just anecdotal. I speak with most of my customers personally about how they are using bitcoin though so I have a pretty good handle on it.  
  
Without giving specific number however, I can tell you that from a year ago, our number of customers and transactions is way up and our average transaction value is down.

Clearly a lot of value comes out of the world's post secondary education systems, both for individuals that attend them and for society as a whole.  
However what has changed, is that college/university is no longer automatically the best choice for every smart, driven, accomplished young person coming out of high school.  
In the US the for-profit education/loan system has sapped the value  for the student out of the arrangement. Many of the doctors you mentioned will be living like paupers to make loan payments well into their 40s.  
The US is the extreme example, but around the world employers have realized that hiring a college graduate no longer means that you are hiring the best and the brightest like it did 40 years ago. At best it means you are hiring someone who can follow directions and stick with something.  
I expect that over the next decade, as decentralized systems continue to grow and expand into people's everyday lives, people will become more and more comfortable challenging old paradigms.   
I have a 4 month old son, I wouldn't say I'm saving for his education. I'd say I'm saving for his future, whatever that may be.

Here are the issues with Bitclub:  
  
1. Bitclub is a cloud mining company. When you invest in cloud mining, it can be difficult or impossible to tell if your payouts are coming from legitimate mining income or from the buy-ins of new customers(thereby making it a Ponzi scheme).  
  
2. Bitclub is structured as an MLM company. Whatever you think of MLM companies, in most cases they sell a tangible product. If the people buying these products are happy with their purchases then no one really got ripped off. In this case the product is the promise of future profits. Bitclub spends around 40% of their mining income on sales and promotions(like the meeting you attended). This is crucial to the MLM model. The reason this works for most MLM companies is because they sell products with +90% margins. In bitcoin mining the margins are much lower, usually &lt;5%. Its simply impossible to make a profit without that 40%.  
  
I've spoken at length with a few of these people and even attended one of their meeting and they are really very good at deflecting attention away from these simple facts.   
  
The only way that you have a chance to make a profit in dollars from an investment in Bitclub is if the price of Bitcoin goes up enough to offset your losses from the mining scam. It is 100% guaranteed to be a worse investment than simply buying and holding bitcoin.

Given that it seems like basically no real economic activity is taking place in any alts, IMO it would be best to focus on what metrics are tied to the speculation.

There are definitely a lot of bitcoin users and holders among the owners and employees of bitcoin companies. However I don't really agree that increased individual use will drive the price up.  
The velocity that's possible with bitcoin means that you don't have to hold it very long in order to use it.

From the start the business model at Coinbase has been to acquire users and worry about making money later. Or more likely, sell the company/userbase to someone else who can worry about that.

I'll buy it from you.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:34:35
Sure I don't mind helping.  
1. What your referencing here is called bitcoin mining. Essentially you are using your computer to maintain a giant ledger of every bitcoin transaction going on.  
The time when you could make a significant profit at this with a regular desktop computer has passed, now its all done on specialized hardware built solely for that function.  
Some people still do it on less powerful machines, in spite of the very small rewards, because keeping a widespread base of miners keeps the network as a whole decentralized and healthy.  
2. Its true that a lot of people are getting into bitcoin these days based on speculation. The price has gone up a lot lately after-all.   
However the real strength of bitcoin lies in the tremendous utility that it brings to merchants and consumers.  
From the point of view of a merchant, they can eliminate or greatly reduce the fees that they pay on credit card/paypal transactions.
It also eliminates the risk of charge-backs and greatly reduces the risk of fraud affecting the merchant.   
From the point of view of a consumer, it allows you to truly control your own money. There is no 3rd party deciding when/where/how and how much of your own money you should be allowed to spend.  
Even if this has never happened to you, most people know someone who has had their credit card or paypal account frozen because they took a trip and didn't notify them or purchased something that didn't match their habits.  
Since we opened the store, literally every single day, at least one person has had to call their bank because they had an unexpected limit on their daily debit transactions that they did not know was there.  
With bitcoin you control your own money. No one can tell you how to use it.  
It also allows consumers to connect directly with service providers all over the world and pay them quickly and directly with almost no fees.  
In fact we were able to hire a guy from South Africa to design our logo. Once he had completed the work and sent me a proof, the payment was in his wallet within minutes.  
That has to be the biggest wall of text I've ever contributed on here.  
If you want to learn more, feel free to come into the store and we can talk some more.
