I guess the one from aliexpress for 150£ will have to do the job :D

If the sat value is too low and the transaction is not confirmed in the matter of two weeks, the transaction fails and your bitcoin goes back to your cex.io account.

Looks great! which laser engraver did you use? in case you made it yourself.

Thanks for the link. That one looks expensive. I was thinking of getting one on aliexpress to engrave private keys onto small metal slabs for cold storage.

That's a great tip! I'll change the name. Thanks

what do you mean with risk-on and risk-off asset?
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:39:11
it's not about negating the debt of the US but about finding ways to escape a failing economy. This national debt can not go on forever, the US dollar will increasingly lose its value as inflation goes up, prices of goods go up as the economy tumbles. These are all signs of an upcoming financial crisis.

No. If you short the market you sell high with leverage and buy back low.

Cheapest is bity.com though only accepts bank transfers. However they also accept CHF so no exchange rate fees

I didn't know those two. I will try them out. Thanks

start reading up on technical analysis. tradingview.com has good charts and people post their trading ideas. It is a good beginning.

First of all it is great to take initiative. I would really like to see the other part of the video where you have them talking about bitcoin and their opinion on blockchain. I feel like it would be more informative and more popular in the community. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose

i suggest next time you ask the people for their opinion instead of just having them say the same sentence over an over again. Talking to people around the world about bitcoin and documenting it is a good idea. Having everyone just shout "go team bitcoin" is poor execution. Good luck on the next video

Thanks for the information. I didn't know that. I'll check it out.
