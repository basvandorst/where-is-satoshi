you seem to have missed the small text

It has as much predictive power as a best fit line for climate data. Sure, you can have "90%" fit but that is literally meaningless for predictions.
This chart is directly misleading in many ways. You even claim it goes "all the way to Genesis Block" when the chart itself clearly shows that it starts at around \~10\^2.75 days after genesis block.
"PhD in physics and all the grad classes for a master in math" is pretty meaningless, especially on reddit. You can't just claim to be an expert in order to supply verification that the information you have provided is correct. Even if what you say is true, I would much rather talk to a statistician or a data scientist over a physics or math major.
I've taken data science and I tend to be pretty decent at it. From what I've seen of this thread, you either haven't taken any data science courses or you're absolutely terrible at it. Not only are you bad at applying basic concepts, you're terrible at explaining them as well.
Finally, this looks like all you've done is a bad application of a ~~lin-log~~ (EDIT: oh my, I'm so sorry I read this terrible chart wrong, apparently it's log-log and according to this means that the model is much more profound and if you disagree then you don't understand math or physics) model and graphed it, likely with approximately 2-3 functions in R. It is low effort and doesn't provide any meaningful data.

One would think that you would get the point when literally everyone in the comment section is either joking about your post or telling you that it means little.   
But I guess the rest of us clearly just aren't educated enough....
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:54:21
Jesus dude, you're retarded.
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:22:15
I mean, I pretty clearly understand just fine what you mean. Logarithms and exponents are taught in grade 10 where I come from, and it's generally around that time that you learn how to use excel to fit a trend line. You can see this trend line by setting your chart to display log-lin. Extrapolating a best fit line on that is easy. You're making this out to be way more work than it actually is.
If you do data science for a living, how do you survive? I wouldn't pay you for this.
Literally, you can make the exact same chart you've posted here with about 2 lines of R code. And if that doesn't say that I understand what you've done here, then I think you're clueless.
Also, being diminutive and constantly bringing up your "credentials" is not a great way to win an argument on reddit.
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:47:59
How is me stating that identifying a trend line isn't profound trolling? It's a superbly low effort post. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:58:51


\- OP, 2018
Seriously though, this isn't how statistical tests/results work. Even if you've found a good model (which this isn't), a good model doesn't mean you can predict anything outside of the data you have. All it means is that the model you've found is a good predictor for the data you have.  
This is pretty basic statistics and I'm calling out for bullshit. Literally a first year stats class would teach you this.
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:29:37
This isn't statistics, though. You've fit a trend line over log-linear data.
No, entire industries are not based on these predictions. Yes, science and past data is used for extrapolation, but not in this idiotic way. This doesn't have any predictive value beyond saying "Look, it's going up!". Sure, it shows a general trend - that is very VERY obvious if you've ever looked at any stock market data before. And no, I don't give a shit about your Ted Talk explaining the wonders of the power law. Read my comments. I very clearly understand what the power law implies. You clearly do not understand the limitations of the mathematics you are attempting to use. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:57:07
I don't really see how I've attacked him. If he's going to make wild claims then he should be able to defend them using reason, rather than stating that he has a PhD in physics and has taken math classes.
Throughout our discussion he would only insinuate that either I hadn't read or hadn't understood what he was saying, but I did quite well. What he has actually said on the matter reads like he has little understanding of statistics, but he claims to be well learned in the subject. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:32:31
Yes, I did both of those things, about an hour after I learnt how to use [ It's not challenging in any way. Plotting stocks on log-linear graphs has been done for as long as there has been a stock market.
I guess clearly I don't understand physics and math, simply because I don't believe this is profound (spoiler: it's not).
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:42:04
No, I don't think log-linear and log-log are the same thing. I think that your analysis here is pretty simple and not in any way as profound as you think it is.
I understand all of what you've said and more - but what you seem to fail to get is that *I disagree with your opinion.*
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:51:46
dumb ass I know what power laws are and I know what you're trying to say, I just don't care and I think it means little, because it does. Just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean I have no clue what I'm talking about
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:05:42
Sure, I did say that over and over, just as he claimed that myself and the other commentators that didn't explicitly agree with him didn't have a grasp of math or physics (which remember, he apparently has a PhD in).
Claiming that a trend line has predictive power is pretty disingenuous and would be laughed out even in a basic statistics class. It has descriptive properties, not predictive.
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:43:25
Okay, well I see thinks that somehow this is insightful. 
It really isn't. Like really really isn't. I dunno why you would think it is.
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:04:42
I'm not saying you're wrong, just saying that it's not important in any way. You've identified a positive trend line of a deflationary asset - not exactly cutting edge.
I haven't been trolling you, you just are incapable of taking criticism, which is clear to see from all of your comments.
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:56:04
Log-linear and log-log are not completely different beasts, lol. And the difference doesn't change anything I've said.
Your graph is bad, your thinking is incorrect, and nothing you've done here has been profound in any way. You can go ahead and keep smelling your own farts for all I care, but this isn't going to make you successful.
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:00:11
Yes, you are the only stupid thing here, that is the first correct thing you've said.

Hahaha, it took them three months to read and respond to my emails about my verification process. Three months for me to even be able to purchase bitcoin from them. In that time, the price went from $750 to $1000 CAD

What? This isn't a miner, it is a node: 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:03:18
What? Miners and nodes are separate. Nodes host a full copy of the blockchain to be distributed to end users. Miners do the work required to keep the network secure.
Hosting a bitcoin node earns no profit.

You're the one who sounds more like a kid. This is it's full of forex traders. USD is the short name of the currency, just like CAD - just like forex pairs are in the form USDCAD or EURJPY. Somewhat similar to BTCUSD?
What's the reason to be such a toxic person?

So I looked through those transactions, and it looks to me like it's some sort of tumbling operation, eventually culminating in all coins leading to these three addresses:
3JEyFvp9NEfBuTrdffVRekafUNCmAFgus4 (balance: 170 BTC)
3B3M59ZpE32Ty4htbc6szwkHmb6T72Ntzq (balance: 236 BTC)
3A4U175prUGEn3B1gUDkz32u8fnF9Nx3Ly (balance: 220 BTC)
@_date: 2017-04-18 03:35:06
I wouldn't mind proof of your claim.
@_date: 2017-04-14 02:46:47
Well, that certainly could be malicious, but to me it just looks like normal coin tumbling, albeit a very large amount. Using many accounts in a transaction definitely massively increases the size of the TX, so... I agree the past six months at the very least have been very suspicious in terms of a number of things - mempool size being one of them. I think Bitcoin may be in store for a shock soon.
