This is what the world economy looks like today featuring cryptocurrencies. Do you see that little slice between Switzerland and Argentina? That’s crypto, and it’s already 35x larger than it was at Jan 1st, 2017. It’s not a big slice, but it’s visible now which is a pretty big accomplishment in and of itself.

Keep this chart and compare it within couple of days. You're low quality. Be optimistic.. the future is moving ahead. Keep sleeping... we on the other hand grow.

You guys should open up Dogecoin Donation for this kind of donations and leave BTC to grow. Use other cryptocurrency. Thats my opinion...
Cheaper and it will reduce the micro payments go through easier.. help grow all cryptos not only BTC... Which it moves 300-800 dollars spikes and dips. Too much drama...

The video... and who cares about daily price. Buy and hold check in 30 days... if ur depending on bitcoin to go up tomorrow... then this is not for u. This isnt forex... good luck to u
Trading Bitcoin is a long term. Short term trade other crypto for less drama and make better higher %
