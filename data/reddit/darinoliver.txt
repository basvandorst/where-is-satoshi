Yeah...that my view...I cant say whats driving it but there are way too many negative divergences...you have to be patient...if you really believe in the rally you should be long ETH because eventually there will be reversion to the mean...that said...I dont advise that either...I am just saying that if you are a bitcoin bull you cant ignore the obvious fact that its breaking away from its correlation to the minors and that is probably not sustainable....all these coins are highly correlated in the medium term, they are essentially replacements for each other...so if one gets too far out of wack the others need to rise or the one out of wack need to fall...something has to give...Bitcoin isnt that much better and you cant argue that a lot of Bitcoin doesn't end up in ETH ICOs either...

Let's see  - the internet goes down from an EMP - and, opps...how good is that Bitcoin now?

Compare ETH for example to Bitcoin...there you see hash rates exploding (above the daily average) and address (unique wallets) is expanding nicely....but prices are not rising...that the sort of positive divergence you want to see to lead you to be a buyer...
 
Monday was  record!
Monday was a record -
So I am buying this dip today in ETH...but to be honsst...the fake bitcoin rally scares me...because if BTC takes a hit...ETH will fall...so I am being very careful here...its inflection point trading...in and out quicky...if ETH starts to sell of oddly I am out..
I suspect you are seeing one of the recent big ICOs selling into this - which is being mostly absorbed by new buyers....but not enough to drive prices higher...but once their selling is over, prices should rise given the other factors...that is, assuming there isn't a sudden crash in BTC!

I am a massive Bitcoin bull, but there are way too many divergences setting up here, the price is rising BUT: a)  USD transaction volume is falling b)  confirmed are not rising with rising prices and c) probably the most important is that Number Of Unique Addresses Used 
 is nowhere near the old highs - put it all together and you have some very aggressive buyers pushing prices higher for speculative reasons but not enough real long term buyers underneath to support the price rises...Finally if these Bitcoin only factors were not enough, you are not seeing the same price action in ETH or Ripple...normally these are highly correlated (and the reason you are not seeing it is that it's not a real new buyer rally, its traders rally not sported by real buying).   The under current in Cyrpot is new buyers....and we are just not seeing that right now...its way to artificial and it will correct significantly...

This is not correct for tax - for tax its usually where your revenue comes from or where your actaul business is operasting from and sometimes (but less and less) the domicile of the company.  In theory a non-resident can use a US LLC to do business outside the US and not have any US customers or other connection to the US, in this case if he was not a US citizen he wouldnt even need to file a return.   That said, if you are using a US server and conucting crimninal activity which its pretty clesr they were, then this does open a door...even if its a CDN.

Interesting it was the Northern District of CA, an Obama appointment - not that it doesn't also look like these were bad guys (claims ransomware too), but for anyone who thinks the US cannot touch you if you are outside the US and do not even trade in the US you are wrong...the key way they reach is through USD transactions...they should have stuck with EUR

I would like to see a bonafide citation for this....because if he is not selling a product to US customers I am skeptical the location of the servers matters under US tax code.  I think the question is who are the customers and where are they located and where is the decision making being done...a server doesn't make decisions on corporate matters.  This said, I would never run a business like this if it had US servers...but that's not so easy anymore...cloud systems are everywhere...CDN is running through servers nearest the customers (which may include the US if you have Canadian customers)...etc...given this, I think if the IRS tried to enforce a tax on a business operating outside the US, with no US customers, I think that would not stand up to legal scrutiny...but show me a case to read, I am curious...

This is actually true and not well known...in the indictment they can say whatever they want...it doesn’t have to be true, but that said, it likely a large part is true...look at the legal structure...Cyprus, Seychelles on top (one of few jurisdictions where you can still really truly hide identities since they don’t have international treaties) plus the connection to Mt Gox...it just smells like a bad fish to me...

The war is coming, but I disagree with you on the "narrative" issue - in other places I have noted I expected some prosecutor trying to make a name would jump into this, but a crime needed to be committed - these guys were shady with a capital S...But what gives the US the ability to charge someone for a crime in the US was their use of the USD and use of US servers...always best to stay away from these when possible if you are doing shady things like they were...even when using AWS, they could have used cloud services outside the US...as for Cloudfare, that's a reach given nothing is hosted there IMHO, but it nonetheless left another door open...still if it's true they were facilitating the transfer of stolen money....shouldn't we all be happy?
