It makes me sad that crypto idea, which should be a symbole of good change, was used in Venezuela in such a bad way  
I've read an article about it on [BlockChain24.co]( author has an interesting point of view on this situation.

You can try [BuyCoinNow.com]( .This is the online "cantor" where you can purchase btc using your debit/credit card. Registration is needed, but it's safe because of that. I recommend you to invest in the cold storage.
@_date: 2019-11-04 10:48:39
I'm pretty sure that they buy BTC. 
btw, don't like Coinbase to be honest.... Now I use CoinDeal and this is more reliable exchange to me.
@_date: 2019-11-18 07:56:20
It depends where you live, South or North Korea? As far as I know CoinDeal is available in South Korea so you can use this exchange. Very professional, never had any problems with that platform.
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:22:14
I'm not sure if buying cryptocurrencies without any verification is safe. It sounds like scam, so watch out. Better ask any adult for help (maybe your parents?) and purchase bitcoin only in the reliable websites. You can use one of the crypto exchanges or an online cantor (something like  [ ).
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:11:44
dude, better just check CoinDeal, they have already launched their app ( [ very reliable one imo, deposits in some currencies are even free of charge
@_date: 2019-11-12 17:58:33
What about CoinDeal? As far as I know it's available in Singapore. Very nice platform with many markets and payment methods (for example: Skrill, E-pay, Visa). Fees are attractive imo, deposits in some currencies are free of charge.
@_date: 2019-11-17 13:10:14
Use one of the cryptocurrency exchanges, that's probably the safest way of buying Bitcoin. For example CoinDeal accepts Visa, but you can also use many different payment options like E-pay or Skrill. Fees are definitely lower than in the online crypto cantors.
@_date: 2019-11-13 07:58:30
well, I've been using it for a long time and everything is okay. check out their security standards, they have SSL, mandatory 2FA, CloudFlare and SwissSign protection and many many others

how about CoinDeal? This crypto exchange is one of my favourite platforms. Very reliable, it has the highest security standards like SSL, CloudFlare and SwissSign protection.
@_date: 2019-11-07 14:31:04
Definitely CoinDeal. Their biggest superiority to me is safety. Fees are okay and what's more - deposits in some currencies are free of charge (also in GBP). You can use various paying methods (for example Skrill, E-pay) and they have a wide range of markets. If you register now, you can get some free CDL Tokens (as a user) for free, their market starts 12 of November.

@_date: 2019-10-14 07:43:30
Check out [coindeal.com]( very reliable exchange to me. They have quite attractive fees, just read the info on their website. CoinDeal's priority is users' safety which is their biggest superiority to me. Safety first.
@_date: 2019-10-28 07:23:41
 [ :) It's the online cantor where you can buy btc with your credit or debit card. Very simple and quick, but you have to register.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:09:34
Try [coindeal.com]( :) as far as I know it's available in India. I consider it as a reliable exchange, quite young but fast-developing. Deposits in some currencies are free of charge which is big superiority for users.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:16:34
Try [buycoinnow.com]( a worldwide platform focused on selling BTC, verification lasts no longer than 24 hours and ins't complicated. Also fees are low, it is like 7% now, so comparing to others sites is a good result
@_date: 2019-10-15 11:50:43
Cash app is quite complicated sometimes. When CoinDeal finally do its app, I'll be using it. I'm pretty sure that CoinDeal's app will be easier than this :P
@_date: 2019-10-17 10:34:10
In my opinion, you should buy Bitcoin. Mining isn't so profitable because of the high electricity costs. Buying is so easy in today's world, I recommend you to use one of the cryptocurrency exchanges, for example CoinDeal. Crypto exchanges have a really nice fees so this is the most profitable way in my opinion. Bitcoin's price won't be as high as in 2017 but it doesn't mean that it's not worth to buy it now.
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:24:31
Be patient and keep every transaction in the history, this could be helpful. Maybe your exchange isn't safe enough? Have you thought about that? I recommend you Kraken or CoinDeal, these two are professional and reliable

interesting interview, a lot of useful information. good to see people like Alex who care about cryptocurrency market these days
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:33:44

As somebody said here before, CoinDeal will be a great choice. This is very professional, fast-developing exchange. Their variety of coins and paying methods is impressive. Really like their votings on the next available coins. CoinDeal seems to be very user-friendly and involved in their community.
@_date: 2019-10-31 07:41:06

@_date: 2019-10-21 10:47:26
Now it's a great time to do it. Now - in general, it doesn't matter if you do it today or tomorrow. Just find a proper exchange (I can recommend this one:  [ ) and start buying.
@_date: 2019-10-21 11:10:18
Cash app requires your personal data as far as I know so it's not anonymous. I think that buying Bitcoin anonymously is totally dangerous, do not risk. Try some professional exchanges to purchase btc (KuCoin, CoinDeal etc.)
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:01:51
Better check out CoinDeal. This exchange has really attractive fees imo. Moreover, deposits in EUR,USD or GBP are free of charge.
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:22:21
that's the most common false opinion about cryptocurrencies :/
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:29:49
Interesting.. That's for sure a very good way to attract new traders, especially when CoinDeal is opening on U.S. market right now
@_date: 2019-10-14 07:26:37
Do not trust this kind of exchanges. Verification is important to keep the exchange safe for users. I recommend you to check more reliable exchanges, like for example CoinDeal or Kraken. These two have the higest security standards so your coins, money and personal data are safe. Isn't that important for you?
@_date: 2019-10-21 10:50:33
try  [ this is one of the fastest way of buying BTC I've known. you can do it using your credit or debit card

@_date: 2019-10-09 19:17:35

@_date: 2019-10-14 07:21:33
Exactly, I use BuyCoinNow from time to time and it's very useful platform when you want to buy BTC easily and quickly. Basic website. If you don't want to use an exchange to trade later, use this platform. All you need is your credit or debit card.

I think it's a mistake to compare Libra with other cryptocurrencies - the only similarity between them is blockchain tech and its general function. Whole agenda of Zuckerberg's coin is completely different from idea behind cryptocurrency concept.  
Even in his FB statement about Libra, Zuck have said that main purpose of this coin is "to create a simple global financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people around the world ". So it's obviously aimed in banking system, but it won't work like BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Libra will be more available, cause it will have whole infrastructure of FB and its partners (like Visa or MasterCard, so it's highly possible that you will be able to buy this coin in a seconds, in case of bitcoin such option is available only in services like [buycoinnow.com](  
And one final thing - FB didn't use word "cryptocurrency" even once in context of Libra. But I believe both of them my coexist in peace
@_date: 2019-10-04 09:49:35
Well, just use another and more reliable exchange. Try CoinDeal or Kraken, these two are great. You can buy Bitcoin or any other altcoins there, CoinDeal has a huge variety of coins and paying methods. Deposits via bank transfer are free of charge there so it's a huge superiority. Both platforms are really user-friendly so they are perfect for beginners.
@_date: 2019-10-28 07:27:28
Guys, you seriously believe that these websites are safe? I use only realiable websites, now I buy btc on CoinDeal and registration (and verification) is required there. It makes me feel safe...
@_date: 2019-12-27 07:38:07
Yeah, you can buy btc or eth. Both of them are available on CoinDeal so I recommend that exchange. Mining isn't profitable nowadays, because fo the high electricity cost, better just buy. The problem is that you need to be an adult and have your ID to register and verify anywhere.
@_date: 2019-12-05 11:09:58
hmmm Gold is also promising. In reference to cryptocurrencies, I'm from Poland and many of my friends invest in cryptocurrencies, so cryptocurrencies have been slowly becoming more and more popular there. We've got even polish cryptocurrency exchange called CoinDeal and I need to say that it's great. CoinDeal is well known in EU and it has already entered the US market. So, Poland is also very involved in cryptocurrency world in my opinion.

Try [buycoinnow.com]( , it's the online cryptocurrency cantor where you can buy Bitcoin via credit or debit card. It's probably the fastest platform I've ever used. Quite basic website for traders, everything works fine, fees are okay.
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:04:40
Yes, this is perfect. Buy bitcoin now, because (I believe) that its price will be higher soon. What about keeping it in hardware wallet? This is definitely the safest option
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:42:49
Firstly, you need to find a proper cryptocurrency exchange or find a cryptocurrency cantor. I recommend you to choose an exchange because fees are definitely lower there than in the cantors. Try CoinDeal for example because of its security practices and its low fees. Deposits in some currencies are free of charge. It is not profitable to mine nowadays, because of the high electricity costs.

It's impossible to me to buy bitcoin anonymously and safely at the same time. That's two different issues. Is it really important to you to do it anonymously? To me - safety first. I recommend to use one of realiable sources to buy Bitcoin, like for example Kraken or CoinDeal. The second one is super user-friendly, fees are pretty okay and deposits in some currencies are free of charge.
@_date: 2019-12-13 11:44:42
Better use one of the cryptocurrency exchanges, I recommend CoinDeal which is pretty non-problematic. You've got broad variety of payment methods there, it accepts for example Skrill or E-pay. Quite fast way of buying Bitcoin and what's the most important- it's safe.
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:51:49

@_date: 2019-12-03 09:36:45

@_date: 2019-12-03 07:43:53

Okay but what is so special in that "new generation" of cryptocurrency exchanges? Now I use CoinDeal and there's nothing I can complain about, it has a huge variety of coins, paying methods and (what's the most important) it is very professional and safe. In what case these "new" exchanges will be better than this?
@_date: 2019-09-04 10:03:09
Maybe you should try Skrill or Epay? As far as I know these payment methods are available on CoinDeal you mentioned
@_date: 2019-09-04 12:43:48
Imo the most encourages thing about these tokens are lower trading fees and because of that I though that give away won't last so long, but 50 mln is a bit to much
@_date: 2019-09-04 10:50:03
That's common problem that credit cards payments aren't accepted while buying crypto. On buycoinnow you can also try pay with Dotpay, Skrill or Neteller, maybe it will work
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:05:22
Coindeal might be good option now because of a give away of tokens for new users and free deposits in USD, EUR, PLN, CHF and GBP, it was announced recently. Also there are a lot of less known coins, which are profitable too, just like you said, not only BTC is noteworthy
@_date: 2019-09-11 07:15:51
To be honest with you, Bitcoin isn't cheap so small amounts of BTC are also a huge investment :D So, I recommend you to register on an exchange, that's the safest way. Just choose the right one, for example [CoinDeal]( \- this is my exchange which I can truly recommend.

In my opinion, this is a good time to buy BTC. But remember that Bitcoin is rather a long-term investment and you need to be patient. It's always risky so watch out. Not only Bitcoin is profitable these times but also some altcoins like LTC, XRP or NEO.
