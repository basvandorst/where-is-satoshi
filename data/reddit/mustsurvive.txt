Maybe humans should be made infallible, so every project is risk free. Until then, using printed money to finance projects means taking risks with other people's money (as the value of new money comes from diluting the valuation of the current supply). 
It is more profitable to let money and resources be managed by their owner, as he has the proper incentive of weighing a project's benefit against its risk.

So this New World Order, consisting in most conspiracies of (Jewish) bankers, would instigate a non-bank currency? Sure. 
And the government could force citizens to use &lt;bitcoin&gt; debit cards for all purchases, prosecute any other purchase and disable the &lt;bitcoin&gt; debit card for 'bad' citizens. 
But replace &lt;bitcoin&gt; with any other currency: they could already do that. Bitcoin would make the wire transfers if not anonymous, at least pseudonymous, and thereby a huge improvement.

How have they been bought and sold?
In my opinion, the new Greek government started in good spirits, but found out quickly that there really was no cash left to do all the good things they wanted to do. Instead of selling out, they took a harsh "we're not going to sell our souls" negotiation stance with the EU,which only meant even less money on the table.

If you set up an account with an exchange, it will probably, depending on the exchange, hold it in dollars or other 'money'.


Yes, it could have. To be safe from this, you move your bitcoins from the exchange to a wallet of your own.


That depends entirely on your countries tax code, IANAE.


The 20-40% deposit tax imposed there would not apply to your bitcoins, or be unenforcable. 


Seems like it's dropping already.

I don't know, but it's not mentioned anywhere. There is a 0.5% fee on all trades (with volume &lt; 500), and then 0.90 on SEPA withdrawals. Seeing that the fee schedule goes up to 150,000 USD and their 24h volume is 4000 BTC, I don't think your 2000/10= 200 BTC will be a problem.

It does affect the price. Assuming both buyer and seller want to hold them as short as possible, the seller has to take an ask as it stands, thereby adding the current bid-ask spread to the  price, even if for a picosecond. If the seller sets a bid at current bid price, the volume of their transaction will be unavailable to the market for the time it takes to fill his order. (And then I'm assuming a buyer buying and transferring bitcoins to the seller in zero seconds.) 
You're right that this does not significantly influence the price right now, but it might in the future.
