@_date: 2017-12-17 00:35:07
Because of the seed?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:13:19
So you recommend coinbase?

HODL! am I doing it right lmfao, thanks for the legit response. I feel like half the people on this sub are trolls 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:53:19
Do you recomend I move my BTC to gdax then bitwallet or send it straight from coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:20:10
Uhhh I just withdrew it from gdax and it didn't appear in the bitwallet acc............
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:02
How do I go about generating this QR code and keys
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:37:26
I think I'm just going to go with the paper wallet, your explanation clears it up a lot! I couldn't find the samourai wallet on the iOS store, so do you recommend any others that have this sweeping function that are on it? Like bread wallet or block chain? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:32:13
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:24:29
Aw shoot, I think there was a transaction fee. On gdax it says my withdraw limit is $83 I had around 110
Also yea sorry you can prob tell how much of a noob I am 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:29:35
Oh wow that's odd
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:17:12
Idk, i mean i guess I have to do it either way it just weird... idk how to phrase it ahaha 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:26:56
So you get abused in real life and you decide to take out your frustrations online, in the form of being an ass to people? Gosh no wonder you have to beg for love
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:00:24
Ok what is Hodl, I'm guessing it means Hold? Ahaha 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:07:05
I'm just doing reasearch and everyone is talking about coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:30:32
I did this but since there is no mobile app for gdax I can't really check it so is it good to move it back again to my coin base acc until I'm about to make the wallet. Also when I do make my wallet how do I keep track of how much I'm up or down on my investment? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:16:14
to go about doing the first part, you mean I would create the key from the website and then find a online wallet that accepts the key correct? And the second part I thought the website generates a qr code. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:33:18
THeres some good information on this whole thing on the sidebar( if you're on pc) I'm kinda new as well so if you want look at my recent posts where I ask things that I didn't know. If you decide to invest Gl

i_gotta_say this subreddit seems to be your life
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:07:54
For the BTC address on gdax I put the public address correct?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:45:13
The moment you posted it online was when any joe could see. No need to take ur anger out online man, take it out irl (like in your pottery)
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:23:02
Ok, but in how long should I actually get worried
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:30:09
do you know  any for mobile? iOS
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:26:23
uhHhHhHhhHhhHhhHhhhH not on my CHRISTIAN POST
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:33:20

@_date: 2017-12-14 02:51:47
Gotta be
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:09:34
On gdax I go to withdraw the BTC and it asks me for a destination, do I put the public address of the bitwallet or the private key
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:31:23
That's what I also thought but I saw you being an ass and bringing up elementary school
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:43:01
Just use this thread 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:09:29
Do you recomend sending the BTC to the public address of the paper wallet through gdax or coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:10:24
So what happened???
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:17:51
Ok thx
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:59:21
Hook me up wit dat
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:02
Well if I'm going to be using another service. I don't see the need to have it 
Is that a bad idea?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:57:25
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:30:19
So now they think bitcoins are like dollar bills 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:39:11
Under the accounts tab it should show a your first purchase, click on it and it should show the subtotal which is how much you actually bought 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:01:43
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:33:12
Paper wallet is just a price of paper correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:39:01
I have, but I like to be able to see how much I have made, and these online wallets make this easy. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:19:13
What do you mean I have to write it down manually 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:15:05
What's the private key do?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:49:28
I'm going with bitwallet 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:22:36
Heyyyyyy... old time friennddddd
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:57:58
Okay last question. So you recommend I use mycelium instead of bread wallet, and I should only use those when I'm ready to spend the BTC? so I wouldn't go ahead and create one now? Also should I send the BTC to the public address of the wallet through coin base or gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:32:52
ohhh ok I know what you mean. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:40:26
Ok I downloaded bitwallet but have no clue how to send the BTC to it
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:19:32
Ok yea I was about to say thank you for the help�� Ik I could've just used the wiki but glad u helped

You can customize it and pay like a certain amount every year.
