I mean... this is the third version of Megaupload to exist. He lost the other two. I don't know if I'd necessarily trust him to hold on to a lot Bitcoins personally...

(*-For a year until it either gets raided or somehow taken over by Chinese fraudsters like his other two cloud services)

For a tech magazine, Wired is pretty off-the-charts ignorant about tech stuff sometimes.

Popularity. Everything goes through the same cycle:
1. Thing is made. It is good.
2. Some people get into it because it's good and it gets *really* good. 
3. A lot more people get into it because they hear it's good. This makes it less good. 
4. Government/business types get into it because it's popular. This makes it get really bad, really fast.
5. Everyone keeps using the thing that now sucks because that's just how it's always been.
Then someone invents a new version of the thing and it goes back to 1. Money is at 5. The Internet itself is at 5. Bitcoin is transitioning from 3 to 4. :)

I personally put a bit of money in today when I saw it was trading for almost half what it usually goes for, but not enough that I'll be mad if I lose it all. If it goes back to it's old price, that'll be nice. If not, oh well. I've wasted money on dumber stuff. :)

They're like EA, except with EA microtansactions you actually get some virtual coins. :(

As someone who knows nothing about the technicalities of Bitcoin but likes the general idea of them, in my head I've just sort of got it down as: something fucky is happening, it's to do with something called the block chain, and some people seem to be quite annoyed about it. :)

So, I'm a ridiculous noob so I apologize for the ridiculous noob question but... who do these fees actually go to?

I think I can fix this for everyone. All of you get together and send me 25.47 BTC and I'll totally make sure all those people get what they were owed. It may look like my account gets deleted immediately after the transaction clears, but that's just so the press won't hound me about my generosity.

So he's Unbreakable Kimmy Schmitz?

Er.... why don't you post proof that all of that is correct? Why should the burden of proof be on everyone else every time someone posts something outlandish?

Even so, I don't think paper money is going to go away within one generation.
