This is true for any creative activity, not just coding.  
But in this case it is not really a problem, since commits need to be pulled by some human reviewer. You can't just start adding garbage to the code-base.

For anonymous payments a participant is anyone that is mentioned in the contributor-statistics of Github. For more control over the payment (for instance only pay to invoiceable parties) you need to be signed in and pay from your Mobbr account.

Agreed. But gaming is not easy because the Github repo is 'moderated' (not all pull request need to be honoured).
Having said that, handing out a fixed salary every month is not very fair either. Paying for actual participation is a much better solution.
Rewarding the Mobbr way has other benefits too:
- it stimulates ad hoc participation
- it brings economic freedom: 'just go online and add value'
- it makes social collaboration steerable, by adjusting the algorithm
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:08:51
It could. If Github would supply the metrics. Mobbr is agnostic about that, it's 'just' a payment system for online collaboration. Every site can implement it's own Mobbr support, supplying it's own algorithm. See: 
So the bitcoin community could take their favorite tools and Mobbr-ize them. For Github we implemented our own coupling, because obviously Github has no native Mobbr support (yet).

Exactly. Thank you. And there aren't that many ways to earn bitcoin for labour. Enough to spend your bitcoins, none to earn. It's only half an economy still.

Not true. How did you reach this conclusion?
There are levels of identification. KYC levels. To be able to send or receive large amounts of FIAT currencies, you need to be KYC-ed to passport or ID-card level. But for cryptocurrencies or small amounts, this is not needed.
Also you don't need to link a bank account. We ARE a bank account.
It's the (European) law :)

*EDIT: problem solved itself*

Before I answer this question, let me ask you a few questions ;)
How would this attitude work for you in real life? If you work for a boss, or do a free-lance assignment, would you increase the margins or your reports and use double line heights to get away with less work for the same salary? Would they hire you again?
Online is probably not very different from IRL in that is always possible to cheat. 
The Github repo's are moderated, the pull-request will be reviewed before pulled into the main branch. If somebody is consistently writing sub-optimal code or is always cheating, there is always a possibility to address this 'problem'. And there will be social control. The majority of your online coworkers would like for their project be successful, and they won't like their online income or collaboration to be jeopardized by a few leeches. So there is lot's of controls outside the algorithm.
(If you would ask me, Github should have a voting mechanism, with which people could vote on the quality of a commit. Something like that. That would make the algorithm smarter. Github or Gitlab or Bitbucket are not yet very advanced collaboration platforms, they will probably evolve.)
The algorithm itself can be made as complex and adaptive as you like. we could even calculate the size of the commits persons make and normalise/weigh that. But in the end we think a simple algorithm, maybe even which a slight touch of randomness, as life should be a little unpredictable ;) , will function best.
The current algorithm does some normalisations to get the peaks out, but  would indeed assign more weight to your second code snippet. 
Remember this is just te beginning. It is not perfect, but I for one would like very much to be earning a living by contributing online, like Mobbr enables. That things are not always perfect or fair, is a fact of life.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:27:12
Question back, if you look at the current distribution, for example here: 
Do you think this is highly unfair?
Note that the current algorithm weighs contributions less for each week farther back in time, as too stimulate new contributions.   
@_date: 2015-04-11 09:47:03
Good question :) At the moment these amounts stay reserved for eternity. An anonymous payment clearly cannot be revoked or repaid or reclaimed. There are several options, the one we will probably implement is re-dividing the money over the devs that did sign up after a certain amount of time. 
Within the Mobbr system, these unclaimed payments can be revoked by the payer.
Suggestions welcome.

I once was lead architect and devleoper on the mechatronic/robotized shipping container terminal of ECT at Port Rotterdam. A 250.000+ lines of (C++) code system. I built fire-fighting and damage control systems for military ships. I think I know complex systems ;)
You should probably not start talking before you did some homework of yourself AND understand the Mobbr algorithm which is not based on LOC.
You sure you are qualified to enter the internets without guidance? :)
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:58:50
We will look into that. Mobbr just needs the minimum access.
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:48:49
In fact, thanks to this way of rewarding, you can actually steer the participation. By change the algorithm. The current algorithm does not reward adding lines more than deleting lines.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:15:10
Gavin, In the end it is up to you (the community) and Github to come up with a algorithm. Mobbr itself is agnostic, in principle. For Github we just made an initial suggestion. We also support other tools, Mobbr is not at all Github-only. For instance Stackexchange is supported too. 
But it is weighing and normalizing multiple factors, and it can be tuned. 
Read my comment here please:  
The way Mobbr is designed, the algorithm should in principle be provided by the collaboration platform. By adding a piece of metadata to the HTML . See: 
For Github and Stackexchange we implemented the algorithm at our end, because they are BIG and they have a nice API. They could implement Mobbr support and offer a dashboard to tune the algorithm per project or question or issue.
In general these kind of algorithms need active factors (those that one can influence himself) and passive factor (outside the control of a person). In the Github case the platform offers to few passive factors. I personally would like some 'wisdom of the crowd' mechanisms on Github and Gitlab and Bitbucket. For instance to vote on the quality of a commit. Voting on things. This could help the algorithm.
For example, here a completely different algorithm, based on voting: 
It can also help not to pay on whole repo's, but to pay issues and milestones. In fact, when an issue or milestone is not yet closed, Mobbr automatically becomes a crowdfunding tool.
I will put some examples and advice in our descriptions here soon: 
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:05:58
At the moment deletions and adds have the same weight in the algorithm. We also weigh in commits. And more recent contributions have a higher weight than less recent. 
But this can easily be tuned, or made adaptive. Just make a suggestion!
In the end, this should be Github functionality, Mobbr just needs a payment distribution key.
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:13:04
No, it just gives the equivalent in all wallets in your preferred currency.
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:57:03
The algorithm does NOT favor bloated code or larger commits per se. It can be tuned to need. It is slightly adaptive too. 
It could just as easy favor deletion of lines. 
More important, no one here actually tried it ;) or has any experience with this way of rewarding. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:16:53
This can easily be done by crowdfunding issues and/or milestones on Github. While an issue or milestone is open, Mobbr holds the funds (payments to the URL of that issue) in escrow until the 'closed' trigger comes. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:40:35
Correct. We used 'user' scope. Now, no scope.
@_date: 2015-04-11 09:43:27
Actually Gavin already said it looked quite fair. 
And we don't use LOC as a metric. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:43:39
That is very easy with Mobbr. You can pay issues. As long as they are open, Mobbr is in crowdfunding mode. In fact, this is how we developed our own software. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 09:32:04
As said many times in this thread, the Mobbr algorithm does reward on lines of code added. It uses a slightly adaptive mix of deletes, adds, commits and some time factors. 
If you look at the actual distribution, the core devs we spoke actually find it quite representative.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:05:36
The best quality is probably delivered by people that are driven by idealism and other intrinsic factors. And lot's of spare time. And enough money to be able to do it for free. I believe this group called be called the 1% of the 1/10/98 rule. 
The next 10% however is better motivated by rewards. There is some (Dutch) research on that, by Irma Borst. We need those for better continuity and production.
If you are living in the slums of Mumbay, India, you cannot do it for free, even if you wanted it. You need money for basic living. So rewards are important, they bring freedom. Isn't that what bitcoin is about?
@_date: 2015-04-11 09:38:40
Special 'outside the Github workflow' activities can easily be rewarded by paying or pledging to issues that represent these activities.
Every participation should be rewarded. The problem currently is that  a lot of things are not done on Github and that Github is not measuring everything. Mobbr can be used in combination with EVERY social collaboration tool. We can support Kanban boards, we already support the Stackexchange sites, we can easily support issue trackers etc. etc.
It is also very easy to integrate other rewards models or combine them. In fact the Imperal College, UK already does, using Mobbr. Part of the reward based on participation, part based on more traditional contracts.
Saracen? Well I don't know. The Mobbr API just reads the Github API, I will look into this.
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:40:01
It is fixed. Scope is now on 'read-only access to public profile only'. Public-auto profiles can be fixed of course. We will do a review of those settings, it is a bit a balancing act between being able to show activity and social networking things and privacy.
@_date: 2015-04-11 11:05:11
This can be done with Mobbr too. As long as an issue or milestone is still open, any payment is 'crowdfunded'. As soon as the issue is closed, it is divided among participants. In fact we do our software development like this, we pledge on issues and our developers work on them. 
Like this: 
@_date: 2015-04-11 09:26:39
The Mobbr algorithm rewards 'changes' in code. Not only LOC / lines added. Deleting lines of code is counted too. It does some normalisation to get rid of peaks / extremes.
