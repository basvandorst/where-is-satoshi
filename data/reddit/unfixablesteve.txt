63%, 80%, what's 17% among friends. 
(can you imagine saying that about literally any other "asset", lol)

Where's the evidence it's exaggerated? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:47:49
There's literally no evidence I could have provided that would have been sufficient for you if you already want to believe.

"All In"

People should learn what a margin call is. 'cause an awful lot of folks "invested" cash they don't have.

Let's try to triangulate between anecdote, survey data, economists expressing concern, and banks showing concern. Now strictly speaking that's inference and not evidence, but the preponderance of evidence is *only pointing one direction*, making it a reasonable inference.

Ohhh, ok, so "living your life in crypto" isn't agreeing to get paid in crypto, it's maintaining a constant income in American dollars that you then convert to crypto. Which conveniently doesn't leave you exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations since you always have dollars. Got it. Real commitment.

In the meantime, people invested their life savings. So.. yeah, might be a need to rush.

"All in" is agreeing to work for 5 or 10 (or whatever) bitcoins a year, by your own definition.

Besides [banks restricting access]( for fear that folks can't pay their bills, [numerous anecdotes]( and [concern among regulators that people are financing purchases with debt]( not much evidence I suppose.  Because evidence is confirmation the "system" is out to get us. Or something.

What are you on about? Or did you reply to the wrong comment?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:16:58
They're basically arguing the only way Bitcoin's price is sustainable is through concerted market manipulation. Lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:04:37
How many anecdotes would be sufficient for you? Data [showing 18% of bitcoin purchasing is happening by credit card] ( probably wouldn't do it, huh? Because "survey results aren't valid" probably.
