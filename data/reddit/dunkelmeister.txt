Mt Gox trade in different currencies. Not many exchanges do that. All of you putting all this pessimism will kill Gox. 
If they do go down the price will drop... public opinion will be negative and it will definitely be a huge set back.
Gox will die if the community doesn't support it. I just hope that another exchange will be able to trade with a myriad of other fiat currencies.

It's Mark Karpeles creating a company to buy cheap coins. LOL

Yes the biggest cost in the long run is the cost of electricity. If you have it free then you're going to make a lot of money as you do not have any running costs. Could I host my gear at your place. ;)

You can always change to millibits 0.001 is 1 millibit. Then microbits 0.000001. Anything beyond are called satoshis. At this point 0.00000001, some people have already switched to this when we hit $1k mark lin 2013.

How did you lose it? Did it get stolen?
You can't say you lost something if the price goes down or make something if the price goes up until you actualise it for some sort of value.

Yep I follow the same view, I have BTC in many different wallets and accounts... I also have BTC in Gox. Should it go down, I don't know what it will do to the whole economy.
I hope they do fix the issues for the sake of the other people and the whole good of the economy.
We should also all sign for Karpeles to be kicked out of the foundation and that's one aspect I am sure about.
Either way I see this ending badly on all sides.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:54:20
That's not a big variable... Do you mean if the price dips all the way down to 5% of total value?

What is a real OS to you? I have been in the IT industry for 2 decades and it's definitely real.
Could you indicate what people should be using?
If anything people should be using cold storage for what they cannot afford to lose.

What I meant in the last sentence... a lot of people and businesses have already converted to millibits when we hit $1k.

We should have the Google Glass and other wearables on the store soon.

Hmmm people still have funds... I know a few who have sold high and buying some at these low prices in case the issue is resolved.
@_date: 2014-03-12 07:42:30
Thanks for your response and suggestion.
I have checked with all different browsers and they all lead to the shop.
@_date: 2014-02-23 23:40:20
What, why do I get downvoted for that?!? If it doesn't cost electricity you may as well run it. I know everyone running CPU and regretted not running it on a lost to what they thought back then. GPUs came, the same issue happened.
Do you see a pattern?!? History repeats itself. Same with price, peaks and troughs!
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:48:08
No worries!

Hi all, myself and a mate will probably be able to make it.

Doesn't China own a good portion of the American debt?
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:50:06
Sometimes you forget your last advertised price... I had a look recently and I still had something well overpriced. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:40:26
Ermmm... they're selling now... quick sell! You might have to rephrase that. ;)
There's always people buying and selling, that just part of the Bitcoin life.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:41:28
It was more rhetoric... anyway doesn't that say much about what China can do? Owning quarter of the US debt in bonds. They did it so they can squeeze as much as they can before they put the US to their knees.

I have my Avalon for months now... so the slogan fits. Still waiting for BFL. BFL's new slogan - we really don't know what we're doing!

Please elaborate... I too am pre-IPO. I would like to know more than one word, or are you one of these people that think everything is a scam?
Perhaps you haven't been too careful and get scammed a lot.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:42:51
I second that!
@_date: 2013-07-01 10:31:54
I can see the point. I have been mining for a bit now... if AsicMiner(AM) did not exist I would be able mine more.
There is also the point of whether or not AM can manufacturer 51% of hash network. 
I also have AM shares and I hope that Friedcat stays true to us all.

All links do not work at all.

They promised too much delivered nothing so far... communication is key, so is experience. I am still waiting to see what they deliver, I will not order anything from them in a rush... Possibly never!
@_date: 2013-10-07 06:27:08
I have one to be released from customs, I would sell depending on your offer. Location Sydney, Australia.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:24:18
Nicely put! This is definitely not like any market in the world. I have been day trading since low as low as $8 last year.
2 days ago I saw a down trend and was expecting $300 and was expecting this to be like some of the financiql markets that have existed for centuries. 
It did a 180 and shot straight up with so many bullish buys. Really it's a gamble either way you go. Remember not to spend what you cannot afford to lose. No matter what anyone says, Bitcoin is definitely thriving and will go up eventually. Good luck all!

I pledge 1BTC for Josh to cop one!

Isn't that what BFL pride itself look and feel... to deliver the Aston Martin of miners?
