We need to build up a player base.
We might add some clearly marked bots to play with when no real players around at first.
You can still win prizes though if you wait or invite a friend to play. If you win a game even with 2 players you still get the bonus for 1st prize :)

To test we are rewarding each kill with 1 satoshi. If you win the game you get a bonus 100 sats. The rest of top 5 spots get a prize too.
We are waiting to be approved by some ad platforms and we will show ads. The more traffic and more revenue from ads then the bigger we can make the prizes in future.

We own btc already and will continue to buy in future

We are waiting on facebook approving our app and should add that option very soon. We also plan to add discord and telegram login. Open to other suggestions too.

Hi r/bitcoin
We just released a beta version of a new 2d battle royale game. 
It is free to play in your browser and every time you kill another player you earn Bitcoin.
There's extra bonus prizes for being in the top 5 players at the end of each game.
Since this is a beta version we are looking for feedback and suggestions on improving the game. We have some features coming soon listed in our roadmap.
Let us know what you think.
Edit: if anyone can create the subreddits bitshowdown or bitshowdown.io and make this account admin we'll tip some btc. This account needs to be 30 days old before we can create one

We dont want to store usernames and passwords. It's safer for players that way. Also means players don't need to rememeber yet another password.
