Hello community. My name is Ty, but I go by "Oh, The Future", because...oh, the future is (insert descriptive idea of the times we live in). I am using my band's reddit handle, and honestly, while I’m here almost daily reading and learning, I don't really post here, admittingly.  
I love this BTC charity idea and hope that people will benefit from it greatly. Not companies, corporations or false organizations, but human beings. People with names and feelings. 
I have, myself, made out several paper wallets to give to friends and family for Christmas with ten or fifteen dollars worth of BTC on them. "Bitcoin is best understood by experiencing it", as Aantonop says. Paper wallets are a great way to let people experience bitcoin, and is one way I began to understand it more. 
The reason I am posting now is because I'd like to share a story. My story of recovery from opiates. Something a lot of people never achieve or survive. If interested, visit [my site, OhTheFuture.]( for the story. I was a junky for many years, turned my life around and have chosen to follow my heart and dreams with no fear.  
Today I'm a student, musician, and a music writer(see the site for details). I've been clean 7 years and am hoping to inspire others the way I've been inspired. This is my number one goal.
Regardless of anyone viewing my site, even reading this, or sending any support, I hope that those who are fortunate enough to give a BTC away(25 times or at all) have many years of happiness, joy and peace. We don’t see enough of this kind of grace and kindness in the world, let alone in the world of money and finance. 
Cheers to you and yours! 
Sincerely, 
Oh, The Future
