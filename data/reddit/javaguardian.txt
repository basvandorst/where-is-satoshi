Yea I recommend anyone to come in here to check it out like biznizza recommends, to verify it inside and out. I have nothing to hide.

I mean it's pretty simple and still I'm even flabbergasted by all of this. It's pretty much if you're in the negative, it will show up in your coinbase balance. It's kinda like Paypal. If you owe them stuff, you're gonna be in the negative. But not only am I not in the negative, I showed biznizza all that stuff. I mean, all this stuff coinbase can look up himself. I just find it so strange that they are just stalling, stalling, and more stalling. And assuming let's say I make this all up, ok? Like I'm not being legitimate. Then all coinbase has to do is look up on their side and be like, oh, this dude is a liar. He photoshopped everything. I mean, the evidence I have they have to. It's not like I have some magical undercover evidence that no one but I can see. I just don't get why they keep stalling. It's just so absurd.

Maybe you should take your LQ ass out of this post you tool :)

Why dont you stop ignoring reality and realize that coinbase is about to get their asses sued. Its ridiculous how they open themselves to such things. Its literally ritual suicide.

Same here tool.

Well I disagree with you. Enough said.

Currently getting my legal papers together and not giving a dam to what you're saying.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:59:04
Well it all stems from the fact that they still need to honor my 100 BTC deal and all I see in my eyes are them trying to not honor that deal by keep referring to a previous resolved issue. I doubt they're gonna sue me. It's all crap talk trying to divert attention to something else. That's what I think is happening if Olaf and Brian Armstrong keep ignoring me.

Yea of course. Why the hell would they lose a lawsuit if they honor their side of the deal? They wouldn't even get sued in the first place. Your comment doesn't even make any sense.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:05:37
cuz they say i owe them thousands. im gonna be screen sharing now to show you my balance atm. it's not negative so that's like first level proof right there. 
come check it out. im out here to prove my innocence so it's nice as many people see that i speak truth it's good.

They don't. They deliver by mail hence by the original post. They just reiterated the fact that they're going to sue me after I messaged Olaf on reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:03:09
no it's real. they messaged me on reddit that they will sue me. lol. Olaf that is.
