Rename it to "Social Service Provider".
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:22:18
*Groups* of individuals provide services. It takes a village and all that.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:44:34
How so?
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:29:35
What exactly are you arguing?
I agree gov't authority is a fiction, they should just be a service provider and yet here you are.

Before there was nowhere for the regrowth to go after a crash (whether you believe it to be on purpose so the rich can increase wealth buying everything for pennies on the dollar or not), but now instead of regrowing the traditional economy, it can go into bitcoin and out from being under the influence. This will catch old money by surprise.

3% for any "foreign" conversion outside USD, GBP, EUR.
You aren't paying for a chequing acct at a bank every month and your money grows faster without a $5000 minimum just to get 1% interest.
Also I see this as an interface for legacy payment systems, and that is how they should be referred to. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:51:05
Same place who's dollar will drop like a bag of hammers next time the richers are ready to cash on a crash. What's crashing next, car loans? Or we doubling down on mortgages again? Lol

Anonymous, but the numbers are publicly open to inspect and prevent transactional anomalies/fraud.
If you had an "account" though, you could always check your own vote since it's on the "ledger".
You could even do things like change your vote at any time for non-confidence referendums and whatnot. You'd need a populous interested in updating their tabs though.

It would be funny to see the next currency collapse happen and bitcoin is the saviour currency unaffected. The greedy pigs at the trough could be their own undoing, running right along the same lines as this show.

Good for him. Good work ethic.
I hate the youtubers complaining about not being paid over the censorship-free medium they can make their own money off of. The platform is still free, use it and ***do*** something about it!
Wonder if he's ever dealt with the CRA's incompetence and had his accounts seized accidentally. That teaches you a very, very important lesson when you can't go to the grocery store, you can't get paid but you still have to go to work until they unfuck themselves in 3 weeks of bureaucratic bumbling about.
