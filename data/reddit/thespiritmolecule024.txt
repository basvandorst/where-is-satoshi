I see, i appreciate your help! I did indeed use the same email associated with my btc wallet, so hopefully my funds will just end up there agan. but as of right now i still dont have them. i also dont have the same 'login to claim' button you have though.

All i did was go to 'send' , and typed in my email address. Coinbase says you can send btc via email, and i got the email saying i received it, but i dont have it

Why would they have the option to send it via email then. and furthermore, why would i recieve an email saying that the btc has been sent to me if it cant be sent via email?

Yeah i know they don't scam, it's just strange.
I just read in their support page that any btc sent via email that isn't claimed in 30 days is returned back to the sender, i just don't want to wait a whole month for my money :/

Yeah it left the account instantly when i sent it. And i know to be safe, i just assumed that if the service im using to store my btc has the option to send it via email that it would work

I don't know, i'm not extremely knowledgeable about BTC or the way it's transferred.

On coinbase, there is the option to send btc via email. i did that, but i don't have the money. just the email saying i recieved the money.

The issue is resolved, d341d was correct, the coins are now in the Coinbase wallet associated with the email, it just took a few minutes. Thank you all for the help!

i just assumed you could then transfer it to your google wallet
after receiving via email

I'm not sure, but why would Coinbase have the option of sending Btc to an email then?

well it's definitely not in my wallet lol
