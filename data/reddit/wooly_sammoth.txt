Screen shots aren't too impressive at the moment. the prototype coinflow app is very similar to an IRC client with a big area at the top of the screen for displaying text and a text input area at the bottom for entering commands. I've put a screen shot here if you are interested [Imgur](
  
The idea to begin with has been to display simply the sorts of things that netvend is capable of rather than providing a great graphic interface (for now).  
  
There are plans to produce videos and other promotional material but for the moment I think the best resources are [syrivens' website]( and the [netvend wiki](

It broke the bot. not entirely sure why. just debugging now.  
If it isn't immediately obvious why, I'll make the transfer manually and debug further in the morning.  
Thanks for the re-tip

:)  
The excited feel of your comment echoes my feeling about netvend.  
What and have created is a great yet simple idea. It is a platform that is enabling to devs like myself. If I have an idea, I can develop it and then plug it into netvend to benefit from the community, Web of trust and micro payment opportunities it presents, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.  
I for one am really looking forward to what the future holds for netvend as I think the idea is a winner. Having spoken with quite a bit, there is no resting on laurels either. This is an idea that is going to be developed and iterate until it perfectly fits the niche it already fills pretty well.

Hmm, sorry about the balance issue. We are going to work on it to get coinflow working properly. In the mean-time you can log in as the faucet account 'correct horse battery staple' to have a play around with the commands of coinflow.  
Things like account management are also planned for coinflow, we just felt it was important to have features available rather than a snazzy UI.  
Watch this space.

I gave a simplified answer a go elsewhere in the comments.

I've just pushed some changes to the coinflow app. I've included the PyCrypto library in the repository so there's no need to install that separately.  
The README now has installation instructions for the rest. I hope it all makes sense.  
The issue with adding a new agent still exists. For some reason the initial tip to fund a new agent isn't working as new agents don't seem to be registering correctly on the netvend server. Until that is fixed, feel free to use the agents already created to have a play around. 
They are:  
/login correct horse battery staple  
/login test1  
/login test123  
Apologies for the inconvenience.  
  
  
Bare in mind too that this is a very rough, first prototype of a coinflow application. As says, it is clunky and has been thrown together in my limited free time.  
Don't expect whistles and bells but it does serve as a good indicator of the simple tasks achievable through netvend.
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:47:46
Yeah, sorry about that. There does seem to be an issue at the moment with creating new agents from the coinflow app where they aren't getting properly funded from the faucet and so queries are failing.  
If you want to have a play with the app you could try logging in as the faucet agent. Type '/login correct horse battery staple'  and you will be able to see everything on offer. 
Sorry for the inconvenience.

NuBits are a crypto-currency that have been designed to not have any price volatility.  That makes them good as a currency for day to day use or for tipping.  
NuBits have been pegged such that 1NuBit will always = 1 U.S. Dollar.  
There are innovative systems in place around that peg in order to maintain the price. For more information take a look at the [NuBits website](  
Questions will be happily answered over at the [NuBits subreddit]( or on the [forum](
To get you started:

All very good points. There is space made in the BIP38 proposal for future changes and tweaks to the implementation. I am sure that consideration would be given to backwards compatibility though, it is a system that has gained quite widespread use.   
Your point about 'where will bippy be in 5-10 years?' stands too. My counter would be that the code which details the Electrum seed encryption method is now in the public domain. The code will remain on github as long as that exists. It wasn't a huge jump away from BIP38 in methodology so could be reverse engineered should the worst happen and all githubs' servers get wiped. 
  
Consider too that the entire openssl project is undergoing a huge amount of scrutiny and change at the moment. What if an issue on the scale of 'HeartBleed' was discovered with the current implementation of AES-256-CBC, causing a mass update and rendering any strings encrypted with the previous method unsecure, obsolete or un-decryptable? Unlikely but as we are playing what if I have to raise it as a possability.       
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:49:35
I'll work on some simplified instructions later on today.  
I totally get the need to make it easy and will be working on getting some pre-compiled versions ready so that coinflow will just run with one click.  
The issue with that at the moment is that it is easy to be suspicious of a new tool, especially when it is asking you to randomly click an unknown file.
That said, there should be an easier way to get it running. As i say, I'll work on some instructions later today.

It sounds like your raspberry pi was using a pure python implementation of Scrypt to take that long with the correct password. A compiled C version (as in bippy) takes a matter of seconds to do the same job.  
 
The specifications for BIP38 are up on [github]( and have been looked over and adopted by many people.  
You are right in saying that it uses AES256 too but the addition of Scrypt to derive the encryption key is the important step.  
As stated on the [Scrypt web page](
"We estimate that on modern (2009) hardware, if 5 seconds are spent computing a derived key, the cost of a hardware brute-force attack against scrypt is roughly 4000 times greater than the cost of a similar attack against bcrypt (to find the same password), and 20000 times greater than a similar attack against PBKDF2."  
  
The Electrum seed encryption in bippy isn't true BIP38 as it isn't detailed in the original specification. It does borrow very heavily from the ideas presented by BIP38 though so is, to my mind, as secure.
If you want to take a look at the code to see what it's doing, the full repo is [here]( and the Electrum specific file is [here](

Lol. Very cool
Not seen this bot before. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:28:08
Thanks yes.  
It looks like the initial tip from the faucet agent isn't working correctly.  
I've manually tipped you until I can get it working properly and push the changes.  
Apologies for the inconvenience. could you try coinflow again now? thanks
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:42:40
I'm seeing the same. If I /add a new agent, the tip from the 'correct horse battery staple' agent goes through and is confirmed but the new agent still shows a 0 balance. Also the new address doesn't show up when I try /listagents.  
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:16:23
It's these kind of ideas that will make netvend great though, thanks for sharing. I almost feel that there should be some kind of netvend based open forum for sharing and voting on ideas for netvend and allowing devs to bid on them.   
(note to self. Do these things!) 
@_date: 2014-05-27 10:28:04
ooh. I think this was meant for you.
5 cents
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:21:42
Because you said please.   
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:00:44
If you send a pm to the bot user with the text +accept in the message body, it will set an account up for you and credit the tip.  
If you're interested in what NuBits are you could check out the [website]( or come say hi in the [NuBits sub](    
Thanks again for the heads up 
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:50:52
Hi.  
whisper users a 2048 bit RSA Key generated with [PyCrypto]( which is then passed through the [PKCS1_OAEP]( module to do the actual encryption. The public half of the key is published to netvend and both the public and private halves are stored in a local sqlite database.  
To encrypt a message, netvend is searched for the receiving agents public key and that is used to encrypt the message. The receiving agent then decrypts the message with their locally held private half of the key.
The system is proof of concept at the moment so all messages are encrypted using the same default password and the local database has no protection as yet. These things are in the roadmap though. Until they are implemented I would advise against using the prototype coinflow app for transmitting any secrets.  
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:06:59
These are good points. I'm afraid the answer at the moment is 'I don't know'. It could certainly be built into any client to ignore any posts over a certain age or with a certain prefix, but that wouldn't remove it from the server.  
The problem I could foresee with allowing deletion of data from the server is that the current api is very open. Allowing a command to remove data could be used as an attack vector with fairly disastrous consequences if not implemented correctly. It would need some serious thought about how to get it right.   
I haven't had any hand in the development of netvend itself so can't say either way what the thoughts of the devs are. This is just my take on it. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:36:57
I wasn't trying to say that it would be impossible to decrypt, more that relying on one tool over another can lead to issues.  
I understand your point that bippy seems to be a point of failure as it is currently the only implementation of this type of seed encryption.
I would hope, however, that it would become more common place as demand for cold storage solutions like wood wallets increases.  
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:42:36
Cool, a puzzle :D.  
I'll get digging and see if I can figure it all out. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:26:45
I'll give it a go.   
  
netvend is a way for people with cool ideas to get paid for them. The crypto crowd is famously paranoid and getting started with a new idea is difficult. By using netvend a new service can start to be used without needing to earn the trust of the whole community.   
The way this works is through tips. Tips are like upvotes but backed by money. If you tip someone for providing something good or useful, their standing in your bit of the netvend world will go up. As you use netvend, you will start to see more of their content and the content of the people they have tipped. If you see a new service it will be because it was 'recommended' by someone who you have previously tipped so you can be more confident that it's good and safe.  
  
As a user, coinflow (the netvend client) will look a bit like the Twitter or Facebook feed you are used to. You will see posts by friends, have chats with other people who are online or send secret (encrypted) messages . Along side that will be services ranging from weather forecasts to coin flips, live music streaming to kick-starter clones. You will be able to easily check that these services are legitimate by checking the level of trust that they have earned from your friends or the wider netvend community. In that way, good services and users will be rewarded and prosper while trolls and scams won't earn any tips and will get no attention.    
(I hope that all makes sense and is on point. It is my interpretation of what I think netvend does. I'm sure and will step in and correct me if they feel I've over simplified a bit) 
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:53:28
Getting netvend APIs available in different languages is a fairly high priority. A simple Java API would open up netvend to a load more developers.  
  
I for one think that would be very useful.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:58:08
Is this with coinflow? 
The query errors shouldn't matter, they are mainly there for my testing. 
You should have some balance automatically as soon as you've created an agent.
Is there a message you are getting specific to changing your nickname?
I'll take a look at this in a bit and see what's going on.
Edit: The query errors are to do with the client looking for whispers to you. That bit of functionality is very new and i hadn't tested it with a new agent (note to self. Test things with a new agent!). 
I'll take a proper look at this this evening and update the client accordingly. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:57:32
You can check the qr codes by scanning them with a barcode scanner on your phone. There are different ways of encoding text in qr codes so I wouldn't worry that the two are slightly different. (the actual bit that is the text is really pretty small. The rest is there to check and verify).    The important code for securing your coins is the BIP38 code which starts '6P'. That is your private key which has been encrypted with your passphrase (think two factor authentication). As long as you have that and remember your passphrase, you will be able to access your Bitcoin.  
When you are ready to import your wallet to your computer you can use a tool like bitaddress.org or bippy.org. Download either, disconnect from the Internet and decode your BIP38 code to access your private key which can be imported into your hot wallet.  
@_date: 2014-05-28 08:58:41
I've updated the README on github and added the PyCrypto library to the repo too.
Hopefully that should make coinflow easier to get started with

No IRC as yet. I'm mj2p on coinflow so leave me a message there if you like?
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:49:29
Yeah I saw that but after it was too late. Judging by the repetitiveness if the requests I'd go as far as to say it is a bot.  
I'm running the NuBits bot so can see that the tip hasn't been accepted. If it's a bot I doubt it ever will be.   
  
Lesson learned though. Sorry and thanks for looking out.

no wallet integration as yet but coinflow is currently a very simple netvend client. 
Python was used as the Python API was the first available. i believe that a Javascript API is available to and more will be available as they are created.
The local webserver is a good idea. I just stuck with what I knew to get the basic commands working. There is a lot of refactoring to be done and future designs won't look at all like the current offering.

Hi runekri3. Good to hear from you.  
That error certainly doesn't look good. I think know all we can do is wait for to see this comment and see what's up.

@_date: 2014-05-27 14:43:56
There isn't currently any verification at the client end but I agree that it is a needed feature. I've been tinkering with coinflow / netvend in my spare time of which there hasn't been a huge amount recently. The coinflow app should be viewed really as a prototype and showcase of some of the more basic possibilities of netvend.
