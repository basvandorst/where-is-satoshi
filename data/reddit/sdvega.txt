So how can I as an American get a Venezuelan credit card for my debts? This sounds like a great offer! Lol. I'm serious though. Where can I get one currently

just checked it out for first time.. Seems really expensive. The rates for trading USD for BTC seem high to me
I think the reason things like Circle are popular because of the very low fees in buying bitcoins.

I just transferred some BTC from my wallet on loclbitcoins to my new copay wallet on desktop.
[Copay says I paid 0.007361 fee](
[But on the Localbitcoin transaction page though, it says it should have been .00036201](
Why did i pay so much?? It came out to about $15 USD fee. I thought the whole point of BTC was that transferring is cheap. $15 is not cheap!!
So did LBC screw me, or copay wallet? Or did I do something wrong?

At this price is mining becoming popular again? I never did it and have no idea how but always heard it was expensive and time consuming
