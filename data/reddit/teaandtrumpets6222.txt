Umm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but he killed himself during the bear market.
He use to be a regular in an irc channel I use to frequent, and was quite the mess after the crash.
A news article was found and it was assumed it was him.  The little details we knew about him led us to believe it was really him.

No I'm not, I hate the deviancy that is being pushed on our society as healthy and righteous .   Our society is being polluted  from within. There is a systematic agenda to bring down the western world .
  Clearly this is way over your head ,as you eat up the shit they spoon feed you.
