If you're looking for news that gives you solid buy or sell signals...you're probably not going to find it.  Best I can suggest is to read the crypto sites to learn about new projects that you may want to research further. 
Journalistic integrity is pretty low among most of the sites. If an author is really hyping up a new coin, there's an extremely strong chance he was paid to do so, even if it isn't flagged as a sponsored article.

Follow the big names first like Vitalik Buterin, add in the big guys from the Bitcoin world.  Charlie Lee from Litecoin, and just go from there.  
Twitter is where the crypto influencers and movers and shakers communicate publicly.

I did something weird when I first got into bitcoin.  I asked people who were already into bitcoin which wallet they used.

I've got almost 50% of my savings/investments in crypto right now.  The crypto portfolio is absolutely outperforming the non-crypto right now, and it's nowhere close. At the same time, I'm a strong advocate of hedging, and having a wife and kid means it would be irresponsible for me to go all in.

It could have decreased by $2500 as well though. 
I sold at $7500, and I'm happy with my 400% ROI.  BTC could soar to $25,000, but that still doesn't make me stupid for taking a 400% ROI and turning in my chips. Then again, my financial future doesn't completely depend on BTC soaring through the roof, so my perspective may be different from others.  
For people who are poor right now, and holding BTC as their primary retirement asset, they're kind of dumb if they don't cash out some of it and diversify their portfolio.

Yeah, if you have $500 let it ride now. If it doubles then awesome. :)  
I know a few people, largely acquaintances, who have over $100,000+ worth of BTC, but other than that don't have much. I suggested to them that now might be the time to put a big down payment on a house or some other permanent asset.  They're free to take my advice or discard it.

Yup.  While bitcoin as a currency has withstood several shocks, Bitcoin as an ever-increasing safe asset remains to be seen.  
What happens if one of the main holders decides to exit their position, for example? Will it cause a panic crash?

Yep.  Sometimes banks really are assholes who just don't feel like giving out business loans for less than $500,000.  But sometimes it's just that the bank is taking a realistic look at your growth projections, financial projections, and your business plan and coming to the conclusion that you don't know what the fuck you're doing.

Nah, Cockchains are the next big thing.
