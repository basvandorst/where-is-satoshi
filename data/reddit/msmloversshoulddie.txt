If you're not good at it, timing the market sucks. People who aren't confident experienced traders should set a goal target and stick to it.

Futures aren't even remotely the same as an ETF. People who knew anything were talking about price going down or staying the same/no effect from futures, not mooning. 
ETF lets more money into the ecosystem faster, that's why it's bullish news.

I'd just buy them all before it hit zero, prediction false.

And all that action will happen with Bitcoin in the back end, so it should directly impact price as people buy it.

The delay is for the Direxion ETF, CBoE ETF is still on schedule.

Yeah you can probably have the equivalent of the local sheriff just repo some furniture for the cost of whatever they won't pay, and the company would likely just fold and pay right there. 
There are some stories of people doing that to bank branches that wouldn't release their money in the US.

Set a target and stick to it IMO, and take some gains (if you can afford to). 
I regret not doing it at last ATH.

I've been holding forever and a day because I truly believe that, regardless of whether they like it much or not, Bitcoin is going to eat the lunch of the entire financial system at some point, and that's a million dollar valuation easy given the total coin cap.

That actually sounds awesome, thanks for your post - very good explanation.

Okay Freud, sure.

Do you just have it set up to automatically turn on your miners with excess energy?

When it happens (whether this time or another) it will make it easy for large sums to move into BTC, as well as make it so that layman investors (e.g., people with retirement accounts) can get Bitcoin that way.
The reason people are excited about the ETF is that it will be Bitcoin on the actual backend being bought, even if those people have their coins in custodial storage. There's plenty of people who might get some of their retirement in Bitcoin if it were as easy as telling their retirement manager to add the ETF, but won't if they have to deal with a wallet.

The delay is for a different ETF

Can you elaborate? I picture certain issues when I think of the UK but I'd love to hear a native perspective. 
I feel really bad for my British friends when I think of what's been happening to the UK since 2000.
