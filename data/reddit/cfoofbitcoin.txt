thank you. assuming that is true, that is an advantage of accepting bitcoin as a charity. who knows this though? 
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:56:54
Just tell them there is no chance of making a profit on the bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-09-19 15:01:29
Why exactly do you want to accept it?

[i'd say yogapants are more undervalued that Bitcoin](

Perhaps a better article would be why bitcoin is as high as it is to begin with?

look up "dead cat bounce"
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:56:19
Wouldn't it be easier to just wait for it to drop on its own?

 Just sold everything before it gets worse.

The majority of people bought in at close to $1000 so no one is going to spend them unless they reach that price again. If no one spends them, there is no utility, which will keep the price down. 
It's a vicious cycle. 
Some people have to take a loss by spending them so that others will make their money back. Do you spend yours?
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:00:20
I think that's the problem. People are learning more about all the risks and nothing is changing to fix them. Gotta get out while you still can.
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:25:35
In a word, yes.

but the price of bitcoin has dropped 8% since yesterday. and then add in the fees of converting to/from fiat. it just seems unnecessary in your case and maybe even expensive for your nonprofit. just looking out for you, bud.
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:17:27
There are no buyers right now. That is why the price is plummeting.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:18:03
Gold is down 0.7% at the time of this comment. 
Bitcoin is down 8% in the last 24 hours. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:58:22
People are beginning to actually understand what bitcoin is/does. There is just no need for it and people who have it are starting to get out while they still can.

You realize this will just add more downward pressure as they convert it to fiat upon receipt?

@_date: 2014-09-19 15:14:59
Serious question. What is the advantage over fiat for your nonprofit? 
If you can answer that you might have more chance of convincing your boss.
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:12:47
fair point. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:35:47
Can you expand on that thought a little? I am curious to see what you mean.
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:12:14
the fact that there is no specific reason other than the novelty wearing off is troubling. I got out. You should think about it too.

out of one billion unique visitors, less than 150,000 were interested enough to subscribe

one third of reddit traffic is international. I know it is hard inside the bubble to think about. but almost the entire world has zero interest in bitcoin, even if we would like everyone to want it.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:09:39
it isn't really spreading though. more people seem to be selling btc and swearing it off after their losses than people that are adopting it. we live in a bubble because we read r/bitcoin everyday that makes it seem like everyone uses it. 
For example, out of almost 1 Billion unique visitors to reddit, this sub has less than 150,000 subs. That is :
150,000/1,000,000,000 or 0.015% and one could argue that redditor's are much more likely to be interested in bitcoin than the general population

2000 bits @_date: 2014-04-10 21:58:26
I said people, not coins. Of course most of the coins went for cheap. 15% of the coins are in the hands of two people who got them for free. It started to get a lot of press when it hit $1000, which is when most of the people came running in.

What price did your mom buy in at?
