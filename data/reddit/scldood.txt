If Amazon makes an agreement with a company to handle the conversions of piss into giftcards cuz they wanna be in the "piss as a payment option" market and then they announce that they are now accepting piss as a payment option through some piss intermediary, let's call them PissPay...then yes, Amazon, in that scenario, accepts piss as a payment option.

Lol, yeah, I totally agree with you. Just wanted to play a bit for fun and I really wanna avoid the "bad" ones.

Based on the comments here and my own research, I think I'm gonna go with Bitstars for now. Thanks to everyone for the insightful comments!

Not sure you know how facebook works there bub
@_date: 2014-10-22 02:38:56
Wow, you're a bright one!
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:32:35
I was considering trying them out then I read this:
But i don't know how reliable that site is, they seem to categorize every other casino as a "scam".

Thanks! That really helped, was looking for a good revenue estimate for TigerDirect!
@_date: 2014-09-04 00:41:09
Thanks! I thought that site might have been full of shit!
@_date: 2014-10-08 01:07:40
Thanks! I've looked through their whole list a few times, unfortunately they include a lot of companies who don't actually accept Bitcoin as a payment option. They just have them on there, like Kmart and Amazon for instance, cuz you can buy a gift card from Gyft.com using Bitcoin and use it at those retailers.

I think you're confused
@_date: 2014-09-04 11:23:05
Thanks for all the help/advice. I think I'm gonna go with Bitstars for now and see how that goes!
@_date: 2014-09-03 19:45:15
To be honest with you, I didn't even have them in my sights, but now I'm thinking I'll give them a try. Thanks!

Bitstars was actually my top pick before posting here for a place to have fun with a little light gambling. I was curious if anyone had a bad experience with them or Betcoin Casino, but I didn't wanna mention them by name.

You're an idiot. I never said I was I was running the contest you moron. I just thought people might like to know about it.
@_date: 2014-09-03 17:17:31
Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2014-09-03 17:18:38
Ok coolio, I'll check them out! Have you more or less been "lucky" with them?
@_date: 2014-09-03 17:17:13
You're happy with them? No problems? I've read a few posts on here and people bashed their "provably fair" system like crazy.

Thanks a lot. I'm going mostly for big companies who post their annual revenue and bring some value to bitcoin in the process. I've got Zynga, 1-800-Flowers.com and Expedia rounding out the list, just need one more good one!
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:41:11
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:19:44
Oh wow, thanks a lot for the info! I'll check out all your options. I was thinking an order of 25 to 50 btc to start and go from there.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:20:05
Located in Canada, but frequently travel to the States.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:24:26
Lol, was that a joke?
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:01:43
I actually opened an account with them and they seem like a viable option. I apologize, I've just heard mixed reviews from people in the past, I thought you might have mentioned them sarcastically.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:20:32
Was thinking around 25 btc to start, but if I can get a decent rate then maybe more.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:13:37
Bulk, meaning like I guess an order of $10,000 or so? Not exactly sure, but I think around that much. Located either in Canada or the US. Travel a lot.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:15:59
Have you heard good things about genesis or have you used them yourself?
