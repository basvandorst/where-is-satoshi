IMO all credit unions are good.  They are nonprofits and all money goes back to members in the form of dividends.  I get a dividend each month on my checking account with JSC federal credit union.  Another advantage is that they are all part of a cooperative so you have the benefit of withdrawals/deposits from other different credit union branches.

Artificially reducing risk through fractional reserve banking causes misallocation of resources.  When loans are easy to make banks care less who gets them.  People take out loans for cheap with poor business ideas only to waste resources on that failed idea.

Two questions:
1)  Does every single satoshi have it's own individual identifier? If so is it some long radom character/number combination or are they just numbered 1 through 21,000,000.000,000,00?  And do they need an individual identifier in the first place?
2)  Explain the deference between a full node running Bitcoin Qt/Core and a miner [node.]  If a miner is running solo does it need to integrate somehow with Bitcoin Qt/Core?

Eliminate public schools and take your kids to a school that teaches curriculum that match your beliefs. 
Stop taking money through coercion and let people decide how to spend it.  Maybe you would like to donate to a hospital or clinic to help someone else.  Maybe hospitals decide they want to help people in need.  
These things used to happened before the nanny state got it's grimy mitts into education and healthcare.

Trace Mayer and Erik Vorhees; the opening is Stephanie Murphy. Banks and dollars work for the time being, but do you really think the current financial system will still be intact in 50 years?  20 years?
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:13:18


Fixed it.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:41:00
Great point putting it into perspective!

Wow, that's a great article.  Nice to see a whole 2 pages in WSJ on bitcoin in such a positive light.  Bravo.

I think Charlie Shrem did this in another conference last year.
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:19:23
Well done. 2048 bits @_date: 2015-01-14 07:48:36
Yeah, at this point it's a piece of cake.

I sell groceries to restaurants for a national broadline distributor.  I will use this.  Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:27:37
Great book!  I'm not super technical so there are some parts that are over my head, but I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the writings of our hero, Satoshi Nakamoto. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 12:02:03
Like Dave Ramsey says, "if you do not have any debt and you must invest in a single stock do not invest more than 10%." (He is a big stock mutual fund guy and doesn't like bitcoin, but I think it can take the place of a single stock.)
@_date: 2015-05-19 21:38:23
"Conventional wisdom". Really?  GTFO.

I just saw this on my Airbitz wallet this week. I want to go to the GRB and check it out!
@_date: 2016-06-16 02:56:07
What about just plain old more users sending transactions during a price rally? What if they didn't know what fee to spend or what wallet to use? What if they paid higher fees in the first place? Then blocks would just be filled with different transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-12 13:07:05
We just passed $650 so you may be right. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 00:25:48
It doesn't matter if more and more wallet devs try to fix the problem with higher fees and smart wallets. If everyone is doing the same thing nothing is solved. We just end up back where we started. Just unconfirmed transactions with even higher and higher fees. The only solution is more transactions per second within the protocol; whether that is through larger blocks, or less bytes per transaction, or some other first or second layer solution.

Around town it's a nightmare. What a freaking mess!
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:06:01
No, for centipedes. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 19:33:45
Yep, it will most definitely be a good thorough episode. Mike always puts out good content!
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:35:20
We did too. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 11:16:28
No brakes! 
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:32:21
Got one here.
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:11:33
You're mixed up here. USB block eruptors are for mining; full nodes are for validating transactions. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 11:15:48
Give that man a coat. 
@_date: 2019-10-17 09:59:08
Rimworld approved.
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:11:39
We'll done. Good analysis!  I love using purse.io. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 22:05:28


There. That's better. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:17:36
Same here; buy when there is blood in the streets. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 11:25:09
This ^^
@_date: 2015-08-29 10:55:22
@_date: 2015-08-10 01:03:26
James, I love all your videos.  Great work and we'll done!  Don't let the naysayers get you down.
@_date: 2015-08-14 10:32:03
WTF? Lame. Yeah credit unions. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:21:50
They just added Lowe's; previously Gyft only carried Home Depot for that type of retail option. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 11:45:48
Perfect. This is exactly what I needed. Thank you! 
@_date: 2015-07-18 17:28:43
Is there a way to get the private key from the wallet backup?
@_date: 2015-08-17 10:48:49
Good analogy. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 03:34:46
Go to  for reliable hardware. 
You will basically trade electricity costs for newly minted bitcoins. 
Use  to determine your future payout. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:29:30
This is a gem. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-07-19 19:15:58
Both of these commands are giving my the same result... am I doing something wrong?  I still cannot see the private key.
./wallet-tool dump --dump-privkeys --wallet=bitcoin-wallet-decrypted-backup
./wallet-tool dump --wallet=bitcoin-wallet-decrypted-backup
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:13:12
Ok, I found them.  Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:22:20
Agreed here. I participate. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:23:01
Great news!
@_date: 2015-07-30 02:21:29
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:18:08
Well, maybe but it made me laugh out loud due to it's ridiculousness. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:51:13
Same here. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:12:01
Great prices for the used mining equipment. Anyone else actually get what they paid for?  I'm leery. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:53:10
But it's necessary
@_date: 2015-07-10 10:45:11
This is good news.
@_date: 2015-07-21 13:24:38
Tipped Bitnodes. Bought a HDD on eBay with Gyft. Bought a bitcoin key chain and tee-shirt.

More wallet ratings:

I've gotten 5 of them at different times for exactly $5 each. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:55:42
Looks like a 2013/2014 chart. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 10:21:00
It's a soft fork. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:07:06
Aha! Privacy. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:32:22
Running into these same exact problems.  About to give it a shot after reading though ya'lls discussion!
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:00:50
Best part about this is the fact that this conversation is from 2014! 
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:28:12
Yes. Microcenter. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:04:47
IT WORKED!!  :)

@_date: 2015-09-04 01:48:30
Slush. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 06:04:51
Agreed. And it's an important experiment using Counterparty on top of bitcoin. Also the Tokenly SwapBots are BADASS.

What are you talking about?  I have researched XT and it makes perfect sense to me. I listen to a lot of podcasters daily (as I drive around slinging mayonnaise) and the vast majority of them support BIP101 and/or XT.  It just sounds like you're spreading FUD.

I use Eligius because I think it's the best pool (with Slush in close second.) I don't care if Eligius is religious; that fact does not affect me. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:24:27
Yeah, day traders watch 24/7 and have a disregard for wisdom.

What's the question?

That made me lol. Thanks

I run a full node on my Linux desktop. Soon it will be on a RPi 2.

My guess is bitcoin 2.0 protocols such as Counterparty and Mastercoin. Dust actually has way more value of you look at it that way.

I tried running a full node on a RPi regular model B and it couldn't hang. It kept crashing, so I think the RPi 2 is more suitable.

Same goes for altcoins!

Something similar to this happened to Paul Boyer of The Mad Money Machine a few months ago.  It's always good practice to hover over links and see where they lead!
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:57:14
Exactly.  Lucky duck!
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:57:26
Nice work BTW!  Sounds great!
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:29:41
Done and I think everyone knows the answer to the last question...
@_date: 2015-03-24 10:46:45
Very nice collection!
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:02:37
Agreed.  Tumble them through Shapeshift into altcoins then back to btc.
