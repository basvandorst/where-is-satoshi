bitinstant is actually a pretty bad way to get bitcoins.. it's expensive and also a hassle as you have to deal with moneygram. I think it gets recommended alot mainly due to bitinstant's engagement with the community.. their staff post a lot here and on bitcointalk.org.

$40 on $1000 is 4%; worse than cavirtex's fees. you could buy BTC on cavirtex, transfer them to mtgox and sell them there to get USD into mtgox cheaper than wiring $1000 there directly.. especially since the cavirtex prices are usually lower than mtgox anyway (ie, a better deal on the buy side). It may not make so much sense to sell there though.

Currencyfair seems to be charging just under 1% to move CA$1000 to EUR SEPA transfer.. that's not too bad. You could also look at  they may have slightly better rates.
bitstamp, bitcoin-24, btc-e, mtgox, bitcoin.de, intersango, bitcoin-central all have euro bank accounts.
As a general pattern for people anywhere in the world the cheapest way to get bitcoins is probably going to be; find an fx company that will take your local bank transfer and turn it into a euro SEPA transfer (which are free) and then send that to one of the above exchanges.

My advice would be don't - at least not for buying.. sign up with  and verify so you can use bill payment from your online banking. This is very convenient and free. You can also do cash deposits without verification.
If you don't want to use cavirtex (why?) then maybe try using  to move your CAD into a EUR SEPA deposit to an EUR accepting exchange.. mtgox is one, but requires verification before you can use that functionality.
 is a pretty good EUR exchange and I would recommend trying it with them first (they don't require verification for SEPA transfers). If the process works well then maybe you can verify with mtgox and do the same there.
You can of course simply wire money directly to mtgox's japanese USD bank account; this will incur heafty bank fees so only worth considering if you're sending more than $1000.00 imo. This does not require verification unless you're sending &gt;$10k or using tor or they randomly decide you look suspecious.
