Even if BTC could solve their financial problems, the politicians would still kill it somehow in favor of tax, debt, and spend.

I couldn’t agree more with the OP. It seems counterintuitive but the less a network is hyped, the more stable it appears to be. 
We need to let a decentralized network “speak” for itself.
I’m actually starting to question my faith in ETH as a long/term Titan of crypto.

Sorry, you’re just poorly informed. Thus, everything i say is flying over your head.
Republicans and Democrats support the MIC ... this includes the surveillance apparatus that sprung up after 9/11. 
The companies that produce the weapons, technology etc then fund the elections of politicians that favor giving them contracts to support a never ending global war. 
BOTH parties are in bed together on this.
The two party system is simply an illusion.

As it has been and as it will always be in Argentina, the root cause for their problems is the socialism.

Last one. The Nordic nations have been allowed to have generous social programs because the US has subsidized their defense spending with NATO and instituted the Marshall Plan after WWII.

Let’s start from the top.
Republican = Democrat = Republican = Democrat =
It’s all an illusion for uninformed citizens to believe that  career politicians in the two separate parties are some how noble individuals with noble intentions. 
Voting, within the current two party system, is not going to change anything. Regardless of is the politicians platform speaks to rural whites or minority city dwellers.

They’re trying to control the conversation and thus suppress the paradigm that decentralized currencies can supplant fiat currency. 
For the past decade, all they’ve been saying is that crypto is used for nefarious intentions by those with ill will. 
Since it’s become bigger than they thought now they relent by saying blockchain tech is a redeemable quality. 
Standard political doublespeak.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:05:11
Dude, have you watch BTC’s price history? There have been bear markets that have lasted for years but it’s always roared back higher than before.
Crypto, in general, hasn’t even hit its global stride. Plus, Wall Street is getting ready dump billions if not trillions of institutional US dollars into the market within the next two years. 
We’ll look back at the $700 Billion crypto market of 2017 as the “early days”.
