"Stop acting like such a cunt"
take your own advice, thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:09:16
wasn't meant to be, I'm just telling you to take your own advice once you have a chance to get off your high horse 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:35:38
he's been in it for  a little over a year now I believe 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:51:22
ok thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:39:34
Dp you think I should buy today or tomorrow night? I hear the price usually dips a bit a bit so would Sunday night be a good target point?
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:29:37
weird no transactions showed up on the search even though I"ve sent bitcoin to my ledger before....fuck I hope I didn't get hacked :(
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:05:24
Does that mean that the price will dip a little bit?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:46:30
Ok thank you, I have one more question sorry, wouldn't I be in danger when I have to enter my private key in coinbase to send the bitcoin to the nano, or when I send the bitcoin to an exchange to sell and have to enter the private key there? Since I have to copy paste the keys in the send or receive place aren't they vulnerable there?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:34:30
so if I bought on coinbase and moved it right to a nano ledger I would be safe from private key hack? sorry I am a noob
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:29:00
this was their response
When I have to do many transactions like 2 exchanges between them, that's awesome. It will set the transactions done to a minimum. And that's the most traffic, I'm pretty sure. What it won't affect is the single transaction between you and me for example. If I open a channel, I'm not able to use that funds I did.
Ofc I can let be it open for others if I don't need the money right now . But they have to connect to me. That's a transaction in the end too.
And by the way it will most likely only work with small transactions, depends on the nodes and what value they stored in the channels. I can't transfer 100 btc via lightning if the channel only was feeded with 2x 5 btc.
Next thing. Ofc I can send one single transaction via lightning so someone if I don't need the funds. But everytime I wanna spend my money I have to close the channel and the transaction is written on the blockchain.
Other currencies have better blocktimes, safer systems, better wallets, lower fees, anonymous adresses. That's why they are superior to bitcoin with ltc.

I found the photo but I'm not posting it in case i get banned or something
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:14:18
could this scenario happen on a S Nano Ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:50:04
oh thank god thank you, I was about ready to hurl
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:19:47
dumb question, do I need to have my ledger plugged into my computer the entire time I wait for the it to be transferred there?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:26:51
it made it! thanks goodness 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:33:20
what do you think it could be worth in a decade or so?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:55:34
futures are also very close, this looks fishy to me
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:34:52
yes it is the same address I double checked it, coinbase still says pending on the transaction so that's good I think....I'm going to lay down for awhile and try to calm down smh, thank you for your advice
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:35:44
haha you wish
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:06:07
pre-pre-sold to insiders. It was insta-mined at launch.
geez that is very concerning wtf
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:49:06
does that mean since I bought my 1 coin over a span of like 10 transactions by buying pieces of a coin I will have 10 $5.25 fees?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:30:52
I live in Minnesota so I can't use Gdax, does that mean I have to pay that kind of money just to take my bitcoin out of coinbase and move it to my wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:18:18
what the hell we have to pay that much just to move from an exchange to a hardware wallet!?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:06:26
I think you give a lot of fucks as youve been spamming this all day lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:28:58
Nobody cares about your political views dude hence the downvotes, this is about Bitcoin go whine to your family if you want to let your political feelings be known
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:26:06
wut, I never sold I just want to buy more
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:38:39
You can do that? I have been frustrated because my work bonus doesn't come until February and I was going to put the whole thing into Bitcoin so I open a new credit card up to use with 0 APR for 2 years only to find the extremely low limit on coinbase smh
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:21:37
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:36:11
What I really wanted to ask was if you think we should be worried about Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:45:20
aka "I hate Wikileaks because they are exposing Democrats instead of Republicans now'
You should be very proud u/magpietongue these people are just caught up in their political feelings
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:18:40
I'm not doing s*** I'm going to keep what I have for the next 8 years or more
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:43:53
I find it interesting how it's always a redditor for 4 days or 6 days or 8 days that tell people to avoid Bitcoin on this sub Reddit 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:00:25
Won't hackers be able to hack into my computer and then see what my recovery phrase is when I set it up since it is connected by the USB cord to my computer?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:59:41
Interesting so I should buy more bitcoin around noon tomorrow instead of tomorrow night?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:28:23
why on earth would they make you pay money let alone THAT  kind of money? Are you sending it to an exchange or something?
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:38:04
Oh God keep going I'm almost there
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:02:46
What is the difference between the two?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:52:10
is it a set fee or is it a percent? I would be moving 1/4 of a bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:16:18
What do you think will happen
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:16:02
God damn it I've been holding off the past 3 days waiting for some kind of dip
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:02:35
nice math!
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:58:52
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:34:58
how come this guy has to pay so much to move his though?
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:45:40
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:26:09
oh god keep going I'm almost there
