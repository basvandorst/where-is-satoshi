Expensive lesson to learn. Double and triple check everything before hitting that send button.

Great question. It would seem the coins are stored in the private keys. Right? I could be wrong but if your private keys/seed are compromised, your coins are gone.

Really? September? Damn. Time to save up for some buying.

So a wallet is a portal to your keys. The wallet holds the private keys which are the keys to the coins. The blockchain is just a ledger, confirming the transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:51:45
This is shit
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:40:29
Yeah. Those too. Aggravating.
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:25:44
It’s not really 21 million. Think of all the lost coins. If 10 percent are lost forever, that’s 19 million. And they’re not all mined yet. .

When BTC is the currency
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:24:56
Heh? You watching the same thing we are? What are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:13:01
You didn't say that part. Your rent will be going up to offset the cost of electricity. Maybe not right away but once the property owners catch wind of this, they'll make an adjustment in your rent. Rightfully so. Till then, have at it. Just don't burn the place down. ����

Trezor One. So simple, it's laughable.
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:55:00
For all intents and purposes, isn't this just a computer that relies on back end services to initiate and complete transactions? It doesn't contain any actual crypto. So these guys are fucking idiots. What'd they get $50 in US coins?
@_date: 2019-08-20 13:03:14
Bad idea. They will bleed you dry. You're better off turning to fiat and heading to Foxwoods.
@_date: 2019-08-04 04:13:27
Moved some coin to a hardware wallet. The amount was substantial enough to throw a flag up. Now I'm nervous about it. I didn't cash out. I just moved it off an exchange.

RIP Chris Reeve. Still the best movie version of the Man of Steel.
@_date: 2019-10-02 22:44:12
You can go software; on your pc or mobile, locally or cloud based like Coinbase. You can also go hardware based, like Trezor. So there are a ton of choices.
@_date: 2019-08-04 04:19:14
Ah, so when you convert to fiat, that's a taxable event. Correct?
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:07:20
My investment was so minimal compared to my current holding value, it's worth it to just hodl. I've seen BTC go to $1200 and back down to $167 then shoot to $20K and back down to $3K. In all that time, it's never gone below my initial investment. So hodl. 
I wish I had dumped it at $20K, like many others, but nobody knew what was going to happen. If it hits $20K+ again, I might just dump one or two and buy a loaded Golf R. ��
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:20:43
Ok. That's pretty nuts. Time to rent a Uhal.������
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:56:51
Sorry for your loss
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:43:21
This is a good way to approach it.
@_date: 2019-06-10 11:26:37
Right, I mean everyone has different circumstances. So if you have the bank to sit for a while, do it up. If not, just buy coin directly. That's all.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:07:55
Thank you

Trezor One or Trezor T. Buy one, set it up, transfer coins, keep safe, no worries.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:01:56
Said multiple times before. And it still goes up.

Yeah, what's your electric bill like? You must have gotten some electrical work done to support this. How many amps is your panel?
@_date: 2019-06-10 01:46:35
Yeah, the money you spend on the rig and electricity will take you months, if not years, to recoup. And the difficulty will just get higher. Just buy coin with that money. Done.

I would recommend Coinbase to anyone starting in Cryptocoin without any hesitation.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:31:20
Yeah, seriously. Just hoping the exchange I'm on allows me to transfer easily. I'll test first with some mBTC.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:32:23
Seems cheap enough I might get one for my son.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:28:31
I bought one via Amazon. 
Details state it is brand new and sealed. I'm not messing with it unless it's legit.
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:25:45
@_date: 2019-12-27 18:22:31
Yeah, hopefully it’s not “the end”.
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:36:09
No, Bitcoin is driving the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-06 04:37:09
That's allot of money. Be careful.
@_date: 2019-09-08 20:15:14
$100 million? Da fuck? I'll take it.

Did you blow thousands of coins ordering pizza?
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:28:49
Imagine if we didn't need to convert to cash, and people just took BTC for payment. Wouldn't that be great? ��
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:58:31
What percentage of BTC owners do you actually think have a hardware wallet or print out? If 3%, I'd be shocked. I don't think it's a bad idea, it just sounds complicated and easy to fuck up. How difficult is that?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:56:52
Yeah but Dreamcast was so damn good. ������
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:04:24
Greater adoption, that's what we need. Then everything else will fall into place.
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:43:46
You did what?! Bro, get smart. That was dumb. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2019-05-20 07:18:40
Yes. Time travel to 2007, buy 1,000 Bitcoin and hodl till last year's ATH.
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:06:35
I knew that was coming. Ok, so half my coins were mined. The other half I bought way before they hit $2,000.
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:50:40
Correction was coming. Everyone knew it. It's just impossible to tell when to jump off that coaster. For me, I bought so low a couple years ago, it's not hurting my overall financial position to hodl. So I'll be fine. Saw Bitcoin hit $1200, then $167, then $20K, then $3K and again $8K. At this point I'm still way ahead. So just grab popcorn and watch.
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:22:55
Crushed? And they still keep tabs on that shit.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:25:25
You will need a wallet to deposit to.  And with your wallet address you can spend, if needed.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:30:45
No way really? Need a modded Switch for that?
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:03:28
This is what makes me want to get a cold wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-09 11:50:55
So once you transfer your coins to this hardware wallet, can this be considered cold storage? And for all intents and purposes, your coins now reside in this piece of hardware, so don't lose it. And can you transfer coins to someone else using this thing?
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:50:55
Weird. Ignore and live a full life.
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:33:55
Get your initial investment out and sit and watch. You're playing with the houses money at that point.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:34:29
I wish. I could go for two full coins
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:49:40
Well, ok, if he says so. Time to dump all my coins. Thanks, Warren.
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:59:39
Oooof, that hurts.
@_date: 2019-05-08 14:54:45
I'm about to go hard wallet on that shit. Tips? Advice? Trezor the best out there? Just scared to fuck up and lose all my coins.
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:45:13
Let's say BTC does hit $100K, and you decide to sell 1 BTC because you have a few. What would you end up paying in taxes?
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:21:49
What did the feds get you for? What was your tax rate? 40%? 50%?
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:00:31
Yeah, what if it gets wet. ��
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:58:42
I would shit my pants.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:46:15
How is this important? I never got why this means anything to anyone. Would knowing make much of a difference in the price or stability? Just my thoughts.
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:08:11
They've been on the Bitcoin attack lately. The other day they posted an article "How the weed-loving CEO of a bitcoin firm partied his way to jail"  which regardless of what this guy did, no one person is the CEO of Bitcoin. So obviously they have no clue.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:13:31
