No, he writes:


And then claims that the file Sartre hashes to 479f9dff0155c045da78402177855fdb4f0f396dc0d2c24f7376dd56e2e68b05.
Unless he has found a SHA-256 collision, that is a lie.

Yes, in the blog post he shows how to verify the signature




with the public key associated with address 12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S, which is known to belong to Satoshi.
This is a signature on the hash 479f9dff0155c045da78402177855fdb4f0f396dc0d2c24f7376dd56e2e68b05, which he claims is the hash of a letter by Sartre. But he do not include the full text of the letter, and the signature is also the signature from an old transaction, so I highly doubt that it matches the hash (that would imply a SHA-256 collision, which would be major news story in itself).

Gavin Andresen claims to have seen Wright sign messages directly, which makes me somehow doubt the following, so please correct me if I am wrong:
Wright claims to sign a Sartre text, but does not provide the full message, which makes it difficult to reproduce the hash.
The hash (479f9dff0155c045da78402177855fdb4f0f396dc0d2c24f7376dd56e2e68b05) and the signature (MEUCIQDBKn1Uly8m0UyzETObUSL4wYdBfd4ejvtoQfVcNCIK4AIgZmMsXNQWHvo6KDd2Tu6euEl13VTC3ihl6XUlhcU+fM4= or 3045022100C12A7D54972F26D14CB311339B5122F8C187417DDE1E8EFB6841F55C34220AE0022066632C5CD4161EFA3A2837764EEE9EB84975DD54C2DE2865E9752585C53E7CCE in hex) he provides matches the one on transaction [828ef3b079f9c23829c56fe86e85b4a69d9e06e5b54ea597eef5fb3ffef509fe]( which is a transaction from 2009.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

If anyone is curious, here is the plaintext that hashes to 479f...8b05:


To verify:

I am getting more certain that this is fake.
To reproduce: download the transaction here: 
Note the scriptsig from index 87 to 229 (30450221...3e7cce).
Now take the signature from Wright's blogpost (MEUCI...fM4=) and decode it using a base64 decoder (f.x. here:  ).
Note an exact match.

The key is the one associated with 12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S.

Well the only public place that would have signatures with that public key would be the transactions.
I actually started by trying to format  into something that would yield the hash, but since that failed I thought I would check the transactions.
It looks like found the transaction at almost the exact same time, so it can't be that difficult to find. I just wonder how Wright thought that he could get away with it.
