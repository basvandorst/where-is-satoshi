What I don't understand though - Why are ANY coinbase employees or associates allowed to trade crypto at all? Surely this qualifies as illegal by trading standards.

@_date: 2017-12-17 19:15:48
Depends on location - In London to own a small 2 bedroom flat about 15 miles from the center of London (£400k) is now considered 'rich' -  The average income is around £30k-35k, with cost of living one of the highest in Europe. £3 million is outrageous. Even £500k is mind-blowingly high. Realistic is around £200k and that's on a whole families income. Perhaps it's difficult for me to understand out-of-context.

I would, but tbh there's enough evidence to show wealth distribution under BTC is worse than fiat (imagine winklevoss twins owning 1% of federal reserve's).
Also there's a fair evidence that BTC is already a strong store in value (track it against dollar and gold index).

The lack of comments sums it up really.

If all of it is still on the exchange ready to be traded it probably still counts as expenditure, and therefore not liable for tax.
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:06:56
To be fair PayPal and bank transfer are free and instant
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:17:11
Never doubt the power on intra-spread trading against cryptocurrencies. The Western markets are... well.. stuffed, so this is a decent option.
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:27:18
In addition PayPal masks all bank details of the sender. Unfortunately with crypto you can track the sending address,and suddenly my have access to their statement essentially. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:27:11
I would almost certainly buy now. Missed the dip @ $5879 while I was asleep :(
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:51:14
Yes, I also have this problem - Personally shorting into a fiat currency helps me sleep at night, but USDT looks okay (I would use this too but my exchanges don't support it).
The exchanges that support fiat tend not to support many altcoins. You will have to make a decision to actively trade or short ahead of the exchange/wallet you transfer to. Remember as well, once the coinage is in fiat, are you happy with account security? If you pull out of the exchange are you happy with fees and transfer time?

You're darn right. As long as you mitigate the risks and prepared to lose some percentage after an unrecoverable crash, crypto is better than an ISA right now.

Yup, and timing was everything with the recent crypto-boom.

100 BTC? I saw hundred thousand units per trade, literally 100s of trades per second, we're talking the whole market cap of Einsteinium this morning being turbo traded by bots over like 5mins.

With the correction going on, you don't want to buy in just yet anyway. It's due to end soon, hold back

Probably should not advertise this.

@_date: 2017-11-16 22:39:40
It's about mitigating risk too. The drawdown of Buy and Hold is insane, and that is considering a *recovery*. If the currency doesn't recover, the consequences are even worse.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:30:04
We were -2.X% during the blow out today. Never seen it negative!

Nope, this is manipulation. Pump and dump on bitcoin. Coinbase is down, clearly an organised attack

Yes, because expenditure is deducted to calculate net gain. It is not liable for tax if you re-invest the bankroll into financial assets, i.e. BTC.

Bittrex allows users to trade without any authentication. As this user had 21 BTC+ from mid-2017, it is likely their worth sky rocketed. If the account if unverified, because of its value Bittrex security probably kicked in. This is not the first event

It was pretty dramatic. I noticed if you check the "Biggest Gainers" section on coin market, you may catch a short-lived pump and dump, although they usually occur on the lower valued currencies (presumably to take advantage of the low market cap).

Pretty certain of it too, it's legal tender, with recent news annoucing CME accepting bitcoin futures. It'll blow over soon, the MACD is swung ~-200, which is fairly typical end of correction.

It is, but as it stands BTC is not recovering against USD. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:09:53

There are plenty of out-of-the-box strategies that have been back-tested on BTC-USD data. The one I am using has a net gain of 7% and drawdown of 0.8%, and has historically predicted every major up and down trend. Many trading software provide back-testing support and predetermined strategies and signals.
Edit: Even without statistics, setting stop-limit sales on 2/3rd support levels is probably enough to ensure you don't take a massive hit if BTC-USD crashes. Buy-back when you feel comfortable. Remember risk is equal or more important than profit.
Edit 2: Keep up-to-date with everything and anything that your money touches.
Edit 3: Security, Security, Security. 2FA, cold/hardware wallets, split transactions, air-tight pcs... be paranoid.

Also websites are not traded as legal tender in Japan. You can't buy steam games, pizza, gamble or coffees with domain names.

The axis for the 'simplified market cycle' graph is wrong. This is a Gartner Hype Cycle, where Y-axis is expectation (these are psychological charts used to describe adoption).
The scale of the actual price chart is over some years, and has traditional cycles that differ to the Gartner - The crash, boring low, volatilic rise and finally bull run. We have just come out of a bull run, and are in the crash (bottom has not been hit, traditionally hits 20% of the peak price). 
The last crash was 2014, and boring low 2015-2016. The volatilic rise started early 2017, and bull run around August 2017.
