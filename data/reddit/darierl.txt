i'm out of the loop here, and i have £300 as a balance on MtGox..so, am I not seeing that money again?
@_date: 2012-08-17 12:47:01
I've been monitoring the price for about a year, to give you an idea about three months ago 1 BTC was about £3, over a month it was then £5-6 and seemed to level out at £6.
Now it's just gone crazy it's nearing $15 / £10 today.
I'm waiting a few months to see what will happen before I sell a small portion.
@_date: 2012-09-27 12:45:42
Damnit. You mind me asking what browser you used?
I disabled Java, that might cause a problem, I've tried using Chrome, Opera and IE, and all I get is a blank screen after I type an amount in and hit enter.
Ed: Just tried it right now using Chrome and it works perfectly, fucking yes!

Update, Intersango are now only trading in Euros, if you SELL Bitcoins with them the Euro amount will then be in your Euro account held with them. 
You can debit the Euro account and credit your GBP account by using the BIC and IBAN for your GBP account.

Natwest suffered a similar problem today, here in the UK.
@_date: 2012-08-16 12:27:57
thanks for that :)
@_date: 2012-07-18 19:09:10
When it's worth £150 I'll cash out £100 give it to her and leave £50 in there.
@_date: 2012-06-21 12:53:31
Very interesting, not something people like to see but important information.
@_date: 2012-07-16 16:15:30
I wouldn't say Bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme, also, if you don't like the concept why are you browsing this subreddit?
@_date: 2012-09-27 15:07:48
Several hours for me, still waiting.
Once all the glitches are sorted out I think blockchain might be the best option for UK users, though I've not tried cashing out bitcoins to GBP with them yet.
@_date: 2012-07-18 15:00:23
Just broke $10.00 according to Intersango, this is fucking insanity.
I bought my mum £50 worth about three months ago, it's now worth £100.00
@_date: 2012-08-17 15:58:22
just broke $15
@_date: 2012-08-02 14:48:39
Intersango have been been having huge problems, you've just spooked me enough that I've withdrawn all my BTC to a new Blockchain account. At least you can make withdrawls of BTC instantly, depositing GBP usually takes 24 hours, but the problem has been withdrawing GBP from your Intersango account to your GBP bank account with whoever.
I actually gave me trying to do this, I made a withdrawl request literally a few days before all their problems started, after ten days my request was stuck in limbo so I cancelled it.
@_date: 2012-08-20 14:27:21
I'd say unlikely, the fact that it's levelled out at £6/$9 after such a high is encouraging. I can see it only spiking and levelling for a while.
@_date: 2012-09-24 15:39:43
They've integrated Barclays Pingit, but I can't get it to work.
Also one of the guys from blockchain posted the link here, but he's not answering questions.
@_date: 2012-08-20 12:27:52
This, I find that bizarre.
Ah, it's a mockup.
@_date: 2012-07-19 17:44:57
It spiked crazily yesterday and was over $10 at one time, now it's stabilized just under $9.
@_date: 2012-08-17 16:57:59
That's on Internsango though.
Can someone explain to me why their buy rate is always higher than anyone elses?
For example, Blockchain's current rate, from my wallet value is £9.25 per BTC
Intersango's current rate for 1 BTC is 9.93, that's quite a difference.
@_date: 2012-09-24 15:41:06
Blockchain is the best online waller I've found.
I was using Intersango but they no longer process GBP to buy Bitcoins.
I'm a brit in the UK, we need more buy options, also transferring solf BTC to a GBP account.
@_date: 2012-09-27 13:02:03
Anyone reading this who is in the UK should definitely check out the PingIt app with blockchain, works perfectly using Chrome.
Just waiting for the payment to hit blockchain.
@_date: 2012-10-12 12:25:22
Ok, I'll see next time I use it, I bought £15 worth a few days ago and it was fine but maybe I juust missed the new restriction.
If you're in a real bind and need to buy BTC, check out
@_date: 2012-08-17 15:59:30
I agree, we've seen these bursts of activity then it settles down a few dollars higher than it was before, repeat, rinse.
@_date: 2012-06-20 21:27:48
It's my mum's money, she's just going to keep it.
The only time I buy BTC is when I have spare cash to buy stuff on Tor
@_date: 2012-08-20 15:59:51
you're right, if everyone did do that the economy as a whole would be a complete mess, and yes, I didn't 'know' but I was pretty fucking sure, and sometimes that's enough
@_date: 2012-10-10 14:43:23
It's awesome, great encryption too.
Also apparently they'll soon let you cash out BTC and deposit to your GBP account, but that's a few months away I think.
@_date: 2012-07-19 22:30:40
Thanks, that explains my problems.
@_date: 2012-09-27 13:11:17
Hi, how long did it take for the payment to hit your blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2012-08-17 17:03:09
Relax, it's a gif expressing surprise at the recent rate.
I swear to god r/Bitcoin/ has more uptight assholes than the rest of reddit combined. Well done.
@_date: 2012-09-26 22:45:00
I can't get that blockchain Pingit to work, I've messaged Blockchain, no reply. Has anyone else had any luck?
Ed: Update 27/09/12 - 13:55 - Fuck me, it works!
I've just tried PingIt using Chrome and it works like a dream, very fucking cool.
@_date: 2012-09-20 12:18:34
Have you opened a support ticket?
They no longer have a UK account with Metro Bank so ALL GBP transactions have been cancelled, you should chase them up. 
ED: Update, Intersango are now only trading in Euros, if you SELL Bitcoins with them the Euro amount will then be in your Euro account held with them. 
You can debit the Euro account and credit your GBP account by using the BIC and IBAN for your GBP account.
@_date: 2012-07-19 22:33:06
No problem, and thanks for the album, I'll make a donation once I re-fund my BTC account, I withdrew the lot to buy games of Steam, but that fucked up as Intersango..it's a long story, but cheers dude.
I'll give it a good listen later tonight.
@_date: 2012-09-27 13:04:28
Very easy on an Android phone but do you need a Barclays account with that card reader they give you.
@_date: 2012-06-22 01:42:57
do want
@_date: 2012-08-20 14:25:01
I pity anyone who bought at £10.00.
That said, I was a complete idiot, I should have sold at £10 then bought back at £6 knowing that the value would slip down again from such a high.
@_date: 2012-07-16 16:33:02
Because this a subreddit for the discussion of..Bitcoin..and I made a new thread related to..Bitcoin..(do you see a pattern emerging)..also you replied to my thread related to...(wait for it)..Bitcoin.
I hope that helps.
@_date: 2012-08-17 12:07:02
Intersango rate today: £9.63 / USD 14.79
insanity, it's a bubble, but I would say stay in for the long haul, it's rising progressively, albeit quickly
@_date: 2012-08-03 18:35:44
This is the second burst of activity in two weeks.
@_date: 2012-09-18 15:35:07
Intersango are a fucking nightmare, there is ALWAYS a problem for coverting BTC to GBP with them.
But buying BTC is very easy and quick, I wish they'd sort their shit out.
@_date: 2012-10-11 12:17:16
oh shit, I didn't know that, where did they say about the £10 limit?
@_date: 2012-09-26 22:47:00
Yes, it's a fucking nightmare. Intersango was the best option but they've had issues with Metro Bank for years, so now, no GBP deposits or withdrawls.
@_date: 2012-08-15 22:20:38
Really? I'm seeing $12+, it must have spiked.
Also would you say that blockchain is the most reliable and secure online wallet for BTC?
@_date: 2012-07-21 01:26:38
Wow thanks, most informative.
I'm just pissed off with the time it takes Intersango to fund my GBP account, fuck sake I made a withdrawal request four days ago and messages from my query 'ticket' is just fucking vague.
Though this seems like a complex method, but I will investigate turnaround and fees, cheers.
@_date: 2012-07-20 13:24:39
It really was, I believe it was related to that person buying $400,000.00 worth of BTC caused a panic of sorts. I was monitoring it over the last 48 hours. I have £50 worth of BTC which shot up to £102, this morning it's down to about £82. But I'm keeping them in there, they rate has stablised over £5 per BTC, a few months ago it was around £3.
@_date: 2012-10-10 12:03:45
Real shame, that said I moved my coins out with them a few months ago, I now use blockchain, not only is it the best online wallet for BTC I've found they also now have a Barclays PingIt service. So you can buy BTC straight from your GBP Barclays acccount using your Android phone.
It fucking rules.
(no, I don't work for them)
@_date: 2012-07-19 15:48:01
It would appear they've all been taken and yet no one has stated so, nice.
Some nice experimental stuff, I would say however that the site is rather sparce. Also info on the artists and albums would be nice. Also Chaos Theory has some nice stuff on it.
Ed: Also, album/track times would be good and the ability to skip through track sections.
@_date: 2012-07-22 23:26:35
on FOX
no but seriously, the forums are pretty good
@_date: 2012-09-20 23:27:25
This is really fucking cool, but can someone explain to me how this has come about?
I use blockchain as a Bitcoin wallet, also I have a Barclays account, how have these two things become interwoven?
I find it hard to believe that Barclays would support Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-12-06 19:28:20
Anyone know why Bitcoin-Central's GBP price per BTC is £10.91?
Everywhere else it is about £8.50 such as on MtGox.
@_date: 2012-09-21 15:21:51
This doesn't work, I've tried using it in Opera, Chrome and IE.
You type in an amount, then all you get is a blank screen.
Anyone got it working?
@_date: 2012-08-17 13:29:48
I agree, confidence plays a huge part the very 'idea' of something failing can effect its value.
@_date: 2013-01-27 16:37:04
ah, ok, ignore me
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:40:53
what the hell is going on!?
@_date: 2013-02-22 21:48:20
this shit is getting crazy
it's bound to drop and stabilize..i hope so because I sold at £19, bought at £3.30
@_date: 2013-01-18 19:47:15
wow thanks
@_date: 2013-03-05 22:55:37
i cashed out at £19, today at about £27
bought at £3.30 though
I'm honestly shocked at much it's risen
@_date: 2013-02-07 20:44:35
ironically MtGox has just crashed
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:56:47
anywhere in particular where you buy them from?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:11:04
It's actually too expensive for me to buy into now.
I bought at £3 and sold at about £25 earlier in the year..fuuuuu.
Any advise for a schmuck like me?
What's with micro bitcoin? Is that a smaller denomination to buy into now?
Help, advice, recipes?
