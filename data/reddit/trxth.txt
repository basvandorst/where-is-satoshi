Too bad Bitcoin is permissionless. Sure, the State can outlaw &amp; prosecute all of the btc users that it can catch, but all that does is drive the market underground / to alternate jurisdictions. Not to mention, the resources required to hunt down every crypto user not paying taxes would increase exponentially when more privacy options are available/utilized by the end-user, and for very little payoff.     
     
It's like the War on Drugs; if drugs were trafficked cryptographically through fiber optic cables across the globe in the matter of minutes.    
    
I do *somewhat* agree with your sentiment, but the solution won't (see: can't) be prohibition of - what is essentially - mathematics. Maybe citizens of the 21st Century would be more enticed to pay their taxes if the State didn't have such a bad reputation for wasting their hard-earned money and/or using it to further their own indoctrination?

Um, yes it does. LN will allow for a large percentage of transactions to take place off-chain, which means less congestion on-chain.     
     


     
Fewer transactions on-chain (because of LN) means lower on-chain fees.     
     


     
I don't know where you're getting "20$ fees" from? Fees in bitcoin are measured in satoshis/byte, not USD... At any rate, maybe you should get out of bitcoin until features such as LN are implemented? Until then, complaining about fees is a pretty big waste of everyone's time.

Being a mod - especially in this sub - is a thankless job at its best, and a futile effort at its worst (full-disclosure: I'm not a Mod, just a long-time observer).     
     
The main problem that I see is that it costs next-to-zero effort to shitpost/shill/troll, while it requires (a relatively) immense effort to fuel/engage-in a constructive/productive conversation online. Inevitably, the quality of the content gravitates towards the path of least resistance, and you get what you pay for...    
     
I applaud the mods here for keeping this "place" as civil as it *is*, but we must also recognize that this medium (aka- Reddit/[insert corporate-owned social media]) is not balanced in the mods'/our favor. In other words: the trolls will always win on this playing field.     
     
I'm not saying this to be a downer. If anything, it's a testament to the resilience of this movement (10-years and running...), but I think it's important that we remain vigilant in our pursuits. Just because We as the end-user/adopter have "seen the light", doesn't mean that we've magically changed the course of Human History (wouldn't that be awesome!?). Just ask anyone in this space that's tried to enlighten their friends/family and you'll quickly realize the kind of mass-hypnosis scenario that the Bitcoin-movement is up against.

Actually, if you still have the btc, you haven't actually lost anything. You only lose $200 if you exchange your btc for $200 less than you paid for it. The only logical reason to sell for less than you paid is if you think bitcoin will *never* be valued higher than it is today (or at least until you need the money, in which case you've probably invested more than you could afford to lose). And if that's the case then, by all means, sell and get out while you can. Wouldn't be my advise though...

You can "want to make some money" all you'd like, but nobody involved in this space cares what you want (I'm not saying that to be a dick, just to point out a truth that you seem to be ignoring).     
     
If you're here to make money, you need to gather up the necessary tools, work hard for it, and develop your skills just like *everyone else* who wants *the exact same thing*. Everyone here that understands Bitcoin is confident that the end result will be Mass Adoption™ (myself included), but we've still got a looooooong road ahead of us, with many hills and hurtles along the way.      
     
When you focus too much on the price, you lose sight of what this movement is really about. Your confidence will eventually fade (because it's detached from the *actual* value proposition of bitcoin), and you will inevitably be tricked into selling your bitcoin to one of the more patient &amp; dedicated among us when your *unrealistic expectations* are not met in whatever arbitrary time frame you've assigned to them.

I'm assuming you don't own a business, because any % of profit that isn't negative is money in the bank for that "company". Not to mention, there's a fixed amount of the remaining 99.4% of Square's bitcoin revenue in Q1 that went towards a one-time start-up cost of handling bitcoin (infrastructure, training employees, creating new procedures, etc.).

The network only stores transactions, but every transaction references a public key (or several) in their output, along with a set of parameters that tell the network which conditions must be met for the balance of the address to be spent. The network doesn't need to know about every address or key that's generated, only those with a transaction history (hence, the blockchain). The way the addresses are constructed is not random; the network can identify a valid vs. invalid transaction instantly (hence, the bitcoin protocol / consensus rules). The quantity of possible valid addresses is so massive that the odds of two people generating the same address twice is next-to zero.

Only in the sense that miners also run nodes. It's the nodes that "vote" on which block arrived first. Miners just mine blocks (and hope that they can broadcast them before the other miners beat them to it).

However, there's no guarantee that they would have found the same number of blocks had they been including transactions in them. Maybe they have a higher success rate mining empty blocks than they do mining non-empty blocks? In which case, how could anyone fault them for it?

BTC transactions are strictly "debit"-based (currently, and indefinitely). Just as USD or any fiat currency is at its base layer. 
     


     
This is a little misleading. Yes, they operate are two (or more) separate ledgers, but the purpose &amp; function of those ledgers are qualitatively &amp; functionally different (and shouldn't be compared in this context).     
     




     
Different than BTC, or different than Credit? We mustn't conflate the two.     
     




     
You can create BTC (debit) transactions "to the moon"? Sign me up!    
     




    
Credit is not a bearer asset. Your argument is trying to cram a square peg into a round hole...    
    
edit- To clarify: BTC is a Currency/Money; Credit is a Service/Debt. The world we live in (I'm talking about the 1st World) exists on the premise of debt (a.k.a.- borrowing from the future), so it makes sense when the lines get blurred in these types of discussions. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:56:29
You are correct, and I probably didn't get my point across very well. My main gripe is that, while Credit is absolutely compatible with BTC, comparing LN to Visa is comparing apples to oranges. The only time the comparison can be made is in the context of transaction throughput (and arguably, network stability). 
@_date: 2018-06-07 03:26:14
Now you're getting it! BTC is not about creating the new debt-based economy. It's not about eliminating the current debt-based economy, either. It's about removing the "debt-basedness" from the base layer. Humans will be human; Bitcoin just gives us an uncorruptible foundation for money.

Credit will *always* be a 2nd/3rd layer on top of *any* currency, *by definition*. If you want to borrow money, you have to create a placeholder unit by default. Just because we measure credit &amp; debit transactions by the same metric, doesn't mean that they are synonymous.

Does Visa hold USD in reserve to secure the entirety of their customers' credit usage at any point in time? I'm ignorant of the answer, but my guess is "no".     
     
I'd assume that a default on LN-issued credit would be handled in the same way that defaulting on your CC is handled by Visa; at the Creditor's discretion, your default would be reported to some sort of "credit bureau" and/or they would seek retribution through some sort of "debt collection agency" or litigation. In the end, the only difference (currently) is the legitimacy-status of Visa compared to LN.     
     
As long as LN can continue to prove its effectiveness &amp; efficiency in processing transactions as it scales over time, that legitimacy-status gap will shrink until we see some sort of "flippening" (lol). 
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:28:41
"You can't move USD on Visa's network that you don't have. How could credit work under such a system."

You're probably correct that that's what she was referring to, as it's a very common (yet ignorant) sentiment amongst bitcoin skeptics.

In your/her scenario, the business's "miners" and "nodes" would be 100% centralized, so they could do whatever they wanted, negating the whole point of using a blockchain in the first place.

While bitcoin is permissionless, it's probably safe to take the world's newborns, infants, toddlers, and young children out of the equation. So, let's start with 5 billion?     




     
It's possible to receive bitcoin and set up a LN channel in the same transaction, so we can cut that multiplier in half (you can double my end result if you want to also include closing transactions).    
     


     
Not sure what you're talking about with  Maybe you meant "channels" instead of "transactions"?     
     


     
...with our revised numbers, we get "1 transaction each... 5 billion transaction" 
     


     
3tps is an estimate based on legacy (non-segwit) transactions. With blocks containing 100% segwit transactions, that estimate climbs to 7-8tps. Let's call it 7.25.     
     


     
"690,000,000 seconds"     
     


     
"11,500,000 minutes

I agree with you there. In fact, that's essentially Bitcoin's thesis in regards to monetary policy.     
     


     
I'm not sure if such a system would *require* an engaged and knowledgeable population (although it would certainly help), just so long as the incentives are clear/transparent, meaningful, easily enforceable, and there was some mechanism to verify consensus among all of the participants (did somebody say, "utopia"?). The real tough part would be transitioning to this new system from where we are now. Once you're there, though, this "perfect system" should sustain itself based on the game theory in its design.     
     


     
You and me both! However, do you believe that all efforts that aim to dream-up such a system are fruitless?

In your first scenario, all bets are off, and bitcoin's success or failure would be the least of anyone's worries (not to mention, all other forms of money would likely suffer the same fate).   
    
In your second scenario, you fail to acknowledge bitcoin's plasticity and its penchant for adaptation. While an event such as you propose is possible - and would undoubtedly be catastrophic to the ecosystem and public perception for some time - I can't imagine a single bug or hack that couldn't be mitigated against with proper developer and community response. Bitcoin is anti-fragile, after all.

To add to this, more hashrate means that more miners (and/or more efficient miners) are actively participating in the process of validating blocks (where all of the transactions are stored/recorded), which in turn helps to secure the network (by making it more robust against certain types of attacks).

I'm not sure how that would change anything, but yes, I assumed we were basing these figures off of [the value/buying-power of $1M USD today] as opposed to [$1M USD in a future where hyperinflation has made USD worthless].     
     
A more meaningful adjustment to your logic might be something like "the odds of 1btc = $1.00 is &gt; the odds of 1btc = $1M", because $1.00/btc is still infinitely more likely than $1M/btc.

Every economic philosophy you've listed strives to achieve a balance between its citizens' personal sovereignty vs. the ability of the power structure to maintain the status quo. None of these *philosophies* are about "enriching the few at the expense of the many", as you put it. However, *in practice*, there are too many ways to game each system, and as a result, those with the knowhow and/or ruthlessness will inevitably fight their way to the top of the hierarchy (and fight to stay there as long as possible). It's not that the philosophies themselves are designed to be corrupted; it's the destructive nature of human greed, and our inability to create a system that cannot be co-opted by the greedy and powerful among us.

Tech like this goes waaaaay over most people's heads, unfortunately. Heck, the simple premises of "what *is* money" and "what *is* governance" go over way too many people's heads. It's not their fault really; the knowledge isn't super accessible through conventional educational means. But the ignorance of the masses is currently bitcoin's greatest hurtle to overcome. Because once you really, truly understand the implications of this technology, it's pretty obvious that the legacy system(s) of society are dinosaurs at their best, and demons at their worst.

That's not how any of this works. All that a 51% attack can hope to achieve is to censor transactions temporarily, and at an exponentially increasing monetary cost to the attacker. If they become too much of a nuisance, *the community* could/would fork the main chain, change-up some hash functions, and render the attacker's entire investment completely useless practically overnight. Would it be detrimental in the short-term? Yes, most likely. Would it be catastrophic long-term? Bitcoin is called anti-fragile for a reason.

Okay, point(s) taken. I admit that the toll road analogy isn't the best for getting my point across...    
    
I'm mostly trying to highlight the fact that "spamming" the blockchain has *much higher* associated costs than email spamming. The "spammer" has to compete financially with the entirety of the network, and will undoubtedly lose money in the long term. Whereas the email spammer is paying for a service where the costs are not directly proportional to the world-wide email usage statistics. The effects on the network, nodes, and end-user are drastically different, and the costs, motives, and payouts for the instigator are also drastically different.    
    


     
I'm honestly not just trying to argue semantics here. I think the differences are vast enough that using the same word to describe both types of "spam" can lead to inaccurate conclusions.

The difference is that email spam does not have a cost associated with it like blockchain spam does. If somebody wants to waste money by paying miners to include their "worthless" transactions in a block, I'm not sure if I'd call that spam since they must pay the cost to do so.    
    
An analogy might be an owner of a private highway employing a team of drivers to drive up-and-down the public freeway all day in order to incentivise honest drivers to commute on their toll roads. Sure, it's a nuisance - and could probably fairly be called "malicious" or "unethical" - but would you call that "spam traffic"?    
    
I'd be more in favor of calling them "nuisance" transactions, or "fluff" transactions, rather than "spam" transactions.

This happens during nearly all major price fluctuation. The movement in price triggers people to send their btc to exchanges, withdraw their btc from exchanges, transfer their btc to/from their hot/cold wallets, etc. Once the novelty of the market movement wears off, the mempool will decrease and your low-fee transaction will find its way into a block (or maybe sooner, if you're lucky).

Technically, it's the inflation rate that is cut in half, not the supply. The supply would be the number of coins available for trade on the market.

I wouldn't say "clueless", just an innocent misuse of the terminology. I think OP understands the concept, but I just wanted to clarify the semantics to avoid any confusion (i.e.- a noob that might conclude that the *supply* would literally be cut in half).

Except you would say "there are 120-trillion pennies in $1.2-trillion dollars". The values are equal; you're just adjusting the decimal placement to define a different base unit-of-measure.     
     
If the value of $1USD increased by 100x in the future for some reason (just humor me on this one) - so now $1USD(future) has the purchasing power of $1000USD(current) in today's value - the value of a penny would be the equivalent of $1USD(current). In this hypothetical, it would force the USD(future) to come up with a new coin to represent fractions of a penny, since we would still need to exchange money for things that cost less than $1USD(current).    
    
Hope that makes sense. It's a difficult concept to articulate :/

Trading btc for goods, services, or another crypto is considered a taxable event in the US. Only way to avoid a taxable event after buying btc in the US is to hodl it. After a year it falls under long-term capital gains, but it's still money owed to the IRS (percentage owed may vary depending on your tax bracket).

This isn't really accurate. An account on MtGox holding a lot of btc was hacked. Due to withdrawal limits on the hacked account, the hacker dumped as much of the btc in the account that they could for $0.01/btc, triggering all of the buy orders on the exchange to get filled. This *artificially* caused the price of btc to go to one cent until all of those $0.01 sell orders were filled. I don't belive you would have seen this price drop if you were monitoring any other exchange at the time (which there were a few). 
     
In the end, MtGox rolled everyone's account balances back to before the hack, so nobody actually got to keep their $0.01 bitcoins. Almost like it never happened at all...

 - "Redditor for 2 weeks"    
     
I can't be the only one that's noticed these kinds of comments being posted all over this sub lately, and nearly all of them are from &lt; 2 month old accounts (mostly just a few days / weeks). Did these "Redditors" all just happen to independently create their accounts within the last month or two just to rub the downtrend in our faces / spread FUD? Or is there something more nefarious going on?     
     
My guess is that it's a mix of both, but mostly the latter. I know there are plenty of skeptics out there who have been itching for the chance to say "I told you so" to the greater crypto community, but that doesn't explain all of the "bitcoin is going down to [insert low number here]" comments. It's too bad we don't have any way of proactively weeding out trolls/shills/fudsters. I try to report them to the mods whenever I see them, but it's a losing battle due to the fact that it costs nothing to create an account on Reddit. Maybe accounts with an age less than a year shouldn't be able to comment here at all, but that would obviously exclude all of the well-intentioned noobs. Not sure if there's any good solution, but I can see why the quality of the discussions on this sub have declined so much in the past year or so.

I don't disagree with you that we *may* never see $100,000 &lt;= bitcoin, but your reasoning is flawed in some parts, and downright wrong in others.    
    


There is no "issue" with burnt coins. Since bitcoin is permissionless, anyone is free to do whatever they'd like with their own money. That includes destroying it; for whatever reason they may have. In fact, there are altcoins that operate on this very principal by [using "proof-of-burn" to mine coins] ( The only effect that it has on the rest of the network is that it could potentially *increase* the value - by *decreasing* the supply - of all unburnt coins.     
    


Not true, that's what [m-of-n mulisignature transactions] ( are for.    
    


What does SHA2 have to do with bitcoin?    
    


And yet, bitcoin has some of the best software developers in the world maintaining it and improving the code.     
    


    
The EDA is not a crack in bitcoin; it's a "feature" of an altcoin that forked off of bitcoin's blockchain. And the "block reward" and "halvenings" that you mention are fundamental to the entire concept that *is* Bitcoin. They are the methods by which the coins are "minted" and inflation is regulated, respectively.     
     


    
Bitcoin is designed in such a way that incentivises decentralization. While no amount of centralization can really be said to be "good" for the network, [I don't think we have any reason to worry about a 51% attack] ( The attack would be expensive, and obvious to the users being attacked, who could quickly and easily reach a consensus that the attacker's chain is invalid and change the protocol to reflect that. As more people and businesses enter the bitcoin space, we'll start to see the system trend more and more towards decentralization.    
     


    
This is a feature, not a bug. A project like bitcoin is going to take a lot of time to grow and adapt to the rate of adoption. Just because *you* are impatient and self-entitled enough to demand for progress **now**, doesn't change the fact that it takes time to roll out a competent, secure, and well-tested change to the the network that *also* requires the consensus of **the entire Bitcoin network** in order to be even considered safe in the first place. If you want rapid updates and quick (aka- cenralized) decisions making, maybe you'd be better off in the EDA-backed shitcoin mentioned earlier...     
     


... oh wait, it seems you're actually a shill for said shitcoin. Go figure.   
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:52:12


     
The "drama" was the result of the attempted (but failed) hostile takeover of the Bitcoin brand, development, and community by a vocal minority of bad/misled actors. Any decentralized cryptocurrency - or for that matter, any technology where money/power is involved - that achieves a meaningful level of adoption would be prone to this kind of attack. Not all of them would show the same kind of resilience that Bitcoin has. 
     


     
Improvements are thoroughly vetted and require consensus to be implemented. Replace "Improvements" with "Attacks", and "conflict of interest" with "consensus requirements". As the saying goes: it's a feature, not a bug. 
     


     
So what? Bitcoin isn't interesting because it's a digital coin. We already live in a world full of digital tokens. Rewards points, gift cards, in-game currency, etc. What makes the "2.x and 3.x generations" coins that you mention interesting? Are they more decentralized than bitcoin? Or more secure? Do they solve any real-world problems better than Bitcoin? Higher quality developers? Bigger community? Longer track record of resisting attacks? Media coverage? I could keep going, but I can already tell you the answer is *D) None of the above*.

@_date: 2019-02-18 19:55:25
No offense, but that sounds like a terrible idea. Just a few issues off the top of my head:    
    
1) How would you bootstrap/enforce this currency? There would be no way to distribute it like you suggest without getting a State entity involved, and there goes the "trustless, decentralized, censorship-resistant" qualities (aka- the whole point of crypto/btc in the first place) out the window.    
    
2) How would you value this currency? Bitcoin's and other cryptos' value have been determined by the free market. Everyone with bitcoin had to trade it for something of value (obviously ignoring any stolen/gifted btc here). If you distribute 1 "worldCoin" to everyone on the planet, there is no price history to base a valuation off of. It would be nearly impossible without (again) having to bring in a State actor to enforce the value and/or "back" the currency with another asset or currency, which defeats the point (again).    
    
3) Forget  and  for a moment, and let's pretend everyone on the planet now has 1 of these "worldCoins". What are you doing with everyone's money/assets that they had before this new currency was distributed? Did we confiscate everyone's USD, precious metals, real estate, etc., and torch them, or divvy them up to the population of the world as well? If not, aren't the rich still rich and the poor still poor? Wealth isn't just a number balance in a bank account.    
    
I don't have time to list any more flaws with your argument, but that should be enough to show how impractical something like that would be. Maybe there's a counter-argument that I'm not privy to, in which case I'd be glad to hear it. Otherwise, let's abandon the whole "evenly distributed cryptocurrency for the whole world" notion. It causes way more problems than it sets out to fix. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:03:53
Yes, but the vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it costs the spammer money to ddos the network. If the spammer is a miner, they may be able to recuperate some of their losses by mining a block that returns transaction fees in that block (plus the block reward) back to them, but if another miner finds the block(s) first, then the attacker's spam-funds become a net loss for them. Therefore, a ddos attack becomes riskier/more costly for the attacker the longer they keep it up.

My theory: This is a new FUD campaign (just hear me out)...     
     
The current FUD campaign (claiming "BCH is the real Bitcoin") is coming to an end. Even if the calls for a class action lawsuit against bitcoin.com's fraudulent nature don't pan out, the community has been vocal enough to put a huge damper on their efforts. But let's remember one very important thing about the ones we know as "The Others(ub)": Call them what you may, but they can take a beating 'til they're black &amp; blue, and yet they have always lived to fight another day (albeit with a re-imagined "face", and a completely different fighting style). 
     
My hypothesis: This new campaign is an attempt to make the r/bitcoin community look petty, mean, and immature (and in effect, causing newbies to venture over to the Others(ub) to see what they're all about (a.k.a.- bad publicity is better than no publicity). 
     
This attempt is sneaky, and I've got to hand it to them: *Smart*! Not only will they have their own legions of shills to upvote these posts to the Front Page of r/bitcoin; there will also be a vast number of "true" r/bitcoin subscribers helping them along just to spite the Others(ub) (and ironically, their/our own face). Think about it: if you were a n00b, ignorant to the reasons behind the BTC vs BCH debacle, and you went over to the BTC side only to see the Front Page filled with these kinds of posts, you'd probably go over to the Others(ub) based *solely* on the childish &amp; borderline-bullying nature of this shit!        
    
Why do **We** need to be wasting our time &amp; effort with that *fucking obvious* shitcoin? **We** have Segwit, LN, and much more tech that's just around the corner! **We** have *the best of the best* developers working on the protocol. **We** have a 9+ year track record and a **$7.5-Billion** market cap! And most importantly, **We** don't have to worry about our project failing as a result of anything other than a failure of the the base technology.     
     
Let me remind all of those misguided r/bitcoin subscribers that are still upvoting this shit: We/You do not need to stoop to the level of insults &amp; smearing. Bitcoin can stand *just fine* on its own two feet. Do you see any other "coin" out there that's trying to do the same thing that We are? And no, I'm not talking about no-fee&amp;instant-confirmation payments (most existing payment methods already offer this) and I'm not talking about BigGains&amp;Lambos (which are definitely **NOT** mentioned in Satoshi's Visionary Paper of Whitefulness).    
    
If you understand the technology and its ramifications, then there is no need to spend another minute thinking about the Others(ub). They can have 80% market share for all I care; it will never change the fact that their "technology" is at best a cheap knock-off, and at worst a fraud.

But the value of Bitcoin is immutably tied to the value that all of Us (collectively) give to it (in the same way that cash, or any other currency/commodity, is valuated). I believe in Bitcoin, so I don't sell/trade/exchange it for any amount of fiat/goods/services that I could (currently) redeem it for; instead, I hold onto it until the Community agrees to trade at a rate that I deem appropriate... but I also realize that my own biases have very little effect on the "agreed-upon" "value" of this digital asset.

Therefore, it (bitcoin) will increase in value until its value reaches a particular threshold where owners/hodlers start to believe that it's "over-valued" (...and judging by this sub (and my own confidence in said commodity/currency), the potential value is moon-or-bust).

"Bitcoin Core" is *free* client software, so... nobody?

Exactly; I think we're in agreement. If I say "the value of one (1) bitcoin is equal to the value of one (1) house", then that is (technically) the value of one (1) bitcoin (at the time of transaction). However, the Community's consensus could easily overrule my personal valuation at any given moment...

Hi, and thanks for your generosity! 
E: and BTW, my mom works for a non-profit, do you have an opinion on the best/easiest way for them to start accepting Bitcoin donations? (I'm still a Bitcoin noob)

Yes, but ideally the "bank" would be transparent and accountable for your funds. They might take custody of your keys, but you would be able to check the blockchain to verify that nobody is tampering with your funds without your consent.     
     
Sure, you might still get a loan from a bank, but the funds would come from willing participants who have agreed for the bank to use their funds to invest in you (probably in exchange for a cut of the interest you'd owe on top of the loan), and couldn't be fractionally reserved (not without the use of some sort of sidechain or altcoin, anyways).     
     
I don't know if it's even accurate to call it a bank at that point, but I can't think of a better term at the moment.

In order to change the block time (without a contentious hard fork), you would need to essentially gain consensus from the entire network. Hard forks are risky, so you need to make sure that everyone is on board before even thinking of attempting one. Otherwise you'd end up with a two different coins and a big mess of a situation. There's just not a good enough reason (as of yet) to change this parameter with all of the risk that it would entail. And there are many security trade-offs that you'd be making by reducing or increasing the difficulty adjustment time frame.

Rule  Not your keys; not your coins   
    
...but yes, keeping your btc balance to yourself is also an important rule to live by ;)

Miners don't control the consensus rules, users do.

That's like... the opposite of punk. More like "paint it on the side of the Capital Building" or "burn it into your forearm"!

The miners get *paid* to "incur the cost", as you put it. They actually make a profit from it. And the "real work" that they do is nothing more than ordering transactions &amp; trying to guess random numbers quicker than the other miners.   
And the nodes - and the code they run - is exactly what "matters much for security" in Bitcoin.    
It's almost as if you're here to spread misinformation. Hmm...

If the developers made this kind of change without consensus, their reputation would be destroyed and nobody would run their software. Even if they collude with the miners, they would all be forked off the network and their new chain would be worthless.
