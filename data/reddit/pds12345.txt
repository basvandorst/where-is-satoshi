I bought my whole family like .2 Bitcoin for Christmas few years back and put it on paper wallets... Hope they still have it. :3

So I'm confused by the whole coin base thing. I have used coin base for years, but I have had my coins in a separate wallet when they did this switch to Bitcoin-XT thing I've heard about.
Does this mean when I am using coinu base I am no longer buying /selling bitcoin? But rather an alternative?
If it's an altcoin, how is the price on coin base still reflect that on other markets for bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:26:43
Yeah I first discovered it at $30 a pop, bought like 3/4 and spent them and watched it break $1000 like 6 months later.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:04:36
This clears things up a lot. Thank you for your input!

What kind of work do you do where you are paid in BTC? What other types of jobs pay out in BTC
@_date: 2015-12-17 03:22:57
I gave my whole family bitcoin for Christmas a couple years ago and printed out paper wallets for the each of em

I think that plays and/or will play into its volatility too... If it's a known money supply it might make it more stable.
Shot in the dark here though

Just start with a low.limit and but again when you can. It won't be long before your limit is more than you could want to buy.
I made my coin base account in 2012 and my limit is in the thousands now.

But I thought there were only 15/16 million in circulation or something.
@_date: 2016-03-02 16:59:04
Just started like 4/5 days ago.

But only ~.1 mb of spam needs to be created.
If it was increased to 2mb then they would potentially pay half the fee for a larger amount of spam. So they would potentially have to pay for .5 mb of spam at half fee price. Thereby increasing their expenditure by about 250%
Any who. I like the sound of between a 4mb and 10mb increase. Provides room for growth over the next years

You don't have a contract when using bitcoin. You are thinking it more of a stock than you are of a currency.
You can give or receive bitcoin for services. The market you are using to buy bitcoin is essential the same as trading your USD for Euro or vice verse.
Different markets may have different buying and selling limits. For instance coinbase starts you out at a $50 limit I believe, but over time you might be able to increase your limit to thousands of dollars.
If you are having an issue with hitting a limit you could look into using more than one market.
Hope this helps.

I pay 6 cents of tax when I buy something 99 cents. Progress.

We don't all print money. Same ways you get money.
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:00:38
Ah I understand now. Thank you
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:50:50
Exactly my point!
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:12:46
The same ways as everyone else....?
I can work for USD and I can work for BTC. I can barter things with either. ect. It's another currency, you can obtain it through the same means as every other currency. And we all get in one way or another, some of us the same some of us different.

It should go through eventually. Just might take a long while.
And if it doesn't after like three days it should be refunded.
@_date: 2016-06-09 15:29:29
thanks man

Hes nearly made it 6 already! Whats 10 more.

Although this guy was able to get into mining in 2009, I wish I would have when I first learned about it in ~2012.
I remember mining bitcoin and litecoin, but BTC was only like 20/25 dollars a piece, and I didn't have too good of hardware to do that well, so I stopped.
Now I wish I would have held out :(
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:15:27
I've been watching bitcoin for ~four years now. If there is anything i've learned is that even though it is so sporadic week to week, it just keeps going up.
Holding is the only way to keep bitcoin.

He is still active in bitcoin subreddits too.

Have you looked at the app, Circle?
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:45:32
I started the game at $25.
I own none currently. Kms
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:26:42
I concur
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:23:20
I agree with this sentiment. Yeah, to a degree you see it coming and everyone knows what to expect. But that doesn't discount the fact that the supply is going down, all while bitcoin has gradually been gaining popularity over years now. I think it makes sense that in the couple months after this halving the price would bubble before correcting down.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:23:56
And the price grew 90x
Edit: bubbled 90x
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:32:51
 Damn. I wish I could afford 2 bitcoins a day.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:37:55
I bought my whole family 20$ worth of Bitcoin on a paper wallet years ago, bout the first time it hit $1000. They were also interested when I told them that $20 was worth $200 at one point . None of them ever learned to transfer it out of the wallets though.
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:32:27
chill. I've used coinbase for years with no problems.
Sometimes my buys will say it will come in 5 business days or so, and it won't arrive until late on the fifth day.
Verify all your stuff and use their instant buys if you can, I'll get my bitcoin instantly and be charged in a few days.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:36:59
Awesome, that makes more sense now. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:40:17
Honestly, that is fucked up and if I told my mother that happened, she would already be threatening a lawsuit towards the school.
Edit: I suppose it it probably a private school after rereading, but still, talk to someone higher up about it with your parents.

Well, a teacher was racist towards me once and she was prepared to file one (she works in a lawfirm aswell)... so it would not take much at this point.
But this is discrimination none the less.

So what you are saying is when all coins have been generated, the rewards will be from transaction fees?
