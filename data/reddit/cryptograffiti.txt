According to MSM, Bitcoin has died a hundred times over. This shirt is only available for purchase with Bitcoin.  Thus, buying it after a supposed death demonstrates the reporter is wrong.  
I envision it as a rally cry of sorts, wherein the wearer tweets photos of the newly btc-purchased shirt in protest of the misinformation being spread.

Timechain  is the third in a series of new works.  It was made in collaboration w/ Blockplate whose seed storage device received an "A Rating" by Jameson Lopp after a series of extreme stress tests.
Blockplate customized an 18x36" version of their stainless steel product to serve not only as the artwork’s backing but as storage for 1 BTC.
After receiving the plate, I punched a series of indentations corresponding with a 24 word seed phrase which will recover the BTC.
These markings were then buried under primer, metallic paint, the fiat currency and lastly a coat of resin. 
Should the owner lose faith in bitcoin, my career or have some other rationale for needing access to the funds, they may do so by destroying the artwork. 
However if they remain patient, the owner can preserve both the artwork and the bitcoin as every year on Oct. 30th, I will reveal one word from the seed phrase to them. The first word "model" is being revealed publicly.
If I die before the 24 years transpires, theoretically that should increase the value of the art so we’ll call it a wash. All three Timechain pieces are currently auctioning on [Bitify](

I'm familiar with both.  Division meaning since companies aren't on the same page re: using a standard, smaller denomination, it hasn't spread.  And because it hasn't spread there are countless people who haven't gotten into btc for fear of it being too expensive or that they missed the boat.

Three weeks ago, this [post]( revealed Coinkite is using stickers of Dorian to help sell their products.
I spoke with Dorian and he confirmed that he is in no way affiliated with this company. In his words, he does not want to be associated with Coinkite because they did not ask for his participation and "in the event they wrong their customers."
I reached out to Coinkite on Reddit and Twitter. Before blocking me, they stated the stickers were two years old and therefore "this is nothing new."
They also [sell the stickers](
Considering what Dorian has been through, it goes without saying that this publicity is unwelcome. 
Coinkite, if you agree to cease these activities, I will delete this post.

Dorian's stance may have been different had they not been selling the stickers as well as posting images of their product as his genitalia.  We tried to resolve this privately, but those responses were less classy.

I think this too easily dismisses the need to bring more people into Bitcoin.  If a concerted marketing effort drives more people to buy bitcoin resulting in more businesses being asked to accept bitcoin then more people will spend.

Are we supposed to discount the study entirely because it was published by Facebook?  There were 27,000 polled.  Facebook is already in the payments space and will do whatever they can to maintain a young user base.  This is actually good news.

Well said, Alistair.  As someone involved with Bitcoin guerrilla marketing efforts, I think about this often.  
Unfortunately, marketing is one of the areas where decentralization hurts us.  Finding consensus on the message, look and feel of Bitcoin is a challenge.  And differing opinions re: where to allocate our efforts could result in eight underfunded projects with little impact vs. one slam dunk.
Another challenge is the lack of creatives in our space. Exhibit A: Bitcoin's most main-stage marketing effort to date - the Bitpay [spots]( which aired on ESPN.    
Two of the commercials are the video equivalent of stock photography and I'll respectfully decline to comment on the third.  
All of the above being said, I still agree that crowdfunding is the way to go.  It's in our blood.  Currently, there aren't any reputable platforms that accept Bitcoin.  Who will step up and help build one?
We are nothing short of a revolution.  We need to sell the future.  I have a big hairy goal of directing a Bitcoin SuperBowl ad.  I've produced videos that have garnered XXMM views online and I want to help.

This is an excerpt from a recent interview I did with CCN who asked, "Why is Dorian Nakamoto an important figure in Bitcoin?" 
CG: There is considerable negativity within our community and recent controversies such as the block chain debate have unfortunately divided us. The outpouring of support for Dorian during the Newsweek fiasco shows that when the rubber meets the road, we help one another. We came together to right a wrong.  Mainstream media was attempting to profit from nefarious actions. Many would argue that Bitcoin was founded based on similar principles.  
The interview in its entirety can be read [here](
What said is correct.  This is less hype and more a show of support as Dorian is not doing well financially.

Hi r/bitcoin,  
I am the artist who made the work featured in yesterday's Bitcoin Magazine [article]( on Dorian Nakamoto.  
Some of you have seen my graphic/street art on this subreddit.  I am now beginning to show a series of fine art.  The proceeds of this piece will go to my friend Dorian who has signed the work.
If you are interested acquiring the art, we are auctioning it via sealed bids to info  This is also the address for any questions you may have. The auction will run until October 15th, 2015 at 7pm PST. 
Also, Dorian's AMA will be next week, not this week as referenced in the article.

Hey everyone,
Yesterday I auctioned this piece to the lowest bidder to help promote the lightning network and poke fun at MSM's focus on Bitcoin's price. 
This [video]( shows its creation and miniscule dimensions.
The promise of micropayments was instrumental in my becoming an artist in the space. In 2012, I first read about the idea of combatting email spam/DDOS attacks by charging negligible amounts of money to send messages/login. These were the first creative use cases I had heard for cryptocurrency. It inspired me to think of ways micropayments could benefit artists. And in 2013 I began posting street art around the San Francisco Bay Area/Pacific NW with a public facing wallet so passersby could send small amts of bitcoin if they liked the work.
I’m excited about a future where micropayments are omnipresent. Artists paid by the view…writers by the poem…musicians by the listen. Every day interactions complemented by positive monetary reinforcement such as tipping someone who let you merge into traffic.
Hopefully this micro auction inspires others to think big about the future of Bitcoin.
Big shout out to [ for helping me get set up with Lightning Charge's nanotip!

 Talked to 1K+ people new to BTC while exhibiting work recently. Large majority were unaware of divisibility. It's a huge adoption barrier.
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:37:38
Coin banks have been around since the 2nd century B.C., with the oldest known example being found in the ancient Greek colony, Priene (now Turkey). Since these money boxes pre-dated banks, they were a common way to store currency at home.
I wanted to create an updated version of the coin bank using modern manufacturing and design techniques.
Coin ฿ank is 3D printed in porcelain. It features a sand-blasted design filled with cobalt blue acrylic.
The bank includes a laser-engraved cork customized with the owner's QR code. This code is meant to allow for the virtual deposit of cryptocurrency - the future of money.
Coin ฿ank is a limited edition of 10. It will always cost one bitcoin. Only bitcoin is accepted.
Your purchase includes a certificate of authenticity which has been permanently registered on the blockchain.

Agreed on both points.  Too close to bitcoin but all the alternative names have their drawbacks but IMO, a one syllable catchy name trumps the other options.

*black swan* is up for bid until 7pm EST at [cryptograffiti.auction](
The catch is that it will go to the lowest bidder.
Bids will be live streamed as they come in [here](  
I created black swan for two reasons:
1. To poke fun at MSM's focus on Bitcoin’s price instead of the groundbreaking technology being built
2.  To help spread awareness about the lightning network

Yeah.  Just pointing out it isn't new. TBH, I think the biggest hurdle is just getting everyone on the same page.  Some big time exchanges and wallet providers are already in favor of bits.

Thanks for the comment.  When determining where to place the QR, the cork won out for a couple reasons.  
1.  IMO, QR codes are ugly and making it visible would have resulted in a less aesthetically pleasing piece.
2.  Having the QR code on the cork allows for easier interchangeability should one decide to use a different wallet.
