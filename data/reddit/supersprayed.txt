This. I went back and forth with my bank multiple times due to some BS overdraft charges(bank fees I was charged that I shouldn’t have been charged that caused me to overdraw) and they never even offered to disable OD protection. I learned on here I could request the “feature” be disabled. They won’t tell you they can take it off, assholes.

Oh yes. You are 100% correct. 100% of all people not already involved don’t care. Because google says so, right? 
You heard it here first folks, nobody outside of crypto will ever care about bitcoin from this day forward. No more money is coming in to bitcoin ever again. Time to sell!

That chart looks very similar to the price of bitcoin over the last 5 years. 
That being said, how does the amount of google search results determine that it is now out of favor? Because not as many people now are googling the term? It spiked in December from like $5,000 up to $20,000 so yeah, more people were inclined to see what all the fuss was about and your graph is now tapering off to pre-boom levels, which the price is also doing(who’d have thought one affected the other). Wait a year then run your google search result again and the chart will most likely look the same, steady for the last 4 years then a spike around December-January. 
Most people somewhat involved in crypto don’t google search bitcoin. Those google searches are for the people that have never heard about it and saw some fake internet money went 4x in a month and wanted to know what was up. You should check the trading volume to determine what is in and or if favor.

At least until when it growsagain? 
That’s kind of the trend with a lot of things if you pay attention....
Hey guess what? Basketball google search trends spike during March, that doesn’t mean there is no interest the rest of the year. Still not sure how google trends = interest of 100% of the general public either. 
I’m kind of confused at your argument. I don’t care about every community I’m not involved in, that doesn’t make said communities irrelevant.
