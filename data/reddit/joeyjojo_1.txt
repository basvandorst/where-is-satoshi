Do you mean "every citizen pays taxes"? Because that's not true.
Next is: Who will maintain the roads?!
UAE has roads. So does Monaco. So does Qatar. So does the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Maldives, Saudi Arabia, and British Virgin Islands. All these places have a maximum income tax rate of 0%. They have low payroll taxes, and no corporate tax.
They also have police systems, fire response systems, and other socialist programs that help them function as a society.
In contrast, the UK has a max tax rate of 45% on income, a 20% VAT on purchases, a max Nat'l insurance tax of 25.8%, and a corporate tax rate of 20%. They also charge council tax, road tax, rubbish tax, and the list goes on. Never in my life, in all the countries I've lived, have I been taxed as much as I was when I lived in the UK, the world's middlemen for centuries.

Fortunately, no!
All joking aside, why did you assume that?

That means most people could buy a 60,000-75,000 pound flat in London.. 
Anybody see anything in that price range?
[Wait.. How much?!](

I'm sorry, but you don't know what you're saying. You should be a bit more skeptical of what you read when it comes to what's going on in China.

Aside from buying things online, what do people "use" bitcoin for in small towns in United States, Canada, United Kingdom, or any other country for that matter?

Take a look in to "cashless societies". Sweden and India come to mind as being on the forefront of this development.
Cashless societies are less prone to tax evasion, money laundering, and crime which is dealt in with cash.
There are some interesting podcasts on the matter, including an excellent freakonomics about India eliminating the equivalent of the $100 note.

I don't know why people keep saying today that Bitcoin is illegal in China. It's not. It's totally fine for individuals to use bitcoin here, and there are multiple websites which allow the trade of it from CNY. 
Businesses, however, are not allowed to use BTC.

I don't think that's true. I don't believe Bitcoin can even handle the capacity it's under at the moment... OP said if they were to convert two of the largest companies in the world, Bitcoin wouldn't have the capacity.
Bitcoin can handle fewer than ten transactions a second... The technology hasn't scaled to the requirement, and the Mom and Pop store mentioned in this thread is going to realise that once somebody tries to pay using bitcoin and the transaction doesn't confirm for an inappropriate amount of time.

Bitcoin can't handle the volume without any more users/use cases, nevermind Walmart and Amazon!
