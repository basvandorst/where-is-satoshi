Instead of trying to be a clever ass hole why don’t you just answer the valid question? Value is given to bitcoin because it’s essentially USD or Gold but for the age of the internet. Before USD the standard of fiscal value was gold and before that it was food or supplies. After the majority of people no longer valued the trade of food/supplies, we used a new way of measuring value and that is where the gold standard came from. After time and periods of financial evolution we realized how inefficient Gold was to store and trade. That’s when bank notes came into play and those notes acted as a middle man between gold bars and the act of purchasing. Through time we ended up with USD that is currently being propped up by the gold standard. With that being said the next evolution of banking is here and our value placed digitally. It’s all about efficiency and evolution of currency and making sure that our source of value lines up with our current place in society. If we live in a digital age it only makes sense to use digital currency. Plus the only thing stopping crypto from being used earlier was the double spend issue that basically ensured the need for a physical middle man aka financial institutions. Gilman Sachs, Rothschild, JP Morgan, etc are the richest entities today because of where they stood when the switch from gold to USD really started taking affect. That’s why they have transcended to where they are today. The financial systems were put in place early to influence the system from the start. Thanks for listening to my rant and I hope I answered your question! Keep HODLing!!
