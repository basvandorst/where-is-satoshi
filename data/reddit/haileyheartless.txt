I hope someone can help me out here, this is a 101 question. 
I'm a sex worker and I use crypto currency for my work. I know how to do everything using my cellphone and my wallet and I've become pretty savvy at it. I've been asked by a nonprofit to give a workshop on crypto currency for sex workers, and I want to make it accessible, so I want to teach them how to use a paper bitcoin wallet because some of the attendees might not have cell phones.
I know how to make a wallet on blockchain.info, how to make a paper wallet at a bitcoin atm, and how to scan the private key and sweep the paper wallet, but I'm hung up on the idea of importing a wallet, specifically I've read that if you import a wallet and spend part of the bitcoin, the entire wallet is depleted. Where does that bitcoin go? Will it still be available for the user with the blockchain.info wallet, or will it be gone forever?
So far I'm planning to just tell attendees to just sweep their paper wallets and destroy them, but I heard that importing can have a benefit by allowing money to be sent to the public key, then having it immediately available on the wallet. This might be helpful for girls who maybe only get 20 minutes of computer time at a library or drop in centre, so they can get in, post their ad on a website, then leave. It also means that they don't have to type or scan the private key every time, which exposes them to potential keylogging attacks. It can also be difficult to type it in every time if you're disabled or addicted to substances.
If anyone can help me out here in plain English it would be much appreciated.
