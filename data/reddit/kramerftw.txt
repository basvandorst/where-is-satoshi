Well I have already done all of that, I am just wondering if anyone knows if there is a potential for some sort of BIOS or hardware virus that could in theory keep info stored on the BIOS/HW and then when I go back to the online computer, it could upload it through the internet

This applies across all business deductions. I did not state you could claim the entire cost. Anyone filing taxes should be competent enough to go read and know how much of a deduction they can take.

Ok, first off it is up to you for the burden of proof. If you have bitcoin A in your wallet that you got for $20 and you spend bitcoin B on whatever, you do not have to claim gains of $500. Lets say I want to buy a $50 ring from you. I go on Coinbase and buy $50 in bitcoin and send it to you. I do not pay taxes on that. If anything I lost money because I paid the fees from Coinbase and the .0001 fee to send you the BTC.
Second, any transaction under $600 does not have to be reported so everything you just said is... asinine.

But the burden of proof of the value of an asset is bared by the taxpayer, not the IRS. If you send in back up, they can audit you but it will prove them wrong.

This is not a retroactive rule or law. This is simply the interpretation of the existing tax law, the one that has been in place, by the IRS.
They did not change the rules or the law. A lot of people, the ones who do not want their bank accounts frozen or their wages garnished, have been paying taxes and filing bitcoin income for a few years. If these rules are different from the way the tax payer interpreted it, then they simply have to amend their refund for the last three years (statute of limitations on tax returns) to follow this interpretation. That could be beneficial to some, who may get a bigger return, or it may  mean they have to pay a little more.

But what I am saying is, false.

You can report a loss of the $100, plus any fees incurred for the transactions.

I am not being paranoid, I am being safe. It is one thing to deposit money in a bank that is backed by the FCID, it is another to go invest a lot of money in something that could be fairly easily stolen, given the right person is looking for it.

Any transaction made with bitcoin is now considered a transfer of property. If you buy $600 in coffee from Starbucks with bitcoin, you have to report that transfer of property.
Lets say the bitcoin was mined when it was $1 and now it is $600. You buy the $600 of coffee and you have a capital gain of $599. However, you can deduct electricity cost and mining hardware cost if you mined it. If you bought it off Coinbase or something, you owe the entire tax on $599 in capital gains.
"Examples of payments of fixed and determinable income include rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, and compensation."

How is my payment in bitcoin to Starbucks for coffee, not considered a payment?

You cannot claim a loss on an unregulated currency. Read the Feds report. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:52:18
I was looking for a definition of terms page, but I can't find one. In my mind it is very clear they are referring to a single person or entity here, inferring that you only need to report it, if it goes above $600 to a single person or entity.

Good point. I honestly figured the only changes the IRS made, was whatever got them more revenue. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:47:55
I believe it can be used as a currency, but in the current state if you think you can just "mine" money out of thin air, and not have to pay taxes on it, you are just wrong.

The question is, how many bitcoins were purchased with $1000 and at what price per BTC?
If you buy and sell your bitcoin at the same price, or same basis, you are not gaining or losing anything.
Just because you spent $1000 on bitcoin and then ended up with only $400 less is value, does not mean you lost $400. You need to be much more detailed.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:25:23
And yet what? If you want to challenge my competence, do it with more than "and yet".
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:23:46
It doesn't work like that. If you profit it is capital gains, however a loss is not considered a capital loss because it is an unregulated market with no control from the Feds.

You were the one who said it.

If I provide proof to the IRS that the coin I spent was the coin I just purchased, I don't have a gain on that.

I am more angered than surprised at those peoples reactions. They are going around screaming and yelling about how the IRS just ruined bitcoin's future and there is no way it can be used in daily transactions now because of the tax. People need to know what they are talking about before they spread information like this. Although this is just a small fraction of the bitcoin users, damaging information is damaging information. Lets not take this out of proportion and make it out as though the bitcoin world is done for.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:24:34
It doesn't work like that. If you profit it is capital gains, however a loss is not considered a capital loss because it is an unregulated market with no control from the Feds. The Feds are not going to let you go out and risk 1 million on Bitcoin and loss it all and then claim a loss on your taxes. Please don't spread misinformation.

I think I see where you are going with this.
A payment would be using "currency" but since this is not considered currency it is an exchange of property?

Who? Me or the other guy?

Go read the law. Go look up other tax interpretations based on payments made with property. It is very clear. The wording is not trying to trick you.

Yea you have some pretty high hopes. It is the IRS, they don't have the time, nor do they care enough about people like us to make things easy. They are not going to change their mind, so just follow the rules and stay out of trouble. If you have $50,000 in bitcoin, be happy you have more than $0. Pay a little tax and have some leftover.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:04:56
Did you see "a" U.S. non-exempt recipient? That means one person, throughout the year. So yes, if you pay the same person over $600 you have to claim all transactions. However, I can make 8 million $599 transactions to different people all year and not have to claim those transactions.
Do you feel smart, do you?

"Something like a $10 bill, for example, is fungible. The $10 bill you got from an ATM is the same as the $10 bill you got back as change at the ice cream parlor is the same as the $10 bill you (on a very lucky day) find on the street. It does not matter which $10 bill you spend.
So $10 bills, in other words, are interchangeable. This is why we don’t use horses, bananas, or hand-painted ceramic ashtrays as currency. (The hand-painted ceramic ashtray you got from an ATM is unlikely to be of the same quality as the one you found on the street. This is also why art doesn’t make a good currency.)
“So,” asks Levitin, “what does this have to do with Bitcoin?”
The price at which a particular Bitcoin was acquired (and this is traceable) determines the capital gains on that particular Bitcoin when spent.  If I spend Bitcoin A, which I bought at $10, but is now worth $400, I’ve got a very different tax treatment than if I spend Bitcoin B, which I bought at $390. […] This means Bitcoins are not fungible, and that makes it unworkable as a currency. 
And then:
If I have to figure out which particular Bitcoin in my wallet I want to spend and what the tax treatment will be, Bitcoin just doesn't work as a commercial medium of exchange." -theatlantic.com
Per IRS law, it is not a currency. Anyone could read the IRS law and see that.
