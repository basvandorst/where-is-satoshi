The main point that the bcash people are making to convince others to abandon bitcoin is that bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive. This wallet was created by Roger Ver to get new users to unwittingly download a Bcash wallet. I don't expect the BTC part of the wallet to be user friendly and allow user to manually select low fees. It's in Roger Ver's interest to make his wallet's BTC users pay very high fees.

I agree 100%. I was on the front line against 2x because I didn't want a bunch of CEO's with a mediocre programmer dictate changes to bitcoin ignoring the opinion of the core developers and the community as a whole. I also believed that segwit would provide enough block size increase until the activation of the Lightning Network, and that would be the ultimate scaling solution.
Now it has become apparent that with the increase in users attracted by the new price highs, the increase in capacity provided by segwit is clearly insufficient. LN will not help reduce the network congestion, it will add more transactions to the ones already straining the system.
What is the solution? I am not qualified to tell the core developers what should be done, but I trust them to analyse the situation and come with a proposal to mitigate the problem.

The mass adoption of bitcoin is dependant on the cost and speed of transactions. We tolerate the present fees and the confirmation delays because we are hoarding Bitcoin, but this has to change before it becomes a viable payment system.

Mycelium has four levels. I sent them an email requesting custom fees, and this is the reply I got:
"we will provide lower fees but it's complicated. The current implementation is from Bitcoin Core takes the whole last week into account, guaranteeing the
confirmation target at 95% probability if the network does not exceed last
week's activity. Going much lower than that, results in many more transactions
that never confirm, which is often a much bigger problem to have."
I totally understand their point. If they allow for lower fees that are not guaranteed to make the transaction succeed within a reasonable amount of time, they would be flooded with complaints and bad reviews, even with accusations of stealing user's funds.

Being careful about investing is good advice, but looking at the data from the past two years, it is not unreasonable to expect the price to keep growing at a monthly average of 9%. There have been corrections everytime after a rally, but the lowest point after the corrections have always been considerably higher than the starting points of the rallies. I have told all my friends and relatives about bitcoin and they all react with skepticism and fear of the bubble bursting, so they all are missing the opportunity out of excessive fear.
I will eat my dick if we see bitcoin lower than $3500 ever again.

If you can guess in advance the direction it will move next, then you can make a fortune in a very short time. The problem is that most people really suck at predicting the market (even though almost everybody thinks they can day trade for a profit). The result is that many people here have sold bitcoin at the wrong time, thinking that it was going to fall and we ended up having to buy less bitcoin than we had. Or we sold in a panic when the price was falling just to see it recover and jump to new highs. But when you buy and hold, you always end up winning with bitcoin. We don't think that the price is going anywhere but up in the long term, so HODLing is the best strategy.

I think he is very smart. I respect his attitude of not giving a shit about convention or what other people think. I would have taken offence from the constant sneering, but he just carried on unfaced.
On his dick eating bet, he probably did a projection of the price using bitcoin's average growth in the past, which is very likely to happen. As it reaches new highs, the growth rate will probably get steeper and traditional investors and big players will finally decide to jump in, so half a million in three years is not such a crazy prediction.

You are absolutely right, there is no need for a new means of payment in countries where inflation is low,  the government is not likely to confiscate bank accounts or gold and banks service everyone. This is not the case in most of the world, but if you live in one of the few privileged countries, then you don't need to use bitcoin.
Even in countries where the poor have no access to banking services or the government is not to be trusted, right now it is too expensive to use bitcoin for everyday purchases and there are very few places that accept it anyway.
There is another aspect of bitcoin though, it can be used as a store of value in the same way as gold, stocks or real state. When you make the choice to keep your money in cash, gold or any of the other options, you have to consider the pros and cons that each of those stores of value have.
Bitcoin has these advantages: it can be sent very easily and cheaply around the world in minutes, it is not easily subject to confiscation or freezing by banks, governments or courts, it doesn't need as much security to protect it from thieves as gold or cash and it can not be censored (as in no one can tell you whether you can or can't send your money to such and such person or organisation), and it is deflationary.
So I disagree with your conclusion; it is very useful and it will keep increasing its value.

I'm against the fork personally and I agree with you.

Andreas explains it very clearly, but I'm afraid that big blockers have their ears and minds shut to any argument or fact that contradicts their belief system.
I tried to tell a big blocker on Twitter that micro payments are impossible on a blockchain, whether it's bitcoin, bitcoin cash, dash, ethereum or litecoin because no blockchain can grow enough to support all micro transactions that a global population can generate and still be efficient and manageable, but it was like talking to a wall.
Micro transactions will have to happen on side-chains, and blockchain transactions will have to get more expensive as more people use the system, just like Andreas explains. It doesn't matter which cryptocurrency gets to be the top one, once you get to hundreds of millions of users making several transactions a day, fees will be very expensive for those that want to go on-chain.

I don't think Ver had any problem with segwit.

Don't worry, buying at the peak before a correction feels bad, but as long as you don't sell, eventually (in a few weeks) you will see it rising higher than your buying point. We all have had experience like this, and trust me, the only regrets we have are for the times we sold, never for having bought in the past.
Another advice is to move your bitcoin to your own wallet as soon as you buy them. Don't leave them lying around in exchanges because you will be tempted to sell or to set up limit orders and like I said above, you are likely to regret selling bitcoin later. Just keep them in your offline wallet and let them grow.

It's not that people are afraid, they are angry at the underbelt tactics that Ver and Jihan use to try and damage bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:39:13
Don't worry, they hope to influence the market prices with social media campaigns and Jihan and Ver's pump-and-dump operations, but bitcoin's market cap is already too big to be influenced so easily. 
There are two forces much bigger than them pushing bitcoin's market price higher: one is the thousands of newcomers and hodlers who are waiting for a dip to buy some. This has had a big effect this year, causing the dips to be shorter and shallower. The other bigger force will start next month when financial markets start having access to trading bitcoin. With so few bitcoins available for day to day trade, these two forces will push the price to the moon.
Ver and Jihan want bitcoin to crash and Bcash to replace it, but they don't dare to trade their bitcoins for bcash (as Ver admited in his latest interview). Why? Because they don't mind seeing the fools at r/BTC being rekt, buy they don't want to risk their own fortunes going all in bcash.

I have used it. The problem is that it is called "bitcoin wallet by bitcoin dot com" and when you create a wallet, it creates both a bitcoin Cash and a bitcoin wallet (without anybody downloading or asking for the BCH one) AND it makes the bcash wallet the DEFAULT. What do you think will happen when users send their bitcoin to the BCH address that this "bitcoin wallet" shows by default?
Yes, it creates a bitcoin wallet as well, but it is hidden by default. It is clear that the intention here is to mislead users into using a Bcash wallet when they specifically downloaded a BITCOIN wallet.
We should report this app to Google (scroll down to the bottom of the Google play entry and click on ["flag as inappropriate" and then select "impersonation or copycat"](
Edit: I've just noticed that all the screenshots make it look as if it was a normal bitcoin wallet, there's no hint at all that it will create BCH wallets. They removed/renamed the Bcash wallet before taking the screenshots to disguise its true nature. Deceptive, reckless and sneaky.

If you can connect a node to the bitcoin network via satellite, then governments can't block access to bitcoin.
A few core developers work for Blockstream. Only a couple if the hundred or so bitcoin core contributors agreed with Roger Ver and Jihan Wu that removing the block limit was a good idea, so they forked bitcoin last August and called it "Bitcoin Cash". They seem to believe that in order to succeed, they need to make bitcoin fail and then people will abandon bitcoin and move to their fork, so one of their tactics is to push the narrative that bitcoin has been ruined by Core, that core is controlled by Blockstream and Blockstream is controlled by AXA and the Bilderberg group, a cuckoo conspiracy theory.

They don't want replay protection because they are not putting forward a proposal to move bitcoin in a different direction hoping for support from the community. They know that users will not willingly follow their lead. Their only chance at success lies in taking the choice away from us and killing the original bitcoin chain. 
With replay protection, there would be two blockchains coexisting and we could choose which one to use. Without replay protection, they hope to force SPV wallets to follow their fork while they try to deprive the original chain of hashpower.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:08:35
I was also hoping for a peaceful coexistence between the two coins, but it's clear that the status quo is only good for bitcoin, because there can be only one successful chain in the end and bcash can not survive unless bitcoin becomes irrelevant.
They had this planned in advance and chose the best time to finally dump their huge bitcoin stashes to coincide with the return of those who bought bitcoin to get free airdrop back to altcoins, but after they have moved all their funds from bitcoin to bcash, their power to destabilise the markets will disappear. We will return to normality soon, but they will continue to try to sink bitcoin by any other means.

Try this next time: type in the amounts on the order to buy, but don't click the confirmation button; wait a few minutes until it dips, then buy.

I'm personally happy using fiat and credit/debit cards for everyday payments, but I want to keep the bulk of my savings in bitcoin, because it is out of reach of governments and banks. I won't tolerate a bank deciding whether it's ok for me to send money to wikileaks or anywhere I want to send it to nor the US government deciding that I can't transfer money to such and such countries.
I would rather pay zero fees, but I understand it is a privilege to be able to use a spot on Bitcoin's blockchain and I don't need to use bitcoin to buy coffee, so I'm ok with paying a few dollars whenever I need to move my funds

I have heard these two:
1. It is the minority chain in a split fork that has to provide replay protection. They assume that 2x will be the majority fork and therefore the other side should hardfork to implement replay protection.
2. Replay protection would force SPV wallets to upgrade. Basically, if they implement RP they would be in the same position as bitcoin cash was when they forked: almost no wallets and very little support for the new coin from exchanges and services. Without RP they can hijack every exiting wallet and service, no need to change anything in the code.

You have a point, and I wouldn't call it bcash if people were really offended by it, but it seems to me that they just want to confuse the brand and calling it bcash ruins their plan. That is why they never call bitcoin simply "bitcoin", but always add something at the end, like "bitcoin core", "bitcoin segwit", "legacy bitcoin". It's clear what their game is, and I don't know why we should yield to their shady tactics and let them confuse new users.

Of all the alternatives to bitcoin, ethereum is the one with more possibilities of eventually becoming the number one cryptocurrency. It still has a long way to go, for it has to grow faster than bitcoin for a long period of time. It's not likely, but it is possible, if they can find a killing application other than ICO's and manage to avoid further security breaches. I think bitcoin will expand it capabilities and become even more useful and secure than ethereum, but I cannot say it is impossible for the flippening to happen.
Of all the other alts, I don't see any having a chance of ever having more than a niche usage. Most will become irrelevant as bitcoin acquires privacy enhancements, better scripting and the second layer solutions start operating.
The least likely to become bigger than Bitcoin is the one that is a just a clone without segwit and completely controlled by two power hungry billionaires.

The [spamming]( of the bitcoin mempool coinciding with the pump in price of BCH and the massive dumping of bitcoin wouldn't have been necessary if BCH was indeed technically superior. It having bigger blocks isn't an advantage, more like a future liability. BCH's blocks are mostly empty, just a few kb regularly.
BCH has no segwit, so all technical innovations that bitcoin developers are working on can not be copied over because most of them depend on segwit.
There are other alt-coins, such as Ethereum, Monero, Dash, Zcash that can argue that they are better than Bitcoin, because they have other characteristics, and all of them have cheap and fast transactions. The real test will be when they grow to be a few hundred billion dollars in market cap to see if they scale well. BCH is in a different league, technologically inferior.

Any cryptocurrency that grows to be accepted by a reasonable number of merchants as a means of payment will grow in price and experience the same kind of scaling issues as bitcoin.

Remember that one bitcoin was less than $10 for most of 2012 and less than $100 for most of 2013

There are a few things to consider before buying a miner:
1. Is it likely to be delivered before the fork happens in November? If you pay for it now but have to wait for months to be delivered, that won't help at all.
2. A miner is a full node, make sure it runs core and not btc1 software
3. Antminers have a [kill switch]( Get another brand or make sure to disable the kill switch.
4. You will have to find a mining pool that stays with Bitcoin, or mine solo which might not be profitable
5. During the chaotic first few weeks after the attack, mining for Bitcoin might be very profitable, but maybe not. Core could also decide to change to PoS to save bitcoin, which would force you to mine for sw2x to recover your investment. If things go well and Bitcoin survives and thrives, eventually the margin for miners will again depend on the cost of electricity in your area.

People are being given the opportunity to bet on which side of the fork will be the most valuable, and the price of the bt2 token (that will be exchanged for B2X in November) went from .3 to .25 to .20 and now is valued at 0.12 bitcoin. This shows that the community will keep their bitcoins and dump the 2x coin after the fork, so all the uncertainty about the future of Bitcoin has cleared.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:56:58
I sense a possibility that as the trickle of companies pulling out of the NYA becomes a flood, the whole thing might be called off, or at least so weakened that 2x coins will be worth very little. Right now, the futures at Bitfinex are 0.22 for bt2, 0.77 for bt1

If this continues to be the relative value of the two sides of the fork after the split (and there is no reason to think otherwise), wouldn't that mean that mining BTC will be three times more profitable? Wouldn't that be the end of sw2x? The only way I can see for the NYA to avoid this is if they implement a EDA before the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:46:16
Anyone who believes the arguments for the fork that the NYA supporters are putting forward ( this is an upgrade that has the consensus of 95% of the mining nodes, non-mining nodes are irrelevant and there is no need to implement 2-way replay protection because there is going to be only the 2x blockchain left and the minority chain will die soon without any hashpower) will jump at the opportunity of selling their bitcoins and dumping their bt1 tokens while they are still valuable, and getting 3.3x the number of bt2 tokens that in a few weeks will be exchanged for the same amount of upgraded bitcoins.
And because millions of Coinbase and Bitpay users support the NYA, while only a tiny group of core-brainwashed trolls are against it, the price of bt1 will soon tank while bt2 will go to 1, so hurry and don't miss the chance!

You exchange 1btc for 1bt1+1bt2. There are markets for bt1/USD, BT2/USD, Bt1/BTC and bt2/BTC. After the fork, bt1 tokens will be exchanged for BTC and bt2 for B2X. You can also exchange 1bt1+1bt2 for 1 BTC until the fork. The current exchange rate for bt1 is .79878 BTC and bt2 trades for .20950 BTC
The exchange rates come from offer and demand. Most people try to sell bt2 and not many are interested in buying, so the price goes down.
I thought Ver and Jihan would try to pump the price of BT2 at least to .5 BTC (equal to one bt1) but it seems that not even them believe that B2X will succeed in killing bitcoin next month

They are not going to implement replay protection because their plan is to "upgrade bitcoin" (one could also call it "take over bitcoin" or "fire core developers"). They are not interested in creating another blockchain competing for supremacy with the original. They know that their chances of success at that would be minimal, especially if they had to use a different name and ticker. The change they propose (2mb blocks) is irrelevant and unnecessary, and they even admit it. Their only option if they want to succeed is to be the only ~~blockchain~~ bitcoin, and so they must kill the "minority chain".

No, they state clearly that after the initial 10 million, there will be 2,880 tokens issued per day. That is about 1 million more each year until the total reaches 50 million.

I don't know what will happen this time, but in August some exchanges (HitBTC and Bittrex) said they will support both sides of the fork and give their customers both bitcoin and bcash, while others said they will ignore bcash. 
On August 1st there were three types of bitcoin users: those who had bcash and could dump it for up to 0.46btc, those who had bitcoin in their own wallet and had to research the way of getting bcash and wait for the network to allow transfers, and those who had their bitcoins in exchanges that were not giving them bcash. In the end Poloniex   and other exchanges decided to give bcash to their customers, but the price was much lower. 
The moral of the story is that yes, you should control your private keys, but if you want an easy way of splitting your coins and freedom to decide what to do with them, maybe it's worth moving your bitcoin to an exchange that will support both sides from the first day.

Well, that article contradicts itself. It starts saying that "Chinese regulators ordered a halt to all virtual currency trading platforms in the country, acting to further rein in risks related to cryptocurrencies, Caixin learned from a source close to regulators.
The central government’s office overseeing internet financial risks has ordered local authorities to shut down virtual exchanges trading digital currencies with the yuan, a source close to the office told Caixin. The order will affect major Bitcoin platforms such as OKCoin, Huobi and BTC China.
“It means platforms facilitating trading between virtual currencies and legal tenders will not be allowed in China,” the source said. But the source added that the crackdown targets unauthorized trading at virtual currency exchanges, rather than Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology"
Bitcoin "and the underlying blockchain technology" are not considered "virtual currencies" by the Chinese authorities?
Edit: The article is from September 9th. Today is the 14th and BTC China is still open and trading normally. There was no message when I logged in just now mentioning anything about a ban.

No, he got it right. With the EDA, the miners would be making a profit at the expense of the bcash holders *if* they were selling their rewards, but this in turn would make the price go down very quickly. This is happening in slow motion because some miners are not selling their mined BCH, so [in fact they are losing millions.](
If b2x implements an EDA but no replay protection, they would be admitting that they are a minority chain doing a contentious fork against the economic majority, which would be very difficult to justify. If they do it anyway, two of the three chains will die before long, and the one that will survive is the one that most people will buy and hold (not bcash, not b2x).

It doesn't work like that. You split a real bitcoin and get 1 bt1+1bt2, then you sell the bt2 and get .22 BTC. You can split this again and sell the bt2, so after a few iterations you should get 1.33 bt1 that will be redeemed for 1.33 BTC in November 
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:11:01
You can sell B2X safely now. I sold mine already at Bitfinex. If they cancel the fork, only those who sold already will benefit from it.
Other perks are that you don't have to worry about finding a safe way to split your coins in November and there is no more risk of replay attacks, because you only have coins on the bitcoin side.
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:06:31
That is very likely, but I don't think China will ban bitcoin exchanges, and if they do, the price will fall, but it will recover after a while and continue growing. It won't be the end of bitcoin.

You can rebroadcast a transaction that's stuck in the mempool. I had to wait once for something like 30 hours and after I rebroadcasted it, it went through.
I think it's better to check  and select a fee that's just over the mass of unconfirmed transactions. If you are not in a hurry, weekends are usually much less crowded.

They still have five weeks to try to come with a face saving excuse. Some of the NYA signatories are fully behind bitcoin cash, so for them any damage this attack can inflict is better than nothing, even if it is clear that it will fail.

I know, I agree with you, I think 2x is doomed and might even be aborted if enough NYA companies realize that they won't succeed and their companies image will be tainted for years. I was just trying to explain why implementing reply protection does not make sense for them.
"Firing core" (or at least taking control of the github repository) is the stated objective some NYA proponents. Others deny it, but they are fooling nobody.

Thanks, I just have to wait five weeks with my bt1 tokens at Bitfinex (or until December 31st if there is no fork), but I'm a hodler anyway. Let's hope that Bitfinex doesn't get hacked again before the end of the year.
I have to say though, I created an account with them just for this chance of dumping b2x, and I'm fairly impressed with the way they implement account security. I'd say this is the most secure exchange I have used.
Edit: I was expecting some of the big players in the NYA camp to prop up the price of the 2x futures to maybe 0.35-0.44 BTC, but they let us (and their supporters) down

I jumped at the chance of getting 20-30% extra bitcoins for dumping my b2x tokens. If I believed in the NYA 95% support bullshit (and if I thought it was good for bitcoin) I would have sold my soul and my children to be able to multiply my bitcoin 4 or 5 times in November. This outcome just goes to show what is the real support for the 2x fork in the community.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:31:17
The issue here is that if there is a possibility that the fork causes a split with two surviving chains, the whole thing should be called off (it would be clear that it is not an "improvement with 95% support") or at the very least they should implement full 2-way replay protection.
If the NYA signatories and supporters don't buy all the bt2 tokens and dump all their bt1 while refusing to implement replay protection, they are maliciously and knowingly putting people's funds at risk.

From Xapo's blog:
on or around Saturday November 18th 2017, a block between 1MB and 2MB in size will be generated by the Bitcoin miners to increase network capacity (SegWit2x). At that point some miners
 may decide to ignore that block and continue mining on a 1MB block max-sized chain and that may create another fork in the Bitcoin Network
They have the cheek to put the blame for the split on the miners who will follow the original chain.

You forgot these other possibilities:
*  if Hard fork succeeds, BT1 holders lose their money.
*  If Hard Fork succeeds, BT2 holders have their money back.
If you don't think the Hard Fork is likely to succeed (becoming the only surviving bitcoin), we agree. It should be called off then.

I don't like what Ver and Jihan are doing trying to put Bitcoin down by all means necessary after several unsuccessful attempts to increase the block size, but I agree that attacking and demonising them and anyone who supports big blocks is silly and only creates animosity. I think we should stop personal attacks and hate directed towards bitcoin cash and the people who support it. Live and let live.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:18:57
That is a big problem as anyone can see in the repeated attempts by some big miners to control Bitcoin. If there was an easy way of keeping mining decentralised, I'm sure the community and developers will support that.

I will only lose if after the fork, B2X has a value higher than 1/3 of BTC. I sold some of my bt2 tokens for 0.25 BTC, but now no one wants to pay more than 0.2 BTC.
 I'm still hoping for Roger, Jihan or Barry Silvert to show some spine and try to pump the price before its final demise.
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:32:54
You can split your bitcoins intol bt1 and bt2 ( tokens for BTC and B2X) now and sell them at Bitfinex. Then, when the split actually happens, you will get BTC if you kept bt1 or b2x of you kept bt2. Or, if you don't do anything, you will still get both coins automatically. I think this is the easiest option.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:23:24

Yeah, I noticed that. I thought it was suspicious that he would trade his BTC for BCH four weeks before the fork, thus renouncing to his free 2x coins. There were several hundred thousand bcash bought in a few minutes, but then again, the price was 0.05 BTC, so he only had to spend a few tens of thousand BTC. Anyway, it made me wonder whether he knew that the fork was going to be called off.

We should voice our opposition in social media and emailing the NYA companies. Hopefully a few more companies will see the writing on the wall and abandon the agreement.
If it comes to an actual attack that endangers bitcoin, we should HODL (and buy more if we can) and dump bizcoin as soon as it's safe to do so. 
I am sure the core developers are working hard to protect bitcoin and I wouldn't be surprised if they are preparing the tools to go on the offensive in case of need.

I think the miners will watch how this bitcoin cash fork goes, and if it's not a total disaster and there is opposition to implement the Paris agreement, some of them might move to bcc, but if it doesn't survive as an alternative to Bitcoin, they will probably be too afraid of trying another fork

That's also my experience since I started trading in Bitcoin. I realized at some point that if I hadn't tried to make a fortune quickly guessing which way it would go, but had bought and held instead, I would have a lot more coins now.
