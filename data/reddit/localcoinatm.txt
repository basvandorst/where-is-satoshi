Hi u/ELMTAvalanche,   
This phase of installations only covered the Eastern side of Florida. Keep an eye out in the near future for more locations!
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:19:42
Unfortunately we don't currently have a Bitcoin ATM in the UK, however we will inform the team about the growing interest overseas!
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:03:07
Hi u/vexcoin,   
The price you see on our website already includes the 8% fee. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is approximately $11,225. The cost of 1 BTC in Florida on our machines is approximately $12,095. This difference is just under 8%.  
The fee is not added in addition to the price you see on our site. Hope this helps clarify!
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:15:18
Thank you u/vexcoin! We appreciate the support and the questions you bring up!

Hi u/Jamis1979,   
The amount of information we require depends on the amount of BTC you wish to buy. For amounts under $1,500, customers must provide us with First and Last name, along with their phone number.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:06:49
Thank you for the information! We will look into this

Hi u/rockingBit
Thanks for the question. We don't currently have any locations in India, but that doesn't mean it's not a possibility in the future!

Hi u/ExcitedHayGuys, our fees are extremely competitive. We charge 8% for the fee, with other Bitcoin ATM operators in Florida asking anywhere from 12% - 20%

Hi u/Beastilaty,   
Where are you located?
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:54:14
Cash only, no ID required! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:32:39
Due to market conditions over the past two weeks, fees temporarily increased to adjust to the supply/demand varying at 13-15%. All of our ATMs will resume back to our standard fee of 10% shortly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:57:37
After the successful transaction, it will appear in your wallet after confirmations. It generally only takes 30 minutes to an hour but due to recent high volumes, it will likely be completed within the business day.  If there are any issues or concerns, we offer a customer support line for assistance. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:38:11
ATMs were down for most of the day due to severely high demand and server issues. Our ATMs are currently back up and running right now (with surges)  and should resume to regular functions within one business day. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:25:51
we are looking into it at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:34:44
Our atms are based on quadriga market prices + our fees and is updated every 15 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:26:43
Currently only Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.

You should never invest more than you are willing and more importantly CAN afford to lose. However, as long as your friend did not sell his BTC at a loss, he can simply HODL and ride out the dip.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:54:56
There are a number of methods to purchase bitcoin such as online exchanges, through people you know in real life and at Bitcoin ATMs.  Each has their pros and cons, so do your research before taking your first steps

Great article! Is there a possibility for an article that covers the Bitcoin ATM landscape in Canada?

Our ATM is only a one-way ATM (cash to BTC). If you look at any other companies on coinatmradar that sell BTC they are actually priced higher

Great seeing the adoption of Bitcoin in Toronto!
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:29:39
If you're in it for the longterm, it's always a good time to buy Bitcoin. If you're trying to time the market you'll find it next to impossible. It's important though that you don't invest more than you're able to lose. Like all investments, you need to make sure you don't put yourself in a vulnerable position should the investment go south.
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:40:16
Great way to securely store your btc. A lot of new adopters need to learn not to leave their crypto in an exchange and instead keep their assets safe with a ledger. 
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:44:36
1. The correct answer really depends on how much your father knows or is willing to learn. If your father is completely new to cryptocurrency it may be beneficial to get him to use a Bitcoin ATM. They're simple to use and I'm guessing your dad already has experience with using a regular fiat atm. He can buy Bitcoin without having to connect his bank account or adding an online payment method - all he has to do is insert cash and he's done. Depending on where your dad lives he may also not need to create an account to get started which is incredibly convenient. These ATMs can handle transactions from as small as $20 to $10000 so the "largeness" of the transaction can likely be handled. However if your father is looking to do even larger amounts an OTC trading platform will likely give him the experience and rates. 
2. The best wallet is a hardware wallet like Trezor or a Ledger Nano S. 
3. The rate and amount he buys is completely up to him, however if your father is new to this and is trying to "time" the market - it's incredibly difficult to do. Taxes also depend on where your father lives. Ultimately it will be the responsibility of your Father to report any necessary details to the government. 
4. The best way to protect his Bitcoin is to educate himself on how exactly Bitcoin works. He should under no circumstances give away his mnemonic phrase to ANYONE. Write those words onto a piece of paper and laminate it and stick it into a safety deposit box.
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:36:58
The biggest hurdle that crypto has to surpass in the coming years is how exactly the governments of the world want to classify the digital currency
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:49:58
Congratulations!  That's very impressive! HODL is great, but spending and purchasing bitcoin is even more helpful for the community and currency as a whole. Hopefully, more people start adopting crypto and understand they can start small and build up over time! 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:17:53
Store your crypto offline in a ledger or paper wallet.  If you are prone to losing items, i would avoid a paper wallet.  Ledger nano S is an offline ledger wallet that will securely hold your coins

@_date: 2019-10-02 16:33:09
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. This sign was stolen from one of our ATM locations, we have since sent out a team that successfully recovered the sign. We are working closely with the authorities to ensure issues like these do not arise again. We take the safety of our community very seriously and as such, we will be removing all A-frames from our locations throughout Toronto.
We work hard to normalize Bitcoin adoption in Canada, and we understand the negative perception stirred up in the general public when confronted with a Bitcoin sign pointing towards a sketchy doorway.
We want to once again thank the reddit community for letting us know about this issue!

Hi u/Vijay_tic,
There has been a rise in the price of bitcoin in the last few days ( [ and that will likely correlate with a large volume of transactions.

Thanks for the interest in using our machines! We do believe that our prices for buying are pretty competitive compared to the other ATM providers, as there are some companies that charge over 20% across North America.  We do have to account for salaries, rent, maintenance and all the other fun things when it comes to essentially maintaining a brick and mortar business.  We definitely aim to continue lowering our rates long term
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:23:30

@_date: 2018-03-29 22:26:30
Anonymity is definitely the biggest factor but also because some users prefer the convenience of just doing something they're familiar with like going to an ATM, rather than learning how to purchase through online venues. Another reason is that a lot of exchanges have long verification times/cap users from purchasing large sums at once. We provide users with an alternative that is simple, safe and familiar. You can watch our animation video [here](

Hey Cyberman, fees for Bitcoin range from approx 6% - 10%

LocalCoinATM understands that the transactions taking place are usually larger than regular ATM transactions, and so costumer safety is taken very seriously. Once a location is selected, we field test it to ensure that it meets our safety standard. If a location falls below this standard, it is immediately scratched.
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:34:05
Not a silly question. If you don't have a wallet you can just download one onto your smart phone. These machines scan the wallet QR, so if you open the app and hold the phone up to the ATM's camera you'll be all set. I know you currently don't have access to a computer, but in the future you can even print out a physical QR code onto a piece of paper and scan that image at the machine.

Hi u/persick,   
While some other Bitcoin ATM providers do charge that much, our fees are much more competitive. We charge on average 6-10%. The price you see on our website is with the fee already included.
