Someone gave this to me for an analysis i did that was trivial by comparison, so gonna pay it forward.

I agree with most if that. All that would be part of the equation to summarize what percent of the wealth will go to crypto. If you believe that the percent is great than 0. Then it will still dwarf anything we've seen yet.

For me there are only 2 things on my mind right now.  
1) Those of us still around since or before 2017 are in it for the LONG haul.
2) I fully expected a dip in BTC prior to the halving. This has happened historically in every prior halving.  
Nothing has changed. More people are still waking up to a new digital future every day.

All I can think is that there was 4 trillion in negative yielding debt last year and I think it's about 15 trillion right now. Bitcoin at a 1.8 trillion marketcap is a 100k bitcoin. I'm hodlin

Wow. Thank you! More of us are waking up to this truth each day. Best wishes brother.

Fully expected someone to say this. Criticisms and benefits should be obvious to anyone so ill just say this,if you are practical, it beats trying to hide your PK somewhere.

If boomers were born in the 60s then Millenials today don't even have a fraction of what the boomers had on a relative basis. My point is that if the investors are the newer generations, then we haven't seen anything yet.

What this guy said. Also check with your bank, they might give you a free safety deposit box and you can store your seed phrase there. Congrats, you are now your own bank.

As you grow up you will realize that these tendencies change over time. Generally people become more conservative with age. So back to my point, this is still the beginning of the beginning.
@_date: 2019-11-27 13:19:46
If that is your opinion, fair enough. My point is that incredible amounts of wealth will be transferred to the millennials in the coming decades. I think it is expected to be the greatest wealth transfer in history.

Yeah but the bitch of the whole thing is that THERE IS NOT ALTERNATIVE to the US. China's debt to GDP ratio is conservatively 400%. Europe is at 19 trillion in negative debt and on the verge of collapse. The entire industrialized world, except the US is in demographic collapse that would take at least 25 years to recover from if every capable woman started popping out 3 babies each right now.   
World is fucking crazy, and bitcoin is chaos insurance.

It is a call option on the future of the fiat money system.

Let's say all the elites are already holding their positions, not throwing down new money. just hodling/trading to snatch profits from weak hands.
You and I and all our BTC friendos are just buying some sats every paycheck, not selling, not market making, no orders on exchanges. But with the prices of bitcoin where it is we can't suck up all the bitcoin if a whale sells, it would take time to absorb the shock to liquidity, but we would. So if the vast amount of the supply is people who are going to hold until 100k or a million eventually the supply will get scarce enough for the price to go up since their are believers and the asset is deflationary, its like a cardinal law of economics or something.
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:06:38
Sure totally. If you think its value is related to what people will buy it for on an exchange. If the price does crash because none of us have any buy orders on an exchange but the VAST majority of us are not willing to sell, the price will go back up.
@_date: 2019-10-17 00:26:05
YES 1000x, YES. It means that price only decreases due to liquidity issues with people trying to manipulate the price. Not due the lack of belief.

Transactions will still happen. Bitcoin can be used as a ledger to permanently record something just by essentially paying a mining fee. It has other use cases that are yet to be fully envisioned. I am all for more transactions though, don't get me wrong.
@_date: 2019-10-17 23:50:29
well in principle I don't disagree with your premise that the info is not accurate, or that more activity is also good. I am also quite aware that even 10k bitcoin being sold (.047% of the total supply) would more than flatten the order book on any exchange, possibly all of them combined. So it is not farfetched for me to believe that there could only be some bots and maybe 100k people worldwide actively trading.
At this moment the entire order book on coinbase in less than 500btc.

I guess I am running a different operating system. I see it as a hard asset that I would only trade for another hard asset; Not as money, due to the game theoretical problems of it being deflationary. Grisham's law - you use the shittiest thing that people will take as your money... which for most of us is fiat. Buy hard assets with shit money and only trade them for other hard assets. That is bitcoins purpose for me.
Edit: for second part of the question we have like a hundred years to see what happens with transaction fees. For now you can easily make the case that the price floor is the cost to mine.. which I hear is currently about 8k/btc.

Yeah.. FUCK. Good point, terrorists and child pedos..I guess if everyone had privacy, sovereignty, and autonomy we would have NO CHOICE but to create a society based on shared values, where people feel heard and have opportunities available to them and support, where we treat each other as human beings rather than inputs into an economic machine.
The only way to stop a lone gunman is to give them the help they need before they even know it. To do this, support needs to be part of the social contract. And I suspect there would be far fewer terrorist if people had options ahead of them rather than more struggles and collateral damage was not an acceptable outcome.  
But I guess a financial surveillance state and plutocratic government echo-chamber is the next best thing..
