around jan 10 it'll go back to your wallet, your fee would have gone through before now but the network was spammed using your tx. Don't post your tx anywhere or you run the chance of it getting spammed

every bull run is followed by a panic dip. More often than not this is usually the best time to buy. you need to not let the big green candles distract you from this fact

it's because coinbase is more convenient with a mobile app and ability to "instant buy"
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:59:47
the bigger question is why are you buying from coinbase instead of gdax

Judging market cap on a coin with over 60 billion in circulation is silly. Just imagine what the price will be when whales dump millions of the stuff
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:23:28
That's correct, but that low of a supply with that a lower of a comparable price tho...
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:12:15
get over it, brian makes money from both btc and bcash. it's no surprise he'd promote any of the 4 coins he has on his exchange
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:33:57
fee too low
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:00:21
fee is only 0.25% at gdax
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:28:07
it'll hit 20k soon but I don't think it will be for at least another week
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:36:32
just use gdax
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:05:13
Put in 1k. worst case scenario, you end up with a couple hundred bucks. Best case scenario you end up with 10k+
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:59:44
If btc were to go to 100k in march I'd still had made more money on alts
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:34:42
the problem is, these hard fork scammers say the coin is only given to their partner wallets. would you put your btc on their partner wallet? "oh whoops sorry we got hacked" that's what is going to happen
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:10:24
this is why alts not focused completely on cheap fast transaction are the best investments atm. People investing heavily in "mainstream" alts do so because they don't ever see btc as the "currency" crypto

They were tucked snug in their bed, with dreams of lambos in their heads. The market cap is a bit silly, it seems you picked the date and price willy nilly! My parting advice is actually quite sound, by that date it could be worth only a pound.

Agreed, I think monero and dash will continue to be big players this year. However going to disagree with you on LN. That might take to 2019 for companies to realize the benefits of it

hmm from what I can tell, he hasn't bought any more btc, just the value of his portfolio is rising because he thinks it's a good long term invest

I just have a bad feeling it's going to be dropping to the low 16s
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:52:34
Yeah its totally not like gdax already has 0% fees with 6+ confirmation between 20-40 mins

@_date: 2018-01-02 18:54:36
absolutely, then people panicked and bought in. I'm guessing the price will drop to around ~13.8 then we'll see what happens from there
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:50:28
you see what's in common with those companies tho? they're all tech companies (except overstock) crypto is something only people (usually) interested in tech are interested/invested in

I think a lot of people are bag holders from 17-19k, once it breaks that again we'll see a big surge in volume. They busted their entire nut at that price and just have to wait it out

At this very point in time, it is not superior. However, in the future it seems very promising that it will return to its place at the top. Just because a new coin says it's better, does not mean it will continue to receive support years into the future like btc has.

So the 0 maker fee applies to only trades that add to liquidity. Getting charged the fee means you were taking liquidity

Theres not close to 100b USD being traded for ripple. Demand is high for a cheap coin because people think they missed out on btc growth

@_date: 2018-01-06 18:17:47
Well, do you want more people in it or not? You need to accept a possible large correction in price with influxes of new investors
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:39:28
exactly, it's much much better to look at the volume traded of a coin.

I too use empty assumptions that it will be 20k next week
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:59:10
you have to ask yourself though: why would someone want to buy my btc for 14k? 15k? if you can answer then wait for the price to go up. I don't think it's worth any more than 13.8k at the moment.

you sure it's that high? that's over $50
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:26:20
This is the  thing people need to understand for adoption. Everyone at my work who has heard of btc still won't invest because they didn't know they could buy a fraction
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:10:24
It depends on a whole lot of things, but $70k by year's end is plausible

cloud mining is for suckers, at least when you buy btc you still have the value of your investment. with cloud mining you have to wait MONTHS to see your investment even break even
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:24:10
no lol, it has a better chance to go back to 16. just sold my holdings, waiting to buy back at 16

no it's probably wells fargo cancelling debit buys
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:50:08
at least it gives it a base value. it costs around $3-4k currently to mine a full btc

Just wait, by the end of 2018 coinbase will support 8 different coins, go ahead and comment a remindme
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:29:07
They were considering the trading of it but decided not to. They will have a BCH WALLET but as far as I'm aware, no trading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:06
grats, we probably won't see that price again for months
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:45:17
that's pretty sad, and I'm not talking about the value of btc
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:36:16
don't think it will get any lower than that, a proper head and shoulders pattern would dictate that 12000 is the absolute low for it
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:30:18

it'd be cool if it were the coins, but it's going to be fiat returned

Until it gets to 17k I wouldn't celebrate
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:52:06
because that first dip returned the price relatively near the ATH and stayed there for a longer period of time
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:15:50
Peer to peer auction sites accepting bitcoin sounds like a disaster waiting to happen
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:22:52
I still do max 401k allocation even though i put most of my earnings into btc. Its silly to not diversify
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:20
If they announce it before, BTC prices would be in absolute mayhem until it happens. Might as well just get it over with

I got mine, you sure you had it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:24:47
Yeah I thought the inevitable dip would come later in December, I was wrong
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:32
I think that would have been even worse tbh, there's no good way of doing it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:04:24
I can assure you you'll make more money by buying/trading btc than cloud mining
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:53:50
this is way too accurate
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:32:09
The best thing less wealthy individuals can do is attempt to buy dips with whatever $30 or whatever you can put in a week. Don't just click buy when the money hits your exchange wallet. Nobody has to miss out. Try to go a month or 2 without buying unnecessary stuff. Want to buy pizza? You could probably make it yourself for cheaper
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:29:13
at least people in U.S. won't lose all their money
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:14:27
Agreed but we will have to wait for people to lose all their money on crappy alts before we see a return to higher numbers. Just like how there was a btc craziness earlier in dec, the same thing is happening with alts

@_date: 2017-12-15 18:09:33
he's kidding. if you want to make any decent money from btc you need more than $100 in it. either invest in altcoins or put at least $1k in btc
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:03:41
I only have 2, let me know when u have 8
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:52
haha just think of the poor sods that sold off at that price
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:11:43
fiat essentially doesn't exist, it's all crypto. you're going to want to buy ltc/eth/bcash and send it to binance
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:22:05
Yes, I firmly believe we are in the bear trap. There will inevitably be a crypto mania so it'd be a better idea to invest in more than just btc though. When there's billions of people on earth, the current ~50m or so users right now seems tiny

people are dumping their btc for ripple, that's what happening. once ripple inevitably dips HARD btc will rise to 15k. just like BTC and so many other coins, nothing is going to rise 4500% without experiencing a hard correction

it's no longer possible with new addresses as of around ~6 months ago. but older addresses the transaction would pass as valid and be stuck forever in the abyss

why's that? it's not that difficult to take an educated guess when a dip happens
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:43:45
can't do it unless you pay a pretty hefty fee
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:19:00
I don't think it's too far gone, we could see prices lower than this. But, people are now accepting it as a legitimate store of value and that's what gives its value. The value of any crypto is given by what people think it to be valued as, a welcome change from the U.S. dollar being an exact amount determined by the government. People actually enjoy the volatility that 1btc could be worth $1,000 or $100,000
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:43:50
There's a button on gdax for submitting a withdrawal increase request

arguments can be made we are also in the bear trap. Ever thought of that? no of course you didn't
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:03:32
Well, you could also sell at a loss and buy in at a lower price. It'd give you more bitcoin. Example: buy at 19k. Sell at 15k. Buy at 13k. You'd end up with around 10% MORE btc than what you started with
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:06:34
3 months to go up 5-6k. ok.

coinbase supports the previous fork, not this one. Direct quote from them: If support for the fork remains at current levels, or decreases, the Bitcoin2x network will be unusable. Coinbase will not support withdrawals or trading as it will not be possible to move these assets. *Currently we believe this is the most likely scenario.*

If it rises back to 20k I will have made a profit, since I don't need the money I'm just going to let it sit until it rises

dad why did you steal all my bits
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:10
yeah honestly. once coinbase gets segwit going and LN is up and running it'll be like bch never existed
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:54:34
It's because they make crazy money from coinbase so their fees on gdax are pretty sick

Yep I just hope you didn't put in money you need soon. It could take a year or a few weeks to return back to that price and I'd still not be in danger of being homeless or anything 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:12:03
I'm starting to think this whole disaster is only going to improve the value of btc too...
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:33:21

@_date: 2017-12-15 19:02:44
well we're in a sort of crypto craze right now, so it's uncertain if we'll see any great growth in altcoins since, for example, LTC is propped up because of btc's growth
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:24:28
Who knows man, it could be $50k a year from now. Who knows?

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:07
absolutely. unless you 100% need the cash within the next week or so, then there's a good chance it'll return to 19k soon enough
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:59:07
absolutely shocking, nobody saw their partner's satoshi btc promise as a scam /s
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:27:18
with 0% fees they trade based on a calculated margin on both the buy and sell side. don't worry too much about it, they don't influence the price that much
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:19:43
Can we take a sec to actually talk about the person(s) who bought bch at 7k+?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:14
well yeah, bitfinex is showing under 4k. There's some crazy manipulation of people who aren't experienced right now
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:02:42
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:18:03
you have only 2 options: try to trade at dips/peaks or hold and try to forget it exists for a while. I'd only begin considering a hardware wallet if you have $5-7k+
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:38:39
I come back from dinner and it's already dipped a thousand and near returned to its point from earlier today, I'd buy now dude
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:36
there's market manipulation at gdax. Look ANYWHERE else and the price is still under 4k
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:08:33

you should get out now if you think 2 weeks is representative of the entire lifespan of it LOL
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:24:11
I like bitcoin just as much as the next guy, but it doesn't have a chance of being worth more than 20k right now because of the high fees and altcoins solving that problem. This is why trading is a better option until the scaling issue is resolved 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:24:46
Going to guess that 2019 will be the public mania phase, perhaps late 2018

If you're willing to take some risk, taking an initial loss then buying lower can pay off. I bought at 19, sold at 15, then bought more at 12.8k because I saw the downtrend coming. Ended up with around 15% more bitcoin than I started with
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:39:07
don't look at the coinbase chart, look at gdax

@_date: 2017-12-27 20:03:51
reputable exchanges only support stable coins. b2x looks to be even more of a shitcoin than bcash so it doesn't stand a chance of being accepted as a legit alt.

When coinbase first opened, you got $1 of btc for completing your profile. I just looked and that amount is worth $58 today lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:46:48
Historically the price increases at Christmas and around the first week of January has a 15-18% drop (basically what we're seeing now) so maybe it just came early this year
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:57:16
If you don't remember it, it didn't happen. I had an account on mtgox too but I never used it to buy any btc

There'd be too massive of a buy wall at 10-10.2k (even now it's currently over 1k), i'd bet all my BTC that it doesn't go to 9k in january, however 12k seems likely with a surge back to 20k by end of jan

bitcoin has "died" more times than you can count on your fingers. I couldn't be more excited about the future of it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:01
I'm a single adult with a full time job, it'd be weird if I didn't have a lot of money to invest. The way I look at it, it has a better chance of becoming 20k+ than it does of completely dying just because of high fees (which can be fixed in 2018) and some altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:20:29
Considering it's been a full 24 hours since the worst of the drop I think it's safe to say we're past the worst of it

absolutely, the most decentralized, stable, and innovative ones will leave all others in the dust. People love to shill for Ripple but it's honestly a shitshow. So glad I sold it at 2.50.

Yeah man it's mostly people who just entered the crypto market after reading some bull articles. You bet your ass the minute they lose 50% of their value overnight everybody will be storming back to btc. Got a limit buy for 12500 as I don't think it will go any lower than 12

the article is all about bull runs, nothing about price dropping to 6k?
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:11:13
I have a better idea. Invest $100k into the next 100 ICO's. You'll hopefully lose all of it within 3 months

machines are expensive to buy, so to recoup their money quickly they rent them out to people. they set the rent prices to a certain percentage that allows for profit as well. think of it like a car rental service. they make more off renting then they do mining

It's kinda something you just pick up after being involved in btc for a long time. My best advice is to look at the order books and study trade history for common trends over past years/months
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:07:39
haha it was pretty odd to see his pinned tweet from an hour ago being some random ass cheap coin. verge was the coin if anyone wondering
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:21:50
Gemini usually is pretty close to gdax tho too. To answer your question though, a lot has to do with the ability to cash out and popularity of the exchange. Gemini and GDAX/Coinbase are arguably the best two exchanges so of course they would run a premium. It's kinda like Target vs Walmart. Target may be more expensive for the same stuff but at least you're not at Walmart (in exchange speak, at least you can cash out easily)
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:16:01

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:08:48

@_date: 2017-12-29 04:08:42
If btc is still a thing 30 years from now then yes I can see that happening
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:01:35

@_date: 2017-12-21 04:41:53
look at the dip from earlier in december of roughly the same amount (19k to 16k). the dip lasted around 4 days. guess what day is about to end today? the 4th day of the dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:24
Yep. this is a good time to get off reddit/coinbase for a few days and let my btc sit. As someone once said "bitcoin may or may not be the promising crypto, but what's important is the idea of cryptocurrency"
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:13:03

Looking at my coinbase transactions from when it first opened depresses the hell out of me.

There's arguments on both sides. Some say we're in the bear trap. Some say we're "return to mean". Here's my argument that we're in bear trap. We are not even that close to public mania. I think public mania will happen later next year, around Q3/4, with a bull trap in 2019. There hasn't been a ton of media attention. Even at work, only 1 out of 10 people I asked even *know* about bitcoin, and everyone asked is in their late twenties-late thirties. I'm not going to consider it "public" until it becomes actually popular. not just popular among people who are into technology. I think people tend to forget that this chart can describe multiple cycles of a volatile thing like btc. People have been using this chart for YEARS with btc. I remember seeing it after mtgox collapsed, and after the china ban.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:37:25

You didn't read. LAW ENFORCEMENT told Binance to freeze the account. This retard gave someone control of his 1.2k btc. It's absolutely his fault. I don't care if it's not his fault that it is frozen. It is his fault for trusting some anonymous exchange with over a million dollars.

You'd be right if this was a typical asset. However, since btc's value is tied to the user amount, unlike a more traditional stock, it's more likely we are in the "anger" zone
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:57:56
yeah let me just use my btc at the grocery sto--- oh wait.
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:29:48
Considering it goes against the profitability of major card companies to also include btc (*especially* credit cards) yes. This means every single company would have to add a third party/inhouse additional payment option of btc for accepting payment. This costs the company money no matter which way you slice it and the number of people that would use it to pay for whatever they're selling would not make up for the cost. 
*But maybe* in the next 5-10 years we can see start to trickle into the average consumer's method of payment, but I'm doubtful.
@_date: 2019-08-17 12:09:25

Of course not, the government shutdown has delayed it

They probably just aren't aware someone can do this. Even super rich people don't realize it sometimes

Yeah man im totally sure you had over 20k in bitcoin years ago. Give me a break

People only support him because he's a big part of why cryptocurrencies are what they are today.  Remove bitcoin from Ross's history and nobody would support the guy.

Considering how easy it is to switch banks, soon the banks that do accept it are going to be getting all the business

it's strange, sometimes the fee is crazy high and sometimes it's dirt cheap

Interesting read. They're not really for or against it, they just don't want a ton of ponzi schemes on their hands

Let's see. People get a loan or buy btc with credit card then send their btc to bitmex to short/long. They get liquidated and now have debt. That's a good reason to protect Americans who don't know what they're doing
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:15:31
in initial pumps people dump their alts for btc. once btc rises and stabilizes, alts will follow suit
@_date: 2018-07-22 22:32:21
Its not allowed in US for a good reason
@_date: 2018-07-13 21:18:39
It includes the people who only have &lt;$100 too keep in mind
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:15:53
it's not manipulation, people just don't want their alts when btc is rising...

He said it will only come true if value of USD drops 3,000%

so after many months you still haven't broken even? just confused looking at price vs earnings
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:30:17
btw mcaffee said that if the price hits a million then that same million will only be worth roughly 40-50k of today's dollars.

brb making a twitter account to say that I have insider information that satoshi himself is buying out coinbase
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:09:19
If you're not averse to giving an exchange confidential details about yourself you can buy them for 0% fee if you live in pretty much any 1st world country except for the land of the dollarydoo
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:23:51
Good point. There's probably billions of dollars worth of bag holders down 80%
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:47:48
coinbase will just not give you them. By the way, in the future, use gdax for trading since using the instant buy feature involves a 1.9% fee
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:17:51
When you buy btc on coinbase the coins are, in quotes, "yours". Technically you purchased them. But you don't completely own them since they're being 'safe guarded' by coinbase in their posession. They'll just remove the coins from your account or negative balance
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:27:10
yeah of course just the fees are rough
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:47:40
You'll be glad you did when a few years from now people will be whining that IRS is back-fucking them over previous tax years
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:45:26
Oh well gdax has no fee in u.s. But coinbase has a fee
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:25:42
At least 1 million USD. Otherwise it's business as usual.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:42:00
bitcoin should only be purchased with money you're prepared to lose

They don't use an exchange. They probably escrow large amounts
