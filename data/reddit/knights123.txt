If you think reporting them to the BBB will be worth your time, you're in for a bad time.

UCF was founded in the early 60s and for many years was pretty small. We've only had a couple hundred thousand grads, and over half of that was since 2000. For the fan base, we've only been good at football for a little while now, mid 2000s or so. We joined c-usa in 2005 (and sucked, even at that level), and joined the AAC last year. 
Now that the Big 12 will probably be looking to increase to 12 teams, I hope we can join that conference. We've won the AAC the last two years and have only lost one conference game.

Yes. Well learning it's this made up currency that you can send/receive virtually isn't very hard. But it takes a while to fully understand how it works, how money is transferred, how money is created, why it's so volatile, etc. And for most you're going to want to understand most of the latter before you put money into it.
I'm an econ major and it still took me a while to figure it out.

You gotta be able to laugh about yourself.

Hell yea, go knights!
Trying to buy some tickets with my bitcoin but apparently you could only do that in October, that seems kinda silly.
For those who don't know, UCF is the second largest university in the nation and we have a pretty good football team. So we're a pretty good target for Bitcoin.

Damn, I missed these places. I didn't see anything at the stadium or the couple bars that I went to about accepting Bitcoin.

Until they actually do

I'll be at the game today, I'll keep you updated on how it all works out. I'm a UCF and bitcoin fan.

Wouldn't it be a good bit more than 10% since he owns 10% of the total mined and not 10% of BTC in circulation? And he wouldn't be diluting the price, just the supply? Most would probably expect the price to drop if this happened but I don't think you can imply causation between the two.

Did you find anything on this? Wanting to do something similar. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:46:37
Yeah they have all the usual stuff. It's still a shit hole though.

Alts can go on bullruns but most of them are way overvalued and built on hype. Most whales know this and are quick to take profits and run whenever the sky seems stormy. 
That’s also why when btc is rising alts take a while until they see gains.

To add, the main issue is it’s all monitored by the government there.

What's there to really audit?

And I should have bought 1000 shares of Apple in the late 90s as well. Hindsight is 20/20 so don't beat yourself up.
