I don’t always sell when it peaks. 
But when I do it continues to gain value.

Dammit, I thought I had a monopoly on that topic!

Forbes, undervalued or overvalued?

The point was there’s never a best time to sell. Who know which way it’ll swing. If you believe in BTC or whatever just buy it and sell it only if you really need to.

Unfortunate placement of the Red Bull poster behind.
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:27:16
I wish everyone who spotted one took a photo and posted it to this sub. I’m totally not bored of that kind of content.
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:30:15
How is that a “quote of the day”?

Squeeze those shorts
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:33:50
I need a good “everything you need to know about bitcoin” video
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:20:30
Dammit, forgot that one ��
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:41:46
Sorry man, I feel bad now. Must remember these posts were all made by real people ✌️ 
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:37:31
Agreed - one would think this is the best place to get Bitcoin info. Instead we have to wade through all this �� 
@_date: 2018-10-08 16:23:30
Thanks for the clarification. I visit maybe every other day via the reddit app. Maybe the app is just a shit way to read reddit?
@_date: 2018-10-08 16:24:35

@_date: 2018-10-16 20:30:02
They did it so stealth like. 
Didn’t they know their account name would appear under a promoted tweet. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 16:01:01
Oh the irony.
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:45:59
Can’t you use both?
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:07:03
Yay, and we get to see a photo of every single one of them. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 17:58:40
That’d be a game changer!
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:34:10
Sorry, if I’d known it’d be upvoted to  spot I probably would’ve tried to come up with something a bit better. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:15:01
This makes absolutely no sense - I love it!
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:10:19
I recommend reading Trading for a living by Alexander Elder. It’s pricey but you’ll be pretty advanced trader (by average crypto standards) by the time you finish the book. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:22:05
I should add these to the list ��
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:40:39
Yep, then people who love low res cell phone images of chocolate bitcoins on badly lit shop shelves can have their own thread. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:39:38
Great tips, thanks �� 
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:32:03
Not first post, I tend to delete posts after a while to leave less footprints. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:36:20
He has glasses, a suit and a tie so I believe everything he says. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:59:00
For sure! In fact if I ever see chocolate bitcoins in the supermarket you know I’ll be excitedly whipping out my smart phone to take a photo.

@_date: 2018-10-08 16:26:06
Much better, thanks!

I love it when a show pauses half way through so I can watch the advertisement videos 
@_date: 2018-10-13 06:47:20
I fully agree, both can coexist as options - in fact they already do. People can still send snail mail even though email is available. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:18:03
It is flat, it’s always been flat. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:02:31
Sorry, I was being sarcastic. But I’ll check out John Oliver’s take on bitcoin, cheers for the link
@_date: 2018-10-14 06:47:11
Some people prefer to have 1000s of something rather than a fraction of one thing. Makes them feel like they da boss.

I suppose you mean “not bored” bet you’re tired of people bitching about your spelling mistakes too ��
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:06:25
Ah yes, sorry. Good advice. Cheers

Everyone says BTC is controlled by whales. 
How can that be true? 
Whales live in the ocean and don’t even have computers. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:42:52
I am outside
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:36:51
Thought as much... thanks for clarification 
@_date: 2018-10-08 16:21:48
And some of the most creative. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:34:56
Good for you bro �� 
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:21:21
I guess vice has decided bitcoin’s not cool anymore.

How much electricity powers all the screens everyone is staring at all day long?
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:22:27
Fascinating, when you mine them do they come out like that or do they still need assembling by hand?
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:55:48
Usually, if I buy it goes down and if I don’t buy it goes up. Makes no difference if it’s crypto, stocks or electronic gadgets. 
I’d pretend to buy (but don’t) then pretend not to buy when it dips (but do secretly). That should work.

Only 36 days left and $11200

@_date: 2018-11-05 14:03:32
After reading it I thought it made the case that using the power to mine BTC was the smartest move.
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:52:54
My google search history is now tainted with “do ducks have penises”  I found out they actually do  and they can be 20cm long!!!

Microsoft I get but Starbucks seems an odd partner at first glance. I’m sure there’s a great reason why - can someone explain? 
@_date: 2019-01-15 09:11:27
No need to shout.

Reminds me of a stoned thought I had the other evening. In the next bull run if everyone can afford to buy a Lamborghini would the price of lambos increase due to extra demand?

There are over 1 billion cars in the world and less than 4000 tigers left in the wild. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:26:24
Seems legit 
@_date: 2018-11-05 20:30:33
Something will definitely happen. 
I don’t even need proof. 
Something always happens.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:49:20
I’d be embarrassed to use that machine. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:22:56
What does “we’ve moved onto bitcoin” actually mean?

I’m sorry I didn’t read but there must be buying otherwise who will the sellers sell to? That transaction is what gives the price. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:24:30
I’m waiting for photos of actual Bitcoin forks.
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:48:50
I thought everyone was just being ironic
@_date: 2018-12-14 08:01:58
I’m so conditioned to seeing license plates being posted I saw this pic and thought “what the heck does HCL mean?” 
I totally missed the bitcoin sticker!
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:52:30
Seems to be missing a “than”. Plus maybe switching “countries” and “US states” would’ve worked better.
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:31:22
That final sentence...
"Lee has previously said that growth in the number of Bitcoin wallets could make Bitcoin worth $10 million per coin in ten years."

Great interview. Thanks for sharing!
