Can anyone explain BitListen to me? I've seen people exchanging hundreds if not thousands of btc. Wtf could they possibly be buying? An island? I mean could they just be shuffling it around? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:41:16
If this keeps up and I buy 20$ could it be worth 40$ soon? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:37:43
That's the thing. I wanna buy some but I'd Prefer to buy low
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:08:37
Wait... It cost money.... To use this shit? Like just a transaction? What the fuck btc! You lied to me! That's just another version of taxes. Why the fuck... 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:21:25
I have no idea.

Is Canada bit coin a reputable site for me keeping tabs on it? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:22:00
Neat. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:43:27
Thanks, answered my question! 
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:07:33
Hmm. Not sure. I got it through the bitcoin widget app on Andriod
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:03:14
So should I buy after the crash or now? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:05:56
Yeah. Then what? I don't get it. In the end, in the dream scenario(?) it will become stable and then what's going to happen? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:24:49
Neat. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:08:13
Is this sarcasm? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:09:00
Fuck right off. This is a troll comment, right? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:04:52
It's 5200$. It's it just going to keep going up? I don't understand that "it's prolly going to keep going up" mentality. So what if it does? Isn't that... Idk. I just want to invest. Make it go down! :(... Then back up! Way up! 
Jokes aside I still want it to drop. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:10:06
Something something this is a USA site. Yeah fuck the yanks.

im not trying to be a "counter argument guy" im just weary of investing any money into something that is risky. I don't have a BTC exchange here that has that kind of cash, let alone one that would allow me to cash out. I don't think its the same as an art like photography but im just a casual interest type. If its money I want to be able to use it anywhere, not special places. Its like a credit card(though not), but why would I apply for a credit card that isn't accepted at 85% of the businesses around me? bad analogy, but the point is unless I can turn it into USD/CAD as easily as I can with fiat(cash?) why risk it? I guess i could always travel to someplace that would but that costs money. im not trying to say its a bad currency its just limited. where as if i had a million USD i could use that anywhere on the planet, reasonably.

If btc stabalizises wouldn't that be bad for everyone that bought it to make money? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:45:39
Well this is nice to see after some questions about btc... Or suspect.. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:15:44
But fiat doesn't have worth based solely on scarcity, no? I'm just a casual interest person but saying the usd is the same as btc is disingenuous. One has much more trade behind it than that, no? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:28:55
is there any proof of this? I'd love to read about it. I don't even know how you could prove it, since everyone is so secretive about their money but its just one of those things that I wouldn't want to get invested in until I know I can get my money converted into USD/whatever currency that I would want to "liquidate" too. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:44:42
exceptions aren't the point here. The point is that you could be a btc millionaire on paper but in reality have nothing close to that. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:51:09
That's the rub. What's the point of a currency If it's a gamble? If it's not guaranteed to have any value it's not valuable. I know your point is "well nothing's guaranteed" but fiat is. You can play the philosophy game but as long as I can't get 1 million btc and turn that into 1 million USD(example currency) it's a gamble. I don't want to have to buy btc then turn it into USD then buy little things worth x amount and go and pawn that. Sure it's got the ability to buy things but as soon as someone with enough btc tries to exchange that it will end up creating a crash or drop, no? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:50:32
Oops it was another reply to my comment that I was aiming at. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:10:12
This is the biggest problem holding me back from buying any btc. I've asked on here before this exact question and got the run around. No bank is going to give up that much "real" money. It's an entirely non enforced currency. If I bought a whole bunch when it was low, the only way I could cash out would be by Nickle and diming..? Even now, wouldn't people see me dumping it and cause a crash if I had that much? It's all on the honour system and only select people /places use it. It's just so sketchy. There's no way to get rich off of it unless you are talking about buying/mining lots in the early days and slowly selling it off every time it peaks. Unless I'm completely wrong and some exchange will let me cash out with millions or hundreds of millions, heck even thousands would cause some panic, no? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:05:43
But the profits!!!? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:44:58
My point was that btc can't easily and safely exchanged for cash. You could have 100 million in btc but your never going to see that. You even point out that the usd has banks, and gdp behind it. While btc doesn't. What's the point of saying you have thousands or millions of btc if it has rare use cases. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:26:18
oh, i didn't know that. You know of people that have actually cashed out millions or hundreds of millions? as I have stated before, im only a casual with passing interest of BTC. isn't the "24hr volume of bitcoin is 2.7 Billion daily" stat just a thing of trades? not conversions? If im wrong i'd love to know. I have asked plenty of times and people just say you can do it, with no real proof. I don't want to get invested in BTC and find out no banks will give me the cash value for my country.

This is hardly the same thing, it's still not getting "cash". And I don't think those companies would take thousands of dollars worth in the sense of me cashing out of btc to get rich, they have no reason or that behind it. No? I mean they can deny it cause it could cause a crash in the value where fiat wouldn't?! I'm talking large amounts here. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:07:18
Proof! Also what about cash? Oh I forgot cash is becoming more and more illegal... Oops I mean "against policy" 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:39:26
Oh shit. I got my pitch fork.

Working on it? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:41:15
Is that possible with a small amount? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:33:19
This really is the problem for me adopting it. Has anyone pulled out a large amount of cash yet? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:30:20
What does that mean?
