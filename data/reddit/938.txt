I give consent because I don't want to live in anarchy. I now need them to spend less on killing brown people and more on healthcare for poors.

This is kindof off topic, but where would one start if one wanted to get into algorithmic trading?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:48:13
Why not? If I give you a 50% discount when using BTC you'd have a good couple of days to buy it back and still be ahead of if you bought directly in USD.

The only thing that frightens me more than selling is holding it. Congratulations on getting out while you are ahead and before it consumes your every waking moment :)

It's like that time Github went down and everyone was laughing because it's decentralized version control but nobody knew how to use it without the central authority. Except my entire life savings wasn't at risk then lol.

I have to think you'd also need the second party to also escrow some amount of bitcoin in that secret address. Otherwise the worst case scenario for him is that he receives nothing and gives nothing. If he also stands to lose coin it makes your position stronger.

1000 times this. The pittance in USD I've made from the price rising is nothing compared to what I'd be raking in as a business in an entirely new market.

The coins just need to be infinitely divisible and there needs to be a reward encouraging a strong hashing network, and then I think hoarding will stop once the price stops rocketing up overnight.
Actually I would buy things in BTC even now if there was some significant advantage over buying with USD, like 50% off? The problem is I'd like to maintain my position on BTC for now, so I'd have to rebuy whatever I spend. Thus there's no incentive if it's some frivolous impulse buy with BTC as a proxy for USD at the current market price, especially since it's such a PITA for me to get ahold of BTC in the first place.

The traders most certainly do use Haskell, I concede the backend might not.

How do you know they are trustworthy?
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:33:09
Thanks for the warning! I was exaggerating, you don't need to worry about me :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:53:51
Yep, they are disgraceful and should have prepared more of their hamster-powered toasters when they saw all the new users coming.

Why should we care if the world has a few more billionaires? At least these people were doing something constructive instead of selling weapons, lobbying to remove environmental regulations, or funding an astroturfing movement to remove taxes at the expense of the middle class.

I have no idea what they could possibly add that would be worse than a perfect record of all transactions ever. I've even seen conspiracy theorists speculate that BTC was created by the NSA.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:47:11
No, this would not work. Anyone could take the hash of an SSN and get the public address of it.
What you are looking for is a zero-knowledge proof, like in the recent Zerocoin proposal. It could work like this; a voter starts with a number of votes and then in private adds them to a cryptographic accumulator. Then they can anonymously publish a vote out to a politician (which would be a specially generated address or something) such that we can prove the vote is contained in the accumulator and is not a duplicate of one already cast but we cannot prove which user it comes from.
This maintains the transparency we'd all like and also the anonymity we all currently enjoy. Check out Zerocoin, you will think it is neat.

How is the day trading going? It seems impossible to have a clear idea of whether it will go up or down on any given day.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:25:33
This is my plan also. I bought today but I am hoping the bubble pops so my purchasing power is greater for the next batch LOL.

Upvote. Their press release is more proud that they managed to fleece all the speculative newbies than horrified that their lag contributed a great deal to fucking up the market. They are unfit for our business. The other exchanges got smashed too, but at least they aren't delighted about it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:37:43
For a financial market I hope they go with Erlang or Haskell. Python and Ruby are too lassiez-faire for it, though I do love them too.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:23:16
We seriously need an exchange that has a single clue about what they are doing.

I think the symbol should be a little tulip to show everyone we have a sense of humor.
