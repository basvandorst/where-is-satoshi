Next stop 10k

I noticed this as well and am equally as curious

Are there any reliable Euro and Asia bitcoin news related sites?
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:49:37
I bought at 1 btc at 11k. Maybe some day I’ll see my 7k again...

No end in sight.

Time to bail out?

This is helpful, it’s all coming together. 
I was looking at Ledger as a hardware wallet, and I see that it secures your bitcoin. Though does this also allow me to store fiat funds?
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:11:43
Resolved. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:52:24
Any minute now...

I see, Coinbase’s ios platform is super simple. I will look at gdax. And I’ve spent at least 2 bills in fees on Coinbase thus far. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:47:14
Man, I wish it didn’t take so long to transfer funds from bank to  gdax right about now.

That’s preposterous. Currency has always been used for illegal activity. Usd, Euro, bitcoin etc... Has the US dollar been used as a currency to buy child porn? Undoubtedly yes. Would this make owning a dollar illegal? You can answer that one for yourself. 
This headline is just another meager attempt to discredit the legitimacy of crypto currency.

So all you really have to do is send your btc from Coinbase to gdax via btc address?
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:37:17
Enough to realize I need a different platform!

I’m newer to crypto. I have been using Coinbase for about 3 weeks now. It took a little bit to get it set up and secure. I have a question for other Coinbase users. How easy/difficult is it to buy and sell these dips? It seems to me that most transactions take a few days at a minimum, so I have really just been sitting on my coins waiting for a big spike in price. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:51:35
11k buy... sigh...
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:11:04
Awesome thank you! How successful have you been so far in this this type of trading?
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:53:47
That’s what it looks like to me. It’s  very difficult to day trade at the moment with the false bottoms and bull traps. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:57:49
Is there a web base that shows volume of bitcoin being sold/bought?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:20:15
lesson learned. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:08:32
It’ll bounce back, it’s going to be awhile though
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:19:05
Working on it!  I assume you use gdax. How confident are you in the wallet security of gdax? Should I explore a more secure wallet option?
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:00:09
Is Coinbase considered a SegWit wallet that you could keep your funds in? And then simply transfer back to gdax when you want to trade?
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:15:34
Does anyone use bots for gdax, if so which ones?
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:33:10
Would this dip be considered a correction?
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:43:33
I sold for a small loss as well. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:34:34
Ah man... bought at 11.2...
