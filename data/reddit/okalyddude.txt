Also too dumb, but I remember reading about a few alt coins designed to use a blockchain to host other info.
One was storage, called Storj
Another was a new top level domain, the only not controlled by ICAAN because it exists only on blockchain, and requires a Firefox extension.
Anyone have info on these or projects like these?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:02:09
The same as any other alt that gets pumped and hyped, and it has less merit than many other coins, to be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:47:35
Very good buy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:32:34
But if that's the case, alt coins are infinitely better than btc. They represent and do more.
Btc will either remain king or fade, it's hard to tell honestly, only atomic swaps or other ways for different crypto blockchains to work together more efficiently is the only way.
The inefficiency of the bitcoin network is baffling.

I make a good solid day trade once, then a bad one to negate it, then 5 bad ones trying to catch up to my good one.
Any advice?  You trade long or short?  How many per day?  Market or always trying to get maker fees?  Do you use software?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:43:01
I dunno, I took out like $10k extra debt to buy at 3-5k, selling regularly and paying my minimum payments.  I will admit today scared me, almost pulled the plug, sold everything, paid my cards off in full.  Instead, I looked at the dip, seems to have bucked the trend at 13k-14k, took extra credit card to buy more.
Yes, could be incredibly stupid and a life of slavery.  Although, if it all comes to nothing, I'll declare bankruptcy.
I'll admit I tried to short btc near the bottom, ended up losing more before buying back in.  The day trade is addictive and hard to give up, when you make a good one, then make a bad one, then try to make a good one to pay it back and end up fucking up 10 times in a row and losing a lot of your funds. 
But one thing that caused me to look at the big picture, is that all my long holds are UP quite a bit the past few days (at least relative to btc, meaning they're holding their value) this doesn't apply to most the big ones that are on bitfinex, but some of the ones on bittrex have been holding just fine, doubled my btc value last week while btc was coming down.  
So the tech is still proving itself valuable.  The idea is still there.  If I'm wrong I'll be very wrong of course, but if I'm right, and next year it's doubled again to 30-50k at some point, and ethereum and major crypto are starting to catch up in liquidity to btc, it's still early in the crypto marketplace in my opinion.  Even a btc drop to 1k would put us back to the value a year ago.... and that would be on par with the drop from $1 to 30 cents, $100 to 5 dollars, etc. 
Also I'm justifying my bad trades and panic selling by saying "I'm still ahead over all, and I believe in the tech" - btc could still be king with lightning, atomic swaps, etc, but I think the decentralized tech will revolutionize many aspects of our lives, and lots of coins are trying to perfect it.

big one now, was at the bar and had JUST closed my short, not wanting to leave with it open.... aaaaahhhhh
so of course, only answer to missing my short is buy the dip
bottom of the dip is 15,000?  Who's taking bets?  One more dip lower or shoot back up?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:46:55
Wish I followed this advice instead of "waiting for dips" because then when the dip happens, I panic and sell at the bottom of the dip, dip ends, panic and buy on the way back up.  
Stupid.  I'm doing it right now in fact.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:23:26
Of course, anyone from then that held for years and years is sitting fine now.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:04:17
Ok.. but that kind of proves the point.  If it's not made for fast cheap payments, why wouldn't another block chain system that IS be more valuable?  Why wouldn't blockchains that serve more functions be more valuable?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:36:27
Intresting thanks.  I do think there is intrinsic value in crypto, maybe not as much as is put, and maybe not even btc itself.  But the crypto technology is going to be huge.  This is why lots of my alts held just fine the last few days, wish I had more in alts and didn't panic with my btc to be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:32:23
Wait, none of the other blockchains are using 1st layer block chain solutions and getting faster and cheaper transactions?  I don't think that's right.  You're correct a bunch are second layer solutions, meaning centralization.  But I'm pretty sure that plenty are 1st layer.  or are you suggesting those other blockchains also won't scale any better than btc?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:44:54
I mean, we made jokes about the "grandpa bought in at 10k" two weeks ago.... 
People were flabergasted someone did this at the all time high of 3k last summer.  Couldn't believe what an idiot. Now he's sitting pretty if he held.  
I wish I followed my own advice and those here better, instead try to day trade, try to move between alts, better you pick the ones you like and hold.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:24:51
Thanks I'll investigate.

Not sure they ever did... Bubbles are still artificially inflated and when the burst, guess who's NOT holding the bag.
Hell, with the big banks, they were holding the bag and just asked the gov for a bailout anyway.

Well, good news for Bitcoin, there are people like JoHoe out there... Bad news for blockchain.info, I wouldn't recommend keeping coins there any longer.  Get them onto paper and hard drives, folks.  
@_date: 2014-12-10 05:18:35
Who's downvoting this good advice??
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:53:52
Sure but what I would imagine any dip in btc as temporary....
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:55:54
I was waiting for it to dip after the split, 12:20pm UTC, but BTC dipped hard 12 hours ago and is already back!  Lol, I need to set up price alarms obviously, don't know how many more dips to $2000 we'll honestly get (pretty crazy to say that...)
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:21:33
That's NUTS why do people donate that much? I guess earlier when it was less, but still!
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:20:32
I'm the opposite, I sold at 4000 and I'm waiting for the correction.
Go down dammit!  I want to buy more!
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:24:48
Because maybe he's running a scam, and if you ask for his tradebot, he hooks you up... and you run it and he steals your coins. Happens all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:54:31
Just be sure to by it all back quick.  12:30pm UTC yeah?  About one and a half hours, what do you predict?  BTC already dove and rebounded earlier.... 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:17:51
highest order that went on OK coin was 10,000,000 USD supposedly.... and when I checked the site a minute before it went down, all the buy orders were at 15,000 and the sell orders at 50,000
Glitch, or someone bought EVERYTHING available on OK coin?  Chinese billionaire hiding money and overbought?  Did someone have the order open to sell at 10,000,000 and got lucky??
I see this once in a while on exchanges that go crazy, once someone unloaded ethereum on one exchange only, drove the price down to $1 momentarily, and people that had stupid low orders sitting there (like $1 for eth and 100 ordered) got them all fulfilled. 
Not sure if that turned out to be real or a glitch.
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:54:51
Showing 48,000 on OK Coin wtf is going on??
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:41:07
Ok go on, so what does Segwit fix that increasing block sizes won't?
Is this evidence for a need for another proof system?  Like Vertcoin / lightcoin etc use?
What's the next proposed CORE update?  Segwit?

well one thing to lok forward to is atomic swaps, I think that the introduction of these with other crypto meant to do the actual transferring, will solidify bitcoin as the main "gold standard" to hold, while you actually spend other currencies. But people will be paid in btc through an atomic swap, and the fee for transfer is very low.

How on EARTH is going on Alex Jones show supposed to be a way to show your credibility and good sense??
Seriously, I'll understand going on Joe Rogan, who talks about crazy stuff open mindedly and has some good points, and is honest that he doesn't have all the answers...
but Alex fucking Jones?  The lizard people control the government through the illuminati, who turn the frogs gay with chemicals in our water and kidnap our children to work on secret moon bases, that Alex Jones.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:16:13
Yeah, it's more that his reasoning and rationale is all wrong.
We get chemicals in our water supply through neglect and corruption to not have higher standards.  Not because of a plot  to expose Americans to bad chemicals.

Wow, it seems you're on the cusp of irony and sarcasm, but people aren't sure.
Please specify.  Sarcasm or no?
I'll follow up appropriately.

@_date: 2017-09-13 15:25:30
Ha, well, doesn't make him wrong about "buy the dip, this is a dip"
But that should just be obvious.  Unless you think this is THE END OF BITCOIN then it's a dip.  And by all records of the past, every metric bitcoin hits, it will eventually hit again.  First peak at 1500 or whatever took like 3 years to get back to.  But I have every faith eventually 5 thousand will be broken. The last threshold was 3,000 and now people don't even think the DIP will hit 3,000 
The only question is, where is the bottom of the dip?  People can guess, there's some manipulation from whales (something this guy doesn't mention) and there's people that play more when the price fluxuates (for better or worse, I usually do poorly but I sold before this dip but kept it on the exchange, ready to buy back in and put extra down)
Shit I'm putting extra bitcoin on my CREDIT CARD that's how sure I am that it's just a small dip.  I wonder if credit card companies are aware just how many people are probably doing this, and in one year, how much more than their interest we'll have.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:20:53
wow that's an impressive trade record
the advice of myself and many, take half your winnings, move them off the exchange, convert 1/4 of your earnings for USD, and play with the rest.  You seem to at least have it down!  But it can turn around in ONE bad day or trade.
@_date: 2015-11-27 23:01:15
Yeah and then you also can't do anything compromising (like btc or political protest or hacking or dick pics) so I think better would be to help people keep making it safer and mrr secure
@_date: 2015-10-05 04:09:57
Thanks for that! (Now I know how much more I didn't know, and still dont fully understand, but definitely keep up the ELI5 explanations)
