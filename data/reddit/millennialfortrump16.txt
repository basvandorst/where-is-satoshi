You could be 100% correct and mock my username, I don't care.
Point is we SPREAD BITCOIN TO ANYONE THAT LISTENS.
Who cares if the Admin does anything or not for Bitcoin, optimism and information is contagious = MORE TRADES.

There has been crash after each 8 year administration and the following President has had to deal with it...
2000 Tech Crash (inherited by Bush)
2007-2008 Bank and Housing Mess (inherited by Obama)
2017 (The S&amp;P is up 235%)...Trump trying to race to save jobs and companies from leaving to lessen effects but won't be able to prevent the inevitable crash of market hitting all time highs
2018 Crash.
Why we are all here investing in Bitcoin, we inevitably know there is going to be a crash and in fact it may be world-wide.  China in particular is showing symptoms of a major crash.
People will take Bitcoin much more seriously when/if this happens.
See, this is how we can have a discussion without politics, just economic bubbles.

You don't want that...pretty sure she's been to the refugee camps and/or is a ridiculous feminist.
