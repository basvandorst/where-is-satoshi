Ahhh f. I read op and replied. I'll do some research on my own, which should be sop anyway. Got any links?

Right. I guess my main point was look at the bright side. While this part (the "training") isn't all enjoyment, it's smoothing out the many jagged edges to polish a project worth being proud of

Is it safe to assume these aren't Christmas temps, but permanent additions, thus making the frustration worth it in the long run? I understand where you're coming from though, and it's a solid argument.

Thank you so much for your insight. I'm new to the community and appreciate your input.

Thank you for this. I'm learning a ton and share your sentiment

Hasn't bitcoin gone through at least 1 correction per year of like 60%, give or take? Why is this recent correction, with the highest floor and ceiling, what scared you off?

Shift your perspective. If you play the long game instead of trying to get rich quick you're going to win. In the end you won't have lost $1k, you will have gained a bit less than you could have. Still a win.
