halleybtc is run by the same ponzi schemer Terry Li, responsible for zeushash
he "they" will respond to your support if it involves adding more money
here are the 7 red signs put out by the SEC for ponzi schemes
losing money to a ponzi scheme is not fun, but having your personal identity stolen is no laughing matter. you have to consider that you might be giving up more than just a few satoshis when you deal with people like this.
if you feel you have been victim of zeushash a/k/a/ halleybtc, get vocal. you can file a formal report at  98 out of 100 people who have been victimized won't bother to do anything about it, that is why they don't implode as quickly. it is imperative that you speak up

by definition, early adopters &amp; affiliates advertising the scam, WILL generate a tiny profit in the short term if their investment is small, but they will only do so at the expense of their fellow brothers &amp; sisters who are coming in later to add money. the ponzi schemer is the ONLY true profiteer and you are taking money from someone else
once the money dries up the scammer closes shop. that is what happened with zeushash when they had an alleged technical issue between October 18th-20th and people started complaining on message forums, so now Mr. Terry Li has changed their name and called it halleybtc. they just restart the cycle hoping to build the pyramid as high as possible before the house of cards implodes, through legal action, or what have you
halley/zeushash does not fit the criteria of other cloud mining contracts, and this is not to suggest that all cloud miners are dishonest by association, but clearly halleybtc is not reputable
