Banks know they will get bailed out so will always act recklessly. Governments will always bail them out while they have monetary hegemony. Time to remove the hegemony, allow banks to fail and so force banks to act prudently.

Have read it, great book, perhaps I need to read it again. ��
Edit: I think the main weakness of the book is that it runs contrary to so much “normie” science that we need to see the arguments in the book strengthened by events aligning with it in coming years.

All  nodes form a consensus about which blocks are accepted. The vast majority of nodes are non mining. Miners do create blocks but do not in and of themselves form consensus about which blocks are accepted into the blockchain.
edit: This is why SegWit2x was not implemented, miners tried to force a change to the consensus which was not accepted by non mining nodes.

@_date: 2018-09-11 22:24:26
No, that’s wrong. Once the news of the attack breaks that will further crash the bcash price as confidence in bcash continues to drop. The amount double spent doesn’t need to be comparably large. 
You don’t need to hold any bcash to short bcash on an exchange. I’m not sure you know how shorting works.

The value of bcash is highly correlated with hashrate which is highly (inversely) correlated with bcash 51% attack vulnerability. So, yes, the financial incentive improves as bcash value drops.

I think the problem was that he was speaking outside of his core area of expertise. That area of the book does need to be developed more.
Saifedean has also commented that he considered writing a section on carnivory for the book but left it out because he felt like he couldn't develop it enough. I like most of what he says but I think he needs to do more work when talking outside of his area of immediate expertise.

I think you don't understand the difference between creating blocks and forming consensus. They are two seperate activities. Here's a source to back me up:


@_date: 2018-09-21 11:07:16
You could make arguments either way, the best I can offer is that it “feels” like the bear market has ended.
@_date: 2018-09-25 09:25:53

@_date: 2018-09-11 12:54:40
You would short BCH on an exchange with leverage, then run the attack, and profit from the BCH price drop. The starting price level wouldn't affect profitability.
A greater price difference (between BTC and BCH) means a greater hashing power difference and so the more people with the capability to run the 51% attack.
@_date: 2018-09-14 02:45:33
Thanks for this, I have seen that video and I do agree with everything Andreas says but he never actually says who *forms* the consensus.

@_date: 2018-09-21 10:20:33
It’s a fix for a very theoretical problem that can’t really do much other than affect directly connected nodes. Even if this exploit was run it can’t propagate through the network.
This is all very very theoretical, but no one is taking any chances.

Bitcoin isn't a fad, it's an onion that you can keep peeling for years.
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:14:34
I see, so it’s good to run a node for decentralised consensus and good to verify any transactions you do yourself but running many nodes yourself is not necessarily useful for decentralisation.

This is a great point. You really could run this attack with very little risk or complication.
edit: Another point to note is that as the hashing power disparity between Bitcoin and bcash continues to increase there becomes more and more people capable of mounting this type of attack. The first person to mount this type of attack will probably make the most profit, with subsequent attempts being less profitable. It almost seems inevitable, thinking through the variables.
@_date: 2018-08-29 10:36:43
I don't follow, many exchanges support large volume shorts.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:13:20
I wonder when the 51% attack on bcash will come. It surely becomes inevitable as the hashing power disparity continues to increase. What sort of profit would one expect to make from this type of move?
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:42:48
Hmmm, some interesting points. I feel like someone will try it sooner or later. I guess we will see over time what the legal fallout is. ��
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:28:48
My understanding is that you need an infeasibly large quantum computer to tackle Bitcoin's *existing* elliptic curve cryptography and there will be lots of time to react before the tech gets remotely close. The reading I have done suggests some work may need to be done in this area at 20 years+.

This is absolutely the case.

Bitcoin has too much momentum behind it at this point for anything else to dominate. There are hundreds of ICO teams that would like you to think differently but Bitcoin's security and infrastructure are unmatched by anything... and this is only the very beginning.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:11:36
There is no fraud or misrepresentation though. There would only be fraud if you double spent and you can do a 51% attack without double spending.

The validation is done from oldest to newest block so once the oldest block is tested this miner's blockchain would be considered invalid and ignored.
Although for your case, before any of this testing is done there's an even quicker test which applies - if one blockchain is shorter than another it is automatically considered invalid.

Question, do these forked coins try to merge in new Bitcoin features after the forking? The rate of development of Bitcoin would mean the forked coins' tech eventually stagnates if they don't do this.
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:08:45
Agree! I've also heard Bitcoin Cash described more generally as a fork attack. I think this has now inoculated Bitcoin from a future case where another Bitcoin community subgroup or other coin may want to attempt something similar. Bitcoin has learned about this type of attack and now knows how to defend against it.
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:14:59
To me there is a clear advantage in having different currencies where the differences favour specific different applications i.e. Bitcoin vs Ethereum

Not sure I understand what you are saying but I think "getting rich" is probably less interesting then transforming the world. Then again, they aren't mutually exclusive goals and I'm not anyone to tell the Bitcoin community what it should be doing. I do think though that to outsiders a preoccupation with getting rich *can* send the wrong message.

I presume for the Bitcoin attack you would have to actually own the miners first and have the infrastructure to run the miners. This would have to cost you well over $200M for one attack.

This isn't the drama that Bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:39:19
Your Bitcoin client is talking to many nodes in the network at any given time. If one or some nodes start reporting an invalid history, your client disconnects from them. Your client then automatically searches for more nodes to connect to. In effect this means it is next to impossible to propagate bad blocks across the network, so the chances of your client actually ever seeing one are close to zero.
I don't believe any of this is usually reported to the user so you would normally be unaware if this happened.
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:34:36
I know altcoiners like this Myspace analogy but it isn't correct for Bitcoin. An analogy which is more correct would be to compare Bitcoin to the internet IP protocol or even to the Linux kernel.
In the best possible way I encourage you to keep reading and learning. A good place to start is to read "The Internet of Money" by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. You won't regret it.

@_date: 2018-05-29 00:47:28
For Bitcoin you can't rent that much hash so the only alternative would be that it's the top mining pools in the world colluding. I don't think that's likely either because they would be devaluing their current Bitcoin holdings and the future mining potential of their hundreds of millions of dollars worth of mining investment.

I can't think of any other motive except maybe a privacy modification to the code, but then there are other privacy coins built for privacy from the ground up.
Your fork's technology is just going to get further and further behind and there's no way you will have the capacity to even effectively review let alone merge all the new Bitcoin features that get developed. I don't think there's anything else that could happen other than your new forked coin slipping in to obscurity.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:10:29
The "gold standard" term is an analogy to help people start to get their head around Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is actually a trust network, the largest trust network that has ever existed. The question to ask is, will the trust in this network exceed the trust placed in fiat currency. If yes then Bitcoin is the reserve.

I think the hype around *blockchain* may be used as a catalyst to bring some industries with lagging ICT infrastructure up to speed. This may result in some benefit. Currency is certainly one application. I think the key is that a blockchain needs to be immutable, distributed and open. Bitcoin is far-and-away strongest on all three counts.
Remember a blockchain is just a linked list where each node contains a list of ordered transactions. That is literally it.
@_date: 2018-05-19 05:56:51
The article does a great job explaining that *blockchain* in-and-of-itself is not enough. A trust protocol needs openness and decentralisation. Very few other cryptos are as open or as decentralised as Bitcoin.
Please remember that currency is only the first Bitcoin killer app. Compare this to email as the first killer app of the internet. We have no idea what is coming next.
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:07:24

@_date: 2018-05-20 04:33:04
All of those applications are great but best practice is that the blockchain that underpins them isn't crippled by centralised control, permissions, weaker proof of work, etc. Bitcoin is best practice.

If you impose fees you limit the activity on which you are charging the fee. For example in this post, the amount of money that could be send overseas was limited.
In December Bitcoin did have some growing pains for sure, but I think it's more fair to look at what Bitcoin fees have averaged historically or even look at what fees are with layer 2 solutions such as Lightning Network. Still though, even in December, people were choosing to pay high fees in order to prioritise their transactions. If you were looking to transfer Bitcoin internationally and were happy to wait a couple hours for the transfer to go through, the fee could still be small.

Seems way off, maybe he meant $6100.
