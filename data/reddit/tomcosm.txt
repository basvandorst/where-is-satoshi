Totally - I've visited a large gaming company before and seen their technology which is so so so much more superior than this, however I obviously couldn't get access to their stuff, so I am making my own as a hobby :)

The plan is to have it streaming 24/7 once I sort out my scaling stuff. I'm not trained in this area so it's taking me time to get into the right mindset, but I'm having fun learning.

Hi There,
I had a very negative experience with Paypal a few years ago, my account got limited and put under investigation for something stupid - I won't go into the details but I had a subscription business so each day of disabled account meant all the subscribers due on that day automatically got cancelled - it took me down to 0 income over the month.
I finally got so mad I went public, and hit up the local media, who we're very willing to cover the story of a small local business getting shafted by a big corporation. I had a phone interview with a newspaper, and then they called Paypal to get their story. Within 20 minutes I had an "executive" from Paypal call me and make everything correct (Lost my subscriptions however so not much help).
Point is, they came running to my aid as soon as a the press called them.

Yeah, I now have hundreds of people. I think I'm going to need this community to help put together something special here.

That's awesome of you mate, thankyou. I'd be more than happy to do the public thing, in your opinion what would be the best way to set this up quickly, honestly and openly so everyone can see it's going to where it should?
