Man you the best.. for real made my day
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:40:43
I sold some at 9400 and at 10400, it just kept raising and I wasn't been able to buy back and not losing. So here I am, sitting and regretting my dumb decisions..
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:46:42

@_date: 2017-12-06 11:04:45
Dude I sold at 9400 to out when it dips. Still waiting and waiting to kill my self, dunno what to do
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:26:11

@_date: 2017-12-03 14:50:44
I feel the last was hasn't finished yet
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:21:56
Yeah I'm going to invest pretty small amounts over time, so I dont think I'll be getting the hardware wallet for now 
Anyways, I'm having a hard time figuring something out about the wallet, I dont get 100% how it works
My first wallet was from bitcoin.com, I remember I used a password to enter and then I had the 12 words phrase which I wrote down, the thing is what is my ID? how do I access to diffrent wallets with my coins if I used the password with this certain wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:29:25
I feel you man, bought 0.55 couple of hours ago before the fall
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:35:43
Thanks, it was a good answer but I'm still not sure if i get it right
if I have adress from blockchain web, can I use the adress to have access to my coins in the software wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:39:46
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:45:28
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:40:16
My 0.55 at 4200, awesome!
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:50:13
I'm have a shitty feeling cause I bought today half bfc at 4200 /:
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:04:21
Damn bro, so true
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:36:32
Ok, I have a hard time choosing a wallet, what do you use? and how to you like it?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:28:06
Hodl till the death, not gonna touch a bit
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:30:39
I was about to buy yesterday, the bank transfer was delayed and still not accepted, it raised 300$ since then........
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:31:42
Not worth the risk youre saying? the blockchain.org looks pretty safe to be honest and easy to use
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:05:23
I dont think so
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:34:47
Yeah ill get around 250$ worth I guess for now
planning and buying and leaving them
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:26:56
Lol just bought 0.55btc couple of hours ago
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:39:33
Is it safe as a software wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:12:46
So is blockchain a third party website or also a software? because you can download it on the phone 
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:18:11
What is the purpose of the seed?
with this 12 words phrase I can have access to my coins from diffrent wallets? or just the one i use?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:53:54
I'm confident as well my bro, it'll turn just fine
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:53:29
I'm ok man, when I got into I got with mindset that I can lose it all, and I can afford it
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:30:22
So is it reccomended to store there my coins or not? also, the 12 words seed phrase is used in every wallet? and to get access to my coins I just need to know the pharse?
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:55:17
About to join as well. Still beating my self for not joining earlier
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:55:32
Thanks, I have a question tho
Yesterday I downloaded the bitcoin orignal wallet, and had the 12 words phase as well, after this I wanted to test is so I removed it from the pc and downloaded the software again, the thing is it automatically loged in to the account, and I cant log out or anything like that
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:47:24
What is this app?
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:34:20
Wallet in still not sure which one, for now I have the Bitcoin wallet, is there anything better?
Also from Israeli site bit2c.co.il
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:49:46

@_date: 2017-08-11 09:00:58
from bitcoin.com
I just entered the software and it was in my wallet already
fuck, i just cant get how it works, I've read alot but the thing is I dont get it
I can access to my coins with every wallet that there is with the 12 words phrase?
what about the email or the password?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:33:18
