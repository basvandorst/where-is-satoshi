Therefore, it follows that diminishes bitcoin usefullness in the name of security is self defeating.

The halving is coming. That means miner won't make as many BTC per block as they do now. As a result, it is likely that some miner will stop mining as it is not profitable for them to do so anymore.
It means that average block time after the halving is likely to increase until difficulty is re-calibrated, which happen about every 2 weeks in normal time.
If half of the miner leave the network, that means that block will only be mined every 20 mins instead of the usual 10, and also it means that re-calibration will need twice as long to happen. That mean that for a while, network capacity and latency will suffer, which is especially a problem because blocks are full.
Adam is proposing to soft fork the difficulty. Ie he is proposing that miners fake their blocks in order to calibrate the difficulty to be half of what it actually is in such a way that current nodes will accept it.
Considering block difficulty is the basis of BTC's security, miners fucking with it is the last thing you want. Adam proposing this seriously is scary to say the least.

Lehmann was profitable. However, they were very leveraged. The used rolling loans for their leverage to keep interest low. You borrow money for a few days, and then do it again a few days later to pay back the initial loan, and so on.
At some point, they ran into some liquidity problem, because they couldn't find enough parties to borrow from, and the whole edifice unravelled.
Incidentally, this is very similar to what is happening between bitfinex and tether.

You said the deflationary characteristic of bitcoin is "counter to their needs".
Their immediate problem is indeed that they can't pay their obligations. But that is a quite limited view of the problem. How do they end up in that position ? That is the real problem to fix.
An addict immediate problem is the lack of drug. Giving the addict more drug will indeed fix the problem, by that standard. As long as you don't wonder how you end up in the situation in the first place anyway.
When someone take obligation it cannot pay, making them easier to pay back will ondy enable more of the behavior that created the situation.

I'm saying that Greece wouldn't have been able to dip itself in such a shithole in the first place if it wasn't able to inflate the money supply. Considering that the possibility of inflating the money supply is what lead Greece in that situation right now, it is idiotic to think that more of what caused the problem is going to fix it.

French here. You clearly didn't read the declaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen. The document is very liberal, in the sense, small governement, individual freedom, etc...
"Les hommes naissent et demeurent libres et égaux en droits." Means that people are equal IN RIGHTS. That is the libertarian view of equality.
"Le but de toute association politique est la conservation des droits naturels et imprescriptibles de l'Homme. Ces droits sont la liberté, la propriété, la sûreté, et la résistance à l'oppression." This state that everyone have irrevocable rights that are: freedom, property, safety, and the right to resist oppression.
Later freedom is defined as:
"La liberté consiste à pouvoir faire tout ce qui ne nuit pas à autrui" ie freedom is the right to do anything except to harm others.
And so on. Sadly, this was never really applied as French revolution is quickly followed by a period called terror, where thing turns into a left wing nightmare.
The philosophy was here since day one and meant mostly the same as it mean today (cf Voltaire's writing for instance). Power in place love to rewrite history, but don't be fooled.

This time this is a bug in a library that is part of the GNU project. It is used in a lot of different free softwares (free as in freedom).
The consequences of the bug are very similar to the one of apple bug, simply for different targets. It is a certificate validation issue.
Bitcoin do not use certificates, so that shouldn't be an issue. However, many system rely on them, such as repositories of software for linux machines. It is good to make sure you aren't compromised. It isn't a threat to bitcoin, but can be threat to your computer as a whole (and as such, for your bitcoin client).

Usually stubborn. The 2 common rebbutal I get are:
 - btc has no intrinsic value. Gold is a good tool for that one as gold is fairly useless, so you can argue that its value come from a mutual agreement that it is valuable rather than from its intrinsic characteristics.
 - btc is deflationary, and it will destroy the economy. A good tool on that one is the technology market, where price are going down all the time and fast, and the economy of that market is not destroyed.
At which point you either instigated doubt in people and you need to give them time to process what you gave them (it changes their whole understanding of economy usually, so they'll need time) or they simply get stubborn because they don't want to be convinced. Most of the people falling in that category, in my experience, have skin in the game.

I recently came to the conclusion that extremism in politic is a virtue. Everywhere in the political field, you'll see people claiming X or Y, and then when you push X or Y to its logical conclusion - usually some horrible Orwellian one - they'll tell you you are an extremist. That is extremely hypocritical.
If you push your stance to its full conclusion, and find completely awful results, that means it is time to come back on X or Y and rethink it.
People calling one on extremism is actually calling someone on rational thinking. Imagine the same thing in science "Sir, I don't like these black hole too much, they are weird and scary. I must assume you are some kind of gravity extremist!"

Molyneux address your comment in many of his videos. He also address people like you (ie: I like the non spanking part, but not the economy part, or vice versa).
Molyneux base its philosophy on the non aggression principle. The logical conclusion of this is that spanking is bad (it is an aggression) and governement as well (governement is a monopoly on legal violence).
What you call extremism is simply internal consitency. Transposed to another field, the vacuity of the position becomes obvious. Imagine a physicist saying "this gravity thing is really nice, but i quite don't like these black hole, they are scary. You must be a gravity extremist to insist on their existance"
To debunk Molyneux, you have to debunk the non aggression principle.
His ego taking too much place (which I tend to agree with) is irrelevent to the debunking of the ideas and constitute an ad hominem.

It is pretty clear that Szabo is behind the white paper, but that he isn't Satoshi Nakamoto.
Most likely, someone responded when he asked help for bit gold, and the person that responded is Satoshi Nakamoto.
If writing matched between Szabo and the white paper, it doesn't match with other writing of Satoshi (emails, etc ...) not with source code.
EDIT: Also when asked about Wei Dai's work, satoshi said he wasn't aware of it. However, bitcoin source code reuse the implementation of Wei Dai from crypto++ for SHA256. That makes it a damn good candidate as well. I'd like to his case investigated more in depth.

Sure, but at this point, they'll have an even worse reputation than they have now, so they'll have to do extra to make up for it.
In France, 3years ago, a 3g mobile connection costed roughly 85€ with 2 years engagement. And free mobile came on the market, proposing a 3g connection (no thetering), unlimited phone call including internationnal, unlimited sms, unlimeted everything to make it short, witout engagement, for 20€ a month. Now, that is a game changer in the market. Other operators ended up having to align their price and services, but that is not enough, as now they a terrible image nationwide. They are seen as untrustworthy companies that robed peoples for ages. They are loosing customers by the truckload and one of the historical actor is in financial difficulties.
That is what is gonna happen to these services, even if they get their price down. Everybody is gonna hate them and prefer the alternative.
OT on Free mobile: operator tried to launch more expensive offers including 4g to continue make fome cash. Free enabled 4g to all existing users, making them looking very bad once again few month after they enabled their offers. Free had 4g compatible network from the get go and was waiting for other to make their move in order to make them look bad. Xavier Niel, the founder of this company also launced the freebox (apple tv like, but in 2000ish, another huge hit in France) and is trying to buy T-mobile in the us as we speak. Keep an eye on it as the mobile world in the usa may drastically chang in the comming years.

I use version control even when working on a project by myself. Here are some reasons :
 - When a regression is added (something used to work, but do not work anymore), I can go back in history and see what set of change broke things. That makes fixing things faster and easier.
 - When I mess up, I can rollback what I did and get everything back in a working state.
 - When I know a feature will need a significant amount of work, I can work on it on a separate branch. That way I won't disturb maintenance work on the branch that is used, or the development of other features.
 - At some point, the project become too big to keep only in my head. Version control software can tell me when I touched some code and why.
 - When the project get older, I can use stats, for instance to know what part of the code are most often modified for bug fixes. These indicate piece of code that are problematic and probably need redesign.
This is very useful when working alone. This is mandatory when working in team. This is criminal to not use when dealing with several millions of user money.

That is half of bitcoin. The other half is a protocol to move value from one account to the other on the ledger. This require what we call "signature" from the owner of the BTC exchanged. As for the ledger itself, it is close to impossible to counterfeit.
If the transaction itself can't be counterfeit, it is possible to cheat via other channels (by tricking people into giving you bitcoins, or secret information called private key so they can do transaction on your behalf). If bitcoin itself isn't know to be cheatable, it must be used correctly/with care to be secure.

For instance: 
"I think proof-of-stake is hard-coded 'the rich get richer' and is deeply unfair."
Note that I don't think this has to be true, but what I think is not the point here.
As of Peercoin, it has high transaction fees, which reduce its qualities as a medium of exchange. Minting (mining via PoS) is based on probabilities, ensuring that an attack will eventually happen (it will simply take longer). The way minting works ensure that rich get richer, as Gavin mention (he is right on PoS as implemented by Peercoin) as new coin creation will eventually be cannibalized by the richest persons in the network.
My take is that coin must be created by PoW. PoS can be used to reduce the need for PoW, as this will get less and less attractive over time as the reward diminishes. PoS reward must be determined by the market. I believe the market value will be small, as the richest person are the one with the greatest incentive to maintain the network running and it is not an expensive process to run.

Is code comparison from his to satoshi's has been performed ? Same for writing, and finally, timezones ? If you have some data i'd like to see them.
Analysis of the pdf paper show great similarities with Szabo's style and timzones matches. However, style match hasn't been performed on posts outside the bitcoin.pdf paper itself as far as I know. I have yet to read his paper on bitgold but some say it is similar.
Hal Finney used to work on a proof of work concept applied to e-money. He may be satoshi. He worked on hashcash, which is very related to bitcoin (proof of work). He also was the recipient of the very first transaction, so who knows.
In the early days, satoshi mentioned that he was unaware of Wei's work. If it turns out to be Wei, that is a tasty stunt he made here :D
EDIT: "From 2007 to 2010, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign." It look like timezone roughly matches.

I can't speak for him, but here is my take.
The standadisation almost exists de facto worldwide already. Apple is pretty much the only manufacturer that do not use usb.
Putting this into the law would have 2 consequences. First, it will add paperwork for any new entrant in the market as the phone will have to go through some kind of certification. This will make it more difficult to introduce new phone in the market and open the door for corruption of the certification entity. This certification will also delay the availability of products in europe.
Secondly, it will make it more difficult to change the standard in the future. If that were done 10 years ago, we would have some kind of old school nokia like round connector. And that would have been great. But now we would struggle to get a new standard as this kind of connector do not transmit data. Huge format battle and probably corruption, we end up with some proprietary standard and all phone manufacturers having to pay the winner of the battle.
The fact that most phone use the same charger is a proof that no law is required for that to happen.
I'm all for standard, and this is why I'm not using an iphone. The non standard charger makes is one of the things that make it an inferior product to my eyes. I can pretty much guarantee you that with this law, the situation may improve marginally in the next 5 yearse but it will be worse in 20 years for reasons mentionned above.

Piketty's book is a pile of bullshit.
First thing first, he made the economic policies of thevctual french governemelt, and we have metrics to juge the results: not at all what piketty's models predicts.
There are various serious flaws in piketty's reasoning and here are, according to me, the worst offenders:
- He compare the top n% of the population with the low m% over time and make bogus conclusions as these person aren't the same over time. Thus concluding on the effisciency of capital gain based on these data is incompetance (or intentionnal misinformation).
- He postulate that capital gain and work gain are independant variables, without proving it (and for good reasons: they aren't)
- His model have a singularity when the growth rate tend toward zero. Using such model to study economy with low growth rate as he deos in is book is unsound.
And, I don't think this is as big of a deal compared to previous points, but the criminality is linked with the trust people have in the justice system rather than inequalities (obviously, high inequalities are often caused by corruption and bad justice system, but correlation is not causation). For instance, the drug market take place in the same conditions as other market, with the same inequalities and so on.

You needed A LOT of time to deduce these ? I mean that's pretty obvious, and, worse, imply that anybody that disagree does so because they haven't spent time studying the problem, which is not the case. Don't be condescending.
To address the spam issue, the block limit is not an effective measure. A system that DDoS itself in case of spam is not a system that is protected against spam. Having block full or close to full makes it EASIER to conduct a spam attack as a small amount of transaction will clog the system.
Your assumption that a limit must be imposed for a transaction price to take place is flawed. In economic terms, the block limit is a quota. The intended goal is to increase fee (on a side note, that's central planning) but that only happen in practice if there is no substitution good (ie there is a monopoly) and nobody can secure a quota rent. But that is not the situation bitcoin is in. there is altcoins (so, no monopoly) and there are way to create a quota rent (21co premined tx for instance).
More generally, a the fee raising faster than bitcoin's value is the sign of a system that is unable to satisfy demand, and such system as no long term economic future.
For miner incentives, there are fee and miner can pick and choose transactions. There you have supply and demand, there is no reason a market can't devellop and no need for central planning. If ever there was, the burden of proof is on you to prove it.
For running node, yes, growing bitcoin mean growing the resources required to run a node. There is no way around this.
As for the uber comparison, what do you think would happen if Uber deliberately chosen to limit the number of driver in order to keep price high ? People would use Lyft instead. In fact, the fact there is a limit on the number of Taxis is exactly why Uber is successful.
See that's the crux of the problem here. Uber raise to match supply and demand. Taxi raise price because there is a supply limit. Taxi is the "fee market". Uber is the market market and that's MUCH better.
Listen, these problem are real. Anyone with experience in distributed system know about these problems. Imposing limit at protocol level is a solution for none of these.
EDIT: ha the all tx must be on chain point is not addressed, let me fix that.
If there are ways to do transaction off chain that people are willing to use, that's all good. The lighting network looks very promising. Yet, it is important that these innovations succeed on their own merit. Scaling off chain is cheaper, and that should provide the incentive to use these. If they are not used as expected, it doesn't mean a limit is required, it means that they must be improved.
Wanting a block size limit in order to push for off chain scaling is an admission of failure. It is ONLY necessary if the off chain solution is not good enough.

Good, while we are at that, I work at Facebook in an infra team. I have no idea what you did at wikipedia, but if it involved scallability that should have given you a good first hand experience of what happen when a system run out of capacity.
I also assume that your management at the time wouldn't have accepted that a system stayed at 3tps (or even 30) for a significant amount of time. In fact, that would probably mean termination for you if you insisted on keeping such limits.
If you are actually competent in the domain, I have to assume that either you don't want to apply it or worse, are actually hostile to the project.
Now listen, you clearly proved that you were a good coder, and projects like LN show you also have a good understanding of crypto. Now if you also have scaling experience, please use it or let others lead on that front.
Right now, if we are realistic, we have a system with a very small capacity, that runs out on a regular basis, and if you guys have experience with scaling, you have not much to show for it at this point.
@_date: 2016-01-28 00:49:21
Truth is, you and I have no more idea than they of what is going to happen. And to be fair, nobody is really eager to know. System running out of capacity sometime just accumulate some backlog and eventually absorb it, or trigger catastrophic chains of event (in our case, increasing the load ressending transactions, checking out because trust is lost, which generate also more transactions, ...).
Frankly, I'm not eager to find out.

Indeed that is the positive aspect of it. The negative aspect of it is that it is the market way of indicating that the system is running out of capacity, and that it makes bitcoin weaker compared to competition.
The fact that fee grow faster than bitcoin's value (which he also describe as a good thing) on the other hand, is very worrying. It is fundamentally unsustainable.
I'd rather see fee growing because volume and value are growing rather than because capacity is running out.

I sure doesn't mean they have the correct solution. It also sure means they have a higher prior probability to have the correct solution. And in fact, having myself some experience with large scale system, I think he was right on these points.
Now does that mean I think he was right on everything ? Surely not. But here is the deal: very few people have experience at that scale, and very few of them are willing to spend time on bitcoin: they just can have more immediate impact working on other stuff. The community won't be successful at scaling without sucking as much wisdom as possible of these people when they come by.
There is clearly a lot of skill in the Core team when it comes to crypto. But there is also a lack of people with experience of large scale system.

Mining berng expensive is a feature. The more expensive, the more secure bitcoin is. Mining cost will alway tend toward the block reward + fee, whatever the PoW used, that is economy 101.

Considering the price is proportional to the square of transaction volume (so far), what is the maximum price bitcoin can achieve with current scaling capabilities ? Bonus question, how much with 2MB + Seqwit (the only 2 scalability solution that are ready to this day) ?
With Segwit + 2Mb, there is no room for more than a few thousand dollar per coin, meaning a market in the tens of billions.

As you know all parameters, you can compute the optimal quantity of fuel using science.
With bitcoin, there are many actors, no way to get all the data (in fact, you can't get these data even theorically as knowledge would change actor's behavior, making the data void). As a result, scientist cannot compute the right amount of fuel, and any scientist that pretend to is just full of himself.

Backward compatibility is the capability of new version to understand what was done by old versions of a software. Bitcoin needs to be backward compatible forever, as it has to understand transaction that were done in the past.
Now forward compatibility is the capability for old software to understand what is produced by the new software. In the case of bitcoin, that mean fooling old client into think they understand and validate news feature when in fact they don't.
Advantage of forward compatibility are that it is easier to move to a new version and keep the network running smoothly while not all nodes are updated. The inconvenient is that node that do not update don't validate everything anymore. If too much node do not upgrade, the network can be at risk.
@_date: 2016-01-28 23:42:10
That is effectively removing the limit, in a controlled manner. Artificial limits are clearly to be removed for a system to scale. That is not even the interesting question, that's a baseline.
The interesting question is, once you get effectively block size limit, how do you keep thing running as it grows. You have basically 2 strategies there:
 - keep the block size growth under control (segwit/ln/fees/sidechains/...)
 - improve how effisciently large blocks are handled (iblt/...)

Bloom filter is a probabilistic datastructure. It can tell you with certainty that a transaction is NOT in a block but only can tell you that a transaction is likely to be in a block.
In the general case, it works very well, but it is possible that someone build transaction such as the bloom filter has a lot of false positives. In such a case, thin block would perform badly.
I don't think it is that much of an issue because that would mean a miner would produce a block that propagate as slow as possible, increasing its orphan rate in the process. While it is possible, the incentives are not aligned for this to happen at scale.
Lastly, the attack is easier to pull off if the mempool is large as it is easier to find collisions with existing transactions in the bloom filter. Increasing the block size, for instance, would make this attack much more difficult to pull off.

That's exactly what is predicted by econ when a quota is in place. It creates a quota rent that is up for actors to pick. Because supply and demand cannot meet, you get a gap in between how high demand is willing to pay and how low supply is willing to sell.
This gap is called the quota rent. While in this case the miner seems to have benefited from the rent, this is rarely the case in practice in the long run.

The problem ir that market incentive do not reflect 2 costs:
 * PoW costs.
 * Node costs.
In economic terms, we call that an externality.
If we can't find a way to include these in the price discovery mechanism, we will see PoW difficulty and node count go to zero as bitcoin scale, which is obviously undesirable.
On the other hand, if bitcoin doesn't scale, it is also pretty much fucked.

That is not a complicated economic question. Thing like quota and externality are usually what you study just after the supply and demand curve (along with price limit and ceiling, taxes and subsidize).
@_date: 2016-02-04 18:39:47
No it is not. Nowhere did I argue that 2Mb or any other size was best (which would be a middle ground fallacy).
I said that the negative impact of increasing the block, EVEN IF 2Mb is ACTUALNY WORSE than 1Mb, is smaller than the negative impact of not negociating.

If the quota is below market equilibrium, you don't get to market equilibrium. Seriously, that's not rocket science.
@_date: 2016-02-10 01:48:24
Yes. That means, unless the transaction count grow dramatically, bitcoin is not very sustainable. PoW cost doesn't depend on transaction count.
That should give you an insight into the big blocker side of things. Note that there are other problem with bigger blocks, like more miner centralization due to orphanage, and higher cost to run a node, so reasonable people may disagree on the right course of action.
But clearly, if the system throughput cannot be increased by a lot, there will be significant problems going forward - shyrockting transaction costs, PoW difficulty going very low, etc... - so we'd better figure out something before it happens.

That's a good strawman you made here. A solid 9/10 . Good work.
@_date: 2016-02-04 20:13:07
You seems to be unesder the impression that a quota and instoring a market for an externality is the same thing. It isn't.
A quota is, for instance, a 1Mb limit on the block size. A market would be miners pay nodes to relay transactions (that's is just an exemple).
They differs in some fundamental way. Creating a market for what is now an externality would simply shift the supply curve and create a new market equilibrium. That is the ideal solution.
A quota force the market bellow a certain quantity. If that quantity is above market equilibrium, then, nothing happens. If it is below, several thing happens:
 * The supplier are now willing to sell at a lower price that buyer are willing to pay. The difference between the 2 is called a quota rent. It is in effect rewarding rentseeking behavior.
 * There is a loss from unrealized trade. The trade between the quota and the market equilibrium are profitable for both supplier and buyers, but won't be made, which makes the network as a whole less valuable.
In addition, the quota can only solve the extenality problem if it is possible to solve the economic calculation problem. Some economists think it is possible (this is morst likely why you were taught quota can solve commons overuse) others not. However, if you think it can be solved, then bitcoin is doomed to be outperformed by a centrally planned currency (which is why so many economist think bitcoin is worthless). I don't think it is solvable, and if you think it is, I suggest you sell whatever bitcoin you have.
On the other hand, if you don't think the economic calculation problem is solvable, then it makes sense keep your coins. It also logically follow that a quota cannot fix the node externality problem, and that creating a market for it is the only solution.
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:48:19

@_date: 2016-02-04 19:04:29
Good, now you are onto something. Indeed, right now, node costs are an externality.
The bad news is that quota aren't an effective tool against externalities. But the good news is that the solution is known: create a market for it.

Problem is, resolving the ECP would also mean that bitcoin is doomed...
Listen I understand there is a problem. Just because there is no solution yet doesn't mean you can wish the problem away and that quota will magically start to work.
@_date: 2016-02-04 19:13:48
Because I'm comparing willingness to negociate, not the block size itself (in fact, I'd argue that the correct block size is unknowable, due to the economic calculation problem).
What I'm trying to illustrate here is that regardless of what the "right" block size is, not negociating also come with a cost. So the right thing to compare aren't is 1Mb preferable to 2Mb, but is 1Mb + divided community is preferable to 2Mb.
Even if you think that 2Mb is worse, I don't think it is reasonable to make the case that it is that much worse that the current division pays for itself.

In fact, basic supply and demand analysis show that bigger block are good for miners and user, but not nodes. Also, block size limit is a quota, and supply and demand tells us it incentivize rentseeking.

There is no good solution for opening the block size to the market at this stage (well, it works with the block subsidize, but it seems to not work once it does to 0, see  )
Bitpay's solution doesn't solve any fundamental problem. It is fairly easy to propose a truckload of variation of block size (and in fact there is, 20Mb, 8Mb, adaptive, no growth, exponential growth, linear growth, whatever...) but none of this solve the problem.

When your vision is the right one, you aren't afraid of other's vision. Namely, if sidechain and LN are superior to raw just sticking more transaction into blocks, people will use them rather than stick more transactions into blocks.

Look closely. With a quota, the seller is willing to sell at a price which is lower than what the buyer is willing to pay. The 2 curve won't meet at the market equilibrium.
I understand that 3 lines is more complicated than 2, but I'm confident you can handle it.
Bonus point 1: The triangle between the 3 lines is the loss from unrealized trade. These are exchanges that would be beneficial for both miners and users but won't happen.
Bonus point 2: The difference between the price consumer are willing to pay and the price seller are willing to sell for now constitute what is called a quota rent.
In layman term, you just created a reward for whoever find a way to screw both users and miner of the bitcoin network.
Bonus point 2 if you understand that saying other are stupid while providing the wrong graph doesn't speak highly of your intellect or literacy in economics.

If we that way, I work on system that serve more than a billion users each day. This guy worked on product that serve, at best, 0.1% of what I'm working on. Should I be impressed ?
Worse, game companies are usually absolutely terrible at scaling their products. That's understandable, it is hard, and games often deal with other problem like graphics and physics. The community is just geared toward solving this kind of problems. Even the serious and big MMO often suffer from downtime, or klunky update process.

Indeed, but it wasn't controversial.
Essentially this kind of changes exists on a spectrum. If nobody wants it, then it is a 51% attack. If everybody wants it, it is a soft fork. There is no technical difference, only qualification.
SegWit is somewhere in the middle. Because it is controversial, it will hurt fungibility.
@_date: 2016-10-04 04:41:34
@_date: 2016-10-09 00:55:52
The biggest drawback SegWit has is that SegWit txs appear as spend by all for old nodes. This means that, effectively, SegWit cannot be cleaned up in any way without making SegWit output spendable by all. This is referred as technical debt by software engineers.
On an economic stand point, that means that, as long as someone think a fork may happen, SegWit output are not fungible. That should strike you as a pretty big deal. If you aren't familiar with fungibility issues, I suggest you watch Matt and Adam introduction talk at Scaling Bitcoin where they covered it.
Now as to alternative solutions:
For capacity: increasing the block size. This solution is superior as it doesn't have an adversarial case of 4Mb. With SegWit, the network needs to be able to absorb a 4Mb block, as such block can be produced, but, effectively, won"t deliver more than the equivalent of 1.7Mb in practice to users. A block size increase to, say 2Mb, has both an adversarial case of 2Mb and a usable space of 2Mb, so it is preferable from a technical standpoint - it delivers more and "costs" less.
For malleability, technologies like FlexTrans exists. They are simpler than SegWit.
On a final note, the fact that I get downvoted but nobody has any constructed criticism should tell you that for many, partisanship has become more important than sound engineering. That's where we are.

1) I was aware of that, but it looks like the fact that the coinbase is not immediately spendable provides the guarantee required to make the claim the market exists. It doesn't looks like this is fatal flaw in Peter's argument and can be very easily addressed.
2) True. However, there is still a synchronization problem within a pool (Jihan did some writing about this in the past). Bigger block clearly incentivize mining centralization.
3) With O(1) block propagation time, there is no market for block as Peter describes it, however, there is no reason to keep block that small either as block space isn't scarce anymore at this point.

Unless you want your SegWit output to become miner subsidize, it is indeed something that will have to be maintained forever.

EDIT: Yeah, as usual downvotes and no arguments.
@_date: 2016-10-09 03:15:55
No, it doesn't just grow the block size, it creates quota per data type. The limit on regular transaction data remains 1Mb, but the witness data can now be put in an extension of the block that can be much bigger.
What does it means ? It means that the block can get as large as 4Mb and that the nodes needs to be able to absorb 4Mb blocks. This is the cost on the network.
What do one get in term of capacity ? Well, as it turns out, users actually do not want to produce transaction with this much witness data. Witness data are just not that big in common use cases. In practice, people will be able to produce only about 1.7Mb of transaction before the first quota fills up.
I deduce from the fact that you did not mentioned quota, in that post or in any others where you addressed me, that you were either unaware of it, or willingly ignoring it.
@_date: 2016-10-20 08:39:31

Hi redditor for one month. Ether you are new here or you are a stooge. But just in case, I explained the downside I see in SegWit. Asking me again to reexplain it all is just wasting my time. If you have some specific question I'd be happy to answer but I don't see any value in reexplaining the same thing again.
You seems to believe that you'll get a 2x increase with no impact on the UTXO. Well if you have been told this, you've been lied to. More transaction will mean more UTXO. SegWit create an economic incentive to reduce the UTXO, but it is unknown in practice what the impact of it is going to be, but certainly not such as you can have 2x the number of transactions without growing the UTXO.


Nobody has corrected me so far, yet I've been heavily downvoted.  The only person that presented some kind of cogent response (except you) is thieflar, and, either by ignorance or dishonesty, forgot some major information that invalid completely hos reasoning. What do you think that means ?

First mover advantage and network effect. But if you are attentive, you will notice that BTC relative market cap has been decreasing compared to altcoin ever since the blocks are full, which is what you'd expect.

0 fee does not mean you get a good exchange rate. Have you read what you are answering to ?
@_date: 2016-10-03 08:11:44
1) Basically you are stating that, once the block reward is gone, building a new block, or rebuilding the same block with additional tx is economically equivalent (you get the same fee either way). I do think that, because the coinbase is not spendable immediatly, the desired incentive stay even when the block reward is gone. Peter's paper could be improved to reflect this, but at the end, this isn't a fatal flaw in the paper.
2/ Speed of light is speed of light, there is not much that can be done here. But overall I think we are in agreement here.
3/ Obvious not everything is O(1) but that's irrelevant here. Please stay on point. If the block is mostly agreed upon up front, then broadcasting the block itself is pretty much broadcasting a block header + coinbase, which is O(1) in the sense that it doesn't depend on the size of the block. At this point, block space isn't a scarce resource anymore - in the economic sense, and supply and demand vanish. I think this is a legitimate concern with Peter's work.

There are other solution for this. The fact that all changes are shoehorned into SegWit should be a red flag to any software engineer. That shoudl answer you question about technical debt.
Everything else is contentless qualification so I see no point addressing.

No it is not bad and a likely evolution of the network.

Economics. The sidechain has different use cases, different security model, different behavior, and as a result, different market. so there is no reason to expect the value of the token on the main chain and the sidechain to match.
As a result, you should expect either all the economic value to move to the sidechain or all to stay on the main chain (modulo a few exceptions).
This is actually more likely to work appropriately using LTC than using a sidechain.

I've been scaling system at work to size far beyond bitcoin's (in fact, I could talk in blockchains per second in term of volume). granted, these aren't the same system but here are some stuff I learned over the years.
Performances improvements are good to reduce costs, but aren't scaling solutions. Don't get me wrong, reducing costs is important, especially for bitcoin as it impact the costs of running a node - and so decentralization - but at the end, it only gets you to the next 10x, best case scenario. If bitcoin has to impact the world at scale, 10x is not even remotely enough.
The second thing is that you tend to hit 2 kind of limits: hard and soft. Hard limit are the one where the system collapse after some point. For instance, memory consumption on a machine is a hard limit: everything works fine up to the point where there is not enough and the system star swapping. A soft limit will just cause the system to gradually degrade. For instance, CPU consumption is a soft limit: the program gets slower and slower as more CPU is used, but there is no point from which the programs goes from fast to slow.
If hitting the hard limit must be an absolute priority, it is not the case for soft ones. Engineer (as I am) tend to want to avoid soft limits but this is most often a mistake. Things are :
 - You never hit a soft limit. The ecosystem start working around them as they become more important and/or load is moved to other systems.
 - By growing the system (and with it the problem), you also makes it easier to gather resources to solve it. This is KEY, and often missed by technically inclined people. It is harder to solve a problem that doesn't hurt that one that does, and, while it seems like the best choice to prevent hurting, it is impairing growth.
