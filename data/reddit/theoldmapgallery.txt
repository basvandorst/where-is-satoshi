HOWDY ALL!! Just wanted to thank everyone for your input and encouragement. It looks like we are going to make history and have our first sale!!
We've learned a lot and had fun! Thanks!

Check, so don't just use coin base, but keep it privately on a computer or print it out?
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:30:43
YES! someone else just pointed that out, so I added the  in the top description. Didn't even think of that, but yes, how else would people know that we are legit? Thanks again. It's the obvious things we need help with so often. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 01:29:03
good points! 2d9, you're our dang angel. Thanks so much. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:29:53
I think I did it. I've tried posting several times, and this one hasn't been taken down with a bot notice. (Not sure what I was doing wrong). I've got my fingers crossed, anything else I should do?
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:10:29
Any suggestions on how to start?
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:43:05
       Thanks so much. Will message him. I did ask the moderators on map porn if I could post, they said "nope", I said, "okay dokey, not a problem". Haven't sent or received anything yet. We are sitting around like kids fishing waiting for something to happen. But it's kinda fun.

This could be the most edited post in history. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:09:12
Great will check!
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:34:21
Sure, it's oldmapgallery.com, but we fiercely need to update it, and the database is behind, and I hav a LOT that I haven't offered.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:08:56
It's what we do! If there are specific interests we're happy to pull some things together.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:40:34
Check! it's on our webpage, but will add that too. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:24:16
Oh geesh. That's freaking obvious. Should I go back and add in the url for our homepage? ( Thanks mdanko. That's just the kind of thing we didn't think about. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:19:55
Oh and please feel free to critique or make suggests on our approach. We're not really sure if we're heading in the right direction.
@_date: 2014-02-28 01:30:56
Howdy, just a quick note to let you know that we put up a small listing today... 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:18:48
YAY!!! We did it right by accident!! Wrong parenthesis! THank YOU!
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:29:15
Thank you! Will get to working on it this morning. I did start a coinbase account.
I don't know who you are, kind soul, but thanks and will ask but won't try and pester. THANKS!
@_date: 2015-11-28 17:32:23
GOSHHHHH!!! THANKS!
@_date: 2015-11-28 17:30:02
YAY!!! So excited to open up reddit this morning. Thanks for your responses and suggestions. AND TIPS!!!! Holy Smokes! We all squealed when we saw this. We don't know how to accept them yet, but our fifth grader assured us this morning that he can help us figure it out. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 17:44:06
Yes. Anything of interest? We have maps from the 1950's and some things as far back as the 1500's. Any areas of interest or specific eras?
@_date: 2015-11-28 17:30:24
Gosh Thanks!!

We can usually sell them from around $200 USD, as they are ephemeral, rare, but great snapshots of the layers of tech culture that made the region. Our big take is that it shows how it took hundreds of companies, not just apple and microsoft to make a revolution. Those big companies fed on ideas and talent from this sea of individual innovators, it wasn't just bill gates and steve jobs.   I think when mankind looks back at "renaissance" moments of cultural and technological growth, we under appreciate this era of fledgling growth.

Agreed. I was going to do the 1752 Bolton/Postlethwaite for North America but I got voted down, as it was too obscure and expensive...
@_date: 2015-11-28 17:32:05
Do we put a bitcoin sticker next to our visa/mastercard sticker in our window? Where do we get those?
@_date: 2015-11-28 17:34:59
Is it an ebay type thing that I'm supposed to list things on? We used to do ebay and got tired of the fees for everything, listing, photos, paypal takes a cut too.
