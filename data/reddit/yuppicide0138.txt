I don't know where I can spend bitcoin on the things I need or I would. One website I do use monthly is about $12 USD. Other than that I don't really have a use for bitcoin.
Can I buy auto parts with bitcoin? My car could use a battery. Can I pay my car insurance with bitcoin? Nope. Can I pay my auto loan with bitcoin? Nope.

I see there's cryptocurrency ATMs near me where I could sell at higher fees if I really wanted and get instant cash.

Doesn't matter about taxes.

"Small merchants/companies always will accept BTC."
No they won't. I could probably ask just about every old school pizza place around here and they won't accept BTC. One guy is super old and only accepts cash. Another place I've been going there for 40+ years, I'm 100% certain they're not going to accept bitcoin.
Seems like this guys wants me to beg people to accept bitcoin, or do like days of research when I could have already been done with my transaction and for example had the battery installed in my car if I paid in credit or cash.

You are the one who says you live off Bitcoin since 2015. Not me. I'm asking you how you do this.. do you pay rent in bitcoin? Taxes in bitcoin? If not, then you don't totally live off Bitcoin. Pay car insurance in Bitcoin? Pay your cable bill in Bitcoin? Pay your electric company in Bitcoin? If not, you don't totally live off Bitcoin. I never said I want to pay my taxes in Bitcoin.
Do you have a job? Does your employer pay in Bitcoin?
I never said I always need to go to a big company, but if I don't see any small companies with good prices I'm not going to go to them.

I'm going to, but I thought as an alternative I might also offer BTC. I don't want to get a PayPal chargeback. I am willing to go through a middleman if needed and I'll tip them.

I'm not going to go to a major corporation and ask that. Does Bed Bath and Beyond accept Bitcoin? Not that I see. Does AutoZone or Pep Boys sheet Bitcoin? Not that I see.
You say you live off Bitcoin. I can't pay my rent on Bitcoin, can't pay property taxes in Bitcoin, can pay my IRS taxes in Bitcoin, can't make my car loan in Bitcoin, can't pay my car insurance in Bitcoin.
Don't lecture me in private about freedom or about HODLing onto something.
If sparks this much of an argument I'll just only offer my item for sale in USD.
