I think that was a great move. No one knows for sure this ie crypto, but I say this is a dip / correction. HODL! It shouldn’t last long.

Ofcourse it’s risky, and yes people shouldn’t put more in than they can lose. But purely statistically speaking all major coins have risen over the past months, people have made a ton of money. It’s hard to not put it any money when everyone is earning.

Oh man thanks for this post. Nice contradiction to the past 50 posts or so lol.

Lol IKR. But the ministry or religious affairs = the government. It’s funny they are one of the only religious institutions mentioning crypto is against the religion. Guess they want to keep control of money and are scared shitless of people having untraceable money and transacting them.

The Ledger Nano S is indeed the safest way to go, but really if you are not in at least thousands of dollars or EUR it’s not worth it. Every time you want to exchange BTC for other coins you have to send it back and forth from exchanges.
The possibility for an exchange to get hacked or locks your account ofcourse doesn’t depend on how much you have invested, but if you’re not i n the thousands the transaction fees just outweigh the reason to use the Ledger Nano S.

Dude... in 48 hours it’s likely to hit 18-10k again. Though there is no likeliness in crypto.

My man. You know your shit. *high fives*

I’m pretty sure a lot of people have invested much more into crypto than they should, and you can’t blame ‘m.
Go back 2 months ago to the top 10 crypto coins. They’ve all 2x’ed, or 3x’ed or way more. It’s been guarranteed money for the past months as the entire crypto marketcap is rising crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:17:13
No it hasn’t. It has dipped way more percentage wise just months ago.

He’s being sarcastic. There is no point in comparing Bitcoin to succesful companies. Bitcoin is not a company.

The fees are very high the past weeks due do (I believe) the number of transactions. The feed are higher than the amount you want to send.
I have to ask, why did you get a Ledger Nano S? It’s much more expensive than your investment no?

Until mum tosses the whole thing when she thinks the colour doesn’t go with the wall colour. Hope you have the seeds somewhere.

I thought he was gonna say... HODL!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:47:41
OK you guessed it right once in a total of trying it 1 time. That means you are statistically right about predictions a 100% of the time.
Now, pls let us know when it will hit 20K so we can prepare accordingly. Thnx.

Just google some. I personally use Blockfolio on iPhone. You can put in how much you hodl and it can show you the value of your portfolio and the crypto’s in EUR if you set it like that in the settings.

Dude, I understand you’re happy for the course it’s going but take it easy on those who sold it mate. (Y)

New to crypto here. Can someone tell me what HODL is? Thought it was hold with a typo but there are too many people making thay typo. Impossible. Brain fuck.
