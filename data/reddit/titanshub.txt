This is outlandish paranoia that ignores what decentralized consensus is. The mysterious "Cartel" cant do anything without consensus, if they do then what they are left with is a fork that contains no real world value. Do you think its in everyone's best interest to just go along with an attacker forcing everyone on to a new fork? Or do you think people are just too stupid to realize what would be happening.
It wouldn't be the first time someone attacked the bitcoin block chain and it wont be the last. If someone was successful at shutting down transactions for a while then the whole system would be forked and the flaw would be fixed. People would continue using bitcoin because that's what has value, not cartel coin. 
If someone had control over how and when software changes were made to the core protocol then the entire system is worthless and bitcoin (or cartel coin) would be fundamentally no different than ecash or any other digital money and it would cease to have any real world value.

The reason that Bitcoin has a 10 minute block time is that it balances the need for quick transaction processing without the introduction of a large amount of orphaned blocks and wasted energy in the mining process. 
Secondly is the fact that other implementations of concurrency that have used 1 minute block times have encountered major issues with difficulty re-targeting where the short block times leave the network much more susceptible to changes in network hash rate and can result in the entire network getting stuck. I believe that feathercoin specifically had this problem and had to ask miners for temporary extra hash power to get them to their next re-targeting block.

Is it really ad-hominem when the man goes around pretending to be an expert in blockchain technology while fundamentally misunderstanding the technology?
In other words: Tim Swanson does not understand what makes the blockchain different than existing data-structures (immutability) and he does not understand enough about how blockchain's work to understand the importance of the token(bitcoin) to the game theory that secures the system.
Argue all you want about the use of the word 'Ethos' but if Tim Swanson didn't want to be criticized then he shouldn't be so public with his uninformed and irrational opinions.

This is inaccurate. A sustained coalition of 51% of miners cannot sign for transactions in which they do not control the private keys to. 
A sustained coalition of 51% of miners CAN doublespend their coins by recomputing the blockchain and they maybe successful in recomputing the proof of work for previous blocks AND beating the rest of the miners for a solution to the next block. 
However, the attackers might also fail. If they want to go far enough back, suspicious activity on the blockchain will trigger a warning to retailers to stop accepting bit-coins until the unusual activities are completed.
A 51% coalition can game the system on the small scale, but the incentives of the system make it prohibitive expensive for a relatively small scale payout. This is a part of the beauty of the protocol. The incentives create a system, that once a critical mass has been achieved, is more profitable to honestly compete in, than to cheat against.

@_date: 2015-05-31 21:40:21
This scenario is not grounded in reality. If someone runs a sophisticated attack on bitcoin then it will be modified and adapt. Two forks will be created, one with the old token and one with the new. Once the attack is stopped the old token retains all the value or very nearly all of it and the attacker had simply wasted his resources.

I'm not sure that's true but I haven't really spent any time there.
To be sure I have seen a lot of arguments that fundamentally misunderstand how technology works, what it does, or why it could be very important come from both bit-coiners and trolls(presumably butt-coiners).
What interested me has always been the technology of distributed consensus and immutable data structures. Even without currency there are a lot of really revolutionary things that could come from this kind of technology, but only if it can be made to work at scale and I think that is still an unanswered question.

I also think that engineering problems should be left to engineers. I did my bachelors in CS and it's not what I do now (because I was average at it) but I do find these discussions very interesting from a technical point of view.
In particular this issue seems to have a lot of non-technical philosophy attached to it that I'm not sure it deserves.
@_date: 2015-07-03 09:52:43
I'm not sure that anyone can make valid claims on the actions and incentives of miners. A lot of that will be better understood in time.
If I had to put money on it I would say that most miners transmit their winning blocks immediately after finding them because practicing selfish mining would be detrimental to the currency and their investment in hardware. It is certainly an interesting question but i have yet to see evidence on either side of that argument.
Side chains are still experimental. I'm not sure they could ever get consensus on the changes needed in core to have a proper 2 way peg but it is certainly interesting tech.
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:16:59
Ok. I'm sorry someone called you a name.
I have stories too. 
I spent an hour having a discussion the other day about some outlandish cartel theory that was going to destroy bitcoin. It was a relatively involved discussion about consensus and incentives and it's good to get to interact with someone else, even if I disagree with them, on a subject that I'm interested in (I did my undergrad in CS).
After over an hour I had made my case and their response was. "Well in my view bitcoin is already "worthless" and then proceeded to rant about how stupid it is. It was a troll, a troll who had taken the time to construct a semi-plausible argument and who was running around just trolling people and wasting their time for no god damn reason other than the LULZ. Did I want to waste an hour having a discussion with someone who had made up their mind about the subject before looking at the evidence to support their theory? Hell no. Were they honest and upfront about it? Hell no. They were using it to manipulate people for the fun of it. Absolutely.
I get it, I got trolled, its my fault but there is blame on all sides of this issue.
@_date: 2015-07-03 08:51:46
This is a fair assessment. I just want to read some technical stuff here and there as well as a little news without dealing with trolls everywhere. That being said, I'm sure there are some legit criticism that I have dismissed and down-voted outright without a second thought.
In my mind the problem has always been the organized invasion by attempting to manipulate the subreddit. I'm sure some people feel the other way around though.
Bitcoin will work or it won't I just cant understand why so many people would dedicate so much time to intentionally trying to discredit it in any way possible.
I think there is some outright unhealthy obsession on both sides of this.
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:59:57

This is just conjecture but less mining profits being dumped on the market for fiat means less pressure pushing the price down.

My issue was not with the content of the article, merely the quality and quantity of trollls.
I find it ridiculous that as someone new to bitcoin I have to wade through this manipulative garbage to find insightful and interesting commentary. Anyone who really thinks bitcoin is doomed and spends every day here trying to shape others opinions by highlighting shortcomings, and distracting others from anything that could be construed as positive is only doing so because they are being incentivized in some way.

It really makes you wonder why people, who believe so strongly that bitcoin will fail, would spend so much time and effort harassing people about it. If its really as bad and stupid as they seem to imply then they must also beleive it will fail without their efforts. Its really quite an unnatural state of affairs.
