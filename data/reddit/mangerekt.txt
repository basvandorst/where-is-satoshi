casual bitcoin user reporting in, heres my experience fwiw. just spent $33 moving btc from one wallet to another as it was made up of weekly payments of $100. then trusted blockchain.info to send the consolidated amount to an exchange for an additional $31 (as i said, casual user, so last time i sent it worked fine). looks like it wasnt enough as its been zero conf for 12 hours
regardless of whether i did something wrong, not paid enough, whatever - this sucks. bitcoin is dated tech and im glad i will never ever transact this POS ever again. thanks

if the real satoshi wanted to lock in anonymity for all time, this was the perfect opportunity. make the transaction, craig wright becomes satoshi, end of the hunt
