brazzers was just a silly example. The future most of us would probably like to see is one without bitpay and instant-to-fiat dumping. So the fact remains that if you make a  payment with Bitcoin alongside handing out your personal info (eg. buying something at overstock.com that is to be shipped to you) you will create an inherently insecure connection between you and *ALL* of the transactions you've made your entire life. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 22:38:20
haha ok, you're right. No need to go entirely RS on me. The implication though wasn't necessarily that one graduates to arch. It's just that (in my experience) once you become addicted to GNU/Linux you seek more and more control over your machine.

I watched a defcon video on how sim cards are actually fully functional tiny computers with a cpu and memory. Most of the SMS money transfer services use sim apps. If the architecture is compatible maybe we could use a sim app to sign transactions(?) and if not possible today maybe in the future sim card companies could upgrade the tech to allow just for that :D

The only way to be absolutely anonymous with bitcoin is to create a private key by flipping a coin 256 times and to never send or receive bitcoin on this address. 
As soon as you broadcast a transaction it can be linked to you. Direct through IP, indirect through someone you transact with who doesn't care about privacy (think giving your phone number to a whatsapp user. It ends up with facebook whether you wanted to or not.), or big-data algorythms. Bitcoin is many things but anonymous isn't one of them.
@_date: 2014-08-28 20:30:21
I fully agree because if I choose to give away my home address I might as well give away all personal information about myself. Otherwise I'd feel like a hypocrite for bitching about privacy.

So let's centralize it, let those central mining entities blacklist transactions at their own discretion and while we are at it make everyone believe that address reusing is more efficient because we can then create awesome static onename/namecoin redirects. Give every newborn one non HD private and one public key which they can use for the rest of their lives and remove all other existing currencies.
Who gives 2 ****s about how Bitcoin scales if it's nature is perverted in the process of forcing its mass adoption.
Bitcoin will be facing many problems down the road. The dev's primary concern should be to make sure Bitcoins spirit as Satoshi envisioned it endures. Everything else, including bitcoins value comes second.

I can go through the most sophisticated means of ensuring my privacy on the bitcoin network and it will mean absolutely **nothing** if the network of people around me don't do the same. When I mention pseudonymity I mean it in the sense of it's definition and since you so convenielty mentioned facebook: I don't use facebook and facebook still knows my phone number, my face, and where I live, and probably much more, simply because (unless I isolate myself from the world) I can't stop people around me from sharing my phone number with whatsapp, uploading pictures or sharing their location.
Keywords that just cross my mind: meta data, big data, IP, erosion of net neutrality. And in the end we are left with an extremely transparent banking instrument that puts George Orwell's ideas to shame.

I have talked to dozens of people about bitcoin. I probe them carefully, mention it in context or just let them observe me as I use it. My goal is to ensnare them as I was ensnared when I received my first 1k Dogecoins.
At the end of weeks of subtle hard work there are two questions that every person has asked me so far. "How can I get bitcoin?" and after they have established that they wish to go the route of least resistance for obtaining bitcoin: "How much does one bitcoin cost?". So far there has only been contempt in every single persons facial expression when I answered. 
Bitcoin has a lot of faults. Some of the biggest ones are psychological. What many of the responses in this thread tell me, is that we are not able to solve the most simple one of these issues by simply agreeing to get rid of ludicrous decimal places for everyday purchases. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 07:42:23
As far as I can tell so far, the HeliosCard uses a Type 1 deterministic wallet. This type of wallet creates a new private and public key for each transaction. The HeliosCard can only store 5 private addresses... So you will have to reuse addresses which no self respecting bitcoiner would ever do. 
The 12 word seed wallets are Type 2 hierarchical deterministic wallets.

There is a psychological difference between owning a tiny fraction of something and owning large numbers of something. By your analogy if there had been only 1 Dogecoin split into 100billion it would have been more successful because it would have been perceived as more valuable. While the truth is that if people had started throwing around 0.001 Doge not a single one of the 80k people on their sub would have bothered to even take a second look.
In the first year of the euro everyone was converting back to their old currency to see what the prices of things were that they were buying. Did they consider the euro a gift card? No, why not? because it displaced the old currency.
I agree, I don't want people to think about fiat when talking about BTC. But that's a consequence that follows naturally **after** adoption. So it's not worth losing any sleep over. 
*Because in the mean time, in terms of value, it won't matter what denomination of BTC you are selling. People will consider it to be worth as much as its fiat equivalent.*

This is exactly how I imagined securing my BTC (two factor with a smartwatch is my back up plan) but as long as HeliosCard promotes address reuse I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

The proposed fork caused by XT isn't comparable to exit. It's more of an extortionate voice "Do as I say or...".

It's not about core being king. It's about consensus being king. Wandering off creating another altcoin, forking the blockchain in the most horrendous way imaginable (you choose to stay core? tough **** you're also signing valid XT transactions!) isn't a technical solution to anything.

I don't care much for the popularity contest between the core devs but *blocking TOR exit nodes to stop DDOS attacks* is such a laughable idea that I have to question the credibility of who ever made the suggestion.
Trying to forcibly push a fork (such as XT would cause), over the course of a few months while fud about future capacity and meaningless transaction spam attacks is running rampant, makes the whole situation look like a circus act. 
The people orchestrating it are socially inept ("I HAVE TO HAVE IT MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY" %footstomp%) at best or cognitively impaired at worst.

Find a O(log n) algorithm that tells you which the n^th element is if you were to merge both arrays to one array of length 2n (also sorted ASC). You are not allowed to instantiate new arrays.

porn is a $97 billion industry and bitcoin just made it a whole lot easier to get exactly what people want, when they want it. Consumers don't have to deal with subscriptions and identity theft and suppliers can substantially reduce their rates as they no longer have to account for fraudulent charge backs. 
The introduction of bitcoin to porn is like moving from VHS straight to digital distribution while skipping DVD and HD DVD (kek) and while it might be true that 


the advantages will draw them to it.

I guess justify was a phrased a little to harsh. I might not know the exact figures but I'm aware that such an endeavour causes expenses. I just know other sites have the gigantic issue of sour customers due to horrendous prices/min while at the same time performers barely make any money due to insanely high fees. 
I expected a significant financial improvement through BTC. All the many other advantages (besides fraud/chargebacks ofc) are obviously great but imo come second in line.

Hey luke, just so you know I've also been unsuccessfully trying to inform ignorant bitcoiners about what the difference between anonymous and pseudonymous is. 
I like to use facebook as an example, even if you don't have an account on which you post identifying information. Your friends over time will do that for you. You don't have whatsapp? Facebook still has your phone number because at least one of your friends are shared their contacts with facebook. Over time facebook mines your profile and everything about you, not because your own privacy policy is bad but because privacy is transitive. People around you don't care about your privacy, you have no privacy. Only other option is to go live behind the moon...
Instead of referencing a "script" that could deanonymize you, I'd just say it takes one counterparty whom you have given, lets say a shipment address to, to leak that information and there goes your pseudonymity.
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:42:57
Calling bitcoin anonymous is wrong. This statement is true under any and all circumstances. There is a strict definition for the word "anonymous", which isn't fulfilled by the bitcoin protocol. Yes, with a little effort one can achieve a higher level of pseudonymity. But that's as far as it goes.
@_date: 2015-07-23 01:29:21
so one chain "wins" and we get another alt coin. The price will suffer in the civil war between BTC and BTC XT but will be offset by users being invested in both? :D
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:17:06
I just placed a sell order at market price and the client is displaying "matching". I wish I could buy, but I'm not willing to deal with okpay's verification BS.
Update1: The status has changed to "in progress" so far it seems as though 2% of my transaction has been processed.
Update2: Actually received money on my OKPay account. I am surprised at how well this is working!

An agenda is the reason Bitcoin exists. Bitcoin constantly evolves according to agendas (such as mike hearn's). The pseudonymous nature of the original implementation is based on the naive assertion that if everyone uses bitcoin people will mostly retain their pseudonymity. The proposed direction of certain individuals makes sure that will never happen. 
You will under no circumstances ever be able to add privacy in retrospect once transactions on the entire network are surveiled, censored and processed by a hand full of mining operators. Privacy is transitive and has to be at the absolute forefront of the discussion. Who cares about (as mike hearn misrepresents and quotes satosh) inflation and owning your own money, when you have a Panopticon at the core of the protocol.
Mike and the rest may not be so adamant about privacy and as so many have done before, trade it for something else (promise of adoption) but hopefully there are enough that oppose that incredibly detrimental mentality. You don't trade your freedom of speech for anything because you have nothing to say. Why do it with your privacy?
If privacy isn't that the forefront of the debate stop advertising *against* address reuse. Go happily trade your bitcoin at coinbase and in NY, watch them and similar institutions in the future police you. There's literally nothing you can do anyway. With Bitcoin there is no such thing as "a little privacy", it's all or nothing by design.
And by the way: Nothing of what I have written has anything to do with anarchism. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:32:55
haha yea, especially considering bitcoin is not anonymous.
@_date: 2015-09-02 20:16:12
Yes it is. Bitcoin with its 100% transparent ledger has the potential of becoming the **worst** privacy nightmare in history. We're talking about a scale that puts Orwell's ideas to shame. The name Snowden doesn't even show up on there. 
If that's the requirement for global adoption, mike and his Bitcoin can get lost for all I care. That Bitcoin doesn't need global adoption. On the contrary, it needs to be fought tooth and nail.

"When Mike Hearn imagines Bitcoin, he talks about innovations for improving and streamlining consumer commerce, but never nothing grander that promotes individual freedom. He stands for privacy, not anonymity and actually wants to improve the ability of law enforcement to police Bitcoin.
I won't speculate on his motivations, but the actions of Mike Hearn are of someone who has consistently and vigorously worked against the interests of the user. Many of his proposals are compromised in a deeply technical hard to perceive way, which manage to allow censorship or surveillance of Bitcoin users.
He's proposed 4 different schemes on separate occasions that are variants of blacklists against Bitcoin transactions. His last proposal was a scheme to allow miners to regulate against double-spend attempts (so that users can buy coffee at Starbucks) by voting whether to confiscate the reward for blocks. Problem is that then the authorities can pressure miners to penalize "bad blocks.” His blog has posts with compromised privacy schemes, ways we could police the Tor network. He's also worked with police against the Tor drug markets.
If you see the CoinSummit YouTube video with him in London, you'll see he proposes putting Bitcoin inside Tor for privacy then starts talking about Denial of Service attacks, and so the need for authentication between Bitcoin nodes. Then somehow he manages to get onto Bitcoin nodes having a proof-of-a-government issued passport...in the name of privacy! He's tried to slant this other ways, but it's in the video 3/4 of the way in." ^[source](

Actually she displays the natural thought progression of *anyone* with half a brain who spends time on this topic. I strongly disagree with some of her other viewpoints...

Her attitude and hyperbole is a little over the top and could be toned down. Other than that she can have a beer on me :)

It's not that simple. Mike is the worst kind of wrong. The hopelessly misguided type. He quotes satoshi without the understanding for the implied assertions:


Yes, you can own your own money and spend it as you see fit under Mikes vision of Bitcoin. But you will not have any freedom under the panopticon that follows (no matter whether wilfully or accidentally) along side it. It might be in line with the title of the white paper but most definitely not what satoshi envisioned.

No, read up on the technical ramifications of the proposed fork. Valid transactions on both chains with *worst case* Mike instituting his milestone blocks to keep everything in check. That's half baked crap.


My bad I literally translated a non-english idiom. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take much to interpret it correctly. As for how that relates to a software project. I thought it's obvious that if you have one person taking the liberty to not only make the last call, but also strongly influence the direction of development, I'd like that person's views to align with users interest.


This is actually ironic because its the only word I actually bothered to spell check and then ended up making a mistake anyway. 
You have my sincerest condolences.

The way I've observed things, one side cares about the principles and ideology that has given bitcoin any and all its value to this day. The other side only cares about how to most efficiently police the blockchain or turn it into VISA 2.0 (they'll tell you it's all for the sake of adoption).
Amir on Mike:




Mike has been confronted with these and similar allegations and has always failed to acknowledge even the slightest sliver of relevance for these concerns. Bitcoin might not be useful if it doesn't gain any significant adoption (I'll give him that because it seems to be the only clear statement on that topic I've read from him so far). But Bitcoin failing is a scenario I choose every day over it gaining large spread adoption while becoming the bastardized brainchild of a few charismatic and toxic individuals who's ideological world views seem to stem from the center of plebeian apathy and disregard for privacy and freedom.

Stomping with their feet screaming "my way or the highway and I want it right now!" as they attempt to force the worst kind of fork onto the blockchain. 
If voice doesn't help and you choose exit, don't do any half baked crap. Just leave and make your own alt coin without dragging the rest of the system down with your ego. That's my position.

I'm used to arguing with my SO over whether a statement I made was truthful or not. I'll be damned if I took on this habit over the internet lol.
Your assumption that a second chain will be suckage is just that, an assumption. The blockchain forks at 75%. Mike overrules everyone else on his 5th proposal of some form of black lists for what ever reason. His chain loses what ever stable majority 2devs + 75% is supposed to represent. Granted that's just as much an assumption, but it's just as likely albeit with a catastrophic outcome. 


I consider what I wrote a theorem deduced by common sense. Only option is to agree we disagree.
We end up having read the same information while coming to opposite conclusions. I can live with that. Personally, looking and Mikes history of behaving like a man child in public, I am happy with his current fringe position in the community. He is (by all accounts I've come across so far) the textbook definition of the type of person who's presence is detrimental to the progress of an OSS project.
On decisive(subjective) occasions his posts contain what I perceive as evidence for a lack of reading comprehension or wilful misrepresentation resulting in logically flawed arguments. On their surface these arguments seem just sound enough to convince someone who either has absolutely no clue or is reading with confirmation bias.
It is exhausting, instead of actually making any headway on the scaling issue, the entire community is left arguing over **one persons** governance tantrums. The most tiring side effect being that it seems most people cant separate disapproval for Mike, from disapproval for BIP101. Mike stirred up the beehive and the topic is now at the absolute center of attention most probably until it is resolved. Time for Mike to be the hero bitcoin deservers, but not the hero it needs right now.
I won't disclose where I'm from.

Just paid for an item through wire transfer. Sold a 380USD GPU last week for BTC. I also received a paypal payment but I wasn't forced to offer paypal... In what country does eBay force escrow service on its users?
Amazon accepts CC payments on my behalf. Which would be a gigantic pain in the *** for me to set up for selling a toaster once every 2 years. The primary reason amazon handles money is QoS and to keep the user experience uniform/stream lined. You can initiate the payout process as soon as a buyer has paid. That's not what I'd call an escrow service. They don't care about when a payment is made because if one party defrauds the other the issue is handled according to civil law after the fact.
