This got me into using changetip, feels nice to send $1 so freaking easily. BTC for the win!!!

This Trezor is great, exactly what I've been looking for, I don't think it's very expensive either. I spend more on cigarette's in a week.

Why don't you just worry about every possible bad thing that can happen to you... Jesus man, get bent.

Super cool man, good work.

I'm on the same path as you, well done man.

I changed my mind and actually like you now, you remind me of my little brother, always trying to get a rise out of people. Aww you so cute.

I don't have kids, and I'm keeping it somewhere safe... like a safe.

Not at all, just showing off my Trezor. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:40:13
Yep there is a web wallet that works with the hardware. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:35:12
These tips seem pointless, I appreciate the thought tho.

I think it took a little over a week for me to get mine from when I ordered it... I live in Canada.

I feel honored that I have found the first person that annoys me on Reddit. I feel part of the community now.

YOu get a 24 word code you can get your wallet back if you lose or break your Trezor.

Do you ever contribute anything worth while to a conversation? Or do you just drop sarcastic remarks and poke people with sticks?

I would never leave anything in a safety deposit box at the bank.

I'm really happy with my Trezor.

I purchased 3.65 BTC today. I look at it the same way as the precious metals I buy.
I still save Fiat, but I have no faith in that system. I do have faith in Gold, Silver and BTC tho. Saving for the long haul. I don't day trade, I save. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:16:45
You guys are inspiring me to go get some more. I have 6, and I'll go get another 4 today.
I'm used to watching markets like this, I've been investing in gold and silver for years and have watched them dump in the markets despite the fundamentals. I'm pretty young and can wait it out. I have a nice fiat stash sitting around, but I think another grand into bitcoin won't hurt.

Is this why it took a long time for the 3.6 BTC I purchased today to get Verified? (Serious question)
@_date: 2015-01-11 01:57:50
I have a Trezor, I love it to. NO problems. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:41:55
It took me a minute to realize the genius of this thread. I have chuckled deeply. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:17:06
Could probably break your usb port as well pushing the trezor up and down like that, cable is best for sure.

Buttcoiners are gonna love this.
