Such colorful writing, Andreas.  I was with you every step of the way.  Thank you for sharing and all you give to the community.  Of course you deserve every bit and more to come.

Well I agree they are not responsible for solving but they could be accurate with their guidance and possibly even direct users to possible solutions and reminder not to use the same BTC address going forward.

sent me my coins.  This has been a bit of a nightmare as I had many BCH sitting out there.  Some have questioned his approach but I feel very fortunate that the first person to figure this out was honest enough to give back the majority of coins.  I would have never imagined my coins could have been spent without access to my private key. This experience has forced me to learn about segwit which is good but I must say has left a bad taste. I'll hodl my BTC in legacy addresses from now on so I don't have to worry about this kind of user error or anyone else figuring out how to exploit segwit.

I'm affected but need help with my recovery request. I have my BTC Segwit "3" address and can get current BCH best block hash.  I have my BCH "1" address as input.  My private key is in an Exodus wallet and I can export it.  I'm stuck after that. Is there a command line? Really appreciate someone's help here.

Heard back from Ledger on this. Disappointing they would discard desperate customers requesting help.

Hello ,
First make sure you know the BTC address type (Legacy or Segwit) you sent your BCH to : 
If you sent BCH to a BTC Legacy address
You will find them in your BCH main account if you sent your BCH on a Bitcoin Legacy address.
If you sent BCH to a BTC Segwit address
Your BCH are lost as long as Bitcoin Cash doesn't support Segwit.
Best regards,
Ledger Customer Support

The powers controlling this sell off want complete capitulation and then they will start buying. If you are still feeling at all hopeful then you are not where they want you yet.
