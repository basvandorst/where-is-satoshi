Byrne says they pay 2% for credit cards, and an "undisclosed" amount to Coinbase for BTC processing.
As a consumer, who does not care at all about Bitcoin from an ideological perspective, there is absolutely no reason to pay 1% to acquire Bitcoins to save 1% at Overstock.

The app is targeted at people travelling or remitting money, from all of the companies' own promotion.
Using it as a bank account because you're unbanked would require you to pay a fee every time you deposit, withdraw, and meet strangers every time you need cash. Instead of just hanging on to the cash yourself. This just doesn't make any sense at all.

What fundamental growth? A few big merchants added BitPay as a payment processor. No one is using bitcoin to buy things from them. The usage of Bitcoin for it's supposed "killer apps", remittance, microtransactions, and a "store of value", is non-existent.

The only meaningful comparison is to purchasing power, average wages, etc. And there are numerous other factors beside monetary inflation:


Gas was cheap and easy to extract in 1974. The world was awash in oil. The North Sea, Saudis, OPEC, etc. Now it's harder to find and more expensive to produce. The Reagen era of cheap gas (literally $10-$20 a barrel) is fucking over. Forever.
Food prices? The primary input is petroleum. etc. etc.

Western Union has a physical infrastructure that Bitcoin can't even begin to approach for years if not decades, fiat to fiat, and fees that scale with the size of the transfer. Bitcoin is cheaper for small amounts of money, yes, MUCH cheaper; but this is a niche use case that still leaves the recipient with the problem of turning a small amount of Bitcoin into cash, which is basically impossible. Nobody is meeting you from localbitcoins, even if there are buyers/sellers, to trade $5.

Wow, Bitcoin users are clueless. WU provides cash to cash transfer. Bitcoin does not. Wu serves the unbanked. When asked how to get bit coins, Bitcoin users reply "use coin base or circle!".... Requires banks. western union is a trusted brand ; the Bitcoin alternative is localbitcoins, dealing with totally random unknowns. Bitcoin users compare apples and oranges, btc to btc, instead of apples to apples, fiat to fiat. Why? Because fiat to fiat is not cheaper or easier with btc. Using western union requires understanding fiat money, using Bitcoin requires tech savvy.

BitPay and Overstocks numbers indicates that Bitcoin transactions are stagnant/dropping. Reuters reported the actual amount of Bitcoin commerce is ~$2.3 million a day, and this has been flat the entire year.

Because that doesn't make any sense at all. Airports are generally monopoly concessions. They charge exorbitant rents. Those costs are passed on to the punters; currency exchange is ludicrously expensive, as is food, drink, and everything else. 
A BTM would have the same costs, with pitiful volume because the  number of people who own bitcoin is tiny, and the number of people who actually spend/use their bitcoin is *vanishingly* small; 75% of coins have not moved for at least 6 months. Because volumes are so low, the machine would be quite expensive, so even the small pool of possible users would not use it, so the operators would go bankrupt; or it would be cheap, not having any real hope of recouping costs due to slim or negative margins, and go bankrupt.

Yes, because fiat currency is not intended to be a store of value. This is like saying your fridge is a better place to store food than your car.
That's why everyone with an ounce of common sense, unlike libertarians, invests their money if they intend it to hold or increase in value. In things like real estate and equities.

No, Bitcoin is designed to *not* be invested. You sit there and watch your Bitcoins go up in value, without investing them. Inflation forces you to invest your money, as otherwise it will lose value over time.
"Investment" is often going to be in companies that actively stoke "consumer spending obsessions" - Apple, AliBaba, Amazon, etc.

That's nice, but it's not.

*All* of your money? Don't bitcoiners recommend keeping only a small portion of your bitcoins in a hot/phone wallet, and the rest in cold non internet connected storage?

Wow, where to begin.
People in the 3rd world aren't on the fucking Internet. That's part of what makes it the 3rd world. For example, according to this Al-Jazeera article, [1/3 of the world's population]( is on the Internet. 1/3rd. That's 4 billion+ people who are not online. Quote:


People in rural Africa, Bolivia and Mongolia are not going to be selling you crafts on Bitcoin Etsy for $40 shipping a pop. If they *could*, which they *can't*, a tiny number of people are going to shell out for that.
How many people outside of North America and Europe use bitcoins? Seriously. How many? "But China uses Bitcoin!" China is just about the biggest economy in the world and has a huge and growing, global income level middle class. Bitcoin is a toy for tech savvy, middle class people in rich countries with broadband Internet and smart phones.

So, honest question: In a scenario like this, what is to stop a person from "paying" with a malicious wallet app that sends bitcoins from a some valid address to the restauraunt, while the valid address does not have enough bitcoins to cover the tab? The address has either zero bitcoins or some microscopic amount.
With zero confirmations, there is no way of knowing that the person paying has *actually* paid, correct? You would have to wait for the network/mining pools to reject the transaction as invalid?

Possibly, people want to feel like the resources are donating are going to the stated purpose. For example, if you donate to a charity that spends all of its resources on administration, not on the people or cause it is meant to aid, then that's upsetting and rightfully so. I mean, that is the libertarian argument against government, partly, it's incredible wasteful and inefficient and bureaucratic and so on.
Now, if you are donating money to help homeless people, and you discover that said homeless people actually have the resources to feed themselves, but rather choose to spend the disposable income they have on energy drinks and cigarettes, well, you might feel that your donations are actually going to subsidize those items. Which is not what you had in mind.

These organizations transmit cash to cash. As you pointed out in your point, the unbankeed/poor "operate in cash based societies". Bitcoin to bitcoin transfer is useless for a cash based society. To compare apples to apples, you should compare cash to cash transfer. If BTC are purchased at an ATM that charges 4.75%, like the one in Vancouver, and then exchanged back into cash at the same rate, you've just paid 10%. Cheaper than Western Union's 12.4% (?), but certainly not free.
"These organizations" have overheads - rent, insurance, wages, exchange rate hedging/expenses, etc. - that BTC-based remittance will also have were a similar service available. ie, ATM fees.

Merchants are paying 1% to BitPay. Merchants pay from 1-6% on credit card transactions, from what I can tell. Large merchants, the ones you guys are currently crowing about getting accepted by, can already negotiate better agreements that independent merchants. Additionally, they are selling these gift cards to Gyft at a discount, probably because they know that many, many gift cards will forever have an unused balance, perhaps a few pennies or perhaps a few dollars.

Your logic is completely circular. These things have intrinsic value, because the people who consider them valuable can send them to each other.

And regarding c, bitcoin would make it even *easier* to embezzle money anonymously.. that's a good thing?
