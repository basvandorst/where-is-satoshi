Isn't hashgraph proprietary and owned by one company, not open source? Really, that's what these people think will win? Silly.

Wow bro, you dumb.

The "can't receive payments" thing is the only reason I haven't moved over to bech32 and adoption is moving a crazy slow pace. Frustrating.

Did you not write down the seed?

The woman that created Monopoly intended it to be a lesson in the systemic failures of capitalism. So rule  fits right in with that.

Fair point.

Recently I've been experimenting with 1sat per byte transactions on things I had no immediate need to complete. My last one took 4 days, BTW. I'd like to see edge cases like that, maybe as an advance feature or something on a second page, so as not to mess up your UX. Also, there is a feature with the blockstream explorer that I find really cool. When a transaction gets displayed it shows you how much you could save as a percentage by using segwit or bech32 segwit. Not sure how relevant that is to what you are doing but I thought the education that that provides is valuable.

Not sure if the Cash App debit card qualifies, because you can't send BTC to it, but you can transfer Fiat to it, purchase BTC and hold until you want to convert back and spend.

Oh also, replace by fee. I've never used it but it would be good to educate people on available fees technologies.

Yes, this. The criticism came from a very influential core Dev so I was sad when I heard it. But after digging into it some more, the same comments can be leveled at any lightweight client not connected to your own full node. So I still consider this wallet in the top three available for mobile. It's still my go to wallet.

In my experience you will pay about 1% over spot price on Coinbase Pro. The fee is backed into the spread. This is still a great deal though. I highly recommend Cash App.

Under an older address scheme you would keep one address for multiple transactions. Under the newer (HD) wallet scheme you get a new address for every transaction which is then compiled by your wallet software to appear as an compiled amount. This is done for security, in case one address is comprised, the attacker would hit a dead end at that particular address. Paper wallets are a really bad idea when combined with the newer wallet protocols.
