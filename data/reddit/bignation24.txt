I narrated events avoiding to blame Justin or anyone. This is a public opinion court to make up my mind concerning my suspicion about the broker actions.

Thanks for uploading the link. I remembered reading that same post and concluded that trading with CFDs did not equate to ownership of Bitcoin and since I was not having Bitcoin private keys to the positions. I did not get any guidance on IG website or received email about their policy. IG had since updated crypto currency statement on their website.

Tax was paid on the real profit but the Austrian authorities do not accept paid borrowing costs and transaction taxes to be factored into the tax calculations. This means taxes were paid everywhere making the trader to work for almost nothing.

Now I got better insights to mindset of many people commenting negatively on this article. It seems hardcore followers of Bitcoin are afraid of regulations that may drive down the value of Bitcoin, preventing it from ever rising to I million dollar per Bitcoin. I am a believer that Bitcoin is a gift of the most high for this generation to at least reduce total enslavement of humanity through monopoly of world finances by established players. That said, the government can not erase this new age currency anymore but they will win and keep control of it. Everyone is advised to wake up to that reality. Governments do not give up their Kingdoms. That is the world order unless another new world order takes over. A new world order is approaching. The millennium new world order of peace that shall be ushered in through love, unity and kindness. That is why knowledge to create Bitcoin was released to this generation to break away borders and barriers. I am an adopter of Bitcoin by fate. I embrace the bright future it brings but wisdom and calm is needed to navigate through this upcoming global war of finance. To proud and insulting investors commenting about my pain, hold on tight. The ship of this financial world will rock. Enjoy the ride. My fall is sweet lesson for me because it opened my eyes to see the upcoming freedom and glory. For those that think their smartness will win always. Remove pride, be humble, calm, nice and gentle. A word is enough for the wise. End of story

I got myself a Ledger Wallet and hold minimal amount of crypto after the fork. Part of my narration was to make clear that it takes time to acquire adequate information and get prepared. Mr. Justin knew of my lack of interest for Bitcoin and I suspected he deliberately wanted me to trade Bitcoin ahead of the fork, knowing fully well that time is needed to fully understand the technology and be aware of the fork conditions.

Translating day trading to greed is very impolite. Anyone hoping to make profit trading online is greedy in your world.

Thanks for uploading above link. That was fair and correct from Bittrex. Unfortunately, I was not having a Bittrex account at that time and I had not started visiting forums.

Do not come to conclusion about what is not fully revealed to you yet. The reason behind it all will still be made known. A puzzle needs to be completed before full understanding.

I blamed nobody. Read the post. When goodness is taken for weakness. It is best to investigate and be sure of what happened before making a final conclusion. I suspected what Justin had done for his company and IG. This post is partly to hear the court of public opinion for learning. I learn from the few good people that make well meaning and intelligent comments. A split second bad decision may sometimes occur to anyone and be difficult to reverse. Especially when games are running. It is all part of life. Most people shall encounter failure on something through their life. We are all on a learning process. If you laugh when someone slips, watch your back because your fall will happen where you did not expect in spite of your great smartness.
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:39:32
That is overpaying taxes not avoidance of paying taxes. Transaction taxes and income taxes were paid. Expenses was not allowed to be factored in. This reduced profit or take home to almost nothing.
@_date: 2018-09-01 12:06:48
Relevance is that Mr. Justin was employing a dumb excuse to visit me in Vienna from London, to get close, to win my trust, then edge me on afterwards to trade with a volatile instrument. These shortly before masses of events that can confuse even the experienced. My account was growing prior to that time as I was accumulating gains through scalping with Forex positions. Introduction of Bitcoin was probably hoped to cause over trading or create situation that will blow up the portfolio. It was not necessary to write out every detail in the post. My experiences may benefit another trader someday concerning Market maker brokerages and possible games. Part of reason why this article was posted.

Too dumb to fully understand what was written in the post. That does not help you or anyone thinking too smart of themselves. Understand the story or logic of holding on to positions that was sure to reverse. It was clear that hype, manipulation FOMO etc was making Bitcoin to rise artificially last year. It was sure to correct and stay down, hence I needed to hold my positions. When margin requirement was corrected from 12.5% to 100%, a condition I had not reckoned with when opening the positions, I had to give up. Beside, I shorted because vital information were withheld. Making money sometimes depend on many factors, luck included. Having enough capital for investment at the right time or receiving the right information etc. Anyone with enough capital in 2009 could have simply invested and ride the tide up. Now that the stock market is kept at its peak and Bitcoin is in no mans land. Why did you all not use your genius brains to make millions. You got in on something early before others and acquired experience, not having someone trying to trip you around while you are learning. Great you are lucky but that does not make others stupid. Great men learn through failures to rise to great heights. The secret and moral of this story will be revealed at the right time. Insulting fools without feelings should keep their comment to themselves.

I plan to sue IG or at least complain to the authorities which might help improve policies and trading conditions in future. Thanks for your comments

Bitcoin drop and failure to rise to such heights since then is proof that I was not wrong.

Mr Justin introduced CFD to me as better alternatives to trading British and france stocks where high transaction taxes are being charged. Transaction taxes are not regarded as part of investment costs in Austria. I was looking for ways to trade without it. I was made to pay extra high taxes on profit made when I filed my 2016 report with the Austrian tax authorities. They had not recognized the massive transaction taxes I paid trading on UK and France stocks. Searching for a solution or advise led me to Guardian Stockbrokers which I consulted for advise. Mr Peter and Justin recommended CFD and IG as solution for short term position trading to me. The rest is history being read on this forum.

Very useful advise. This is part of the reason why I posted this story. I waited to allow situations around Bitcoin to play itself out more clearly. Example is about Tether and allegations of it being used by a specific exchange for pump and dumps. Other evidences are still being gathered. Anyone who know a good lawyer to work on this kind of case is invited to recommend. Anyone that may have been damaged in such a manner is also invited to join me in the case. Thanks for your comments.

Investigating and asking for advise is being translated to mean blame. Read following article for more understanding

I like some of the points you are making. It is answering my suspicion that Mr Justin deliberately introduced me to Bitcoin few weeks ahead of several forks that was known by experienced traders to generate high volatility. By keeping vital information that may help take correct decision hidden from me, chances of loss became high. It was Mr Justin pushing Bitcoin my way prior to a period of high volatility. I was trading safely with other CFD instruments before that time. I am of the opinion that hype was deliberately generated last year while newcomers were being invited deliberately by experienced brokers to trade on Bitcoin ahead of the fork. The goal in my own opinion was for experienced traders who were aware of the conditions and stocking up positions to increase their gains. Those were not fair conditions of trading and investment in my own opinion. In my own opinion, those traders encouraged and brainwashed others into holding positions with predictions (the Hodling word) that Bitcoin will rise forever. They cashed out at the top and left the inexperienced traders with little value for their money. That is the same reason why Bitcoin in not able to reach those heights anymore no matter the amount of pumping and dumping. If I am correct, it might take years or it may never happen that enough newcomers will be found to help pump Bitcoin in that way. I accept earlier tech adopters were smart but this does not translate to mean that others are fools.
@_date: 2018-09-01 00:09:10
No one you listed has been blamed in my post. I raised my opinion that manipulation must have happened last year on Bitcoin. You are invited to dispute that manipulations do not happen on Bitcoin. That is the reason of this post. I suspect that most negative comments may come from Bitcoin fans that wants to defend its existence and credibility. Not everyone is a genius like you guys.
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:11:01
Take time to read my post and understand that I did due diligence on Bitcoin before I invested. I am of the opinion that some actors behind the scene were able to deliberately keep Bitcoin fork conditions a secret. You are invited to come up with publications about Bitcoin fork conditions before it happened. I understood the platform. I was not aware of tiered margin and that it can be applied on already opened positions.
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:09:26
Guys not reading the post to full understanding before they comment
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:28:22
My mindset was to invest, not speculate. I had two years intensive practice running stock trading accounts with profits before I opened CFD trading accounts with IG. I held my positions without losing my money and made gains. I am sure the money would not be lost under normal circumstances but I met abnormal conditions. Events that had never happened played together and worked against me.
I borrowed the project money for a reason that can not be explained here. I will open a website in future and publish the reason there. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:46:22
I invite you to kindly publish information that was made public about Bitcoin cash fork condition before it happened and became public knowledge.
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:57:03
Hard core followers of Bitcoin had the information probably through forums and chatrooms but not newcomers. Send some of the publications prior to BCH fork here.
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:42:46
IG emailed customers ahead of Bitcoin fork concerning conditions but left me out claiming it was a mistake. I believed it was done deliberately in my own opinion. Information is power and key to taking correct decisions in trading. Whoever possess information may deny others access for profit or make others lose.
IG credited me with negative Bitcoin Cash positions claiming that such rule are also being applied on stocks that are shorted through ex-dividend dates.
