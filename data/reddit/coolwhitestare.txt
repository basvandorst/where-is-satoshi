And where is Weiss in that article?

Yup.  That's the one that keeps me awake at night too.

And just like the fools that buy paper gold, the fools that buy this crap are creating inflation in what SHOULD be uninflatable.  Gotta hand it to the guys who sat around and got people to invest in it though.

While I disagree with your ultimate decision to let others hold your bitcoins for you, I support the thought of diversity.  But why not just hold multiple cold storage wallets instead?   Anyway, good luck to you.

If we could worry less about blocksize and RBF and worry more that Wall Street has actually succeeded in selling pieces of paper that are supposed to represent bitcoin ownership, what a wonderful world it would be.

Just like the day will (hopefully) come when Gold ETFs will be exposed as being backed by air, we would need a similar event to bring "if you don't control it, you don't own it" to the forefront. (Sad thing is we already HAD one with MtGox). I can even understand how paper gold developed, because storing bullion safely can be a pain.  But who are these people who want to invest in BTC without actually owning any?  Mindboggling.   This will get worse with bitcoin derivatives soon to follow.  Sigh.

Always, ALWAYS fade this guy.  No better proof than price action since his tweet.

I suspect many Greeks "knew how to use a computer" in June and July.  How'd that work out for them?

Yes!  The Russian Minister = the killer app!

But you don't hold the Bitcoin.  You hold a share certificate in a fund that claims to hold bitcoins.

And keep in mind that deep down in the bowels of the prospectus for your ETF, that they are probably allowed to not actually be fully invested in BTC.  At least this is common language in the precious metal ETFs.  Caveat emptor!

Congrats to Wall Street for figuring out a way to inflate BTC supply.  I should be surprised that anybody would invest in a BTC ETF, but the public lost their capacity to surprise me a long time ago.

Not sure, but instead of bickering over blocksize it would be nice to see some unity from the big names to see this as a major threat.  Letting Wall Street print pieces of paper that say you're invested in BTC is just so bad for us on so many levels.  Maybe Andreas to the rescue???
