I don't doubt you think you read that because of the utter nonsense that gets posted in this sub but you are incorrect.
The S2X fork was called off over a month ago.
The fork you are referencing is [United Bitcoin]( 
It is developed but the same person (who botched the code for S2X) but is a completely different fork with different objectives and does not have the same people supporting it as S2X did.


Maybe you should so you don't spread misinformation.

As opposed to the centralisation of LN nodes right? Do you even have a clue how LN works or what it takes to run a LN node? Or even open a LN channel?
I agree that larger blocks are not the solution in themselves but believe larger blocks and 2nd layer solutions are the solution (you know not as currently deployed anywhere). Not everyone needs to run a node, this was covered in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:43:00
LN channels are settled on the blockchain, LN transactions are not.
To open a LN channel you need to tie up your BTC in the channel so your LN channel is only ever going to be able to process the sum of the bitcoins used to open it.
So unless you have hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins you're not going to be running a LN hub. Not one that going to be of any use anyway.

Well you mentioned trading which is why I mentioned it, if you're just buying and holding then not really. The current state of scaling is a shit show.
The best option for now IMHO is to sign up with Coinbase, transfer the cash you deposit to GDAX (Coinbase's trading platform), buy coins there then transfer from GDAX to your wallet. The reason this works is because GDAX will pay the network fee to get your coins into your wallet.
If I'm honest I can see Coinbase changing this policy if the current high fees continue as it will be costing them a shit load of money.

Mining difficulty is based on the amount of hashrate. So the more hashrate that gets added the more difficult it gets. This is true across all mineable coins. So while coin price may go up as more hashrate is added the chance of you mining some drops. It's a self balancing system for the most part.

And BCH can handle 8x the load BTC can currently.


You mean the same one the reference client maintained by the very same developers that pushed for segwit didn't support for months after activation?


No, if it was under the same load it would be 8x more efficient.


I agree that LN is likely the solution for scaling in BTC but it's been in development hell for years already with no chance of being deployed any time soon.


Yes, scaling is hard. I never denied that.


I've not said anything about the "true vision of Satoshi", please don't put words in my mouth. It's a bullshit appeal to authority argument idiots use.


What bugs were these? It hit a hard limit, not a bug.


Yes, and as usual the truth is somewhere in the middle. BTC will need a blocksize increase at some point (some say it's overdue) but the way it was approached by the big blockers was the wrong way of doing it. The entire scaling debate was handled badly on both sides because people repeatedly saw it as a black or white issue.


I agree, but again I've not said that, ever.

Sorry, how does copyright prevent you from using your hardware in any way you like? You seem to be conflating copyright and DRM.


Just because copying is easy doesn't give you the moral right to copy and give someone else's work away for free, it is up to the author of the work to decide how that work is distributed. There certainly has been anti consumer moves made by the US gov in the name of appeasing copyright holders but this is largely limited to the US.


Your argument is that a content creators right to make a living off their product is trumped by your right to give their product away for free? This is something I do not agree with.


This is an argument against corporatism, not copyright. Copyright is being extended far longer than justifiable IMHO copyright should last until the author (or last author in a group) dies.


This is just patently false, if this were true indie films, music, game etc... would never be made.

How long are you talking? Wallet to wallet I'm assuming meaning from Coinbase wallet to your private wallet (phone/hardware/etc...).
Any on chain transaction is going to take at least the length of time it takes to mine a single block (usually 10 mins give or take for BTC) for it to be confirmed at 1 block depth, most wallets or merchants may require more depth (more mined blocks after the first one).

So you won't trust a hardware wallet that is basically impossible to open without it being obvious but you'll download some software to do the conversion for you?

There is a limit on how much you can deposit per day. But let's make the maths simple. Let's say you have a $60 per hour deposit limit (can only deposit $60 per hour) which is calculated per minute.
Minute 0: You deposit $60 so your $60 limit has been used up  
Minute 1: Your limit is recalculated and you can now deposit $1  
Minute 2: Limit recalculated, can deposit $2  
...  
Minute 10: Limit recalculated, can deposit $10  
...  
Minute 60: Limit recalculated, can deposit $60  
Minute 61: Limit not used, still $60

That seems like an overly long time, that said there is some odd mining power shit going on right now with miner flip flopping between BCH and BTC causing blocks to take much longer than usual (meaning blocks take longer to mine, less blocks = less transactions) which may have affected your transactions.
As for anything you can do to make it quicker Coinbase already uses high fees (higher fees mean your transaction is more likely to be selected by a miner) so paying a higher fee would be unlikely to help, as for mining it yourself this is practically impossible (for someone without a mining farm).
I'm by no means an expert and I may be wrong but my guess is you got caught up the hashing power shenanigans unluckily, my Coinbase transfers usually confirm within an hour or less.

Nope, no /s.
You need to restart the system for kernel updates, you may also need to restart services if libraries have updated and services haven't restarted (this can be done without a reboot).
As it's a rPI I would assume you're using rasbian which should create a file when a reboot is needed after an update you can check this by running `ls /var/run/reboot-required` if the file exists then you need to reboot to complete updates, if it doesn't then you don't. Another tool you can use is `checkrestart` from the `debian-goodies` package (`apt-get install debian-goodies`) which will check if you need to restart services and/or reboot.
This is also assuming you are running `apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade` regularly, obviously if you're not actually installing updates then you don't need to reboot. Though running without updates is usually a bad idea.

Any wallet to wallet transaction is on chain so would need to be mined. It may be that blockchain.com used a lower fee which may have slowed things down (I've never used it so have no idea what fees they use). Gdax is owned by Coinbase so likely uses higher fees so may be a little quicker.

As I've stated elsewhere the conspiracy tard masses caught up in this wouldn't believe the proof even if he was reciting the lords prayer in klingon with a sock on his head at 4k. Even if he popped up near a window they would claim it was all a Kevin McCallister Home alone style ruse.

No, I call them that because they are actually nutjobs. If there is something shady going on then speculating with ZERO goddamned evidence isn't actually helping anything other than making themselves look like nutjobs.


No but it does require getting it off the device you signed it with to the internet, not impossible sure but when it's nutters demanding it why take the time out of your busy schedule?


Literally one and the same from what I've read in the assange and pizzagate sub.

The way you are describing it could be misconstrued as a "feature" of the coin which it is not.

Debit cards are very different to credit cards and the article you linked groups their usage. Debit card usage in the UK is higher than credit card usage by a large amount, especially for daily purchases like sandwiches. I would put money on this being the same across the rest of Europe.






So 1B CC transactions a quarter vs. 1.3 DC transactions in a month, that's 4x as many debit card payments than on credit cards.

I agree that a large proportion of people are dumber than rocks or willfully ignorant when it comes to tech but berating them for requiring support from a company that sucks at support helps no one.
Coinbase is pretty much the defacto crypto on ramp for people and not being able to provide an acceptable level of support is going to turn people off of crypto.

I use Coinbase. Depending how much you buy at once depends on the most efficient way to do things.
I use SEPA transfers (Euro transfers in effect), for me they cost a flat £10 with NatWest so after I think it's after about £500 a time then it's less fees to do a SEPA transfer at £10 then transfer the money to my GDAX account and buy at the market price.
This does mean you have to wait a few business days for the money to clear into Coinbase's account so you can't act immediately on a price change.
I guess it depends how much you're doing on a regular basis, if it's more than £500 a month then use SEPA then GDAX, if not then just use Coinbase with their fees.
Note, check the £500 figure I think it's about there but might need double checking.

It's literally the easiest way for a complete crypto noob to buy BTC/ETH/LTC, sure it's not the best due to their crazy fees but it is the easiest.
If you think people who mention or even praise Coinbase are paid shills you're clearly delusional. People like convenience and ease of use, they recommend them because they have had a good experience with them.

A hardware wallet is exactly as secure as a paper wallet when not in active use (arguably more so if your paper wallet is just unencrypted seed words).
The advantages of a hardware wallet however is that you are able to use it as a wallet and not just a vault.
To use any coins in your paper wallet you have to sweep it into a software wallet then spend then sweep back into a new paper wallet. To do this you also need to ensure the security of the computer you are using, hardware wallets mitigate this by being the secure device, not the computer.
The way I see wallets is:
Phone/computer/online wallet - akin to your normal wallet, you use it day to day and keep a minimum amount in. If you lose it/it gets compromised it's annoying but not the end of the world.
Hardware wallet - more like your bank account, more secure than your wallet but still easily accessable day to day, you keep as decent amount in here, enough to live off for a few months, you top your phone wallet up from here.
Paper wallet - a bank safe deposit box, or a safe, rarely used, more for long term storage, very secure but a hassle to use for day to day transactions.
It all depends on your needs.

Docker is as well code reviewed as any software you run on your computer.


Docker is as secure as the system it runs on and how it is configured. It is an abstraction layer.


Running bitcoind inside a container (built or downloaded from a source you trust) is no more insecure than running bitcoind on your computer.
If you run bitcoind on its own on your computer any other processes have access to bitcoind. If you run bitcoind within a docker container on your server any other process has access to bitcoind and docker (this is slightly simplified as it ignores any OS level permissions but let's ignore that for a second as it's not relevant).
Docker cannot open any attack vectors into bitcoind, and bitcoind running in a container can't introduce any into Docker.
Some docker basics:
Docker is about process isolation, not isolation from the host but isolation from other processes. This is done by each container sharing the host machines kernel but having their own userland (everything except the kernel, think libraries and other programs).
You build a docker image by setting starting from a base image, this is usually a bare bones Linux distro (layer1). Once you have your base you install your dependencies (layer2, this is your libraries), then you add your program (layer3).
So to run bitcoind you use a verified base image, let's say Ubuntu 16.04 directly from Canonical, then you install the dependencies (from the Ubuntu repos), the you add in the official bitcoind binary.
As you can see this is essentially the exact see steps you would take to run bitcoind on any Linux server, all a container is is a wrapper around everything you need to run bitcoind on any system running docker.
Now you have an image you can run it on any Linux system with docker, as with the binary it's is only as secure as the system it is running on.
With a properly secured system both are as secure as each other, if someone is on the docker host it's insecure, if someone is on your server it's insecure.
At worst someone on your local machine can get into your container and affect the bitcoind process, but if they are on your local machine you're fucked if you're just running bitcoind on its own.

FOSS = Free and Open Source Software
In this case the process is listed in the repo [CONTRIBUTING.md]( file.
Giving this file a quick read it is pretty much the standard work flow for any open source project which boils down to:
0. Clone repo
0. Make changes
0. Make pull request
0. Code is merged if it passes peer review*
\* A technical review; As in, does this do what it says, is it safe etc... not a review of whether something is worth doing (like segwit or a block size increase).
As with all code bases major changes are best discussed before making code changes this is to make sure the changes are in line with the project. Of course having some code to backup your ideas isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Yes, that's how docker works.


No, you setup the first container incorrectly. You mount a volume/dir from the host into the container as data storage so when you update the container to a new version you don't lose your data.
Sounds like you have zero idea of how to run docker in anything resembling a production way. I would suggest learning about it before blaming it for your own mistakes.


Docker containers are verified on download (they are downloaded in layers, each checked with a checksum) you have to trust the source however. If you don't trust the source compile the code and build the container yourself.
Docker isn't the issue here, running code you haven't verified yourself is.

All of those CVEs require access to the local machine, the docker API or malicious containers to be run. All those attack vectors are covered by building your own container and securing your system properly.
As I said in my previous posts, you should build the container yourself or download from a trusted source, exactly the same advice as running software from unknown sources.
Could you be compromised by running some random container you found online? Sure, just like you could be compromised by running any random software you download from the internet that you can't check the provenance of.

That's not how hacking works. Someone having your IP doesn't magically enable them to "brute force" their way in.
First you need a port open, then the software behind that port needs to be vulnerable to an exploit (it would have to be a remote code vulnerability to be of much use), then once they can run code they are limited to the user permissions on that system for the user running the code, so they would likely need to escalate their privileges to root/admin (not always necessary).
Even after all that they are now on one machine and they need to move laterally within the network, so they scan the network to find open ports on other computers and repeat the above process.
Or they could just get you to run malicious JavaScript or download something via your browser and let you do all the hard work.

Is it $300 total or $300 per machine?

Yup, that's exactly my point. I should have probably put /s at the end.
People are bitching because a handful of people control the ASIC game without being willing to risk anything to change that fact.

The shocking lack of knowledge of cryptography in this sub still continues to astound me.

A company that has implemented 2FA is going to be salting and hashing passwords. Yes this is an assumption but it's one based on the fact they are a company that is very concerned with security.
@_date: 2017-07-07 19:40:40
No I mean that the IRS isn't in the habit of cracking passwords. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:51:22
Haha, yes I did. Passive heating would be a terrible idea.

No really it wouldn't. If you honestly think the IRS have cracked or even brute forced any Coinbase passwords you're an idiot.

Then why isn't your argument for someone to design and build their own ASIC miners? With all the hate Jihan gets in here I'm sure you could find enough people to crowdfund it's development and production.

Not everything can be solved by throwing more servers at it. Code that works fine for X users per second may fail at Y users per second in new and unexpected ways. Scaling is a really hard problem and it's not one you can just throw developers/more compute at.

If you can get your xpub from your ledger you can use [Sentinel]( which will allow you to monitor your ledger wallet balance and generate new pub addresses.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:08:24
Which has nothing to do with buying or selling. Please try again.

Not sure there are any that would let you spend from a ledger, I could of course be wrong as I've not looked into the ledger as I have a trezor.

Exactly. You deal with the source of the problem not the symptoms. Ending over a century of fucking with the middle east would be a good start.

It backs up your encrypted secrets, even if someone gets a copy of that backup they still need the passphrase to decrypt it.
There is a world of difference.
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:04:52
Not as far as I'm aware, when I activated it it immediately asked for a passphrase. Not sure you can even disable it.
Edit: Just checked. You have to enter a password, no option to disable it when setting backups.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:44:22
All coins traded on GDAX are held by Coinbase this is evidenced by the lack of transfer fees between GDAX and Coinbase, same with any fiat. It's all held by Coinbase.
So while you can't buy anything on Coinbase when it's down you can still trade freely on GDAX which has exactly the same effect as buying/selling on Coinbase. So in relation to the conspiracy theory that Coinbase are doing it to make money it's provably untrue. But who needs logic when people can make up utter nonsense.

"IT guy" ranges from some kid installing antivirus at best buy all the way through to people who run globally distributed systems. As you stated "IT Guy" not "Distributed systems developer" or "Technical Architect" I'm going to assume you're somewhere nearer the Best Buy tech end and have zero experience either building or running anything more than a handful of servers.
The 600% growth in the last month is unprecidented and not something you can suddenly fix when it comes out of nowhere. This isn't anything like a "global economy shift" this is going from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.
Scaling software is one of the hardest things in IT and it takes time, ask Google, or Amazon their engineers literally wrote the book on it. The month to six weeks in which this massive surge has happened is barely even 3 sprints in a dev cycle, even if they had the best engineers in the world that is not something that can be done in that time period.
You're free to use any other exchange you like however, Coinbase have continually failed during times of high traffic, could they have done more? Maybe; The real question is why do you keep using them? Only an idiot would carry on using something that's continually let them down or cost them money. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:26:25
It would surprise me if they ever kept unencrypted backups, that would be insane especially for a "security" product.

Yet another well thought out and reasoned post.
Oh wait no, yet more echo chamber rabble rousing. What is the point of this post? Literally everyone in this sub already agrees with you, you're not providing any new information and you're not actually explaining why your argument is vaild or how it has merit.
I don't disagree with you but this post is literally bottom of the barrel, you're not helping the conversation, you're not educating newcomers, and you're not making any attempt to even back up your arguments which might convince someone on the other side of the fence to change their mind. Sure people should research things and learn for themselves but this post isn't going to trigger that in people it's going to trigger posts like [this]( where people are more confused by this low effort bullshit.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:53:09
The feature is designed to counter votes snowballing (both up and down) due to bandwagoning and obfuscate swings either way which leads to - in theory - more open discussions. It's used by literally thousands of subreddits, what exactly is your problem with it?
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:10:07
That or thousands of other people had the same idea when the price started dropping meaning there are now thousands of people trying to use their website. They are the most well known exchange in the business, it's where literally every new person ends up to buy bitcoins so of course it fails under a 600%+ increase of traffic. You people need to keep off the coolaid and learn a bit about scaling a complex web service. That or go use a different exchange.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:47:40
Dump a shit load of coins, say 50,000 at $2500 ($125m) wait for others to panic and drive the price down further to $2000 then rebuy 62,500 coins for the same price. Numbers used for illustration only obviously.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:11:53
You're not relying on on any services from Google Authenticator or Authy to have access to your coins. They are simply application that implement the 2FA standard which use a shared secret (between you and coinbase) to generate one time passwords, neither GA or Authy require or use any services other than the app on your phone. 2FA massively increases security over just a username/password no matter how little you have stored on an exchange.

You've clearly never worked on a codebase that has had to scale by orders of magnitude with little to no warning. This isn't a defence of Coinbase it's the cold hard reality of trying to scale.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:43:23
Sorry I should have qualified that with "and expect it to be fixed quickly". Long term the developers can make the codebase scalable (which will mean more servers) but you can't just throw more resources at it and have it fixed quicker, it's not a pile of bricks that can be moved quicker with more people.
One of the hardest problems in software development is scaling and every company that'd had to do it soon discovers it's not a quick process you can just throw resources at and expect results. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:47:40

@_date: 2017-06-15 16:06:32
Yeah but people prefer conspiracy theories rather than understanding how hard it is to run a web service that suddenly needs to scale 600% in a month.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:10:45
Indeed, my post was meant as very simple example rather than an exact trade.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:08:37
Yet lacks any actual evidence.
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:22:54
Servers die, software crashes, networks get overloaded, databases corrupt. Now try being one of the most well known exchanges with a massive influx of new users, your software that previously worked with 1000 customers at a time doesn't work with 10000 customers at time, bugs expose themselves at load, when services are distributed things can get weird. You can't just throw more servers (or developers) at the problem and solve the issues.
TL;DR [Computers are hard](

Wouldn't the optimal plan be to sell everything as soon after the split as possible then rebuy the winner? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:03:23
If that were th case gdax would be down as well, gdax is working absolutely fine. It's a scaling issue, more people equals more load equals things go down. I'm not defending them as it is a complete failure but and has been going on for ages but conspiracies help noone.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:44:01
This has nothing to do with hardware, this is a software issue. Software that runs perfectly at 1000 users can fail at 10000.
Throwing more hardware at the issue is pointless if it's your database can't keep up, or if your bugs only appear in your code when response times get over 50ms, or if there is time drift of more than 89.67ms between the queuing system and the message consumer.

Can you provide a link to that process? Everything I can find is saying you need a backup (encrypted by passphrase) for any recovery process. I could of course be missing something.
