Thanks for the help.  Is a fee involved with going back and forth between GDAX and Wallet? That's the only thing that gets me.  I know that I can go from Coinbase to/from GDAX for free, but people recommend keeping my BTC in a wallet.  If I put it in a wallet, however, I would have to transfer back and forth from my Wallet to GDAX, which I assume would have a fee each time?
Thanks again.

Definitely trying to convince you to sign up for their crappy savings account so that he gets a commission. 
I would inform him that you appreciate his advice on what investments are risky or not, and that how you choose to store your money is not anything that he controls, and he is simply just another method of storing your money that you no longer choose to utilize.
I'd tell him to provide the service that you are requesting, and to quit trying to tell you how to use the money that you have simply stored at his financial institution, or that you will find an institution that will, and remove ALL services from his institution..

@_date: 2017-12-06 16:13:21
Yep. That makes sense.
So for example,  I purchased BTC on Monday at roughly $11,400 on Cex.io, which is the Exhcange that has been higher by quite a bit all week.  (It was lower than $11,400 on the other Exchanges)
When I finally had my Coinbase account verified/accessible last night, I made a purchase on Coinbase last night.  I checked Cex.io, and it would have cost me quite a bit more in fees if I had made the purchase through Cex.io.
Is that what you mean?

Yes. But when Coinbase "tries" the first time, and there is not enough of an available balance, your bank will charge you an overdraft fee as soon as it gets a request for money from Coinbase and you do not have it.
Source: I accidentally did this when paying a Credit Card bill.  Didn't have the funds in the account, got slapped with an overdraft fee.  Didn't have funds in the account the next day, got slapped with a 2nd overdraft fee. Had funds available on the third day, and the Credit Card took their money.

I think that is what I was missing.  It just seems like Cex.io has been way higher all week.  (Side Note: When news headlines started popping up, I logged into an old account I left $6 in back in Mid-2016, and saw that it had greatly gained, so I've only really been back into it and investing this past week, so I'm only going off Cex.io being much higher than the others throughout the past week)

Companies will normally try on Day 1.  If it doesn't go through, your bank will notify them and charge you an overdraft fee.  The company will then try again on Day 2. If it doesn't go through, same thing. If it does, great.  So on and so forth.

i considered doing something similar. Glad to see I'm not alone.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:10:34
So in the example of Coinbase and/or Cex.io to Blockchain Wallet, would there be a fee? Maybe I am just not looking hard enough to find it.  In that scenario, would there be a fee to move it from Blockchain Wallet to Coinbase for when I want to use GDAX Trading?
That was my concern as well, as I figured there's always some sort of fee going between exchanges and wallets.
Thanks in advance.

I understand that, and given that concept no matter where i store it at the moment I still have the same XX Bitcoin...but it just seems like I would be goofing up somewhere moving it from CEX.IO at $13k and moving it to Blockchain Wallet at $12.5k.
Like it almost makes me feel like I should move my Blockchain BTC to CEX.IO since the BTC stored in Blockchain is valued at almost an additional 1K in value compared to Blockchain.
I understand what you're getting at, in regards to "if you have XX BTC, you have XX BTC, no matter where its stored", but I still feel like I am missing something...
