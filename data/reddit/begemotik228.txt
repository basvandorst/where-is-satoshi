Sick of seeing this joke everywhere. Zimbabwean dollar is not even in circulation since a few years ago. They use other currencies now, primarily the US dollar. Get your facts straight.

Strong hands don't invest everything they have
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:44:43


spot on, my shitty ISP changes my IP all the time and this happens, what's even the point when there's 2FA, but what bugs me the most is how you need to input 2FA twice when logging in from a new IP

He transferred the money, yes he was ripped off, but not censored. Idk what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-06-22 11:53:31


You could be demotivating people to transfer small amounts, but it's not censorship in any form.

Rock go down, but grug no sell, have strong hand

I think whoever didn't sell it this winter does feel stupid already. Hodl is a meme, not a strategy.
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:37:11
gas is paid in ETH, so yeah, OP didn't say anything wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-22 11:28:54
i don't get it, how is censorship related to fees?
p.s. somehow people didn't praise BTC for fees in December
@_date: 2018-06-02 13:14:10
But with CCs merchants cover the fees. And it's not like they give you a 3% discount for BTC payments either.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:46:24
Well I'd say you missed out a lot by not buying any other crypto...
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:53:23
So BTC infrastructure is developing rapidly. It can't be there from day 1.
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:23:06
Yeah, just like Bitcoin and Bcash
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:52:34
Nice to be non american lol
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:45:23
Because AML
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:00:45
I think that doesn't qualify as a "larger amount"
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:18:46
"as whale" lol

Clickbait BS title, they seized evidence not coins

what doesn't work with eos? giving your public key to someone?
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:12:44
no shit, if only you knew that address = public key
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:36:48
and some guy replied to it saying EOS is not decentralized? how is that even relevant lol. circle jerk much?
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:33:55
The above order has been null and void for decades
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:06:45
Setting aside the fact that taxes existed long before this order, how exactly will bitcoin make them null and void?
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:13:19
This was on here a while ago, you didn't fix it you just reposted an old shitpost.
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:08:47
... until it will
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:19:32
Credit cards are actually good if you don't spend more than you can repay interest free. Which most people are not capable of doing.

It's more user friendly and promotes adoption by customers if the vendor bears the fee rather than the customer. This is one of the things that need to change in crypto - TX and infrastructure costs should be covered by those who run businesses, not passed on to the customers. It gets even worse in Ethereum. Micro payments for every step you take on chain. It doesn't matter if it's a few cents or not, it's a psychological barrier and it's user hostile. Imagine a social network that would charge you to sign up, charge you to post and charge you to like a post. Obviously makes more sense if the infrastructure costs are covered by the vendor.

Really a quote from the federal reserve? I call BS
