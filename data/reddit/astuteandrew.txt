My botnet was requested for the attacks, I am supporting it.

walmart can no longer scam with chip based tech.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:54:57
it seems you can't either.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:37:50
no, packet manipulation.

More than half of the worlds populations does not even have a phone or have even seen one.

More than half of the worlds populations does not even have a phone or have even seen one; it seems you have not done yours.
Either way, the exploit works on only WINDOWS operating systems...I may have already said to much ;)
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:53:43
never said cracking anything.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:57:44
Well thats the debate I am having with myself, but honestly, I rather keep it to a minimum as I could get arrested for this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:01:48
DO IT
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:29:42
Just an update. The exploit is real, just it won't be released tomorrow; I was to lazy today to code it to an executable for the Windows operating systems as I was playing TF2 all day. Shame on all of you for thinking this is bullshit, you will all be the last ones laughing.
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:01:38
Sure it does not. They are feeding less than .1% of the worlds population; therefore, it feeds mouths, but a select few.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:44:37
GO TO /G/ AND OPEN YER EYES.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:59:17
18 percent of the world population owns a computer...let that sink in.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:59:50
dollars. Bitcoins are exploitable (as you will soon see).
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:57:55
you will soon see ;)
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:35:16
Once I release my exploit, 100% you will get over it ;)
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:08:48
made me loose it at dyson spheres. :P
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:55:58
why will I tell you when you will be able to use this exploit on any windows operating systems in days time. Sadly, the price will crash, but I will be forever known as the guy who fucked up bitcoin. Will be releasing on the major bitcoin forums sooner, rather than later.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:42:24
I wonder who is doing these attacks :D
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:54:36
only 18 percent of our population have a computer. EMERGHERD, BITCOIN IS GOING TO TAKE OVER.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:53:09
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:02:59
why would I do anything intelligent on reddit on this account? Plus this is reddit, the cancer of the internet.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:33:48
Nah, don't go too soon. Ride the wave for now, till I release my exploit.
I been making a steady 10k every day exploiting it. Until I reach my 1 million USD, then the exploit is released.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:36:27
I sold at 1k.
I am more than happy with what I got out of my investments due to my exploit (in which I keep doing err day)
just warning you, all bitcoin will be is a pump and dump scheme. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:53:18
sure. only takes 1 to fuck up everything.
