They would get complete ownership/control of the currency, unlike Bitcoin. 
The benefits are clear: reduction of transaction volumes, increase in trust and transparency, better handling of foreign debt payment, masked account details, among many others.

One of those.. It is very frustrating

First off, thanks for your help!
That is closer to what I wanted to ask.. However, could a company have something like a one-time multisig, where they validate the employee's parent public key? The idea is then that all the children public key created from that parent public key will be already validated and the employee can make transactions freely in a distributed ledger without the need of company's approval

Would it be possible to limit that a public key and its children cannot receive funds until the master public key (and master chaincode) is signed by an authorized person or department?  The network would have to prohibit unsigned public keys from receiving funds.

What would the downsides of the premined government cryptocurrency?

I'm talking about a theoretical possibility (perhaps an alt coin) where a distributed authority can validate a public key for use. If this authority does not sign the public key, then it would not be able to receive funds. 
Potential applications could be a coin for a particular company that wants their employees to pay for everything within the company with this coin, and wants to have control of who can or cannot have a public key.

Besides the obvious ideological downside (centralization), what are some technical and functional problems that a country might have if they wanted to implement bitcoins, or even they're own cryptocurrency, as the national currency?

Thanks! I'll check out Aurora
What do you think about the potential for a 3rd world country with very little regulations (as opposed to a strict country such as Iceland) where mobile influence is greater than that of computers, to premine a proprietary cryptocurrency and peg it to their existing currency?
