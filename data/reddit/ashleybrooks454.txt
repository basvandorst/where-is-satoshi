So true! I can see them saying 'trick or bitcoin' hahaha
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:21:14
Could you please provide a source?

I think the best way to celebrate it would be to actually spend Bitcoin at some merchant today or send some to a nocoiner friend.

Chill out guys. I think looking at month by month performance is as important as looking at longer period performance.

I get your point. But considering how volatile crypto market is, S&amp;P 500 performance last month would be equivalent to -50% in a crypto market 
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:18:50
Last time I checked it was 19%

yeah I just saw it, but I think it is still pretty well explained

It is not surprising to me. I tried creating an Apple app which was related to crypto once. It was super frustrating...

I totally agree that LN is still a baby, but regardless the movements of price developers are still working and the technology is improving. 
Bitfinex's team definitely does some sketchy operations, but I do not think that they are the main reason.
