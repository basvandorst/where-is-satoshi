Is PayCoin not a scam? So after Bitcoin there is PayCoin the most used digital currency in germany? Wow, I'm sorry dear germans.

There are still people using Coinbase, Circle, Bitfinex ...
People never learn. Never. And we should just ignore these posts, nobody cares about you guys - we told you 100000x

For a non IT guy, I dont think this will work as smooth like with bitpay or stripe.

As a noob: is this somehow also possible for bitcoin? I thought Ether had a more complex security and they still got hacked?

Could you please provide the source code?

Thanks! I hink for non it people duosearch is easier to use. I hope they will make it for the majority easier to handle openbazaar - because a non it guy wont download and configure stuff.

What is the URL of these stores? I cannot find them on 
Or are these "stores" only over TOR available?
@_date: 2016-09-02 10:41:01


I thought OpenBazaar was for the common mainstream guy, because for the Pro IT guys Linux and the Dark Net Markets were made?
Now I'm kind of confused.
@_date: 2016-09-04 08:29:26


But are they gonna try to make it later as easy as ebay or amazon for causal non it users?
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:18:06
And it is just 100x slower than TOR. And TOR is sometimes really slow, now imagine how great I2P is :)
Not talking about the bugs...

Dr Ruja Ignatova? Dr in what? In being a gypsy?
Fcking romanian gypsy, there are so many of them in europe - everybody hates them. How the hell are europeans still accepting this virus?
