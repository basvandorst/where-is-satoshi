Only with other lightning wallets. You will need to get an invoice or payment request details to pay, which is usually communicated by a QR code or a long hex string provided by the payee.

Not really. It's a legitimate choice to push forward BIP173 address usage, which uses less space on the blockchain as there is no P2SH wrapper required. Exchanges will only implement support for BIP173 address withdrawal if there is user demand. 
Electrum has followed this approach as well.

Depends on how you define 'full Segwit'. BitcoinJ has decided to skip BIP49 (P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH) and go straight to native Segwit wrt wallets.

It's actually not easy to brute-force the optional password. Since every possible password creates a valid wallet, you then need to descend to a node which contains a possible address and then look into the blockchain to see if it has been used already, which adds much to the computation.

It is not the 2MB block size itself, it is the hard fork needed to make this consensus level change. Segwit with softfork as proposed is guaranteed to disable covert asicboost. Segwit with hardfork is not guaranteed to do the same.

Segwit plus 2MB means a hard fork rather than a soft fork, which not only carries more risk, but means that covert asicboost could (potentially) remain possible, blocking all kinds of other protocol improvements.
