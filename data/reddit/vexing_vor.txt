OP didn't lose 20BTC.
OP realized he could place a bet without balance deduction while the hand is being played. The UI says he wins, but the bet doesn't actually go through because it's made during an invalid state. But the UI also says his wager wasn't taken from his account. He was betting on phantom money that he knew he didn't have to pony up.
OP gets 1BTC payout for finding this bug, but then makes 4 posts on to try and get the 20BTC the UI said he won despite wagering 0BTC. As the video shows, OP knows immediately that the wager is not deducted from his account. So why would he expect a win to be added to his account?
I had to read four fucking posts and watch a video to follow this scenario so it's possible I got it wrong.

So once you make 1000 bets at any amount, you can enter Lucky Mode where the house edge goes from 1.00% to 0.10%?

If I understand you correctly, I'm suggesting that your second sentence is a nonissue.
Employees are almost never in a position to "exploit" their employer. The employer just says "lolno".
Meanwhile, it's rare that an employer goes "hey Jim, I really think you need a break".

You have no experience with the things you speak of.
- There's a good feedback system on these darkmarkets
- You can get your drugs tested: 
- Much easier to find purer drugs on darkmarkets. Seriously?

Not when you're feeding it money through a business, especially anything "shady" (PayPal has a very broad definition of shady).
But for international traveling, I have to say PayPal is a pretty good option despite its shortcomings. You can treat it like a bank once you get its debit card. I haven't been in my home country for years now and I factored my local banks out of the equation long ago. I'd rather deal with PayPal for banal money-management things.
Wouldn't treat it as my business wallet, though!

No. Bitcoin, like World of Warcraft gold, isn't inherently illegal. But Bitcoin and World of Warcraft gold can be used to do illegal things once people agree that it has value.
Legal trouble sucks because it's the state that's after you. But revealing Satoshi puts him at a risk that's no better since he may still have access to a massive amount of Bitcoin.

When people say they researched something, they mean that they clicked a few links on the first page of google results when they searched for it.

An actual scene:
"While surfing the blockchain, forensics found some sort of secret message the hackers call a 'hash'."

Then there's Honduras, who's also doing interesting things with Bitcoin.

- Love [Coinkite]( for general Bitcoin API things.
- Love [Moneypot]( for Bitcoin gambling API tings. 
Love people focusing on APIs because they make our jobs as developers easier.

Unfortunately, it doesn't mean much at all and I'd argue that "unlimited time off" is toxic.
It's not unlimited. If nobody is taking time off, then you're not going to take time off. If you *feel* like you're behind in work, then you're not going to take time off. If you don't see people taking time off, then you're not going to take time off. If there's no actual culture for utilizing that "unlimited time off", then you're not going to take time off.
By the time the company wisens up and forces employees to actually utilize the vacation, they might as well just have required and finite vacation.
"Unlimited time off" sounded amazing until I had experience in companies with it. You look around and just see a lot of people that need to take time off but they won't due to even the perception of guilt or peer pressure. And by the time you need a vacation the most, your performance has started to falter and you're the *least* likely to take time off.


But I've given you 40 hours of work in your 40 hour work week. Just "get it done"?

My friends have all at least heard of it. They can google it if they give a real damn or I'll explain it in a 15-second nutshell if it comes up.
But any sort of unsolicited IRL evangelizing of bitcoin makes me cringe.

OP makes bets that clearly aren't deducted from his account because they're made during the hand. Then he expects any winnings on those bets to be added to his account.
How is anybody getting fucked here except the casino?
OP would have a case if he thought he was making these bets in earnest, but the bets are clearly not going through. If his video instead showed him losing on a wager that wasn't deducted from his balance, would be volunteer the money? lolno.
Sounds like OP is crusading for some hush-money to me.

Sure, but that's also just a cop-out that absolves Circle of being the dog shit that it is.
Don't store coins online, and avoid Circle.

bitcoind could make it simpler to set custom fees per transaction. At the moment it rounds to the nearest kb which makes granular fee control more annoying that it has to be for a service that wants a user to be able to insert a custom fee.
Ran into this on my own service.
