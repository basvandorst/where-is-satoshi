Just saying, this is an old post, from November, just reposted again, except this time the mining hashrate didn’t go over to 2.00x for bch, you can’t really blame this dip on bcash even though I hate roger Ver and jihan wu. Definitely they tried to attack again at an opportune time but this wasn’t their first attempt and it won’t be their last. Their first attempt they were able to manipulate the market and reach    0.5btc=1bch in value, at least this time they didn’t succeed very much.

Relax my mans, the guy wants reassurance at a time like this. Who would ever want to lose money, even hodlers are panicking although they bought in years ago or even months ago... it’s the volatility that is making people afraid. These large swings are unattractive to the untrained eye and that’s when the fear kicks in. Completely rationale, this isn’t the &lt; $1,000 bracket anymore, when swings are so wide it can cost  $100’s-$1000+ gain/loss at any given moment. Word of advice to OP, you’re in for a ride, you can sell if you have weak hands and a short term investment strategy and  set stop loss at 14k if u want out. Someone will buy it and the price will surge up again. This is a correction period. Same shit happened when Bcash was rallying and people who bought in at 7k saw their money drop to 5k and panicked as they thought this was the end for bitcoin. Coinbase is receiving an influx of so many new users, many of which jumped on board and have no clue. So weight out your risks and investment goal and decide from there.

Are you a trader or a hodler?
What are you looking for in bitcoin? Because if you’re not using gdax or any other exchange to trade your coins then you’re sitting with an account that can either be safe or get “hacked” and essentially you’d lose what you have.

Were you not here in November when jihan and his miners tried to orchestrate a heist? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:46:43
Well December 10 &amp; 18 are the days when two bitcoin futures tradings go live. Many expect bitcoin to be shorted so the money funneling in COULD be from institutions investing just to short it and unload their bitcoins before the contract... is this the end? Probably not. Will it scare regular investors like you and I, most definitely. This has escalated to the big leagues and the krill are about to get eaten by the whales. Who knows how many people will still hold when herd mentality is a world wide phenomenon and can affect anyone. We’ll see what happens tho. Tread lightly and read up on futures trading. Both sides of the story bring up brilliant cases and you cannot simply ignore one because you are biased to the other one. But like many I wish I simply could tell what is going to happen
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:46:23

Well, I’m not trying to defend them, they did have some shady employees investing early into bcash, but given that no one really expected this much growth in bitcoin (since we aren’t psychics), Coinbase is understaffed and lacks the infrastructure to support all their clients.

Bouncing back and forth between this sub and r/btc it’s evident that people are lured in by the pump... it’s shocking how blindly people will jump ships when it’s the community as a whole that controls the market.
