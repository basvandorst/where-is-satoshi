and follow/add to the discussion with a free github account.  You don't need to know code to have an opinion.  Just ask the internet.
All snark aside, even if you don't know the code, start a github account and follow the bitcoin repo.  At first you can just follow the conversation but as you get a handle, there is always documentation to be done and arguments to participate in that require no knowledge of c++ (the language bitcoin is written in)

I am starting out with the idea that the engine that moves me and the batteries that power the house part are separate.   I will start by making the 'house' part all renewable and then look to an EV conversion and hopefully a renewable charging station at my home base.  
The camper I am currently looking at is only $600 as I don't want anything big or nice so that I can do my own work on it.
National parks charge fees, National forests only charge for the pads, you can camp anywhere else for free.  Plus I have friends all over the country and plan to have a home base in Nebraska.  Either a cheap bit of land or rented driveway space from a friend.

My thought on the matter has always been if you are taking control of the source code by forking the core repository, then you are an altcoin.  If you want to make Bitcoin better, learn to code, test, write documentation and contribute.  Once you have displayed your competency, then you deserve to have a bigger say in the finer points.  just my 2 bits

@_date: 2015-10-16 05:42:07
If you want to help keep the network decentralized, just plug it in and forget about it and you will be providing a node for the network. If you are interested in developing, you have your own node. Going forward we hope to build a community of development to bring a Web based suite of apps like a wallet, point of sales, etc.   It's Linux, bitcoin, and node js so it's easy to get into.

1 Yes all software used is or will be by time of launch.
2 Size and simplicity. I wanted a 'black box' that I could just plug in and be a full node, not to make money off of but to simply participate.  We will probably include a touchscreen in v2.
3 I personally don't know what is so special about the 21inc box, I haven't really done my research yet.  However we also hope to bring down our price point as sales increase and technology improves.
4 I would hope that if our customers had any problems, they would contact us and let us help them fix it.  Anyone can flash a new SD card with a little help
