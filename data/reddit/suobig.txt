There's a lot of confusion going on because people are using currency terms while speaking about an asset (and at least for now Bitcoin is just an asset).
Assets can't be deflationary, only currencies can. If we're speaking about assets, we should use terms like "demand" and "supply". So your "deflationary" asset just means that it has limited supply. Assets with limited supply are not "designed to generate money". Stocks and bonds have limited supply, but they don't always generate money.

Unless you're in debt our you operate a business. In those cases it's designed to lose you money. That's one reason why we don't have deflationary currencies.

Can you please decide: BTC is a currency or a commodity?

Sorry, but I'm not buying it. There should be a pretty good reason for  a bank to prevent you from transferring your money from one account to another (for example, if they suspect that you're doing something illegal like buying drugs or financing terrorism). And "We want nothing to do with that bitcoin thing" is not good enough. I mean, why would they even care? They care about illegal activities only because the regulator forces them to. Otherwise they wouldn't either.

How is it even possible? So you have money on your bank account and you ask your bank "please transfer my money to another account" and your bank says **"NOPE"**?

We're on the verge of the biggest economical crisis in history. And no, bitcoins won't save you, sorry.

What western empire collapsed in 800 BC? I guess you don't understand what "BC" means.

It costs me 0 to transfer my money from an account in a bank to another account in the same bank.
It costs me if I want to cash out. And we'll see how much it'll cost this whale to cash out his $250M

I don't think it's even been alive as a currency. It's a funny asset that either allow people to gamble on the price or escape government's restrictions on buying or selling USD. But that's it. It's either a shady asset or a shady cheat the system mechanism.
When I see retail shops labeled "we're a accepting bitcoin!!!" I assume they partnered with someone that takes those bitcoins and gives the shop USD (or EUR, or whatever currency they operate on) so they escape all that legal and accounting difficulties. I mean, how do you put bitcoin on your company's account? Is there a currency code for it in their accounting system?  How do you determine an exchange rate?
