I think to many people are focusing on the 
"electronic cash system" and are forgetting "peer-to-peer."

What a joke

I promise you that the shilling would have taken care of itself. 
The only reason it's not the most widely used CJ platform is because it's the hardest one to install.
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:35:02
This is a useless metric. Stop it.

The only reason i dont run a full node is because my vpn wont allow it. I refuse to broadcast my ip to the world. Soon as i find a VPN that lets me run the node, Ill be participating right away.

It's an analogy. Only you think that it's literally gold. Here is a great video explaining why Bitcoin is better than gold. [

What [forkdrop.io]( shows is that there is very little value in trying to copy bitcoin unless you're ready to spend a bunch of money propping up the price. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:56:12
Litecoin did not fork bitcoin's UTXO set nor is it on [forkdrop.io]( 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:16:26
Is this a surprise to you? The subsidy is going away. Price appreciation is a must or this becomes a dead project.

Anyone is able to setup a instance. It's like saying you're the founder of your bitcoin node.  I'm not on bitcoinhackers. The founder of Mastodon is Eugen. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:16:20
Bitcoin is working exactly like designed. I'm not sure what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:04:39
I'm not sure if you noticed but litecoin is making 5 year lows against bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:48:38
The founder is  [**Eugen**  . This article is just a joke.

If people are willing to pay high fights why is the network in need of saving? 
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:03:00
*high fees ...sorry ..autocorrect. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:43:02
It had more then lag issues. I ended up having 800 coins in my account when i only really was supposed to have like 7. Then it went down too 96. Now i have 0.1 coins with -$1600 balance. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 15:29:36
Spot on good sir. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:33:44
"Bitcoin fees can, at peak times, exceed credit-card fees, for example." Is that for real or flat out lie? 
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:39:00
Nope, it's an alt coin. If you and anyone else think it's superior than by all means the market will decide. Make no mistake. It's an alt coin. On another note..we get it, you don't like the censorship. My question is, why are you still here? You're all about AnCap, right? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:52:13
Only suggestion i'd add is when one helps set up family/friend's wallets, you should at the very least explain to them the benefits of running a full node. If they don't see it's worth their time, setup their light wallet so it connects to your node only. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:35:50
Yes, you are right. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:20:21
Ahh thank you :) !!
@_date: 2017-01-29 20:15:11
Awesome :) 
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:47:03
Yep, after watching that video is when i started to question Gavin's motivies. He truly believed centralizing nodes was perfectly fine. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:59:37
It's my feeling that Charlie is just making stuff up. He was in the room when the NYA was being discussed. He knows exactly who was there and who wasn't 
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:31:04
I asked him to bring someone else on. Maybe it was to fast of a notice? 
@_date: 2016-11-05 13:15:26
Why do you think that the "few major actors" haven't forked off yet? This "debate" has been going on for over two years now. 
@_date: 2016-11-05 21:20:15
1)No one is stopping you from HFing bitcoin. 2)The market thinks otherwise. 3)Wasn't bitcoin supposed to be broken by now? 
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:11:57
The diff goes down and I can start up my ASICS again for winter time. :). That's the short answer.  
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:47:38
I don't think shopping is the ultimate goal of bitcoin. Stopping WAR would be the ultimate goal. Governments around the word would have to listen to the people for the first time in history. This is a very powerful thing. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:14:33
Voting. Ha. Right. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 12:44:47
Politicians are also polite most of the time. Government agents always come off as the nice guys. The more Gavin speaks the more I'm convinced he's works for the state. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 11:58:04
"The whole purpose of Bitcoin is money without a trusted party or dependency or service provider." I hope you're a core supporter. If you believe this statement then you should be running a node.
@_date: 2016-09-04 13:37:28
Yes, Wake me up when we hit $10k

Any plans on giving 'in wallet advice' on what UTXOs shouldn't be paired together in a mix?

Great discussion! Bitcoin will make you go crazy Chris. Just go with it. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:02:13
Please don't forget to to give a review for ALL light wallets on the playstore/app store. Make sure people realise that if they don't use the trusted node feature, they're is a good chance that they won't be receiving bitcoin when they think they are. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:07:15
Can we take this happen? Roger is ready to do this trade. I was going to trust Ben Davenport as escrow but this sounds much safer.

How about you come on the mumble and we talk about it? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:05:55
No, i'm convinced they'll get extblocks via SF and there is nothing you or I can do about it.

This is getting old. Just fork off already for crying out loud.

Where can I find the information on what spv wallet let's you connect to your own node?

try dragonsden.io 
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:33:05
We can record it and link it to youtube. I'd prefer that everyone listens to our conversation. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:30:52
Greg, i have much respect for you but many of us feel that the reckless move here is playing the waiting game with Jihan and company.
