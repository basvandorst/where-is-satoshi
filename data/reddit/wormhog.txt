Your first step should be to get it added to this standard.... 
and get inclusion here:
You'd have nothing more to prove to Unicode.

No, just that someone had already claimed it or been identified. Wasn't me.

Of course the Libertarians support bitcoin. You'd think it would be part of the platform.

Why not get the library policy changed? It was obviously unusual and wrong. I was way ahead of my reading age too and was never limited in what I could read. Teachers gave me things to read. My brother was seriously bullied, as smart kids frequently are and no doubt he has scars. I also know that teaching is a profession one studies for. Not saying there aren't parents capable of teaching their own kids, but doesn't the somewhat anti-establishment attitude and lack of exposure to diversity make you worry you may be taking your kids off the college path? Do you want them to get an advanced degree (realizing that's really up to the kid)?

They already did, it seems.

Well, that was fun, internet stranger. And no, I did not have a wallet before today. I had another wallet with a different service, but never really used it. Otherwise a total newbie. Thanks!

Does this automatically give someone a Bitcoin account, and/or do you have magic powers?

If you use the state curriculum, I support your choice much more. I do think bullying scars some for life. I guess I'm just not sure if that's part of what life teaches you.
Didn't know that about school supplies today or how prevalent that is. I just helped a first-grade buy art supplies through Reddit. Is it more fair to have the teacher pay for all your theoretical kid's supplies than the communism approach? Because that's what happened for decades. No one defended the teachers. The money that paid for my mom's kids' school supplies came out of my college fund. i suppose you thought that was less commie. Keep in mind, you don't see your teachers and all the work they do once they get home or after class. I still believe the answer is to fight for improvements to the system, even the curriculum used to homeschool, rather than kinda taking your ball and immediately going home. My mother worked from 5 a.m. to usually 10 p.m. every day on education and working for political change in education. My schoolteacher mom was too busy so I was raised by my engineer dad mostly whose job ended with the workday. I think you've made a guess at how little teachers work without knowing the reality. Teachers created the homeschool plans you use.

What do you base that on? You do know that most teachers take their students' papers home with them to grade. My mother was up at 5 a.m. and fell asleep in front of the TV every night when she finally got to grading papers after feeding her family. There's no supply catalog for teachers -- so they shop for supplies with their own money dragging their own children along on the weekends. I had some asshole teachers, but I don't know many I would describe as lazy compared to Joe Office Job who spends his day gleefully shitting on company time, Redditing, and taking 2-hour lunches.

OK. I disagree with you on 1 mildly. There are definitely people who can't prepare a kid to enter college. Teachers are taught about how the kid's brain develops and are taught ways to stimulate the brain. They are then trained on the job extensively. Now I give you points for correctly determining your daughter wasn't getting what she needed. My award-winning schoolteacher mother likely wouldn't have let me stay in that school either, but I'm guessing her first approach would be to try to talk to the principal about the library policy. That's how you fix what's broken. Point 2 -- while I'm not sure college is broken today, I kinda agree with you about knowledge being free and education needing to evolve. Point 3, I believe, is unlikely to happen because you've already taught your kids that formal education is a bad thing. Doesn't mean they won't learn, grow and be happy but, I fear you're pushing that option off the table for them and will be harder on them if they do decide to transition to a more formal environment. Point 4, I'll have to take your word for -- how do you ensure this when homeschooling? Do you have a class of homeschooled kids? I'm not trying to be hostile. I have a friend who is homeschooling his kids in Alaska and has obviously given it a ton of thought. I assume you have too. But what do you do with idiot parents who want to homeschool their kids but don't know they're not smart enough?
