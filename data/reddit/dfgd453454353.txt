Gox also converts money internally.. gox will buy gox dollars and convert them to eur to pay out a btceur sale.

how would you distribute the votes? I don't really think decentralized voting is possible.. and if it isn't then you might as well just use a centralized vote tabulation system too.. you could always publish all the votes afterwards so anyone who wants can add up the votes and see there's no cheating by that mechanism (of course cheating is still possible in the initial distribution of votes - but there's no way to solve that one anyway).

If you send an EUR payment from a UK bank it will go via SEPA.
Your bank will charge something for making the SEPA transfer and you'll get their fx rate for GBP to EUR which usually means you lose around 3% of the value in conversion.
I'm not sure where you got the $15 USD fee from.. is that a bitstamp fee? My bank charges £5 per SEPA transfer.. others vary. afaik none are free :/

No. How would they get the vote in the first place? And how do you know whoever gives out the votes doesn't allocate a bunch of them to sockpuppets?

They don't let you do it, however they do arbitrage themselves in order to prevent the BTC markets getting too far apart.

right - and they probably already do.. but if you're going to rely on a centralized database to begin with there's no benefit of using a decentralized voting system.. just publish everyone's votes afterwards - maybe using a hash of the social security number so people could check their own vote is registered but not steal everyones ssid. that's about as good as you can get and it might make some kinds of cheating detectable, but not ones involving initial manipulation of the vote issuing.

You can still cash out in other currencies though.. so mtgoxUSD isn't worthless - it's just worth 3% less (or whatever the cost of getting some other currency out and switching it back to USD).

EUR/GBP are easily interchangable with USD.. it just adds a little friction on getting from mtgoxUSD to USD.
