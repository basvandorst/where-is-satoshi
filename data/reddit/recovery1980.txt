"eth heads" -&gt; attempt at shaming.  
Selling to people who had to earn that money is not a "pre-mine". First ICO, so what?   
Supply had a known upper limit growth rate since the sale and has been strictly going down, to the point where there might well be negative inflation as fees get burned.   
"poop coin" -&gt; more schoolyard psychology.   
The DAO hardfork was backed by more than 85% of the network by every metric that could be used, from developers to coin holders to miners to individual forum users. It was a serious mission to get it to that level and there was no "small group of people". Bitcoin forked too and around 85% of the people supported one of the chains. There were also two early hard forks for Bitcoin, Bitcoin has ossified and so will Ethereum.   
 "Vitalik literally asking exchanges to stop trading" -&gt; this is true, guess you can't be all wrong.  
" all of which were set to lose significant money, is a lie. " -&gt; NOSENSE, of all the foundation members at the time the only one with significant DAO ownership was Gavin Wood.

That is what happened during the previous rally. BTC rallied first and then as the herd came, the alts started bubbling up. The height of this irrationality was when the  correlation between if a coin would rally or not, was unit price, not even martket cap.   
I think it's going to repeat at some point as BTC funds bleed into the other funds. BTC dominance will likely return after that.

Count the nodes that are visible for both networks. 
Archive nodes in Ethereum are nodes which, in addiction to storing all transaction on all blocks, also store the state as it was calculated between all transactions. This is useful for debugging purposes and for getting data into block explorers.

That which can be represented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. However since I have evidence let me present it.  
Ethereum's clients have become extremely efficient over time, under huge pressure from having to process a lot of tasks in various forms. Ethereum has 80% of the full Nodes that Bitcoin has (and yes they are full nodes, archives nodes are something else). Ethereum also has more mining diversity and more implementation diversity than Bitcoin.

I've been around since 2011. Back then I had 3 criteria that determined if I acquire more Bitcoins.
1. Do I have money?
2. Is Bitcoin worth $100,000 or more.
3. Is there something demonstrably better. 
I came here from the goldbug/libertarian communities. It was saddening to see how many of them just didn't get bitcoin. But what was sadder were there ad hominem tirades as to why Gold didn't strike $50,000 as promised. All the while they missed a real revolution which they didn't understand. 
Reading posts like this remind me of those goldbugs, many of who still argue that a gold backed digital currency is superior to Bitcoin. The things Oleg says about Voldacoin (the coin that may not be named) is simply false. Voldacoin has a clear path to PoS as a scaling solution, Voldacoin has an **on chain** scaling plan that pushes it well beyond RootStock's 300tps, Voldacoin is generic enough to implement mixing contracts to provide decent privacy and nothing prevents special case TXs from being implemented to facilitate Monero like mixing. 
It is totally possible that anything, regardless of it's network effects can be outmaneuvered if it doesn't scale **at the pace the market requires or it's closest competitor.**
Here as a warning is Shaun Parker talking about how Facebook shouldn't have won, but did anyway...

When you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras.
Which is simpler; that the people with the commit rights to the reference implementation is==are (rightly/wrongly) afraid to increase the block limit? And that this is causing the problems we now experience (to later benefit/loss)
**or** that sinister forces are conspiring to manipulate the price downwards so they can... buy more...?

This *clones* Ethereum, FTFY
@_date: 2016-11-07 05:20:56
Well actually if you want to secure anything in even the simplest contract it will have to live on Rootstock and be subject to it's attack surface.
The cheaper than ETH thing is extremely unlikely. Since most of the ridiculously unbounded costs of ETH are spent in storage and network syncs, if Rootstock offers EVEN MORE network traffic it matters little what consensus mechanism they use. 
That said, they will be cheaper for value transfer than BTC at first and given the high BTC costs, that alone will give them some adoption. 
Also don't forget the fees on Rootstock, 20% of all fees go to RSK Labs. You think you disliked the idea of the Bitcoin Foundation and the Efukium Foundation? 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:59:12
That answer is inaccurate, that isn't how oracles function. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 05:04:57
Once they switch to PoS, they plan on dropping the block reward to cause between 0% and 1% inflation (lower than BTC)
RSK Labs will take 20% of all the fees on Rootstock, this is far more than the EFoundation has in incomes. It will open up Rootstock to a fork without the fees as well as create enormous centralization pressure. **Again, 20% of all mining fees.** 
You might value different ideas, but Rootstock might not be the place to find them. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 13:44:25
Even if they decide to keep it as it is now, it will tend to 0% over time since the release rate remains constant. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 09:01:04
Oracles are entities that are incentivised to put data onto a blockchain. Similar to mining it would have a cost and would find a certain efficiency niche, this means that RSK Labs would specialize in blockchain consensus (or in this case porting EthereumJ) and would then attempt to subsidize that activity with a secondary activity. 
Their actual plan is to charge 20% of the mining fee on each transaction. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:21:35
