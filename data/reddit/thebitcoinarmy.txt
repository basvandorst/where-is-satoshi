same, i already stuck a bit back in no worries :O
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:16:17
Dont worry, when trading opens up it will be like hair implants from your pubes.
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:24:29
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:08:16
haha nailed it
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:09:59
maybe donate 1 btc to many people next time?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:32:56
Make BFXcoin tradable, you can make a market with fees, else a market will occur outside the platform
@_date: 2016-08-24 14:29:08
So everyone should opt in? what if i dont opt in?  sorry just saw this update.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:49:09
If only bitfinex read this earlier
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:12:14
if someone is that concerned they can leave asap
@_date: 2016-08-06 08:23:45
This is not correct for crypto is it? poloniex could not pay users and everyone took a haircut until it could pay.
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:32:48
passwords are always forced to change and 2FA updated, this isn't new to this event
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:11:14
forget about getting those dudes involved, its just headache and time (years).
@_date: 2016-08-12 07:36:36
that is the plan though 
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:49:03
Who knows.... Bitfinex is the best exchange with the best options to trade, there will be a market for shares in the best bitcoin exchange i should think. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:17:53
yeah but i sleep longer than 2 hours lol
@_date: 2016-08-22 15:52:03
can you tell us anything about the equity deals? when it might happen? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:04:36
You wont take 70% with some IOUs? you'd rather some pain in the arse legal route that takes years, fuck that.
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:09:38
yeah what day will trading return, should i stay up all night tonight or what? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:06:29
good fucking call
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:04:01
What are bitfinex going to personally contribute to this hack? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:08:11
some people trade more than others, 0% is almost worthlesss to me personally.  
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:45:58
already higher price
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:53:05

@_date: 2016-08-26 07:32:59
^ makes zero sense
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:40:52
you get 64% + there is 0.3 on the dollar of your lost 36% on the table for anyone who wants out now, the lawsuit route is pointless. Everyone can get back 3/4 now.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:08:24
You wont get any better, 100% wont happen in any route.  The tokens could turn out great and make profit, lets see.
@_date: 2016-08-14 07:35:02
Bitcoin maximalists are the opposite of Bitcoin minimalists.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:29:55
It would be smoother scam to just make customers whole though
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:34:38
i would think people are buying to make a profit, check here, 3-6 months you either have equity or money back:
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:00:21
Can they not have a fee share coin? this could make the price very high, we might all end up with profit.  Why stop at $1 ? 
Remember that MCXnow fee share coin went to moon.
@_date: 2016-08-09 04:37:28
If your coins were not stolen its because you had 5 BTC or under, the hacker left smaller wallets.
We need to make sure the token they issue is worth the most possible, i suggest you use your efforts on that.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:37:45
Oh yeah its a free market though
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:34:27
actually let me change that to this addy which is direct to non exchange wallet :): 
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:33:52
no its retarded, you got 64% back + another 0.4 on the dollar for the remaining 36% right now = 14.4%
So total you can get back today = 78.4%

had no idea it was on youtube, it was copied from   not the youtube channel, i did link that link in the description, i never copy a video if its already on youtube, the tip address is for the effort, 1 tip this year of 40k satoshi if you are worried.
i will take the video down since its on youtube, thanks
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:52:48
Zane said nothing has been decided about exactly how the token will work (listen to the whalepool Q&amp;A), people are asking for it to be tradable, for it to be tradable it needs to have more value than an IOU i guess. If its just an IOU i should imagine thats because they have investor lined up and dont want to give customers extra value out of the bitfinex business.  
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:28:23
someone tell pokerstars to accept BTC
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:31:33
finex say they will either be fully repaid or converted to share equity in 3 - 6 months:
@_date: 2016-04-24 13:10:01

ohh thats decent news

@_date: 2016-04-14 10:25:42
the point you make about that guys comments validate my thoughts
@_date: 2016-08-06 08:10:36
how ya know?
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:15:18
The argument is a good one, take the 64% + token and be happy, end of story.
I am not a CPA and i dont care what that means. i followed all the details, i tried to sniff any potential scam, i dont see any scam, i think 64% + token is a good outcome.

You have no choice now, already down from 20k a few days ago so the decision is already made for you.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:55:52
Also, something for Autism spectrum a good idea - Not sure on registered charity for that one, for higher end functioning autism the system seems useless so not sure how the registered charities will help there.  Also, many people seem to have what seem to be physical problems but its psychosomatic - this is a much misunderstood area in health/medicine - mainstream charities are no good due to pharmaceutical corruption. (i can explain further on that but hopefully you get the gist)

OP..... You cant be emotionally ready for happiness without basic standards of living in place, for basic standard of living you need money or make alternative choices.
How many of us actually have a basic standard of living? i'm not talking just eating and roof over your head btw. If you are to compete with others in the 1st world, by basic standard i mean:
- Decent diet
- Decent peaceful living conditions with space (very costly)
- Decent work life balance (very hard to get right)
- Decent education/information (luckily the internet has solved this for free practically)
- Any therapy for any previous issues depending on background. 
Either way if you aren't supported by anyone like you may have been as a kid (most of you aren't).... you need a few hundred K in $ equivalent or a decent paying job which doesnt take all your time &amp; doesnt stress you out.  This is what you need to just begin life in the current system imo.  
99% of people here i would guess are under funded under supported.  Welcome to the steaming shit pile which is modern 1st world society.  Dont expect high end happiness.  You'll likely have to make many alternative compromises to gain some happiness in life.
Crypto is just the start of the revolution. This current system is unworkable.

@_date: 2017-02-01 15:02:25
Well it would be a 10x move from here, that would be the smallest ever bubble yet.  But the problem is its $9k more right? making it a huge market cap also, it seems really hard to hit 10k i guess but bitcoin is messed up, in theory we should be taking over the world. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:00:09
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:00:00

10k is just over 10 times the price now, its not totally unrealistic we hit that much sooner.  $100k is more 10 years IMO.  Look at how it moves when it gets going, the west isn't even buying yet, the floor is like 800-900 before we even start

@_date: 2016-09-19 18:15:55
Yeah... so in UK inflation average rate = 2%.  As average joe you used to be able to beat inflation with bank interest.  Now if you hold fiat you are losing money each year.
@_date: 2016-09-19 09:09:50
You are currently invested in fiat so get rid of that fiat before its worthless.

@_date: 2018-03-19 09:55:06
What you going to do sell and try to rebuy 20,30,40% cheaper ? when we are already down massive amounts last few weeks? thats a risky strategy.
"Crypto is in a lot of trouble."   lol no its not, its in the best spot its ever been. You just thinking about price right now.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:08:27
Its become more stable over the 10 years since its birth, percentage terms matter more vs dollar terms do they not? Percentage growth is down each price bubble isn't it? 
And to your 2nd point, isn't bitcoin popular because people wanted more control over their money?  Any gov crypto coin could actually promote bitcoin or wipe it out? its all speculation?  Its harder speculating on government actions than it is the price? long term the price just goes up over time if bitcoin is left alone it seems ?  it would be strange for bitcoin to just randomly die off now based on current information?
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:53:58
You are the one who mentioned price first, look back at the conversation, i asked why you were here.
IMO Bitcoin is not ready to be used a stable global currency until it has much more adoption.  Its still pretty new and small user base vs the USD.  
The people speculating is just a sideshow.    
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:46:15

Thousands of bitcoiners still waiting on the 202k btc to be distributed is 1 reason.  The rest of the bitcoin missing is another reason.

Likely just yoga or meditation or healthy lifestyle

What PhiMinD said was pretty accurate.  
Royal family mean to do well, just like government do etc.  Neither are evil is just closed source systems are prone to less scrutiny.  
When it comes to earth's resources or political power lets just compete on an even playing field please members of society.  
@_date: 2015-11-01 02:56:33
what do u consider useful?
@_date: 2016-10-23 10:52:12
They lost some profit and time taken to clean up mess.  I know what you are saying.  Im trying to be nice to them, if the story checks out as true they lost several million (estimate of lost profit and time taken) - if you wanted a $ figure.
@_date: 2015-11-20 14:22:52
yep indeed
@_date: 2015-03-20 10:53:46
Its not the UK royal family's intention to hurt people either but you cant participate in that very easily.  We agree having the royal family ends up in a negative for society right? 
Bruce Fenton is awesome, i just either dont agree or dont understand.  Im not hearing anything which is changing my mind atm.  Sounds like small scale nepotism to me.

What about if someone creates a decentralized poker site like open bazaar is doing for shopping market.  That gives everyone incentive to play because of rake free poker, no player can turn that down, maybe fish dont care so much but hey its rake free, reg vs reg can work.  Donation based software team like open bazaar model.  Im aware rake free rooms have failed before due to no advertising, i used to play on the very first one called hmm world something? also a former pro myself.
Bitcoin is the only way to bank while doing this. How do you police any cheating? - fuck knows, perhaps only could work for heads up only? (still would be kinda cool just as that)
If open bazaar can bring in shoppers, a decentralized poker site can bring in players? 
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:23:37
Well you can marry into the royal family like kate middleton but its extremely hard to become royal it seems.  Almost zero social mobility.
So freemasonry is as harmless as becoming like an adult boyscout? A club with no real power etc.  So... no resources in the public sector are ever channeled toward 1 freemason by another freemason?  They never have a "get out of jail free card"?

edit: tweet from 1 of the original sources: 
FUD no content article, who was the representative coindesk spoke with? 
1.) Pokerstars are obviously thinking about bitcoin else pocketfives.com wouldnt have posted this in december: 
note: pocketfives are a solid poker news source with contacts within the poker community, they arent some pump and dump news source.
2.) Pokerstars are obviously playing it very safe from a legal angle, email them and ask them about bitcoin yourself.  They will neither confirm or deny but mention the word bitcoin.  When i emailed stars about bitcoin 1 year ago they were like.... we are always looking at new deposit options, thanks for the suggestion as if they'd never heard of bitcoin.  When i emailed them 2 days ago they clearly used the word bitcoin twice.  Translation, it is on the road map.
3.) Stars take forever to do anything they are like mtgox except stars always deliver amazing products in the end.
Conclusion: stars will be accepting bitcoin in under 1 year very likely.

The guy who wrote this says things like.... bitcoin is an economic non event, then says when a new business accepts bitcoins  its a just a marketing strategy - the 2 dont add up.
Many more contradictions/straw mans from him.  Think he just wanted to think of a topic and a point of view which might sell some books.
