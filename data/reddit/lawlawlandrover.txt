My wife bought hers on eBay, I'd sell there and buy btc on an exchange.  Try craigslist.
I'd imagine that the number of people willing to exchange a btc for a wedding dress in the US is in the single digits.

I think it's the other way around.  They changed their name for shits, people threw money at them, now they're thinking "Hey, this could actually be worth it..."

You've had your chance for ten years.  What's going to happen ten years from now?

State?  Try r/legaladvice.
You'll likely have to file a probate petition and get a judge's order that the btc is an asset of the estate and that coinbase must open the account to you.
good luck getting an inventory/appraisal on that.

Despite the negative press, Coinbase/GDAX is a US-based entity with insurance covfefe.  Gemini is another option.

Here's a great example of the technology using prison and mackerel, no joke:

Idiot, should have bought a rocket to get you to the moon.

So buy part of a Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:29:56
nooooooooo, nobody wants a crash!!!
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:07:33
I'll sell you it at 15 to prove them all wrong
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:39:41
Yeah, just as I got back from lunch and was going to sell.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:51:43
I feel like Coinbase "breaks" every time this stuff happens, as it prevents panic selling.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:23:26
deal, 10 @ $15k
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:51:22
LACES OUT

Nah, I'm just going to harvest karma by reposting the good 13k memes

if anyoen could predict that, they would be extremely rich, and then sell the knowledge to other people and make more money.

Buy high, sell low.  Sounds like a good idea
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:13:45
and everyone just panic sold...
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:56:37
now you get to recycle!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:39:50
It goes up or down, or sometimes neither.  Buy high, sell low.  Now is always the best time for both.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:14:15
but maybe later
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:14:35
Gold, duh
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:44:48
This isn't my first rodeo, I was just happy to sell at 13800 and wait for this to happen before buying back in.  But that long lunch just screwed me.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:40:41
well, now I will.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:22:01
Thank you.

huh? we're under 12 now
