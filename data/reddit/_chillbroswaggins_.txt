I don't understand why comments like this are not towards the top. All the top comments are, "Oh that poor man is going to be harassed now" or, "Why couldn't they leave XYZ detail out of the story?". What about the talk about Bitcoin?
There are glaring inconsistencies and mistakes throughout this horrid article. Here, I'll focus on just the talk about Bitcoin/protocol: (TL;DR: The reporting on Bitcoin alone is riddled with errors.)


* No, the wallet data/keys are stored, or printed on paper wallets, etc. The transactions, and thus actual funds in addresses, are recorded on the Blockchain, which is public.


* Again, No. People are the ones who are vulnerable, since they are now their own banks. You don't say 'The U.S Dollar is vulnerable to fraud and scandal', you say that a bank or business is vulnerable.


* I'm pretty sure that if the price dropped to $130 in February, I'd have a lot more Bitcoin. This is just hype. BTC-e didn't even dip that far, don't get me started on Gox. A quick search of  and not being on Mars in relation to the Gox scandal will disprove this quote.


* Correct me if I'm wrong but can we get the reference that **proves** these were attacks and not just regurgitated hearsay?


* This has been proven as mis-quoted/paraphrased already on this sub~~, I'll try to find a link.~~ [Link.](
To think that the author [Leah McGrath Goodman]( researched for a whole 'two-month investigation' is laughable. She didn't even fact-check the points in her own article covering Bitcoin itself. How did she expect to have a conversation with the creator about it?

The lady they interviewed started out with strong vocabulary, and finished with incredible ignorance.

Yes, I would contribute.
As for your other question, that is the beauty of making things open-source; There is no telling what cool things can and will get made.

Not to mention the [piss poor reporting]( surrounding Bitcoin itself!

I should have made it:
"First Bitcoin transaction: 8084 Satoshis!
I'm Rich!"

Blindly downvoting you say?

I concur.

The point is that a layman is more likely to generate their wallet with a bad passphrase, since they are lazy, don't follow instructions or whatever reason. If they don't even try brainwallets they are forced to just generate a random address.

Satoshi? O_O

HAHA I was too lazy to make this, have an orange arrow

Don't do this. Brainwallets are not secure. Just generate a random private key. Someone posted on the requirement for scraping private keys, it was something like [3 octodecillion]( years with generous variables. On the other hand people are successfully scraping for brainwallets today (and emptying them!)
