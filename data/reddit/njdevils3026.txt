Noob trying to get their BCH; sorry for clogging this thread with more of this. Just put all my BTC into an Airbitz wallet and extracted the private keys. What is my next step to getting my BCH? Do I just import the private keys to a BCH supporting wallet? Or is there something else that I'm missing?

It's definitely at least a little confusing lol, I'm with you. I feel like I followed the instructions correctly up to the last part. I got my private key pre-fork, exported my bitcoin to a separate wallet, and now I'm just trying to figure out where to put my private key from my old wallet to redeem my BCH. Hoping this gets answered in a blog post or something in the next 24 hours. I've been setting up accounts with multiple wallets supposedly supporting BCH so that if any of them start supporting BCH in-app, that I'll be able to just plug my private key in and finally redeem them. It's a waiting game. I don't have much BTC, so I won't be totally heart broken if I wind up not getting my BCH. Especially if it crashes and burns.

From what I was reading, it seems like some wallets might come out with updates to support BCH, but my guess is that only happens if it's successful. If you planned to hold, and not sell, then you should be fine in the long run as long as you have your private key. I wanted to dump my BCH for BTC but didn't understand it clearly enough to risk my BTC. Also Kraken doesn't work in my state, so I couldn't have even risked leaving it on the exchange to get auto credited the BCH. I'm sure more clear cut info will come out as the situation resolves itself.

Okay, that makes sense. I planned on holding both anyway so I might as well be patient and hope Airbitz comes out with an update that supports BCH.
Thank you for taking the time to answer my question amongst the mess of confusion on this sub today.
