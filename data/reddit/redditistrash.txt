Seems like they still wouldn't be profitable at this price given the difficulty increases.

About that...

Sideways I think for a while longer.

At the high point before it crashes to $1000.

This as a gambling game would be rad.

K, but do it with 5 custom characters at the start and end, and not a single letter repeated, use a word or something. 
Bet it doesn't finish in a few seconds.

There's barely any point to mining now if you don't have totally free electricity. The new 7nm miners don't fix the equations either, it's still mostly unprofitable, or going to bring in such a tiny profit you might as well go bank it and get 0.15% interest.

It hasn't been profitable for years without free electricity anyway. The miners simply aren't remotely powerful enough given the difficulty increase.
Buying e.g., any miner out there today is 100% unprofitable even with nearly free electricity.

Your comment is retarded.
