They said they had to call multiple times. They should only have had to call them once or not at all.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:56:18
Good for you. That sucks! Sorry to hear about that. It was insured so it ended up being ok right? Can’t steal my crypto unless I’m really dumb.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:01:26
Wells Fargo blocks blocks buying crypto. They have for a while now. Fuck the banks. Why should you have to ask permission to use your own money? I had a bank site go down for 3 days and it messed my life up big time. I’m in control of my own finances now.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:14:09
How much time did you spend on the phone with them? Wasting your time. I just withdrew all my money and told them to fuck off and a they would never get my business again. Same thing with my old credit union.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:59:37
I wouldn’t let us know either! Good luck I hope it’s a bunch.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:25:29
I feel the feels
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:04:32
No clue sorry.
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:26:45
You just have to look. I sell fresh veggies from my garden and greenhouse for crypto!
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:52:01
You can buy so many Eggo’s with 1 Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-09-18 19:38:25
Hahaha I love these guys! I used to help ship out their merch. Good to see them all over the internet and especially here in r/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:48:51
I’ll take em!
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:37:56
You buy it with fiat. Their fiat holds no value why would they keep it? 
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:56:23
I only use Avalons for BTC mining. They have a new unit coming out as well and the 9xx series. Canaan is amazing and much easier to run multiple ASICs due to how their controller works!
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:07:06
My friends family in Venezuela has a debit card tied to their crypto wallet. They walk across the border to Chile to buy food and gasoline with BTC. They save a lot time and money over a traditional money order.
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:34:48
We have massive solar, wind and nuclear power plants down here. It’s crazy how much wind energy we can produce!
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:17:58
You should sell them b4 new ones come out and people will still buy them.
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:58:06
Bitcoin reaper of bankers souls

I like it. It reminds me of Diablo 3.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:04:55
Then you did no research and bought in at ATH’s. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:50:43
I accept crypto for my veggies from my garden. It’s a cool way to help spread adoption!
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:10:19
I just wanted to say thanks! My friends and I have been using Slush Pool for years. Keep up the great work.
@_date: 2018-10-19 00:49:22
I found out about it on SomethingAwful forums back in 2009. I mined it through the wallet back in the day. I have a few S3+'s laying around after it went asic. I mostly cashed out in 2014 for a double hernia surgery and 9 months of not working. I'd be stupid rich if I held! Oh I also tried to give everyone in my family 1 BTC for Christmas in 2013 they were confused and upset by it lol
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:15:43
I use the heat from my ASICs to heat my home and greenhouse!
@_date: 2018-10-20 15:35:29
If I wasn't saving up for brain surgery and my daughter to go off to college I'd send you some lol
@_date: 2018-10-20 01:31:14
They refused the gift and got mad at me :/
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:44:32
I'm selling some to my coworkers for a small fee.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:09:48
For like $10 usd? Someone gave me some yen. More of a novelty than a business.
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:45:50
Do it if you can afford it.
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:39:22
Most homeless people are mentally ill and can’t get the help they need. I know I’ve been homeless.

You made 50 minus the 15% short term gains tax if you’re in the US. Don’t forget about that tax man!
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:48:28
My 10 year old took her change to the local coin star and got Bitcoin instead of cash. She wants to save up and use it for college. Plus the coinstar takes more to get cash! My kid is smart af!
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:55:38
So they let him keep 100 btc or did I read that wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:13:33
Yes you can! No one can say but I️ believe in blockchain tech. It’s definitely here to stay.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:42:55
My daughter is priceless! Hopefully I’ll be able to pay her college tuition with crypto lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:56:57
Family is also a good investment!
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:56:04
It’s 15% ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:16:20
Buy more and keep it. Or buy something off Newegg with it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:58:03
I helped a few people in my gf’s family buy their first cryptos and setup wallets! I️t was a lot of fun. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:47:12
I do that as well down here in Texas!
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:02:14
I use my ASICs to heat my greenhouses during the winter!
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:22:26
I’m not in Venezuela but they have a localbitcoins you could check out. Maybe find someone that mines. That’s a lot of BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-30 01:03:25
And the entrapment. They sold off his btc too!
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:56:07
I had my Bitcoins a year b4 then. I could only really use for drugs and pizza. I got scammed a few times out of a few thousand BTC as well. Some of those experimental one off batches of psychedelics were expensive. Stuff I’ll never ever find again. No regrets.
@_date: 2019-04-30 00:21:41
The dude that ran it went to the College a mile from where we lived! Nice guy.
@_date: 2019-04-29 22:27:04
Pfft I spent 27k btc on The Silk Road back in the day lol FML
@_date: 2019-04-30 10:51:06
It’s been a really long time and I’ve done a lot of drugs forgive my non exact time line from a decade of hard drug use.you can believe me or not I really don’t care. I went through an insane amount of crypto back in the day.
@_date: 2019-04-30 19:34:41
@_date: 2019-04-30 01:10:51
It’s not too bad though Bitcoin has been good to me over the years.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:28:12
I’m 30 and put it on there last year.
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:33:04
My tinder says “Blockchain specialist” for my job lol
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:19:44
I’m actually not. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:24:12
Yeah sometimes!
I also garden so it could be that. I’m not too sure. I have pictures of me hodling a L3+ and another picture of me gardening and one with my cat. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:29:27
They are actually using it! They are also putting it onto a prepaid debt card to go buy supplies in Colombia soon.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:56:09
Same thing for my wife but on Kraken :/
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:37:48
Happy holidays! Cheers mate. Thanks for being so nice!
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:13:43
I'll have to look into that. I've never heard of OpenDimes before. It's basically a physical coin with .01 on it? Like actual coinage?
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:20:05
Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:56:04
I met him at a party while he was attending UTD. It was lit! He was a really nice guy.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:50:52
I mean they asked her to send Bitcoin specifically. So I assume enough people are using it. I'm not talking with her family directly, I just helped buy and send the Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:06:15
I'm in DFW and I'll gladly pay for food with BTC! 
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:31:06
Pay off your debts. Set aside money for the children to go to college. Hold at least 70% of that. Go do whatever you have wanted to do with your life! I would buy land farm and and feed people.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:45:32
They live in the city and their money is worth very little right now. Lots of people are turning to crypto! 
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:55:14
I know from a friend of a friend one of the owners of some of the BTC ATM's in the Dallas area. I can ask if he will speak with you or answer some questions. It's a ton of work and he can't get a vacation!
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:39:49
I use my Barclays account to pull cash out from their exchange! ��
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:34:17
I hodl because last time I cashed was 2014 and missed out on a metric ton of money.
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:48:42
It wasn’t on my screen I’m not sure what’s up. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:54:42
Yes I sell fresh veggies from my garden for crypto!
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:09:15
You can buy fresh veggies from me with crypto if you’re in my neighborhood lol
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:54:19
It’s a credit union and I’ve been with them for years. I use it because my job only does direct deposit. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:52:49
Sold right under 5k bought at 3k it's been a great week!
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:38:21
I’ve been helping my friend send Btc to their family in Venezuela for a year plus now. It’s so much faster than a money order and they lose a large portion of it from fees. Keep up the good work! I’m send good vibes and crypto to your country ❤️ Have you ever thought about setting up a small scale mining farm? One day mining would make more than you do in a month sadly.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:25:10
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:20:08
They just can’t compete with BTCs uptime! It’s infuriating to not be able to pay my bills even though I have the money for it. Plus I can only withdraw 250.00 a day so it takes me 3 days to pull out rent unless I want to cough up more money for a money order. 
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:24:32
My new coworker came from Venezuela. He used his paycheck to buy some mining hardware and saved up 2Bitcoin to bring his family here. Bitcoin is saving so many people over there! I’m still sending a bit of Bitcoin to my friends family every few weeks!
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:54:33
No clue lol
@_date: 2018-07-28 23:37:12
Daily withdrawal limit of 250 cash and I can only spend like 1k at a time with my card lol
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:27:19
You’re welcome! Wish I could do more. Sorry y’all are having to suffer down there.
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:31:14
I love this! I sell fresh veggies from my garden on my bicycle and accept crypto. It’s always fun introducing people to crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:30:47
I use Avalons they are 599 USD with a PSU. Maybe check out Blokforge and send them an email. They might even hook you up with one for a good cause! I’m sure it would just be considered a tax write off for them. It couldn’t hurt to ask!
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:20:32
I did read how much he earns. That's why I suggested getting a miner. He already has some Crypto if he had enough he could order one or they could possibly send him one to help his cause. Just trying to help with ideas. I'm also a gardener. I could send them seeds from my seed bank if that would help with food.
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:28:29
Not all of it. I unfortunately sold off a small fortune of BTC in 2014 just holding and mining what’s leftover.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:35:38
I hope it goes up because all that btc I had gave me bch 
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:35:13
Put a piece of tape over your webcam when you’re not using it. Jeez
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:07:02
I ride fixie as well �� 
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:54:22
We have a big financial convention at my hotel and my coworker told some of them in into Bitcoin so we had some really nice discussions. Some other people overheard and asked me a few questions as well. It’s fun talking about it with random people. Nice to see so much interest in blockchain tech!
