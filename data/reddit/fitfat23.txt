Sounds like you agree that having it controlled by more than one thing can lead to less chance that it gets hacked. Now apply that logic to its logical conclusion.

They regulate each other through consensus. This is why the only way to change the Blockchain to give yourself coins is to have 51% of the total hashing power on your control. 
People have self interest, and since everyone is interested in mining to make money, no group has been able to gain that much hashing power. And if they did, and they altered the blockchain like that, it would destroy the value of bitcoin, and thus the investment they put into mining.

People have tried. Hacking bitcoin is the ultimate hack, and despite the billions to be made, nothing has been able to hack it. 
If it was all on one super computer, then all it would take is to hack that one computer. To hack every single computer on the bitcoin network? Good luck, people have tried and failed.

I'm poor because I'm in med school tbh. But you do have a good point. I really should just go ahead and become more financially literate.

One guy I called told me it's 700 per amended return :/
I figured I could do it myself, but is it even worth it to learn and figure all this out?
Based on the Bitcoin tax website, and my old taxes, I would owe the IRS about $400. Does the IRS care about this?
Will they come at me with penalties if I do an amended return?
Like I said, I don't have much money, and a CPA would cost me my rent money.

This is what I was hoping they would view it as. That the few hundred is not worth their time and resources. But you really think they care to?
