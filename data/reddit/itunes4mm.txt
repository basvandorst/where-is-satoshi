what? if money supply is shrinking, people will SAVE their money not SPEND their money , have you ever taken economics? yikes
@_date: 2018-09-17 00:38:01
but in this theoretical world where bitcoin is relevant in the world economy... why would people spend if it is deflationary and the "rarity" will go up therefore increasing value. It would cause major hoarding instead of investing in equity or goods etc keeping the economy flowing, no matter how inequal either method is rich people will still be rich
@_date: 2018-09-17 23:35:04

@_date: 2018-09-16 18:41:01
ok then lol.. you can put your money nearly anywhere and keep up or pass inflation which is very low right now. People don't hoard cash nearly as much as equity which is different than BTC where people hoard the principal. I bet the top 10 btc holders hold more than 98% of holders too which seems a bit worse than the USD issue. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:59:12
alright.. and what about people hoarding like they do now? the inflation system although sometimes its a bit of a bailout atleast keeps people spending $ and investing in companies etc. BTC incentivizes you to hoard it and never spend

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:10:54

@_date: 2018-11-20 17:54:12
how often do you pay fees? it costs more for me to get $ into bitcoin than any fee ive ever paid banking or credit/debit card wise
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:50:46
Oh look nobody responding to you 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:00:01
40% where do you live lmao
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:11:49
Yes.. Just like how a payment PROCESSOR won't have your money when they go bankrupt. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:35:16
1. No, I don't trust every merchant to deliver so I use a credit card.
4. No. They can't just steal money if they go bankrupt, that's the same if any crypto thing like bitpay went under
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:57:36
just wondering.. who is holding their life savings in cash? that's just dumb and I hope you let those people know that is a bad idea
