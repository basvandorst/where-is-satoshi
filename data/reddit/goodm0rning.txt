Just remember confirmation time as in 6 confirmations/1 hour it protects you with 1 hour of mining. That's huge! 
Now don't believe the shitlitecoin propaganda they feed you. Their 6 confirmations take only 6 minutes or whatever. I would wait for 60 eg 1 hour of protection.
It's not the number it's the time. 1 btc confirmation = 6 ltc.

Price doesn't give a shit anymore, funny seeing people shorting and the price going up. They hit 422 shorting 200 Bitcoin.
There's many stealth companies buying all the Bitcoin they can right now before they launch. Want to know why circle won't launch? Once one launches Bitcoin will explode, they aren't done buying yet. They want cheap coins but won't let it drop very much because confidence will decrease. Holding $450 like a rock.
