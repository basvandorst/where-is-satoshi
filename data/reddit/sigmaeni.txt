He's not blind. Can't you see he's just wearing those sunglasses due to the beautiful weather?

Exactly greater or less than 50/50. Error bars of zero.

But god help us if it goes backwards.

Surely you're mistaken. I'm stating unequivocally the approximation of certain unknown probabilities with ultimate precision. Possibly.
@_date: 2019-11-29 01:56:30
One thing's for sure: it might go up.

Fellow friends - I too have seen the front page of Reddit today, and perceive the reference! Let us enjoy this moment together.

You *could*, certainly. Whether you *should* is a scholarly debate which has raged for centuries. 
SwoonMath is not intended to be better at indicating future up or down than any other indicator. In fact in the previously mentioned FAQ, it's suggested that the whole project is just for fun. It really shouldn't be used as any kind of primary indicator (you can see how bad some of the chart versions match with the long term trend, etc). I often simply use it to reflect market sentiment, and marvel at "oh look it's going past the green line today! that's neat!", that sort of thing.
However, if you look back over time, the magic of Hindsight will show that you could have used it to make a buck or two! Will it help with that henceforth? The answer is *dunno*.
If I had a few bucks to spend, I may look at the last graph on the site, and see the white price line within the dark blue region, and perhaps spend a few dollars on some BTC, presuming it's at a "low" point and may go up, even if slowly. But as you can see, it could go down BELOW the dark blue...
So have fun with it, but don't rely on it. Unless you wanna. I'm not your mom :)

Never consider yourself dumb for wanting to learn something unfamiliar!
The charts are a way to watch what the BTC price has done over time, with respect to different regression math applied to them. They're not intended to be predictive, but rather to see if there may be support/resistance evidence in the various fits. It shouldn't be taken as any kind of ultra-sciency indicator of what dat BTC gonna do, or any such thing. It's just a fun way to look at the prices and see how some unique math fits it. You may be able to get a better sense of the different charts by [checking out the FAQ](
Any input u/jarederaj ?
edit: never unput your input

And I'll cart a carrot.

Fun fact, also: it need not be illegal to warrant the desire for privacy.

You must lift the curse. Or we are all doomed. Send me your BTC, so the curse may be lifted.

I'm in you, son of a bitch.
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:06:45
No worries, I'm just being an average Reddit pedant ;) Carry on!
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:49:38
Both are important, as is grammar.

False. I'm the Gov't. You're totes laundering [your own] money [to yourself]. Many illegal. Now gimme all ur stuff!
