There is a difference between taking MDMA recreationally (what you have done - and probably too much) and taking small doses in a therapeutic setting with someone supervising you.

The fee to open the channel is like the transaction fee now. You pay it to the miners, because you still need one transaction to open the channel on the blockchain (and another one for closing).

Because it is on the damn testnet. Of course there is no hub pattern. (And the mainnet does not represent actual usage yet, because only enthusiasts are using it.)
If you think about it for even a second it is obvious that hubs will form. 
Let me explain: In LN you can only pay a person as much money as all of your outgoing channels, that are also connected to your target, have in balance. That means you can pay more if you connect to people that can put more money into a channel.
That means the most connected people will be the ones that have the most money to tie up. 
If you take into account that not many people can open multiple channels &gt;$100, they will probably only open a few channels. To get the most out of it, they open channels with someone that is well connected already and has a high capacity.
This will result in a hub pattern.

The thing is that there are instant remedies that could be used to scale BTC right now and not only in 6+ months .
@_date: 2014-09-26 14:53:20
Digital goods will be a test ground for PayPal to test the widespread adoption of Bitcoin. It does not mean that they will never offer full bitcoin integration with their service. 
So the price going up is justified. Doesn't mean that everyone thought they accept bitcoin for everything. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:54:31
Another thing I had not yet considered, good point :)
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:37:47
I try to clarify. If you want to make a single four output transaction you need 4 adresses to send the bitcoins to.
So now you can not immediately give one single person a withdraw, because you need 2 other people to withdraw too.
That's why you split it up into more adresses. So you can give single transactions instantly.
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:50:03
That makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up for me. :) I am pretty new here. ^^
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:18:54
Probably will be up tomorrow. Did not find it on ProSieben's site.
@_date: 2014-02-05 05:19:03
Who said that? 
@_date: 2014-04-23 07:18:36
Because it is the most stable state for Bitcoin to be in.  Much harder for all people to divide in more pools because they have to check which are the less common used. If you just join a pool without checking you have less work and a monopoly starts to form. 
Don't want to say that it's obvious, but it happens in nature, too. Look at trees. They could all have an agreement to only grow 20cm,  so everyone gets enough sun. The moment one tree starts to grow larger, the others have to grow also. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 06:36:09
You clearly have not read the announcement. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 11:33:22
Then you would have to wait for four people trying to withdraw their bitcoins. Bitcoin.de does it like that and the withdrawal takes up to 2 hours. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:18:19
Yeah, didn't know how to describe it in a few words. That's my major fear, too.
@_date: 2014-02-08 12:34:45
You know that doge is fundamentally different from Bitcoin because it is inflationary by nature? No way doge will overtake bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-05 08:01:33
Then hopefully the lightning network will be ready and we have no problem. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:17:04
You can have less large transactions in 1MB. Large transaction means it has many inputs and outputs. 
If you only have simple transactions (1 input, 2 outputs) more fit into 1MB
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:37:53
Have you heard about the EEA (and its members) in combination with the second biggest altcoin? I would research a bit more if I were you. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:12:19
You know, it is not Bitcoins (the protocols) fault. 
Is it the Internets fault when a website gets hacked and passwords get stolen? No. It is just a protocol. Same here. It is not the fault of bitcoin if some wallet allows you to spend 0.5BTC as fee. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:51:57
Can you tell me why it is not possible to increase the block size for the short term while figuring out other scaling mechanisms for the long term?
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:35:58
You clearly have no idea how bitcoin works. Even if there would be excess computing power, after a while the difficulty would go up to compensate for it. 
On average there will never be more than one block per 10 minutes. Even if you quadrupled the miners.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:14:10
The passwords were hashed and salted. So basically nothing happened. 
LP just told users to change their passwords to be safe.
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:18:57
Right, because we have so much historical data to go from. (No, we do not.)
Nobody knows what will eventually happen.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:10:17
There is no infinite inflation with Eth. Bitcoin currently has 4% inflation rate. You need to see that Eth is younger than Bitcoin, and therefore the rate of eth is higher. Just look at the inflation rate of Bitcoin in the previous years.
And miners will not be always subsidised, because the system will change from PoW to PoS if all goes well. 
Then a negative (or very low) inflation rate (with Eth used for Transactions and burned) is possible.
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:35:40
Which does not provide real world situations. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:00:04
Remember to activate 2-factor authentication if you use blockchain or another online wallet, so that if your login credentials are compromised your BTC aren't stolen.
Best thing would be trying out a local/offline wallet with maybe $5 worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-27 09:02:10
Because you can buy a Ledger for $15. Easy to setup and easy to recover in case of a screw up. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 06:35:35
So what is small enough? Is 1MB okay? 500kb? 
Who gets to decide what blocksize is small? I am genuinely curious about your view on this.
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:56:31
Because they have different use-cases? 
As long as rootstock is not ready, BTC does not allow programming of smart contracts.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:28:46
The reason to go with ETH will be PoS (if it works out). PoW is not future proof. 
And forks are not bad. Not planned ones at least.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:32:36
They get part of the fees paid for using Rootstock.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:47:33
You can't do ENS on Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:40:39
Following your logic you could also say you can do Solidity smart contracts directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Just need to modify Bitcoin a bit.
You can't do it at the moment. You need a hardfork for it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:53:13
Smart contracts are an actual use. Look at the ENS for example. Very practical.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:30:04
The same could be said about hard forks. 'Hard forks don't split the chain, only miners not using the new client will split the chain.' 
In the case of a hard fork miners will also try to prevent a chain split. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:58:26
Technically you still need to pay taxes though.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:42:08
What has Enteth got to do with the ENS?
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:38:29
If they are based on the exchange rate you could have invested in bitcoin in the first place. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:03:08
There is one thing I don't understand about Bitcoin and an 'Offline' Wallet. 
As far as I understand it you can install a program on your PC and it will create a wallet (without internetaccess) with a public adress and a corrosponding private key. 
So far so good. What I don't understand is couldn't it be possible for someone else to get the same public adress (and therefore my btc)?  And how does the network know if the private key I created offline 'opens' the wallet? How is it possible for my off-network created adress to be unique?
I think I don't fully understand the concept and would be happy if someone could enlighten me.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:07:49
That's what I thought. Thanks :)
