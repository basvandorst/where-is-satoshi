Can you sell this much (any?) OTC via Kraken for example and stay anon? I wouldn't count on it
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:02:37
Let's be real here. You are angry because his best interest if not in your/our best interest. You say what you want instead

Weak hands = people that didn't lose 15% in 24 hours. Can we stop with this stupidity already?
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:42:47
Wow! If I had known that I would have bought my fiancee a bitcoin ring instead of a gold ring
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:53:02
lol, I bet you got in late 2017 or early 2018. Strong hands like you = people that proudly tell the world they aren't no weak hands that got out before strong hands lost 70%

It seems like people are just dreaming about this. The SEC has already said why they won't approve an ETF, because anonymous people can manipulate the markets. It's not like that is going to change

He speaks the truth, I was there as well. Afterwards we took my private jet and sailed into the sunset
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:13:02
Could you elaborate on this? Who holds the keys to the wallet?
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:24:44
Where did you buy that tinfoil hat? I'm been looking for top quality hats but so far no luck
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:26:12
Yes, mid 2013
@_date: 2018-09-04 23:28:45
What can I say, it's a good private jet
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:21:01
Where there anything at all similar to calculators before they were introduced? No.
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:29:37
I'm sold! It's only a matter of time before our 10 year old currency becomes the global reserve!

Of all the arguments for Bitcoin, energy consumption is probably the worst
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:31:19
As we can all see $6000 is nothing. I'm gonna go live in my bitcoins now, it's clearly undervalued
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:34:58
Is there anyone of importance behind the SV? If Bitmain and Ver gets behind bcash core (lol) then that will obviously be the main one. Say what you will about Ver but having bitcoin.com is powerful

When are we expecting the result of the ETF coming tomorrow? Since we might not be in the same timezone then approx hours from now would be great. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:22:55
It's just bs. How much wash trading is there daily? A whole lot
@_date: 2018-08-25 01:09:18
Is there a way to know if you had any btc there when it closed down? I used mtgox and got a mail about it but I'm not sure if I had anything left
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:37:49
Do you have a link to that one perhaps? I do know my password. Edit, found it. only five bucks there, probably not worth the hassle
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:42:03
Yes, I found it. Only five bucks there unfortunately. Since I was so reckless with money back then it could have been a bunch lol

2020 Bitcoin prices will be $250 million, says prominent guesser wheresmypitchfork
@_date: 2018-10-28 18:17:31
This is why I always laugh at people saying bitcoin is a cult. This post proves it is not!
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:11:01
He probably loves to hate it. Don't we all have the same love-hate relationships regarding something? Bitcoiners usually love to hate other coins, USD etc
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:49:10
Isn't that the guy who called 60k btc 2018?
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:54:50
The weak hands bullshit is so pathetic. Imagine if you had 1k btc in 2013. Sold at $900. Bought back at $250, you now have 3600 btc. Then you sold at 15k and bought back at 4,5k. Unlike the strong hands that laugh at the weak hands, you now have 12k btc vs their 1k. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:13:40
No, the difference is that I'm not screaming like a child that people are stupid for holding, unlike the morons who feel compelled to call people who sold "weak".
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:51:19
To be fair it was assembly iirc
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:07:48
Don't worry, anyone who would think up a fake text like this would never get a girlfriend
@_date: 2018-11-17 09:14:45
I feel so sorry for the weak men who sold at 20, 19, 18k etc. Now they aren't strong, independent men like us
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:20:07
Because by selling the future for the past I acquired 30% more future
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:03:31
Of course most people do not make perfect calls, which is why I didn't make perfect calls in my example. In fact, I used a 25% drop in the second one. Can't remember what the peak was in 2013
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:27:05
This just goes back to the old saying "everyone I disagree with is a nazi". It truly is a great argument, almost every teen on reddit is using it.
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:26:42
It seems like one of those losers screaming "weak hands are selling" got offended
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:25:27
Upvoted this to begin with but since you keep dodging post regarding seeking a lawyer and doing illegal stuff you're probably not going to get your money back
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:15:41
Yes, I'm sure this billionaire goes around telling everyone exactly what he did and when
