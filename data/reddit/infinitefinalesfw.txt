This was in Vegas; there's a Casino on Fremont that accepts bitcoin.  I saw it there last week, was pleasantly surprised.

I've noticed the same thing.  This is pretty ridiculous.

This contributes nothing to this discussion, why is it being upvoted?

[edit] Not sure why I'm getting downvoted into oblivion.  The man asked for a discussion, and I've discussed some things with him.  CAVIRTEX may not be popular, but he's here to try to address this.  We don't need the downvote bitcoin mob here.
Hi Kyle,
I've been using CAVIRTEX for my exchange needs since about August 2013 when I tried to pull out of GOX and failed.  Thankfully, I didn't have much in with them (only ~$300 CAD).
I've had nothing but good experiences with you guys.  Verification was easy.  While trading fees were high, I still managed to do day trading and make money, and I'm happy you've slashed fees in half.
I've also had the chance to speak with Mike over the phone, and I'm excited to make use of your API. 
When will I get the API info?  I had a phone discussion with Mike to go over providing the necessary info, but I don't recall when he said I'd receive the API documentation.
I'd also like to see more charts specifically on CAVIRTEX, rather than just a link to bitcoincharts.com.  I'm looking for min/max trades for at least the last week, ideally the last 30 days in a simple tabular format, along with volumes.  I'm hoping I can mine this data through the API, but having it readily available up front would be lovely as well.
You've got reduced trading fees after large volumes of Bitcoins - will we be seeing this for other coins as well?  You've added Litecoins to your trading platform, I was hoping to see a similar system in place there.
Thanks for being here Kyle!

Awesome!  Just heard from Mike, that was fast!  Thanks!

Because you can buy a bunch of bitcoins at $50, and now spend them at $500!

I'm not sure, but do any BTC ATMs allow for cash trades?

The website's gone down.  I approved my payment, but haven't received it yet... anyone have any news?
