an unrelated question, how do you register on Ogrr.com? they don't have any kind of registration and OTP doesn't seem to send anything to my email?

AurumXchange's logo in that article shows it can allow you to withdraw BTC directly to your debit card. Although, i don't see any mention of such feature on their webpage?
@_date: 2012-10-18 16:32:58
they accept BTC as deposit and withdrawal? 
@_date: 2012-11-16 11:52:21
what do we have here

Why was bit coins to UK bank withdrawal lifted anyways?

I seem to never get it to work. Everytime I try and click on "Play" button. Nothing happens?
@_date: 2012-12-05 00:34:25
is that a website?
@_date: 2012-10-30 21:56:57
that is an exchange being hacked. directly relating it with bitcoin itself is absurd.
@_date: 2012-11-03 08:07:42
Nice! this is really nice! i can see myself spending BTC there sometime! hope they can succeed and community supports it.
Though, I'd like it if the price was initially mentioned in BTC with BTC currency logo with it, and USD price can be mentioned in brackets if necessary.

thanks, mate

Dubai doesn't practice death penalty. Not that I know of. It's really open when comes to everything. Very modern. But there's only 1 proper internet company, and it too practices strong internet censorship.

I don't have trust issue with this business, personally, but why put a minimum order limit?
@_date: 2012-10-06 06:10:42
I would love to try and decode that. Wish my English was that superior. :(
edit: nvm, figured it out. lol
@_date: 2012-12-05 09:57:36
i'm in dubai, united arab emirates. i'd like to sell these btc for liberty reserve if possible.
@_date: 2012-11-04 08:48:37
I think your mixing United Arab Emirates with Korea?
@_date: 2012-10-30 06:02:27
For reals? It happened?
@_date: 2012-11-04 11:19:08
Yes, you can easily fund CashU account in UAE and buy bitcoins through Bitcoinnordic.com. though I haven't tried it yet, it seems simple. I do have a CashU account.
@_date: 2012-11-22 12:22:28
I've been lurking around ogrr.com for quite a few days. forums, at the moment, is very inactive. very few people are actively trading in there.
@_date: 2012-10-19 03:35:47
I can't seem to find any players on it. Is that usual for all the BTC pokers?
@_date: 2012-10-06 06:09:01
thank you for such a detailed answer. really helps! props!
@_date: 2012-10-30 05:32:55
Bitcoin's been hacked? lulwut. no.
@_date: 2012-11-04 08:18:32
These seems like really nice options. I'm learning more towards Mullavad, though. Does anyone know if PIA and Mullavad both changes my IP/Geo location on skype as well? I mean, there are some heavy voip bans in place here. So if I'm using Mullavad/PIA, will it change my IP/geo-location to get me through regional restriction?
I'm sorry if i'm sounding all noobish, i've been advised VPN tons of times with all my friends to avoid all the sorts of tracking and stuff. I hate that. So, one more questions: will my whole network be changed to the IP address that is given to me? Which means if I'm on Skype, playing online video game or using yahoo. Will I be shown to these software that I am from VPN's region, or will it still show that I'm from Dubai, UAE?
EDIT: Bought 1 month on PIA to test their services. US region VPN is really slow when it comes to streaming videos. Other UK/EU region VPN they provide are providing less then half my original internet speed (according to speedtest.net). Is this something normal with VPNs?

Is the transfer between BTC addres and this debit card instant? or does it take time? what are the fees margin?
@_date: 2012-10-28 21:14:30
Somebody said something like the more you lose, the more the chances of winning increases? Is that true?
Also I tried betting through the option you just told me. I bet and after a few minutes I got my bet back into my wallet. Weird. Since I didn't get any instant BTCs, i thought I had lost the bet. It's very confusing. lol

So did FBI arrest you when you come to USofA? what happened next?
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:47:56
I was actually considering at one point to turn BTC into gold or silver sometime soon using coinabul. After this, I wouldn't be too sure.
@_date: 2013-06-04 02:54:42
normal exchange sites. different e-currencies. prior to LR seize, they use to deal majorly in LR and then second most popular being BTC.
@_date: 2013-01-14 08:35:46
As far as I know the currency itself is 100% legit. The use of the currency is what matters.

they do take up to 48 hours for first few times to avoid Paypal chargeback. You shouldn't be concerned. Not many places lets you convert Paypal funds to Bitcoins. I'd be content if I were you.

It is easily determined. If my website gets 10,000 pageviews from random nodes somewhere and all of a sudden I am getting 20,000 pageviews or 30k or 40k pageviews with similar behavior from single or multiple nodes, it's classified as DDOS. I'm sure web devs have many tools to determine if the attack is DDOS or popularity surge (highly unlikely).
@_date: 2013-05-21 22:55:02
So if I played MC. I can actually gamble at this BitVegas for bitcoins? Like a real casino?
@_date: 2013-02-07 17:01:43
I see Etisalat on the sidebar. I can't see United Arab Emirates under the countries list?
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:04:48
wow. i'd definitely give it a go sometime soon.
@_date: 2013-01-24 23:54:12
There are more then 3 threads, including this one. About the price drop? Check the reddit before posting. lol

If I prove that I am not a US citizen, can I still continue my USD code withdrawal or is it being removed globally? I am not a US citizen.
@_date: 2013-02-17 11:47:56
Yes, no active purchaser sadly.
@_date: 2013-01-28 14:29:03
I've a feeling that paypal funds are sent to the seller accounts. Bitcoins themselves must be deposited into Bitcoinary's escrow account for a certain period of time to be released when the seller is content with the trade. I might be wrong.
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:25:16
I was at one point even considering keeping my money in banks. No thanks sir. I'd rather keep it in bitcoins instead, even tho BTC maybe volatile.
@_date: 2013-05-21 09:05:17
scam. don't pay any heed. report this comment.
@_date: 2013-05-28 22:07:27
isn't there a website for your service? or some sort of feedback thread or something? This is the first time I have heard of your service.
@_date: 2013-02-08 10:18:09
aw, good luck. would love to use this service :)

I'm a huge gamer. I would love to see bitcoin adaptation in gaming industry. Like buying games and paying for their monthly subscription by bitcoins. That'd some next level shit.
Gaming industry is huge. Imagine each and every game/MMORPG developers accepting Bitcoins as a payment. This would make things much much easier.
@_date: 2013-03-27 05:23:46
That too. But the fact that he himself sent the wire and probably underwent proper authorization, the transaction should had went through. But nope. Even when they told him that the transaction is suspicious, I bet OP tried to convince them that it wasn't?
@_date: 2013-01-28 15:06:33
so is escrow system automatic? meaning it releases bitcoins after a certain period automatically or it is dependant on the seller to release them? how this whole system works? If you can explain it a few steps. that'd be great.
@_date: 2013-02-13 09:43:04
Coinbase makes me nervous. Why does it seem like buying from them is a 50/50 bet? People buying from them have to post about their order being cancelled or processed isn't very appealing.
@_date: 2013-01-11 07:09:31
From $100/day to 100 BTC/day. That's some climb!
@_date: 2013-03-14 04:14:08
No transaction fee? How do you guys make profit then?
@_date: 2013-01-31 11:33:56
that URL is for some reason blocked in my country. Is Mega.co.nz accepting bitcoin as payments?
@_date: 2013-03-27 05:20:55
don't worry. same thing happened to me a while ago and I sort of panicked. Contacted support. They responded quickly and told me that at times the deposit can be delayed. But that particular day was way slow that they had to announce that deposits are slow. It took me like 12-14 hours to get bitcoins deposited into my Mt.Gox account.
Make sure that you have sent the bitcoins to the valid btc address provided to you to deposit on mtgox account. Contacting support might help as well.
@_date: 2013-01-10 16:41:33
Register @  fees are ridiculous and heavy exchange rates applies. But it is possible to instantly convert your Ukash vouchers for Bitcoins on Virwox. Other then that, you can try bitcointalk.org and see if someone is willing to trade Ukash for Bitcoins.
