Or jail broken phones?
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:15:44
Jail broken bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:24:13
Source on that number?
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:59:47
Me too?
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:15:46
If you can't find coffee for $1, you're not looking.

However, a search for "circle bitcoin" has it on the first result.
@_date: 2014-12-05 15:16:31
Source on those numbers too? Even if it were true, it wouldn't account for the number the guy I posted a reply to posted.
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:48:16
Probably @_date: 2015-01-22 19:45:31
Oh. It's okay. I just thought you were trying to link to some article or something and accidentally posted a picture of some dirty sneakers.
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:43:33
Lol if you say so.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:57:46
Thanks for telling me! Damn paycoiners *shakes fist* 
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:51:01
Qtqr is a great qr code Ubuntu application.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:01:11
How much do your fucking shopping carts cost if a bitcoin will only get you a shopping cart?
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:07:41
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:23:53
The link doesn't work.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:02:19
I ordered a couple honey bears from you the other day, it's really delicious!
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:14:20
Hint: it's spelled "users," not "years."
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:10:44
I'm not buying marijuana seeds on the clearnet.
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:02:32
There's something in the settings for it, you might have accidentally turned it off.
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:29:12
Privateinternetaccess is what I've been using for a couple years now. They accept bitcoin and I've never had any trouble with them. It works well on android and pc.
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:34:55
It's a picture of muddy shoes for me. I don't know how this is proof of ASICs.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:40:43
I thought they kept logs their servers. Privateinternetaccess doesn't.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:22:09
I can label my transactions in mycelium, electrum, and greenaddress. Which wallet are you using that you can't?
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:52:31
I think they've talked about running Armory on the pi, and said that it was a bit too heavy for it
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:40:23
There are probably more criminals using USD then criminals using BTC
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:59:25
You could probably run electrum on a raspberry pi, it doesn't have to download the blockchain to work.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:55:25
[Screenshot]( if anyone is interested.
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:30:24
The price didn't drop $5 because of you, almost certainly.
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:09:42
Thanks for your sacrifice, my coins are now slightly more valuable.
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:25:10
Huh. Well, I've got no clue then, sorry :(
@_date: 2015-01-22 03:12:10
No problem!
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:31:18
No, but I don't really need them to be, but at least you can label them within the application.
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:33:25
It took me a couple weeks to be verified with them, you just gotta message them and not let them forget about you.
@_date: 2016-12-19 03:34:03
Yes, 2k bits per second is well within even a dial up connection. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:20:34
Look at the hardware wallet. It's pretty much exactly what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:52:15
And you can't buy things with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:31:08
Saving this comment for later.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:42:02
@_date: 2015-02-08 16:27:10
That's fine, I love to buy miniatures.
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:20:51
That sounds suspiciously like a troll comment.
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:45:49
No, you have $.20. If you had .2 bitcoin it would be more like $40
