You can sue them all you want. Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:10:13
I don't get how?
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:54:18
I don't intend to sell ever; I use btc for goods and services. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 20:24:21
That's a pretty fucking epic feat though. I bet the return was pretty good for how much time he probably put into it.

There is a huge difference between 'RTFM' and 'born in a fucked up place', your argument is invalid. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:29:28
You've read it before because "we told you so" - that place has been shady as fuck since it was a MTG exchange, but not everyone saw that over the $$$
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:51:16
If they wanna be progressive, they're gonna have to pay for their mistake of ever utilizing apple technology. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:56:16
Also, do research first. I googled mt gox and within about 30 seconds was like NOPE on customer reviews alone
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:00:09
convert to Android
Why use a decentralized currency, then on the other hand use fucking apple? This does not compute.

Cluttered code is one thing but this looks like he pulled his pants down and shitted all over his codebase
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:52:29
Karpeles needs to commit [seppuku]( It's the only way for him to restore any honor. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:00:48
shit code ftw I reckon
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:53:41
HELLO HOW CAN I GET THIS ON MY APPLE DEVICE 
PLEASE HELP
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:20:41
I was just kidding, I fucking hate apple, just for this reason. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:59:45
easier to just convert to Android
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:57:07
Yeah old mark did a pretty good job too didn't he
This sloppiness is why he failed
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:58:47
Because if you were dumb enough to do business with gox, you're dumb enough to fall for this. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:42:28
PS cunt

There are only about 17M coins in existence right now. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:19:25
I stand corrected. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:01:13
holy shit did I just see a republican senator do this
someone pinch me
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:27:51
You don't have to get a Droid; any phone that runs Android should be good.
