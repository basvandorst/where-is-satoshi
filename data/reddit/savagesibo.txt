I'm a Norwegian, and I downloaded the app through my US iTunes account. Worked like a charm, but after entering mye name, address (I have a US postal address for shipping), my city and country, phone number etc. they finally asked for my social security number, so registering is not possible unless you have that. 
I'm able to use the app without being a registered user though, but basically the only thing you can do is to check the prices in a sexy looking way.

Scandinavian here. No clue what you're talking about at all. But TRON is shit anyways.

What about BTG in Electrum? I have the exact same "issue", and I'm wondering how to claim my BTG which was in electrum at the time.

But this messes up my cost amount. If I bought BTC for $1000 and then immediately transfered it to let's say Bitfinex and then traded it to IOTA, those $1000 will still be in my BTC cost...

If you only can afford to invest such a small amount, your gains may be extremely valuable for you, no matter how “little” it will be. Watch out for fees, and don’t spend more than you can afford to loose. Good luck, buddy!

I’ve never sold. Been buying since early September, right before the big dip. Didn’t buy any during the sub3k dip, as I had no clue what I was doing. Sucks. But still having awesome gains

1. A lot of new users wanting to learn about Bitcoin
2. Security

Yeah, that's why I don't store any funds on an exchange. A hardware or paper wallet can secure you from this though.

Literally just stumbled across this prime example post on a Facebook group with over 47,000 members. I would be terrified.

lol great

No. You should be able to loose it all without going bankrupt. Invest, but not more than you’re willing to loose. The risk goes both ways, so make sure you have more than one foot under your legs if shit hits the fan.

Mine sometimes says $19,146 or something like that. Always extremely disappointed after a refresh.

Can't see any option of doing that in Electrum, though. How much would 50 sat/byte be in total, with let's say 1 BTC?

Have you never learned Lambos are yellow, and Ferraris are red?

As a professional filmphotographer I feel so ashamed. Then I realized over 50% of my commercial work these days involves turning our $15,000 camera sideways to create Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook ads. Damn you 2018.
