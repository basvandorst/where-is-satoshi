Easy to punch, better than average melting point, and great corrosion resistance. If you don't want the patina, simply spray it with lacquer after punching it.
I practiced on the aluminium before punching the copper.
Cryptosteel is a great value IMO. It didn't exist when I went through this exercise =)
If you do go with cut2sizemetals, I used the copper rectangular 110 bar with a thickness of 3/16th. 3x5 inches. The price was $15 for each at the time. Punching a trezor word list on one and a password on the other is the best way to use this IMO. Keep the plates in different locations. It won't be beautiful but it gets the job done and you're better off than 99% of people out there. A third plate with a plausible deniability password is a nice touch.
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:37:22
Trezor already supports this by using a different password. The password is used to generate the BIP32 seed. Just add funds to both accounts.

Why should we trust Coinbase after they've assumed the security risk of supporting an untested and most likely insecure altcoin? Are bitcoin and fiat funds secure from future Coinbase specific eth loses? How much thought was given to segregating the backend bitcoin network/web/app/db from eth tiers? Also, if you don't mind my asking, who on your team was the architect for segmenting the two coins?

I'd get behind any kickstarter dedicated to designing and fabricating an open ASIC which would be sold at cost to individuals and non-profit mining organizations.
I've mentioned "activist-mining" in the past, but I believe the barrier to entry is just too high for most individuals. I'm investigating the formation of a 501c3 similar to  which would use donations to purchase and run mining equipment. Profits from mining would be used to purchase additional equipment. The obvious concern is that the majority of users simply won't care about the health of the network until it is too late.

* Mine on smaller pools first
* Manufacturers sell ASICs to power users (eg group buy) not farms only, not self-mine only
* Offer better discount to power users closer to farm bulk discount
* Start more ASIC companies or not-for-profit / open spec ASIC

Hey, My statement was based on comment here:
"Mixing" by transferring to and from a sidechain will get you an anonymity set which is the size of all outputs of the same size currently locked to that sidechain. If the sidechain is in active use this will always be a fairly large number, no timing gymnastics required."
Do either of you have a few minutes to clear up my confusion? It sounds like if X  users have 1 BTC locked in a sidechain and then I move 1 BTC in and out, my anonymity set would be equal to X. If I moved 1 BTC to a sidechain, performed a CT with myself for .5 sidecoins then transfer them out would my anonymity set be equal to all .5 BTC outputs currently locked in the sidechain?
I'm obviously struggling with some aspect of how transactions performed in a sidechain link to the BTC locked in a sidechain.

You're asking the right questions. The answers depend on how much time you're willing to spend researching.

The fact they they need passwords to restore user's coins is proof that they are doing what they say they are doing. They don't have access to your funds. Sure, they could have coded up a better way to transfer credentials, but the fact remains, they are getting funds back to users.

The backup code will only get you signed into your google account. Once in, you'll need to setup two-factor authentication again (scan another barcode). Once completed, you'll only have access to your google account; the other accounts will not be imported. If you want to avoid this in the future, you have a few options.

You should really just test your theory to get a better understanding of the recovery process.
That said, if an unencrypted copy of your wallet.dat file has ever touched dropbox, consider your coins to be in serious risk of theft. Also understand the limitations of bitcoin-qt. If you generate more than 100 new addresses (by spending from your wallet) an old backup will not recover your funds. Because of this limitation, I would never suggest bitcoin-qt to a new user. Try Electrum or Armory and you never need to worry about backups again. Simply write your seed on paper and keep it safe.

I think the fact that Satoshi has remained anonymous reveals more about him than anything else.
He obviously had a deep understanding of anonymity before revealing anything about Bitcoin to the public. It should be obvious to most, but these privacy considerations are are very hard for people to grasp; Ross Ulbricht is a perfect example of this concept. Unlike Satoshi, Ulbricht's freedom depended on his ability to never make a single mistake in every word he made public. We all know how this played out...
I feel that it is a safe assumption that Satoshi was very aware of Stylometry and tried, to the best of his ability, to mask his linguistic style. In my opinion, the times reference in the genesis block and occasional uses of words like bloody and colour tell us Saotshi is NOT British.

Satoshi is obviously a cypherpunk. Digital currency has always been the holy grail of the movement. Bruce Schneier even has a section about it in his 1996 book Applied Cryptography (Section 6.4). Bitcoin was either created by someone that wrote publicly about digital currency or someone that closely followed those writing about it.

You're correct in thinking that BIP32 would only mitigate the issue. Any attempt to reuse an address from a past change address would reveal private keys under a duplicate R value scenario. The point to keep in mind is that two signatures (transactions) are required from one address to reveal that information. Even the reference wallet mitigates this by using change addresses.

I believe the math breaks if K=0 as all of the code I've looked at prevents it from being used. If an attacker has both your signature (a transaction on the blockchain) and the K value, your private key can be derived.
An attacker can only start targeting a weak K value if a transaction has occurred from the address (a signature exists). If a balance doesn't exist on the address, there is no incentive to attack K. In other words, address reuse creates an additional attack surface, albeit a random 256 bit value if done correctly. It would be easier to generate random addresses and hope you find a collision.

@_date: 2014-12-09 05:01:30
If you use BIP39 for the seed, you can get 128 bits out of a 12 word list. Case doesn't mater. I prefer this technique because most wallets seem to be in the process of adopting it (Trezor word list). A-Z is the only thing required for the stamp.
The best part about BIP32 is adding a salt/password to your seed which allows you to house the plates in different locations (plate1=salt, plate2=seed). The salt can also be something you simply memorize. Even better, you can setup fake wallets using the same seed but a different salt that only holds a fraction of your bitcoins. You can also incorporate multisig for crazy security.

You're obviously a sharp guy, Gibbs. You should give Satoshi a little more credit =) Wei Dai was even impressed with how robust the code was and I consider him a "world class" programmer. The style would be considered bad by today's standards; however, if the book is correct on the time line, bitcoin could have been coded in less than 10 months. Hal pretty much stated that he couldn't code in c++ due to the difficulty in getting it right. Dan Kaminsky thought Satoshi was insane for trying to code it in c++ until he tried to exploit it.

Even if every BIP32 wallet was abandoned, the specification is documented and the code to sweep a BIP32 wallet is open source. 
You'd never need to do it but by using something like pybitcointools ( you can recover all of your funds from the seed in about 10-15 lines of code. Additional code would be required if you're restoring from a mnemonic phrase that represents your seed.
BIP32 uses one seed to recover your entire wallet. This includes all possible change addresses. With bitcoin-qt, if you use more change addresses than your backup contains, you'll lose money. This problem doesn't exist with BIP32. It also helps that the guy that wrote the specification is a core developer.
I use a Trezor because I like the "offline" signing aspect. Electrum would be a good option if you're not worried about online signing even though you should be.
@_date: 2014-07-27 11:55:02
1. Download a BIP32 wallet and verify the software with the published checksum/signing key
2. Put the software on an offline computer using a livecd
3. Verify the checksum/signing key again
4. Generate a wallet and write down the master seed
5. Never deal with change address backup problems again

As always, great video. This is one of my favorite descriptions of brute forcing large numbers from Bruce Schneier:
"One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)
Given that k = 1.38×10^-16 erg/°Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2°Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2°K would consume 4.4×10^-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.
Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21×10^41 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7×10^56 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2^192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.
But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 10^51 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space."

You can. BIP32+BIP39 allows you to salt your master seed with a password. If you use this option, the Trezor, PIN  (with device) or mnemonic (paper or device), and salt (password) is required to access your account. The best part about this setup is that you can have a 128+ bit mnemonic and then use multiple salts/passwords to secure different accounts. Just make sure you write down your salt/password as well! It would be wise to store the mnemonic and salt/password in different locations.
Edit for BIP39 addition.

I love you guys but I think this is another example of a poor way to market your device over clones.
For fighting bwallet, you can simply say, "The current iteration of this clone is not a 1:1 hardware reproduction and will not work with the official version of our firmware. Trezor recommends only running official firmware unless you're an expert in microcontroller security and programming."
Future clones will work with unmodified firmware. In that scenario, it would be trivial to download official firmware and verify the hash before flashing.
A better way to combat future 1:1 clones would to set aside a percentage of your profit and fund security audits. Let people know that they are helping to improve the security of their hardware by buying genuine hardware. You can also improve the security of your packaging and add additional ways to verify customers are getting genuine hardware.

I may have a copy somewhere. I'll take a look. That said, Armory is dead, just pull the latest version and load it via USB using a linux live cd. Export your keys in offline mode and import them into something like Electrum or Trezor.
Edit. I have the 0.90-beta_OfflineBundle for 12.04 64 bit. Let me know if you need it. I have all of the checksum info as well but you should obviously verify the checksum/signing keys are valid from another source.

1. has admitted that using bits of proof was a mistake and that they will be moving away from it soon.
2. You can actually host mytrezor on your local machine. It just isn't user friendly at the moment to do so.
3. Try getting the "offline" wallet functionality from Electrum or Armory. If we're being honest, it is a pain in the ass.

IMO, if the ETF happens, big players (really big) have agreed to profit from bitcoin. The NYSE investment in Coinbase was a strong signal that the ETF or something like it might actually be approved.

With Mt. Gox being the only major fiat exchange at the time, it doesn't surprise me that he was a suspect. The defense recognized that their statement was a huge opportunity and will milk it for the rest of the trial. 
Ross is DPR. Being logged into the "mastermind" admin page is one thing, having your pidgin avatar set as a DPR silhouette is another... we also have the journal, the bitcoin amount, the philosophy, etc. It is the govt's case to lose; however, if the defense plays their Karpeles hand long enough, Ross might actually have a shot given the technical incompetence of the jury.

There will always be ways to bypass/extract information from hardware. Proprietary hardware can slow things down but I don't think code secrecy is the answer ([PS3 Glitching]( The PIN buys you time to transfer your coins to a new device or address should it ever be lost/stolen. Using a password protected Trezor prevents loss of coins in the event of a PIN exploit.
I still think the boards should have epoxy on them to buy a few more hours in the event of a theft.

The -r switch means you want to use a password/salt in the future. The -p switch is to enable PIN protection. You can change the pin anytime using: $./cmdtr.py change_pin
128 or 256 determines how many random words you want, 12 or 24.

This is incredibly shortsighted of SatoshiLabs. should have taken the position that imitation is flattery and used their name along with their open source approach to sell at a premium. Instead, they have alienated the original spirit of the project and done nothing to prevent Chinese knock-offs. 
As previous commenters suggested, it is only a matter of time until 1:1 clones are created in both look and functionality. Maintaining a loyal fan base and adding features that help to ensure their customers are in fact receiving genuine Trezors instead of clones are the steps that should have been taken.
Now that SatoshiLabs have turned their back on their original motivation for using a real open source license, they open the door for another form of competition: A truly open source fork of the original LGPLv3 codebase and a team that is dedicated to maintaining feature parity. This is possible if the new team never looks at any of SatoshiLabs MS-RSL code. I look forward to buying a new open source version of this device if SatoshiLabs fails to change their license back.
Edit 2: 
If you're a company that might be considering an open source fork of this project, it is incredibly important to stay as far away from the MS-RSL code base as possible.

As klokanx's link mentions, when using myTrezor, your xpub key is sent to their server. If you trust that myTrezor doesn't log information and you're comfortable with this privacy model, you can stop reading.
If you don't want to trust myTrezor, you can generate your xpub/xpriv key using the command line tool:  and only use Electrum 2.0. This limits information leaks to the addresses you are using and not all past/future addresses. You can also connect to an onion hosted electrum server to prevent the Electrum server from linking your IP to your addresses. If this privacy model is acceptable stop reading.
The next best privacy model would be obtained by hosting your own Electrum server as a hidden service and following the same steps outlined in the previous example.
Armory may introduce an even better privacy model with Trezor integration but I haven't kept up with everything they're planning.

Unless there is some crypto-voodoo that I've missed, it isn't a question of whether you allow it or not. I'm simply saying it will happen. Look at modchip clones, ecig clones, etc. If a cloner can write your firmware to a 1:1 hardware reproduction, there is nothing you can do to stop people from updating their device with your updated and signed firmware. If you add some type of account requirements to access firmware updates, those updates will simply be dumped and released with hashes to prove they are legit.
I don't have any specific ideas to share. I'm just saying that you are selling your brand, your integrity, and your commitment to improving the security of the software. Trying to prevent cloners is a waste of time; they will always capture a percentage of your market. Security vulnerabilities/bugs that lose coins on the other hand can kill your company overnight.

I think we're a long way away from seeing an attack like this. Attacks on web services/phones/PCs/etc are way easier to pull off than counterfeiting a Trezor.
Having said that... it would be nice to see future devices filled with epoxy and an option to allow users to verify their device_id by entering it into SatoshiLab's database. An attacker would then need to clone all aspects of the Trezor and recover a device_id from a legit Trezor (with epoxy) for every fraudulent one they make. If Trezor suggested reflashing the firmware after device_id verification, the hardware modifications and software exploits would require even more sophistication.
Edit: Securing the device ID would probably require a specialized chip that only outputs a hash of the programed device_id. This could all be done on the existing MCU but I'm guessing it would be simple to probe. Any hardware gods lurking around here?

This is one of my favorite Greg Maxwell facts: 
 -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
  This archive contains 18,592 scientific publications totaling
33GiB, all from Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society
and which should be  available to everyone at no cost, but most
have previously only been made available at high prices through
paywall gatekeepers like JSTOR.
Limited access to the  documents here is typically sold for $19
USD per article, though some of the older ones are available as
cheaply as $8. Purchasing access to this collection one article
at a time would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Also included is the basic factual metadata allowing you to
locate works by title, author, or publication date, and a
checksum file to allow you to check for corruption.
ef8c02959e947d7f4e4699f399ade838431692d972661f145b782c2fa3ebcc6a sha256sum.txt
I've had these files for a long time, but I've been afraid that if I
published them I would be subject to unjust legal harassment by those who
profit from controlling access to these works.
I now feel that I've been making the wrong decision.
On July 19th 2011, Aaron Swartz was criminally charged by the US Attorney
General's office for, effectively, downloading too many academic papers
from JSTOR.
Academic publishing is an odd systemâ€”the authors are not paid for their
writing, nor are the peer reviewers (they're just more unpaid academics),
and in some fields even the journal editors are unpaid. Sometimes the
authors must even pay the publishers.
And yet scientific publications are some of the most outrageously
expensive pieces of literature you can buy. In the past, the high access
fees supported the costly mechanical reproduction of niche paper journals,
but online distribution has mostly made this function obsolete.
As far as I can tell, the money paid for access today serves little
significant purpose except to perpetuate dead business models. The
"publish or perish" pressure in academia gives the authors an impossibly
weak negotiating position, and the existing system has enormous inertia.
Those with the most power to change the system--the long-tenured luminary
scholars whose works give legitimacy and prestige to the journals, rather
than the other way around--are the least impacted by its failures. They
are supported by institutions who invisibly provide access to all of the
resources they need. And as the journals depend on them, they may ask
for alterations to the standard contract without risking their career on
the loss of a publication offer. Many don't even realize the extent to
which academic work is inaccessible to the general public, nor do they
realize what sort of work is being done outside universities that would
benefit by it.
Large publishers are now able to purchase the political clout needed
to abuse the narrow commercial scope of copyright protection, extending
it to completely inapplicable areas: slavish reproductions of historic
documents and art, for example, and exploiting the labors of unpaid
scientists. They're even able to make the taxpayers pay for their
attacks on free society by pursuing criminal prosecution (copyright has
classically been a civil matter) and by burdening public institutions
with outrageous subscription fees.
Copyright is a legal fiction representing a narrow compromise: we give
up some of our natural right to exchange information in exchange for
creating an economic incentive to author, so that we may all enjoy more
works. When publishers abuse the system to prop up their existence,
when they misrepresent the extent of copyright coverage, when they use
threats of frivolous litigation to suppress the dissemination of publicly
owned works, they are stealing from everyone else.
Several years ago I came into possession, through rather boring and
lawful means, of a large collection of JSTOR documents.
These particular documents are the historic back archives of the
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Societyâ€”a prestigious scientific
journal with a history extending back to the 1600s.
The portion of the collection included in this archive, ones published
prior to 1923 and therefore obviously in the public domain, total some
18,592 papers and 33 gigabytes of data.
The documents are part of the shared heritage of all mankind,
and are rightfully in the public domain, but they are not available
freely. Instead the articles are available at $19 each--for one month's
viewing, by one person, on one computer. It's a steal. From you.
When I received these documents I had grand plans of uploading them to
Wikipedia's sister site for reference works, Wikisourceâ€” where they
could be tightly interlinked with Wikipedia, providing interesting
historical context to the encyclopedia articles. For example, Uranus
was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel; why not take a look at
the paper where he originally disclosed his discovery? (Or one of the
several follow on publications about its satellites, or the dozens of
other papers he authored?)
But I soon found the reality of the situation to be less than appealing:
publishing the documents freely was likely to bring frivolous litigation
from the publishers.
As in many other cases, I could expect them to claim that their slavish
reproductionâ€”scanning the documentsâ€” created a new copyright
interest. Or that distributing the documents complete with the trivial
watermarks they added constituted unlawful copying of that mark. They
might even pursue strawman criminal charges claiming that whoever obtained
the files must have violated some kind of anti-hacking laws.
In my discreet inquiry, I was unable to find anyone willing to cover
the potentially unbounded legal costs I risked, even though the only
unlawful action here is the fraudulent misuse of copyright by JSTOR and
the Royal Society to withhold access from the public to that which is
legally and morally everyone's property.
In the meantime, and to great fanfare as part of their 350th anniversary,
the RSOL opened up "free" access to their historic archivesâ€”but "free"
only meant "with many odious terms", and access was limited to about
100 articles.
All too often journals, galleries, and museums are becoming not
disseminators of knowledgeâ€”as their lofty mission statements
suggestâ€”but censors of knowledge, because censoring is the one thing
they do better than the Internet does. Stewardship and curation are
valuable functions, but their value is negative when there is only one
steward and one curator, whose judgment reigns supreme as the final word
on what everyone else sees and knows. If their recommendations have value
they can be heeded without the coercive abuse of copyright to silence 
The liberal dissemination of knowledge is essential to scientific
inquiry. More than in any other area, the application of restrictive
copyright is inappropriate for academic works: there is no sticky question
of how to pay authors or reviewers, as the publishers are already not
paying them. And unlike 'mere' works of entertainment, liberal access
to scientific work impacts the well-being of all mankind. Our continued
survival may even depend on it.
If I can remove even one dollar of ill-gained income from a poisonous
industry which acts to suppress scientific and historic understanding,
then whatever personal cost I suffer will be justifiedâ€”it will be one
less dollar spent in the war against knowledge. One less dollar spent
lobbying for laws that make downloading too many scientific papers
a crime.
I had considered releasing this collection anonymously, but others pointed
out that the obviously overzealous prosecutors of Aaron Swartz would
probably accuse him of it and add it to their growing list of ridiculous
charges. This didn't sit well with my conscience, and I generally believe
that anything worth doing is worth attaching your name to.
I'm interested in hearing about any enjoyable discoveries or even useful
applications which come of this archive.

 "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." -Peter Schiff
Joke's aside, Peter's only argument for why gold has value is because gold has history and is used for other things (electronics, fillings, etc.), hence it has intrinsic value. The fact is the majority of gold's value comes from the "perception" that it is a good store of value. Until Peter can admit that this is the case, arguing with him about bitcoin is futile.

2. Coin tracking past the first hop. While not confirmed, I suspect they are doing it and it is flawed for obvious reasons.
3. Shitcoin integration. Coinbase pushed ethereum without really understanding the or caring about the flaws. This transitions nicely to my fourth gripe...

If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.
Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.
I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.

Your frustration with SatoshiLabs not taking sidechannel attacks seriously is well documented but is there anything on the market that does better in terms of preventing coin loss? To a layperson, the Trezor design seems far less likely to lose coins than alternative solutions for a few important reasons:
1. Ease of use. I've used paper wallets and Armory offline wallets; it isn't an experience I care to repeat.
2. BIP32. Unless someone has a really good reason to avoid deterministic  wallets, I'm never looking back.
3. Smaller attack surface. I stay pretty current on code changes to both Armory and Electrum and some of the mistakes/bug fixes I see would keep me up at night. Trezor code looks fairly clean, small, and is mostly straightforward.
4. "Offline" signing.
5. It actually exists.

You won't find a better summary than Matthew Green's:
"I’m going to skip most of the details, not because it isn’t interesting, but rather because I’d like to focus on what I think is the most intriguing hypotheses in the paper. Namely, that the NSA isn’t worried about quantum computers at all, but rather, that they’ve made a major advance in classical cryptanalysis of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem — and panic is the result."
" By calculating the number of possible curve families, Koblitz and Menezes show that a vast proportion of curves (for P-256, around 2^{209} out of 2^{257}) would have to be weak in order for the NSA to succeed in this attack. The implications of such a large class of vulnerable curves is very bad for the field of ECC. It dwarfs every previous known weak curve class and would call into question the decision to use ECC at all.
In other words, Koblitz and Menezes are saying that if you accept the weak curve hypothesis into your heart, the solution is not to replace the NIST elliptic curves with anything at all, but rather, to leave the building as rapidly as possible and perhaps not shut the door on the way out. No joke.
On the gripping hand, this sounds very much like the plan NSA is currently implementing. Perhaps we should be worried."

If sidechains use blinding for redemption, a user could always claim the source of his coins was mining.

From the link you posted:
"If the NSA succeeds in developing a cryptologically useful quantum computer, ECDSA would fall while SHA-256 and RIPEMD160 would remain secure."
Which is why I made the statement about change addresses:
"However, you do have to broadcast your public key to the network to make a transaction, otherwise there is no way to verify your signature. What this implies is that in the face of an NSA quantum computer all Bitcoin addresses would have to be considered one-time use addresses. Whenever you make a transaction you would have to send any excess bitcoin to a newly generated address as “change”. If you didn’t remove the entire balance from your address, the NSA could steal the remainder."

Sure, adding a custom word would would increase the possible combinations, but why bother?
A 24 char password consisting of upper, lower, numbers, and special chars will give you about 128 bits of entropy.
A keyboard only has about 92 possible chars (that you would use). See:  A word list has 2048:  Just think of the word list as an expanded keyboard.
Trezor has an option to use a password as well. You can think of this as your custom word.

"The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.
By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions." - Satoshi

Sure, they could do that but why would they? There is no need for distributed trust in that model. Fedcoin can just run the servers like Ripple. While we're on that subject, why bother with Ripple code at all? Just use a database. It works just fine for USD/Visacoin.

The most interesting part of the interview was the news that federated chains from private parties are already running in their lab and that POC code will be publicly released in 2-3 months. It would make a lot of sense if one of the private parties is Zerocoin/Zerocash as it is a perfect candidate for a POC sidechain:
1. The federated chain currently requires trust in the issuer which isn't a huge deal in this case because Zerocash also requires trust in the form of an RSA modulus
2. The coins only need to move into Zerocash sidechain and sit for a brief period of time before moving out
3. bitcoin is now fungible with the help of sidechains

1.	During the early days of Bitcoin, Satoshi kept the system running with only a handful of enthusiasts. Sergio Demian Lerner estimates Satoshi’s bitcoin holdings at about 1 million BTC from mining during this time period ( Almost none of these coins have ever moved from their original addresses. I suggest that someone who has managed to remain anonymous, spent years researching and developing Bitcoin, and has access to almost a billion USD worth of Bitcoin has a vested interest in its success. The beauty of Bitcoin is that everyone who holds it has a vested interest in seeing it succeed. The larger the network grows, the more secure it becomes; this applies to code review and transactional security via increased hashing power. Should a flaw be found in the code, the value would almost certainly crash… for a moment. Everyone would agree that the flaw should be patched and all miners (securing transactions) would update their software to the newest version of code. This has happened in the past.
2.	Almost all altcoins fail to make major improvements to the Bitcoin protocol. In fact, many of them have made decisions that weaken the security Bitcoin offers ( It should be understood that Bitcoin is consensus driven software. Any improvements to an altcoin can be tested, peer reviewed, and then implemented in Bitcoin. Only the ledger with values needs to remain static. Ripple will most likely fail because it is premined, centralized, and has no model for fair coin distribution. Most of us consider it a scam that is trying to fake it until it makes it. Many altcoins can be tossed into this same bucket.
3.	Bitcointalk and the Bitcoin subreddit are the best places for Bitcoin dialog. For pricing, I prefer  and  I follow prices on Bitstamp, Mt Gox, and BTC China.

The current dollar cost to secure the network at 10 PH/s using 28nm ASICs is about the same as the cost to employee 400 workers making $50,000 a year. I suspect the advantages of Bitcoin can eventually obsolete far more than 400 jobs.
If you want to talk power consumption, you should compare Bitcoin to what it takes to power the world's datacenters: 30 billion watts ( You don't see too many people complaining about that power consumption.
Also, should Bitcoin chip away at golds use as a store of value, Krugman can sleep soundly knowing that less  "human rights abuses (rapes, beatings and killings by security personnel) and environmental damage (vast quantities of potentially toxic tailings dumped into a nearby river)" are occurring as a result.

Almost all of the other altcoins offer little to no advantages over Bitcoin. The only exception to this may be the unreleased version of Zerocoin (not libzerocoin) which offers built in mixing at the expense of larger transaction sizes and more complicated cryptography. Even if Zerocoin takes off, the code, or something like it, could always be added to Bitcoin with a hard fork or extension like CoinJoin. If Bitcoin fails to compete and another coin's developers actually know what they are doing, that coin will win and we'll all be better off because of it. Until then, the best comparison for altcoins would be pump and dump penny stocks.

"Maybe Nakamoto's end game is to destroy Bitcoin so that another, more perfect instrument can take over the global economy.
Or maybe not. Perhaps he just wants to be rich, a scenario that both Varoufakis and Guomundsson think is as unlikely as it would be catastrophic to the Bitcoin.
Nakamoto is either a much smarter person than we give him credit for, or he's just another clumsy thief."
I'd like to propose something far more sinister. Maybe he just wanted to change the way money works? You know, like he said in his whitepaper?
This isn't a video game and the economy doesn't work like  TF2, EVE, or Second Life. The argument that Bitcoin is a bubble is a foolish one!

"A recent study from Microsoft Research showed that while the median time to receive a block is 6.5 seconds, after 40 seconds there are still 5% of nodes that have not yet received a block. This means that even five minute block times are still comfortably greater than required, but the comfort margin is thinning. You can see the real-life, non-impact of this by observing how there have not been any orphaned chains with more than a single block since March. If block propagation were an issue then there would be significantly longer orphaned chains as confusion persists regarding which blocks arrived first.
Given this reality, one might question the value of 10-minute planned block times, as many alt-coins already have. While there is certainly a case to be made for decreased confirmation periods, there are a number of reasons 10 minutes is unlikely to change."
The reality only solidifies the need for a 10-minute confirmation time. Knowing that exponential mining growth can half the confirmation time for blocks, we can assume that, should litecoin take off, confirmation time could dip to around 70 seconds. This time is very close to Microsoft's 40+ second time required for 5% of nodes. One also should assume an increasing number of 3rd world users will increase the time required for full transaction propagation. The statement that "While there is certainly a case to be made for decreased confirmation periods," seems at odds with the rest of the article.

I think if the developers provided a little history on the current state of webmail, they would get more support.
There are currently only four options for users wanting to run a serious self-hosted webmail solution. Squirrelmail, Roundcube, Zimbra, and Horde. With the exception of Horde, none of these clients were built with privacy in mind. Arguably, none of these webmail packages are focused on single user deployments/self hosting.
If you can ignore the 1990's web interface ( Squirrelmail's GPG plugin was last updated in 2007 and AFAIK still has no working implementation for the latest release of SM. S/MIME is working with the addition of a plugin.
The Roundcube community has talked about supporting P/GPG for 7 years. The site has listed "Support for PGP and S/MIME encryption" under the planned features section since September of 2009. Someone finally released a plugin for GPG a few months ago:  
No support for P/GPG or S/MIME.
Native support for both S/MIME and GPG

Here is the best low level description I've found:
"The key idea in Zerocoin is that each coin commits to (read: encrypts) a random serial number. These coins are easy to create -- all you need to do is pick the serial number and run a fast commitment algorithm to wrap this up in a coin. The commitment works like encryption, in that the resulting coin completely hides the serial number . At the same time this coin 'binds' you to the number you've chosen. The serial number is secret, and it stays with you.
To 'Mint' the new coin you post it to the network along with a standard Bitcoin transaction containing enough (normal) bitcoins to 'pay for' it. The Mint transaction adds some new messages to the Bitcoin protocol, but fundamentally there's no magic here. The Bitcoin network will accept the transaction into the block chain as long as the input bitcoins check out.**
The Zerocoin 'Spend' transaction is a little bit more complicated. To redeem your zerocoin, you first create a new transaction that contains the coin's serial number (remember that you kept it secret after you made the coin). You also attach a zero-knowledge proof of the following two statements:
    You previously posted a valid zerocoin on the block chain.
    This particular zerocoin contained the serial number you put in your transaction.
The key to making this all work is that zero-knowledge proof. What you need to know about these is that anyone can verify such a proof, and she'll be absolutely convinced that you're telling the truth about these statements. At the same time, the proof reveals absolutely no other information (hence the 'zero' knowledge).
This means anyone who sees your Spend transaction will be convinced that you really did previously Mint a zerocoin, and that it contained the serial number you just revealed. They can then check the block chain to make sure that particular serial number has never been Spent before. At the same time, the zero knowledge property ensures that they they have absolutely no idea which zerocoin you're actually spending. The number of such coins could easily run into the millions.
All of this leads us to one final question: where do your bitcoins go after you Mint a zerocoin, and how do you get them back when you Spend? 
The simple answer is that they don't go anywhere at all. The bitcoins used in a 'Mint' transaction just sit there on the block chain. The Zerocoin protocol semantics require that nobody can access those coins again except by publishing a valid Zerocoin 'Spend'. When you publish a Spend, the protocol allows you to 'claim' any of the previously-committed bitcoins -- regardless of who posted them. In other words, you Mint with one set of bitcoins, and you leave with someone else's. "

It won't be easy, but the goal isn't that unreachable. Assuming a plug and play "activist miner" existed (1TH/s for the price of a mid-range video card), it would only take 1/8th of this subreddit's subscribers to equal power of the entire network.

Ironkey is one of the few thumb drives using legitimate hardware encryption. Coupled with the built in wallet encryption, you're about as safe as you get ...until you use it in a PC that is online or will be online in the future. Use Armory until clients support devices like Trezor and your only weak link is your brain's ability to remember passwords.

From Paul Bohm:
Bitcoin is a theoretical and practical breakthrough that makes it possible to decentralize services we couldn't previously decentralize.
To elaborate: Bitcoin isn't just a currency but an elegant universal solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem[1], one of the core problems of reaching consensus in Distributed Systems. Until recently it was thought to not be practically solvable at all, much less on a global scale. Irrespective of its currency aspects, many experts believe Bitcoin is brilliant in that it technically made possible what was previously thought impossible.
The Byzantine Generals' Problem roughly goes as follows: N Generals have their armies camped outside a city they want to invade. They know their numbers are strong enough that if at least 1/2 of them attack at the same time they'll be victorious. But if they don't coordinate the time of attack, they'll be spread too thin and all die. They also suspect that some of the Generals might be disloyal and send fake messages. Since they can only communicate by messenger, they have no means to verify the authenticity of a message. How can such a large group reach consensus on the time of attack without trust or a central authority, especially when faced with adversaries intent on confusing them?
Bitcoin's solution is this: All of the Generals start working on a mathematical problem that statistically should take 10 minutes to solve if all of them worked on it. Once one of them finds the solution, she broadcasts that solution to all the other Generals. Everyone then proceeds to extending that solution - which again should take another ten minutes. Every General always starts working on extending the longest solution he's seen. After a solution has been extended 12 times, every General can be certain that no attacker controlling less than half the computational resources could have created another chain of similar length. The existence of the 12-block chain is proof that a majority of them has participated in its creation. We call this a proof-of-work scheme.
If that sounds confusing, don't worry. What it means is just that consensus is reached, because computational resources are scarce. You vote with work. To rig the vote an attacker would need to control more computational power than the honest nodes. To ensure it's more expensive for an attacker to purchase the computational power needed to attack the system, Bitcoin adds an incentive scheme. Users who contribute computational power get rewarded for their work. If the value of a Bitcoin rises and thus attacking the system becomes more profitable, it also becomes more profitable for honest users to add computational resources. At any given point, one would expect miners to invest as much resources into mining as is profitable for them. Bitcoin is a currency, because it needs incentives to protect the consensus process from attackers. This computational process ("mining") is not wasteful at all, but an incredibly efficient way to make attacks economically unprofitable. Bitcoin never uses more computational resources than neccessary to protect the integrity of its interactions.
Now let's go back to discussing the value provided by Bitcoin. Essentially it's a means to make consensus in highly distributed large-scale systems, which would otherwise never be able to reach consensus. The value of this is, that it's now possible to build applications in a decentralized fashion, that we previously thought could not be built without a central authority. The most obvious value of Bitcoin is as a medium of exchange for goods and services that can't be easily bought or sold using cash issued by a central authority. But there's more. Bitcoin also makes it possible to fully decentralize the DNS (Domain Name System). In that case, every Bitcoin Domain Name already comes with a cryptographic key pair. That means it also allows us to solve the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) problem - every name you connect to has an encryption key associated with it that can be verified without trusting a central authority. In case network traffic monitoring prevents people from accessing information either at all or anonymously, Bitcoin makes it feasible to pay for internet relays that anonymize or reroute traffic - that is, it makes it easier to remove central control and fight censorship. The list goes on, I've been hard-pressed to find any decentralization schemes that would not benefit from Bitcoin integration
The pattern here is: Pretty much all of these applications can already be built in centralized form. But often the centralized solution comes with a whole bunch of weaknesses. In the PKI case you'll have to trust over 300 Certificate Authorities every time you make an https:// connection, many of which are located in countries with repressive governments. If any of those 300 entities get compromised or malevolent attackers will be able to read your email, access your bank account, and violate your privacy. DNS is getting censored by governments because they can. And every time you store value in currency, you're trusting a central authority that it isn't mismanaged and thus depreciates in value.
Is there value in Bitcoin? Let me ask a counter question: Is decentralization valuable? If you think that we'll increasingly lose trust in the central authorities that manage the infrastructure we rely on, you might expect Bitcoins to rise a lot in value. If not, that is you believe that authorities will be able to tackle the challenges of the future better in centralized form, then from your perspective Bitcoins don't add value. We'll see.
[1]  (
From Satoshi Nakamoto:
The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem.  I'll 
try to rephrase it in that context.
A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the 
King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain 
number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a 
packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and 
erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  They 
only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack 
at the same time.
They don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree. 
 It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and 
whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is 
that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different 
attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear 
the other first.
They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem.  Once each general 
receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an 
extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its 
hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of 
them all working at once before one of them finds a solution.  Once one of the 
generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone 
changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work 
in the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack 
time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.
After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 
proofs-of-work.  Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the 
proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was 
expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers 
to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.  They had to all have 
seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU 
power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, 
they can safely attack at the agreed time.
The proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed database 
and global view problems you've asked about are solved.

*1 -Andreas is scheduled with Amir Taaki, who is working on a current implementation of CoinJoin*
Awesome! I'd also love to hear questions about Amir's political views and day to day life. LTB seems like a great platform for discussing some of his more radical views that fail to translate on short TV interviews.
*2 - I have an interview with Alan on Monday about Armory, we've been waiting for their funding to complete.*
Alan is another interesting person. I'd love to know more about his life before Bitcoin.
*3 - That's a good idea*
*4 - I don't know what this is, why should I care?*
Conformal is reimplementing Bitcoin in Google's go. Some details here: 
Code: 
I think knowing the background and motivation for people like this is fascinating. It takes a special person to devote this much time into rebuilding Bitcoin from scratch. Amir is another person working on a very similar project.
*5 - We actually try not to put too much of our own projects into the show, we just talked about his book recently is there something specific you would want to know?*
I can appreciate that. Still, the first real book on Bitcoin is a pretty big deal and another huge undertaking that requires an insane amount of commitment. I'd love to hear more about the process.
*6 - Andreas has two on order, we were waiting to see hardware before pulling in the participants but we did talk about hardware wallets briefly in the upcoming episode I think next Tuesday*
Great! I'm very excited about the hardware and the almost altruistic nature of guys like slush and Alan.
*7 - Glad you liked it, I'm waiting for an article from Sneak for the blog and intend to use that as the excuse to interview him again. I love the warrior philosopher poet thing some black hats have going on.*
I'm not surprise you have most of these bases covered. Still, you don't need excuses to chat with many of these guys. I think a lot of the Bitcoin community could listen to them talk for hours on end. =) 
*8 - We're supposed to do the interview in September but it's been hard to schedule.*
Dan is another person that could create hours of interesting content. I was a huge fan of his early criticisms of Bitcoin even though I disagreed with him.
*9 - Is Sipa a person or a project?*
Sorry. Sipa is Pieter Wuille, the core developer behind many of improvements Bitcoin has seen
*10 - The % of their total business in Bitcoin? Sure, that sounds plausible for an interview*
I should expand on that by saying that I agree in some ways with TechCrunch's headline of "Your Bitcoins Are Finally Worth Something." with regard to Gyft. The product seems like a huge deal to me. Some other questions could obviously be about how Gyft got started, the difficulty getting shops to accept payment for cards through the Gyft network, future plans like buying cards for a specific amount, etc.
*11 - We just had Gavin on like three weeks ago, I like to put some distance between appearances - Anything specific you think Gavin should be weighing in about?*
I don't think anyone would be upset with you for including additional content from anyone who has decided to make Bitcoin their full time job. This includes content about you; I loved your speech at the Bitcoin 2013 conference. I do however find myself getting quite pissed about the time I feel is wasted talking about the merits of altcoins. I can appreciate content from people that are trying new things like Sunnyking but that interview with Peter Manglaviti on feathercoin was cringe worthy...
*12 - Why? What exactly do you want to know from Coinbase? I use their service and don't have many questions, seems like a straightforward and infrastructure level service with the big innovation being their relationships that allow connections to bank accounts.*
I'd love to know more about their security model and the whitehat program:  I'd also like to know their thoughts on the situation with MtGox, the transition to buying from Bitstamp, etc. It seems like their unavoidable requirement to sell bitcoins on an exchange is the Achilles heel of a fantastic service. I'm also sure they are a goldmine of compliance information for anyone interesting in starting a Bitcoin business.
*13 - I have a 10 minute interview with Sam from KNC miner running in the next one or two shows*
*14 - I know Stephanie wants to catch up with Mike Hearn again, good idea.*
*15 - I have a 50 minute show he did with Stephanie and Davi of BitcoinNotBombs that we'll be running at some point, the context of it was Satoshi Forest.*
Thanks again!
*16 - Amusingly, I don't feel that strongly about this and I don't think any of the other hosts do either. I've been wanting to incorporate more interactive debates into the actual show since we did that one for the foundation, this might be a good opportunity to do so. Can you suggest some outspoken voices on either side of the issue? It won't happen until mid october but I think a debate about the blocksize issue could be useful.*
I'd suggest Peter Todd who created the video at:  as one of the leading proponents of a fixed blocksize. Gavin is currently in the process of drafting a whitepaper on why it needs to change. Jeff Garzik says it best at:  "Block size is a core economic resource, like the number of bitcoins itself. Not merely the number of transactions we can support... it influences fees and many other factors."*
*17 - Good idea, haven't spoken with him since the conference.*
Thanks, his speech at the Bitcoin 2013 conference was great as well! 
*18 - Don't we do that frequently? Do you mean more formal? I guess we could have an Austrian and a Keynesian in a live debate format or something.*
I see this as another hot topic with interesting perspectives from both fans and critics. I'd love to see Jon Matonis take on anyone in a format similar to this: 
*19 - I'm sitting down with Jeffrey the day after CCC in Atlanta, good topics I'm planning it to be wide-ranging.*
*20 - The altcoin topic is tough, if we bitch about them people complain, if we say nice things about them people complain. We've had that exact conversation before, and have one on an upcoming show asking what our criteria should be for accepting new altcoins for donation since we do get asked fairly often by people wanting to donate in something we don't accept.*
The incentive structure of Bitcoin is duplicated as soon as someone changes two lines of code for their altcoin. A vocal minority will always want you to accept their altcoin because they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by increased adoption. This actually devalues Bitcoin. It also devalues Litecoin if you want to look at it that way.
*4 - I'm doing an in-person interview with Rob from Gliph on Thursday after speaking at the C2SV conference*
Thanks, I'd love to know what type of market Gliph is trying to capture.
Thanks for taking the time to reply!

Scrypt does nothing to prevent mining consolidation. Any proof of work based system will always mean that money is work. If you want to do something to prevent consolidation, push the concept of "activist mining" (mining on p2pool to support the network and not necessarily mining for profit) to anyone that cares enough to listen. With SHA256 ASICs now pushing against Moore's Law, we should see cheap TH/s+ plug and play hardware out of China that any activist can plug in and instantly support the network.

Bitcoin goes mainstream by Timothy B. Lee December 31 at 2:26 pm
The rise of Bitcoin is also a story of rule-breaking. Bitcoin was explicitly created to undermine the power of the conventional banking establishment. And the network's unorthodox structure makes it an uneasy fit for conventional financial regulations.
U.S. law implicitly assumes that each financial network is operated by a company or other institution that can enforce financial regulations, including those designed to fight money laundering. Congress never imagined the possibility of a completely decentralized financial network. So at the start of 2013, it was unclear how the law would apply to this innovation in payment technology.
Bitcoin rejected other key assumptions of the conventional financial industry, too. Older financial networks are based on conventional currencies such as the dollar. Bitcoin uses its own currency. Conventional financial networks give consumers mechanisms for reversing fraudulent transactions. On the Bitcoin network, transactions are irreversible. If someone steals your bitcoins, you are out of luck.
It didn't help the network's reputation that one of the most-discussed applications for the virtual currency was the online drug bazaar Silk Road. Unsurprisingly, most people dismissed Bitcoin as impractical, or worse.
But everything changed in 2013. The currency's price rose from around $13 at the start of the year to $1,200 by the end of November (it's now around $800). As Bitcoin's price soared, it got an avalanche of press coverage.
That forced influential people who dismissed the currency initially to give it a second look. Investors started to take notice. Bitcoin startups announced a series of fundraising successes, culminating in Coinbase's $25 million fundraising round earlier this month. Policymakers, too, began taking the currency seriously. A pair of November Senate hearings were Bitcoin lovefests, with federal regulators stressing their commitment not to hamper development of the fledgling payment network.
Bitcoin's decentralized structure was essential to winning the blessing of regulators. If there were a Bitcoin Inc. that owned the network, federal regulators would likely have demanded that it make changes to facilitate enforcement of federal regulations, and shut it down if it didn't comply. But the Bitcoin community pointed out that no one had the authority to change the Bitcoin network. They argued that excessive regulation would simply push Bitcoin-related commerce overseas, where U.S. regulators would have even less influence. The gambit worked. Regulators interpreted U.S. law in a way that's relatively hospitable to the development of Bitcoin-based businesses on American soil."
