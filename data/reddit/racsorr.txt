Yes, an honest way to put it. I hope as many people as possible can be aware of this- to sell BCH while money can be made and while it's not too late. Price will soon drop, and now is the time to make some money if you have BCH on exchange.

Yes, agree. I just checked GDAX, and there's a huge red block of BCH waiting to be sold. It's not even moving. Seems like shady business to me.

Yes, sir

Everyone on this thread will tell you "it's never too late to invest in bitcoin". Basically, what I am saying is that you should take information with a grain of salt. And you should be aware that investing in bitcoin is high risk/high reward. Sooner or later you will learn to invest, but even the best can't predict the market with a precision of 100%.

It has been a pleasure, guys

So you're saying that you should only use Coinbase for purchases and then send the BTC to a GDAX address where you can withdraw in local currency for example?
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:58:24
I see. I have looked into GDAX a lot actually. But, I don't know if I can pay with a credit card (VISA) there as it doesn't say that it's a legitimate payment method. I am waiting for a dip (and my paycheck) to buy BTC and I think I can save money on an instant transaction if I manage to buy low, instead of having a bank transfer over many days as I have seen many complications regarding that (not getting the buy correct)

Just you

What are the main differences between Coinbase and GDAX? I have 0,0270 BTC (Not very much, I know. However, I bought for the first time yesterday) stored on a Coinbase wallet behind a two-part authenticator. How should I proceed if I'd like to just hold?

All aboard!

Coinbase is out of favor with me because I don't see it as a safe place to HODL BTC, but rather a place for buying your first BTC and learning the basics. In addition, you're onto it - it's the sky-high fees that bother me.

I edited my comment while you commented, so there might be some information you didn't read.
As for your new comment, you should buy from trustworthy sites and/or people with low fees.
You should buy low and sell high, which is easier said than done. You should also buy in bulk to reduce fees.

Cool, and yes it does, but many people buy on the rise, and also save some in case of a dip. Good luck!
