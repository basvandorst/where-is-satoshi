This is a no brainer.  The real question is, at what price will bitcoin be at when that occurs.
When the block reward halved in November of 2012, prices were at ~$13.  One year later they were at ~$1200 (a 9000%+ increase).  It will be interesting, no doubt.

You're living in a fantasy world.  What the Fed, and all central banks for that matter, have embarked upon with QE is unprecedented in modern financial history.  Even just low interest rate policy has been the cause of every major bubble cycle for the past three decades, much less outright asset purchases and ZIRP.
This is not even mentioning the trillions in off-balance sheet derivatives that could take down the entire economy if even one big institution gets in trouble (ring a bell?  Lehman).  See margin debt lately (ATH)?  How about the 10yr yield at 2.60 with S&amp;P near ATH's?  How about the US dollar breaking support yesterday and heading lower?
Time to wake up...

This is Schiff argument, and I think it is incorrect.  Bitcoin is inherently useful as a more efficient means of transferring value across the globe. Also, the blockchain as a global asset register seems pretty useful to me.

Typically I would agree with you, but in this case none of the other panelists (or any pundits on CNBC) give bitcoin a chance other than BK.
When they are doing the eight-window interviews at the beginning of the second hour of Closing Bell and all of then agree that bitcoin is a long term buy, then I will concur.
Plus, bitcoin is not a stock.  I have been analyzing and trading stocks professionally for years as well, and this is not a contrarian indicator in this instance (yet).
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:05:04
Yep, referring to BitsharesX.  Why should this coin have value, and why are there so many pumpers on trollboxes? The one question no proponent has been able to answer is what advantage does this provide over simply doing this over the bitcoin blockchain w/ something like OT, which is probably more flexible anyway?  Isn't one of the promises of bitcoin as a decentralized asset register exactly what BitsharesX is trying to do?  I say, lets use bitcoin.
As far as OT, I have talked to Chris in the past six months. They (Monetas) moved shop to Switzerland and are as active in dev as ever.  They are trying to build an institutional-grade reference platform for the next generation asset markets.  Give em some time ;)  
On that note, I think there is alot happeneing in the crypto space under the radar that will not come to light until it is financially beneficial for those involved.  IMO, there will be another BTC bubble, and it will be the biggest yet, but it MIGHT not happen for 2 or 3 years...

From his "About" page:
"My own view is that monetary policy has been too tight for the past three years"
If you read the whole thing, you'll see that this guy is a keynesian on steroids.  His argument is completely ridiculous.  It relies on the assumption that the only reason bitcoin has utility is because of its expected higher future value.  He obviously doesn't "get it", nor would I expect him to given his political and economic views.

If you are referring to what you just wrote, then yes.
Get out of your shortsighted, myopic view of the market and look at it like an instiutional investor would.  If you look at the daily chart, there is no question these "spikes of large holders dumping" you refer to is anything but.  This is bush league.
Most successful investors buy when hype (ie volume and price action) is troughing at the latter stages of a cycle knowing that markets are never unidirectional.  There will be a pop at some point, the job of the investor is to properly weigh risk and reward based on the individuals trading metrics and risk tolerance.

As far as PoW, that is one of the reasons I like bitcoin!  It makes the "work" of mining actual work.  Also, calling it a waste of resources and an environmental disaster is FUD, pure and simple.  Do you have any idea how much of a disaster the current system is in terms of resource usage?!

It's Wall Street parlance.  A "bull" is long the market and therefore wants the market to go up (whatever the market may be), and a "bear" is short the market and wants it to go down.  So in this case bullish should be interpreted as positive if you own bitcoins, and negative if you are short or don't.

The blockchain is the technology, not the coins themselves.  There have been digital tokens and coins for decades that all failed because there was no such thing as the blockchain.
Also, when talking about protocols and networks, first mover advantage and hence the network effect produced by it are likely to make some version of bitcoin the ultimate winner, if there is one.  
Additionally, check out all the "sidechains" talk on the front page of right now.  This might make the altcoin market significantly less competitive in the near future.

There are plenty of independent financial advisors that know full well what is going on, what the outcome will be, and how to protect their clients.  Main thing, don't get within 500ft of a large institution, ie bank, pension fund, large hedge fund, PE.  The bigger they are, the more pressure there is to conform to the norms of the industry.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:27:21
Wow, I really hope you are joking.  Please do more research next time.
1.)  The effect you discuss is more than offset by an ever growing merchant base that cashes out 99% of coins into fiat currency.  Also, miners are always bringing alot of supply to market due to the inflationary phase the bitcoin is in.  Additionally, I cash out coins ALL THE TIME.  This is not a big issue.
2.)  You can short bitcoin on margin at bitfinex.com.  They have millions of dollars of liquidty and a great reputation (recently passed an audit).  There are currently over $4.5mil in short positions on that platform alone.
With a market cap of ~$5bil and a global population that has barely heard mention of bitcoin, much less gotten involved, tells me that this is most certainly not a bubble.

You are correct, and I was out of line for making the assumption.
TA is a tool used by market behavioralists/phycologists as guides (not predictors) of the market.  Economics is taught as a hard science of math and models in academia, however true economics is the study of human decision, action, and sentiment.  Charts are the expression of this sentiment in real time, and can provide valuable insight into the behavior of markets in general.  Nothing is ever right 100% of the time (keep in mind you are making money at 50.0...01%), and this fact does not make something valueless.
Nothing will guarantee a profit in any trade, but there are many tools you can use to inform yourself enough to give you an edge if you have a certain tolerance for risk.
BTW, TA is used everyday all over the globe by every legit trading desk in any capacity, I promise you this.

Well said, sir, and I concur that the thought gymnastics can be daunting, especially philosophically.  However, as one with degrees in economics, political science, and finance in addition to executive level management and banking experience I personally believe we have never seen anything as economically sound as bitcoin (it's by no means perfect, but the best we've discovered so far, imho).  It is more aligned with the laws of nature and human nature than fiat money beyond question.
Great discussion btw.  Thanks for not being a troll.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:56:10
Getting pretty sick of post like these.  First, 24 hours is nothing, unless you are 16 years old.
Second, this has nothing to do with bitcoin.  Go try to buy more traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds and you are looking at 5 days AT LEAST to get your account setup, money transferred in, and receive the actual stock certificates.  Even buying gold and silver immediately is difficult because most brokers don't hold physical, they order what you want and you wait for weeks.
Don't get mad at bitcoin, get mad at your gov't and banks.  
BTW, bitcoin doesn't need you to buy in, it will be just fine despite your absence.

No prob.


Why do you think this?  It is not empirically true.  Look at the price of ASICM shares over the past three weeks while bitcoin has been rallying.  It has gone up substanially since the rally!  There is no causal relationship between the price of BTC in USD and the price of ASICM in BTC.  History shows a moderate positive correlation.


Why keep demand effects separate?  All inputs are relevant.  And i disagree with your premise.  This is already happening (market saturation) and ASICMiner continues to outperform all competitors.
I suppose that if you are strictly looking at it in terms of BTC, then it might take a little longer to breakeven, however a return of investment must include dividends and price appreciation.

@_date: 2013-04-18 01:29:00
Granted, however the fact the the transaction ratio has plummeted to all time lows during this extreme volatility CAN'T be a bad thing for the bitcoin economy.  
As far as your friends, they are truly speculating and will lose in the end.  They apparently already are if they are only selling them for goods and services when the price tumbles. Ever heard of buy low and sell high?  The truth of the matter is that those of us in this for the long haul don't care about getting rich (wouldn't complain, but not the intent of the endeavor).  We want to provide financial freedom and flexibility to people all over the world, especially to those who have traditionally been shut out.  Your friends want to attain personal wealth without real sacrifice (which never works in the long run).
To your last thought, I suppose we will agree to disagree.  I hold mostly bitcoins, some metals, and very little cash, even for spending.  I would prefer to not hold an asset that is guaranteed to lose value in the long run ($), despite any short term gyrations in a more fundamentally sound one. Just my .02btc.

Well, let me be more specific.  At the municipal level individual votes actually may have an impact on the final outcome (ie outcome determined by a single voters ballot).  However, mathematically speaking, the odds of one single vote determining the outcome of a state or national election are astronomical.  
Also, if we relied purely on a 'popular vote', then maybe your vote would matter slightly more, but because of the electoral college, it is irrelevant.
Now, this isn't to say that there isn't something personally satisfying civically about the act of voting, but don't delude yourself into thinking that you are actually 'making a difference'.
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:34:47

Bravo my friend.  I concur with every sentence of your post.  I have an economics degree and MBA from great schools and have A TON of ideas for startups.  Its just that I have been stuck at a dead end corporate job for two years now that sucked up all my time and energy from me, and lo and behold I get let go today due to my lack of 'focus and passion'.  6 weeks paid severance and some bonus cash and, adios. Not bad, and it gives me a chance to start something great (whether directly or indirectly ClearMoody).  Let's all join together.  This is getting serious now.  
All that being said, I am sincerely look forward to your papers ClearMoody. I hope these discussions bring about some great ideas and collaborations.  I know I'll be involved!

Another thing is that central bankers have pretty much convinced market participants that they can manage the economy towards sustainable growth, hence the 'safety trade' (eg gold, treasuries, bitcoin) are selling off in concert with this idea.

Again, my argument is not philosophical.

We can't stop the government from governing, despite our potential differences in the definition of govern. 
What we can do is comply with existing rules, adapt to new ones, and fight for fairness and justice for future ones from all sovereign governments.

I disagree.  I think TA is even more relevant in the crytpocurrency markets because traditional valuation metrics and models do not apply to bitcoin due to the lack of cashflow or otherwise intrinsic value.  At this point in its life cycle, all of its value is imputed by the market, making it more susceptible to psychological and behavioral influences (even more so than highly speculative commodities futures markets).
As a side note, much of TA is based on fractal and fibonacci mathematics.

I fully agree that there are situations (perhaps many) in which the fees will certainly be more than trivial.

Lol, 'fixing' the gov't?! I don't even know what this means.  Any suggestions on how to do this?  You make it seem pretty easy! Regardless, you make a good point, but I was merely saying that gov't regulation hasn't improved the situation whatsoever.  Imperfect information continues to exist, probably even to a greater extent because new regulation = more stuff to interpret, enact and comply with.  Whether they SHOULD or not is a totally different conversation.
As far as Reinhart and Rogoff, I would hardly call that a 'scandal'! Some of their hasty conclusions regarding austerity might be disproved in the long run, but to call it a scandal is FUD.

Primarily this concern:
"Seems odd to describe this as a polynomial-time attack"
Is there some part that does not run in polynomial time in the parameters of the system?
"I would argue incorrect to describe the result as "broken crypto", as this has little to do with the cryptographic components of Bitcoin, and is more a fundamental design limitation."
Cryptography is not limited to hash functions and digital signatures (the two primary cryptographic primitives used in Bitcoin). The "broken crypto" refers to the fact that Bitcoin fails to meet the security definition for digital cash, a type of cryptosystem. Moreover, Bitcoin is not secure as a multiparty computation protocol (also a kind of crypto) against malicious parties, as the attacker's work is polynomial in the system's parameters.
One should not make the mistake of trying to separate the security of cryptographic building blocks from the security of a system as a whole. My "pet" example of this fallacy is "robust" encryption. In a nutshell, an encryption system is "robust" if only the intended recipient can receive a valid message. Using PGP to sign and then encrypt a message is not robust, even though the signature system, hash functions, and ciphers in PGP are secure as signature systems, hash functions, and ciphers. The reason is pretty clear: if you send a signed+encrypted message to me, I can decrypt it, encrypt the signed message for someone else, and then send them a valid message.
For most PGP users, robustness is not an important security property; usually, the recipient's name or some other identifying detail will be clearly written in the message. On the other hand, for Bitcoin, the protection against double spending is absolutely necessary; a polynomial time double spending attack on Bitcoin is very bad.
"As a workaround, merchants will just demand more confirmations for higher-valued transactions"
Which only forces the attacker to make a polynomial increase in their work. An attacker only needs to do as much work as the sum of the work done by all other participants in the system to remove any workaround. Right now, that is well within the reach of governments, banks, and perhaps the larger criminal enterprises of this world.
"Checks and physical cash also wouldn't meet your definition of formal security, but seem to work in practice."
It would not be the first time someone has proposed that digital cash go beyond what is possible with physical cash (see Page 2, Property (e)):

I beg to differ.  I think Satoshi created this thing to be in diametric opposition to fiat currencies philosophically.  Again, if companies, institutions, and gov'ts began printing there own fiat crypto's they would only be worth what the people in those networks appropriated to their value, which in my opinion wouldn't be much of anything.  Everyone that had already been exposed to what bitcoin is would automatically default back to bitcoin due to its scarcity and ease of use ACROSS ALL platforms and borders.

You may very well be right, but I want to point out a few things:
1.) there is massive selection bias in your sample.  People on this sub are NOT representative of the population at large.  If you go to mainstream websites with Bitcoin coverage, the comments are overwhelming skeptical.
2.) If this indeed is the top/near top of a bubble, why did it not pop last weekend on the selloff from $900 to $450?  Would have been a perfect time for a real head snapping decline as we saw over a 2 day period in April.
3.) The charts just aren't confirming this right now.  Granted, they change quickly, but the technicals are saying there is room to run and overbought conditions are diminishing with the recent volatility.
Regardless, we have been selling on the way up, and buying on pullbacks.  It's not rocket science.  Thanks for your input cybrbeast!

I will grant you that they want their cut and WILL get it at the end of the day (I don't disagree that they should).  However, just like with any other asset class, until that asset is converted back into US dollars, it doesnt matter what economic gains you have because they are 'unrealized' (at least for cap gains purposes).  Also, the govt would be wiser to simply tax consumption whenever possible.  If you walk into a retail space and spend bitcoins, it will be entered into the 'system'.  This actually makes it easier to track transactions w major companies and institutions for tax purposes because under the table cash transactions will be eliminated.
I know the argument will be that bitcoin makes it easier to conduct criminal activities, ie laundering, trafficking, etc., however I would rebutt by saying cash is worse in almost all areas of criminality.  AND, people will find a way to get/do what they want (including crime) despite what medium we are currently using to exchanges goods.  just my .02btc...

You trusted your money to unknown individuals running unregulated exchanges selling unregulated securities based on an unregulated currency. Sorry for your loss, but you have no one to blame but yourself. Speculation is a risky game, due diligence is crucial, and skepticism is priceless. Hold coins in cold storage if you want to be safe.

“It’s easy to criticize experimenting with the livelihoods of the poor,” Davidson wrote. “We have to try some new things, probably many new things. And we have to accept that some of them won’t work.”

Yes, but I think some of that fee comes from assuming that the 500,000 units for a board seat will be issued and bought.  If this happens, TAT will have to commit more time and resources to managing this investment vehicle, hence a higher fee (and likely a small premium on the shares in the future).  Like I said, I think :)

I've always found it easy to get bitcoins, but then again I am one of the geeky people you are referring to.  
I'll concede that this a checkmark in the 'pro' category.  I still wonder about timing (exit?) and risk management (boo paper assets).
And, if this thing does implode, it will tarnish bitcoin for a long time.  Might be worth the risk, but skepticism and inquisitiveness will help us be more sure that it is.

My recommendation is to spend a little more time researching what bitcoin actually is, and less time on trying to arb the market in the short-term on bitfloor.  The difference between 141 and 149 is minuscule compared the two most likely outcomes, 0 or 1000000 (feel free to add or subtract 000's as necessary).  Damn this shortsightedness!

I finish filling up and go up to the cashier to ask for air.  I see a sign that says "Shift Change, Reopen in 15min".  Keep in mind that the booth is completely glass and we can see everything that is going on.  Well, what is going on is that both cashiers, incoming and outgoing, have to manually count every cent and cannot switch until both employees can verify the till.  
Needless to say, it was torture standing there watching this display for 10 min while the line builds and builds behind me.  I didn't even need to buy anything! 
This process would be eliminated with the use of bitcoin.  We need bitcoin.

Bullocks!  That's like saying that because Newmont Mining's (NYSE: NEM) cost of production is much lower than many more recently incorporated mining companies' cost of production that the entire industry's profitability should be based on the company with the lowest cost of production.
That's not how the game works.  Why do you think no one is buying mining equipment anymore and many ASIC shops are filing for bankruptcy?  ITS TOO EXPENSIVE!  If I could get into the game at 41 a coin, I would. I have the cash.  The analysis simply doesn't make sense if you take into account the current cost of the equipment and difficulty increases.
I would love to be proven wrong here.  Please provide some numbers if you want to be taken seriously.
EDIT: Not saying blockchain is right with their calcs, just saying that there is more cost that goes into building a fully functioning ASIC farm than what either of you are assuming.  Are there depreciation schedules and expense tax benefits to BTC mining equipment investments?  What about the opportunity cost of setting the thing up and monitoring (ie, labor)?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:59:18
I've heard you posit this before and I will say the same thing again, Just don't undertake a project that has an expected return &lt; the expected appreciation of bitcoin given your time horizon.  This incentivizes more disciplined behavior and more dedication to the project.  Hopefully, no one will be making risky loans during the infant stages of this technology, however.  10% deflation is manageable and sustainable, 100% is not.  Stability is key, and I think we get there, but slowly and painfully (for some).
GREAT questions, btw.  Extremely relevant and thought provoking.  We need more of these threads!  Wish I had time to chat, but gotta go to work (ie, have drinks with skeptics :)

I won't go into my valuation methods due to complexity, but just observing the dividend alone and comparing that to the average S&amp;P 500 dividend (many don't even pay one anymore) it is apparent that the stock is undervalued still.
Lets assume the div evens out at .012/share (last week was .036!).  At a share price of 2.50, the div yield = 0.48%/week which annualized = 24.960%/year.  This is a WAY better div yield than 99.9% of the S&amp;P!  Because price and div yield are inversely related, as the price goes up, the div yield will come down to a more normalized 5-10%.  Using this math alone, you can see how much upside there is :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:47:18

B.S.  
I agree with amputeenager.  Assuming the current market price, they should be holding about 33,000btc.  Looking at the chart, there were well over 33,000 coins traded on Bitstamp alone yesterday, and that was on a major US holiday.  The market may take a 100 - 200 $ hit in the very short term, but that's normal price action now for bitcoin.
I, and I'm sure many others, could care less that a bunch of morons decided to trust their money to these guys in hopes of buying drugs.

blah, blah, blah. More totalitarian talk. You sound like a bureaucrat.  Do you work for the state?  Is your livelihood tied to the dominance of the state?
As far as your argument about healthcare (which I've heard multiple time from statist friends and colleugues), I think it is philosophically flawed. 'Well, what about poor people who need help', you ask?  The bitcoin community (see Sean's Outpost) has proven that those in real need can be taken care of communally.  Those who are impoverished or unhealthy for reasons of their own doing, tough luck.  Since when did it become the responsibility of everyone but the individual to take care of the individual?
Also, please explain why healthcare consumers are not consumers?  As an economist and political scientist, am I curious how healthcare is the exception to every economic rule going back to Adam Smith.  You may be right, but this occurrence is highly unnatural and unsustainable.
BTW, I'm pretty sure that you would be doing the shopping BEFORE the heart attack so that when you have one, you know where you can go or who you can call to be ensured care.

Despite my degrees, this in the kind of thinking that steered me away from a career in mainstream economics.  Bitcoin is the FREE MARKET.  Your models, schedules, and estimates are meaningless.  We want it this way and the market will determine what level is best and when.

I don't have enough information to make a statement about the Bitcoin Foundation's intentions, but I do know that educating people about bitcoin, whether they are in Washington or on Mainstreet, is important. If you disagree with that, good luck with whatever your mission is.

Not trying to be an a-hole, but I just flat out disagree.  You could have said the same exact stuff about the internet four years after its inception, and you would have been dead wrong.
Of course its not user friendly yet, its a technological infant.  This will come with time. IMO, it will be so user friendly that most people wont even know they are using it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:37:12
I don't think you have a very good idea of how markets work.  When you and everyone I speak to say 'you can bet I'll use it as an opportunity to buy more, but I just can't bring myself to buy in at this point', then it might or might not be a bubble but i guarantee that it is going higher.
Not only that, if you study the fundamentals, intricacies, and nuances of bitcoin, you will see how efficient its design and functionality really are, thus justifying the current price appreciation imho.  SO, demand + limited supply + fundamental value = BTC is going higher.
I suggest reading more about bitcoin, and worrying less about price. After all, price is irrelevant ;-)

If you want to 'save' an inflating (depreciating) asset over one that is appreciating, be my guest.  All fractional reserve banking does is incentivize profligate spending, malinvestment, and credit over-extension. When people realize that the BS that was shoved down their throats as absolutes at their Ivy League schools is fundamentally incorrect , talk about a bank run :) They, the fed, should be scared.

For starters, look into paper wallets for savings (savings account).  Then keep the medium you have them on in an extremely safe place where only you and your close loved ones know where it is. For small amounts (your current or 'checking' account), an e-wallet like blockchain.info should suffice.
Also, before you put funds into the paper wallet, I would suggest sending your BTC to/through a few different bitcoin addresses in order to help w anonymity.
If there are any other that wish to chime in w good ideas, please do!  I know I open to new security measures.  I see this as one area where the bitcoin community needs to provide more clarity, and one that has a sizable profit opportunity.

Thanks for the reply, and I welcome your skepticism!  As far as collaborating, I'm game.  Lets PM or exchange emails if you have some ideas to discuss.  I know I do.
As far as your major concern regarding bitcoin viability, I get where you are coming from but you are missing the forest for the trees, so to speak.  If companies and governments attempt to coop the crypto-currency market, they would be competing against an already established network that formed due to the fact that they DID NOT want centralized system.  If you attempt to centralize the idea, it losing a fundamental aspect of it that gives it its value.  
Lets talk.  But in the meantime I suggest reading up a little more on what bitcoin really is.  Cheers :)

Don't get me wrong, that would be great!  But I think the benefits of such a system (bitcoin) are more aligned with the laws of nature, and if preclusion of projects that don't have a high potential for high return have to be sacrificed for better ones, then so be it.

My company publishes the oldest, most subscribed to, and most well respected bitcoin market analysis report in existence, so I am fully aware of the market dynamics.
Think of this from their perspective.  Let say they own 1 million btc as they claim.  A $5 price move to the downside is a $5 million dollar loss.  That's quite substantial.  
Yesterday a 15k btc sell order precipitated a drop in the market from ~94.20 to ~86.00 (-8.6758%).  If a relatively minor sale such as this can cause the market to plunge so dramatically, then imagine what a SERIES of 15k sells, up to 1 mil, would do to the market (and in essence their wealth in btc)!
Again, I am not here to rain on anyones parade, but having been formally trained in market analysis and having 10+ years of trading/investing experience, it is always a good idea to examine new issues in depth.
I am pro Bitcoin!  Our business model relies on bitcoin.  However temporal exuberance without full comprehension can get people in serious financial trouble.

These guys really are great.  In fact, I'll throw a personal anecdote in here to let you all know how legit these guys are:
I bought a GPU (7950) for about 3.71btc from bitcoinstore and apparently right when I placed my order it went to 'backordered' status.   I wrote CS saying that time was of the essence and if it wasn't going to ship for awhile, then I wanted a refund.  A few days had passed since the initial purchase while all this was going on when they confirmed it would be awhile to ship and they would issue a refund.  A few days later I check my wallet and lo and behold there is the 3.71btc  refund.  
What was so surprising about all this was that the price of btc had jumped about $20 since the purchase and yet they still gave me the full original amount.  They had no obligation to do this for me, but decided to anyway.  
tl;dr: Stand up operation that can be trusted.  Use them.
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:57:18
I'm not trying to undermine anyone, or cast doubt on anyone else's education, perspective, or circumstance, I just want the twins to explain why they are doing this, why now, and why not just buy BTC outright.  
Surely a PM or Hedgy can build his/her own btc portfolio.  They are pretty easy to get and free to store.  The reason why gold and silver ETF's exist (in theory) is because physical is difficult to obtain, and very expensive to store.
Again, this is all food for thought.  Sorry for the over-exuberance showcased in my choice of title (for real!) :)

Most people (apparently, including yourself) are very short-sighted.  Nobody that ever did anything truly great, or made a very large amount of money (more your language?), started out strictly wanting to make money.  They did great things by believing in something, working hard at it, and sticking with it in the tough times.  
You are acting out of greed, and in the end, this will burn you.  Have fun being an accountant while the rest of us bitcoiners TRY to do great things. No guarantee of success, but I think trying is enough for most of us.
BTW, thanks for one of the best discussions I've had on in days.  No hard feelings, we just feel stronger about bitcoin than most.  Cheers.

Great point about PM's and HFM's.  And I'm not as worried about them doing something improprietous as I am about the coins 'going missing' or getting hacked.  Investors need to be fully aware of the risks.
I think of this much like gold.  Limiting counterparty risk is key when dealing with real assets like this.  I would never recommend anyone invest in GLD, but I tell people everyday to go buy a little physical to hold.  Why?!  Counterparty risk and reliance on a paper asset for wealth preservation.  VERY RISKY!
Thanks for your thoughts!

First, the symbol HIM is not the same as ASICM, so it is not relevant to compare the div on HIM to ASICM.  Go to btct.co and check out the ASICMiner divs on there.  They are very volatile, but have been rising on average.
Also, you say that you think the share price and div will decrease, but you only explain why the div might go down.  Care to elaborate? Do you mean go down in BTC terms or USD terms?
Of course, if there is a spike, the literal amount of BTC they end up receiving for their goods would go down, however the amount of dollars they are receiving would be exactly the same.  Not only that, a spike would cause a demand spike for the equipment to mine, therefore they might sell more as well as be able to increase the usd price of that equipment. 
Also, regardless of the price spike (other than increasing difficulty) friedcat should still be able to maintain a significant portion of the network hashrate given his capacity and knowledge, giving stability to the div in terms of BTC, but making the divs MASSIVE in USD terms.  All in all, a price spike would be very good for shareholders (especially in usd terms).
As far as a massive, overnight price spike, as unlikely as that is, the prices of ASICMiner equipment would not really have time to adjust to the spike in the very short term (hours).  Also, no on is going to want to spend coins on any goods until prices are able to adequately adjust.  
I have to admit, I am a little confused by your scenario.  Please feel free to ask if you have questions or I failed to communicate properly.
