That's not right. The lightning network still uses BTC. No swapping required.
It would make more sense to say that you "move" your BTC into the LN

Lightning Network
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:12:27
Yes. At current fee levels, each block contains around 4.5 BTC of fees, which miners earn in addition to the 12.5 BTC block subsidy. At this rate, after the next two halvings, a majority of mining rewards will come from fees. The block subsidy will become negligible compared to fees, long before it gets to 0.

Sounds like you are combining many inputs to spend that 0.01. Your change should be cheaper to spend as it will be in a single output. But lately I've been paying around $5 AUD for normal sized transactions.

In Australia, many small merchants charge a 1% - 3% fee. Or have a flat fee for payments below a threshold.

Confirming spam transactions isn't really a feature that benefits users. Bitcoin has processed more transactions than BTC since the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:46:50
You're relying on third parties to get access to the network, but you're not trusting them.
It's similar to the main bitcoin network: you rely on your peers to pass block / transaction data, but you don't trust them.
I think it's more likely that wallet users will open channels with the wallet provider (eg. Mycelium, Trezor, Electrum) and those wallet services will peer with commercial payment networks which the merchants are connected to.

And now you've discovered cryptography. Go do a free online course in it if you're curious :)

Wow, I just realized how good that number looks. Can't wait to see it for AUD and then USD.
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:55:06


Your math is way off. An order of magnitude is 10x. Bitcoin's market cap is $20B and you quoted gold at $7T which means 10% of gold is $700B. How would a $700B infusion into BTC only raise the market cap by $180B? I'd say it would rise closer to 2 orders of magnitude.

That's why we run signed binaries and don't build from source for production versions

The blockchain is already handling nearly the maximum transaction throughput. Off chain transactions through payment channels is where the growth in tx volume should occur.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:58:44
I did on the weekend. I sold early into the rally at ~0.065. I'm kicking myself that I didn't give the rally longer, but in general its great to have got all this extra BTC. Very happy!

Thanks for keeping the network secure! :)
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:30:54
Does this account for the expected growth in JPM's transaction volume? Also I expect that Bitcoin's total tx volume will grow way faster than 2x once lightning network launches.

Why the emphasis on node count? That's not what matters.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:33:54
With a trezor, you absolutely own and control your own keys.
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:22:10
Bitcoin's PoW needs to be easily verifiable. So I can do a double SHA256 on a blockhash to verify that it's correct and below the target value. This gives me instant proof that exahashes of work were done to produce that block.
If someone is attaching some rendered movie frames to a block, how can I verify the work was correct without re-rendering everything myself and comparing the result?
Also, bitcoin PoW needs to also prove the work was done *after* the last block was produced (not before, to prevent people pre-computing large chains), also not solved with the rendering thing.
And finally, bitcoin PoW needs to be progress-free, meaning its not a race where the person with the fastest hardware will win every time. It needs to be like a lottery, so that small miners will still occasionally win at the expected rate.

Why weren't the support emails read, so that you became aware of the situation right away? Seems like Coinbase is not in touch with their customers.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:31:59
No no. First, set up your trezor wallet. The trezor keys are ALWAYS offline and any address you get from the trezor is secure.  Copy down a receive addresss from your trezor and then go to the ATM and withdraw to that address.
Your wallet does not need to be online when receiving coins. All coins are stored in the blockchain, not in wallets. Wallets just hold the keys which are needed when you want to SPEND from the address.

Not a great opening line, because if you say things like that, the more technical types (eg. Core devs) will disagree.
There is no "the memory pool". Each node has its own memory pool. One node's pool is not necessarily the same size as anothers.  Also in recent core versions, it can't grow infinitely. There's a mem pool max size. After you hit that, it will evict less valuable transactions. So to say that it will grow infinitely is false.
I'm assuming what you really mean is that the total number of transactions that never get confirmed will grow infinitely. Thats something thats expected because there is no cost to creating unconfirmed transactions. I could write code to generate an infinite chain of feeless transactions easily. Or if I pay 1 satoshi fee then I can make 100 million transactions for each bitcoin i have. My point is that it's only relevant to consider transactions above a given fee rate, since it is expected that there can be an infinite tail of low fee transactions.

@_date: 2017-05-23 22:17:27
If I understand this, it still caps the non-witness data at 1MB. Can anyone give some estimates on what the total block size is likely to be if its full of non-segwit transactions, and also when its full of segwit transactions?
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:46:25
Nice gif. Will upvote when we actually hit $2500.
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:45:45
I think Andreas' reply was very wise:








@_date: 2017-05-10 22:37:02
What point are you trying to make in relation to the original post?
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:43:21
My transactions are usually 200-300 bytes. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:53:23
So then is this a capacity reduction compared to BIP141 on its own? Because segwit was going to allow &gt;2MB total size.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:02:17
You forgot one vital piece; you need some miner support or it goes nowhere.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:21:32
I don't believe there is any replay protection in BIP148. So you should assume your transaction will be confirmed in both chains. I would be careful about spending until there's a clear winner.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:15:30
What's being done about replay protection? Can we assume that if there's a split, our transactions will be confirmed on both chains?
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:48:20
I agree with that, but I think we're at the point where segwit is ready to go. It should be activated. This is an update to layer 1 that will enable more rapid experimentation at layer 2. Similar to how TCP/IP changes slowly but the web evolves quickly. Without segwit we lack a good platform for L2.
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:24:28
Hence, part of the implementation
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:53:47
Miners just need to keep signalling segwit like they are now, and it will go fine. If some pull out then we could see segwit not activated and things could hit a standstill again.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:34:57
You mean inevitable?
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:01:04
The next signaling period starts in ~12 hours from now. We need to have 95% of blocks signalling for segwit over the following 2016 block period, then it will be locked in and activate 2016 blocks after that
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:12:34
Altcoins can't send bitcoin. Duh.
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:18:05
We don't have segwit yet. Once it's locked I think the market will react properly.

Shhh, don't tell him that Amazon has done 3 stock splits since 1997. Your $1.50 share would actually be worth $12K.   
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:24:58
That's not true about the hard fork. Core nodes wouldn't care because they don't understand bit 4. They'd only be forcing segwit2x nodes to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:29:29
They won't be incompatible with core if miners enforce mandatory segwit signalling prior to August 1st, which is what Segwit2x will do.
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:16:57
So true. And this is why I'm expecting bip148 to go nowhere. I would be surprised to see even a few blocks mined. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:39:56
Bitcoin is the most decentralized cryptocurrency and is beyond anyone's control. It's a force in its own right. The recent rise in fees and stalemate on scaling are just phenomemon that have arisen naturally as part of its evolution.
I don't see it that there was some strategic pivot or dropping of ideas, because bitcoin as a whole does not have its own strategy and ideas, it's just a force that is. No one can predict what will happen in the future, because no one can control it, which is what makes it so great.   
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:35:59
Maybe you could research to find which pools do full RBF and try submitting the transaction directly to them?
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:20:14
Just replenish your coins after you spend. Then you can enjoy both spending and hodling.
