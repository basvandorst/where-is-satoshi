ICANN wouldn't support it because it's against their interests. Why would they give up their position of power to support something that lets people get domains for (essentially) free?
In an ideal world, sure... but we aren't in an ideal world. It's far easier to get Firefox (a free project) to support a free domain system...
Seriously you sound like you're looking for an argument. I'm not trying to make one; I want to support the project, but the methods you're suggesting aren't the easiest ways to get wide spread adoption which is the goal...

You actually don't need a lawyer for this. Since all credit cards are digital property under united states law you can report said individuals to the FBI and IC3. While this may seem counter-intuitive and it won't help you get your money back they can start forming a case against the individual and if even just a few businesses report the same person it can become a solid case overnight. Of course I'm not a lawyer; I'm just informing you that some people who actually work these cases care and the more you report the more likely it is that they will be caught. A photo of them holding their ID is pretty good proof in-of-itself.

If you aren't willing to only accept cash for your gift cards then I'd suggest you take a photo of the person holding their ID. That way if it happens again you can just report fraud to the government.

Cloudflare doesn't "keep sites online" so much as it caches images and other content in geographically close locations so pages load faster when the site is up. It has a few other features like analytics, redirects, dns and ssl certificates all for the low price of $0 per month. The reason you see cloudflare everywhere is because it's a really great product.

Just google accept credit cards for my business and look at the fees. My business pays $0.15 plus 1.9% of the transaction. I know many businesses that pay even more. Visa and Mastercard are billion dollar businesses, but they don't usually pay the merchant for your purchases... a bank does... that's why your credit cards are through Citi or Capital One.

Yes, but eventually that will stop. Bitcoin has a 21 million coin cap. The coins were given to miners initially to help support the network as the number of transactions (and their associated fees) wouldn't have provided any incentive to mine. Bitcoin's mining reward is cut in 1/2 about every 4 years. See Projected Coins Long Term on this page for more information: 
Currently over 75% of the coins that will ever be mined have been mined. By 2025 that will be about 95%.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:35:10
There's little way of confirming if a transaction originated from your IP. If they do make bitcoin illegal then just move your bitcoin to a new wallet and start using a VPN. Buying bitcoin will get harder if that happens but a cash deal with a local seller would still be very viable. The government tried to stop drugs, they failed, they'll fail here too.

Plenty of predictions are wrong too. It's easy to look back now and say things turned out differently. Plenty of people predicted flying cars and energy so cheap that people wouldn't have electric bills anymore... Just because people are right or wrong doesn't mean their statements were made without thinking.

Modern HVDC wasn't invented until 1930. I'll stand by my statement since I meant "at that point in time". So allow me to rephrase: DC power WAS horrible for long range transmission at the time and still is way more costly than AC.

@_date: 2018-02-12 01:00:44
All of these made sense at the time. All of these ideas had flaws (much the same way bitcoin does) that made them bad solutions at that point...
1800: no one had really ever gone that fast to know if the air became harder to breathe at those speeds in much the same way that we didn't know there wasn't oxygen on the moon without having visited it.
1859: At this point we had no ability to scan underground and people usually found oil when it broke the surface. Imagine digging random holes everywhere in a hope to find a nickle you lost...
1876: The telephone not only required a wire between both points, but electricity in every location. This would only allow phone calls between two fixed points. So if you wanted to make phone calls to different people you'd need a different phone for each line connecting two points. This was later solved by operators and patch cables (and even later automated), but at the time it seemed ridiculous to run hundreds of wires to every home to make calls in a small town possible.
1880: At that point in time no one wanted to house a generator in their backyard. DC power is horrible for long range transmission so the first people to have light bulbs needed a power station on their block. If you are personally going to cart fuel somewhere for light anyway why not just use fuel when you need light?
1902: It requires a ton of fuel, engineering and talent to make planes work. At this point no one had a working plane and to get a plane that would be useful for anything of substance took decades.
1903: At this point many automobiles had an incredibly short range, were virtually unusable without tons of practice and lacked even basic safety features. You try driving a sub-1 horsepower engine with a wooden frame very far and you'll quickly discover horses to be a better alternative too.
1916: It's the height of trench warfare and you want to use a vehicle that falls into the trench and becomes useless. Plus it's super easy to disable these vehicles at this point in time. A soldier armed with a pistol can disable the treads, the guns have blind spots and the engines frequently break down on their own due to stress.
1921: There literally was no way to know if anyone was listening to the radio at this point. With the low prevalence of radios in households and the fact that the first ad didn't even run on the radio until the end of 1922 and you get the picture...
1927: I can't refute the stupidity of this statement.
1946: Yeah there wasn't much content running on TV at this point and no content = no viewers. Very few studios were investing in TV broadcasting at this point.
1977: The computers of this age were the size of a grocery store. Who has room in their house for a series of boxes that take upwards of 3,000 square feet?
1995: This was ignorant I'll grant that.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:17:13
Yes a single bitcoin can be split indefinitely. You can just use a different wallet if your existing one becomes outdated. Keep in mind that an exchange (like Coinbase, Gemini, etc...) is not a wallet. If they go out of business and they have your coins there's not much you can do. A desktop/trezor wallet is the only way to guard your coins.

ELI15: Bitcoin is a currency that is decentralized, meaning no one entity controls it. Bitcoin is a digital ledger of purchases that uses cryptography to mathematically assign and hold stores of value. Bitcoin users use applications called wallets to store their share of value. Bitcoin as a currency is Deflationary in nature and as such there will only ever be ~21 million coins in existence. 
Should you own own some? That's up to you... many on this subreddit view bitcoin as a kind of currency Jesus as it prevents the government and other entities from every taking away or devaluing your money. Those people often tout the meme that a single Bitcoin will eventually be enough to buy a house or make one a Millionare in USD. Bitcoin isn't perfect and there are those that argue that it's price is inflated to an extreme degree or that it will never catch traction among the average population (even though I can currently buy almost anything I need with bitcoin).
ELI5: Bitcoin is a currency much like the dollar is currency. You can use Bitcoin to save or to buy things. Bitcoin is different from other currencies because there are a limited number of bitcoins and no one can print more of them unlike the dollar. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:28:45
He's implying we'll stop tracking the value of a single bitcoin and start displaying fractions of a bitcoin instead. mBTC = 1/1000 of a bitcoin, Satoshi / Sat = 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin.

It doesn't change the number of bitcoins. It changes what the reward is for mining. The Bitcoin block mining reward halves every 210,000 blocks, the coin reward will decrease from 25 to 12.5 coins.
