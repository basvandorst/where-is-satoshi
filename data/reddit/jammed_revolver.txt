There's never been a 'safe' time to buy. If you're looking for a quick win you either buy now and hope August 1 goes off without a hitch, or you buy just before when market may crash as people sell in worry.
Realistically the only way to be 'safe' right now is to buy now, expect a dip/crash and hold through any potential forks in a private wallet. Could we crash to $1000? Sure. Who knows. Or it all goes fine and we go to $3200 August 14th. Then it implodes for the 8MB fork. So many ifs.
Basically only buy if you're gonna hold. Maybe look for a dip if you want to not feel so bad if we crash, but I'd say you should go in with the mindset of holding till at least end of the year.

Your next significant dip opportunity MAY (I repeat) MAY occur around August 11th-13th. But as the news comes in this will probably be a sharp upturn if  starts being signaled in significant measures so it's a narrow window. 
This is a good comment to get your head wrapped around the dates and potential dip opportunities. 
Could it go as low as what you're thinking? I don't know. I got in happily at 2.3k and am holding till post November. We get past that hard fork and we're going to the moon. Point is, you could buy now and if we got to that point you'd still make bank.
