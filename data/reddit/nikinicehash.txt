NiceHash has 3% service fee. The payouts are automatic and on the next schedule:
- for balances greater than 0.001 BTC, you get paid every 4 weeks
- for balances greater than 0.01 BTC, you get paid every week
- for balances greater than 0.1 BTC, you get paid every day
The profitability depends on the hardware you have, but we also offer a service of buying hashing power (if you don't have the mining equipment). The process is a little more complicated than regular cloud mining, but here is a nice guide if you are interested:

Why not? If you are interested in trying it out, you can check out NiceHash Miner. You will technically mine altcoins, but earn bitcoins.

If you don't trust in regular cloud mining contracts, you can check out NiceHash's approach to cloud mining: 
The main differences with classical cloud mining are:
- you pay as you mine (if you cancel order at any time, you get the remaining funds back)
- you select the pool to mine on
- orders usually lasts from few minutes to 14 days
- you can order massive hashing power
- minimum investment is 0.01 BTC (for any coin)

When you are mining at NiceHash, you are monitoring your balance here: 
You don't get paid directly to your NiceHash wallet - you have to wait for the payment schedule like everyone else.

Let me cite Jox from BitcoinTalk over here: 
"We are getting exchange rate data from 3rd party API and sometimes it just freaks out. Also, if it happens again, calm yourself by checking on your bitcoins, since you get paid in them and not in the USD (yet, at least ;))."

This news also explains the reasons behind it: 
By the way, as said, the fee doesn't apply if the balances is greater than 0.005 BTC and since the minimum order price is 0.01 BTC, there isn't really any reason to deposit less than 0.005 BTC.

On NiceHash you don't mine BTC, you are mining other algorithms, but we pay you in BTC.

First some things about NiceHash:
- we operate since 2014
- we have served more than 2,000,000 orders
- we have more than 100,000 registered users
- we have more than 80,000 daily active miners
- we have paid more than 70,000 BTC to our miners ([some latest payments](
Chrome and some antivirus software often block download of NiceHash Miner because it contains several open-sourced miners that were exploited in the past and are now unfortunately black-listed, but they are not harmful in any way. If you want to run it, you would probably have to to either disable antivirus until NHM starts running or white-list the blocked files.

We are established company since 2014. You can check our recent payments here:

Hello! We have recently changed the payout schedule so the minimum payouts are now for balances greater than 0.01 BTC if you are using external wallet provider and 0.001 BTC if you are using NiceHash wallet. We have applied this new schedule because the fees of applying bitcoin transactions are enormous. Please, read this news for more information: 
We are working on implementing alternative payout methods (such as Ethereum or fiat currency), but we are still looking for viable partners.

NiceHash is a marketplace that connects miners (sellers of hashing power) with buyers of hashing power (those that don't have the equipment to mine for themselves or see an opportunity to order massive hashing power for affordable price).
There is a marketplace for each of 20+ algorithms where buyers place orders and bid on how much they will pay for hashing power. They also select the pool on which they want to mine and pay for that hashing power in bitcoins. These bitcoins are then paid to you for mining. So they practically hire you for mining for them - and the rewards they get from that mining stays to them.

If you are detected in [your mining stats]( then your BTC address is valid.
The payments are automatic and scheduled:
- balances greater than 0.1 BTC are paid out to your BTC address once a day
- balances greater than 0.01 BTC are paid out to your BTC address once a week (Fridays)
- balances greater than 0.001 BTC are paid out to your BTC address once every 4 weeks (Fridays)

Almost certainly your earnings dropped because there is small amount of orders and the buyers are paying less for that algorithm. You can check orders for LBRY here:

Good! If you will have any questions - we are here :)
@_date: 2017-05-03 07:05:42
We don't exchange altcoins for bitcoins. NiceHash is a marketplace.
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:24:56
Join NiceHash - We offer a unique payment scheme, where you are mining Scrypt but get paid in bitcoins. More info: 
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:07:28
Just to correct you a little bit :) We don't have Monero/BTC exchange rate. NiceHash is a marketplace, so sellers/miners get paid the price buyers set on their orders. That's why there might be a change between mining on the pool versus mining on the NiceHash. That is also the reason why you as a seller/miner get paid in bitcoins - because buyer pay you in bitcoins to do mining for them.

Bitcoins are mined (the market cap is currently 16,307,725 BTC  ) and then people use them and transfer them from wallet to wallet. Bitcoins can also be bough on different  exchange sites - but even those bitcoins were mined somewhere at some point.

He didn't used cloud mining, he is a seller at NiceHash. This means that was mining with his hardware (probably GPU and CPU) different altocoins and he will get paid in bitcoins.
We are a marketplace and we don't work as regular cloud mining company. Buyers are buying services as a cloud mining, but it is called cloud mining because they don't own the hardware (our sellers/miners do). There are no contracts, buyers pay on pay-as-you-mine basis without upfront payments and can cancel their orders at any time (and get returned whatever they haven't spend). Our orders lasts from few minutes to 10 days.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:27:05
Unfortunately, no. We don't transfer funds from one wallet to another. If you are making around 0.0017 BTC/day, then you will reach 0.01 BTC in less than a week.

I think that Firefox doesn't block the download. Or if you try downloading from [this website]( there are instructions in popup window how to download it with Chrome anyhow. As for the antivirus,  I don't have the exact answer.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:35:55
I will quote myself here as well.
