History.  Only tangible assets have kept their value over time: property, works of art, gold &amp; silver, moon rocks, shares of profitable companies, rare coins.
BTC will probably always have *some* value, but talk of their value reaching the moon is utter nonsense, IMHO.

Exactly right.  It's a club.  As long as there are *believers*, you're fine, just as with Magic cards and Peanut the Beanie Babies.  When you analyze it, though, it's built on air.

Most of BTC’s value comes from the fact that it provides a useful tool for moving funds around. The supply of coins is ultimately limited, which helps keep some kind of floor under the price, but ultimately it’s just a tool and not a true store of value, like gold.

The BTC opportunity was when it was $1, not $10,000.  It's done.

Every culture values it, and a 1000-oz bar has bought you at least a couple of nice houses for generations.  In terms of money, currency has gold as its foundation and BTC has currency as its foundation.

Not really sure. Tried to buy some last week to learn more. Couldn’t get past the credit card authorization. Wanted to buy BTC when it was in the 3-range, figuring that was some kind of floor.

In hindsight, everyone should have bought BTC back in Apr: [

It has no real value, if you think about it.  If it did, it would be sitting in central bank vaults.

I makes them collectable, but not hard assets like real estate, stocks, barrels of oil etc., or even the US$ in the short term.
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:08:21
Call me crazy, but I can't really envision people paying $30,000 for what is essentially *air*.

I'm here to offer an opinion, which is that the value of a BTC is questionable.  It's mostly just a tool for moving funds around.  Nothing is priced in BTC and it can't be exchanged for things like commodities.
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:39:18


I have, and concluded that much of its value is imaginary.  It has some value, just like Magic cards and Peanut the royal blue Beanie Baby elephant.  Proponents want to own and trade them, which is fine, but just ask anyone who paid $5,000 for Peanut in the 1990s how much they could sell it for today.

Challenge accepted.

Oh, didn’t realize this was the BTC-Fans-Only sub. I don’t hate BTC, but people need to be told that its value is not tied to anything physical and therefore might vapourize one day.
@_date: 2019-07-24 19:03:46
Yeah, haha, used as payment for something that is priced in dollars. If you don’t see the difference (payment vs pricing), I can’t help you. Just keep buying BTC. We’ll talk again when you’re broke.

Even if it had all been mined, no one really needs it.

I view it as a tool, more useful to those fleeing Venezuela and narcos than Joe USA.  Sure it has some value, but when the chips are down it will be worthless.

The metals are priced in dollars, not BTC. They accept BTC as payment, provided you can pay within 15 minutes, but nowhere on the site do you see a BTC price for any of their metal products.

The same as a bond, only with a maturity date &lt;= 2 years.
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:05:55
Don’t think BTC will ever join the ranks of a hard currency. If it were a hard currency, then the business world would start pricing commodities in it.
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:37:44
For a pet rat, maybe.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:20:30
That's true over the long term, especially since 1972, but over the short term western currencies do have stability - unlike BTC which has dropped 30% in a couple of weeks.
I disagree that BTC is long-term *anything*, as long as producers price their goods and services in $$$.
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:31:53
Great question. No fiat currency has ever succeeded in the long term. When I was a kid a dollar was a fortune. If I grabbed one (ok, stole) from my mother’s purse, I’d run to the corner store, buy a loaf of bread (for 18¢) to look legit, toss it, and I still had all the money I would ever need for candy purchases that week.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:03:54


Where's the value though?  Can you exchange BTC for the CPU cycles that were required to create it?  Combined with block chain, it's a nice tool for moving money around, but if anything happens to the *hard* currencies it is priced in, goodbye BTC.  Nothing but a mirage.
@_date: 2019-07-28 17:09:03


In the short term, most western currencies are fairly stable.  If you live in the west, you're much better off with USD or things that are priced in them.
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:45:41
Fair enough. Anything that someone needs or wants has value, but society has gotten used to measuring value in currency, which can both a medium of exchange and a store of value.
Unlike national currencies, we don’t use BTC to measure the value of things. I think this is it’s Achilles heel, and explains why its value fluctuates wildly.

BTC has had its massive gain run, at least for the American dollar. It now derives most of its value from the US dollar and as a tool for moving funds around, having moved on from the public infatuation stage.
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:52:46
Fair enough.  No one in a country with a *stable* currency then.
