The market isn't moving based on XT or any client being released. That's seeing causality in tea leaves.

The economic majority's role is to incentivize/disincentive miners. It's sentiment is what the market price tells us. I don't know what poll or victory you are talking about, did you reply to the wrong comment?

Maybe. The point is with bitcoin the economic majority will always end up deciding anyway.

It's not just 75% of miners needed to fork. It's 75% of miners + economic majority.

Markets don't run on philosophical positions. Bitcoin works because economic incentives are aligned. Ideologies are meaningless to the market, so if Greg thinks there is some 'decree' based on something other than aligned economic will for profit, it's a worry because he doesn't get why, on a human level, the network is functioning.

Economic majority in bitcoin is bitcoin holders. People that can crash the price by selling. Not the "world majority". Bitcoin wouldn't have survived this long if incentives were aligned how you think.

There is no social contract. The contract is economic self preservation. That's why bitcoin is trustless. 
The core devs seem to have a deep understanding of why bitcoin works technically, and little to no understanding of why it works socially. Do they really think every bitcoin holder shares their ideologies? Do they think the network lives and dies on some arbitrary group mantra. If it did bitcoin would have died in 2009. Unbelievably naive.

It doesn't matter if certain types of purchases are insecure, they still have a use case and always will. It's insecure to trust that people will pay after eating at a restaurant. And the potential monetary loss for a restaurant is going to be greater than the average 0-conf bitcoin transaction, and yet restaurants take on that risk because it is more profitable to create good customer service and get repeat custom than it is implementing practices that stop the &lt;1% that are going to eat and run.

No, markets always react bearishly to uncertainty. Any potential forking tanks the price, but will not be sustained. What will sustain price falls is the idea of stalled growth/ bottlenecks/ use limiting because money will move to investments with more upside.

No, but it will often act as one because incentives in the bitcoin ecosystem will tend to help or hinder individuals in a way which makes them indirectly act cohesively, like ants in an ant nest.


Generally the price will follow their actions, but there can be a feedback loop. ie they feel less confident in bitcoin, they reduce their holdings, price falls, confidence falls. The exception to this is traders whose actions follow the price.


It is abstract in that it is not a specified group, and is whatever interacts with the market but it creates the framework for the miners decision matrix. In order for them to stay profitable the miners hands are tied by the economic majority. The economic majority is the key dynamic of the user-&gt;miner (security)-&gt;user feedback loop as well as a vital part of the consensus mechanism (miners are not ideological, they will mine for maximum profit, so it is the economic majority that decides what consensus rules are valid)

A client alone isn't enough, you actually need uncertainty. 2% running XT isn't going to cause uncertainty in the market, 40% would.
@_date: 2016-01-29 05:38:43
You don't understand economic majority with regard to bitcoin. It's people within the ecosystem (ie holders and people that can negatively effect price).

Generic "problems" aren't his issue. He's talking specifically about forks. 75% of devs can cause problems. As could 75% of exchanges. To fork successfully you need the economic majority.

The thing stopping future majorities from ruining bitcoin is the exact same thing that is stopping it from being ruined today, economic self interest. If that isn't enough then it isn't enough and bitcoin is doomed anyway. Bitcoin is always at a whim to the market-&gt;miner-&gt;user dynamic.
