One issue at a time. :)
I agree that Bitcoin's deflationary nature could be an issue for it to be used as a global reserve currency.  However, the USD clearly holds that honor for the foreseeable future.
I'm focussing on why Bitcoin has usefulness and hence value.  People often don't understand how the infrastructure/services built on top of the Bitcoin protocol provides value (and hence a sort of "physical backing").

I'd try to explain what gives Bitcoin intrinsic value (usefulness).  E.g.:
Bitcoin gains value (usefulness) through **network effects** and the **infrastructure** built on top of it with startups such as Bitpay (recently invested in by Asia's richest man Li Ka-shing), Coinbase (with $25 million in VC funding), Circle (with $9 million series A funding), Coinsetter, Robocoin, BTX Trader and many others.
Ultimately whatever protocol has the majority of infrastructure build on it will be very sticky. Bitcoin as an open source project can also adapt and be improved over time. Therefore we'd likely simply go from Bitcoin 1.0 to Bitcoin 2.0 if improvements are needed (just as with time we'll go from HTTP 1.0 to HTTP 2.0).
I'd also note that transaction volume on the Bitcoin network for purchases (and money transfers) creates a minimum market capitalization since bitcoin are being traded for real goods and services.
Bitcoin price = market capitalization / # of bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:11:03
Yes, dogecoin is down in terms of speculation.  Bitcoin has seen similar price declines in the past.  
However, dogecoin has pretty strong community support and is seeing adoption by businesses 2nd to bitcoin.  User adoption is more important than price or hashrate.

$10,000 per Bitcoin corresponds with a market cap of ~$100 billion.  This is similar to Paypal's annual transaction volume at ~$100 billion.
**If** Bitcoin gains similar mainstream adoption as Paypal then a $100 billion market cap (and hence $10,000 per coin) would be reasonable.
Investment from Wall Street and continued speculation can also further drive the price up.

Um, comparing interest based on activity on Reddit (not a perfect measure I realize) never even reached 1,000 subscribers whereas has 80,000+ subscribers and is growing.
In fact, seems to have a similar number of **active users** as if you compare "users here now", upvotes/post on the frontpage and comments/post on the frontpage.
That said, I'd still put my money on Bitcoin as that is where all the VC investments are (and don't think dogecoin is a threat).  It's just a fun way for people to get started with crypto.

The beauty of Bitcoin is as a decentralized protocol for electronic payments (just like HTTP and TCP for the Internet).  Bitcoin has many other uses beyond a payment network such as with colored coins, but I won't get into this.  It creates a common language for ecommerce web services to interact without a central authority. A couple examples:
1. Web services such as image processing object detection can be offered to anyone (in any country) as an on-demand service for Bitcoin.
2. Bitcoin ATMs in airports and major cities can enable easy currency conversion (with low fees due to competition). It makes it much cheaper to send money internationally.
With time this infrastructure will grow and volatility will decrease with a higher market capitalization.

It is the same argument for why Bitcoin has a clear lead.  Ultimately a digital currency protocol is only useful (and hence has value) when there is enough user adoption to maintain a critical mass.
Feathercoin was unable to reach a critical mass in user adoption and so it died.  Technical differences mostly matter only if they ultimately affect user adoption of the protocol.
Dogecoin not only has an active community on Reddit.  I've also seen Dogecoin mentioned on CNN, Fox, BBC, NPR, WSJ, etc.  That never happened with Feathercoin.

There is no need to attack other digitial currencies. Bitcoin has a clear first-mover advantage, but that doesn't preclude other coins from gaining adoption (and having network effects) over time.
Visa, Mastercard and Amex can coexist peacefully and there's nothing wrong with that.
Dogecoin doesn't diminish Bitcoin's value.  Both have active communities and that's fine.

Government backing of a new electronic currency could offer:
 - "instant confirmations" using an (optional) central trusted authority
 - better individual security against hacking (E.g. with FDIC)
 - support for charge-backs with merchant &amp; buyer identity

A rising tide doesn't lift all boats in this case.  Competing CCs introduce new supply with "alternative blockchains" and threaten the legitimacy of bitcoin.
We get long-term value from having one unified protocol and a single blockchain.
Altcoins are great for experimentation.  Any true advantages should be incorporated into the existing bitcoin protocol while maintaining the blockchain.

Maybe there's a first amendment argument, but no guarantees.  I don't think use of bitcoin for payments is protected as free speech.

Bitcoin has intrinsic value because it is **useful** as a decentralized protocol for electronic payments (just like HTTP and TCP for the Internet). It also has other uses that I won't get into.
It gains value (usefulness) through **network effects** and the **infrastructure built** on top of it with startups such as Bitpay (recently invested in by Asia's richest man Li Ka-shing), Coinbase (with $25 million in VC funding), Circle (with $9 million series A funding), Coinsetter, Robocoin, BTX Trader and many others.
For example Bitcoin ATMs can allow you to sent money to family/friends from overseas at a much lower cost than Western Union. Several services allow you to lock-in the exchange rate on both sides at the time of transfer removing the risk from volatility.
Due to fixed supply the price of Bitcoins will follow the market capitalization of the Bitcoin network. With time (several years) the market will mature and the prices will stabilize.
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:12:59
* How would the price be calculated?
Price is calculated automatically by [Bitpay](
* What are the (US) tax implications when the BTC is converted to USD? (especially if the exchange rate changes in the meantime, and especially if it drops significantly).
Merchant receives USD directly into their account from Bitpay.  There shouldn't be any special tax implications. 
* What hardware/software would they need and what if it doesn't interface with existing retail systems?
Check out  for a POS system.
* How would their customers pay using their iPhones if Apple is blocking bitcoin apps?
iPhone does have the blockchain.info bitcoin wallet app (but has also rejected a lot of apps with bitcoin).

What about a Bitcoin terminal selling gift certificates for the farmer's market?
Print a physical certificate with features (E.g. a hologram) to prevent forgery and a unique GUID to prove authenticity.  Certificates could later we redeemed for Bitcoin and/or cash.
Alternatively you need to standardize the POS system across the mall/market with a solution that accepts bitcoin.

I haven't watched the series, but it would be good to explain why Bitcoin has *intrinsic value* (beyond speculation).
In particular, Bitcoin has intrinsic value because it is **useful** as a decentralized protocol for electronic payments (just like HTTP and TCP for the Internet).  It also has other uses that I won't get into.
It gains intrinsic value through **network effects** including the **infrastructure/services** built on top of the Bitcoin network.  This is key to why many copycat alt-coins lack significant value.
An example of infrastructure would be Bitcoin ATMs that allow you to send money to family/friends overseas at a much lower cost than Western Union.
It would also be good to explain how use of the Bitcoin network will naturally increase the overall market capitalization.  Since there is a limited supply you can therefore calculate **Price = Market Cap / # Bitcoins**.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:20:59
