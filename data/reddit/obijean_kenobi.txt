I feel like a lot of what you say there is from the gift of hindsight. No-one expected this kind of adoption so quickly and the implementations werent planned for this level of surge. Fortunately, this has happened at this very early stage of adoption so the devs will be able to plan for this. 
I really dont feel it will drop as bad as you think. A general air from people ive spoken to is that the speculative value is what's fun. Lots of people with lots of reasons is a good thing!
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:52:30
And i would agree with most of what you've said there but then your question becomes something only the devs can answer. I don't know their reasoning and can only speculate toward it. I guess at current, they still see alternatives but that might change in the future.
I do agree that preventative measures have to be taken instead of waiting for bitcoin to be abandoned before implementing something. It would appear to me that they feel as though there is at least a little bit of wiggle room to get LN out before a size increase.
Personally, i only really see any cryptocurrency as a store of value currently. It's not very well integrated into day-to-day life for me to bother with it as a currency. So even with low fees it wouldnt affect me. But thats just me and i obviously dont speak for everyone. How are you using crypto atm?

That's like saying coca-cola is drunk by millions of people so why am i seeing their adds everywhere?
Thanks for the post OP, i wouldn't have seen this video otherwise and it gave me a little chuckle ��

It's an indirect good not absolute good which is what you're arguing for.
You argue that increasing the block size will provide temporary relief but it will not. It will simply fragment the community with each hard fork increase.
It is a greater good to bare high transaction fees than it is to fragment the community with hard forks. You could argue that the high fees fragment the community but that is only an ideological fragmentation as opposed to a literal seperation of ledgers. A community will more readily accept LN if they arent split into multiple hard fork currencies.
We're not saying you're wrong in that high fees suck but we are saying it's a far better solution than simply proposing block increases.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:05:41
I think you're ignoring what people are telling you.
High fees are good because it will create a unanimous adoption of the lightening network, thereby solving the issue in one fell swoop.
On the other hand, if you just keep increasing the blocksize you have to continuously hard fork the coin. This will split the user base down each time resulting in far fewer users.
On top of that, i believe if you increase the blocksize than anyone who runs nodes has to upgrade their equipment which could be an expense node runners dont want. If the nodes drop the fees will rise astronomically. (although someone with more knowledge should confirm this)
Overall, we're talking about a very delicate situation. It could either be like a snowball that gains momentum but starts falling apart or it could slow down a little before reaching a beautiful bed of soft fluffy snow to add to it.

Capitalist: "hey can you dig holes for me for the rest of your life and I'll barely pay you enough to survive"
That's still an issue. In the UK there is a push for greater adoption of the 'living wage' rather than the 'minimum wage' whilst in the USA some professions rely solely on the gratuity of their customer's tips rather than just being paid enough in the first place.

Totally rent it out and buy back into bitcoin whilst gaining financial independence
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:05:44
Literal dream haha!

No, i was hoping to have a meaningful discussion to gain better understanding rather than your vague, metaphorical and unsubstantiated answers. I'm fully aware that fiat has no value on its own and that it can be printed freely. However, in most economies and in most normal circumstances fiat is properly controlled. Nevertheless, it's quite clear I wasn't going to get valuable answers from this subreddit where everyone thinks they're an economist because they can remember a few 'facts' but cant back them up with real understanding aside from their black and white morality of the saviour of bitcoin to the terrible sins of fiat, 'may satoshi eternally guide us'

That said, it is a strong representation of the state of capitalism during the industrial revolution - what Marx was actually critiquing. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 00:23:15
Fiat money isnt literally created by thin air though. If it were than the act of printing more would not create the effects of hyperinflation. The physical note is backed by nothing however the value remains constant - hence the value of a note decreasing as more is printed.

Either you've got way too much time or you're trolling hard, man.
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:37:54
Isnt fiat backed by (albeit speculative) stocks? Bitcoins only value is its scarcity so what function would define its value?

I was interested in it when it was gpu mineable but being around 16 i wasnt geeky enough to get into it. I bought my first this summer too, sigh...
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:09:54
Woo! I just bought in another 500 eur about an hour ago. Going to be watching dilligently to see when i can invest some more
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:30:29
100k transaction backlog... So it's a bad time to buy more bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:47:39
You can buy amazon giftcards with BTC via a Bitpay wallet.
Disclosure: i haven't tested this

Woo! Another uni student here, started with 0.04 and just managed to push over 0.5 on the last big dip. Even though im now closer than ever to 1 it looks even further away than ever hahaha

I guess it's a win-win for him

You and me both! I only discovered this yesterday tbh
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:05:12


Does not seem reasonable at all
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:06:26
That makes sense, afterall we do usually learn things after they've been discovered.

Reminds me of the little girl in spiderman games who lost her balloon
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:29:27
That would make a sweet TIL because today I just learned.

In the uk there is an amount you can earn before you have to pay tax. Last time i checked it was around 10k. I dont know what country you're from but check if you have something similar. That way, so long as you withdraw below that threshold you dont need to tax at all.
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:48:41
Im pretty sure there is no law dictating a minimum age to purchase bitcoin or any altcoin. It isn't part of the stock market. Despite behaving in similar ways it is ultimately a currency.
I dont think they'll care about your original purchase. Even if they did you could tell them you didnt purchase them and they were a gift. You're not investing a lot so i cant see why they'd even notice

Im using a bitcoin.com wallet atm. I'd love to go hardware but as far as I've read they're pretty secure considering i have access to my seed words and how they automatically split funds into different sub-addresses. 
I know there are political ideas around bitcoin.com but considering i have such a small amount invested (~0.02) would the transaction fee be worth moving them to hardware?
Edit: i just did some more specific searches and I've answered my own question. Looking into moving to ethereum now
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:16:25
That's good to hear. I definitely wanted to move to hardware eventually but i wanted to have a good knowledge of what i was doing when i was doing it as opposed to rushing. 
I read a few things in the past hour about bitcoin.com moving future development toward BCH so i figure it's wise to move out of that wallet sooner than i thought. Which is a shame as the UI is really nice imo

22 y/o and i invested 0.045. Hoping to increase it through mining contracts - which is slow. I'd love to go all in with my current savings but considering I graduate this year, id like to have my savings as a cushion whilst i try and find a job. Then im all in! 
It's gonna be so painful to watch the value go up whilst i cant buy any.
