MTGOX: **SERVICE RETURN**
Service will not be back before June 20th 11:00am (JST, 02:00am GMT). This may be delayed depending on what is found during the investigation.

No shit, been trying to buy some for over a week through bitmarket.eu but their verifications process is SLOW ... which I understand but in a market like this, waiting a week is losing money!)
If anyone wants to sell BC's (for Euro's) PM me ... at this point I'm prepared to pay a premium.

I have a quetstion ...

Thanks for the invite but they are not letting me in (yet)

MagicalTux said yesterday on IRC he moved a couple 50k bitcoins to show they still have them ...
edit: also why would they (mtgox) lie about this ... it would come out when they re-open anyway.

The calacanis article -&gt;  sure helped to get my attention.

Your theory isn't right, or at least it doesn't match with the latest info from mtgox  
It would be stupid to lie about this since it will come out anyway in a day (or two)

Yeah, the way they are planning on doing this makes no sense what so ever.
Normal (logical) way:
* open mtgox to confirmed accounts
* send 24h notice to opening up trading
* open trading after the 24h have passed
MTgox way: 
* announce restart of trading in 24h while having no idea how long it will take to get all claims confirmed and or rejected.
Seriously ...

Should be in the logs somewhere ... either at day 19 or 20 @

It's not direct proof like you requested though.

That's exactly what I would like to know also.
You might be missing something but you're not the only one missing it :)
There doesn't appear to be any business model.
