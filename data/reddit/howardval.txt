For the non believers, here is a screen shot of my screen:

I hope the same.  I would definitely buy and trade the bounce.  $5K is a huge psychological level.  I'm daytrading the futures.

It's a bit optimistic.  I highly doubt crypto holders will be able to afford the cardboard and paint required for this project once the day is over.

Lighten up Francis.  I'm not wishing this on anyone.

Orange county area.  It's a huge issue there.

Why is he bummed?  Bitcoin has gone down since yesterday.  He can buy it back today for a cheaper price.  Looks like this mistake actually favors his position.  
What am I missing?

There's a saying in the stock market:  "Never try to catch a falling knife".

XBT started trading yesterday (Sunday at 6:00 pm EST) on the CBOE exchange.  BTC will start trading next week (Sunday at 6:00 pm EST) on the CME.

They don't sell wheat, gold, or oil either with their futures.  That's just how futures work!

As long as people know their chances are better in Vegas than in Bitcoin, they're fine.  It's scary when people sink too much money into it.  Good luck!

Volume is VERY low for futures traders.  And although $51M is quite a bit of money to you and I, it's VERY small if you consider futures contracts.  For example, as of this writing, Oil (CL Futures) has already traded 9,700 contracts ($55K value of each contract) and gold has traded almost 17,000 contracts ($120K/contract).  So a little over 500 contracts of the CME Bitcoin futures on it's opening night is very small.  Pretty much non-tradeable since the spreads are so high for this tiny volume.  The CBOE bitcoin futures that launched last week are at just over 1,000 contracts as of now (for today) and they represent only 1 bitcoin.

They make money off each transaction.  If there's demand for a product, they will make money off it, without risk to themselves.

If you're smart, you'll get out when you're still ahead.  If not, you'll ride this bubble down and lose not only your gains, but your capital.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:20:36
You are invested in a single crypto.  There are others.  No one can say which one will prevail 10 years from now.  Crypto was based on the belief of decentralized currency to make payments easy worldwide.  It has lost that thought.  People are now just buying for capital appreciation only.  What good is a currency that can be this volatile?  It's not for payment for goods or services any more. 
 This frenzy is a bubble.

To simplify, the bitcoin ETF (trades on the OTC markets) is way overvalued.  They have to hold the value of the underlying asset (which is bitcoin) and the value of the ETF is WAY higher than their holdings.  At some point, underlying price of the asset (bitcoin) has to match the value of the ETF holdings.  
This is generally called an arbitrage.  Citron Research is a very legitimate and respected company where they mainly specialize in seeking fraud within companies and shorting them.  
Please note:  They are NOT saying bitcoin will go higher.  They recommend buying ONLY if you short GBTC as well.  You have to take BOTH positions.  If/when the value of bitcoin drops, you will lose on your bitcoin holding, but the value of GBTC will also drop where you'll gain because you are short.  The GBTC drop will be greater in value than the drop in bitcoin, so you will still profit.

Not with a float of 21Million bitcoins.  Volatility *should* be very high with such a low float.

No, he didn't give a timeline.  As a trader, I can tell you it's really easy to spot bubbles.  What's difficult is telling how high a bubble will go and when it will burst.

You're supposed to enjoy your money while you're alive.  Can't take it with you when you die.

You know the definition of a pessimist?
A:  An experienced optimist :-)

When the price bounces up from $11K to $15K during a big crash, it's not the time to buy.  It's called a dead cat bounce.  What else do you wanna know?
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:36:16
I thought GBTC was a bitcoin ETF (or ETN).  Only issue is that it trades on the OTC (over the counter) exchange (kinda like pink sheets).  But anyone with a brokerage account that can trade stocks should be able to trade/invest in it.
Or am I missing something?

As I stated, they are shifting their primary corporate focus towards exploring blockchain.  They haven't done anything.  They have no prospects.  And I doubt they have any experience.  This is called a pump &amp; dump.

It's estimated that about 2% of all futures trades are physical delivery.  Futures contracts are mainly used for hedging by large companies and speculation by others.  So even if they change bitcoin to physical delivery, it wouldn't matter since most would cash settle anyways.
