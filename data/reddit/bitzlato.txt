Agree 100%

Amazing, maybe only with btc they can handle the company for years without any problem. Really interesting case.

I don't think so. Actually:
Ay, I wake up, I throw up, I feel like I'm dead
Just kidding, guys �� it's sunday, let's relax.
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:31:43
Very cool.

Interesting article. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2019-11-14 22:08:54
Time to go to cryptos. These guys and girls need to learn about crypto and how they can get protected against such situation when using crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:27:55
Coo, very cool.
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:08:44
Thanks for the heads up, op.
@_date: 2019-11-03 22:27:52
You still have the seeds? If so, create the wallet again.
@_date: 2019-11-14 22:16:49
You can use a p2p platform like us. Check our [**sub**]( and read our guides, in few minutes you can have your first satoshis.
@_date: 2019-11-03 22:08:51

Nice idea.
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:34:13
Interesting, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:26:21
Check with their support, I'm sure they can help you.
@_date: 2019-10-05 14:42:01
I thought you were using Raspberry Pi with some sort of screen. So it' a tablet, really cool.
@_date: 2019-10-09 22:11:37
Hmm, maybe related with the price spike?
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:59:55
Nice article, thanks for sharing. One doubt for community, anybody here knows somebody who/or was able to memorize the seed/mnemonic? Think about the electrum seed, 12 words, almost impossible to remember. It's only me or it's a general problem? I need upgrade my brain or I'm fine? =)
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:27:30
I love these old tv commercials. They show the product like if it was "another world" stuff but for us, today, it's nothing, just old, garbage (with all due respect). And the funny thing is, in the future, we will be on their shoes.
@_date: 2019-10-10 14:26:55
Hard to say, guys, but this is because... Bitcoin has died.
Just kidding ��
@_date: 2019-10-06 01:55:25
It's can happen.  I think my best lesson here on cripto market after all these years is: No expectations. If it's gonna up, if it's gonna down, who knows? Time will tell us.
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:21:55
@_date: 2019-10-06 12:00:25
Agree 100%.
@_date: 2019-10-12 12:31:31
Run a full node. You can run one with a RPi like said.
@_date: 2019-10-20 19:24:41
Cool, I liked.
@_date: 2019-10-27 13:24:40
Interesting information. In some countries $28 USD is what they make in the whole month as salary.
@_date: 2019-10-19 02:41:44
Yay ��������������
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:40:33
Decentralized exchanges like Bisq, ATM or p2p platform.
@_date: 2019-10-31 21:15:57
Nice project. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:53:53
It's depend of the risk you gonna take, I will not answer with the good fee because there's many variables on this "math". More risk, more fee, less risk, less fee. For example, Paypal and gift cards are "high risk" payment methods, in this case it's good to charge a big fee (of course if you sell for verified users with a good rating, etc, then you can charge a smaller fee). As I said it's all related with the payment method. Oh, and if you gonna sell direct (face-to-face)beware with counterfeit money. I know it's kind of "extreme" paranoia mode but it's real and it's dangerous so again, like I said, it's all depend of the buyer, his rate, his history, if he is verified and so on.
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:57:21
Very interesting anyway.
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:05:59
Thanks for share, op.
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:14:15
Unfortunately 100% you lost the coins. :(
@_date: 2019-10-16 10:38:41
Hahahaha so true.
@_date: 2019-10-09 01:56:10
hahahahaha lol.
@_date: 2019-10-12 19:13:34
You can use a p2p platform like us.
@_date: 2019-10-30 10:28:16
Gotcha, no problem :)
@_date: 2019-10-11 15:45:48
It's happen �� ... so often ��
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:28:14
Agree, let's invest NOW! We gonna list EPA on Bitzlato so everybody can invest too ��
@_date: 2019-10-12 12:33:30
Amazing, I love pixel art.
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:34:59
Here we go again... to the moon ��
@_date: 2019-10-07 09:05:00
That seems to be a good idea but there's some problems like water, fire. Maybe write in a kind of steel, don't need to be something fancy, just like a metal business card (like Steve Wozniak business card haha) with your seed on it and maybe in qr code.
@_date: 2019-10-27 13:37:53
lmao I have one of these.
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:55:34
hahahahaha omg.

@_date: 2019-10-25 12:04:24
Amazing news. And what a beautiful hotel/city.
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:35:13
Tools or exchanges?
@_date: 2019-10-06 09:55:59
Ledger and Trezor are the most famous, used and tested by community. Do a research about them.
@_date: 2019-10-27 13:36:02
Cool, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2019-10-13 11:36:24
Hahaha amazing.
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:22:58
Pretty cool and interesting.
@_date: 2019-10-06 00:27:47
Who knows? Be patient and time will tell.
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:30:48
ATM or p2p marketplaces.
@_date: 2019-10-06 10:38:37
That true
@_date: 2019-10-05 13:43:01
This is very interesting.

@_date: 2019-10-07 20:46:35
Nice, very beautiful.
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:54:54
100% true.
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:42:34
But is it possible to get Satoshi not for coins, but for plastic bottles and cans? I think this is more relevant.
@_date: 2019-09-09 19:50:36
here's how to store [

the price of gold is the price of labor spent on its extraction, it is the same bitcoin. All of them simply imposed on us that gold is a value. In fact, it is useful in small industries (medicine, electronics). We were made to believe that it is expensive and good. but it’s very difficult for them to pay, so they came up with paper money.
@_date: 2019-09-18 06:37:33
if this gold is delivered to the earth, it will be the collapse of a financial system based on the value of gold.
it’s good not to find an asteroid on which there are 500 million bitcoins
@_date: 2019-09-09 19:36:53
you're cool, this project has great potential
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:25:36
no one else believes the Fed’s words that they save us by giving money to corporations.
@_date: 2019-09-09 13:32:48
and how is the exchange rate taken? API? from which cryptocurrency exchange and how to calculate the rate for example BTC-AUD?
