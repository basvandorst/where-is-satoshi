i don't share your pessimism for bitcoin but i do agree that criticism should not be banned
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:42:11
Wow this is amazing - please bring it to Europe though!
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:44:25
I can't see it - it's blank for me?
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:49:47
Ah ok, it's just when I click on links I prefer to see the Reddit page first with the comments and then navigate to the link.  But I will try and do what you say in future.  Thanks

@_date: 2014-02-11 07:23:50
I don't like people shooting their phones, but I never liked Apple since my G4 computer broke in 2001 and they offered no support.

Multibit dev replied to me on another link and said that Multibit shouldn't suffer any problems: 
@_date: 2014-01-28 13:42:38
Sorry, I don't understand?
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:40:14

thank you never heard of the show. feel better
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:54:16
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:04:35
Can anyone explain whether I should be doing anything to my wallet to prevent a problem - I am using Multibit?
@_date: 2014-01-28 12:20:23
Yeah intermittent for me - wait.. it's back on bitcoinwisdom
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:11:51
How do you propose to single these criminals out - will it be a fair process?  Also, I am a bit scared of these 'consequences' too in that I believe even evil should be countered with understanding and compassion.
@_date: 2014-01-28 13:30:34
What a horrible article
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:05:33
i really enjoyed this.. thanks for the link
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:01:20
yes that's the one. same here
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:49:56
Just on the off chance you are still reading, how does the Multibit client fare with this transaction malleability issue that is occurring? - I don't understand it but I am seeing double transactions a lot of late. Thank you for any reply
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:06:56
As a hypothetical: today I withdrew from BTC-E and in my wallet the transaction showed up twice with different IDs.  The balance was therefore overstated.  If I had tried to spend this extra coinage, what would have happened?  By the way, as soon as one of the transactions confirmed, the other one disappeared.  Thanks
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:07:29
blocked request?
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:15:04
Yeah I wonder if they even mention 
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:46:45
back up
@_date: 2014-02-11 10:41:12
I like Bitcoins to accept micro-payments on my website.  I also accept Paypal but they hit me with plenty fees.  This is what makes Bitcoin attractive to me. However at the moment, redeeming those Bitcoins for cash costs due to the exchanges (although increase in value has countered that), but I am hoping that as others accept Bitcoin, this will become a problem of the past
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:45:01
Thanks for this post..  Thanks to Bitcoin I have:
- found out that Reddit existed and signed up
- learnt about chart candles for the first time
- felt like a forex trader boss (tiny barrier to entry for small time player in crypto made it possible - unlike fiat forex)
- enabled Bitcoin donations on a website
- looked into cryptography, maths, prime numbers
- looked at the nature of contracts (ethereum, protoshares, mastercoin)
- learnt to never invest more than you can afford to loose
- much much more..
This post gave me the inspiration to look back at all this, and realise it.  So thanks again
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:02:02
Thank you very much for getting back to me - you are very kind.. All the best!
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:03:01
Haha! Cool, they are not all bad, fair play
