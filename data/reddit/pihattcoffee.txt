No, it is only available for this community since it must be paid using bitcoin

Shipping will be dependent on a third party such as USPS, UPS, Fedex... the price for that is beyond our control.
The shipping price that you see on our website is already lower than the price you can get by getting a quote from those shipping companies

I corrected the post. No coupon code is needed.

Hi, free shipping will only be applied to orders  shipped in the US. International shipping rate will be higher. However, please order and send me a PM. I will give you a significant refund on your shipping.

Got it. Thanks. I will be sending you a surprise gift with your order. You should be getting your order some time next week.

You no longer need a coupon code. The discount will be given when you pay with Bitcoin. It will be displayed on the total amount.

Due to the regulations in Viet Nam, we are not allowed to take bitcoin payments there. 
You are welcome to purchase and buy through our web store and pick it up locally in Viet  Nam.

You don't need a coupon code anymore. You can order directly from the site and the 5% discount will be given when going through the checkout process on Coinbase.
