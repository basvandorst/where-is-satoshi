Krugman doesn't care about your ideology. 
To him, finite is a weakness - it removes the option of monetary stimulus, and being a Keynesian he is a believer in that approach (as are most economically literate people). Finite is counter to any currency ever known, and hard to predict exactly how it would function as a primary currency.
Lack of central authority is the same - how do we tax and spend, or regulate? Takes away both monetary and fiscal options for controlling the economy.
I'm sure you believe it is very simple and everything would with well without central banks, but the central bank was created to provide economic stability - and it generally works very well. Krugman just doesn't understand how the system would work otherwise.

If the rent is paid in dollars then it is never in Bitcoin. You never know that you can pay the rent until you trade your Bitcoin for dollars - until then it's just a promise.
You should have signed a Bitcoin lease instead of a dollar lease.

You buy from other people on all the exchanges. That's why they are "exchanges" - a place to exchange with other people.

I don't think the "100% Bitcoin" crowd really think about things in that way, i.e. thoroughly.
@_date: 2017-02-11 03:37:42
Isn't the logical thing to just own both? That's the technical result of a fork - you now own coins on two blockchains. Maybe one of those chains eventually becomes worthless, maybe not.

Only an idiot would think that the increments have anything to do with percentage change.
The problem is that the axes are not zero bounded. Only an idiot wouldn't know that.
Again, as presented and in isolation, this implies a similar increase (percentage-wise) between the two. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:26:25
What can you buy with Bitcoin that doesn't involve either intermediary conversion to dollars, or the seller converting to dollars immediately after the sale?
@_date: 2017-02-11 03:35:25
No - it's not a way to buy Bitcoin. It's buying a share in a big stash of Bitcoin. If you buy, you buy from an existing owner who wants to sell.

Oh okay then.
I'm impressed that this is an article about an article about an article where a guy predicts a price out of thin air based solely on the fact that Bitcoin has a limited supply.

Demonstrated by the increasing legalization of marijuana, I suppose?
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:58:00
There may be an impromptu leader, but it's still a leader nonetheless. Someone who suggests the next idea or initiates is a leader. Someone who has the tie breaking vote can be the leader. Someone who disregards the group and just starts doing something can be a leader.
If there's no designated leader, and in a large group, the strong, motivated, and/or greedy become the leaders.
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:58:56
It's more misleading than complicated. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 12:56:15
I guess that's why no one is using it, then.
The real selling angle is lower transaction cost, faster processing (or at least there once was), and programmability or automation (triggered events).
All the rest is just political BS.
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:30:50
Bitcoin always pulled in the libertarian crowd. Nothing new.

All the Bitcoin are currently owned by Winklebros. People can buy from the Winklebros, and also sell. When the Winklebros don't want to sell any more then people will buy from the earlier people who bought from Winklebros.
There's a finite number of coins. It's an ETF, not a Bitcoin purchasing system.
Think of it like a condo building. When people buy a condo they don't add another floor - they are buying from someone else who wants to sell.

If you're depending on people "believing in Bitcoin" in order for it to be successful you've got a long painful road in front of you. There's got to be some real benefit to the user and merchant.

No? How many megabytes, then?
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:16:49
 it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data.
We're talking about a few megabytes, right?
Why is this an issue? A block every 10 minutes, or 600 seconds. Even the slowest connection that takes a full 6 seconds to get the block is only losing 1%. Most are going to get it in well under a second, which is a fraction of a percent.

You've got to borrow money to make money. Borrowing for a house, at under 4%, will result in mortgage payments that are substantially lower than the rent on an equivalent property.  You get the tax benefit of home ownership and the growing equity in a valuable asset.
Of course you need to keep some savings in case of emergency, but this is a good plan.

You implied that mining wouldn't be economically viable if the price dropped, which isn't true.
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:53:04
The safest is simply to hold until you want to sell, i.e. don't trade.

No, but Bitcoin doesn't ensure its own success. The competence of it's subscribers does. Removing the edgelord and extremists, or at least overshadowing their screechy voices with sanity, is essential for success.

What an assertion. 
So wrong. 
2^256 is around 1.15 * 10^77, per Google - the number of SHA256 hashes.
There are 2^160 possible Bitcoin addresses. That's 1.46*10^48.
There are between 10^78 and 10^82 atoms in the *known and observable* universe. 
There isn't even one atom per Bitcoin address. Not even close.

A blurry image? 
But seriously, what does that even mean? What is "the minimum theoretical amount of energy to change a bit from 0 to 1"? That would by definition be the smallest measurable amount of energy. 
If you had a sensitive enough computer working at absolute zero you could do it with a single joule of energy.

Just to address the comment about failure of socialist republics, don't you think that all "republics" will fail eventually, regardless of political leaning? They fail or they are "about to fail" like most at the moment.

WTF. Why not just imagine someone gives you free money to buy Bitcoin. They don't give those rates to just anyone; you need to be an amazing risk. 
But if you want to borrow money you should be able to get a personal loan well under 10%, just put it into Bitcoin and start writing checks, amirite? I assume you're fully loaded up.

You're backwards.
You can buy Bitcoin at a percentage fee, e.g. Coinbase will charge you 1.49%. If you want to buy stocks, you have a flat fee of at least $7.
If you buy and sell $10 of Bitcoin, you'll spend under $0.50. Do the same with stocks and you'll have spent $14.

That's not what trustless means. It's not that you can't trust authorities, it's that you can't trust (remotely) that they are who they say they are. And you can't trust some random guy actual sent some money when he said he did, and he can't trust that you didn't receive it when you say you didn't.
Trustless doesn't mean I don't trust the government or a bank. It means that the Two Generals Problem isn't a real problem anymore.

Firstly we will not see three to four equal chains. We might see two or three competing chains for a while, but come end of year (at the latest) one will dominate and the others will become minor altcoins. The investment in Bitcoin will converge.
Secondly, this split is entirely Bitcoin-driven. It's not caused by outside forces. It's ego and politics; juvenile behavior which should be easily resolved.
Finally, if "someone" wanted to devalue Bitcoin who would that be, and what's the motive? How are they going to stop ETH and LTC and XMR?
