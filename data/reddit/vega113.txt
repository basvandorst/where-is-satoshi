You got to be miner to exploit this bug. And miners have incentives to keep the network up and running and the btc price as high as possible.

segwit incentivizes batching and thus promotes efficiency. also segwit transactions are in fact smaller with bech transactions are even smaller that those that start with 3.

I use bitcoin for donations - a few times per month.
Also, I bought a few games on steam with bitcoin. And whenever its value goes up - I buy some gold on goldmoney.com and vaultoro.com.
So, I do use bitcoin - and it get a great value out of it. Bitcoin allows me to hedge the economical risks like anything else. 
However, the current bitcoin value didn't came as result of organic growth in the West, but as reaction to insane monetary policy by central banks. China, India and Venezuela - people get aware that can stop being financially repressed by using bitcoin. I think in the near future bitcoin adoption will be driven by central bankers policies.

No, softfork is backward compatible. If there would be miners mining with old rules - they would fork of. There would be two chains now. However, with SegWit - even if some miners do not upgrade they would still be on the same chain (might experience re-orgs in case they mine segwit transactions whithout witness validation), because segwit is softfork and is backward compatible.

Previously valid transactions/blocks were made invalid. This is called hardfork. Off course once the consensus rules were changed and newly invalid blocks were re-orged - you can sync the new version of blockchain even with an old client, but the old client could also accept currently invalid transactions.

Ok, according to your logic, when ETH bailed out DAO hack - it was a softfork. Is it right?
The issue here is that the change was retroactive. Softfork is not supposed to make re-orgs to historical transactions. 
Anyway, if retroactivity is not part of the definition, then I must admit it was a softfork.
