I'd love to file a trademark invalidation, but it currently costs £200

Very interesting.
How the hell did he get the trademark for WESTWORLD!

Thank you, will do!

Thanks for the info! This is all very new to me so if you do contact the IPO it would be much appreciated!

Oh yes I've a few unfair strikes, what is more annoying is they don't give you a chance to defend yourself. Funny thing is I received this letter but they didn't bother to report the shirts to Etsy, which just makes me think they're after money, not protecting "their brand".
