Jesus that guy could have been killed
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:07:15
I think he means everyone who said it will be dead in 2015 probably have btc now. Anyway what percent of population has gold? Probably not a lot either. I can see Bitcoin be becoming more popular and convenient

Overused stupid meme
@_date: 2019-06-07 05:37:43

@_date: 2019-06-02 21:18:24

@_date: 2019-04-24 01:08:41

@_date: 2019-04-25 22:46:02
Bogdanov made a call. He said "dump it"
@_date: 2019-04-18 23:59:17
Is Bitcoin more popular in Japan? Why don't they use it in stores yet
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:44:30
Lol this is probably the best meme I've seen . There is definitely some truth to it 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:37:23
load ze korean fud. sideways until he sleeps then pamp it
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:14:17
Put him to sleep, load the Japanese FUD.
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:42:06
i dont even understand what does this even mean? good or bad?
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:33:14
WTF.. lol. how?
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:02:29
Are you high?
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:21:04
Not sure..  I only recently started browsing the reddit and reading up news about it. So i'm probably the wrong person to ask. Probably there will be more actual things to buy with it later on but the fees seem too high at the moment. maybe instead of cash its more like digital gold
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:55:03

Dead meme 
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:19:41
I dont understand, who is this guy and who is the creator of bitcoin? people saying its not satoshi?
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:34:24
And also for training your hand muscles .. All that lifting
@_date: 2019-09-14 03:22:21
I love this picture for some reason. But I would probably hate to be in it or live like that
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:43:43
Lol luxury with $25 ? In best case senario he might make $50 or $100 out of it  maybe in a few years, how is that going to change anything? It's just funny to me when people make posts about buying ~$30 worth of bitcoin like its a big deal and get lots of upvotes 
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:49:08
i remember using pretty sure this exact same phone.. maybe 15 years ago 
@_date: 2017-07-06 02:32:06
is this real? how much power does it give and what speed can u mine at
@_date: 2019-05-03 05:49:46
Ok but where do you keep that gold? And how do u transfer it? With Bitcoin it takes only one click. And it will also go up in price over time more than gold. Everyone has electricity and Internetv these days. It's no problem
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:22:17
You know that's a pussy move to do that from behind
@_date: 2019-05-02 04:51:39
But why??
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:27:04
Don't be too confident in yourself . You never know they might be right
