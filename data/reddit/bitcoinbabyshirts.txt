I made this for myself - have been wearing it around town, but nobody has asked me about it yet. Was thinking other people into btc might like the design, would love some feedback!

Hey I could actually make these (or at least shirts) if you promised to buy one :)

Yeah. I'm convinced these guys think of "blockchain" as little more than a magic problem solving future-tech buzzword. Unfortunately your average person is not really educated on cryptocurrencies enough to understand what's going on or what a blockchain IS. I'm guessing we're going to see a bank-sponsored coin before too long. Perhaps it's just another way to motivate people to stop using greenbacks. They've been wanting to move people away from physical cash for years - if people have all their money in a centralized bank-controlled coin (and can't exchange it for physical dollars), it's possible to implement very nasty things (like negative interest rates) and force people to just accept it.

Banking industry CEOs and (and individual governments, to a far lesser degree) are made obsolete by Bitcoin on a long enough timeline. I'm just surprised it's happening so quickly! Awesome stuff.

That's really cool! As neat as it is when your favorite cafe starts accepting bitcoins, it somehow seems a lot more exciting to be able to pay for larger-scale purchases in btc, such as your new laptop. I'm excited for the time when cars, houses, and land are regularly exchanged using the currency.
