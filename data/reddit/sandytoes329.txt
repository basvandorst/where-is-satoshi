Why assume I don’t work too? I said I switched jobs I didn’t lose my job or do not have a job. I make half than I did before but I still have a job. This is going soooooo off topic. I just asked for a link and helpful advice on how to be able to get my presents for her.

Yeah she does ☺️☺️ She’s my everything the first year we were together I took her to little harbor and out to dinner and bought her a camera cause she loves taking pictures of everything. Then the second year I took her out to the beach and wrote in really big words I love you Hailey, Happy 2 Years&lt;3 In the sand and paid for a helicopter tour of the beach. So I could show her what I wrote :-3 But there was too many people walking on the beach and disrespecting what I wrote... you could barely see it. She still loved the fact that I tried :) It’s been a rough year to be honest. Switched jobs moved from our house to an apartment. Just had a repo on my car last month. I know things will get better just shitty timing.

What’s that?

All I’m asking for is a link to earn bitcoin. Surveys or task or anything. I’m not gonna pour my life story on reddit. My bank is fine and I’m getting paid on Friday so I’m not worrying about my bank. I can buy her flowers and that teddy bear Friday but it’s just not the same as on anniversary day. Now why assume I need food? Or worry about my bank account? I just have no money until Friday and asked for help from someone to direct me to a link to actually make some bitcoin so I can buy what I wanna buy for her before tomorrow.
