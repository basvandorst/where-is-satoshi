Why do you want to wait for 0.25? 
Keep buying small amounts at regular intervals.

But the red pill doesn't say that you go back to the time when you were 10 years old. It says that you restart your life with all you knowledge now with an age of 10. There's a difference.

It's not the storage. It's the network bandwidth.

Interesting. I could actually run a pruned node but not a 160 (or thereabouts) GB node. 
Would it still validate and function as a full node ? 
I would love to run such a full node.

What's the size of download needed to get the Bitcoin core wallet to sync fully? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:44:22
And do check if there's any trash folder of the cloud service.

Thanks for your reply. 
I wanted to run a full node myself to show my support but couldn't due to the high size of the blockchain. This reply tells me I can still support the network.
