Is this true?  You can't liquidate bitcoin?  Aren't people worried that this means the exchanges have liquidity problems and that they will never see their deposits? Doesn't this artificially inflate the price of bitcoin due to an artificially small float?

My point is the fact that it is being run off of 10000 times what it needs to be is disgraceful and a waste of energy.  
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:57:51
If you have any money in bitcoin, you need to completely understand it.  Essentially, fake liquidity is being pumped into buying BTC, artificially inflating its price. Just like a ponzi scheme, there isn't close to enough liquidity or real demand to account for people trying to sell. "HODL" is the only thing keeping bitcoin from crashing.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:04:48
This is a great question. Another good question is how much total fiat has been put into buying bitcoin and how has that rate changed over time.

It is a huge thing to worry about. The value of Bitcoin currently is as much of a fraud as the value of bitconnect coins were a couple weeks ago. It's a matter of time before it crashes to 10-20 fold
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:58:35
The idea that you shouldn't invest more than you can afford to lose makes no sense.  A good investment strategy protects your capital in such a way that if you do lose money, you won't lose it all.  What you are describing is gambling.  Don't put more money on a race horse than you can afford to lose would make sense. 
As for regulation.  If you live in the U.S., bitcoin is already regulated by the SEC.  If you sell, you pay taxes.  If you participate in a pump and dump, you face legal repercussions. If you profit from a ponzi scheme, you face legal repercussions. 
Also, the stock market is absolutely accessible to lower/middle class people.  I have made significant "gains" despite a very modest income simply by being frugal and indexing. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:02:32
This is just like the bitconnect "victims."  They are happy to ignore the fraud because they think they can profit from it. I can't tell you how many times people were saying the burden of proof was on us to prove that bitconnect was a ponzi.  Really, the burden of proof is on the financial institution to prove through audits that they are not fraudulent. I am getting commercials now about "bitcoin IRAs."  This is a freaking disaster.

Is this fund giving you the option to buy at the price of 9 years ago?  Investments are about increasing future value, not picking something that has already increased in value. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:15:58
The problem for people speculating on the price continuing to increase is that because of the small float, it is possible that bitcoin is actually highly leveraged.  That means that your 100M may not have been bought for 100M and was actually just bought with 5M X 20 leverage.  In other words, the price is inflated by the speculation and there isn't enough liquidity in the system to pay you your money.
This is what happened with the investment banks during financial crisis..They were so highly leveraged that they did not have the liquidity to pay. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:54:42
You are vastly overestimating the amount of money people are putting into crypto.  Not 200M in a single day, that's for sure.  Why 200M tethers printed as the price was crashing earlier this week?  Shouldn't people have been cashing out and the # of tethers decreasing?
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:38:10
A good retirement account will shift from stocks to bonds as you get older.  Also, the stock market has recovered since the 08 crash. When you own a stock, you own a share of a company and are paid a dividend.  Even with the devastating 08 crash, the market dropped about 50 percent..That happens all the time in crypto.
Do the people who approved of this nonsense even know about tether pumping up the crypto prices?  It's one thing if it's random people losing their beer money, but it's entirely different when people are putting their retirement money into this crap.

You're right.  It would have been better to say that the value of bitcoin is fraudulent rather than the system itself. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:05:48
The problem is that the price is inflated from the 1.7B fake tethers.  So if you don't care about the value of bitcoin in USD, then you're right.  I do respect the people who are in it for the system and don't care about the relative value in USD.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:10:19
It all depends on who these people are.  From the looks of it, the majority of bitcoin "investors" that utilize this strategy have really poor credit to begin with and wouldn't have the credit rating to get more than a couple thousand on a cc. Defaulting at this scale happens all the time. 
The problem with the housing crisis was that these same fools were getting 6 figure loans because the assumption was they wouldn't default on a house. Defaulting on a 6 figure loan is a much bigger problem for a bank than a couple thousand cc.  
That's what I hope at least.  If IBs are secretly leveraged in bitcoin or people actually are mortgaging their houses for it, that would be a really big problem when the crash happens.  I think the gains in the stock market have been due to the corporate tax cuts more than anything else, meaning I don't think they are fueled by bitcoin, and I don't think a bitcoin crash will effect them.

How is the carbon footprint if you compare on a per transaction basis? The traditional financial system processes more transactions by many orders of magnitude. For the future of the planet, I think it's important to change the current system of mining.  That, or western countries need to ban cryptocurrencies that utilize these inefficient means of mining.  It's like lighting pools of gasoline on fire.

The present existence of bitcoin (and its existence for the past couple of years) as a speculative "asset" that is only held because it is thought to undoubtedly appreciate in value goes against everything the currency is meant to be.  It should be an anonymous means of transaction independent from the central banking system and immune to inflation. 
However, it has run into problems of scalability.  
Furthermore, it should be clear to everyone with the amount of pump and dumping/wash trading/spoofing endemic in the market that some level of regulation is necessary.  Lastly, the process of mining is an extraordinarily disgraceful waste of both computing power and electricity. 
The entire crypto market is going to crash, as happened during the .com bubble in the 2000s.  From there, only a couple feasible currencies will be left standing (i.e. whatever is the google or amazon of crypto). I don't think it will be bitcoin because of the scalability issues (they will be the AOL). Just as the .com crash was necessary in the evolution of the internet, so will the forthcoming crypto crash in the evolution of cryptocurrency.

How has bitcoin produced profit and what is the vehicle by which that profit is transferred to those who own bitcoin?
The reason that this is exactly like the .com bubble is because there are endless ICOs that are simply pump and dump scheme.  This is almost identical to what happened with the .com IPOs that were meant simply to get $$ from the public offering. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:27:50
I don't think people buying, holding, and refusing to utilize bitcoin as a currency helps the platform at all.  The entire purpose is to replace fiat.  The people hurting the price are the speculators, pumpers, ICOs, and those advocating for "holding on."  
Bitcoin is not meant to be an investment.  It's meant to be a monetary system that can't be manipulated by governments. 
The people who work on wall street would be happy to sell bitcoin to investors if they could earn commission based off of it.  They'd sell cryptocurrency securities if they could earn a fee.  However, they aren't going to "invest" their bonus checks in a cryptocurrency that is as likely to be worth 1/2 of what it is today as it is to be worth 2X.  They can do that in vegas.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:32:52

@_date: 2018-01-14 06:55:22
If the liquidity in the entire system is suspect, why would anybody put any $$ into bitcoin? A relatively small group of people could purchase short interest on the CME or CBOE and then crash the entire system by having a number of shell accounts hit their withdrawal limits. This is how people have shorted currencies in the past...by testing their liquidity.  Unlike a pump and dump, it is actually legal to do this.  
Hmm...I wonder if the outage at Kraken was due to liquidity problems.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:25:54
The force driving down the price should be capital flight.  Net $$$ being pumped into the system should result in the price increasing.  The Number of tethers should have dropped dramatically during the crash as people redeemed them for fiat.

It would be an absolute disaster.  Because people would have less discretionary income, they would be less likely to buy bitcoin.  Others would have to sell their bitcoin to pay debts/losses. A market crash brings down the entire market for reasons such as these.  
What you need to hope for if you want bitcoin to be worth more money is a financial crisis unlike that of 2007, but one entirely based on some type of armageddon scenario where fiat is worthless and we live in a world where everyone stores their value on usb drives/computers not connected to the internet.

Fraudulent paper work is against the law, and if charities are caught being scams, their accounts are frozen.

I'll explain it to you.  
If there are 10 shares of a company, and the company pays a total of 10 dollars worth of dividends, everyone with a share gets 1 dollar.  
Lets say the company is sitting on some extra money.  They have two ways to return that money to their investors. 
1.  Pay more dividends. 
2.  They can buy back some shares.  
Lets say they do option 2 and they buy back 5 of those shares.  Now the next time the company pays a dividend, it will only be divided 5 ways instead of 10.  So if they pay 10 dollars worth of dividends, everyone gets 2 dollars instead of 1. Because of this fact, that now every remaining share is worth a larger % of the company than before (and therefore will receive a higher dividend), the price of the shares goes up.  
The question then becomes, which is the better means to return money to the shareholder?  Stock buyback or dividend payment?  The answer is that if the management think the price of the stock does not reflect the present + future value of the company, they should go with the stock buyback.  The reason is they would in effect be buying the stock at a discount.  
I hope I've cleared things up for you.

A stock buyback is a way of increasing the dividend per share for the shareholder.  They use this strategy if they think the price of the company is undervalued.  The point of a company isn't to increase wages, it's to provide profit for its capital investors.  
Bitcoin provides no profit or its investors and doesn't employ anyone/pay wages.

Holding your own money clearly isn't easy.  Just look at the OP.  Banks take a lot of precautions to safeguard their funds.  And the idea of putting all your money onto a trezor is insane (in my opinion).  I much prefer to have it in a bank where it is guaranteed by FDIC and in mutual funds, where I am investing in the world economy and am protected from theft (although not investment loss). 
I know many doctors that are completely incapable of being their own bank (actually probably all of them that I know shouldn't be their own bank).

I don't see why you need immediate liquidity for something you plan to buy and hold long term.  It's not as if the index fund is as illiquid as property.  You can sell it and get paid relatively quickly. 
I looked into this some more and found out that an advantage with owning the index fund itself is that you can reinvest dividends with no fees, while ETFs require the purchase of additional shares.  I think that really adds up over a number of years.

Impact factor is the easiest but not always a great measure. Some legitimate journals have very low impact factors. The best way is to go through the journals one by one unfortunately. A prof used to keep a list of predatory journals online, but I think he stopped because of lawsuits from them. Maybe you can still find it or somebody else picked up in his wake. 
I also think there are some legitimate journals that publish crap. For example, I’d say a good number of papers in scientific reports, despite being owned by nature publishing groups, are actually crap. On the other hand, almost everything in most of their other journals is legitimate. I don’t classify all open access as crap though-lots of good studies and up in elife or plos biology.

Why would you buy an ETF and not just the actual index fund? With Vanguard admiral shares you pay essentially no fees.  I agree that your main investment should be indexed stocks, but owning a house is great to couple with this.  
Yes land has additional costs, but it also does keep you from having to pay rent.  There are also a number of tax advantages with home ownership (e.g. being able to sell your house and buy another without paying capital gains tax).

I just don't see what's wrong with keeping your money in a Bank.  I've done so for years and have never had money stolen. In fact, all of my money is guaranteed by the U.S. government. I spend money on a credit card and pay it at the end of the month.  I don't pay any fees..In fact they give me a % back with each purchase.  There are ATMs everywhere for me to withdraw cash and spend if I don't feel like using the card.  I also have an apple wallet on my phone, so sometimes I use my phone to buy things that way.  
Do I think investment banks like Goldman have issues?  Absolutely.  But I don't see what's so evil about traditional banks and credit unions.  
I think most people who buy bitcoin aren't doing it to be their own bank.  They're doing it hoping the value will go up and they will become rich.  You clearly are an exception that wants to bank yourself, but I think it's a problem that most are trying to get rich quickly instead of thinking like you.  The result is that when the price crashes from the get rich quickers dumping, it will negatively impact you as well.

The only way tether can be created is if somebody hands Tether Co a USD and in turn gets a USDT.  When the price of bitcoin is falling, that means people are selling bitcoin for either USD or USDT. It makes no sense for more tethers to be issued in this circumstance.  If anything, they should be getting redeemed, which we actually saw happen over the past couple of weeks after the investigation was revealed.

Credit card companies give points to responsible americans who use credit cards.  So we essentially get a small bonus for using credit instead of debit.  The reason they do this is so that they can seriously fuck over the irresponsible americans who buy things with credit that they can't afford to pay back in the same month. If they didn't have the responsible ones, they would get a lot more scrutiny, as their entire business would be getting idiots into debt and then essentially owning them through outrageous interest (much like the mafia).

Bitfinex was inflating the price by printing tethers and driving up demand on all of the exchanges.  Now they have to buy back USDT to maintain their peg because nobody believes that they have 1:1 USDT/USD backing anymore. At a certain point, they are going to give up or become insolvent.  At that point, tether collapses and there will be a panic sell and no fake currency to keep it artificially propped up.

I just find it highly unlikely that 800M USD went into bitfinex when they can't bank in the U.S. Also, they are selling their bitcoins to buy back USDT...If they had 800M USD, they could use that to buy back this first wave (400M so far) instead of selling BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:38:18
You think there is an equal chance of BTC hitting 900 as it hitting 340,000. You could therefore easily set up a trade where I am selling you call options at 340K and buying put options from you at 900.  If the price stays within that range, we both break even.  If it drops below 900, I make money.  If it goes above 340K, you make money.  Based on what you just said, you'd make that trade. 
What I am saying is that I would put down a ton of money in that scenario because I think there is a very good chance the price drops below 900, while a next to 0 chance it goes above 340K.  Unfortunately, there is no way for us to do this trade reliably.

It's hypocritical.  He goes after the easy targets:  "Cryptonick" and "Tai Lopez," but refuses to address and even contributes to the bigger problem in crypto.  That problem is people thinking they can make a fortune through speculation alone.  He lists altcoins that he thinks are going to go up--altcoins that he owns and will therefore profit from his viewers buying.  He also has suggested somebody putting 10-50% of one's assets in crypto is a good idea, when in fact it is grossly irresponsible. 
Worst of all, he took forever to address the tether scam, and when he finally did, he essentially swept it under the rug.  I'm paraphrasing, but he said something along the lines of that it could be a scam, but it's not entirely clear whether or not it is, and even if it is it won't have a gigantic effect on the market. 
In reality, anyone with a basic understanding of economics can see how irresponsible it is to advocate investing in speculation fueled bubbles.  Furthermore, it is obvious that despite Tether's 2B market cap, its collapse would result in the collapse of the bitcoin market cap.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:49:23
This is literally how the vast majority of people use credit cards.  I buy everything with mine and pay it off every month.  This isn't the reason they are banning it.

I got the 400M number because i've been watching this wallet:  
It seems they are funneling money into it as they are buying back.  A couple days ago it got to 200M and they moved it somewhere else.  Now it is back to 200M.

If you believe tether to be insolvent, they have been artificially inflating the price of BTC.  Its collapse would remove buy-side pressure and wipe out most of the value of BTC (and all other cryptocurrencies) in the process.

Dollars are not physically backed by anything, but to live or do business in the United States, you must utilize dollars. Because taxes have to be paid in USD, there is inherent value in USD...That value is based on whether people want to live/work in the U.S. 
What is bitcoin currently used for?  That determines whether or not it has value.  Right now, its main use is a speculative asset that fools think will make them millionaires.  Maybe at some point in the future it will actually have some other use that overtakes its use in speculation, but until that day comes, it is not worth holding. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:31:51
The way finance works is that the burden of proof is on the financial institution/company to prove they have the assets that they claim.  That's why companies are subject to third party audits.  If an auditing firm screws that process up, it pays a huge price.  You don't just take a company at its word for their number-nobody in their right mind would say, "well you can't prove that we DON'T have 2B dollars."  No, it is up to them to prove that they DO have the money. The people who choose to take them at their word are the same types who took bitconnect at their word-it's the same scam in different form ("You can't prove that they're a ponzi scheme" is what I was told then too). 
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:59:01
You're right that this type of chart extrapolation is complete BS. It's much more reasonable to utilize the inherent value of assets as a guide to their price. Simply calculate the value of bitcoin by determining the amount it will return per unit (in dividends, rent, interest, etc) over the course of the next (give or take) 50 years.

That’s nonsense. Inflation doesn’t cause the price of bitcoin to drastically go up. It goes up the same as everything else does relating to an inflationary dollar.

@_date: 2018-04-02 20:30:49

@_date: 2018-04-02 20:09:20
Yes it is. A stock is a piece of a company, and the mechanism by which companies return value to investors is through dividend payments (or selling the company, which is essentially a single large dividend payment). By Amazon stock today, you are doing so with the expectation that its earnings will significantly increase in the future and eventually pay a large dividend (or be bought out by an even larger company). 
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:18:03

@_date: 2018-04-02 20:14:06
I'm talking about valuing a company.  It doesn't need to pay a dividend to make you money, but the value of the stock is determined by its present and future expected dividend payments.  Read about value investing instead of bitcoin.  
See the following link: 
"Even if a company does not pay a dividend right now, the price of its stock is calculated under the assumption that at some point in time the company will begin paying one. If there is no hope of ever getting money back, investors would have no reason to buy a stock. It would be worth nothing."
At no point will bitcoin ever present a dividend/payout, and unlike gold, it has no intrinsic value.  It currently only has value because of speculation and likely market manipulation.

There is no chance it becomes a world currency.  If there were  a world currency, it would be centrally regulated and transitioned at fixed exchange rates (in the same manner that Europe switched to the Euro).  Bitcoin is not something that is worth holding onto long term.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:02:22
At the end of the day, you're still investing in a company that at some point will need to return capital to investors. Holding companies like Berkshire can keep reinvesting, but companies like Amazon at some point have to pay a dividend. 
Also, Amazon has a very high P/E ratio, so it's not exactly reinvesting all of its earnings..It just doesn't have much profit (in relation to its market cap) because its driving everyone else out of business first.  
Eventually they still start paying huge dividends though..Otherwise there'd be no reason to own the stock. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:50:34
You just described an investment. Unless you're already a multi millionaire (liquid, not talking property holdings), dropping 12K on bitcoin as an investment is a gross mismanagement of money.  
Bitcoin isn't something that's going to make you money as an investment.  The sooner people realize that the better.
