Your friend is actually right. If cryptos were decent value investment, smart money would have bought it up long time ago. They are not even close to value investment, just a speculation that has done INSANELY well recently.
It takes skill to invest in right things indeed, which you and most cryptocurrency "investors" most likely don't have.
Disclaimer: I'm holding some coins myself and love the idea of cryptos, just sad to see uneducated "investors" giving out crappy recommendations when they most likely know nothing about economy or investing.

Hedge funds make money by investing their clients money and taking a cut of profits (usually yearly, I believe). Cryptos have got alot of media exposure recently so there is probably plenty of demand for hedge funds that offer cryptos. They don't need to do well long-term to make money. For example, if a hedge fund takes 3% commission of profits per year, it is extremely good for them to have risky, swingy investments in portfolio. On a good year they make +100% and get a decent cut, on a bad year they lose -75% and don't have to pay customers back anything.
I wouldn't necessarily equate hedge funds with smart money. Most of these are just salesmen trying to get customers and their commission and don't beat the markets.

I don't know about technology but it works exactly like stand-alone Google Authenticator.

Do they offer real estate loans with very low interest rates (less than 5%) for long periods (30 years)? Running an usual credit card type interest rate business is easy, but pretty much no person or business besides banks are going to loan money out with as low interest as you get on house loans.

Oh it is? Where do I submit my house loan application?
