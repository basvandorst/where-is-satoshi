so violinmakers are a "old world" type...I tried to introduce them to the concept of accepting it, didn't seem to go over too well. It's an entertaining read, and well, an idea of what we are up against related to adoption, it was like trying to explain the world is round to flat earthers. ugh! Thank god I make guitars too!

Well, I don't think people are that into it to "invade" the forum, I would delete it all if it that happens, really I'm just trying to help, them by trying to get them to accept it, and "you" by showing you the resistance that will be met by "regular" people.
I am sure that the larger auction houses that deal with high end instruments will be the first to adopt bitcoin, once that happens, they will sing a different tune

Hmm, I'll keep that in mind, I'm sure bitpay is more than willing to give these flat earthers their "money" hahaha

well, nothing, I don't know why is problem, what are people going to register to a violin site and go "fuck you use bitcoin?", no... it just shows you that when you present these ideas to "normal" not on reddit into bitcoin people they are resistant. I think if for anything it is for reddit bitcoiners to understand that even if it is gaining popularity there is still a long way to go for complete assimilation...I'm not trying to bash anyone, most of those guys are friends, maybe like I say, more for bitcoin people, as education of what challenges are to come...to me it's lead, bitcoin, or get out of the way, ha

I know, I'm just trying to help them. funny thing is, two of those guys that are giving me a hard time, are two of the smartest guys in the world. Lots of smart guys make violin for hobby, One of those guys is the premire telescope lens maker and world famous astronomer, and the other guy is the former head of nasa mars rover project, geesh'
