I'd like to have the Bitcoin CEO's opinion on this.

We appreciate the hard work of you and your team! All CEOs can learn from you.

No, I meant the iOS app.

Bitcoin is not to be confused with Bitcorn.

Yeah, but bitcoin VC is in a way earlier stage of development than VC for internet startups in general.
The State of Bitcoin report shows that the total VC invested in bitcoin companies so far is surpassing internet startup VC from 1995, with the assumption being that we're in the first few years of bitcoin's development, with a 10-20 year timeframe for any technology to become mainstream.

Thanks, we'll take that into consideration - hopefully we'll get something on it in the next report.

Good to see it on Preev too, sir! We love the Preev design over at CoinDesk.

Is Bitcoin CEO going to weigh in on the reason for this?
@_date: 2014-06-19 08:10:33
Hi, I'm the product manager at CoinDesk. Thanks for the feedback. I'll discuss it with the team and we'll certainly consider it for the future.
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:25:34
That's what I'm really interested in seeing.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:36:49
I was thinking the same thing.

Marco Santori (a lawyer who consults for a lot of bitcoin companies) is writing a series on bitcoin law on CoinDesk:
@_date: 2013-10-03 07:10:01
Was a good meaty story as well.
@_date: 2013-09-25 17:47:41
We now have one up on that: 
@_date: 2013-09-27 10:55:32
Not necessarily true: 
@_date: 2013-09-24 15:17:41
Ah yes, good point. Now fixed!
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:46:54
Our writer actually genuinely made that typo in the original story... glad I spotted it before publishing ;)
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:59:36
@_date: 2013-09-10 07:55:43
Haha, yes. They're coming, don't worry! :)
@_date: 2013-10-11 07:18:57
You know Bigpoint accepts bitcoin btw: 
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:57:18
I know, right. Crazy what they've achieved with such a small team.
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:07:02
Congrats, guys! Great news. ZeroBlock has a really great, clean design. Big fan.
@_date: 2013-10-24 12:21:52
I've used BitBargain for most of my purchases. It was good (slightly cheaper than Bittylicious).
I'd like to try LocalBitcoins as well at some point.
Yeah, Bitstamp rate might be better, but it sucks that you have to pay £10 for your international transfer/deposit in and wait days for it. Too slow.
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:01:28
But it *is* super convenient, and convenience is often prioritised by the mainstream consumer (and later, once something reaches critical mass, privacy becomes a bigger concern).

Olaf sounds like a legend. I love his comment:
“I make and lose a thousand dollars on a regular basis due to the price fluctuations,” he said. “For me, it’s more fun than scary.”

We now have official verification from Bloomberg that its staff are indeed testing the ticker.
Vera Newhouse, spokesperson for Bloomberg, has now officially confirmed the news.
“I was able to confirm that Bloomberg is testing Bitcoin composite pricing, but this is only accessible to internal users and not to Bloomberg Professional service (i.e Bloomberg Terminal) subscribers,” she said. “As a leading global provider of financial news, data and information, Bloomberg often prototypes new functions and dashboards; some that are eventually rolled out, and some that aren’t. It’s premature to provide any details about Bloomberg’s plans for this prototype at this stage.”
