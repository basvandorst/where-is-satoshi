He's THE most well-versed Bitcoin educator that exists:

I don't think that's a fundamental issue though.  Bitcoin needs to focus on being uncensorable and immutable.  That's what gives it value.  Payment is just one application that can eventually be built more efficiently on top of Bitcoin in the form of either a second layer or an altcoin which we can exchange seemlessly within the wallet app.  These infrastructure takes time to mature, so for the time being, let people speculate and hodl all they want, while price is being discovered.

That's what people do: chase profits.  If you have 2 bags, one holding Bitcoin, one holding Altcoins.  If Bitcoin is mooning, aren't you tempted to sell some Altcoins to get some Bitcoin action?  The reverse is also true, but less obvious (because Altcoins don't moon all at once)

Let's hope we solve this issue (really a wallet UI issue) so eventually moms and dads can use Bitcoin with ease, without knowing a thing about addresses or private keys.  Just like most people who uses the Internet don't know what packet switching is.  At that point we know we finally reached mainstream. 
We are still far from it now :)

If it is made possible (presumably by a hard fork) that lost coins are "reverted", then it means the forked blockchain is no longer immutable, causing the forked coin to immediately lose value and support.  In short: very unlikely to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:01:00
Also, keep in mind that the 2 biggest reasons (IMO) that Bitcoin is at today's valuation and growing, are (1) people believe that the blockchain is immutable, and (2) supply is fixed.  Everything else is secondary.  If one of these 2 properties is showing even the possibility of change, Bitcoin's value will most certainly crash.

Well we do have the unit Satoshi which is 10^-8 of a bitcoin.  So when 1 BTC = $1 million, 1 Satoshi would be worth exactly 1 cent.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:34:26
People can always buy fractions of BTC, so even if it gets to 1 million a coin, an average person can still trade and potentially profit.

To be fair the roadster seems like a cool car, I just don't like Tesla as a company.  Then again I don't really like Lambo's either, too over the top (Okay I'll show myself out)

You may then ask, why can't someone change the software to issue more coins? Well, that's called a "fork", which makes the new coin incompatible with the original bitcoin. And if no one adopts the new coin, its value would drop.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:09:42
Nothing really. But again, the impact on the main bitcoin chain will be very small in that case, if we extrapolate the trend from previous forks.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:29:50
This is my understanding: Anyone can run a full node or setup a miner.  If said person decides to tweak the software such that it becomes incompatible with the original Bitcoin blockchain, then a hard fork is created.  In this sense, anyone can fork Bitcoin at any time.  It doesn't mean that people would necessarily care though. Adoption is key, and that's where consensus comes in.  If there is no consensus on an upcoming fork, then it's highly unlikely that the original blockchain will be replaced.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:04:21
Increasing blocksize: (1) won't work in the long term, block size needs to get exponentially larger as adoption picks up = never ending hard forks; and (2) has a centralizing effect on nodes, thus possibility of a successful attack becomes higher.
The current state of Bitcoin functions reasonably well as a store of value, let's focus on getting this nailed down without sacrificing the core features of Bitcoin.  The next step: wide adoption as medium of transaction, can wait :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:50:55
No interest in a Tesla, at all.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:28:25
Undiscovered catastrophic bug in the code that wipes out the network and price collapses as a result.  It's highly unlikely, but not entirely outside the realm of possibilities.

First of all, a bitcoin wallet doesn't store your actual coins.  Your coins are "located" in the blockchain.  The wallet stores your private key which allows you to access your coins in the blockchain.
Secondly, there are all kinds of different wallet options: web-based, phone app, hardware, paper... etc. When using those if you are asked to write down either a "private key" or a 12- or 24-word "pass phrase", please do write them down and store them in a safe place.  If you lose them, you lose your coins.  Other wallet services, like Coinbase, store the private key for you and hence they have control over your coins.  
If history is any indication, these centralized services will be hacked eventually.  Doesn't mean you can't use them, just don't leave large sums of coins on these wallets for a prolonged duration.  Hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger wallet so far is your best bet for safe long term storage.

People can fork all they want, if no one adopts it, it will just go to zero while bitcoin keeps badgering on.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:54:23
The software/protocol dictates the rules. All bitcoin participants need to run the same software. No one knows the identity of the original creator of this protocol.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:41:35
No.  People with highest marginal cost will quit mining, difficulty decreases, profitability goes up for the remaining miners.  The cycle has repeated several times already.

In the same sense, when people argue that Bitcoin is wasteful since it consumes a lot of energy per transaction, you can counter by saying that it's a feature, not a bug: it spends energy to be secure without the need of a 3rd party, and that's exactly the appeal.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:32:51
Not just record keeping, but tamper-proof record keeping.  If you centralize the data, it can easily be hacked by external actors or altered by the host itself.  The bitcoin blockchain uses energy to secure the data, such that in order to alter it the attacker would need to spend enormous amount of resource (hardware + energy).  In my view, the entire "faith" in bitcoin as a store of value is based on this security model.  
You can of course build other applications on top of this model, or protocol, then you can debate whether it's actually more or less efficient than traditional databases.  But for bitcoin to be a good store of value, the proof of work protocol is what works best as of now.

Technically you're right: if absolutely no one wants to trade, then the market is dead and no value can be assigned to it.  By definition, price is given if a trade happens, and if no one trades, there's no price.
In real life that won't happen.  Even if no one wants to sell their coin, if a buyer is willing to raise the offering price high enough (say 1 million dollars) for someone to sell, then price goes up.

It's backed by the electricity used by miners that secures the network, which as of this year is in the order of 20 teraWatt-hour.

Regarding banking the unbanked, Andreas Antonopoulos has an interesting talk that touched upon this subject: Deep in the Amazonian rain forest where villages are at least 100 miles away from the nearest bank branches, BY BOAT, they all have a small solar panel that powers a few Nokia feature phones with base station connections.  These are all they need to trade bitcoin, since text-based services exist to access bitcoin wallets.  These kinds of infrastructure are actually far more established than landlines.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:43:49
Bitcoin has value because it's immutable (unhackable).  If there is a remote possibility that the security can be compromised then Bitcoin probably won't be anywhere as valuable as it is today.  So I'd like to think that Bitcoin's value is backed by the security in the network, which in turn by definition is proportional to the electricity spent on the network.  
I'm also new to Bitcoin so please prove me wrong if you don't agree with the above observation. :)
