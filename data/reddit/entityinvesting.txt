What a blessing in disguise. Well I hope some of you were able to take advantage of such a dynamic lifestyle. I learned of BTC via the dollar vigilante just 2 years ago. Always wished I could have been on that up tick when I was a military guy, it could have really helped me change a lot of people's lives.

See these are the true stories behind BTC. I am so tired of regular everyday guys saying "man had I", or "I missed that boat". 
The real answer is "no dude!...YOU weren't even in the vicinity of that circle". 
Thank you for this type of info...it actually makes so much sense.

One of the best videos on Bitcoin this year! I like how this guy used this as an opportunity to educate and not just poll people. Good for us!!! Go BTC!
