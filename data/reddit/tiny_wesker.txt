perhaps just have a designated threshold of change/time. Also since I'm out of the loop are people just really dedicated to this meme or is it a bot thing? I feel like this is the kind of thing a bot could do really well.

If your vendor pulls that scumbag type of move he's not your vendor anymore. Find someone else who's reliable.

Congrats, Ive been lurking for a while too but I just recently put in the effort to figure out how to get started, and bought because I saw the dip and thought now was a good time as any... then today happened. 
Still hodling though! Might take advantage of the second drop to invest some more.

70 cents? I'll need all I can get if this jokester wins. But I'm still not voting for him. Think of it as a consolation prize; "Oh, well, the meteor didn't wipe us all out. Have .001 BTC instead."

Is there any word on what is actually happening? I assume he just backed out because *damn* there were a lot of comments before it got locked.
But you're a mod so you might have info I don't know about.

Nope. Lost that one a long time ago.

I'm expecting 0.0000, he deleted the thread.
I've got nothing to lose though, doesn't cost me anything.
