Nope. I've invested only a few days ago, when the price dropped to 460. Sold when it reached 535. Walked away a richer man hahaha.
Nervous because I'd like to see it succeed. At this point, I won't put any more money into it though.

Gambling is also something you shouldn't pour thousands of dollars into, like some people are doing.

Yes in the future I will invest more. It's currently recovering from the media push. Price has over extended itself. 
I see too many people in this community buying and holding in the hopes we'll see the 2000 dollar Bitcoin. This is just dumb investing.

What if I told you.... investments shouldn't be based off of meme's and should be based off of careful analysis.

I dunno what I think about the bitcoin community man. It seems like it's filled with a bunch of die hard fans, that no matter what the news or charts look like continue to pour their money into. Investing in bitcoin is a real gamble. Way too volatile and unpredictable to be a smart investment. At least for now.
With that said, yes I am nervous.
Media hype brought a lot of investors in, thats why there's such a large increase in price per bitcoin. The price was left far ahead of what it should be, which is why we're seeing the drop.
In no other market would I pour more money into an investment like this. ESPECIALLY long term with the way things have been going. People urge you to hold on because "it's happened before". Markets don't work like that.
