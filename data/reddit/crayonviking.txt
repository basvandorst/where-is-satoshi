Good points. I agree.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:57:28
oh man, you are trolling, aren't you?! Dammit, I was really hoping you would be this crazy. Now I don't believe you are real
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:44:21


Yeah, I think this is the right answer. Also, the silly short-term quick buck people got taken and now are probably scared of bitcoin. I think the circumstances for it going down this time around are way different than in years past.
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:19:06


100 percent this. I would love for some in this sub to explain themselves and how they feel about this statement. You are sooo right.
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:36:27
I appreciate the depth of your paranoia
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:36:11
This is a reasonable comment. Rare these days!
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:48:26


You are crazy. No way. I am so saving this comment! LMAO
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:59:26
Oh I get it. You are trolling, right?! Cuz there is no way it's coming back. LMAO

This is good for McDonalds

Still doesn't make what he did less illegal. And he knew that. He took the chance, he got caught. He's paying for the crime.
If someone came to you and said, "Brah, let's make a darkweb website, where we can sell drugs and guns, and get a portion of the profits!!" You probably wouldn't do it with him because you know there's a good chance of going to jail if caught.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:32:22
Def looks like a piece of paper taped over the phone!
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:25:18
But he DID set up a website to sell drugs. He DID know that his website was being used to sell illegal services. He DID collect a percentage of those sales of illegal services.
He knew what he was doing was against the law. Regardless of whether is should be against the law, he knew it WAS against the law.
He took a chance. Got caught. That's the risk he took. I'm not saying it's right what happened, but he knew what he was doing was wrong in the eyes of the law. And he made a lot of money from it. 
When you do something against the law, and you get caught, you never know the what the punishment will be. Sometimes the sentence is light, sometimes harsh.
There is room for discretion in sentencing guidelines, that's why you should really be careful before you set up a website that sells drugs and other illegal things. 
I mean, that's why you don't set up a website doing it. You know you can get in a lot of trouble. He knew there was lots of trouble. But he did it anyway.
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:31:14


Which would be awesome.
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:04:02
I think you do know that. And you are being contrary. 
If you are trying to say it can't be PROVEN that he's dread pirate Roberts or that you don't think they did a good job PROVING it, that's fine.
But he is. And you know he is. Stop. If you wanna harp on other parts of the legal battle, cool. But you are just silly if you keep saying "but but you don't KNOW that he is the guy!"
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:12:35


No one. That's why it won't work. But the idea has been started so there may be something like it used for the foundation other stuff.
But as is, nope. Just the nerdiest of the nerds, like redditors, use it.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:09:20
Exactly. I'm not sue why so many people in this sub seem to ignore all of that
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:14:28
Hey I'm all for Ross Ulbricht's ideas. But at the same time, he knew what he was doing was against the law.
That's the risk you take. And ya never know how the court system will deal with you. Again, part of the deal if you do sketchy shit.
Having said that, I think he's a super cool guy. But this was the risk he took. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:14:55


Ugh, I hope not.
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:21:23
Oh I did, and I read a book about the case. Super interesting.
But the dude started a website to sell drugs, and made it easy to sell drugs. That's a pretty big risk, and he knew it was a risk as he was doing it.
I mean, regardless on what you think about the laws about drugs, fake ID, identity theft, etc, I think you know that if you build a site that makes all of that easy to sell AND you get a percentage of the proceeds, you are gonna be breaking the law.
He KNEW what he was doing was probably skirting the law. And that was the risk he took.
I like him, and his ideals, but he knew the risk when he set it all up. There's morality, personal code of ethics, etc. But if you do something against the law, even if it shouldn't be against the law, then you are taking a chance.
He took that chance. And got caught. Thems the breaks.
@_date: 2019-01-03 15:31:37


He is, and you know he is. You are just trying to be contrary. He admitted he was.
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:39:17
I saved your comment. I really really really wanna see your reaction over the next several months! lol
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:43:37
Why did you keep it there rather than immediately transfer to your own wallet though?
None of this shit is regulated. You gotta protect yourself. Yeah, sucks what happened to you, but brah..why did you keep it with them rather than your own wallet?
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:42:14
I like Ulbricht and his ideas. If he wouldn't have offered to have someone killed, I think he'd have a much easier chance at clemency.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:52:17
Ross had the whole murder-for-hire thing tho.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:21:10
ahhh, good to know!
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:45:23
Yep, this sounds sketchy as fuck.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:43:46


Not in this sub. Which is why this is so funny to watch
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:36:43
Yet he still drives uber. Hmmm, he must do it for the conversation then?
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:40:00
Most logical post in this sub. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:22:07
good to know. There are others on here saying the charges were only recently dropped. So good to know
@_date: 2018-12-02 04:18:21
Wait, you don't know what bitcoin was created to be used for?!
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:44:59
lol. wow, I need to be a mentor!
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:37:05


Um, look around this thread, man. And I wasn't throwing a tantrum! lol
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:23:05
and did you sell at that price?!
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:44:55
Brah, no one, when dating, talks about money. lolol You don't realize that?
Are you new to dating?!
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:13:17
Amazing artwork!
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:04:46
Never get into money talks early in dating. Def not online dating
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:46:10
100 percent agree with you. I wish this sub was dedicated to that sentiment.
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:26:16
You guys are so weird. It's like you forgot what bitcoin was actually designed for. It was never designed for an investment/gambling too.
You all treat it like stocks/stockmarket. It's nto.
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:23:48
Um, brah, I think your Christmas is gonna have a little less cheer. It's in like 19 days, so..um...
Do you, in your heart of hearts, seriously think that Bitcoin is going to go to $10,000 or $15,000 within 19 days?
I think you know the answer, and that's why you posted. Sorry, brah.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:17:44
But you guys ruined it. It was never meant for this. And it won't help you retire. 
All of you guys are ruining what it was intended for, which makes the fees too expensive to use. And when people stop using it, then it's value goes down. 
Your greed is what is messing everything up. Go back to buying pennystocks bro
