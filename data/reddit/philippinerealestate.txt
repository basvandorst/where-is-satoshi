You're welcome. I'm sorry but I don't know anyone using ETH here &amp; I have not heard of Abra. If ETH's TX fee is $2, then that's super cheap vs the ₱450 ($9) TX cashout fee of BTC. Will take a look at this.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:18:48
Yup. Just checked, ₱837k. Congrats again. You just have to becareful with the tax man. They might put a tax on our bitcoin cashout in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:37:15
We have other accounts so this was okay :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:45:19
This btc account was bought when it was around $4k &amp; cashed out when it was around $16k. We bought high &amp; sold higher.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:42:52
That makes sense, but, just to share, my wife and I had a rule for BTC: we will only place money that we were willing to lose. We created several accounts for BTC, lowest placement was ₱20k. I totally agree, peso keeps on losing value vs USD. Its so difficult to keep lifesaving in regular Peso accounts when it's not growing in value &amp; the living expenses keeps on inflating.
For this particular ₱41k that we cashed out, we're moving it to FAMI's ETF (23.15% YTD return). It's just our way of moving money around to increase our savings. Cheers man!

Cool! Shoot me a pm and maybe I could treat with 1 Redhorse beer lol! My friend from Italy went here and used bitcoin to pay for his 3 months stay (coverted btc to php). Cost of living is very cheap so if you have USD, you'll be like a millionaire here.
Cheers and Thank you!

True. I've seen posts here that showed banks were closing accounts. Our Central Bank is already getting involved with  the BTC exchanges, so I can't say for sure how long this will last. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:02:21
Thank you! That's awesome! 
To cash out: I sent my Bitcoins to Coins.ph (the fee was mBTC 0.91).
From Coins.ph, I used the cash out option via Cebuana Lhuiller (payout fee was ₱450). Cebuana Lhuiller is a nationwide Pawnshop, so I believe there should be one in Bacolod. Coins.ph has other alternatives for cashing out that doesn't involve banks so it should be a breeze for them to covert BTC to PHP.

Salamat! We've made terrible financial decisions before, so we've wisen up :)  our main business is in real estate, so we're up there with you when it comes to real estate. We wish you more success in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:26:32
Yes, I used Coins.ph. That is true, they have an annual limit. I am now on Level 2 (verified phone, identity &amp; selfie) so my annual cash out limit is ₱400,000 &amp; monthly limit is ₱250,000.
My Level 3 application is still pending (address verification).  Once I get approved to Level 3, my monthly cash out limit would be ₱400,000. In case I would need more than that, I'd have to register with them my business.
For our ₱41k cash out via Cebuana Lhuiller, the fee was ₱450, so that's 1.09% cash out fee. Yeah, I think you'll save more if you cash out here instead of using your US Bank. We don't have tax on Bitcoin for now (so that's going for us)
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:14:37
Yeah, I didnt know when I downloaded it in 2015. Then rechecked and saw it was from that guy Roger Ver. (I included it in the article because that's what I used).

@_date: 2018-01-07 05:32:00
Absolutely. The Philippine stock market is doing pretty well so, we're okay for now
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:22:14
You're welcome. When I shared this on Facebook, many of the people there got interested. Happy to be able to contribute in the adoption of bitcoin in the Philippines.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:55:40
Yes. For people earning in USD, $400 might be a small sum, but here, it's a significant amount of money :) 
Thank you very much. Hope it work out great for you as well. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:04:43
In 2 years time, you might just make it in our national news as one of our first bitcoin (peso millionaires). Cheers man &amp; Mabuhay ang Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:01:39
Oh man, our government just passed a tax reform, inflation is expected to increase to 4% (from 3.3%). 
We're not planning to keep it in fiat for long. We're actually moving it to ETF today (with a 23% YTD return, I know it's miniscule vs BTC return, but it's just one way for us to enjoy the bounty from BTC). We have other BTC accounts, so we're still happy. Cheers man.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:09:44
Thank you! (Salamat!) I know the BTC price will still go up. We have other accounts that's been set up. This particular account was for my wife. The purpose was for her to experience bitcoin. She's now very happy so that's the best outcome for me (happy wife, happy life :) ).
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:12:08
Thank you very much my good sir :)
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:48:16
Yes, around that figure
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:03:48
Yes. That's true. $800 is huge for a regular employee. 
That's 2 months worth of salary. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:11:34
Just want to add. We're a believer that Bitcoin (&amp; Blockchain) will have a big impact in Philippine Real Estate. Wrote some articles about it [here](
Also, I try to share/preach bitcoin to my fellow Filipinos whenever I have talks/speeches. [Proof](
Finally, we're hoping to integrate bitcoin payment in our software as our Filipino contribution to the Bitcoin community. 
Salamat! 
Dios Mabalos!
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:52:50
Yeah, it's 1 month worth of income for an office employee. 
If an employee is earning ₱20k per month, he would need to save for 2-3 months to invest that sum (₱10k or half of the monthly pay would be used for his daily expenses)
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:02:43
Thank you. We have other accounts that we HODL :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:29:08
Congrats man! I think my wife bought when it was ₱200k ($4k) per piece. Hope you share with us your experience once you cashout. Cheers!

Hey, thanks for letting us know there's a sub specifically for that. I subscribed.
Looking forward to reading that you sold your property via Bitcoin in the future.
"Human Rights" isn't much of an issue here, really. The political opposition is just really really enthusiastic in toppling down the present administration that they're using the Human Rights commission &amp; influencing the UN Human Rights council to spread this Human Rights issue.
Been living here for the past 29 years, believe me when I say the human rights problem that you hear on the news is exaggerated.
I do really hate the politics here in the Philippines, so, that's as much political discussion as I go.
I'm really hoping more Filipinos would get to know bitcoin &amp; the other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:47:30
That would be ₱417,471,867,586.3895. Can I offer you 1/3 of the Philippines? Natives are friendly and there's some rebels in the mountains, but other than that, it'll bring good bang for your Bitcoin. 
Edit: I'll offer the you the whole Philippines. Take it or leave it.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:53:02
Yeah. Absolutely. And some ladboys too haha
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:16:49
Not really. Lol maybe 1 or 2 regions our of 17. 
(That's 2.58% of the Philippines GDP. Enough to bribe every politician, police &amp; military).
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:49:05
That's $3.8Trillion (BTC 470,443,779.9729). That's more than enough. You can probably even take the Philippines' Spratlys Islands that the Chinese invaded &amp; Saba that the Malaysians took.
