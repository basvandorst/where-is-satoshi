Both. To everything there is a season...turn, turn turn. Fiat is working fine 'for now', but as Voltaire said the true value of fiat is always zero. Jesse Livermore famously said: 'there isn't a bull side or a bear side, but a right side and a wrong one.' If you're making money you got it right, if your losing money you got it wrong.

Going sideways isn't going sideways, but base building. I'm proud to announce 3/1/2019 the price of BTC exceeded the first of my four technical step. Since 2/2018 BTC has been the kiss of death, but things they are a-changing. One fourth of my money allocated to BTC sez so.

One can 'cherry pick' data to prove anything. As Twain once said: 'There are lies, damn lies, and statistics'. Running the data over the past year gives slightly different results -- LOL.

If you were measuring the tulip price index in March of 1637 your results would have looked the same. Prices were way off the highs, but still way higher than in early 1636. Over time a 1% stake in tulips and 99% in cash would have been a colossal loser.

The rise of a 100% gold backed crypto ending the payment advantage BTC currently has.
@_date: 2019-02-04 17:55:06
That would do it, but then there the problem of holding fiat/BTC on an exchange. BTC seems destined for cold storage non-circulation, just like gold.

The Billion Prices Index (red time inflation taken from a broad spectrum of retail establishments in a specific country) is a dead ringer for the CPI. This means the US government is dead honest in reporting CPI numbers. This unfortunately is not the case in all countries, notably Argentina, where the government has purposely understated the inflation rate by 50% vs. the Billion Prices Index. The market knows whats going on and has slammed the Arg Peso because of the cheating. Fortunately there are many more USA's in the world than Argentinas. This isn't to say the USA and other countries won't one day 'massage' the inflation numbers...but they haven't yet.

It's not an either/or...rather BOTH are stores of value. BTC is digital gold great for payment transfer, while gold is physical gold great for making a ring, or playing king Midas and dropping them through your fingers. Both have limited supply vs. helicopter fiat money printing. What I do is price compare BTC/gold with technical analysis and invest accordingly. Hint as of today gold wins out, but that says nothing about the future.

And rational.  The technical price at 15k justified buying while the current 3K price justifies selling.  All markets are speculative, some more than others. Every asset however, has a buy and sell price which is determined by the actions of others. As mentioned in an earlier post (above) buying/selling should be done without emotion. Don't love your asset, it certainly doesn't love you!

Problem is BTC underperformed all the top shitcoins in Fridays fat finger move. What would have impressed me would have been BTC up 10% and the alts down by 10%. Until 95% of the shitcoins are kaput and the only coins left are BTC and stables the downward pressure will continue, IMO.

Guy has it wrong. If you never sell BTC to buy anything with it's not a currency but solely a store of value...like diamonds. Interesting that only two people in Ohio have opted to pay their taxes in BTC, obviously paying in fiat instead. As I've said before this is Gresham's Law in action driving the 'good money BTC' out of circulation. The way I see it BTC can either be a 'good currency' store of value and remain out of circulation, OR a 'bad currency' turning worthless circulating currency that everyone wants to get rid of. Chances are the two Ohio tax payers were not members of the HODL club selling their BTC 'bad currency' thinking the price would continue to fall.
@_date: 2019-02-04 10:29:14
Gresham's Law... bad money will drive good money out of circulation, is at work explaining why BTC is held and not used for transactions. Say you have two coins in your wallet at bit and a shit; which one would you spend -- lol. This is both a strength of bitcoin and a huge weakness as well,  exact same as holding on to an Eisenhower pure silver dollar while spending a shit Susan B.

Then, again, one BTC might not buy you a bit of pizza. My analysis has us at peak 'fiat', that doesn't mean however that the price of BTC is destined to move higher, given the BTC price bubble blow up in 2017. I'm thinking there's a bunch of froth left in the price. Buying BTC should be thought of as only a very long commitment...spanning a lifetime. Want to know what the world's oldest forms of money were, well they were ag commodities which have been in a relentless downward slide since early 2011. As they slid, fiat rose. Today I'm getting the first signs that the trend MIGHT be reversing. Go wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, etc.

The problem the SEC has with BTC is the 'S' or Security designation. Crypto like gold isn't a security (as BTC is presently defined), but an asset...like gold. So the ruling needs to be changed and might be if a Republican bill can pass through Congress...someday. Until then the SEC will most certainly sit on its hands, meaning NO BTC ETF in the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:48:58
Once BTC volatility calms down (last month is encouraging...lowest monthly volatility ever I believe) and the price movement is the same as gold (not encouraging), then and only then will BTC' be a 'store of value'. Until then it's a pure speculation play with only rogue central banks adding it to the balance sheet such as Russia or Iran avoiding sanctions.

Only thing I can see messing this up are alt coins that are linked to gold. The same inflation arguments that apply to BTC also apply to gold, and with gold 50% the price of BTC, but not having digital buying power the jury is still out

This is exactly why BTC'ers need an ETF making inheritance of BTC as simple as AAPL.

I caution against delusion.  Since when did .033% of the world's population ever lead anything? Especially when the .033% is not made up of the super-elite, but recent college grads struggling to pay off their student loans.

For BTC to each 1 mil the dollar would have to crash by an equal amount. Only one thing sends a currency into a tailspin of such magnitude and thats rampant inflation. Problem is today inflation isn't inflation...but deflation. I use the SLV:GLD (silver/gold) ratio which has been pointing down (deflation) for a goodly number of years, and with no turnaround in sight. Until silver outperforms gold the gains in BTC will be limited.

Understand  that costs to the merchants are always in fiat, so to accept BTC they instantly become a HODL'er. Fine if the price of BTC is going up, but if down the margin they operate on is quickly eliminated. Merchants by in large are not gamblers.

Jesse Livermore (greatest trader who ever lived) said...don't expect the market to blow a horn at the top or ring a bell at the bottom, or tell you why its doing what it does. Successful traders act on subtle, but significant, changes before others identify with a sell stop determined that will let profits run or cut losses. His most famous line was: 'Be right and sit tight.' Neither are easy to do which is why dollar cost averaging HODLing is recommended for 99% of the population.

Whatever the price the only rational thing to do is accept it. I've come to the conclusion (after extensive painful trial and error) that arguing with the market is like arguing with the wife...you never, ever win.

Jim Rodgers makes an interesting point...in an apocalyptic future whats the value of BTC if there's no electricity, ergo no computers. Be careful what you wish for.

Can't be good. Every time a terrorist group or extorters demand payment in BTC is makes it more of an outlaw money form in the eyes of the general population slowing adoption and inviting more government regulation. Has anyone heard of any kidnappings that were paid in BTC? Watching shows about kidnapping the criminals were almost always caught at the money drop off location, BTC would solve that problem.

After New Year pop, BTC down for the year...as of moment.

Great posts. But from what I can figure out it's impossible to value BTC, or anything else for that matter. I've decided the best way to deal with the uncertainty is dollar cost averaging which I've done every two weeks since I landed my first real job. Each payday I drop in 10%, happy today that I can buy 2x as much as when I started. I missed out on the last two run ups, I'm NOT missing out on the next when. Its not enough to just HODL the dedicated have to start buying again taking BTC from weak hands so the price can start moving back up. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:47:12
...that just in today's pricing. I'm looking for BTC to be 2x that a year from now.
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:56:52
If you think it's going to the grave you sell, the moon you buy. HODLing is not an option, either fish or cut bait.
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:02:30
Great posts, but...the value can never be determined, so I'm dollar cost averaging. Started with my first paycheck on 8/31 with my first BTC buy. Missed out on the 2017 run being poor and in school, I'm NOT going to miss out on the next one when ever it happens. Now with a job I drop in 10% every two weeks, (I'll buy some more tomorrow) happy I can buy 2x the BTC than when I started out. It's not enough to just HODL we have to ADD buying coin taking it from the weak hands and pumping up the volume. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:12:14
Dollar cost averaging is the way to go. I drop in 10% of my paycheck and love it when the price is lower so I can buy more. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:03:21
At these levels HOLDers aren't doing us any favors. Either be an ADD'er or fucking sell.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:41:35
Bottom is in...back up the trunk and load up on BTC. Now is the time we need buyers not HODLers.
