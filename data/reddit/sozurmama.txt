This lady wants to show you how to make BTC out of the goodness of her heart and you call her a scammer.

I just paid a 50 cent fee and got a confirmation in like 10 or 15 minutes.

I will abuse my servants.

Translation: i failed at trading so it doesn't work XD
@_date: 2019-11-08 13:02:42
Stocks are much more difficult to trade imo. There will always be someone on the sell side, although I position trade on margin so i don't need to buy after a big move, im already in and taking profit

Finally i can buy a beer without Bitcoin Cash!

Half of the hash rate is on bcash right now, so block times are much slower than normal. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:59:31
They are about 50% slower right now, I wouldn't call that slightly. Mempool has doubled as the block time has increased. I completely agree though that utilizing the new scaling improvement will help. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 00:48:07
Just like trading anything else, you might make or lose money.

If you have ever been in the military or have family that was or is in the military, USAA is supportive of bitcoin, and they have awesome auto insurance. You can even link your coinbase wallet to view your balance on USAA.com, not that I would keep anything on coinbase.

Nah my savings is in cash so it has low risk of severe depreciation and is immediately accessible for emergencies.
@_date: 2016-12-24 02:35:14
It seemed like the best strategy for me because of the crazy volatility... I thought buy low sell high was a good thing. I am totally open to constructive criticism if you have time to explain why this a bad idea!
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:35:13
Bitcoin is an allocated percentage of my investment portfolio, I trade when that percentage gets out of whack and it has been working well for me.

THIS JUST IN: BITCOIN SALESMAN RECOMMENDS YOU PURCHASE BITCOIN!
@_date: 2019-06-07 11:24:04
YOU CAN'T SMOKE A BITCOIN
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:10:38
No, if you can make money trading then you can build up to where you want to be without the debt.

Someone's gonna miss out on alt season

TIL hashpower follows price. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:27:00
They are there, thanks! It shows that they are banned until tomorrow, is that appropriate? I'm fairly ignorant, just trying to help the network.
@_date: 2019-02-26 11:43:48
That's right guys, altcoins will only bring pain and definitely aren't a way to stack more $BTC
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:49:48
lol, yeah that seems adequate. Thanks again!
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:31:57
Actually the entire supply has remained in wallets since the beginning.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:15:59
i pasted the contents of the text file and the return was "null".
@_date: 2017-04-20 00:59:18
Well, if you thought segwit was dangerous, and cared about litecoin, you wouldn't want it activated there either. I support segwit, i'm just sayin.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:20:48
It's mainly that there are so many more attack vectors on your phone, and the fact that your phone is on and connected to the internet most of the time. Hardware wallets are designed to store private keys and sign transactions, and only power on when your plug them into a power source. That is basically all they can do, therefore someone cant infect it with malware to record your pin input, or possibly bypass the pin somehow, or hack the files to find the keys stored on the phone, etc. With a hardware wallet, you have to physically have the wallet and know the password, or get the recovery seed of course.
@_date: 2017-04-15 14:41:27
Oh shit my debit card is a Visa! 
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:42:19
Also is a great way to get rich
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:44:07
Trezor, Ledger, and other hardware wallets are much more secure than your phone. It's like having your money in a high quality safe vs a shoe box with string tied around it. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:58:48
Thx bro don't worry ill sell them back to you later ��

They are premining from the snapshot block.
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:56:36
So did pokecoin. Gotta hash 'em all! 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:47:16
I like gemini because they allow instant trading with bank transfers. Gdax fees at coinbase speed. Of course they have a 500 dollar daily deposit limit though, unless you wire. Get a hardware wallet, even if it's just a cheap ledger hw1. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:28:00
What if incredibly wealthy entities that bitcoin poses a danger to subsidize the process? We are not talking about much money in the grand scheme of things. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:36:02
I was thinking more along the lines of subsidizing miner income, not matching the market cap. The bias would be obvious to the economic majority, but in my mind the goal would be simply to acquire the brand and confuse the situation for the less aware.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:53:22
What if the majority of miners decide to mine at a loss until their coin is called "bitcoin" on major exchanges?

So Bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:31:04
So you believe the probablility that businesses will collude and invest for a short period of time in order to hijack a popular brand name is ~1/2^96?
@_date: 2016-10-21 11:05:28
I agree with the other posters, you shouldn't keep short term savings in crypto. I am a huge long term bull, but you need to be prepared for a lot of volatility on the way there. I'm keeping 20% of long term investments in a crypto portfolio, but my emergency savings are in USD.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:43:52
I don't know, I have never tried to due to the fees associated with it.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:03:49
I'm pretty sure I've only given my name and email on 5 or so exchanges I've used so far.
@_date: 2016-10-08 19:06:44
Bitcoin atm? 
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:25:46
Some of us want to keep our long term holdings safe in case of a segwit bug.
@_date: 2019-05-20 23:06:18
Demand was greater than supply
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:13:59
Nothing known, i think segwit is cool technology but it is more complex and newer, therefore  more likely to have issues arise with addresses vs legacy. Not trying to fear monger, just being realistic.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:12:53
Ugh, these assholes making agreements with each other to gain consensus, I fucking hate politics. They should just force change without consensus like real men! BIP148!!!!

It's hard to be over rated as one of the best point guards in the league ranking first, second and fifth in all time single season three point totals, third all time three point percentage, and third all time free throw percentage.

Fees aren't "insane". Fees are increasing because we are gaining users. You want to make hasty changes because you speculate it will be abandoned if we don't? It sounds like you are frustrated that you aren't making as much money as you think you could be.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:53:26
I am very curious as well, as an American who is only taxed once on my crypto gains.
