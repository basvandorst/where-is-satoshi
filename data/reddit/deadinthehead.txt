Use to browse the site for years, kinda surreal seeing them add btc.

I only watch segments of his show (I'm not American either) and he comes across.... kindafine. What's so bad may I ask, because I notice more and more hate for him on reddit.

I really admire this organisation. Standing up to prohibition in the face of massive public hysteria can't be an easy job. It is a shame that some idiots will make the link with anti drug prohibition and bitcoin, with the silkroad (a bunch of punks just wanna get high!) without actually considering there rational at all. Anyway, go LEAP!

Some shop keepers about to get in trouble..

Cex? dame I've bought from them a few times. Ok, i'll say it, this changes *everything.*

They should just inherit wealth like I did.

True, cheques and magnetic strip cards are still in use in the US. BTC wise though no bank will touch you if you talk about it in the UK.

I wish I just waited a few more hours, I bought @ around $630 or so before the China news.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still very bullish, even now theres an uptrend in China, I just hate that I missed out on really cheap coins.

I don't understand Bobby here. If 3rd party processors are banned from dealing with BTC, then how can BTCChina find a new processing partner? All I can think is using a foreign company but that'll probably be worse, politically.

You should feel bad.

Definitely holding too, and I will be buying again soon as well. I just hate getting burnt like this.

As a small retailer, I fully agree. My bank charges £0.50p per transaction plus a monthly rental fee of £30 to accept card payments.
