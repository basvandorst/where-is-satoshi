I"m trying to make a bitcoin video for my channel (Art of the Problem) for lay people. And I'm stuck on the opening 30 seconds..
My most recent iteration was:
* Remind people that physical money is a form of freedom
* You don't have that freedom online (censored money)
* Digital cash is an inevitability (Milton freedman quote here), not a matter of IF but WHEN....
I like that....but can you suggest something better, what's your current pitch?
Thank you kindly.

thank you for the feedback, much appreciated

50 day moving average price is above 200 day moving average price
(i.e. the price is higher and it was in the past 100 days or so)

Thanks so much for the vote of confidence...I need it right now...
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:15:44
love the quotes
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:02:03
right, money begins of a thing of value (treasure...valuable because others want it) and later becomes a unit of exchange once the demand for the 'thing' has been fully expressed.
I'd say right now, the markets haven't existed to "measure the global demand for bitcoin", they are just emerging now to touch everyday people and that's when the value of Bitcoin hits a "logical limit"....and then at that point it will work more like digital gold money.
it will hold some large price, and people will send chunks of it around without worry of 40% swings anymore.
(it doesn't need to work for micro settlements, it can be a layer 1 currency - if it does, all the better for it)
i think Bitcoin price needs to grow 10x to get a 10x reduction in volatility which is what we need basically for it to stabilize and become a kind of money instead of an 'investment in future money'

I used this and many other great satoshi quotes in this video THE TRUST MACHINE: 
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:31:16
Based on popular demand it's possible...I just don't think it could be much more than a trailer at that point.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:28:34
awesome awesome points......going to mull this over for a bit, I may respond with some more questions. also can I share a draft script with you when I get one?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:23:54
well let's think about that more. Let's say I have two things 
A. a promise that Cindy will give me 1 day of her labour
B. a promise that Mark will give me 1 day of his labour
let's say at first those have values A &amp; B. Maybe they are worth about the same (let's say 5 oz of silver)
But then words get's out that Mark is a thief, not only does he do bad work but he steals......and word also gets out that Cindy can do "as much work as 10 men"...
suddenly the value of A is skyrocketing and B is plummeting...in fact maybe A is worth 10x of B.
You see "money" (Dawkins calls it: the promise of delayed reciprocation) is entirely linked to trust....and if trust breaks down, so does the price.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:23:02
Great post, I have a YouTube channel Art of the Problem and I've been slaving away on a Bitcoin Video script to illuminate people for months now...I realized that 95% of the understanding is knowing how money emerges, and 5% of it is the protocol.
A few other thoughts 
1. The first "money" was simply a promise of future value (IOU)
2. Human memory is weak so once we started writing we wrote down a list of who owes who what, i.e. a leder (first cuneiform documents are ledgers!)
3. The reason why money also began taking physical form (via treasures or collectibles such as shells) is because it works well when you *cross trust boundaries* (IOU's don't hold water when you go visit another tribe...they are no longer "transferable" - also treasures work well when you cross long periods in time (passing treasures for inheritance)
So money is "transferable credit" and within a family of trusted people we don't need physical tokens for it (a ledger works fine) -  physical money is a way to make it trustless when you trade across cultures/tribes.
way later in history we ended up back with 'digital money' (i.e. 95% of money is just a ledger) which is protected/controlled/monitored by 3rd party. 
And so the missing problem we always had is "how can we we send value along a communication channel without a trusted third party"...that's what the Bitcoin paper addresses.
One other thing I wanted to throw out there when it comes to the protocol.
When explaining to a layperson, I would say that bitcoin takes the great feature (of flaw for some people) of the internet (information can't be stopped) and turns it into a security advantage - if we tell everyone to copy a file, then it's impossible to "stop"....but the KEY is how can we know which copy of the file is the real copy? The answer is simple - we ask everyone in the network to VOTE on which is the real copy, and the majority vote is the copy we attribute truth to.
that democratic aspect I think people can understand.
of course there are many other details, but I just wanted to dump some ideas
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:35:01
Please share that's my goal for this video
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:28:40
yes I agree with this. First we value it, then we use it in exchange. 
So we can transform an IOU in virtual form into physical form, using an object that is *already* desired (when crossing trust boundaries). 
the one issue I know people have with bitcoin is the "when did the value start"....and that's harder to make clear for people I've found. Because Bitcoin started as more or less an experiment in digital tokens...they had no "value", and the value was attributed purely for fun at first.....and interestingly, it's only when they had this "fun value" (few pennies) that they were used in a real marketplace (silk road) which then drove the value up to several dollars due to basic supply and demand (money's value is linked to the demand in good settled in that currency), from there it begins working as a store of value...etc.
but that step seems to confuse people the most - thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:26:13
Can you share your thoughts on this? I'll be sure to review this(
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:53:51
I like both these comments so let me try and clarify....
Yes I agree the dollar isn't backed by a 'thing', and it also exists in digital form. So you could say a dollar is just "a piece of information" (and it can "jump" into paper form...but only ~5% of the circulated money is in paper form)
and yes it's true that


more like, "money is a message which contains a unit of measure"
the advancement is how that 'information' moves around: free or not?
digital fiat is CENSORED MONEY (fully controlled and watched by 3rd party at all times) and it's flow is highly restricted.
cryptocurrency is UNCENSORED MONEY (nobody controls it, or needs to know who is on each side of the transaction) like cash but in virtual form.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:56:37
yes but the concept up exchanging 'value' for 'a promise of value', is something we all do naturally so there is no cognitive load to understand it.
@_date: 2018-09-07 00:47:02
Sweet glad the hard work payed off, I read everything on this subject to a point where I can't read anything anymore or even keep up on new developments.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:27:27
Great to hear! I think maybe the best application of this video is filling in gaps for people who have already gotten their feet wet. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:51:54
YES - it's interesting that the public keys *must* exist in space. And we know information has a compression limit based on laws of physics - basically x bits requires y volume in space to hold the states needed for that information.
So Bitcoin is "information stored in space(s)"
it's neat because it's both a single abstract thing (the ledger) and physical (the individual instances of the ledger)
and the thing doesn't depend on any one physical link.

Sweet thanks so much for this feedback - gives me the motivation to keep going....
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:29:23
Perfect that was my hope for this video...save yourself some time. I also find that people who watch this will either come out with good questions or they will simply not watch it or stop early as they don't want to get their head around it due to some kind of bias.
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:04:16
Great feedback - lots of people seem to be bothered by the music at that part. Unfortunately you can't redub YT videos so I'd have to do a fresh upload. I might consider addressing both points of feedback by making a 3-5min version with no music at some point.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:40:13
Wow, thanks for all the love and insightful critique/comments. I agree with pretty much everything that has been said here. Also, it seems many people want me to make a 3-5min version but I can't imagine it would be more than a glorified trailer - any thoughts?
Also the YT algo has destroyed my channel growth in recent years, so if you could share subscribe that would help me out ( I'm currently pondering a multi-video series on AI (or a follow up to this video). Would love your thoughts on that as well.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:26:49
Yeah I struggled with this balance. Ultimately I decided my audience for this would be people who "want" to understand Bitcoin and wouldn't want all the handwaving you get in the 3-5min explainers.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:28:06

Thanks for this, I will indeed keep making content which tries to teach/inform/inspire. This video was by far the hardest to get right, especially in this space which is so so heated. So far it's held water so I'm proud of that. Hope you find some of the other videos of interest. Appreciate your thoughts
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:33:35
Big time...the past 3 years my viewership went sideways. The first 3 years was a nice upward slope. Now that I only produce 2-3 videos a year YouTube seems to not even share my videos with my subscribers My hope for this video would be word of mouth sharing...

Last friday I was explaining Bitcoin to a friend of mine who is a mom and finance manager. She was curious but totally sceptical due to media informed knowledge-base. This is maybe the 5000'th time I've had this conversation in the past 6 years. I'm happy to see that it CAN be a short conversation now. (used to be 60min and now it can be 15min) 
This time I pivoted straight to gold from the get go, an answered the first set of questions that way- "forget bitcoin for a second, are you sure you know how gold works?" (that answers the inevitable, how can a virtual thing have value?), once she agreed with that - I was one step away from the "how is it safer?" step which I explain using Bitcoin finally. This time I shortened the explanation to "it's like a democracy, where every computer is an independent vote" - and "it's just a shared file of accounts". NO MATH NEEDED (instead I said "we don't talk about the math behind your bank login, so why both with this just know it's 'never been broken' and '200 billion are up for grabs if you can break it' - and she was satisfied)
then we ENDED the conversation with the question of how it starts, how they distribute ("random sprinkle every 10 min which winds down over 100 years")...and "the supply number doesn't really matter, it's arbitrary like other money" 
for the first time after around 20min I said "but I'm sure you have many questions"....and she responded "not really" and wanted to share the explanation with everyone at work.
My lesson was
- let their questions drive the explanation (which more or less follows the chunks in this video)
- lead with gold and don't bother with ramble about "what it is" because people have already heard it in one way or another, and now they are ready with a set of questions (probably 3-5 questions on average)
- skip math completely unless it's someone who already gets it and is truly interested in "file structures" (~2% of population?) and mathematical security.
Can't wait for halvening

Much appreciated I spent a long time on that intro. I know, I did my very best with the mining and decided that instead of glossing it over I'll just simplify as far as possible so that people could come back to it later. some have suggested to make a 6min version of this video but I never got around to it

Thank you TerribleD. People have suggested I re-edit a shorter version of this video and I'm still thinking about it...not in love with the idea but maybe a 6min video might be nice. what are your thoughts?
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:02:57
@_date: 2012-09-16 17:13:38
Very true. The only problem is they A. stripped it out of context and B. there is no attribution (multiple people had stolen that video, the old draft, posted it on YouTube and had ads running). I'm happy to give away my stuff on Khan Academy and YouTube for free...but if someone is going to steal it, and re-upload I'd at least hope they give credit. I agree though, the take down on wimp wasn't really needed but I just submitted all of them at once. I've never done that before and I felt weird about it when it actually happened (I had no clue YouTube was that efficient at take downs)
@_date: 2012-09-27 15:43:45
Good point. I have the other version on my youtube channel so you can still view it &amp; share it. It's really hard to make a series that is semi-self contained
