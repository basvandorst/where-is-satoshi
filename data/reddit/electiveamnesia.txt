From Google, "Honey can contain spores of a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum, which can germinate in a baby's immature digestive system and cause infant botulism, a rare but potentially fatal illness."

So you're telling me if the price were to drop to $10 tomorrow and those 547 bitcoins were now $5470, it's not a loss? It's like if you sold a house for 6 million in gold and tomorrow they find the world biggest gold deposit so now gold is worthless. It's a loss because you can no longer sell it for 6 million so it's worthless even if you still have that same amount of gold.

That doesn't make it a scam. They can't just run off whenever they want, it would still exist with or without the team. It still has value to it, whereas Bitconnect has no real value without the platform. No one would want it because it would be impossible to liquidate.

It's a loss if you liquidate it.

He has a point. You should have done your own research but instead of that you made your trading decisions based on what other people are saying and emotions. Stop that. It was your own fault and no one is to blame.

You're right. Taxaction IS theft. The government stealing from us. We're dealing with an unregulated market with no protection for the investor, why should they tax us?

Dips will shake out the normies. That's probably what is happening right now.

It's easier if you do invest money you can lose. I started 8 months ago and I've become jaded to dips that I simply just don't look at prices anymore. Instead I just look at new things to invest in. Cryptocurrency doesn't even have half the marketcap of Apple, there's no way that the entirety of crypto can be valued that low. Holding is so much easier if you have a strong belief that we will go higher.

The best plan for hodling is often doing nothing. Just buy and forget about it.

Normies are a double edged sword. They FOMO like hell but they also panic sell. Oh well. Makes everything more exciting.
