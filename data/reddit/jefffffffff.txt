Unpopular opinion: Those people that scratched their private words with the nano s deserved to lose their funds. Buying off ebay first off... then not taking 2 minutes to watch a quick review on youtube of how to set it up. Some people take short cuts without doing their proper research and taking the time needed to fully understand where you put your money.

Combining the best 2 decisions you have literally ever made in your life. Invest in crypto and quitting darts. Good choice op. Stick to it

He literally made me 20x on my money. When he went on the joe Rogan experience the first time he blew me away. So articulate and passionate, but also patient with newbies like joe. This was my first hearing about bitcoin and I did some research. After that podcast I purchased some bitcoin and as a result this money has changed my entire life. More importantly Andreas gave me a passion for something when I was lost in life. He's named the 'Bitcoin Jesus' for a reason

1. Show evidence for the russia collusion. He exposed government corruption during the war in the middle east. Hes a hero for showing us the TRUTH.

BTC AKA Bitcoin core is the true Bitcoin. A couple months ago Bitcoin forked off and created a brand-new coin called BCC AKA Bitcoin cash. It's value is close to 350$ now and spiked around 1000usd I think. This new fork will create a 3rd Bitcoin coin and because BCC is practically obsolete these two new ones will compete for top spot with the majority(devs, nodes etc) favouring btc

This made me chuckle. I fucking love how I've been so right on this. All my friends/coworkers that I told about btc in 2013 and 2014 continue to kick themselves while here I am rolling in lambos.

Yah you're right. Ohh wait 200 up from 2600 is like 8%.... That's notable I'd say
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:03:02
Should do. But remember when people were hoping it would drop down from 1400 to 800-900 after the announcement last month. Hehe ;) to the moon!!!
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:10:45
Realistically though should I sell 10-20% of my coins now any transfer to ethereum?
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:01:56
By the end of the week at this rate. ;) Honestly this recent push within the last couple months has got me so wet. What about when literally everyone has BTC? What will the price be then? 100k for one coin. Nobody knows.  I know like 200 people and only 2-3 of them even know what BtC is, let alone has any. Sitting on 7.05 BTC right now feeling pretty.

It's never too late. The downside now is you will have to wait longer and invest more to make it worth it. I bought all my coins around 300-400. Some people bought all theirs at 3-4 cents. Those people are now millionairs.

He'll yah. Was really hoping for this. The only exchange I have my btc on it. The rest under my private keys on my ledger wallet. Waiting patiently for my nano s
