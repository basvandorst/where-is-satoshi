Or they each buy one today and it doesn't affect anything
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:45:26
But they had the chance... and have the chance right now. I mean, they have the money.... I don't understand this.

Lol this is nuts
@_date: 2019-08-25 03:27:43
AFAIK there's no never a reported bug on a hardware wallet that guys just talking
@_date: 2019-08-25 03:24:31
To have thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin and not buy the 50 dollar hardware wallet is the lesson here. Sorry for your loss though.

Name doesn't check out. How could you even entertain the initial message my god the greed of people!
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:32:39
Gosh you went to a site called [bitcointoyou.com](  ? that alone should have been enough it's 2019.
That money is gone. On the bright side, happy cake day!
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:45:43
Well... I... Well.. I think you should buy now anyway and let's leave it at that!
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:31:33

@_date: 2019-06-26 20:53:07

@_date: 2019-06-26 06:30:32
You knew about bitcoin and believed in it so much you begged people to buy at $20 AND you knew about mining and didn't do either of those things? You should feel sick.
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:55:51
Oh... I thought it would be legendary wrestler Barry Horowitz!
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:29:49
It's a meme. Go back into your hole.

@_date: 2019-06-26 04:04:24
I struggle to understand the point of this nonsense?
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:37:13
You've taken your first steps into a much larger world
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:00:02
I really don't see the point of this
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:31:13
Sounds like something China would do
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:24:18

Learn to manage your own wallet. Do not leave your bitcoin on exchanges especially with limited computer knowledge. Buy a hardware wallet and read the manual. Figure it out. Challenge yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:44:09
That's a shitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:34:04
You sound like a guy who is going to take a pounding trying to trade. I'll keep my profits in the only thing that matters. Btc.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:34:35
I've only ever used localbitcoins and its great
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:23:35
This.... Is such a stupid picture my god. Microsoft with bitcoin? Appears to have been added? This is dumb all around please remove.
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:21:17
Yeah they just secretly arrest you and harvest your organs.
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:35:49
A beeter strategy is to hold. Its not coming back to 7500. You threw 2/5 of your coins that would have profited in the trash. Buy back in at 10k ? Or forget it? That's your choice now.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:13:59
oh I dont think so
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:10:58
