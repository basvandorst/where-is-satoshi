If Bitpay hasn't responded to you, I'd be very worried tbh.

Here's a story that may make you feel better:
  
  There once was a huge castle in a far away land that was home to a Prince. This particular prince met a powerful wizard named Natoshi Sakamoto. Worrying about how to guard his treasure, the prince asked Sakamoto to cast a spell on the castle's dungeon to seal his riches away behind a door that only a magical key can open. The castle guards, knowing that the prince was a very forgetful boy, offered to make a copy of the key, and to give the copy to the royal treasurer. Fearing that the treasurer might seek out the riches for his own, the prince insisted that he alone hold the key to the treasure.
 
 After hearing the story of the prince and his magical door, the townspeople convinced the royal court to store their valuables away in dungeon as well. This worked well for them, as their valuables were protected from thieves, and had the oversight of the prince who was solely wielding the sorcerer's magic.
One day, the wizard disappeared, and on that same day, the prince was taking a stroll along the river near the castle and dropped the key in the water which sank deep into the mud on the riverbed. Returning to the castle to put the newest citizen's valuables into the dungeon, he realized he no longer had the key! Word got around town that no one was able to access their valuables. This caused quite a stir among the townspeople, who amassed at the castle gates demanding they be returned their valuables.
  
  The prince, afraid of what this might mean, hid in his throne room and pretended the people he meant to help didn't exist, all the while regretting the fact that he had rejected the help of others due to a lack of trust. If only more than one person had a copy of the key, all of the townspeople would still have their valuables.
  
  Totally unrelated story. I just hope it makes you feel better.

I couldn't agree with this more.

As a developer working in Bitcoin, I find it difficult to take this guy seriously when I see "pseudocode" like this.

Well firstly, language is a big choice right now. If you're looking to make a financially fulfilling career in a young company or on your own, I'd recommend learning javascript to later use node.js, and learning ruby. Personally, I'm a node.js developer, so I would recommend moving toward the JS world and using really cool things like socket.io and mongoDB. Ruby is a fantastic language overall. It's a bit slow, but it does a great job regardless, and tons of really cool startups use it. At the moment, I would say that these are the two most profitable paths to take in web development.
 is a fantastic place to start. It does a great job at teaching the fundamentals of programming. If I recall correctly, the javascript courses take you from the absolute basics to building some kind of useful application, such as a calculator or todo list.
Once you've made your way through the tutorials at codeacademy, move on to  Their tutorials are a bit more advanced, and leave you with a real application and real knowledge on how to take an idea and turn it into a real product. For node magic after you've moved through Codeschool, check out 
Here are a few books I would recommend
* [Javascript: The Good Parts](
* [Node.js in Action](
* [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](
* [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](

I'm REALLY not a fan of python. The language itself isn't bad per se, but it's not backwards compatible, making being a python dev a hard life.

One can believe in Bitcoin and simultaneously be concerned about price dips. Believing in it doesn't make you immune from concern.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:44:46
That doesn't say anything. If I create a wallet and never access it again, what good does that do?

I'm a developer working with bitcoin and would be more than happy to provide some great resources for someone looking to get into it.

Don't buy a house outright. Get a loan, which will improve your credit, and the Bitcoin you don't spend on buying it outright will outperform the interest on the loan.
Edit: As far as the wife situation, it's not my business to tell you what you should do with your wife.

What a petty and shitty thing to do.

Note what I said about interest.

Sorry bro, but that's part of being a MSB. It's not like they have a choice.
