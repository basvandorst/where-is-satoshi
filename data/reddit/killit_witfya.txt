yep my grandpa was forced to work as a bitcoin miner at age 14 and got paid 3 satoshi per day. and that was a lot of money back then.
@_date: 2015-12-17 13:07:31
this happened over a year ago. why is it here now?
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:06:56
silk road and gox have been connected in the past so thats probably how
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:45:07
99% secure 1% scalability. im sure this will work out great
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:28:45
does anyone know if btc38 supported direct cny bank deposit before today?
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:43:21
haha ummm yeah lets all buy the coin right before the giant dump! good idea
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:22:48
bitcoins block size doesnt matter. i dont even know why people bring up the extra blocksize segwit adds because even at 100% adoption its only 25tx per second. the path now is off chain and store of value
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:07:44
actually its the miners fault! they are creating new bitcoins and inflating the market! stop mining! if everyone stops mining there will be no new bitcoins to drop the value! high five bro we got this figured out!
@_date: 2018-05-20 05:48:55
you guys are really cherry picking for positive data at this point
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:28:11
which just also happens to coincidentally be the date included in the rumor for halts on all direct bank deposits of CNY to exchanges? FML
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:47:53
you clearly dont get it. for someone who bought at $150 they are just going to dump to the highest buy possible. All the orders will go immediately to market for instant profit.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:03:51
well the trick is to deposit btc, trade btc/usd, then withdraw btc
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:29:30
youre sure btc38 supported method A?
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:47:01
2nd layer or bigger blocks
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:31:13
wtf is mxn?.... nevermind its peso. strange acronym
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:04:24
dont worry your funds arent going anywhere

3rd party is not direct bank
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:28:16

yeah tradingview is the shizz
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:41:38
Actually I just BTC China not making announcement today! So there you have it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:46:18
Time to sell your coins and take a xanax
@_date: 2014-04-03 20:53:25
its gone? huobi btcchina and okcoin all shut down?
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:18:16
because the situation will be the first to dump gets the most profit and last to dump gets the least profit.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:34:18
yeah it was probably around 30 40 cents at the time i guess or else that wouldnt have made much sense. maybe its in bitbet history. either way their system sucks
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:50:04
wow when will people stop thinking that exchange volume means "new money coming in"
@_date: 2014-04-09 06:17:01
did bitcoin hit $0?
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:31:54
i just sold everything. thank you.
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:17:43
anytime someone says "i tried to warn you" or "you didnt listen to me" i immediately think giant douchebag
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:15:59
didnt read the link but just saying that bitbet's odds system favors people who bet first. I bet that litecoin would reach $1 by the end of 2014 when it was at ten cents and it only netted me 1.2x my money! even though it was 10:1 odds at the time. Wonder what the odds were that it would hit $40? :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:03:21
i always liked "crobits" for microbitcoins
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:13:38
you read imaginary chinese? everything i seen was about 3rd party processors except perhaps the bter notice? i never did get an answer on that whether they accepted direct cny deposits in the first place
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:50:43
i like crobits
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:14:10
I completely agree this website constantly infuriates me because of how many times I've had to correct people who say things like "the Chinese are buying up bitcoinz! "
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:10:56
really because i trade btc/usd all day on btc-e
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:56:18
mine was lowered from 10btc to 1btc so $50k was never a factor
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:13:25
i think its more likely the coins have already been sold on other exchanges than hoarded.
@_date: 2014-04-22 07:33:49
so stop using btc-e because someone sold btc there....... umm ok
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:29:49
yes i am and i meant to say fortress. had pantera in my head from something else i guess
@_date: 2014-05-13 07:38:43
@_date: 2015-01-22 12:39:28
pantera admitted to dropping 30M for coins in november 2013, and then proceeded to sell most the coins to reinvest in bitcoin related companies in 2014
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:09:47
so a ticker symbol is more important than majority hashrate now?
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:22:17
zeroblock glitch
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:09:46
this is true. definitely wont be taking this too seriously until i see the classic nodes jump
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:48:08
looks like the miners will decide after all. oh wait are we not saying that anymore? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:13:33
you should link people to this article instead of your usual condescending retorts  
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:19:53
why would an altcoin nullify the agreement? that makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:20:55
near to zero? 80% of ETH's volume is in fiat, not bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-06 02:14:08
$50 fees is not unscathed if we're talking about adoption
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:43:16
black and white laser printers are cheap and great. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:37:57
some people need to be directed to look at the giant red flags waving in their face
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:02:21
maybe core devs should consider making asicboost available in segwit. since thats the only reason why bitmain is blocking segwit right? make the miners happy and the users at the same time? hmmmm or maybe asicboost has nothing to do with this since its been public since april 2016
@_date: 2017-04-14 18:58:18
as a r/btc guy i think its hilarious every post yesterday was "UASF NOW!!!" with everyone wearing UASF hats and today uasf is a bad idea. what changed? 
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:13:12
bitfinex being hacked last year but never determining who the perpetrators were other than 'someone on the inside'. them settling their bfx token hours before disabling usd wire withdrawals. also what is the reason wells fargo disabled wires anyway? they just disabled without a single explanation? curious
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:35:02

theymos is reddit admin?

good point
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:20:02
this makes too much sense.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:03:37
its out on 4k  hdr now. treat yoself
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:48:07
does it need visiblilty? it reeks of bullshit. who gets audited 1 week after tax deadline day
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:26:26
im not saying youre lying but ive been buying and selling btc on both coinbase and gemini using pnc checking account for 4 years with no problem
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:27:05
yeah thats rough. i wonder if i will be spared since i paid them a buttload. this type of thing is exactly why i tried to do it as legit as i could. i weighed the options in my head for a few months and i just didnt want to live with that fear hanging over my head.
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:54:54
i feel like the tax law before the recent change was too murky to claim every single crypto to crypto trade. it seems fairly clear in the 2018 law though and i no longer make willy nilly trades (especially on exchanges that have my name registered). maybe using the bitcoin tax website is the key the irs probably took one look at that return and said f this and tossed it aside
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:47:38
also fuck getting thrown in jail for not paying taxes
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:24:12
they were great back in 2013 because you could ACH transfer direct to bank account without even giving your name
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:50:27
ok sorry to hear it i was more skeptical of the OPs tone and accompanying message 
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:49:40
ok i compared the risks. i have determined i am not going to be thrown in jail for bad trades and investments and cannot lose more than i invested so they really dont compare
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:57:34
how does good news explain resistance
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:48:44
if you feel that way you probably shouldnt be a citizen anyway
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:57:12
70% of miners have questions
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:27:28
congrats on the upcoming launch!
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:33:00
whale club is a bunch of nerds drawing random triangles all over a chart. theyre wrong 99% of the time. some people even say things like "price should move up or down from this point" and draw one line up and one line down. other people draw a squiggly line that goes all over for their prediction. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:50:22
simplicity i guess
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:57:23
as opposed to here where people just say 'shitcoin, nobody cares.'
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:51:29
how do you know he wasnt framed? personally i find it hard to believe he kept a diary of all his illegal activities.
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:11:37
im sure it is in the climate controlled echo chamber
@_date: 2013-12-28 05:40:54
i agree with you 100% about huobi. if it gets shut down we will se an epic crash. everything the pboc does is about tightening regulations so its not looking good.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:17:21
90% to me says the war is over
@_date: 2013-12-28 07:10:34
i didnt say it wouldnt bounce back.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:50:28
sitting on usd was a horrible idea!
@_date: 2013-12-25 09:12:53
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:17:02
bitcoin still doesnt have a good margins/options market. bitfinex's funds do not meet wallstreets demands. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:21:45
as long as youre sittin on usd youll be ok. i cant see btc rising at this point
