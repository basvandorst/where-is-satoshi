I know women think differently from men, and we connect best with other women.  Last week, I attended and spoke on quite a few panels exactly on this topic.   The women attending felt like the men were not hearing them or reaching them pretty much across the board.  We are an integral part of the community, and should be welcomed.  Women also manage a lot of household budgets, so simply to expand the market, they should be catered to.  Some of the comments below seem borderline aggressive and rude.  If you want us to show up at the party, be pleasant lol :)

I loved being on this panel.  One of the cool things was just how electric the air felt after.  We were all really hopped up, the audience was really engaged.  One day there will be a lot more people at these types of talks, so it was nice to be able to connect more personally with everyone.  It's a new world, it's like we are all explorers together.  Can't wait to do more!

This was such a fun show to do, love getting to learn about innovations I would never have known about.

Finally, some sanity.  Miki77miki actually knows what he/she's talking about.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:23:32
You don't have the facts.  There was no trial or conviction for this.  Do your research.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:26:27
No trial or conviction for this.  Please do your research.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:36:17
You are incorrect.  Do your research.

@_date: 2017-05-23 10:49:34
Proof of that?  Oh wait, there is none.  In fact, Silk Road reduced violence, studies show:

You don't know what you're talking about.  Do research, he was never tried or convicted.  It was just used to smear him.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:33:47
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:27:56
Never went to trial or convicted for murder for hire.  Sad that people here posting are not aware of this fact.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:28:27
No he didn't, he was never tried or convicted of this
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:47:34
Innocent until proven guilty.  Also, site evidence was tampered with.  There were no children for sale or any of that.  Do your research.  
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:23:09
He didn't, he was never tried or convicted.  Do some research, its out there.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:48:59
never tried or convicted of murder for hire, and the govt themselves said no murders occurred.  Do your research.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:29:13
evidence was tampered with.  
Never convicted or tried for murder for hire either.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:41:45
I would say the deep web is the most accurate as well as Reason's coverage.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:51:07
Seems hard if he was DPR to log in from prison don't you think?  Considering they put him in solitary and he has no access to the internet.  Do your research.  Innocent until proven guilty, and he was never convicted of murder for hire.  Or tried for that matter.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:45:03
evidence of government tampering w evidence: 
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:29:58
Never tried or convicted for murder for hire, though they gave him an insane sentence for all non-violent crimes.  Evidence was also tampered with.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:14:53
Cause he was never tried or convicted for it.

The largest actual dealer on the site was given 10 years.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:32:33
Do research.  The site reduced violence.  
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:27:47
They did studies that proved that it made things safer.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:28:22

No he wasn't selling or buying drugs.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:52:25
Chuck Schumer was the one who went nuts and got him.  I find it suspect because Bitcoin was going up in value because of the silk road and Chuck was on the banking committee.  Seems like his interest was more for protecting his bank cartel friends.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:19:04
It's your fault for being a drug addict.  No one showed up at your house and forced you.  Also, he was never convicted or even tried for murder for hire.  The ignorance on here is ridiculous.  Also, there's proof of his evidence being tampered with.  You may not like drugs (though your use of them belies that maybe you do), but no one was forced to use the site.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:33:15
Finally an intelligent comment.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:39:57
Evidence of government tampering w digital evidence.  Can't trust their records.  This is America, innocent until proven guilty.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:38:57
There was no human trafficking on the site.  We don't know the level of his involvement because the trial was a joke too.  Do your research please.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:20:07
He was never tried or convicted, don't believe the nonsense.  Do research.  The site had studies done and it reduced violence.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:20:18
Do some research, never tried and convicted.

No he didn't, he was never tried or convicted of this.  Can't use it against him, and yet the government mentions it in the sentencing, though he never was convicted.  It's a crazy miscarriage of justice. Do your research.   Also, there is evidence of government tampering.

  Tampering of evidence has been proven.  Why would corrupt agents NOT fake this?  Come on now, never tried or convicted for this.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:38:18
No the site specifically forbid it.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:22:04
He was never tried or convicted for murder for hire, all non-violent charges.  And yes, the government did more than just stage crimes, there's evidence of tampering.

Doesn't the CIA sell heroin and shit?

Great way of maligning him (seems like it's working :(

Offenders typically spend at least 10 years in prison, although mandatory minimum sentences for attempting to murder a public official may be 10 to 15 years. Source:

Studies done showed it made the drug trade far safer.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:27:23
Digital evidence can be tampered with, as shown here: 
Also, never tried or convicted for murder for hire.  Considering how hard they punished him, seems more than strange that they never took that part to trial.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:34:22
It's total fiction.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:43:35
The drug war is a blight on humanity that incentivized violent cartels.  The penalties are insane and it's basically a slave camp where they put non-violent "criminals" and force them to work for 10 cents an hour or they get put in the shu.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:25:08
No he didn't do your research.  No trial or conviction of anything violent including murder for hire.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:28:08
Cause he was never tried or convicted of this
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:15:49
He was never tried or convicted of the hitman thing, and even if that happened, actual murderers don't get double life.  Don't be ridiculous.  All non-violent charges.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:16:47
You are uninformed.  Please do research before commenting lest you look like a fool.  He was never tried or convicted of attempted murder, nor murder for hire.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:38:05
Excellent film.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:47:54
Miki for the win
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:28:13
The judge was wrong and the fact is he was never tried or convicted.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:20:28
No.  He was never tried or convicted.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:17:22
How do you know?  Agents were corrupt and there's actual proof that they tampered w evidence.

So is Walmart's CEO going to be held responsible for people buying a knife or a gun in their store?  Transferred intent is a slippery slope.
