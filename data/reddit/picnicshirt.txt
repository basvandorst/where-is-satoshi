Is my understanding of this correct?
Earn/pay for things in LTC then atomic swap to BTC with 0 fees?

*Bitcoin Cash
Legacy Bitcoin has been taken over by hostile government-related third parties.

Core really just needs to take an L and walk away from the Lightning Network vaporware... It's fucking embarrassing (but so hilarious to watch).

"I'd like to take exception to your first comment, that bitcoin core developers are some of the best in the world. That is ABSOLUTELY really not true, they took bitcoin, which used to have fast, reliable transactions, on-chain. And they turned it into this incredibly congested network... And in that time bitcoin went from 100% market share to less than 50%... by that standard i think they are one of the worst development teams in the cryptocoin ecosystems." - RV
That is a bold statement that it's core developers fault bitcoin is popular and overloaded with fees currently. And also that it's their fault that other coins were able to take some market share.

yea some coins like EOS dont allow US customers to buy through their ICO so exchanges were the only way. Not that they are closing off its doing to slow things down

Guys, the majority of Bitcoin holders, especially Coinbase customers, won't be selling Bcash as you think.. Its a perfect hedge against all promising Bitcoin Core developments. If Segwit along with LN don't work as we expect, Butcoin Core will have to increase block size..﻿

Today I discovered that SegWit is not a witty relative of SegWay. Thanks ;)

There were warnings at the end of 2016 also and look what happened. Nobody knows.
