It's not that hard to understand.. basically he's saying a lot of so-called "experts" like to criticize Bitcoin's design. 
In particular the way addresses are hashed from public keys.
The truth is Satoshi was a genius when it came to cryptography.
He combined a government cipher SHA256 and a public/academic cipher RIPEMD160. That way if you don't trust the NSA you still have a public cipher and if you don't trust the public cipher you have the government cipher.
Here is the real genius:
Suppose RIPEMD160 was broken. Suppose you can instantly reverse an address to it's SHA256 hash.
Great. But you still need to reverse the SHA256 hash into a public key. There will be on average 296 public keys that hash into the address. So you still need to do a brute force search through 2160 keys to find a private key!
Now suppose both RIPEMD160 and SHA256 are broken. You can reverse an address into it's public key. That's great but you still cannot recover the private key without solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem. Or you can brute force private keys but that is 2160 work!
Birthday Paradox collision attacks are also futile from an attacker's perspective.
He also chose the secp256k1 curve which is NOT a NSA curve. In fact there are no magic numbers in this curve which means it's very very VERY unlikely to be backdoored.
This leads me to believe Satoshi is somebody from the cryptography community. You need to be a real expert to come up with such a secure scheme.
Also I know ECC is not quantum resistant but the address scheme is still secure when addresses are only spent from once. Even today nobody builds quantum resistant systems so we shouldn't expect Satoshi to 9 years ago.
