Just use Gdax.  You can use your coinbase account and there’s no fees

In my personal opinion it will  hit 100K .

Your opinion has no impact on the market. You act like you can see the future. 
Emotions and investing should separate.

I mean to be fair I bought my mom (who is a grandma) bitcoin at $7000, and she is happy with her $100 purchase.
I think the more it gains traction, the more the value will grow. I buy about $10 every day during the daily lows.

I don’t want or need anything, I’m just on for the ride.

I think so.

Any user storing Bitcoin on Coinbase at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the new Bitcoin2x asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain. No action is required - we will automatically credit your account. If you have 5 Bitcoin stored on Coinbase before the fork, you will have 5 Bitcoin and 5 Bitcoin2x following the event.

Nobody knows what the price is going to do.
Invest what you can afford to lose and try not to spend too much time thinking about it.

Buy low and watch your money grow.

I wire transfer $$$ to my USD wallet on coinbase for the lowest fee.
Then transfer the $$ into GDAX and buy BTC free of fees.
Sending coins or fiat between coinbase And GDAX is instant as they are the same company and you log in with your same account.

"According to Bloomberg China reporter Lulu Yilun Chen, bitcoin exchanges OKCoin and Huobi said they have not received shut down notices from the government and are still operating as normal. Regional cryptocurrency news source cnLedger contacted the exchanges and confirmed that they are functioning normally."
All hearsay so far , no official report from the government.

Yes thank you for this . 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:47:15
It's bitcoin this is what it does.
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:18:25
I'm waiting for it to go lower to buy more. Everything's at all time high, bad time to buy.

Don’t take financial advice from random people on the internet...
Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.
Nobody knows what’s going to happen to the price.

Yes thank you for this . 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:34:34
Yeah seeing 5k is cool, but just remember we were at 3600 a week or so ago, and 1800 a month before that. Drops like that are the best time to buy imo.
But drops are relative to the current price

1.Get you bank account approved on coinbase
2.Bank wire funds to coinbase USD wallet.
3. Transfer USD onto GDAX(same acc as coinbase)
4.Buy BTC on GDAX and send to electrum wallet with NO FEES!!
5.HANG ON, or do whatever you want is your money right.

Thank you!, also being unfamiliar with buying bitcoin is there a  best place to buy with lowest transaction fees? Is Cex.io as good as the rest?
