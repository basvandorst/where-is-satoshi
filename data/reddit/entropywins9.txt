Picking a reversal, bottom or top, is not simple.
Algo trend/momentum strats that attempt this are wrong 70% of the time, but hold their winners.
You got lucky picking 250 last time. Bottom could have been 400, could have been 100.
And this time, BTC has a **much** higher profile and mainstream respectibility.
In 2014-16, you did not have the world watching. 
This time you are competing with every financial institution and retail punter who saw the 10 billion 900 billion run and wants exposure and will try to front run the bottom.

Anyone who has ever bought or sold in a market has seen the concept of front running. It applies to every time scale.
Professionals taking large positions have sophisticated algos to break up their orders over time to minimize the effect of their position on price.
They dont say "I'm waiting for 3000" and then place one giant limit or market order.

If you bought the top, dont sweat it. Learn from your mistakes, zoom out, and try to buy low and if you need to sell, sell high.
History shows that DCA-ing and accumulating during a bear run pays off, even if it takes a couple years.
Crypto still has another parabolic run or two.
Doesn't really matter if the bottom is 6000 or 5000 or 3000, just DCA.

This is a bear market. Historically, people who accumulated during a bear market, did very well eventually, even if it took several years.

I think it is bullish.
Arbitrage will tend to link the spot and derivatives markets.
If the underlying fundamentals of BTC are strong, and I believe long term they are, then over time more $ in the derivatives market will be biased long rather than short, and that will drive more money to long spot BTC due to arbitrage.
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:16:09
[Statistical arbitrage]( / mean reversion. You backtest strategies on two (or more) assets that tend to be (either positively or negatively) correlated, and see if your algo would have yielded a profit, then forward test it to see if your settings still seem to work.
You don't even have to trade both instruments, you can trade just one, although most strategies would trade both. If the legacy institution is using USD as margin, if a strategy involves buying and selling the derivative instrument and also spot on a spot exchange, if funds needed to be rebalanced, just buy or sell the spot on the spot exchange and transfer USD between the two.
If the swap is far below the spot, bots will buy the swap and/or sell the spot and if it's far above, they will sell the swap and/or buy the spot.
The swap is meaningless if it has no connection to the spot price of the underlying, so there is a funding and/or settlement mechanism to tie the two together and incentivize mean reversion.

definitely, this is just a description of a stop hunt algo... will not work 100% of the time, but surely there are algos to accumulate either a long or short position, then place a large enough market buy or sell on a few exchanges, then trigger liquidation/stop cascade, and close position at a roundtrip profit.

I used to respect Krugman and read his column occasionally.
Until I got into crypto last year. I had no idea how nasty and uninformed Krugman could be.
What does he care if people support crypto? He writes like the crypto movement is an existential threat to him personally.
What would he prefer, governments outlaw crypto?
Isn't Krugman supposed to be a progressive economist who cares about the well being of the people?
If so, why would he not support a technological revolution that can shift power **to** the people, away from globally dominant financial corporations who have a poor track record of doing anything but maximizing their profits and fees and socializing their losses?
He always comes back to that BTC is deflationary and volatile.
So what? It's not trying to be USD, that is the point. Apologies to BTC uber maximalists, but central banks are not going anywhere, so Krugman's concerns are the result of a false dichotomy fallacy.
Crypto can complement and serve as an increasingly important competitor to the current financial system, like Amazon is a competitor to the retail companies that existed prior.
Crypto can grow another two orders of magnitude at least without completely displacing the current world financial system, which would likely lead to bad consequences anyway as States took increasing steps to protect their power.

This is very true. All that is going on in the US Senate right now, with the Supreme Court, just boils down to power.
And going after crypto exchanges is about power too, as they pose some threat to the status quo financial system- probably not a total replacement, but they will reduce growth in the banking and payments sector, as well as dislodge rent seekers in other businesses that can be decentralized.
Shutting down crypto exchanges that do not serve US IP's is overreach though, and as has been mentioned, a brash insult to sovereignty.

It is not nearly as easy or inexpensive as you imply to carry out a 51 attack, your site should have a disclaimer explaining this, unless you have some ulterior motive ie bitcoin maximalism.
The listed hashrates are inaccurately low. crypto51app lists QRL hashrate as 5 MH/s when it has been 10-20 MH/s for two weeks now
Also the prices listed are completely misleading, it would in practice cost 4x as much and usually not even be possible to 51 attack because Nicehash is a continuous auction. The available hashpower for a market cannot be taken by one person for the current price, the price rises rapidly as other buyers and bots outbid the person attempting attack.
For instance, try entering a fixed order for 10 MH/s on Cnv7: 
You can't, the most you can do is 7, because Nicehash only reserves ~30% of hashpower for fixed (guaranteed) orders, and there are already orders in place, and price nearly doubles from .02 to .0348 if you attempt to take all the fixed hashpower. At times not even this much hashpower is available and it will simply say 'not enough hashpower available.' Ifsomeone tries to place a standard order, they will often start a bidding war.
Moreover, exchanges can easily implement scripts to determine if a currency's hashrate shows suspicious activity, whether someone is likely hashing at a loss, and then simply extend confirmation times for deposits.
I do agree however though that PoS/PoW hybrids and/or delayed block submission penalties ought to be implemented if they can disincentivize double spend attacks.
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:33:05

The futures and derivatives aren't bitcoin, they are bets about the price of bitcoin. They don't provide the benefits of bitcoin (be your own bank, 10 minute transaction anywhere in the world peer to peer, an asset that resists seizure and censorship, etc)

That is not how the code works.
There is a built-in [difficulty adjustment]( that ensures the proportional reward for hashpower will always decrease as the total network hashrate increases, and vice versa. When price increases, the total network hashpower will increase, and the proportional reward will go down, so miners will always have to keep their energy costs as low as possible.
Miners will thus always concentrate where energy is the cheapest, because there is always an equilibrium between the marginal cost of hashpower, the total network hashrate, and the price on exchange.
In any case, Proof-of-Stake or PoW/PoS hybrid cryptocurrencies will continue to increase in market share, rendering the ecological argument against crypto null and void. Ethereum, for example, is [moving to Proof-of-Stake,]( phasing out the mining component.

Not many analysts thought 6K would hold. decreasing volumes, lower lows on that wedge for 10 straight months. I thought it would drop to 4K or 3K over the next 6 months. As violent and sudden as it was, and with recession fears looming, I think it may bottom out anywhere between 1K and 3K.
But eventually the same whales and bitfinex/bitmex shorts driving the price lower, are just going to pivot and start buying- there are a lot of people who sold above 10K sitting on piles of money, as well as the money they've made shorting the way down.
My plan is dollar cost average in, not buy a lump sum at once- and my time horizon is 3-5 years. My thesis is that BTC will be over 10K again and probably over 20K again, perhaps as high as 60K at some point in the next 3-5 years- just based on that log chart and the fact that, gamblers mentality, even the people who lost money are going to want to make it back.
Look at the [r/BitcoinMarkets thread when it bottomed at 150 in 2015]( plenty of people were selling. It was chaos. Those who bought, did quite well, 100x gains.
I'm not buying much BTC currently at these prices, however- there is another very small cap alt project I follow closely, that I think is going to bounce 100% soon regardless of BTC price.

You may get more technical answers on r/BitcoinMarkets.
Cryptocurrency is an emerging asset class, nobody knows how to value it. I use a % range of total crypto market cap, and a % range of global assets.
Start by looking at the [historical log chart]( There is a clear pattern of parabolic run ups followed by bear market troughs. The chart suggests this is a good time to *start* buying- we may bottom significantly lower, we may not, but we do appear to be oversold.
My thesis is that Bitcoin continues its growth, reaching somewhere between $40,000 and $100,000 at the peak of the next bull run, which I would estimate to occur between 2020-2022.
There are certainly bear cases (nation states attack cryptocurrencies, black swan quantum computer attacks occur before encryption schemes can be upgraded), but I don't see governments restricting crypto-assets any more than they have restricted the internet- both are engines for economic growth.
Based on the unique properties of this new asset class* (some of which are listed below), I think cryptocurrency reaches an equilibrium of 0.2% to 1% of total global assets, so $2 trillion to $10 trillion. If Bitcoin retains 50% market cap, and there are 17 million BTC (there will be some mining inflation, but also some out of circulation from lost coins), that suggests a long term price between $100,000 and $500,000.
Bitcoin has first mover advantage and the strongest network by far- but in the longer-term, it might not retain 50% market share, so I might adjust my forecast of where BTC stabilizes at between $40,000 and $200,000- but this would increase subject to growth in total world assets. One can hedge against BTC losing some market share by picking a few promising alts as well, but this requires research.

But there is also clearly an army of organized anti-bitcoin shills. Honestly if you spend a lot of time on any sub where any business or entity might have a commercial or political or financial angle,  it's only a matter of time before some astroturfing campaign is called out and unmasked.

You buy the bottom and sell the top, not the other way around.
It's the same with any tradable asset in existence. No, nobody can time it exactly, but just look at the log chart, its pretty clear that you sell after a parabolic run and buy the bear market afterwards.
If your thesis is that 20K was peak BTC ever, then great, don't buy it- thats the wonderful thing about markets, you make your bets, I make mine.
I know people who made literally 1000x gains in 12 months on some of those alts you are talking about, during the last bull run, and now they are looking for which projects to buy into for the next run up, whenever it comes.

1 is by far the better investment, because that $1000 gain represents a **200%** return on investment, whereas the $2000 gain is only a **20%** return.
The denomination/unit gain is arbitrary, percent return on investment is the **only** thing that matters in investing, and logarithmic scale is the only way to accurately compare percent return on investment at various points in an assets history.

To be fair, if you bought $10,000 worth of Dogecoin in May 2015 at 0.008 cents/Doge, and solt it last Jan at 1.9 cents/Doge, you would be sitting on $2.3 million right now.

Price is now $4000 after a year above $6000.

Yes I lost my respect for Paul Krugman when I read his ill-researched anti-bitcoin ravings. 
Personally I love how, as you mention, cryptocurrency can unite people across the political spectrum, from conservative to libertarian to progressive, for various overlapping reasons. In these partisan times, there are not that many things that can do that.
Unfortunately, the crypto-haters seem to derive from across the political spectrum too, but most of them do not really understand bitcoin- it's the typical hostility to the unknown, mixed with envy of wealthy early adopters.

There are actually quite a few differences.
Cryptocurrencies combine advantages of bank deposits and physical cash that neither possess on their own:
1. Funds are not affected by counterparty risk (bank insolvency, etc)
2. Funds cannot easily be confiscated by hostile regimes.
3. Transactions cannot be censored or blocked.
4. Transfers can be relatively anonymous.
5. Transfers can be irrevocable.
6. Transfers can occur relatively instantly.
7. Transfers can occur 24/7, 365 days per year.
8. Anyone can use the system, without seeking permission.
9. Payments can be made over the internet
10. Change does not need to be calculated.
11. Payments can be easily recorded and automated programmatically.


I beg to differ. 
Merriam Websters defines *decentralization* as *the dispersion or distribution of functions and powers,* and, as I stated, though there is no such thing as *perfect* decentralization or perfect anything for that matter, open-source cryptocurrencies are clearly not as centralized as are nationally chartered US banks or the Executive Branch of the Federal Government.

Will some new businesses shut down? Of course, that's the way of the world- how many of any of this list of [ycombinator-funded tech startups]( do you think are still operating, or will be in 5 years? And those are the cream of the crop of startups, yet most will still fail.
But, "kill" the industry?
Again, there will always be miners in profit, period, that's how the code works. This is the fifth time BTC has had a parabolic run and then an 80% correction, yet every block has been mined.

Not middle class income, and certainly not enough to keep up with the rise in housing, medical, and education prices- in other words, the most expensive yet inevitable costs of living.
Median Home Price in 2000 was $100,000, now it is &gt; $200,000
The cost of a College Degree has increased [1,100%](Cost Of College Degree In U.S. Has Increased 1,120 Percent In 30 Years) in the past 30 years.

The people who have been buying the bear troughs following bitcoins parabolic runs, vs the people who have sold the bottom thinking that was the last runup and bitcoin will become worthless, are winning 4-0 at this point, and the profits that bear trough buyers have earned are between [100% and 10,000%]( each time.
Bitcoin has 10x-ed literally seven times since the first recorded bitcoin transaction took place less than a decade ago.
Eventually, crypto will reach a more stable equilibrium with world assets, and this radical price discovery exponential growth phase will end.
I am betting that that equilibrium is not at a $100 billion market cap, but rather closer to $2-10 trillion.

People win points in my book for "getting" bitcoin, regardless of their politics. It can be a unifying force.
BTC decentralizes power away from big banks and corporation- progressives and hippies can like that. Bitcoin empowers individuals over governments- libertarians and conservatives can like that. Bitcoin is not inflatable by central banks- Austrian School goldbug types can like that. Bitcoin is a technological upgrade to 'money/value/transaction'- techno-utopians can like that.
It's rare, these days, for people from diverse political leanings to find common ground in anything.

Those of us buying bitcoin now, are betting that there is a strong chance 20K was not the top. This is just what Bitcoin/USD does- price has increased exponentially, 10xing literally 7 times since the first transaction at 1/4 of a cent, but in boom and bust cycles.
We have been through the following correction cycles already, starting in 2011- 
$32 to $2
$7 to $4
$15 to $7
$230 to $35
$1100 to $150
Note that if you bought during the bear market following the blow off tops, you were rewarded with significant gains. Those are the points however, much like now, that the public and media are at peak anti-Bitcoin sentiment- it is hard to buy an asset that is losing value, though historically, that has been the best time to start accumulating.
This is an emerging asset class with unique properties, and my thesis is that Bitcoin has a probability-weighted net present value significantly higher than $3000, although we may reach $2000 or even $1000 in this current correction cycle, because obviously $750 to $20,000 in 12 months was overbought.

Chase Bank or the US Federal Government are a central authority.
Miners, holders, exchanges, core devs, etc, are not a central authority, they are various independent autonomous parties pursuing their own interests within a game theoretical model, which happens to make the protocol work.
No, there is no such thing as *perfect* decentralization, but you are merely making a facile semantic point, the argument from perfection fallacy.
Cryptocurrencies are not perfectly decentralized, but they provide the individual with vastly more autonomy and control than do legacy finance systems.

I have crafted algo's and traded via API, the thing is, it's a free market. If you make your bot do X behavior, everyone else's bots can learn from this.
There is no way to 'manipulate.' Yes whales can push price up or down and cause liquidation cascades. People can flash walls and pull them. So what? 
It is a truly free market, and we don't want the nanny state to try to come in and enforce their own idea of how the market ought to behave.

The code does not work that way.
Mining cost is dynamic and adjusts- there will always be an equilibrium between exchange price, marginal cost to mine a block, and total network hashrate.
So there will always be miners in profit, whether the price of bitcoin is $2 or $20,0000. When price decreases, less efficient miners shut down, the total hashrate drops, and the difficulty adjusts downward, making it easier to mine a block, and vice versa when price increases.

Those who bought during the bear troughs have done better than any other asset class the past ten years.
This thing has done 100% - %10,000 parabolic runs followed by 80-90% drawdowns five times now, [2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and now 2018]( its nothing new.
Panic selling the bottom makes you just as much a sucker as FOMO buying the top.
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:18:24
Yes, hashrate and difficulty (as a factor of marginal hash cost) are going to follow price, not the other way around.

Yeah I call bullshit/FUD, OP obviously made this up.
Nobody sells a house to invest- a) it usually takes months to list and then close on a property, b) you could just take a home equity loan or mortgage against the home if you need cash.
This sub is *obviously* full of fake accounts, they've been at it for years (as BTC rose from 1/4 cent to thousands of dollars)- banksters must be getting desperate, fiat inflation never stops and we are on the verge of another recession that will require mountains of new debt and quantitative easing.

Plenty of assets have value whilst not being currencies.
BTC is censorship-resistant transactable, fixed-supply store of value, and the most secure settlement network on the planet.
I can't use a T-bill or an ounce of gold to pay at starbucks, but that does not mean they aren't valuable.

If free adults want to send money to a sports betting website, or buy bitcoin at $20,000 or tech stocks at absurd 200x Price/Earnings ratios, or play powerball, let them make that choice.
