I don't wish to be unkind, but you are exactly the sort of person that should not invest in bitcoin. You are investing for all the wrong reasons, without a clue about the technology or the long and winding price story. To invest in bitcoin to pay off debt is simply madness.

Ermm..that would kind of go against any kind of supply and demand that I am aware of. If there are more buyers than sellers, prices always go up.

Isn't it possible that the teacher was not talking about a particular spec taking 1 sec, but that with all the mining power out there, it only takes 1 second on average until a miner, somewhere,  finds it ?

Sorry. I don't know what you mean. Do you have anything relevant to say ?
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:07:39
Thank you for the reply.
Just for your info, I am not a newbie. I have been following the space for quite a few years. The use cases that you describe, I completely agree with, they make sense. However, in terms of the mass adoption, i still don't quite see. How we will get there.
I see it more as gold backing currency (as gold used to). I still cannot see the leap to mass usage.

Yes I did sell some of my holding. Not right at the peak, but close to it.....

apologies for eliciting your cringe reflex.

prices rise. suckers move in. then sells occur. this is now down to a one week cycle.
Bears also defecating in woods apparently....

They are only perfect bedfellows in the sense that sure, it makes sense for banks to move over to an electronic currency, if they feel it gives them benefits. ie they can control it, they can inflate/deflate it for their own ends and heck get all the advantages of non-physical, instant transactions. It's just that cryptos do not share that vision of the marital bed. Indeed they were created precisely to avoid it.
I have no doubt that some banks will attempt to create their own cryptos, but those cryptos will simply be just another flavour of the banks hegemony. I am suggesting that REAL cryptos are a challenge to that, precisely because they give freedom to the individual. We have a situation where this generation is the first in history to be poorer than it's parents generation. The reasons are many, but a big part of it, is the toxic way money is created and controlled in the west. Cryptos have the potential to free money in away that the web freed information. For it to go back to being what it was originally intended to be ie a medium of exchange and not a closed shop gangster racket...

I see many here are the 'lambos' and "to the moon" brigade, those who are not as lazy and like to do more than just mental masturbation, running a full node gives you autonomy over your own transactions (you don't need anyone else to broadcast them). More impotantly " ....they help keep the network decentralized and protect the protocol’s consensus rules. As long as enough full nodes are up and running, anyone with a modern computer can join the network as a peer and miners (as well as everyone else) are forced to follow Bitcoin’s rules. "
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:14:16
How many people here who are posting have an active node running ? if not, guys, come on. The more nodes we have the more stable and secure the network. Do your bit (excuse the pun) :-)

I agree in the most part. The difference however is that the momentum that has got us thus far, has been based on the predicted eventual adoption as a currency. We are at a hiatus, where only developments are going to move the price upwards. If the price does move upwards, people are less likely to want to part with it for obvious reasons. If they don't part with it, it is much harder to become a currency. Hence why I think it will be a store of wealth such as gold. Very few transactions, easily done, secure.
If people see things differently, I would like to know their road map. Hence my original question. If unlike me, you think bitcoin IS going to become a universal currency, can you explain, even theoretically that will happen in a step-by-step notation..
I feel we are in a catch 22 and hence why a digital store of wealth, makes more sense to me

Yes block chain tech will be utilised by the banks, that much I believe and obviously not just banks too. 
I don't see bitcoin as being something useable by the banks in it's current state. They cannot control it, they cannot inflate it. They have become too dependent on being able to manipulate fiat for obscene profits at the expense of the rest of society, I don't see them weaning themselves off that teat any time soon. 
I do expect some to banks to try backing an altcoin coin that they can control such as ripple. Good luck to them.  For me part of the genius of bitcoin is that it's something that completely floors traditional banks. If the banks try to create their own version of it, it is doomed to fail as they will not be able to help themselves with regards to inflating/debasing it, if they try to adopt bitcoin, they know they have very limited control, the best they can hope for is to provide some service layer on the top, but that seems unclear and anything to controlling will simply kill the golden goose (there are arguments in some quarters that the lightening network may ultimately result in necessary 'hubs' that would be ideal for banks, I am not sure of that either way).
In the short term I can see them using the blockchain and ethereum/neo platforms as the industry is crying out for ledger based contracts and much fat could be trimmed.
Yes, i agree with your central point, that mass adoption is not going to be the 'mass adoption' in the sense of every John Doe using some on a daily basis....

I am not that surprised or concerned about this sell off. The price is 10x what it was this time last year. What has happened since is that a lot of unsophisticated amateurs have piled in since then. They are both greedy and fearful and when you have that state of affairs, you can expect big highs (greed) and big lows (fear). The problem for too many is that they are conflating the price story, with the usability and potential of this technology. If you do this, you will never understand what is happening.
99% of the posts here are about the price. If you want to get involved with that , knock yourself out, for me, that is cart before the horse territory. If you understand the technology and believe in it, then the faith in the price will follow it. I have no truck with those that do not believe in the technology, there are huge challenges and other competing coins, for sure bitcoin has plenty of scope for failure. What I do take issue with is people using the state of the price and extrapolating out that this therefore means the technology is flawed, even if that were true, it does not follow, just because the price is going up or going down.
The price is going to be in the hands of the greedy and the fearful for some time, there is little we can do about that. If the technology however continues to improve - as I believe it will - then it will be the value proposition that determines the price and frankly that's all that ever should. Everything else is a sideshow, get sidetracked if you wish, but my point to 99% of the people here, if you are in for a quick buck, you are going to have a v. bumpy ride, if you want to play smart, read up on the technology and pick a side, whatever side you pick though, let it be based on due diligence, not on the weather vane posters  who are everywhere

I am not trying to tell the OP how to invest his money, far from it. But if you have say a pot of cash, and you can have either a cushion for something such as a loss of salary, an unexpected hospital fee or you can have a shot at investing it in one of the most volatile investments around, i would say go into it with your eyes wide open. I would also say that if you have mouths to feed, the first option may be a priority.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:19:09
on what basis is the price going to go up ? cannot see any upwards movement withoiut news. Expect another sell off this weekend. Only thing that puzzles me , is who is engaging in this down and then up game ? Who's selling knowing that it will bounce back up again, before going down again .
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:41:12
this whole up and then down is highly fishy. all coins up and then all coins down. is this just bots trading ? i am wondering. simply no logic. not based on news, good or bad.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:25:47
sorry mate, I think this weeks dump has started. Curious to know who is paying exactly for this now-weekly, pump and dump. Either you don't buy in at the moment or you hold...baffling...
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:20:08
I don't wish to be unkind. But your post is not consistent. If you needed to sell "because I could not afford to lose my initial investment after a series of financial hardships", then you made the right decision, surely ? the issue of bitcoin going back up is neither here nor there, if that is the reason you sold. 
Despite what you say, your post does seem to suggest that you are gambling with money you cannot afford to lose. Don't. Please. Just don't. Bitcoin could fall to 100 dollars, it could go to 50,000. Until we have ironed out the technical issues and got stability, it is the wild west at the moment. Do not even thinking of putting in money that may need to be family-feeding money.

think the sell off has started early this week

yep, it's a lot. but during last run up between May 01 2017 and Dec 31 2017, average monthly gain was 34%. This does not even include the peak figure of 19K. In short, there is already a precedent. Like I say, not as crazy as it sounds. Just a few months of even higher performance and the compounding effect means Mcafee prediction not as baffling as it might first appear.
