Thanks. That's what I was looking for. Seems like an approach I could try.

The fake news mainstream media is shit scared Bitcoin and trying their best to cause it to crash. Their clients--the banks are behind this. But no way. You can't stop a global movement (:

Not really. This is a newspaper in Toronto. A major one. They are using Bitcoin for marketing reason to make people think that their newspaper is forward thinking and adopted to the times......Bitcoin should sue them. If it could that is (:

That is so true. You have to let your investment go. And just trust in the world changing technology you invested. This will give you peace.

I also had doubts but I dont regret getting in ( I regret buying a high but just like you I didn't know when it will correct itself. I am in it for long term so I will get profits out of this. The volatility of this was well known before getting in. It's long term that counts. Don't sell.

Keep calm and just Hodl. I just got in as a first time invester and after 2 weeks of hard research I decided to splash 5 k into my portfolio. It took me 2 years to save that money. First ever investment into anything. I diversified it but so what.... still stings badly cause I purchased at much higher prices. I wish I bought at the current discount rate.... I really do...but in the end I will still make a decent profit on this in 2-3years. The only mistake I could do now is panic and sell. No need to take losses when Crypto is still an infant. Forget about the greed of what could have been at lower prices and just Hodl and don't even blink.

I lasted like 3 hours today (:  It was the most in weeks. But my New Years resolution will be to check price exactly once a week. At the same day/time. I am holding for years so what's the difference.

You still made a decent profit remember that.

Pis government (:  No surprise there.

You are right. It's a guessing game at the most. I tried to time the dip down from 19 k and bought at 16 k. Was worried it will spring back again.....but if you are in for the long term like me, then the worry is less. But it's impossible to know. And financial experts know very little more. Cause market is irrational.

There is Fud from Congress again. Some old politician argued that we are just a bunch of lunatics who think we will get rich. So we need to be protected. This dinosaur is like 100 years old. That’s a good part of the fud.
