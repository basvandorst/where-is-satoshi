I don’t mind not being worth talking to on the count of my opinions, strong or not...you call this bigotry and illogical and racism and whatnot, that’s fine, I respect your opinion. I call mine experience and it’s rarely proven as being prejudice. We all have our place in this world and fortunately there’s still room for everyone.

Maybe they were mining BTC on their multi-million dollar Pentium 4 servers and got hacked bcos root pwd was something along the lines of “password”
Yes, I know, even a cockroach would know better. Point is _most_ IT guys who work in banks must have half a brain missing.

See if localbitcoins works in iran, if it does that’s all you need.

Will be wetting my whites if somehow crypto bites the dust and those guys get to say i told you so

Why you posting this here? Go find some russians, they will find the guy and take his knees. If the IP you have is his real IP indeed, which would mean he was a lame script kiddie and you a dumb ass for getting owned that bad...no disrespect meant!

I get all sorts of shit emails like that one. Some surprisingly well targeted, proof those idiots do invest some time in research or have pretty well targeted lists. Stii only about 5 secs smarter than the nigerian guys.

I live in Europe and keep my “checking” at ING which is one of the largest banks around here. Have had lots of issues with others. Including Citi who ask me for $100k collateral to give me a $50k limit on a Visa card and expect me to pay interest on what I use just because I apparently am not eligible for another debit card than their shit branded cards where I’d have to drive 20 miles for an ATM because they don’t work at other banks’ ATM. And they’re not taking a piss, they really mean what they say. Go figure. You are lucky not to have with your bank the issues I have with mine. I literally have to carry cash around for situations where my cards or online banking error out or are under maintenance for hours in mid business day. Not that much of a big deal to my existence still, people have lived for thousands of years with bigger problems than mine but still, kind of annoys me when any simple question I have takes weeks to get answered and the simplest thing such as a card payment becomes soooo complicated. Not to mention the stupefied looks I get from tellers every 2 years when they demand copies of my paperwork (that expires once every 5 years) and I show them a passport instead of national ID, and I explain to them that I am an expat and I live in a different country, they act like I’ve shown them the birth cerificate of Thanos. Anyway, not a big deal like I said, just another minor should-I-laugh-or-should-I-feel-sorry-for-them moment.
Crypto is still a young platform, who knows what will happen in 10, 20, 50 years. It has some potential to disrupt the banking system though. I sure hope it does. For countless reasons.
Bottom line is I am just happy that a BTC payment takes 30 mins to “clear” as opposed to 3 business days for an international Swift payment. If I was to choose whom to hand a beer to, Satoshi Nakamoto or the IT manager at ING...you can probably guess who would get the beer and who would get the finger, regardless of their age, color or background or names they choose to call me. IDGAF.
I love everyone in the crypto community and I promise to help as much as I can. Maybe I will be lucky enough for my grand-grand-grandchildren to thank me one day and remember my name.
Anyway I’m off to bed, enjoy your evening!

Not always but compared to most government officials and all sorts of “advisors” I wouldn’t be surprised if some people from reddit or wherever would sometimes be closer to the truth...

Funny how having or not having a whitepaper makes a cryptocurrency scam or not...makes me wonder if i duct tape some paper to an empty bottle maybe i can sell it for $9k

You don’t necessarily need a separate wallet, just open a localbitcoins account for each of you, he can buy coins for cash over there and send it to the address in your account, from where you sell to some local buyer on your end. In fact you can do it with just one account, after he buys gives you the login/pwd and you select canada and sell.

Shit happens, that’s why you never invest money you can’t afford to lose in these things.
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:46:52
I hope next bank to mess up will not be the one you keep your accounts at, so you can afford the luxury of calling names whoever got bent in a way or another by the banking system and all the imbecile bloodsucking parasites who work for those select few who use the monetary system to enslave millions of people worldwide. We’ll see how good of a detective you are when some random guy with 100 certifications and 12 degrees keeps you from buying your kids’ dinner or paying for gas or rent or any of the other shit you take for granted without imagining for a second you could be deprived of simply because some moron has no clue how to do a database backup or not spill his beer on a hot server. 
Can’t wait for all this crypto shit to send most of those guys where they really belong. Flipping burgers with those fancy degrees they all have.

He may not understand it but perhaps he \(still\) has the flair to see it as a risky, volatile investment and possibly combined with regret for not having jumped in he would come out with all sorts of crap. Sadly it influences general perception to a certain extent. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:12:04
and those guys don't always know what they're talking about,more often than not they are just parasites sucking on whoever they can.

Because he’s a gazillionaire? Gotta be some sort of example of PoS in real life, whenever some senile stiff who can barely get out of his rolls says something, everyone goes awww whoaaaa
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:22:25
Whoa... don't know about all that but I think it's possible that if most IT guys who work in banks were as intelligent as you are or took their jobs as serious as you take this reddit thing, a lot of people would have less problems in this world.
Anyway if I was to insult an industry I would insult the whole banking industry without discriminating against their IT tools.

They do, i haven’t mentioned that because the us already got it sorted out some 70 years ago. Some might add other details, but I won’t, off to work
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:04:22
I doubt he has the mental capacity to understand something as technical as cryptocurrency. Not saying he is stupid, he definitely is not, but he does have a respectable age. Maybe the guy bathes in newborn blood on a daily basis or something. Because my grandma can't even figure out how to use the TV remote control at the same age.

They should “discover” some diamonds or vibranium or smth so the US will barge in with some more democracy hanging off the business end of the M16
