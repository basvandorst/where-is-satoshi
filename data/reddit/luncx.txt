"Stop calling the bitcoin a coin. It is a raw material, an asset. The purchasing power is not safeguarded. That is an essential difference with the euro. "
"We only follow the phenomenon because there may be potential consequences for financial stability. Many people call the bitcoin a coin, which makes them think we have something to do with it. "
"The bitcoin is a danger for the people who buy it. It is pure speculation, hoping to become richer. But of course there is also the risk of losing heavily. "
"The volatility is extreme, as the past weeks and months have shown. That price can rise, but also fall very hard. There is no authority - such as a central bank - that protects you. "
"We have to embrace digital innovations, but the bitcoin is a speculative expression that has nothing to do with the benefits of that technology. A debate has now arisen about whether central banks could develop digital coins themselves. In Sweden, for example, that theme is very bad because little cash is used. "
"Total loss possible"
The head of the German financial authority also warned in an interview to the Bild newspaper about the dangers of the bitcoin. "These are very speculative processes with the possibility of a total loss," said chairman Felix Hufeld.
Crypto currencies are a digital exchange medium that uses cryptography to secure transactions, create new currencies and verify transactions. Since the beginning of the year, the bitcoin has risen sharply in value: from about 1,000 US dollars to nearly 20,000 dollars, to fall short of Christmas in the direction of 12,000 dollars.
The higher the rate of the bitcoin went, the louder the warning voices from the political and banking world sounded. In recent days, politicians and economists have called for a regulation of the bitcoin.
