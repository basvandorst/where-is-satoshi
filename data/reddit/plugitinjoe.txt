Do you have to only send them digital copies of your information or do they require copies to be physically mailed to them? What else did you have to provide?

I never had a problem with Mt.Gox up until this particular instant. Transferring funds from Dwolla to Gox for me was easy and smooth, as was trading for Bitcoins. As soon as withdrawal time came around, this silliness happened.

Thank you so much. I have a complication though with utility bills, I live at home with my ole' man and the utility bills are under his name. As soon as I can get that second documentation down, I'm good to go.

What else can you provide as documentation for them?

I'm not trying to scare anybody away. That's a bit of an outrageous claim and I am only making this post to seek some help and see if other people have had a similar problem. I will post up screencaps as soon as I can to give you said proof. I just acquired my first few Bitcoins today and wanted to do a test run to ensure to ensure they transfer correctly to my computer's Bitcoin wallet. So for good measure, I tried to send one Bitcoin and maybe 15 seconds after confirming I wanted it sent, it told me that my account was under review and I could not withdraw anything. My issue with Mt.Gox is that there seems to be a fair number of other people this has happened to and that verifying your account is the only way to remove this hold, something that Mt.Gox does not inform you of this caveat before you even begin to transfer funds to them.
EDIT 1: I work for a university psychology lab. In no way would I ever wanna work for a Bitcoin company, seems too stressful

When did you set up your account? Maybe that has something to do with this.
