Seeing the responses to your post makes me cringe. Yes, it IS needed, developers are already experimenting with this to great hype and acclaim. Why do you need BTC when you have paypal? They need to be familiar with the industry and technology to believe you, otherwise you might as well be arguing about global warming to unbelievers
To answer your question, it’s already happening, but adoption will speed up greatly once the technology is authorative and trusted

I agree completely, my point was that "ETH isn't needed for gaming" is analogous to "We don't need BTC because we have paypal." I'm a game dev and I understand the reasoning behind ETH's utility. I actually got mostly finished with a project to award ERC tokens in an OBA style game, but decided to drop it due to concerns over security, as solidity was still early in development. I'm happy see people pushing forward with the concept regardless and everyone is super hyped.
Is this making sense to people seeing this? I actually develop using the technology and try to hold people's hand as to why it's important, and it get's downvoted just like I said. You might as well argue with climate change deniers or flat earthers.

The real advantage of blockchain is the decentralized part of it. Larger and larger portions of government being handed over to the power of citezens on a decentralized blockchain is completely unfathomable to many, but I could see it happening in 10 years. Think of a giant vote based system where everyone is anonymous, the blockchain program is funded by multiple sources, and the outcome is automatically pushed towards the voted program/company's wallet for use.
