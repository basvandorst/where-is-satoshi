I agree.  While it is likely to be true that the people working for changetip and even the CEO are probably nice people, that doesn't necessarily prevent the future company from changing their stance on privacy.  Bitcoiners have intelligent questions, and they need intelligent answers.  I think Changetip should do another AMA and respond directly to it's customers' concerns.

This is great, vending with cryptocurrencies is a future endeavor for sure.  But, wasn't [Bitcoin Kinetics]( working on similar projects?

All Your Data Are Belong To Us.

I heard it this way, There are more bitcoin addresses than all of the grains of sand in all of the beaches in the world, so the chances of someone else generating the same address as you are astronomical.  Also, as soon as a transaction has been posted in the blockchain, that address does exist, it simply hasn't been connected to any wallet software.

I feel for the people who lost money in this scam.  However, when a deal seems to good to be true it probably is.  This "coin" smelled of scam from the very beginning.
Reminds me of a scene from the Simpsons
Homer: Not a Bear in Sight, the Bear Patrol must be working like a charm.
Lisa: That's specious reasoning, Dad.  
Homer: Thank you dear.
Lisa: By your logic I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away. 
Homer: Oh, how does it work?
Lisa: It doesn't work. 
Homer: Uh-huh. 
Lisa: It's just a stupid rock. 
Homer: Uh-huh. 
Lisa: But I don't see any tigers around, do you? 
Homer: Lisa, I want to buy your rock.

Chris Ellis is a genius.  Pro Tip will change the micropayments space.  It's tipping the way Satoshi would have wanted it.

There sure seems to be an increasing interest in this project lately.  Pro Tip truly is the Future of Micropayments.

[World Crypto Network]( could be a good partner for this project.  WCN already has reporters from around the world bringing you direct Bitcoin/cryptocurrency news.

Pro Tip:  Actually using Bitcoin for Tipping will further Bitcoin adoption faster than off-chain (Changetip) transactions.

CCN does good work.  Glad to see them representing Crypto Media.

5 cents wow, someone must have really liked what you posted.  That's a big tip for a changetipper.
