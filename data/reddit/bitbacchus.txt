"$500 Grand Prize or $7000 in other cash prizes!!!"
Dollar signs and "cash" - no mention of the distribution in BTC in the announcement.  Just saying. If my hometown currency was EUR/GBP, I probably wouldn't care about a $ prize giveaway.  
The whole point of BTC is that 1BTC is 1BTC in Thailand, UK, Spain, or USA.  The winner could convert if he/she wishes.
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:11:33
The grand prize is $500.  Take the $500 and convert it to BTC at this moment.  Round up or down if it's necessary or makes it look nicer.  The grand prize is that amount of BTC.  We're all used to price volatility.  If, at the end of the contest, 1BTC is $400 or $600 or $300 it doesn't matter.  You win BTC, not a dollar conversion to BTC  of $500.  You already budgeted the prize money, just convert it to BTC and offer that as the prize.
Edit/Addition : it's similar to when coin stores have a contest.  It's usually something like "Win one silver eagle" or "Win one gold Canadian maple".

Crypto-currency based company offers USD prizes....
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:54:36
Ok, it's a start but I have a better suggestion:
Grand Prize : 1.25BTC
No need to make changes with volatility.  That's the prize.  If I'm in Thailand I know what the prize is.  Same as with Japan, UK, USA - doesn't matter.  I think that's the beauty of BTC is that you don't have to show allegiance to one currency, in this case, the USD.  If I'm in any country and follow Bitcoin, I instantly know what the prize is.  Maybe the guy in Thailand doesn't know that $1 is about 35.9 baht (I had to look it up).
Also, thanks for taking my suggestions.  I hope you don't think I'm trolling your contest.  I just think that Bitcoin is taking down a lot of these barriers where USD/GBP/THB exists.
1BTC=1BTC globally 
and best wishes for your contest!

If anything kills Bitcoin, it will be ASICs.  The day that FPGAs were announced, I seriously considered selling everything.  The golden age of video cards meant "no pre-order", and "no relying on shady companies for money-printing machines".  Your average Joe could buy a few video cards and start mining.  Equal grounds, no one was relying on a company to provide them equipment.  
If there was a coin that was completely FPGA/ASIC proof, I'd switch to it in a heartbeat.  Almost did it with LTC.

If NY is testing the waters, they (state and federal gov) will want no anonymity with Bitcoin.  If there's non-compliance, they'll force business not to accept it.  They'll want to make sure taxes are reported.  They'll want to make sure you can't buy illegal products with it.  They'll want to make sure you can't fund terrorism with it.  In other words, they will want to know who's on the sending and receiving end of every transaction.

I'm actually being more reckless due to Bitcoin.  I'm considering buying several pounds of sauerkraut just because they accept Bitcoin.  
In my opinion, the only way to make Bitcoin work is to spend it.  Make a vendor happy they took that risk.  If liquidity stops/slows down, it's over.  Just an example, i went to a street fair in my home city today with a Blockchain app ready for spendin'.  Not one vendor out of about 50.  Kind of makes you think if it's worth holding.

The prohibition will come in the form of making it a crime for a US business to accept any payment other than USD.  That'll pretty much kill Bitcoin in this country.  They don't have to prohibit Bitcoin itself, they just need to make it a pain in the ass to use.  
If Bitcoin appears to be any threat to the dollar, they'll make something like "US Currency Protection Act" (and I'm calling it in 2016).  This new law, signed by President Hillary Clinton, protects the interests of the United States by prohibiting any registered business from accepting payment for goods or services other than the US dollar.

I'll postulate that they don't do it "all the time".  Yes, there are very, very many stupid cops that would do something like this.  Consider that your average cop has invested almost half a year in a police academy similar to a boot camp.  Then you start working for a pension, which you can collect more than what he stole, every month for the rest of his life after only 20 years of service.  Also consider that a cop would lose all of that and face mandatory jail time if this was proven true.  Also consider that almost everyone has a personal video and audio recording device on their person at all times.  I suggested to the OP a clear-cut plan if this indeed happened.  This is national news if it did.  I suspect nothing will happen.

For what he never knew
Now man's reign is through
But throught eternal night
The twinkling of starlight
So very far away
Maybe it's only yesterday...
In the year 2525
If Bitcoin is still alive
If the hashrate can survive
They may find
In the year 3535

"Police can seize cash that they find if they have probable cause to suspect that it is related to criminal activity. The seizure happens through a civil action known as asset forfeiture. Police do not need to charge a person with a crime. The burden of proof is then on the driver to show that the cash is not related to a crime by a legal standard known as preponderance of the evidence."
I'll assume this is what you're referring to, and that's not what happened according to the OP.  According to the OP, he was detained, asked about the contents of an envelope, and had that envelope seized without any type of notice or police contact info.  
I'm not saying that asset forfeitures and civil cases don't completely screw innocent people, I'm saying that there's no way the cop could legally do what he did the way it was presented by the OP.  That were me, I'd make calls to ACLU, NAN instead of posting a story on reddit.  
Also cash is not Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is more like jewelry, PMs, rare baseball cards, etc.

"US cops are legally entitled to take any cash they find in car stops under the assumption that all cash is drug cash"
Ok, find me one Federal, State, or local statute that points to what you're talking about.  It's nonsense.  Cops are not legally entitled to seize property without cause, and especially just take it from the owner without giving a summons or a property receipt.  The only exception would be alcohol from a minor, or things like fireworks where prohibited.

I gave you the benefit of the doubt and realized I was right all along.  Obvious that the OP lost some money and wanted to justify to the world that he really isn't a bad investor, it's just that people/companies just don't like Bitcoin as much as he thought (paraphrasing).  I said he didn't get it.  I said it when people complained at the 30$ drop, the 200$ drop, etc, etc.  If you're looking for a quick buck at the expense of people that see Bitcoin as an innovation, I'm glad they got burned.

Ok - what does Dark Wallet provide that's sell-able.  What will make an impact other than non-sensical stock clips.   Dark Wallet provides security and privacy.  
Fade in on a customer at a bank-tellers window.  Guy pulls out a white wallet and pulls out some fiat to hand to the teller.  Instantly, three other people in suits appear behind him, writing something on clipboards.
Fade in on a woman with a white purse, behind police lines.  Maybe it looks like a foreign country. She reaches into her purse and attempts to hand a protestor fiat.  A jack-boot intercepts the transaction and throws the fiat to the ground while pushing the protestor along.
Fade in on a man reaching into a white wallet to hand a homeless person some fiat.  A person,maybe a politician, grabs the money, puts it into his pocket and walks away - wagging a finger.  
Fade in on all those people standing over a pit or a cliff, throwing all those white wallets into the abyss.  Then maybe pan around a group of hundreds of people standing around the same hole and throwing their white wallets in.  
Maybe some dramatic music and have them pull out dark wallets.  All the above transactions go through.  Except replace the fiat with something.  Maybe the Dark Wallet symbol.  
Then at least throw up a website.  Anything, for the love of Pete that sends me to where I can get one.

Completely plausible.  300 coins could easily be had with a series of FPGAs or a bunch of video cards in a relatively short amount of time in 2012.  If you had the foresight to throw down some cash and buy them outright, 300 BTC would be around what, 1 or 2 thousand dollars?  About right amount for a mortgage payment OP claims to have made for the BTC.

Your scenario is only if Bitcoin goes to zero. The bet is whether Bitcoin will outpace gold within 5 years.  If gold is 5000/oz and BTC is 4000, Schiff wins.  If the ratio stays the same as it is now, Schiff wins.  It wasn't a bet that Bitcoin would be zero within five years.  
It may not be in Schiffs favor, but it certainly not a stupid bet.

And joyously screams out it's pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or whirring that fall gently like rain

The people will all see it's light
Let them all make their own alt-coins
The Priests praise my name on this night

I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an recent miracle
I thought that you should know
Listen to my fan blades whirring
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you
Yes, we know, it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ASICs now
The world is doing fine
Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan
I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this currency
Just think what we might do
Listen to my fans whirring 
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you
Don't annoy us further!
We have our work to do
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?
Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the Plan!
[V. Oracle: The Dream]
I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light?
I stand atop my basement stair
An angry wife confronts me there
She leads me on saying "Its too loud!"
Through Wheel of Fortune, Big Brother
I see the works of gifted hands
That that used to make dinner, mow the lands
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes
They forced us out not too long ago
The nagging race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home to tear the Temples down...
Home to change!
[VI. Soliloquy]
The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams...
Just think of what my life might be
In a world without mining like I have seen!
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood...
... Spills over...

Do you know what attaches carcinogens to food?  Charcoal grilling - ban that.  Farts contain particulates of human waste and methane, ban it.  Wait, you can't ban a body function, lets tax it.  Every fart a nickel.  Put the money into global warming research caused by farts.  It's going to take a lot of people saying "enough" in order to get attention.  Trust me, the same people are looking at Bitcoin the same way.  Enough.

I remember these thoughts during the stock market crash of 1999/2000.  I had about 225k tied up in some penny stocks, .coms, and other high risk stocks.  I thought I was a genius and was planning on cashing out at 300k and buying a house and paying off my debts.  Well, the crash happened and my holdings were worth about 8% of original value.  Back to square one, with even more debt because I started doing margin calls towards the end.  
There's lessons to be learned from every bad experience - relationships, careers, finances, religion, you name it.  There's also ALWAYS another opportunity that presents itself.  I was fortunate enough to get into BTC in 2011, and cashed out slowly over the years to cover my original investments.  Your opportunity may not be in crypto-currency, or who knows?  Maybe an alt-coin will take over Bitcoin in five or ten years?  Maybe your opportunity is an invention, or joining the Peace Corps, or starting your own business.   The only thing of certainty is that if you "punch-out" there are never any more opportunities, just an abrupt and untimely end.  If I had punched out during the stock market crash, I never would have had a family, a house, a decent job, and a pretty decent financial recovery due to Bitcoin.  
It sucks losing like this.  It really does.  Start over.  This, like all things, is temporary.

You're wrong.  In order for a seizure, especially with anything of value, must be issued with a receipt to the owner.  Anything else is theft on the part of the cop.  If I'm stopped with a suitcase full of cash, sure I can be detained and questioned, but I guarantee that anyone (innocent) would be on a phone to an attorney within seconds.  
The person also has to be charged with a crime for the seizure. Police can't go, "Hey this looks funny, it's mine.  See ya.".  Replace Bitcoin with any other object of value - Faberge Eggs, original Picassos, heck even cold cash.  Cops can't just arbitrarily say "looks like drug proceeds, I'll just take it back to the station" without issuing some kind of summons or property receipt.

A group of treasury agents brought me into a back room and put my thumb in a similar machine.  They said "You think squishing pennies is some kind of joke?  Do you know how much work is put into those things?  Vets.  People that fought for this country hand carve them and you treat them like scrap."  Then they turned the machine on.  It didn't do anything, it was just used to scare the living crap out of currency defacers.

I enjoy the optimism, but there's no way Bitcoin will completely replace traditional payment methods in any of those things mentioned.  1-2%, maybe.  I think even 5% is wishful thinking.  At his projected estimate of $40,000/BTC, 1 or 2% would be $400/$800, which is a much more realistic result.

If the rentor decided to make meth or screw nine year olds, the police will investigate the goings-on of the whole house.  Right now there's no safeguard to tell police during a search warrant "wait, I let people access my wifi anonymously for money".  They (the police) will still confiscate and examine your computers, and bring you in for questioning.

I went to Target today for some shopping.  They are giving all customers 10% regardless of how you pay (because of the loss of customer data). Stack it with a gyft card and you can get 13% anything in the store.

.1 BTC for the first six special waffle customers - let them know some random guy in New Jersey transferred a Bitcoin breakfast with no transaction fees and thru the magic Internet currency of Bitcoin!  Good luck with your waffle wagon - it sounds delicious!

Gyft, in my opinion, is one of the best things about commercial Bitcoin use.  Want to impress someone or a group of friends?  Go to a restaurant, wait for the bill, and go "I got this".  Then proceed to show them how easy and quick it is to get a gyft card and pay.  Customer service is top-notch (thanks Vinny), and with this promo?  I know some people that will be getting some gyft cards this year!

It's actually easier using gyft than a normal credit/debit card.  I was in Target yesterday and had my gyft card queued up.  She announced the total, I held up my phone, and she scanned the bar code.  Even she was amazed and said "wow, that's cool!"

Just an opinion:  take maybe one or two out and spend on BTC merchants.  Buy some Bees Bros. items,  George's Famous Baklava, or a t-shirt.  Stop by a BTC business and have a cup of coffee or a beer.  Bitcoin was meant to be spent, not just sat on.  I believe that in order for this grand experiment to work, merchants have to see Bitcoin as a valid, and profitable payment method.  Without that, we can just sit on BTC charts all day and trade amongst ourselves.
