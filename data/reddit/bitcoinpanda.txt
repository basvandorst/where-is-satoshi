Nobody is hodling ... everyone are just panic dumping.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:46:29
Let's all go there and report this account! This is disgusting.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:29:33
Really surprising coming from him. Too bad that usually stupid people are the loudest  -&gt; Roger V.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:55:58
I agree! If there is a bad press now or someone loses funds because of this I have a feeling that Roger and Bcash crew would immediately use it against Bitcoin to spread FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:04:19
I think so too, it shouldn’t dip further than 9500ish.
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:55:33
On the other hand check out Bcash repo ( There is nothing, literally nothing. No commits, no dev. Where are all those dev teams that Roger was mentioning? It makes me sick to see what those frauds are doing to Bitcoin.

You need to get your private key from BitGrail, but I suppose your address is just generated for deposits from a central wallet, which means that you are basically f**ed.

It's obviously a joke. Chill your tits.
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:55:36
The same way as it went out? I don't understand what you are asking.
Let's be real here, anything except BTC, LTC and maybe ETH is pure shit and speculation, just a way of gambling/making money. Why do you think double digit drops happen on shitcoins? Because nobody truly belies in the project and dumps on the first sight of trouble.
Give it some time, sooner or later everything is going to come back to BTC.

Noooo f***ing waaay! This is why I love crypo. Best show on Earth since 2012!

What? Which repo is the real one then? Can't they just call it Bcash or something? Why create a branch in BU? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:12:08
No, that’s only what all the people that spread fud what you to think. This entire dip is lasting so long just becaouse of people like you. A selffullfiling prophecy.

If everyone moved to Segwit and LN was here the fees would be much lower.
Besides, fees are ok because fee market has to develop for when mining no longer produces big block rewards. Fees are going to be the only source of income for miners.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:07:14
ok, let's see! I could really use some cash now. I wouldn't mind 5-10 BTC :)

Sold WoW gold for BTC on 4chan :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:11:22
I don't care, I'm holding for years now. I'm just trying to explain why we have this dip and how low it would go. I'm not selling, I have been buying actually everytime we touch 9k.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:33
My only question is .. if everything is so smart and holding and buying (I did), why is the price going down? Obviously someone is unloading like a motherfu***er.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:18:13
Other than few Rogers pumps, and people dumping their free coins there is nothing interesting about Bcash. It's not like someone is using it for anything other than price speculation/trading. Just 1 more shitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-23 18:24:05
Good job! I wish more people would fallow your actions. Guys, now when fees are low it's a good opportunity to move your coins to Segwit addresses/wallets.
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:07:05
I liked what he was saying before when he was promoting bitcoin, but now his meetups just turned into his bullshit trading strategy pitch.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:45:58
Short answer, just don't. it's not profitable for a single person or startup. Better buy BTC and HODL.

No, not possible. You have to fund a channel, after you have a channel open to a node which connects to other nodes you are free to do whatever you want.
I would submit a low fee TX for opening a channel and wait few days, after it's established you are ok for some time until you spend all your funds in a channel.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:13:26
Hahaha same here. Been avoiding me coleague with whom I take luch for weeks now. He bought in at 18k
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:21:31
Wow, you guys are really late to the show. But don't worry I bought at 18k, as well as ~300. There's no bad time to buy.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:50:09
And if we hit 7.4k you will say 6.2k. The old classics are comming back.
@_date: 2019-07-16 06:06:01

also ..
Bcash! Bcash! Bcash!
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:35:08
Shorting BTC at this price would be insane and stupid. I do believe in BTC, but reason why it's bad to short it now is because it's really low market cap and has huge price swings. If you ever shorted something you would know that such high price swigs can get you REKT quite fast. What I would do is pump the price a lot higher to above 100k and stabilise it. Once you have a stable "high price" then you can short it. Just image if they go short, and people start buying the dip like crazy. I personally hold a lot of cash and would good in BERSERK mode on any price below 7k.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:54:39
Yes, I personally don't trade at all. Just sit and watch. The only problem that I have is that if I want to invest a bit more, any amount of (in dollars) that I buy is nothing compared to what I already have so the increase in gains on new investments is less than minor.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:53:23
I agree 100%, I'm sure he's not invested in Bcash. He's using Bcash just for pump &amp; dump. He probably used a really small amount of his btc to buy in at 300 and now he's enjoying other peoples money after he pulled a really nice scam.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:03:49
It's not Core, it's just Bitcoin.

Funny things is, we didn't have an ETF in Dec of 2017 and people were buying BTC at 19k, now we still don't have an ETF and people sell on 6k.
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:17:55
And what if ETF is delayed/declined? All the noobs are going to dump it down to 5400 (at least).
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:25:33
Dump to 6100, and then pump to 6500 ... yippee ki yay mo\*\*\*cker!

The news has been out for 30 min already and no big dumps? Could it be that we have reached nirvana?
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:38:59
This makes no sense ... imagine we dipped to 6k like we did in Jan and rebounded to 12k and stayed on this level for the rest od 2018 and then a nice growth again back to 20k, 30k and so on. Then all the people who sold, would cry. It's easy to say what was the right thing to do after it's already done. But good advice would be, to take some profit once in a while. For me personally in Germany we get tax free returns if we hold for more than 1 year and that's one of the reasons why I didn't sell.
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:11:34
Iron hands! 
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:20:28
From investment point of view, taking this big risk for only 44% doesn’t make sense to me.

Sooner than you think!
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:21:09
I also look at it this way. The pain of not investing and missing a bull run or insane profits, would be bigger than losing money when it's going down.

@_date: 2018-05-23 19:01:59
Yeah, why not? I believe that this tech has future and I'm betting on it. Don't get scared by the amount, this is just a matter of perspective. For me investing 2M would be a lot, still, some people do it with ease. It's all matter of perspective.
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:48:44

@_date: 2018-05-08 18:32:36
Check this out! How come that all the Bcash hardforks are so easy to do (overnight even) and super "accepted" by miners? I'll answer. Because all the pools that mine Bcash are owned by a single guy. Ok, so now you have a super centralised coin and you can easly pump hardforks and "upgrades". Tell me why wouldn't Ver or anyone else just create an upgrade and raise the cap to 40 MIL Bcash? Or hardfork and add funds to single address? Or do a easy chain reorg with 51% attack (they control 90% anyways). Jesus Christ, it makes me sick just thinking of what kind of shit you can pull on that coin and I don't know who in their right mind would put their money with Bcash. Segwit upgrade was hard, it was an insanely long soft-fork. You think that was a problem? Making Bitcoin hard to change .. is a feature, not a bug :)
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:34:37
Because we don't need scaling yet. If there was a huge urgency and a problem with block sizes, people would be using segwit. Mempool is almost empty, blocks half full. I hope you didn't fall for Bcash meme.
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:36:33

Exactly! This is because the market is full of young and unexperienced investors which panic on every single thing. There is no reason for this dump, absolutely no reason. Even if you were speculating on the decision, you just have to wait 30 days longer.
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:17:23
There is a plot twist, people earn the same here in Munich, Germany. An average apartment (70sqm) would cost around 800k. Basically your entire 44 years of savings. This means you will take 0 vacations, 0 expenses, no kids, not even saying to pay back the interest that you took for the loan in the first place. Just think about it. I really don't know how some people survive and why do they participate in this game.
@_date: 2018-05-16 07:20:25
It's really annoying how we have sooo much good news and it doesn't move the price up one bit. Last year, any single news item like today would already move the price up for at least 500$. It's true what they say, in bull run any bit of news is great, but in a bear market there is no good news.
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:45:45
You are basically writing how YOU think people trade (buy high, sell low or selling for minor gain). Not everyone fallow the same pattern and yes 80% of them have small to no gains SHORT-TERM. Basically, investing at almost any point in time before Dec 2017 would put you in profit zone now. That being said, I'm a long time hodler and have definitely 1000+% gains.
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:43:04

It's obviously not by "most", but by only 30%. I think it will take a bit more to transfer it to 100% segwit. People are still afraid to switch, plus it segwit has to be the default option in wallets.

That's almost impossible.  I would do some math before pulling a number like that out of my ass on live tv.
With the current price it would mean that bitcoin would rise \(starting from today\) 7133$ USD per month for 6 months without correction! Or 1783$ USD PER week for a half a year!

Nobody cares and nobody needs it. All it was used for was to orchestrate another pump in price. The price will also correct itself soon after hype fades away.

Just a bit of history, Roger Ver was one of cofounders of [blockchain.info]( They also added Bcash before adding segwit although it was already active at that point.

What? Why would event someone call it an altcoin. It’s a 2nd layer on btc. Lightning uses the asset on which it’s run. Like btc or ltc.
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:24:36
lol ... i know some will downvote this but the truth is that women (in general, there are exceptions) are not interested in technology or investing and even more in combination of both like bitcoin. They will be the last last adopters, and only because at that point they will use btc to buy the latest crap in the stores.

It's just to create news, hype and publicity. Let's face it, 60% of crypto investors have little to no technical knowledge and most of the price spikes around shitcoins are generated by hype and "news". None of the coins are used anywhere and all is just speculation and hype. And this is why 32mb upgrade is used as well, to prop up the price. To have another piece of news on which they can build the next pump. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Don't get me wrong, you can make money on this for sure. But the real question here is: "Would you rather hold BCH or BTC for the next 10 years?". This is how I invest.

ok, but who cares? Why would wash trading matter? It has no effect on price at all. Wash trading by definition is to not have effect, the trades cancel each other out. The only "bad" thing is that some exchanges are perceived to have higher volume than they do to attract traders.

If person doesn't have LN and doesn't want to use it, it's their choice. They can use normal on\-chain transactions or open a channel which can be also used in future for other payments.

Stores can also accept 0\-conf, making the payment instant, but they have to take the risk of double spend. What I have read so far is that 0\-conf is good enough and people don't cheat so the risk is ok. When you buy online who cares if it's 10, 20, or 30 min, they can wait.

Every single person who doesn't understand bitcoin or blockchain will laugh at you (my experience so far).

I completely agree, especially in a case where fundamentals of your investment has changed. For example company in which you invested being acquired by some other company which you don't like. Changes in sale strategies, products etc. The same goes for crypto. If we are talking Bitcoin here, fundamentals didn't change and technology is just getting better and better and with time price will reflect that. There is also an option on reducing your position to a comfortable level, not just cashing out because you will feel regret when the price picks back up, so staying at least with one foot in the game is always good.

No, I don't. Bitcoin is a currency, but it's hard to use it at the moment like that. When it's going to be mature enough it will be used a currency. It's just not ready yet. We need a lot more money pumped in, more hodlers, more users, more adaptation of lightning. More everything.

@_date: 2019-10-26 10:38:25
At the point when bitcoin becomes "STABLE" it won't make you any gains anymore. Isn't point of the game to invest early and cash on the risk? If you want 2% return and stability go to gold. Bitcoin is emerging technology with a lot of risk, but with a lot of gains as well. High risk = high gains/high losses .. people don't see that?

Bitcoin is not a bubble. It has cycles of pumps and dumps like any emerging technology.  IMO bubble would be going from a 100$ valuation to 20000$ and back down to 100$ and never recovering. Bitcoin made a higher low every year in the past 10 years.

They are all part of the hype cycles. When BTC goes down they will lough at you and tell you "I told you so", and when it goes back up then they will spread rumors that you are a multimilionare because you hold bitcoin. I was telling people about BTC when it was sub 800. Nobody bought. They will all fomo later at a much higher price when "it's safe to invest".
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:02:21
I like these insane gains, but why can’t bitcoin just play nice once! I would be happy with 10% a month. With such crazy pumps it just makes me think it will brutally dump because a lot of people made a lot of profit and are cashing out.

But the thing is they try (and succeed) to convience a bunch of people following them into stupid ideas and predictions. And of course, Tone is always right no matter where the market is heading. Guys, there is just one universal truth! Nobody knows where the markets are going to go! Nobody. P.s. tone sold a big part of his position on 5K ��

Ok, here it goes. I think I never told this anyone, but here is how i do donations. I wanted to make sure that the money which I donate ends up with the people who need it. Basically, I like running as a sport. And I usually in winter, like it's now, cash out about 1000 EUR in 100EUR bills and I go on a "run" through the city (Munich, Germany). On my runs I would find homlesses people or people who need it and I would just hide a 100 EUR bill in their coat or jacket. I do this at least once a month in winter. If you like the idea, please upwote it and I'll gladly redistribute your BTC (in cash) to people who need it.
p.s. I'm quite ok on financial side and have a really high paying job and a nice amount of BTC as well so I do not need 1 more. But if you want to do something good I'll be your runner. 
PM me for details.
Merry X-mas!

Highly unlikely that there is a bug in bitcoin. That being said, there are developers working on bitcoin protocol for free for years now and you think you would be able to receive some sort of reward? It would be nice if people would for once do something just because it's the right thing to do. Bitcoin is bigger than our individual selfish reasons, and I think it might finally be a first step to having all people of Earth act as one and having one single currency and stand together at least there. Guys, don't be selfish.
tl;dr; There is no bug.
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:44:31
This is not how mining works. If the "profitability" drops, miners will shutdown, yes. BUT with miners shutting down, so will the difficulty rate drop and it would increase the the profitability back up because it's easier to mine again. Price and stock to flow are in perfect balance, same as profitability and mining costs. IMO, nothing will happen at first after halving and then the effect of lower new supply will kick in and propel the price higher. All the pumps before the halving are just speculation. The real effect is going to happen after.

@_date: 2019-04-22 11:50:51
You have few different questions here. But, if miners left, once they would start leaving the hashrate to mine new coins would start coming down and if every single "miner" left, if by miner you mean bigger mining pools, we would be back to mining with our cpu-s or gpu-s. The network would never die. As long as bitcoin has the price over 0$ there would be incentives to mine depending on the hashrate.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:57:59
I want to belive this but the reality is that bitcoin is not mature or stable enough yet to handle this. I think it’s perfect store of value but the past year showed us how volatile it is and not many people can cope with that. I think byc has to go to 8-10T marker cap to stabilize the price a bit and then people would use it as replacement to gold.

Like the HODL guy said, I'm not a trader and I know that I suck at trading so I won't even try to set stop losses.

And the biggest upside on hodling is the tax benefit, if you make a trade you are already liable for tax (depending on the country).
tl:dr; HODL on boys!

What he said. If you think you can apply TA on Bitcoin, you are going to get brutally REKT. The only way you can make profit is if you got lucky. Bitcoin is a "network asset", there is no such asset class in the word. The value of the network increases with the number of participants. There is no dividend, no boards, managers, profit. Also Captain here is talking like a real TA pro, there is a chance it will brutally dump OR go up next week. WOW

The worst thing is that Germans still use cash in stores, they don't use cards. It's easier to track on what you spend (you see stores name in your bank account), it's clearer (money is dirty), easier to transfer (I don't need a huge wallet to carry all my coins) and they still pay with CASH!!!

I don't think that "they" would collect $10 Billion to attack bitcoin just to destroy it. First of all, the "destruction" wouldn't be permanent, it would recover back up, unless you keep the 51% attack sustained for a long long time and it will be really expensive. I think "they" have a lot better ways of making money on the sheep without going through with an attack like this. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:34:21
Exactly, this time he go a bit further with listing his shitcoin on the exchanges. But the same as on this BU graph, node count applies to Bcash. It's all owned by him, not even mentioning the 40% Anonymous mining pool. But people are stupid and don't read. If we had a single mining pool with over 30% hash rate on Bitcoin, everyone would already be freaking out.

He's using the name "Bitcoin Core", so he can divide the brand "Bitcoin" into Cash and Core, as 2 equal parts of Bitcoin. He's a really skilled scam artists. Bcash will never be anything close to Bitcoin and it should not be even remotely mentioned in the same context. It's an airdrop altcoin like all the rest of the shitcoins.

@_date: 2018-03-20 06:52:51
It's hard. You just have to believe in fundamentals and in technology. There is one thing that helps though, once you buy high and sell low (crack under pressure) you will learn that feeling of failure and you will never again sell for a loss. People learn really hard from other peoples mistakes, but once you do it yourself (sell under pressure) and btc jumps back up, you will learn no to do it ever again.

It's not correct. Americans, once again, think that they are the world. If the cost of 1 BTC for an US based miner is 8000$, it doesn't mean that someone in Germany can't mine it cheaper (let's say 5000$), or India (300$).

There are 2 flaws in this article on LN. It says "It sounds good but there are some big problems with the lightning network. " and then it lists 2 issues.
1) If you are going to open a channel just to do 1 transaction, why not just send a transaction right away? Channel is not needed in this case. Argument is invalid.
2) You don't need to open a 30$ channel with your favorite cafe shop, you just open a channel with anyone who has a channel with cafe you shop and then you can use the channel to buy cafe and whatever else you like from other shops. This also makes the argument from article invalid.

And have nothing against a certain race, but you try walking to a club that has 50 black guys in groups waiting outside.

In Europe there are plently of banks. As soon as one does that you show them the finger and take your money to another bank.

We were at 6K for months, if you bought then you would have averaged it out. I think the only people that are still in red are those who bought at the absolute peak and never bought anything after it dumped. This is why you dollar cost average. If you bought at 20K and again at 6K and 3K, your would probably already broken even (depending on the amounts).

And if you go all in now and we correct 50% to 4500? You just lost half of your investment. But if you invest a portion now and we correct and you buy more you eill have more btc when we reach 50k. You still need to learn.

I would take nr. of active addresses as a valid performance indicator. Price can (as we see) move up and down drastically with an immature asset.

Yes. You never go 100% in with the full amount, you always have to average it. Unless you buy for some small amount just to play.
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:09:47
If it droped to 3000$ right now, you still would not buy. It’s how fear works.

LOL another TA Expert here. BTC has been oversold on all indicators since 5K and it should have corrected by now. TA sucks and all the people that think they can predict the price suck as well.

He will eventually spend all his money on bribing people and it will not work and he will stay poor, just like before he invested in Bitcoin. There are some people that you just cannot bribe Roger!

Tone Vays is like if you had a moron brother. Yrah, he’s on your team, but he’s useless. I’m glad that Tone is spreading the bitcoin word, but he’s not the smartest guy and also he doesn’t understand bitoin properly. On top of that he’s trying to push his TA crap. On the other side you have Andreas A., this is how a well educated speaker/representative should be.

What he said. If you receive crypto as payment for something and pay with it for something else you are ok. As soon as it's on exchange or bank account, you are done.
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:41:24
Too many people are focused on the price still.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:19:02
This in theory works, until it doesn't work. What if there is another company that buys on exchanges to pump the market value and cash on futures. It's not a game without big risk. The only thing that I see is that fear is more effective for controlling the masses. Which means it's easier to crash the market than to pump it up.

@_date: 2019-05-15 06:01:58
Probably not. Just because I think we are still early in the nitcoin game and there is a big upside still left to pump to over 200k. There is no point in liquidating your investment if the goal is not reached. Besides, my purchases on ebay are small. Spending and raplacing also doesn’t make selnse tax wise.
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:13:44
It was to be expected. The incompetence and delays from big organisations and goverments should be already known to everyone. If you were speculation on btc price just because of bakkt you are going to have a bad time.
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:05:15
100% agree. It’s clear all along that it was ment to be personal shitcoin. Funny thing about the internet is that it records all the things you said in the past. If you just look at posts from Ver and Jihan from last yer you will see it was all bullshit. Too bad that an average joe the shitcoin trader doesn’t care about this and they will try to gamble on anything.

And people were calling for a sharp capitulation. IMO, that would never happen, for that investors would have to "lose all hope", and bitcoin investors (hodlers) are different, we (including myself) would never sell, at any price. I'm long term insanely bullish on the technology and would never sell or "lose all hope". yes, some people will panic sell, but the technology is so incredible that people will be positive and excited at any price level, because they don't care about the price. It's about having your coins (value) and saying fuck you to any person that wants to claim them. With bitcoin, you are the king, the master of (financial) universe.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:34:59
These kind of posts are complete trash. Unless you backup your "prediction" with a matching 10-20x short or long position it's really cheap to talk shit.
The one and only truth is that nobody knows. Not bloomberg, not traders at nyse, not even Satoshi himself.
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:31:39
Depends on the country. I basically dumped bch right after the fork at around 800$. I felt it was the right thing to do to because I really dislike Ver and Jihan’s view on this. After that bch was pumped to 4k$ and I still felt i did the right thing. 1 year forward and here we are, bch at around 100$. It’s just a matter of time when it goes to 0. I would even try to short it but I’m not a trader and don’t want to get burned by wild pump and dumps but it’s clear where this is headed.
To answer your quedtion just transfer it from bch to btc directly wothout fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:52:16
1) Less btc in hands of those scammers is always a good thing 2) This can be only short term, which does not bother me at all

What happend to me yesterday is that I double spent my bank account :) I was doing some organising and wanted to bring one of the accounts to balance of 0€ so i sent all the money out but since it was friday (banks don’t work over weekend) i didnt see the transaction as pending and sent the same amount one more time. On monday I saw 2 pending transaction, 1st one to bring my account to 0 and the second overdrafting it to -60k € althoug overdraft isn’t possible on the account it was registered because the first transaction didn’t go through yet. On Tuesday they were still pending and I was charged interests on the entire sum that I don’t even have in my account yet. Day after I manages to revert the transaction with my banker. Fuck you Deutsche bank.
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:57:25
Too many tax implications for the employer to do this. Furthermore, we all want adoption, but it's too early to accept your salary in the form of bitcoin. Bitcoin is still too volatile. If this was really to be considered by "my employer" I would accept the salary but with a x% premium to compensate for the risk. Which is again tricky because you can always just sell the btc.
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:59:40
Oh man. I’m in Germany and we have SEPA, it sucks balls in any way except that it’s free from fees. I also worked in a bank with implementing those systems. Trust me, you don’t even want to know what kind of shit happens behind the courtains of our banking systems. For me it’s not a choise, but a neccesity to switch to bitcoin.

Exactly! I had a transfer from Friday and it's still not in my bank account! Before bitcoin I was somehow ok with that and took it as "normal". Now, it just pisses me off that we are stuck with an ancient wealth transfer system like banks! One you try bitcoin it's not possible to go back.
