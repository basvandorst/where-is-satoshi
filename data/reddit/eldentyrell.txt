Only if those rules can be expressed in the bitcoin scripting language.  No loops, no subroutines, no floating point, no get-datetime (nLockTime isn't a script opcode), multiplication and division disabled….
These are some pretty outrageous limitations.  You can't even write *bitcoin's own block difficulty specification* in bitcoinscript!  How are people supposed to use sidechains to extend bitcoin with new features when this sidechain mechanism can't even reimplement vanilla bitcoin?
Sorry to be harsh here, it just bugs me that you guys are not being up-front about these problems.  I still think this is a great idea I just think there's a sort of dishonesty in the way this it's being presented as a cure-all.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:34:37
This is a really cool idea, but I think people are being a bit dishonest in representing what it can do.
For example, if this sidechain mechanism is supposed to let people make sidechains that improve on bitcoin in some way, then at the very least you ought to be able to reimplement vanilla bitcoin (no new features) as a sidechain, right?  Unfortunately you can't:
  
Also there's a serious problem in that the sidechain mechanism fundamentally puts more trust in miners (collectively, of course) than bitcoin does.  In bitcoin a 51% attack allows double spends but not coin theft.  On a sidechain a 51% attack lets the miners steal coins.  This is a very serious and major change.  On top of it all, the sidechains don't bootstrap the miner incentive the same way bitcoin did, so there's no reason to belive that a stable incentive structure will emerge:
**I don't meant to rain on the parade.**  This is a neat innovation, but bitcoin-academia has a serious problem with rushing out nifty ideas with snazzy names (colored coins anyone?) and then not following through on the hard work of proving that it actually hangs together.  Satoshi earned my admiration by doing both the theoretical work *and* the heavy lifting.  I'd like to hold the new generation of bitcoin-philosophers to the same standard… I know they're capable of it as long as we don't let them get lazy :)

~~Meh.  The gambling sites have a huge flow relative to the actual balances (AFAICT didn't SatoshiDice hold your coins only until the next block?).~~
~~Exchanges have order books, so there's a much higher ratio of balances to deposits/withdrawals.  Exchanges are the ones that need to do this.~~
EDIT: I did not realize that just-dice paid interest to depositors in order to finance their operations.  Yes, solvency proofs are really important for that sort of service.  It is way cool that they are basically the first to do this.  Big points.
Offering interest on deposits is essential to any exchange that tries to offer short selling in a sustainable way, so it is really good that there is a working example of this (albeit in the form of a casino).  Impressed.

Then the mainchain miners need to know the specification and initialization of every sidechain...
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:09:14


Then what stops somebody from forging a message that "parses" to say I get all teh coinz?
I think you meant something a lot more complicated than parsing.  Something that would end up with the bitcoin blockchain's validity criterion depending on the exact definition of "difficultywise-longest and valid" for every single altchain.
Also this altchain is entrusting miners to determine ownership rather than merely to determine transaction ordering.  That's a substantially weaker property than bitcoin has.
There needs to be a whitepaper.  Too many unanswered questions.
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:16:01


I don't doubt that.  Unfortunately my grand project to read every public post on the entire interwebs is woefully behind schedule.


I can't imagine exchanges ever using SPV.  More to the point: why would they?  To save a dozen gigs of diskspace?  SPV works because there are enough people who don't use it.
I still think you've got some explaining to do as a result of combining "increased reliance on miners' good behavior" with "no block-incentive bribe for good behavior by miners".  This does not sounds like a particularly stable incentive structure.
It may turn out that stable incentive structures arise only from paying sidechain miner block-rewards out of the aggregate suspended coins of the sidechain.  The hitch is that you can't trust the sidechain miners to allocate those rewards to themselves, or it degenerates right back into "underpaid sidechain miners flee with my coins".
I suspect that the main-chain miner rule changes may have to include a provision for asking the main-chain miners to check not only "difficultywise-longest" but also "sidechain blockreward-honest".  Without the option for a sidechain protocol to specify sidechain block incentives **enforced by mainchain miners** I don't think there is a stable incentive structure.
Bitcoin bootstrapped cleanly because early on the coins were worth nothing so nobody had much incentive to steal them.  The good-behavior-bribe grew with the value of the stuff you were bribing the miners to secure.  These sidechain proposals don't work that way -- they burst into existence with large amounts of value (suspended coins) on the sidechain, entrusted to the good behavior of people who are basically donating their computing power.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:49:31
And hope/pray those fees are enough to keep the altchain miners from running away with your mainchain coins.
I actually think this might be an excellent experiment to determine if the no-block-incentive-transaction-fee-only endstate is as broken as I think it is.  At least this way I'd know for sure within my own lifetime :)

That would be great and I would be strongly in support of it.  But the current devs are extremely hostile to expansions of the scripting system… in fact the whole business of "standardness" of transactions has been used to more or less roll back the scripting system's abilities.  If it weren't for Luke-Jr and Eligius we probably would have lost a lot of the scripting system for good.
From a more neutral perspective, there is a tension between extending the scripting language and enabling fairly catastrophic cpu/memory exhaustion attacks.  It's not at all clear that the script system can be extended enough to allow "replace[ing the] altcoins" without enabling crippling denial-of-service attacks.  In fact [Blum's Theorem]( implies that it's impossible in full generality.
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:31:24


Yes I know, that frustrates me too.
Follow the first link in my post and walk upthread to nullc's comments (nullc=gmaxwell, who was the one who extended Back's one-way sidechain to a two-way sidechain.  FWIW I think it's the two-way stuff that's oversold).
The upshot is that the mainchain miners need to be extended (the same way they were extended for P2SH) to understand the difficulty rules for the sidechains.  Obviously we can't hardcode the difficulty rules for yet-to-be-invented sidechains.  The nullc comment says he intended that these rules be encoded in a scriptSig, but that can't even handle bitcoin-as-a-sidechain-of-bitcoin.
Ultimately the difficulty rule verification mechanism has to involve some sort of scripting since we don't know what sidechains will be invented in the future yet the "minerfork" to add this functionality is a painful thing that can probably only be done once.  Even if you don't use the existing script system and add some new script system there's still the unavoidable tension between scriptability in block validation and cpu/memory exhaustion attacks.

No, absolutely not.  The "suspend" transaction has to be implemented as something that looks like "spendable by anybody".  The same way P2SH was added to bitcoin.  It's then up to mainchain miners to enforce the rules for un-suspending coins (just like they currently enforce the rules for P2SH so that pre-P2SH clients aren't tricked).

Might be useful for those of you with coins/fiat still trapped at gox… hedge yourself out a bit.
This is a true prediction market, not just a bet like other sites offer.  Every prediction has an order book, and you're buying+selling true futures contracts.  Since the cost and payoff are clearly defined it's possible to calculate the market-implied probability of the event, which is tremendously useful.
Granted, the contract terms aren't "mtgox insolvency", but after thinking for a while I think this makes more sense.  Stuff like customer withdrawals, etc, can get into gray areas.  But if they truly are insolvent and admit to it publicly they have to halt trading, so I think from the perspective of crafting a contract that can be refereed fairly this was a good choice.

I should probably save this for its own self-post, but I think the POW innovations have it all wrong.  You can't prevent ASICs; there is no ASIC-proof POW.  But that isn't the point.  The point should be to ensure that some near-ideal mining device (a) *already exists* in mass production, with another use, (b) isn't susceptible to botnet-mining, and (c) has an operation cost dominated by silicon rather than electricity.
I fear very much what happens once the difficulty plateaus and the only people who can still mine are those with $0.02/kwh electricity and most users are facing electricity costs **five times higher** than revenues.  Nobody "mines for fun" to any meaningful degree in that situation.  The hydroelectric warehouses buy up all the idled ASICs from high-electric-cost owners at bargain prices and we wind up with five or six giganto-mines.  Then the next time the BTC/USD exchange rate takes a sudden plunge -- for any reason -- those five operators can't cover their electric costs and the rational choice for them and their shareholders is to mount a 51% attack.
We're relying on altruism more than we think, folks.
If the POW is engineered so that the ideal mining device already exists people won't have to take a gamble with sketchy outfits like BFL.  If it has other uses they won't be tempted to sell when operation becomes unprofitable, or they'll sell on ebay to people applying it to a non-mining use.
Unfortunately the people cooking up idiotic monstrosities like scrypt-jane and X11 have absolutely no clue what they're doing.  Hey look I'll gang together ten ASIC-friendly algorithms and that just has to be ten times better, guys!
One possibility is a scrypt-like algorithm with anti-TMTO modifications (use serially-chained addressing for not just the read-phase but the write-phase too) and an utterly massive N-value, like 8GB or more, beyond the amount of memory in the average botnet-slave.  Then the ideal mining device looks like a very cheap ($3-4) backplane full of commodity DRAM DIMMs.  You'd still need to buy a cheapo backplane to mine, but those things are easy for any PCB shop to design.  Heck you could solder them up yourself.

I'm not sure that's such a great name for people trying to understand how this works...  especially because central banks "peg" currencies all the time without a full reserve, so according to the way "peg" is used right now it implies fractional reserving.
It's more of a "spend to anybody" transaction on the main blockchain that the miners will refuse to allow to be redeemed until the sidechain authorizes the redemption.
In theory this new requirement for miners can be rolled out the same way P2SH was, but I'm still skeptical about (a) the ability to nail down exactly what main-chain miners need to do and ensure it's still compatible with them behaving selfishly and (b) the unavoidably weaker security properties of any coins "deposited in" a sidechain that works this way.

Personally, I think the constant ranting about how "bitcoin isn't about mining" has officially been overdone.

Say you have 1000 coins.  User wants to withdraw 1.  If you make a two-output transaction with 999 coins coming back, **those 999 coins constitute unconfirmed outputs** until the next block is found (avg 5min).
Sure, you can issue transactions whose inputs aren't confirmed yet, but the longer those unconfirmed chains get the more things can go wrong.  Miners have funny and ill-documented rules about how they handle this stuff.  The P2P transaction-flooding protocol is not terribly reliable.  Transactions do get stuck; many bitcoin bugs have been discovered this way.  Splitting coins is all about minimizing (a) the length of the unconfirmed chain and (b) the amount of coins that get stuck in the event of a fee/miner/client bug.
If every bitcoin client in use by everybody was 100% bug free perhaps this wouldn't be necessary.  But that isn't the case.

I don't think these sorts of attacks can be argued against.  The basic incentive structure and cryptography that makes bitcoin work is not simple at all, and not something that 70% of the population is likely to take the time to understand.  Focus on convincing the 10-20% of the population who are willing to think carefully about this stuff, and then the rest will switch over simply because **everybody else is doing it**.
When you hear arguments like the ones above, just ignore them.  The people you have a chance of convincing are not swayed by them, and the people swayed by them will never be convinced by anything other than "everybody else is doing it".

There's a very strong community of software developers around the bitcoin client, for sure, but I don't think we ought to expect the bitcoin userbase/economy to be any more of a community than the group of people who self-identiy as as "gold bugs".  Nothing wrong with that, nor does it detract from the revolutionary nature of the technology.  In fact it's even sort of a sign of maturity; there is no "world wide web community" anymore; the WWW has been such a grand-slam success that people no longer identify with it -- they just use it and benefit greatly from the fact that it exists.  **I don't think we should be afraid of a future in which most people who benefit from bitcoin do not consider themselves to be "bitcoiners"**

Not much.  So little that I knew bitscalper was a fraud from day one.
I implemented all the exchanges' APIs mainly to get the best price on the coins I mined back when I had to pay off hardware bought with USD.  Having done that, adding simple arbitrage on top was easy, and the resulting spread-narrowing everywhere else helps to reduce MtGox's hegemony.  I'm almost always either the best bid or best ask -- and on rare occasions *both* -- on the smaller exchanges.
But the profits aren't enough to justify tedious/fragile stuff like screen-scraping.  In fact, at this point I do it mostly as a public service -- the profits just barely make up for the time I have to spend monitoring+maintaining the arb-bot and the fact that I'm exposed to counterparty risk (to varying degrees) with *every* exchange.  Managing that counterparty risk is another time-waster.
Anyways, this is the reason for my exasperation with the "bottom tier" poorly-run exchanges like BTC-E and [cryptoSexChange](  They're really screwing their customers with gigantic spreads by making life hard for people like me.

At the moment 99% of the bitcoin community is in denial about this, so at the moment all I propose to do is raise awareness.
Fortunately we have at least 8 years and probably more like 16-24 years before this actually becomes a problem.  I think even a very small block reward, perhaps as little as 1-2 BTC, will work well enough.  But I wish people would stop fooling themselves into thinking the block reward will ever cease to be the main incentive for mining.  The whole incentive structure and economics of transaction fees is half-baked, although it's probably the only half-baked part of what is an otherwise beautiful and elegant system.  I sometimes suspect that Satoshi really didn't expect transaction fees to work, but he wanted a deflationary currency so he put them in there simply as a plausible excuse to point to when people asked "what happens when the block reward runs out".  They sound workable if you don't think too hard.

By the way, I think there's an opening somewhere between:
* uclue (run by almost-professional-librarians) and
* answers.yahoo.com (populated mostly by teenagers)
Uclue is great if you have a question that can be answered by giving a link to a webpage.  The people who answer questions on that site are experts at researching things, but not often experts in any particular area of knowledge (say, burlap crafting or engine repair).
For example, I would be willing to spend time answering FPGA questions in exchange for small amounts of BTC.  But I'll only spend time carefully crafting an answer to a question for free if the question is particularly interesting.  I don't think there are any uclue researchers with the sort of specialized knowledge I have in that area.
So, **I think there's an opening for a site that lets you pay for answers from domain experts rather than reference/research experts.**  Some sort of subscription mechanism (RSS, etc) for the experts would be a must-have, since this only works if it's time-effective for people who only get one or two questions a month.

No, you can't.  This is a hardfork change.
Unfortunately unlike p2sh there is no way to make it a miners-only change… the trick behind p2sh was to make the new transaction type look like giving away free coins from the perspective of non-upgraded clients, so they wouldn't think these unintelligible transactions were invalid.

**TL;DR: we need blockchain difficulty futures.**
When you invest your money (which we assume you earned as fiat) in a mining operation, you're betting on three factors: the (1) the mining operations costs (fixed and variable), (2) BTC/fiat exchange rate, and (3) the future difficulty level.
When you invest in a mining company or technology, you're betting that they do (1) better than the alternatives.
You can hedge (2) by shorting BTC.  This isn't anti-bitcoin if you had to use fiat to buy your mining hardware; it's just rational.  If you bought your mining hardware using BTC from ztex, for example, you're already hedged on this axis.
The problem is that you can't hedge (3).  You don't know how many BTC one hash/sec will earn you four months from now.  So you're gambling on this.
If we had blockchain difficulty futures, we could separate the task of "pick the most efficient producer of hashpower" from "forecast the blockchain difficulty level" so that people could invest/wager on one and NOT on the other.
Right now it sucks, because if you have better-than-the-market knowledge of one of those you still have to basically flip a coin on the other one.  You can't invest in one and not the other.

Yeah, I guess the lesson from the whole NMC experiment is that **fungibility matters.**  With fungible coins like BTC, early-adopter "squatting" is really just speculation, which bootstraps the currency and makes it more valuable.  With non-fungible coin chains, squatting ends up making the chain less valuable.
FWIW I used to be a big namecoin proponent.  I'm a bit more ambivalent about it nowadays.
I think something like namecoin for IP addresses (or IPv6 addresses) could still work.  They're not meant to be read or remembered by humans, so they're fungible.  Namecoin-like technologies might be a replacement for ARIN/BGP in some post-apocalyptic infrastructureless world, but I think they've pretty much failed at replacing ICANN.

No, the problem is that when the block rewards go away there are **too few equilibriums**.  When block rewards cease to be the main source of mining income, there is an unavoidable "race to the bottom" that will drive transaction fees to 1 satoshi.  The only reason transaction fees are so high right now is that rejecting 1-satoshi transactions doesn't have a measurable impact on a miner's income.  When that changes, we'll have a rapid race to the bottom.

No, it is not a prediction market.  You do not know with certainty how much money you will get if you win the bet.  This is an absolutely crucial property **that intrade has,** and without it the market does not have any predictive power.
Here's an example: I'm going to flip a coin.  If it comes up heads you give me a dollar.  If it comes up tails I'll give you some undefined amount of money.  Want to take that bet?  Think peoples' answer to this question helps predict the probability of it coming up tails?

A lot of these dumb fronting bots can be exploited.  Somebody needs to write an app to do this.

The hard part of voting is making sure that votes correspond one-to-one with human beings.  Bitcoin doesn't help with that; we can't even tell which accounts are owned by the same human (perhaps by design).
Most of the problems that can be solved can be solved without the need for anything like a blockchain:
  
However, the blockchain may come in handy as a publicly-agreed-upon auditable source of randomness.  Most cryptographic voting protocols need this.  At the moment people use things like the number of shares traded on the NYSE on a particular day, modulo some prime number, as a seed.  The hash of some future block in the public blockchain would be a better source.

Thank you, this is the kind of info I was looking for.  20GH from 10,000 nodes means almost none of those nodes are GPU-mining.  **If a 10,000-node botnet turns out 20GH/s we have nothing to worry about.**  Control over 10,000 nodes is worth way, way, way more than the $1200/month it earns mining BTC, and if this is the prevailing ratio then even all the botnets put together are an insignificant portion of the network hashpower.
FWIW, the botnet concern is what killed hashcash (bitcoin's predecessor, cited by Satoshi in the original whitepaper).  Without GPU mining -- and later FPGA mining -- Bitcoin would have suffered the same death, becoming known as "botnetcoin".

Most FPGA dev boards have a TON of extra bells and whistles.  These have to be left off of mining boards in order to even hope to get a halfway reasonable $/Mhash/sec.  There is very little demand for these "bare bones" FPGA boards from people doing anything other than bitcoin mining.  In fact, before about a year ago, it was very very difficult to even find a "cheap" board with a large FPGA on it.  Any board with a chip big enough for profitable mining had at least another $500 worth of unrelated crap (DDR memory, PCI connectors, gigabit transceiver connectors) on it.

I'm pretty skeptical about botnet mining making more than a few pennies.  You'd have to have a pretty amazingly large botnet to get even a small number of compromised nodes with useful GPUs.  Remember, most of the machines that get hacked are office machines, not gaming rigs.
I'm not denying that it happens -- obviously the CPU-mining code in cgminer wound up on virus scanner blacklists for a reason.  But I think this is mostly leftovers from back when CPU mining was meaningful combined with "hey why not".
I would be very interested if any of these researchers actually gave a figure for the hashpower of the botnets they've found.

I don't think even BFL has.  It appears that they're waiting for the chips to come back from the fab.  If they're targeting a 22-Oct ship date they're probably basing that on getting their chips back in late September.  If everything works it won't take them more than a week or two to ship, but if the chip is a dud it will take months to fix it if that's even possible at all (usually isn't and even if it is the post-manufacturing fixes are too expensive to apply to more than a few engineering samples).

Dude, the average trader barely has time to evaluate the creditworthiness of the exchange.  Anything with more than one or *maybe* two or three counterparties simply won't be used.
Look, this is why exchanges are able to charge fees: they put a ton of effort into demonstrating their creditworthiness as a counterparty, they maintain adequate reserves, and they get paid for that.  **All of these people who think they can run a successful "exchange" without doing that are fooling themselves.**  An exchange provides a critical service: it acts as central counterparty and puts effort into demonstrating its creditworthiness in a public way.  If you don't put in that effort, you aren't providing the service people are willing to pay for.
By the way, with bitcoin there are really novel and interesting ways to demonstrate creditworthiness -- publicly auditable capital balances, for one, which can be cross-checked against the order book by any third party.

Nice idea, but it does not answer the  most-important question.
If you store the blockchain, the trust model is simple: trust whoever can give you the longest chain.  If you aren't storing the blockchain, you need to come up with a replacement answer for this question.
I couldn't find any mention of this in the discussion thread or the overview in the design document.

You never said that the servers were trusted.  If they are, then you need to specify how the "trustedness" of these servers is established (as well as the exact degree of "trustedness") -- currently that is a gaping hole in this scheme.

**This is a very, very dangerous misconception.**
*The whole reason for having a blockchain is to prevent double-spends.*  If you don't have a copy of the blockchain, then the server you're trusting to answer the question "are the coins that X sent me in this transaction already spent" can lie to you.  **They can "send" you coins and then take them back with impunity,** since they've already sent those coins to themselves in another transaction (which they made sure was "mined in" to the chain before releasing the second transaction).
Saying you'll "connect to a whole bunch of servers" does nothing to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.  It also obscures the problem -- how do you know that one person didn't just rent 100 super-cheap VPSes (worse: botnet) and set up Electrum servers on all of them?  This is cargo-cult security.

 are they blocking BTC withdrawals?  If so, that is very serious and I will close my account immediately.
Blocking fiat withdrawals is perhaps understandable.  This might be something that was forced on them by know-your-customer regulations in order to be able to deal with the banking system.  But as long as you have BTC withdrawals the most you'll have to pay is the bid-ask spread (times two) in order to withdraw your funds from some other exchange.

Soft fork is generally taken to mean that non-mining clients need not upgrade.  I guess if you throw non-upgrading clients under the bus yes it is technically still a soft fork.  But you can do lots of things as soft forks if you're willing to let non-upgrading clients get robbed.

This isn't going to have any effect on scamming until it becomes positively unusual for an investment fund to hold even a small number of securities that aren't represented on a blockchain.
I wish this effort the best success, but I doubt this will ever happen.  Real estate ownership, for one, will always be determined by the government (i.e. whoever commands the military occupying the immediate area), and I doubt governments will ever prefer a blockchain to a county recorder.

It's actually easier to design a chip than to "reverse engineer" **the ability to mass produce one cheaply** (note emphasis).
And that's assuming you have access to the same fab that was making the original chips, which puts you at huge risk of getting caught by fairly stupid automated checks.  I know these checks are definitely performed when large customers (usually standard-cell designers) ask for them; not sure if they're  performed as a matter-of-course.
Trying to port somebody else's design -- for which you have only the layout and not the schematics or SPICE deck -- from one foundry to another is about 10x as hard as just designing your own damn chip.

It is a good thing namecoin works this way and it is a good thing bitcoin does not work this way.
That's not a typo.
Bitcoin is supposed to be money, and being able to store money for long periods of time without attending to it is useful and desirable.  At the same time namecoins are intended to represent a scarce resource (namespace), and the *namespace as a whole* becomes more useful if chunks of it can't be lost due to mistakes or neglect.  When bitcoins get lost that value is essentially redistributed among all the other coins since bitcoins becomes ever-so-slightly-more scarce.  So there's no net loss.
I have to say I'm not sure it's automatic that all digital goods should obey a single set of rules.  I'm not even sure what that set of rules would be.

Regarding the value of cloudflare DDOS protection -- and I'd rather not make this a big huge subthread -- it is awesome for static content; no argument there.  However for a bitcoin exchange if you're only routing your static traffic to cloudflare the part of your site that matters -- the order-placing HTML and APIs -- is still exposed.
Now, static content can be cached by cloudflare, so even if an attacker throws more requests at you than you can handle, the cloudflare servers can still serve the cached content, and you're still alive.  But for dynamic content your servers are still the bottleneck.
Cloudflare's answer to this is to claim that they do intelligent filtering, somehow noticing that a DDOS is in progress and filtering out the "bad" traffic from the "good".  I'm sure they do this for their big, media-covered clients.  I'm sure MtGox gets this.  But this is labor-intensive stuff; a human has to be involved in reacting to the attack, setting up the filters, managing them, etc (if this stuff were automated there would have been at least a few high profile "false alarms" by now -- nothing's perfect -- so I find it hard to believe that this part of their service is automated).
I've yet to hear of a small site that isn't paying significant bucks to cloudflare getting this kind of labor-intensive attention.  If you aren't big enough that a failure of your site would turn into a black eye for cloudflare, the protection you have for your dynamic content might not really be there when you need it.  If you're paying under $200/month there is no Service Level Agreement (SLA), and unless you're paying $3,000/month [the SLA simply says they refund part of your fees](  At that level it simply does not make economic sense for them to have an engineer set up filters -- the engineer's time costs more than the fees they'd have to refund even in the worst case.
Just to reiterate, all the above does not apply to MtGox.  They are paying cloudflare big bucks, and they are a high-profile client.  For them it's worth it and I'm sure they're getting what they think they're getting.  This also doesn't apply to static content, but for bitcoin exchanges the static content is the least important part of the site.

Given the level of nonsense over there I don't start threads about anything that isn't dry and technical.  I think a lot of the incoherence comes from a lack of threading more than one level deep (like reddit and NNTP have) so you can focus on the subdiscussions that are moving in a useful direction.  In the crude linear format the collective psyche can only handle one "train of thought" per topic, which really dumbs down the interaction and makes it easy to derail discussions.  A few posts are all it takes to crap all over a topic; with threading people just focus on the non-crapped-on subtrees.


In two cases, yes.  Both of them took a position that basically amounted to a combination of: (a) "security! security! security! anybody who doesn't use cloudflare is insecure!!!" and (b) "it's okay for us to use cloudflare as long as all those other exchanges don't, so it's their problem not ours".

The one-massive-floodfilled-feed wasn't what made usenet awesome, and in fact it's pretty much what killed it.
What made usenet awesome was the fact that it was a *protocol* (NNTP) not a heap of javascript and html, so people could use the client that they liked best.  This led to a lot of innovaiton and competition, which is why usenet clients are still, today, light years beyond any forum  software (yeah, this is a pretty depressing fact).  If you don't believe me just look at IRC… imagine if you had to use the BTC-E trollbox javascript to connect to freenet.  IRC clients have so many awesome features because IRC is a protocol and the IRC servers don't try to shove a UI down your throat.
Unfortunately forum admins derive a lot of their power from control over the UI (silly badges, ability to delete, etc) so there's sort of a conflict of interest… privately-run forums with admins who like being admins have a strong incentive to not offer this.

In addition this raises the whole other question of whether or not the aggregate set of stops would be public like the order book.

Imagine if computer manufacturers sold computers that randomly demanded to be returned to the factory for service if you sent too many emails through them...

We need a decent array of escrow providers.

Obviously somebody has never heard of [counterparty risk]( before.

Yeah, although having the case of the letter (uppercase vs lowercase) be significant isn't exactly a happy thing.  Too late to change it though...

That's like asking mtgox to be transparent about their AML.
Not gonna happen.

Also the 3-hour average is only 13Gh/s!  You're looking at the wrong line on the chart.  The 15-minute average can be way, way off if you hit a lucky streak.

No, that is yet another one of those incredibly farsighted decisions by Satoshi.  Think of this as "practice" for when the 1MB hard limit is hit.

Calling them "passports" is misleading.  One of the important features of a passport is that each human being can only have one of them (from a given country).

Yeah, I was not impressed with Coinabul's delivery security when I ordered from then.  Nothing went wrong, but I could see how it easily could have.  Didn't order again.

Their ridiculous account limits lead most people to regard it as nothing more than a toy.  Sorry to be harsh, but it's annoying, and they keep saying "yeah yeah we will lift the limits next week" but it never happens.

I don't think that means they are actually working on it.  It's sort of a customer service nicety.  I bet if you asked whether they accepted Zimbabwe dollars they'd say they were "working on it".

Actually this gives us a fair bit of insight as to which fab they're using.  We can cross TSMC off the list for sure.

Indeed.  Continues to amaze me.  Never before have I seen a site with such a contrast between the articles and the comments.

Only interested if it issues the PIN code automatically after X confirms, i.e. I don't have to wait for a human to intervene on your end and issue the code.  That's my biggest gripe with the existing services.  Takes 24+ hours to finish the transaction and by that time I forgot about it.

Hitler is definitely in on the scam.

Shorting things is only easy in the "real" markets because of government backstops.  Shorting always exposes the security lender to counterparty risk from the borrower (the person selling short).  This sort of borrowing is risky since there is unlimited upside, and so the lender will demand a commensurate interest rate.
Bitcoinica proved this in spectacular fashion.  Everybody massively underpriced the counterparty risk they were exposing themselves to by storing their BTC at Bitcoinica.  Now that people have woken up, they're going to demand very high rates of interest in order to lend their BTC to somebody in order that it can be sold short.
