Everything is volatile, but fuck those bitcoin transfer fees and transfer times.

What is the upside of running a node? Do you get coins like you would if you were mining?

I really wish you told me! I heard about it on NPR all the time driving to work back when it was around 700. But i didn't know how to buy it and didn't really understand it. I'm in now. Super late. But I have some BTC.
Still trying to figure out weather any other coin actually has a probable chance of going up like
Bitcoin did. ETH sounds Interesting I fee like they are Mac to windows 95 back in the day.
Ripple and lumens catch my eye because I know banks will eventually get into crypto but they aren't going to go for BTC since it's price is already so high and transfer times etc.
Is there a website that gives somewhat unbiased crypto news? Something like a BBC news for crypto?

I've been kicking myself for taking this long to get into buying it. I finally did at a fraction of 1 coin but now with what I know I will just keep buying a little here and there every month and build up to 1 coin then 2. Gotta take this one coin at a time.
