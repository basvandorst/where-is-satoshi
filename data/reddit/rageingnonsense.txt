I think it is a sobering reminder of why we seem to have so many regulations. For every seemingly stupid regulation (or not so stupid sounding one), there was a person who screwed people over doing the thing that the regulation prevents.

This pretty much sums it up. The moment people start trading it I stead of using it is the day it was doomed.

This is denying human nature. The very people who are drawn to make these exchanges are in it for the money, and if they can see a way to legally make money, even if it screws you, they 10000% percent will. Oh maybe they started it without that in mind, but when they see millions of potential dollars in front of them basically for the taking; good luck trusting them to not act on it. Bad actors will leave and be replaced by more bad actors. This has been going on since before recorded history in one form or another. 
They don't self select themselves for death; they succeed and run with the money. who cares if their exchange dies, they are ALREADY RICH. There is no incentive whatsoever to be honest.

This is my assessment of things. If I were the head of an organization like NACHA (national american clearing house something), I would be very interested in the blockchain *technology* to keep track of transactions. I would have exactly zero interest in any specific coin (other than analyzing the tech behind it).

Aware of it in the context of a get rich quick scheme. Nobody is looking at bitcoin and saying "Oh wow I can buy a Tesla with Bitcoins? I can order a pizza with Bitcoins?". The public sees it and only sees something that is worth a lot of DOLLARS. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:25:05
If bitcoins were a dollar each, I would consider buying some. at 5k? Risky. At 10k+? Absolutely absurd.

Everything in life is waves. What happened in the past will happen again.

It might just be the times. Look at what has happened to real estate. Many people buy homes not to live in, but as an investment. A gargantuan amount oi investing right now is based on pure speculation. We are truly in for some hard times in the near future.

Gold actually has a material use. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:02:58
Seems to me like it is being treated as a commodity, like gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:18:33
I think this is incorrect. I would be more inclined to agree with you if I saw major retailers accepting bitcoins. If that were the case, then I would understand why the value is where it is at. This is not the case though. The value is going up because more people are buying the coin, and that is it. Its only worth what it is because some poor schmuck is willing to pay me that much to get one.
Anyone who truly believes in the coin as a currency should be alarmed at how it is being treated by people who are turning it into a pyramid scheme. This hurts the coin in the longrun. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:27:20
This is a great point. Houses at least have utility. The point I was trying to make though is that people buy homes for investment as much as people are buying Bitcoin for investment (as opposed to actually believing in it, and using it as currency). 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:25:35
Because Bitcoin has become a pyramid scheme where the only way to increase value is to con people into buying it, so it is imperative that as many people as possible get seduced by "wow look at how much it keeps going up! you are gonna miss out!". 
It's incredibly predatory, and is entirely destructive to the future of the coin as a currency because when the bubble pops, people won't want to touch it with a 20 foot pole (at least for a long time). 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:35:56
It can be both, but growth at this rate is terrible for the coin. Not only for the coin, but the global economy.
When the bubble bursts (and it will), it will take semiconductor stocks with it. When that happens, it may trigger a big price correction in the stock market (which it is due for). This is recession territory. 
Even if you do not care about the stock market, it is BAD for the coin. No government is going to tolerate a rouge investment vehicle that drags markets down with it, and causes a recession.
This might sound hyperbolic (and maybe it is!), but crypto is a big factor in the current price of semiconductor stocks. A failure in crypto could mean a failure in those stocks, and could trigger a domino effect.

I dunno what those people will say; I just know what I say.

It has one minor spike in 2013 that slowly went down. It is nothing compared to the insane bubble happening right now. It went from $1000 in April this year to the current $6500. That's around 7 months. That's insanity.

Like a pyramid, if you will.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:33:25
The mining is the processing of transactions right? What happens when we run out of Bitcoins? What becomes the incentive to process transactions? Or am I woefully incorrect about this?
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:09:24
I looked at a couple of these bitcoin debit cards (which I had no idea existed). This is pretty cool, but it still just converts your bitcoin into local currency when you use it. If I spend 0.01 bitcoins at a store, they don't actually get 0.01 bitcoins, they get the local currency. So we have people running these cards, and every time someone uses it, the bank (is it s bank?) buys the bitcoin back from the user, increasing their horde of bitcoins. It's not actually transferred to anyone. So how does the the bank use it? They have to transfer it back to a real currency. How do they not go broke? They have to continually pump the value of the bitcoin up. 
Are people really using bitcoin as a currency (giving bitcoin and accepting bitcoin), not just using bitcoin to convert to local currency? I'd be far less skeptical if I could go to the corner store and give someone actual bitcoin, not just currency exchange it on the spot. Then I know there is a real economy based on it. As it stands right now, it is just a commodity.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:56:40
As someone from the outside looking in, who toyed with the idea of investing in it, but ultimately decided not to; these are the things that keep me skeptical of it:
* It's not very liquid. I can't spend bitcoin at the supermarket, corner store, Amazon, etc. As it stands, it is just a commodity being traded (and a strange one at that). Some people accept bitcoins, but only because they plan to turn it into real money.
* If it did gain hold enough that people began to use it over other currencies, what is to stop governments from blocking its usage with laws? Saddam Hussein wanted to stop trading oil in US dollars, and now he is dead for it. 
* Why is the value going up? Because more people are buying it obviously. What justifies the current price? Nothing. Nothing but the fact that there are people willing to spend that much for it. So what happens when people decide to cash out? You could argue that a lot of markets are like this, but this is the only market that does not trade a tangible good. It's basically a pyramid scheme where you require more and more people to buy in so you can profit (and by profit, I mean turning it into real money). 
Its these reasons that make me hesitant to buy a bitcoin. At the price it is at it is way way way too risky for me. 
Don't get me wrong. I am super happy for anyone who bought these early on for pennies and are rich from it now. That's awesome! But, I feel bad for the people who will buy it at the cusp, and then lose a LOT of money when the pyramid crumbles. 
I'm open to other insights on this.

Government currencies are backed by muscle. Bitcoin is backed by nothing. If people start using bitcoin, and it is untraced, and the governments of the world cant accurately tax people anymore; you can bet your ass Bitcoin will be regulated to high heaven. This is the end gamer for Bitcoin if it gets that far. 
There may be a future for cryptocurrency, and there is DEFINITELY a future for blockchain technology; but the idea that governments will roll over for it is... shortsighted.

I can make stuff with gold (electronics, jewelry, etc). I can build on land, farm it, rent it, etc. Stocks are capital the company I invest in uses to fund projects which are hopefully profitable, and if so, justifies  stock price because it is backed by a profitable company. Some even pay dividends back to the holder. 
I can't do anything with Bitcoin other than say I hold a bitcoin, and to exchange it for real money. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:14:09
Blockchain technology is great, but it doesn't have to be tied to the coin. There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies now. If I want to be able to use blockchain technology for something, I could just buy some other coin for fractions of a penny. 
Or are you saying the value in bitcoin is not in the coin itself, but the talent behind the coin?
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:14:52
I sure hope it does for your sake!
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:27:42
I understand your arguments, but can't one separate the blockchain technology from the coin? The technology itself is great, but the coin?
You don't have to block the exchanges to block the adoption of the coin. You can do stuff like make it illegal for banks to offer wallets to people. You can make it illegal for businesses to accept bitcoin as legal tender. Will people still try to do it? Sure, but you are not going to see Amazon breaking the law, or any other company. 
Look, I am willing to accept that I could be totally wrong. you are right, there are so many variables, and who can predict the future? but, with the wild fluctuation of the value of Bitcoin, I am not feeling the risk. Maybe if it gained a steady 2 - 5% of value per year. 
I'm very interested in seeing where this all goes. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:10:23
Calculated risk though. And from what I can see, this is an obvious price spike/bubble.
