Hi there,
We've been over this so many times now.
You might want to also tell the people here why that is. That you ADMITTED to use fraudulent details, and broke the terms of the site by opening multiple accounts to try to gain an advantage through receiving bonuses.
You also tried to slander our brand by telling publicly that the CEO of our platform provider was going to shut us down, which he denied publicly and called you a liar. So anyone here might wanna check that out too.
We both discussed this on the largest arbitration site online, Casinomeister, where they eventually banned you because you broke the rules there too. 
There's two sides of every coin.
Oh here's the Casinomeister thread, where you also got banned for "Acting like a Jerk".
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:54:46
Hi there,
If you type in any casino followed by the word "Scam" on google, you'll find that every casino is an apparent scam. 
Now to your case. The the terms clearly states that the bonus is only available for one IP as per the terms. If you do open up multiple accounts in an attempt to get spins, that's called abuse. 
All customer offers are limited to one per person, family, household address, email address, telephone number, same payment account number (e.g. debit or credit card, NETeller etc), IP, and shared computer, e.g. public library or workplace.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:07:55
Both practically and morally, first of all, it's against the rules to take more than one introductory offer, and it would be immortal to break that rule to take advantage of it.
Well, at the end of the day, we're all gonna have our opinions, which is totally fine to me. The thing I care about the most is that all information is on the table so people can make an educated decision about the situation. The biggest problem to me is when people jump to conclusions without hearing both sides.
I'm totally fine with our opinions differing as long as we can put all info out there and have a rational discussion.
I respect your opinion of course, and thank you for being able to have a rational discussion in a civilized manner, honoring the etikett of a serious debate. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:59:00
He already has at CasinoMeister and broke the rules there too...

Hi there,
To give our side of the story. 
Upon processing your withdrawal we discovered that you have 3 accounts in total that has been opened
not just from the same IP, but from the same browser, which goes against the terms and conditions of the site.
We're not just talking about opening accounts, but they all have activity on them in terms of bonus uptake and
deposits. This breaches the following rule of the site:
You are allowed to have only one Member Account. Only one Account for each household, IP, PC is allowed. If you attempt to open more than one Member Account, all accounts you try to open may be blocked or closed and any bets may be voided. Also any returns, deposits, winnings or bonuses which you have gained or accrued during such time as the Duplicate Account was active will be forfeited by you and may be reclaimed by us, and you will return to us on demand any such funds which have been withdrawn from the Duplicate Account. If you wish to open another account, you may do so by contacting the Manager at support If a new account is opened, the old account will be closed. If you notice that you have more than one registered Member Account you must notify us immediately. Failure to do so may lead to your Member account being blocked for access.
Furthermore, you also admitted to entering fake details to your member account to the live chat agent
upon us making a KYC on your account which we have proof of here:
This is breaching the following term:
All information that You provide to Bitstarz.com during the term of validity of this agreement is true, complete, and correct, and that You shall immediately notify Bitstarz.com of any change of such information.
If you wish to dispute this, please state your side of the argument.

We're still talking about breaking rules here. So if you're tech-savvy or not, the same rules apply for you. Again, I will use the store analogy. 
Just because you're great at stealing things (smart and tech-savvy) it doesn't mean that it's ok to do so, it's still breaking the law. You with me?
Some people might be better at breaking the law than others, but it makes no difference to the original question.

Hi there, 
Well, it's interesting that so many would jump to conclusions without hearing both sides of the story. 
I would recommend looking through the CasinoMeister thread where you posted the same comment, and got banned for not following the rules, and that's the biggest player/casino arbitration site in the World.
Also, nice that you say that you have chat transcripts, but don't post them. So allow me to do that, where you admit to breaking the rules of the site.
Upon processing your withdrawal we discovered that you have 3 accounts in total that has been opened
not just from the same IP, but from the same browser, which goes against the terms and conditions of the site.

Well, yeah, it's a tough one when both sides of the story are not looked at. Yes, he won, but he broke multiple rules doing so. Again, you can get money doing a lot of illegal things, but that doesn't mean you're keeping the money. Very simple logic.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:56:50
I hear what you're saying, but there must be a consequence of a player breaking the rules. To me, that's like robbing the bank (breaking the law), and not being stopped, and then getting a portion of it back.
Again, it's not just him breaking the multiple account rule, he also admitted to committing false information. It's basically like trying to use a fake-ID.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:54:35
So, again, if you walk into the store, steals something and nobody bats an eye, it was OK for you to steal. Just because we didn't catch him right away, doesn't mean he can get away with breaking the rules.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:51:33
I believe many companies have introduction offers to new players, but that doesn't mean that you can take them more than once to try to take advantage of that. Right? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:26:06
Sure thing, I understand that not everyone is a casino player here.
It can be an advantage, if you decide to take multiple bonuses on each account which this player did, on all of them.
If you want me to clear out anything else, let me know!
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:10:21
No, you entered false details on your account, making up all the details that was asked of you, and you admitted to doing so here.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:43:04
I'll give you a hint, you can also eat it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:15:19
Hi there,
Interesting, so you mean that rules don't apply to anyone? If you go into a store and steal something, and they are not able to stop you, you're just free to go?
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:13:16
I took a screenshot of it, that's not the same thing as writing it. I recommend you writing to them and ask them in an email for their official statement, I'm sure they'll repeat that for you.
Besides, Pavel never said anything about being a friend of yours, he gave you this reply:
Stop making things up now.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:20:20
Man, time to give it up.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:07:15
You admitted to putting fake details which you did. Holland as a country, Amsterdam as city, A fake street, and I could go on further. And you admitted to only a couple of the details being true. In the screenshot above. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:53:15
Hi there,
It was upon him admitting the error that we closed him down, not sure if that was clear enough.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:23:11
Haha! This is actually starting to get kind of funny.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:18:31
Excellent question. We would love to see proof of that too. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:03:14
Hi there,
Right. At Casinos we offer for example bonuses, which adds value to your account. Such as free rounds and match deposit bonus offers. It decreases the margin on the player and is an advantage.
If you open up multiple accounts to grab multiple bonuses on many accounts, this becomes and increasing advantage. You know what I'm saying?
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:57:58
Hi there,
I don't think you read that through properly. It's not the case of the player using 3 different browsers on the same machine. He used the SAME browser for all his 3 accounts.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:26:36
For everything you post, we have proof that all you post is nonsense, and you're the one who will look foolish with your lies, so sure, go for it. Thanks for the publicity!
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:46:42
You mean Softswiss? Sure thing, can you post it here? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:27:49
Hi there,
I'm not sure if you're understanding the above point correctly.
If you break multiple rules that you have agreed to for using the site, you are not entitled to the winnings, it's as simple as that.

@_date: 2017-08-31 13:27:21
Drum roll! Well, you've claimed to have proof of such, but you don't seem very keen to post it. Please do, would be awesome to see that.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:30:53
Do you think that CasinoMeister would take any risk defending a small casino like us when they're the largest casino affiliate site in the World?
Do you think they would risk their reputation defending us for no reason? I think not. They also said that they would give a full investigation, but you kept breaking the rules to the point where they got sick of you breaching the rules so they decided not to pursuit with your claim.
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:48:30
Not sure what that had to do with us being broke. I think you're mixing apples and pears here. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:37:09
Hi there,
In all casinos that I'm aware of, a KYC check is done upon withdrawal of funds (unless requested earlier by the player) and it was at this stage we saw multiple violation of the casino terms. 
When the player opened the account, he promised to abide to the terms of the site, which he did not do, and there were more than just one of which he violated.
He also confessed to this upon requesting his withdrawal.
Kind Regards,

Hi there,
Well, you're getting a 15x wagering on a bonus, everyday for 7 days if you don't win. To be fair, it's pretty hard to find that kind of wagering for a bonus. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:29:32
Hi there,
It's your responsibility for not breaking the rules. It's like staying "The bank didn't stop me when I robbed it, so I guess that was ok".
I think it's quite ironic as well that you opened up 3 accounts on CasinoMeister which they all banned because you did break the rules of opening up multiple accounts there.
You did not just break the rules by opening up multiple accounts, you also admitted to submitting false details on your account, which is also breaking the rules.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:07:32
Oh it's actually Olle speaking right now if that helps for that matter!
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:46:34
If the rules was easy to break, I'd be on your side.
But in this instance, the player created and was active on 3 different accounts which breaks the terms of any casino in the World, and that was just one violation of the terms.
I don't think it's easy to create multiple accounts in order to take advantage of multiple bonuses in the casino, I think that's a deliberate action on the player's part.

Hi there,
Nope, but if we allowed all players who broke the rules to get away with it, it would be a problem. Both monetary and out of principle. 
We believe the facts are on our side, and that's why we're not scared getting the truth out there. 
As mentioned, we believe in transparency, putting both sides of the story out there, and then people can make up their own minds.
I also believe paying him out, despite breaking multiple terms is also unfair to the thousands of players that are abiding by the rules.
Kind Regards,
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:11:05
You can submit anything you want. We've also submitted our side of the story, and if you want to go post online that you broke the rules of the site, and also admitted to doing so, you're more than welcome.
@_date: 2016-11-02 05:16:43
Again, with the cheating term, it's quite hard to know beforehand what a person could use as a method for cheating, exactly as mentioned above, hence the rule.
I can't speak for other casinos you've played at, but at BitStarz, we'd never deny you a bonus because of a person from the same province have used the bonus, that sounds crazy to me. It would be interesting how that could be deemed as abuse.
With that being said, I kindly ask you to understand why it's there in the first place (in our case), I feel I've elaborated pretty well on why we need it. We'd never take any actions against a player unless they were for example opening 5 accounts and trying to get cashback on all of them, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:31:41
Perfect, let everybody out there make up their minds.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:17:31

If you didn't have in mind to abuse the casino by opening up multiple accounts and enter fraudulent information to your account, you'd be more than welcome to play at BitStarz and part-take in the generous promos we have to offer.
But no worries, best of luck in another casino!
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:17:59
Hi there,
50 mBTC or 20 EUR are the right amounts, just to clarify that, also I guess that if you're looking for a 100% refund if you don't win, that's not the case here. So I can agree that it might be misinterpreted, we'll do our best to clear that up.
Regard the term would very rarely be used of course, I don't think we've ever excluded a player from this promotion in the past. It's just something the casino could lean back on in case someone tried to abuse the promotion in any way.
If you go into a casino in Vegas, they wouldn't be able to state all the ways a player could cheat in the casino, people invent new methods to try to abuse and cheat, therefore they have the right to throw out anyone who is deemed to manipulate the outcome of any game, same goes here :)
But if you come in with genuine intentions, there's no way you could be thrown out.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:59:41
We've already posted proof that you opened multiple accounts, but I'm sure people can see that in the other 15 threads you've made. It's a little annoying to repeat ourselves.

Here you are admitting to filling in false details. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:27:44
Hi there,
I think this was a support mistake as they made an IP check on your account and found multiple players
using the same IP, without taking into consideration that a VPN could be used here. 
I will personally ask them to pay you out in full. Your account should be open in a few minutes and 
the money should be there soon so you can experience the fast BitStarz withdrawals.
Kind Regards,
Olle, BitStarz

Hi there,
I'm sorry to say man but you're quite misinformed.
Saying that we have a bunch of rules set in place to screw winning players over is just ridiculous and I think you're deep down aware of that too.
I also know that you posted a complaint on AG and got denied by them as it was not an legitimate complain and now trying to spread biased information. If you complain to a neutral site and got shut down because of an a non-legit claim, there's no reason for you to spend a bunch of slanderous information online claiming that the majority of our players are screwed over. Someone with even the slightest feel for critical thinking could tear that apart pretty quickly.
If you don't like BitStarz, you're free to play anywhere else you like, but there's no reason to spread lies about us online.
@_date: 2016-09-18 00:25:51
Hi there,
To be fair, if it's in the terms and conditions, I have a hard time seeing that we're stealing money from someone. If it's stated clearly there, we're not stealing it, it's the player not following the terms of use, and this is a common one.
You also have to understand that technical implementation might sound like an easy thing, and we have in the pipeline to get that automatically set, but in that time we have to lay it out somewhere.
@_date: 2016-09-19 01:01:02
Hi there,
Absolutely, sorry I didn't mean to avoid anything.
Well, if someone is unwilling to go through the KYC checks, that person is putting themselves in a pretty tight position. The money will remain on the account until the player is sending the docs in.
@_date: 2016-09-17 22:25:02
Hi OPSEC,
I understand where you're coming from, and I hear you.
If has has used any card in the past, it's important for us that all methods of deposits has been verified prior to a withdrawal being made. I understand what you're saying as the BTC is not connected
to the card in any way, but it still causes concern from a license issuers point of view and we want to make sure that we're all up to date with documents being sent it. We want to be on the safe side so to speak.
Also, I'd like to point out that it's not like we're confiscating this money from the stated player and decide to go on a shopping spree for it. That's not what we're doing here. We're simply asking the player to send in a copy of the CC and once that's done we'll be sending the money straight to him. 
When it comes to freezing an account altogether prior to deposits being made; we're doing our best to verify documents as soon as they're sent in, but we cannot guarantee that the documents are being verified as soon as they've been sent in as a proper check takes some time, especially as there are so many coming in (but we obviously can guarantee that they're 100% checked when a withdrawal request is being made). I do realize that in a perfect world, they should be verified right away.
@_date: 2016-09-18 00:36:42
Hi there,
Again, we're following our terms and conditions, which the player have agreed to. You can have opinions on the terms and conditions, but if we're following the terms, I'm not sure that it would qualify as a scam.
@_date: 2016-09-19 01:02:38
Hi there,
I'm glad we were able to work this thing out, again, it was never our intention to deliberately keep you from getting the money. We want to be able to pay you out, but then again we have a promise to keep to our license issuer and stay within the law.
Thanks so much for complying so we could get a happy ending!
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:49:47
Hi there,
Once again, we're going to pay the player as soon as the complies to sending in a copy of his CC. Simple as that. It would be interesting to hear about this shitty reputation as we're top ranked on AskGamblers.
If you scout around online you can find negative feedback and positive feedback of any casino. But the reputation on AG is quite solid (top 3 out of 1000 casinos). 
In a battle between Ford and Chevy, I'm sure you can find good and bad feedback anywhere online, positive and negative experiences.
I hope you find another site you like better, you have the right to choose wherever you want to play.
@_date: 2016-09-18 16:14:36
Hi Kelly,
As my previous reply:
Some people might thing of it being backwards but casinos are not required to verify any details prior to depositing. Then of course one can argue why there are not such legislation in place. No major casino or sports book is doing this till this day.
There are very seldom complaints about this, and would cause the majority of players (who wants to play right away) to be very impatient. If a player has nothing to worry about, there will be no hassle to get the money out, but you have to understand that when someone is refusing to send in docs, that causes some issues here.
However, there might be a good idea to make everyone do it.
@_date: 2016-09-17 22:36:46
Hi guys,
I'd also take the opportunity to write some comments freely here.
BitStarz is one of the top ranked casinos on AskGamblers, something we're quite proud of. Then again I'm sure there's people out there who also believe this could be a big conspiracy too, what do I know. All we can do is put all the facts out there and people can make up their own mind, because at the end of the day, it's the most fair way.
I understand that reading through terms and conditions can be a tough task as many casinos have endless points of TnCs that looks like they're just there to screw people over, but in fact many of them are actually needed to combat fraud. 
For all genuine people who are playing out there, there's also a big wave of fraudsters trying to abuse promotions, scammers, users stolen cards etc, which means we have to be on our toes every day.
But as long as you have a legit claim, it's very hard to get screwed over and at the end of the day it's important to comply with the terms. If you use a card, be prepared to send it in. If someone is opening up 100 accounts via your IP, we'll card you. It's as simple as that.
So shine some light on this too. At BitStarz, we're a handful of guys trying to do our best to provide the best casino experience. Some people might like us, some might hate us, that's up to everyone. But any claim and every question will be taken seriously, you have my word.
We believe in fair practice and we'll try to be as transparent as we possibly can and if anyone have general casino questions or questions about BitStarz, hit me up. I'm not an unreasonable person by any means.
@_date: 2016-09-18 00:26:50

Hi there,
Again, it's not our rule I'm afraid. We're simply following the rules of our license issuer. It's the same thing with laws, you may have opinions on them and you can express that, but that doesn't mean you have to break the law.
We're just following the rules here, and calling us a non-legit casino because we're following the rules that our license issuer has set in place, I'm sorry but I'm having a hard time finding the logic in that.
Let's say we were to break the rules, then someone else would come and say that we were non-legit. So you form your own opinion here, that's all I can say.
@_date: 2016-09-18 00:31:00
Hi there,
That's your opinion and I respect that, even though it would be nice to hear a little more constructive criticism, but that's up to you.
Thankfully you have the right to play anywhere you like, so I wish you the best of luck wherever that might be.
Have a great day,
@_date: 2016-09-17 20:12:45
Hi there,
I'm working for BitStarz, so I just wanted to clear this up real quick. If you're making deposits with a card, all casinos have an obligation to ask for a copy of the card used, it doesn't matter if it was used a year ago or used yesterday. This is nothing unique for us, but a requirement from our casino license issuer, which a legit casino has. Again, we're not making this up just to make things difficult for you.
All we need to make sure here is that no stolen card has been used, and you're of course free to mask the first 12 numbers of the card if you feel uncomfortable showing all the numbers (which we totally understand).
I'm not going to discuss publicly (for your own safety as I'm not going to out your private information online) why we came to this conclusion as I believe you'd like to hear this in private instead of it being posted on a forum. But in general  terms I have no problem explaining why a casino ask for proof of deposits and a copy of your card.
I'm just putting all the facts out from our end as well and then you and other people here can make an educated decision as to if it's reasonable or not, but I'm simply telling you the obligations of us as an operator.
If you don't have your card anymore, you can simply ask your bank to provide a letter where they explain that this card was in your possession at one point.
Kind Regards,
@_date: 2016-09-18 16:29:49
Hi there,
Wherever you go online, you'll find positive and negative info on any casino. That BitStarz is the best casino, that we're the worst casino, that Bovada is great, and that they're a bunch of scammers.
But it's easy to go out and find selective negative information on any casino, try google and you'll see what I mean.
If you check for example AskGamblers where the majority of serious reviews of casinos are collected, we're top 3 of 1000 casinos. But yeah, you can find selective negative or positive casinos on anything.

As he should be able to find the last 4 digits on an old card linked to a bank account, all we would need is a letter form a bank confirming this.

Hi Mikadily,
Thanks for the question, if you have more, please feel free to shoot them my way. Again, I'm not here to try to play some kind of big bully, I'm simply here to try to show you how it is from an operator perspective. 
You are correct. The money has to be withdrawn the same way it came. The way we check that everything adds up is that we check name of the player will be on the card so it's easy to pair that up with the ID a player has to send in for verification. We also have means to check via our payment systems who the real owner of the card is (so it cannot be faked via photoshop).
As an operator we also go through quite a few IDs and are pretty good at spotting fake documents by eyeing them (but also thanks for the systems we have in place), no method is flawless but you can get pretty close. If the details do not match up, it will be reported as fraud. 
Again, I hope that answers you question, if you have any more, let me know! I'd also be happy to open a "Ask an operator" thread!

Hi there,
Are you able to contact your bank if we give you the last 4 digits of the card? Again, we're not trying to prevent you from getting the money, I want to give them to you as well.
I'm not going to give you a part of the bitcoin, I'm going to give you all the Bitcoins as long as I get the requested information. I can't make a deal with you simply because it's against the legislation, and I wouldn't want to take your money.
You can spread any word you like out there, but I'm not going to break the law Sir and if you want to go out and spread the word online that BitStarz is a bad casino because they stick to legislation, then I cannot help you.
Again, I'm asking you to contact us via our site and discuss this as I do not want to discuss your matter with other people (more than in a general sense).

Hi there,
Again, this has nothing to do with a larger sum, and once again, we haven't taken any money from him, we're simply asking him to send in the documents and we'll send him the money.

Hi there,
I hear what you're saying, but if we do not get proof of a card from the player as an operator that could mean a license gets in jeopardy. 
It's in the guideline of obligations from our license issuer that we need to get a copy of the card used. Doesn't matter if it is stolen or not, used today or 5 years ago.
As you have to understand, there might be things in these obligations that we deem to be unnecessary too, believe me, but nevertheless we have to follow the rules laid out for us.
Just as the same way some laws in general might be weird and defying it's purpose, but that doesn't mean we can break them, you know what I mean?

Yeah, and we didn't land on the moon, the World Cup of -52 never happened and the earth is flat too.

Hi there again,
Just wanted to let you guys know about the update regarding this matter. As we have now confirmed with our payments department that the cards u/DjPxH had used were indeed prepaid cards, we no longer need verification documents regarding these. Normally this process does not take very long but due to night time &amp; weekend it prolonged a few hours unfortunately. This was already communicated with the player in question 7 hours ago.
The standard KYC procedure (proof of address and proof of identity) still stands and as we have already received proof of address there is just one documents missing.
When we have received this we will immediately process the withdrawals.
