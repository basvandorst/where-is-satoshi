If we look at Ethereum, a reference in the Shitcoin class:
Ethereum was, at best, a marketing operation. Flawed from beginning by the 'big blockers' mistake. Now the software is just 'unusable'. I'm sure nobody who owns Ethereum, runs a full node. And even if they have a full node, they can't do anything, that can be done on a Bitcoin full node. Ethereum was a premined coin, and a marketing operation of buzzwords. These buzzwords were meaningless from the beginning. Not a single useful decentralized dapp was developed. Decentralization, in a top-down process is non-sensical too. Everything was craziness, and nonsense.
Who cares about the price of Ethereum. In five years, it will be zero, the stories of shitcoins are always the same. Now, it's time for this crap to disappear. The main key price support against Bitcoin is definitively broken; This shitcoin will not come back from here.
The congress gets it right: There's Bitcoin and Then There's Shitcoin.

Bank confidently is important; And comparing, Swiss accounts, like this country is a new kind of soviet union, where the state must know everything on everyone...

Bitcoin is designed to minimized the cost to operate a full node; Bitcoin will be operational for decades...

You have to be realistic; Ethereum was, at best, a marketing operation. Flawed from beginning by the 'big blockers' mistake. Now the software is just 'unusable'. I'm sure you are not running a full Ethereum node. And, nobody does...

If you want to have all the economic details. The book: 'The Bitcoin Standard' by Saifedean Ammous is the right one.

Incorrect; Smartcontract is just a buzzword. Bitcoin has already a language, optimal for critical security operations. This thread is a good explanation: [
**Lightning** runs on Bitcoin and Bitcoin only. This is the only anti-censorship fully decentralized app operational today.
Ethereum with all the money they have, didn't delivered a single anti-censorship fully decentralized app... The full concept is flawed at the Ethereum level, because Ethereum can't scale, and ETH 2.0 will not save them. Javascript called smartcontract is just meaningless. And a centralized company like Ethereum can't deliver an anti-censorship resistant app platform, this is just a pipe dream...

And this never happened, no development done on a sh\*tcoin was transferred back to Bitcoin. The work done is just worthless, or just too doubtful (premine, checkpoints...).
Anyway, we can thanks Litecoin to be a second testnet for Bitcoin.

Money is a winner take all game. There is no need for a number 2. Bitcoin is the King. Hail the King!
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:05:40
Or Ethereum, using javascript as language. This is not an innovation, but pure marketing and buzzwords: 'Smartcontract' and 'Solidity'...
The real development on a sh\*tcoin is on the premine, or the instamine, or adding a tax on the mining. Or allowing the usage of ASICs for the insiders only, and so on...
At the end of the day, this is just tricks to get an easy financial gain, at the expense of some naive sh\*tcoiners. And they will learn the hard way what sh\*tcoin means.

Do you think that replacing the reverse-polish native language of Bitcoin by javascript adds any value to Ethereum?
You must read these threads, and look behind the buzzwords:
Lightning is built on Bitcoin, and uses extensively the native language of Bitcoin. Do you have a single project's name with proper anti-censorship properties, and without any centralized operation, working on Ethereum? None, of course. So, what's the point of Ethereum, everything done was already possible, before Bitcoin was ever invented.

Some info:
@_date: 2019-11-13 10:04:11
The only relevant questions you can ask to somebody like Vitalik:
* When you introduce a new scamcoin optimized to print free money, and designed with an extreme premine. How can you choose your audience, and the narrative, to pump the price?
* Is there a best way than PoS to get interest on the free money you printed before?
* How to prevent people to look closely, and to try to understand how the operation work. And keep them focus only on the narrative, and the get rich scheme?
* The exit scam stage is the most difficult. How do you think it will happen?

BCASH is a proof that internal attacks are doomed to fail. Bitcoin is now stronger and anti-fragile. And can't be stopped.

A lot of people can't agree with Andreas on the Ethereum part; And I'm one of them. In my opinion *easy money* like Ethereum can have a corrupting influence on a lot of people. Andreas is not an exception. But now Liquid + RSK make the Ethereum 2.0 concept/rhetoric obsolete. If something useful exists, it will be done at the Bitcoin level. The only *smartcontract* decentralized application we have today is *Lightning.* Nothing decentralized can be built on a centralized system like Ethereum anyway.

'limited scalability of this currency': The Gresham's law is the real raison why Bitcoin is not used as a daily currency, not the TPS. Lightning fixes this; But you will never use a *hard money* to buy something when people are still accepting *easy money*.
Bitcoin is fully decentralized / Ethereum is fully centralized. Ethereum will end like Libra, if it becomes too big. No future. And you can't run a fully validating Ethereum node anyway using a standard PC. Ethereum is already obsolete at the software level too. Don't trust but verify; Ethereum is just another premined scamcoin.

I agree; Ethereum is a scam: But sadly *easy money* like Ethereum can have a corrupting influence on a lot of people.

Jimmy Song is right. What are you expecting?. Like in our classical industrial world, steel will be more valuable than Gold, because steel is more useful than Gold to make tools: screwdrivers, nails...
Yes, I forget, steel is worthless as a material.  The only certainty, Ethereum is less useful than Steel!

If we leave aside trading; Tone Vays is good for Bitcoin, and bad for scamcoins. So, he did the job!

Monero is not scarce, and definitively, too buggy, and too experimental to be taken seriously as a SoV by people from the Bitcoin World. Money is a winner take all situation. There is no need for a number 2. The utility itself of Monero is already undermined by Lightning and Shnorr.
@_date: 2019-12-02 19:47:00
Yes, I'm comparing steel vs Gold. Why do you think Gold was valuable as money; And, steel never was. But, steel is more useful.

Scams are a topic without end...

I'm a realist, something like Ethereum is only useful when the price can be pumped with marketing. The last devcon failure is something to remember!
Bitcoin has a fundamental value: related to the decentralization.
Ethereum: none.
