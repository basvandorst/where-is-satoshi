What's that got to do with bitcoin?

Why not? Show the transaction on the exchange where you bought, and show when you sold. You don't necessarily have to use the blockchain, just site logs are probably sufficient.


Use your signature to prove coins are yours.
But this is all hard for me to say without knowing what your really talking about. Are you talking about trading on exchanges, or in person or are you talking about buying and selling goods/services using bitcoin

I'd imagine the same way any other business would prove their losses.


No but you probably bought/sold on some exchange and that exchange shows a history of your transactions. Or if you traded on something like localbitcoins i believe they do transaction receipts.


You get the receipt for that purchase the same as you would with any other currency.

How is bitcoin exposing illegitimate operations?

You already can do that. You can see which addresses are using multiple signatures. But it doesn't matter how safe you make the tools for people. There's still going to be people who are extremely incompetent. Which was the case with bitfinex. And it wasn't the first time they've shown incompetence either.

If you say we're down due to issues when really you've been attacked and traffic redirected then some one might still go to their webpage see that it's "working" and reasonably decide that it's back up and safe to use.
It's not giving nerdy details, it's making customers aware that the webpage their seeing isn't actually your webpage and shouldn't be used.

A self post with an incoherent title and no expansion. How did this get any upvotes?

Can someone make some estimate on when they believe the value will stabilize and what value they see it stabilizing at?

Yeah very confusing. He goes on about the people in willing to do some work for bitcoin and then asks us to make something for him instead. And doesn't really explain what he wants.
Also doesn't seem to exist.
