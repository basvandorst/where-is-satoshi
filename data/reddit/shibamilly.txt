I've been building full-featured online software for 20 years and Bettermeans.com looks like a really good system to start from. 
The level of complexity however means that it would require full-time project manager and a fully committed developer on retainer. Also, an injection of Ethereum would be nice ;)
Years ago, I created a proposal for the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation for such a system (though it is applied to philanthropy education and management). Then I sort of fell into a bitcoin hole of obsession and left it aside. Since I am not sure I can fin a job or start a company in Bitcoin because it is turning into a den of blehhhh and yuuuuck, I started working on Kuvert again. Turns out crypto-currency was the missing link in my DAO gamified crowd-sourced management process!
Here it is explained in the context of philanthropy.

So much work to do before people can use it easily though :)

Having read all of the supplied documents (including archives going back to the 90s) I think I have a good idea of the dynamics involved because they represent the Hollywood M.O. Given that the whole purpose of Hollywood is to create a funnel that provides young people to take advantage of sexually, it's really surprising that they manage to make good movies sometimes.
The issue here is that Brock Pierce's friends are at the center of a systemic abuse ring that involves high-profile individuals who are being named by one of many victims of the ring. Pierce is a child actor who turned his relationship with a pedophile into many business ventures. That is not really a good thing because all it tells us is that he has the potential to use his education to do the exact same thing (victimization enabling for business and political power). It's already surprising that Hollywood Reporter did a piece on this so it has the potential to reverberate forever and ever and be all over the press before the summer.
ETA: What I am saying is that this type of behavior is present in all political systems so it behooves us to keep people like Pierce out of positions of influence in politics or business.

This is awesome :)
Does this take into consideration the private verification process of Bitstamp last Fall?
--- for BitStamp
On November 22nd and 23rd, 2013 an on site due diligence was carried out in respect of Bitstamp Ltd. on behalf of a 3rd party. 
Bitstamp’s balance of BTC was validated by temporarily creating the largest single Bitcoin wallet and in the process the largest Bitcoin transaction in history.
The report identified that Bitstamp held 100% of validated BTC balance and USD funds. No material issues were raised as a consequence of the 3rd party’s investigations.

Congrats Coinninja, that is a wonderful reward!

You are simply explaining why DSN will get creepy attention. A known real name wealth manager long-time bitcoiner is as good as any ally. If the OP was anon and didn't check out, I would be more worried.

I've been slowly moving my services from GoDaddy to namecheap for years. They originally gave a huge discount to GoDaddy users after Elephant Safari Gate :) Do a google search for coupons, there are always many available. And they have a basic SSL at 10$.

I posted my resignation in the thread but made sure that Google does not associate my name with Pierce's. The story is on Buzzfeed today. Is that mainstream enough?
So many baaaaaaad awful stories will come out of the Egan vs Singer suit especially since sooooooo many people have been to these infamous parties and have stories to tell.
I have no problem setting people straight when they tell me that bitcoin is used for criminality (I mean there's a ton of witty comebacks for that) but I have no witty comeback for people who say bitcoin is a magnet for creepy con artists.

It's the catch in all of this. It is only for people who can afford to pre-pay 3 months of their own time and then, hopefully, get something in return for the effort. And that's never a guarantee. I've already invested over 6 months in studying bitcoin, I am already almost homeless because of that investment. It turns out companies in bitcoin are fly-by-night, sketchy as fuck and unbanked. I've already lost all that I could afford to lose and I have gone back to my sysadmin and dev jobs.

Fantastic movie plot but why give your enemy the credit for inventing the most transformative technology of the century? Petty vengeful people =/= selfless.

We do not need people who have a history of participating (willingly, cooperatively or not) in the victimization of people for the purpose of buying influence and making money. The fact that this happened when Pierce was 18-ish simply points ot the fact that he has turned his relationship with a convicted pedophile into various seemingly dubious business ventures. Great for him but not for us . I understand this is the modus operandi of the Vatican, European politics and Hollywood but we are trying to encourage the adoption of a technology that is supposed to be rooted in something other than war and violence. There is no 'innocent until proven guilty' situation here, we are simply talking about avoiding someone who is followed by scandal in the past (and future via the Egan vs. Singer suit). Also, his name has been removed from court documents (possibly because of his status as a victim and witness rather than as a perpetrator) means he is likely working with the FBI to gain access to important bitcoin-related information that Americans cannot obtain legally from Mt Gox. Again, great for him if he can continue to make money from shady deals but not for us. I will cancel my membership to the  Foundation shortly but I have still ordered a shit load of pop-corn for the unfolding drama and scandal that will ensue.

If you are going to start from scratch, Ethereum is a good choice.

Right now I am mostly annoyed that LTC seems to have a transaction fee that is 10 times more than BTC. BTC will become so cumbersome that it will be useless for everyday purchases and likely only used to buy cars or houses. Bitcoin will jump the shark before it is even adopted widely as a currency. That is not bad for us who have some mBTC :) LTC is the mature currency that can be used for daily transactions, unless the fee isn't adjusted. I wrote to a LTC core dev to ask about this.

Congrats Mike on the win. I look forward to seeing that in action :)

A few weeks ago, I put a 'Fuck it, we're going 100% Bitcoin!' post on Twitter LOL
Spouse and I are looking at Namibia, New Zealand, Iceland, Cyprus and a secret island I am keeping just for me :) I has taken 10 years for me to get rid of the old style economy and I started working for Bitcoins last week!
What I suggest you do is look at a list of tax shelters and work you way through them looking for money transmission regulations. For instance, in Bahamas, you can start your own bank and then, bingo :)

I think it's plain to see that the biggest growth industry right now is stealing bitcoins. I for one wouldn't want to be renowned as having any in my possession. So for this aspect alone, he may be in danger regardless of whether DSN = SN... Thank you for your offer.

Thank you very much BitcoinInfoRO :)

Joe Lauzon is the most obvious choice for this type of sponsorship because, as an I.T. professional, he is the most likely to be able to answer "Dafuq is bitcoin?" :)

I don't want to put a bitcoin node on my own server, it's built only for WordPress hosting but...
I bagged a DigitalOcean credit for 50$ from SXSW and I am wondering how long it will take for me to spend it running a node. Any idea?
