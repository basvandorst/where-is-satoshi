Yeah its called inflation/deflation. The thing every anti-fiat idiot says is the devil reborn.

Don't you understand, its like land or real estate, "god isn't making anymore" home values can only ever go up! There could never be a real estate crash, get 10 mortgages.

The ultimate irony is that it is the Federal Reserve that makes sure that fractional reserve doesn't get out of control. It is almost like they do good things.

So if money has no actual value, what are they robbing?

Yeah it isn't like "slightly less likely to happen". America has only had a 10% change over an entire YEAR 3 or 4 times since the 1920s, and the last time was the very early 1980s (Almost 40 years ago). The average has been 3.28% per year. That is if you store the money in your mattress if you offset it by something basic like a bank account it would offset that even more.

I mean you can. There are exchanges but the exchange rate right now is about $850 dollars below value. And you can only transfer like 1,000 dollars worth at a time (like .112 bitcoins). Then you will probably have some more fees for each transfer. Ohh and between 6 exchanges (the ones rated as "reliable") you can only get a total of less than $30,000 exchanged (each has a max of 250-10,022 to exchange). Then it shows up in your paypal account as like a bunch of $140 deposits, and then you will have Paypal fees. Don't forget to pay capital gains on any profit (I'm guessing on the pre exchange/pre fee amount)

That's assuming that any/much of the value of Bitcoin has anything to do with its actual usefulness as a currency.

Even if they are accepted they really are very poor for that purpose because the value isn't at all stable. You can't really do the buy some then use them right away (and what would be the point then since you could probably use the other payment option), because they take too long.

Which led (at least in America) to protections on accounts.  It would be very unlikely that someone would be held responsible for their account being hacked or manipulated. If the same thing happens with a Bitcoin you are out of luck. People have a hard enough time with online banking and remembering their password, but you expect them to keep track of much more complicated passcodes?
There is no reason I would have to eat my words, if it stabalizes in the future that doesn't change the past at all. 
Thats like saying I will eat my words if I said it was dangerous to be in Hiroshima when they dropped the atomic bomb, because now it has a really low crime rate.

I think a much simpler explanation is companies think there would be a lot of demands for more money or upset employees if they knew someone else doing the same job as you (maybe with less experience) was making more.

The difference is that you can literally be stranded because you don't have enough money. Could you imagine going to a foreign country and suddenly having like half the money you thought you would have when you landed? Lets say you already have hotel reservations and now can't afford to pay them (not that you could get a hotel room or car with just bitcoin unless you like gave them the entire value of the car or room until they could verify you didn't ruin anything).

The value of Bitcoins and Gold are also giving their worth in Fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:44:52
Explain to me how banks are a "symptom of the disease of fiat" when banks certainly existed in America before 1933 when they went off the Gold Standard. If anything led to countries moving off the gold standard it was the devastation and cost of World War I, and the paying of reparations afterward. So the Gold Standard failed completly in one of the first times a globe spanning war happened. Even though that was the exact kind of time that according to Fiat haters would say gold would be king. Instead it meant runs on not just banks, but on gold, and leaving people with gold that could no longer be easily exchanged. Of the countries that tried to go back, none of the major ones made it through the great depression with it, and it certainly would not have been able to handle WW II.
You sound like someone that blames the Jews for everything, and often when people complain about banks and fiat it is because they are literally blaming the jews for everything bad.

Such a common mistake with tech. "If it works in San Francisco it works everywhere".
Just in the last 10 hours the value has ranged between $9,021 and $10,640. So over even just that 36 hours you better have a lot of extra money in bitcoin or another payment method or you might be sleeping on the streets with no food or drink (or arrested for failure to pay).
How far in advance did you plan this? Just a month ago Bitcoin was around 6,000. So if you paid for anything just a month ahead of time suddenly you paid 50%-100% more. 
What if it was the opposite and went from 11,000 to 6,000 in a month (easily possible). Suddenly most people would have a plane ticket, but not enough money to pay for the rest of the trip.

You live in a world of fantasy, probably one where you believe that evil demon jew lizard people control the flat earth. But good job attacking instead of answering the basic question of how Banks = Fiat when Banks existed before Fiat. Because you follow no real actual logic or thought (but probably believe you are the hero of an action movie and are the one person who knows the truth).
You mean like how the Gold standard failed in the 1910s? or when it failed in the 1930s? Seems there was hyperinflation then. That was before global phone calls, let alone things like commercial air travel. To imagine it working in this globalized world is silly.
Being on the gold standard offers about 0 protection seeing as how a government can just ignore it when they want.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:03:57
In fact, if anyone is committing a fallacy it is you. Stuff is worth what it is worth at the current time, it doesn't matter what it was worth in the past, or what you paid for it. 
If you have something you could sell for $100 dollars it doesn't matter if you originally paid $10 or $200 dollars for it. 
In fact, if you bought something for $10 that you could immediately sell for $100, it effectively costs you $100 to keep it.

I mean he could also find a lottery ticket on the ground and win millions or an interdimensional gateway will open and put gold on his lap, but probably best to not show up for a vacation with the expectation that is how you are going to pay for it.

Which is ironic since that Nobel economist and others have said that Bitcoin is based on Socialist/Marxist idealism.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:59:46
No, I am not. If someone saves money for a vacation, they save up some and then go. So they board a plane and suddenly they don't have enough money because the value went down.

What bank account lost 10% of its value in the last 10 hours?

Using prepaid cards to buy gold I would guess. 
So the purchase of the gold would be mostly anonymous, and the gold itself would be near impossible to track because it can always be melted down. So two levels of protection.
Or it could be the sale of gold to someone with pre-paid cards so both sides have a level on anonymity. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:45:25
This is one of the reasons that attacking Bitcoin can only be counter-productive. If Bitcoin stops being used, a new even more anonymous system will replace it.

Bin Laden was mad because America was in the middle-east at the request of Saudi Arabia to defend middle-easterners against Iraq during Desert Storm.
This is like claiming that the US was backed by the British to fight them in the Revolutionary War because obviously UK gave money to the US beforehand.

You understand that ISIS captures the fields from companies or governments and then compete with the oil companies and governments right?
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:35:50
Bitcoin can still somewhat be tracked. If it is destroyed, a new currency which is even more anonymous will come next. Right now it can even be a way to catch criminals that have a false sense of security.
Even many government agencies know this and is one of the reasons they haven't tried too hard to fight Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:43:50
Or they just take advantage of a situation that occurred, or wait for one to push their agenda. Doesn't mean it has to be a false flag.
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:39:57
US can't even keep track of where our cash in the Middle-east is, and you expect them to have each serial number tracked?
