People need to be aware as I know a lot of people in Aust have been suckered into thinking that they have to give up personal information to buy crypto assets and that's just plain wrong. Giving no information was the point of a P2P system and now that DCEX are in operation those should be the first ones explored not places like this or coinbase etc that will retain any of your personal info and remember buy a hardware wallet and never leave your coins on ANY exchange. Not you private keys Not your coins.

Stay well away from this Digital ID!! why would you want to give a government run dept any of your financial sovereignty. Wake up Australia! decentralized exchanges exist and you just have to do some research and find the most reputable.

Australia, don't be fooled by these company's giving you the impression that because you are in Australia you need to hand over your data to Aust Post or anyone else to buy Bitcoin or any other crypto. Bitcoin is borderless and the opening of decentralized exchanges like BISQ allow you to buy anonymously as it was always intended to be. If you give up 1 shred of your personal information to these company's they can track your transaction and have a very good idea of what you own and that's not what this movement was about. Your financial sovereignty is at risk if you use these services. Do your homework, read the whitepaper and remember this was and is a peer to peer system of use.

Don't touch this or any other exchanges that are not decentralized, use a Bitcoin ATM even, might be a little more expensive but you wont be giving up your information and your financial sovereignty at the same time. Once your info is linked into a database your no longer using crypto as it was intended....... anonymously.

Im glad that day has arrived, I signed up a long time back so if anyone knows how quick on boarding and cards being sent out will take Id be grateful. Ive had the now defunct Ten X Card and that was great until it was pulled from being used and now I have the WireX car and that's very handy too. Im sure there will be more and more POS systems that come into the mainstream that you can use your wallet directly but we have to commend the efforts in helping the eco system along too. PS Im 20,700 in the cue.
