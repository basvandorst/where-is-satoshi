I don't think you know what "mathematically impossible" means. Given the numbers you quote, I also don't think you know what a trillion is.

@_date: 2015-06-28 22:49:31
... maybe there's a clue somewhere in that answer?
Bitcoin doesn't have to instantly "take over" the entire global economy. It doesn't even have to be regionally dominant. Especially not in places where internet access is a problem (though I hear there are ways around this requirement, such as SMS-based solutions).
The way I see it, the entire premise of your question (that everyone on the planet needs access for bitcoin to work) is deeply flawed.

@_date: 2015-06-19 00:15:29
Let me put it this way. I don't think you keeping your money in a greek bank will save greece's banking system. I also don't think a banking crisis will "destroy Greece". 
So yes. I suppose I would pull my cash. But I would probably want a resolution at this time. As I said, I essentially think a crisis in unavoidable. Now it's a question of timing. You will have available cash while the ECB keeps providing liquidity. Once that spigot turns off, I don't think any amount of "patriotism" will help.
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:32:45
RemindMe! 100 days "Greek banks still OK? Bet lost."
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:16:53
Actually, you (just like me) don't know what is "best" to hold. Bitcoin may be "riskier", this is not the same thing as "worse".
@_date: 2015-06-19 11:44:30
I would argue that we currently do not have an "efficient use of capital" in our current system. Manipulated interest rates and manipulated markets have created enormous malinvestments that we're going to have to correct in years, maybe decades, to come.
I'm not speaking for "the community", but personally I'm not against banks. Or loans. But I'm very much against tax-payer funded deposit guarantees and loan guarantees.
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:49:24
Well... Yes. But ignoring the problem doesn't solve it, it just lets it grow bigger for a little while before the shit *really* hits the fan.
Of course, the more you lose, the less someone else has to. Presumably. But calling that "patriotism" seems a bit... odd... I'm pretty sure the extra cash won't be fairly or responsibly managed. Best case scenario it won't be essentially stolen.
But hey. If you don't need that money and feel that the greek banks or the greek government need it more then by all means. Just don't be surprised and/or upset when it actually happens.
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:27:15

@_date: 2015-06-28 22:17:21
That's not the point. Bitcoin does a lot for those (admittedly few) Greeks that did adopt it. It's not about "saving Greece". It's not even about avoiding losses (that boat likely just sailed). Right now, it's about learning from the mistakes that have been made. Regular people in Spain (etc) still have a chance.
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:36:54
Agree about Greece. They have had *years* to get out, now it's looking as if it's too late to avoid the first blow. Of course, it might still be a good idea to look for a way out. If possible.
As for "all other nations using the Euro"... I very much doubt we'll see "contagion" enough to limit BTC purchases within a week. Of course, if things really unravel you never know. I'd be looking for the exits...
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:58:09
How anyone can keep more money than absolutely necessary in a greek bank at this time is completely beyond me. The way I see it, it is virtually a certainty that there will be capital controls and/or deposit confiscation in the near future.
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:34:30
I don't know... Bitcoin is tiny, and even (given the context) a small inflow would significantly impact the bitcoin side. Also, consider that speculation from non-greeks is likely to amplify any nontrivial adoption in a crisis scenario.
I don't think that bitcoin will significantly impact greece. Yet. This is not to say that greece cannot significantly impact bitcoin (or those who use it).
@_date: 2015-06-19 11:46:44
Indeed they are. This particular trainwreck has been in progress for several years, though. I think it's fair to say that everyone has had plenty of opportunity to get out by now.
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:08:35
I suppose. I don't really like to gamble, and I'm exceptionally bad at timing. But for a 1:1 bet (or say of $50), how much time would I get for my "near future" prediction? Before the end of september?

This party just never ends. "We're now expecting to propose a final final deal the day after the last deadline ever (ignore the last last deadline), just in time to extend the date of the last payment to avoid a default..."
Just get it over with already. Everyone knows this is unsustainable. Every day they keep this going just makes the final cost higher. Primarily for the german taxpayer...
It's time to cut your losses and see what can be salvaged. Throwing more money at Greece's government is insane, even if you persist in calling it a "loan".

Are YOU just conveniently forgetting about the huge amount of crime that regular banks are associated with? Hint: I's several orders of magnitude larger than the entire bitcoin economy. What safeguards are in place that this doesn't happen? Hint: It happens. Safeguards doesn't work. What about state confiscation of deposits? Runaway inflation? These problems are unlikely to become more rare in the coming years.
You're just as delusional - you're just in another cult.
@_date: 2014-08-17 23:13:12
I agree: It's kind of like how various other fiat currencies around the world undermine the USD.
On a serious note, though... Some people see altcoins as a problem. Imho these people have simply not thought things through properly. Insofar as this prevents them from investing in bitcoin, this is a "real" problem - but I suspect this won't matter much in the grand scheme of things.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:11:45
Yes, but then the "days" are destroyed, as the name implies. As a metric it is interesting, but very hard to interpret.
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:59:00
Forgive me, but how does this not contradict your previous comment? :) Sure, the picture does not in itself prove that greek banks are in trouble - but calling it (the original post) "clueless speculation and fud" might as well be stating that greek banks are fine. Don't you think?
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:19:17

@_date: 2014-05-23 15:32:21
Let's not forget the obvious answer: people around the world can affoard to lose a LOT more than $5bn. At least several orders of magnitude more.
Note that "can affoard to lose" and "want to throw away" are not the same thing. Bitcoin is a high risk, high reward investment atm.
I regularly invest 10-20% of my (admittedly currently not that big) income in btc. Would a crash be an economic setback? Yes. Can I afford it? Yes.
Also note that many people risk WAY MORE than they can (at least comfortably) afford to lose in housing bubbles, for instance. They just don't see it.

All economic models have "problems" if you consider options such as "housing prices will decline" as a problem. :) I humbly suggest you reconsider this assumption.
On a related note, isn't it amazing that somehow we've been told that "affordable housing" is best achieved by making sure the prices of homes keep rising?
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:41:41
The secret is aligning incentives. For bitcoin to become widespread, the price will have to go up - thus you can be BOTH enthusiatic about bitcoin adoption AND hope for an increase in price.
In fact, claiming to hope for one without the other is either ignorant or disingenuous.
@_date: 2014-10-13 00:01:12
Aren't you just a ray of sunshine? :)
Not everyone can "spend their efforts improving crypto" and "get rid of it's defects", but are better of doing what they can and supporting it in other ways. Such as by buying bitcoin, investing or spreading the word (to name just a few ideas).
What else... ? Prise *is* important, both for perception and economics, but perhaps not as much as many think (in the short term).
And... There are no weird libertarian politics. There are only weird statist politics.

@_date: 2014-01-17 17:01:18
If they wanted to, they can buy all the BTC that are *for sale*. This is nowhere near "all the BTC". Also, in the process of doing so, they would drive the price sky high - not unlikely ruining their own paper in the process.
I say give it a shot. ;) I'd love to see how my BTC (not currently for sale) would fare.

Have you saved for long, and would it be difficult to replace if lost? "Life savings" is kind of a meaningless label if you don't save much. ;)
You know your tolerance for risk better than anyone else. Generally, though, cashing out at break-even makes the investment one-sided to the bad side. If you can't stomach the risk, I'd cash out (as much as you feel the need to) without waiting.

Nice picking of intervals. Why didn't you include december, too? That would make your argument even stronger...
Let's try an alternative (equally irrelevant) observation:
Since Jan 1 2012, the USD has lost over 95% of it's value as compared to BTC. Inflation rate in actual hyperinflation territory. Dollar collapse imminent.
See what I did there? One date changed, completely different conclusion. Maybe there is something wrong with this methodology?
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:53:25
How is this bitcoin specific? If you buy 200 shares of AAPL, could those not have beloned to warlords or slave handlers?
Also... "The market cap was mined illegally by criminals and it is now being distributed to you by those same criminals when you purchase BitCoin. We are buying stolen currency from salespeople involved in horrific crimes against children and other vulnerable people."
Really? You base this on what data, exactly? And again, how does this differ from say the euro? I hear there are criminals that use the euro. If you buy euro with dollars, are you not funding these people with dollars?
TLDR; I don't think you really made sense there...

Since the bitcoin price is rather easy to push, I have no problem seeing either news "causing" the move. If I had money available in an exchange I'd be more inclined to buy on worries of war than on NY regulations - in part because I don't know if the NY regulations will have a positive or negative impact on the price.

Careful with the hyperbole. This is like saying you should never invest before carefully researching everything beforehand. It may be good advice, but I doubt I'm alone in not doing so.
Don't take stupid risks. I'll agree to that. But the angry ranting would do well to stay back well before "EVERYTHING" and "YOU DESERVE TO NOT HAVE ANY BITCOIN". ;)
On a sidenote this always annoys me with the Let's talk Bitcoin disclaimer intro also. Even though I know it's tounge-in-cheek, I suspect it scares a lot of potential newcomers from making a reasonable bet and getting their feet wet. Plenty of people seem to think bitcoin is somehow much more dangerous and risky than say roulette - which most reasonable individuals understand is risky, but nothing you necessarily must stay out of (!!!).

Not saying they are connected here, but... Is it really that hard? Gold tends to immediately spike on geopolitical events. Likely so also today, see i.e.

1. You would need to use a confirmed TX to to a hot wallet, I assume. Kinda like you carry cash or a credit card (typically with a limit) for daily use.
2. True. But generally the delay is an issue for small purchases. Your new computer or car can wait for confirmation (or you fund your hot wallet before shopping for your new computer).
3. I suppose there would be many? I would trust almost any known company to verify doublespends if I was a vendor. Bitpay, Coinbase, Paypal, Google, Apple or Walmart. Whoever. I'm guessing the payment gateways would keep lists.

I'm gonna stick my neck out here: I think it is going to "blast off" again, but timing markets is tricky business. My personal strategy is gradual accumulation. If this thing works, I think we'll see huge price increases. If it doesn't... Well... At least I'll have put my money into something I believe in, and that could have made a huge difference.

I for one am sick of the volatility discussion. Locality is not a predictor of volatility - size is. Smaller currencies are generally more volatile.

The point still holds, though. Being a goldbug he doesn't necessarily hold much dollars either.
The point is if you want say a box of silver coins, you can do so with relative ease with dollars. And with bitcoin. I figure you'll have quite a bit more hoops to jump through if you want to pay for them with gold coins.
In other words, in practice, bitcoin is much better suited as a transactional medium than gold. And mr. Shiff agrees. "Actions speak louder than words", and all...

Well, no. I would argue, however, that suitability for executing transactions is perhaps the most important characteristic of money. We use it to facilitate commerce.

This seems like an easier solution (to make happen), but unless I'm missing something it's actually less secure (in the same was that "only" one confirmation is less secure than two). No?

I would still assert that it is less secure, though - and potentially vulnerable to a cybil attack (or just dumb luck if the miner who happens to mine the next block is one you didn't check with and who got the double spend). I have no idea just how likely or unlikely this is to work if you try it, but considering that it's essentially free to try it could still be a problem.

I would suggest bitcoin is highly volatile due to ongoing adoption and speculation. Both of which are necessary for bitcoin to become widespread, liquid and usable.

I suspect you might want to consider the following quick points, though.
1. You don't "have to" use a bank when using bitcoin as when using regular fiat money. In fact, you're probably regularly told not to trust anyone with your private keys, since you can't trust people with your money (see i.e. your example above ;)).
2. There is no bail-out or bail-in mechanisms. When the above mentioned "Bitcoin bank" experiences a run, it will promptly go belly-up, and the depositors will loose their money - thus reinforcing people not to trust others with their money (see  above).
I'm sure there are more relevant observations, but I'm not here to find them all. ;)

Not even close to 13M. As in orders of magnitude away from. Of course, if they put $1T in, the price could potentially shoot up to say $1M only to then drop back down, so there's no saying what volumes would be swallowed by such a purchase, or there the price would land afterwards. We can be sure that the trading price would temporarily reach MUCH HIGHER than 75kUSD, though.

Let me give you a simplified answer that ignores the layers upon layers of unknown complexity that real-life markets provide.
Imagine you are a miner. Your essential business decision (as it relates to the bitcoin price) is if you should sell your BTC and invest in more hardware or not. IF you can mine profitably (as measured in BTC), the answer to this question is "yes", you should sell BTC and buy mining hardware, since this will increase your BTC holdings over time.
As the date of the reward halving approaches, this calculation changes. The amount of BTC you can expect to recoup from an investment in mining hardware shrinks more the closer you get to the date. In particular, after the halving, the expected return is likely to be significantly lower. This shifts the equilibrium incentive of selling BTC and buying hardware upwards (towards a more expensive BTC). Over time, the mining collective will optimize investment (and thus selling pressure) of BTC to the new reward size.
In other words: to a large degree, *it's about the flow, not the stock*.

Although I appreciate the sentiment it might be wise not to consider your BTC investments as "safe". In my mind bitcoin is still a high risk/high reward proposition. If you want safety you should diversify.

@_date: 2014-12-04 10:03:54
Very few (if any) can understand what's going on, and, more importantly, what will go on in the future.
I can throw two theories in to give you som possibilities to explore:
1.) "Deflationary forces" are still in play that have had a bigger impact than the money-printing. For instance, large financial institutions that to a large extent received the new money simply keep it as a buffer, and so it hasn't made it's way into the "real" economy yet.
2.) Globalization and reserve currency mechanics in uncertain times: again, as (relative) "perceived safety", the dollar is "exported", thus increasing currency in circulation in countries other than the US. When these dollars are saved, this has (more than) two effects in the US: currency in circulation is diminished (deflationary) and goods come in from these countries in exchange for the dollars (deflationary).
In the receiving country, the effects are often the opposite. Thus inflation (paradoxically) typically often shows up around the world, particularly in weak economies, when new dollars are printed.
I can't get my mind around these mechanics myself (few can), but if you start looking, you can find ways that *might* explain apparent contradictions easily.
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:00:05
I find this assertion very 20th century. The world is changing, and in no small part, bitcoin is making it happen.

I have no idea - but what you describe actually doesn't necessarily sound odd.
First off, cooperatives and non-app-stores... This is necessary since Apple does not allow bitcoin apps on the app store. This is the alternative way to distribute apps to an iPhone.
Second, "building your wallet" should include collecting entropy for generating keys, as well as some acutal compulational work. I have no idea of what is reasonable, but if it picks unlucky numbers, I suppose a nontrivial delay is possible.
Finally - if they wanted to harvest data from your device, they'd probably do so without locking it. There's nothing stopping them from doing whatever they may (which may or may not be much given the iPhone sandboxing - I'm not an expert), while you're actually using the app. Locking it doesn't help them at all.
As for tips... If you don't trust them, do not trust them with much bitcoin. Keep a low balance in the app.

Say I have my funds in the "hot wallet" described above, and I cannot spend it without third-party verification for another three days (three days is just me picking numbers from nowhere, but as an example) this would assure the buyer that a double spend could not happen in three days - even if it has not yet been accepted into the blockchain.
In other words, if the seller trusts the verifier - he wouldn't need to check network propagation or blockchain inclusion.

I don't know... Google is likely one of the companies best positioned to profit greatly from bitcoin adoption - especially from the developing world. You hear them talk quite a lot about "the next three billion" to connect to the internet. I imagine these people will be worth more to service providers and the internet economy (and thus as potential ad-consumers) if they have a means to transact globally.

I distinguish the two by future expectations. I don't think most (at least I don't) expect stable prices going forward. The bears expect a crash, the bulls expects a rally. Only a minority expects the price to remain near todays level.
So what we have is, in a sense, actual price stability. But since expectations doesn't match, the possible advantages of "stability" doesn't materialize.
In my humble opinion. ;)

Well, yes. But this is true of every new technology before it is widely adopted. First we need to get it to work, then we need to get it adopted for some significant use case - then, and only then, will it have a significant impact on the real economy.
The current "negative contribution" is actually in a very real sense not consumption, but an investment (as seen from a collective perspective) - both in security, but significantly also as a means of fairly distributing the new coins. Note that this last problem is nontrivial in itself, and probably borderline impossible without "wasting" value close to the current market value of the coins.
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:45:07
Not valid. It presupposes that real value is not being created - in other words that "economic activity" is a zero sum game. In the general case this is clearly false, and I'd argue (strongly) that it is also false in the case of bitcoin.

Yes and no... 
I think this will help a fair number of people get exposure to bitcoin who are not willing to learn about the tech.
I do not, however, think "traditional investors" are as eager to jump in as we would all hope. Maybe if the price was rising, there would be a sense of urgency. Then again, maybe not.
Patience really is a virtue. ;)

Aren't you the optimist? Every exchange/wallet either stals or gets hacked? This is not my experience - and odds are things will get better rather than worse going forward.

Importantly: make sure you can live with your investment(s) without constantly worrying about it. If you worry or feel bad - pull back.
That said, I've reasoned similarly. The pension systems are likely to be long gone before I retire (or at least sufficiently devalued so as to no be worth much). The stock markets look significantly overvalued. Fiat currencies are being "printed" like it's going out of fashion... At least in bitcoin I can support a worthy cause and simultaneously have a shot at a great return.
It's often repeated that bitcoin is only worth something when people have faith in it. Guess what - this is what faith looks like. Right or wrong. I respect that.
And good luck. :)

With a 120 year horizon, I'll bet you just about anything that bitcoin will be vastly less inflationary than any fiat currency currently on the planet.

Just remember that security and ease of use is typically a tradeoff, and for many users it's not worth it to learn and apply security best practices (if only because the amounts involved are small).
Also, remember that storing your private keys locally on your computer is not in itself to be considered "safe". Keep it unecrypted and you're just a malware attack from being robbed yourself with no one to refund the hack.

Makes no sense. You also need to consider the *price* of the coins, not just the number.
50BTC/hour at say 1USD is quite a lot less than 25BTC/hour at 270USD.

Or, if I might add something: make a smaller investment. If you can manage a 60% drop on an investment of size X, chances are you're about as comfortable with a 100% loss on an investment of size 0.6X. 
I suggest investing only about as much as you're comfortable losing.

I have shown this to a few friends who are not into bitcoin at the moment, who are now likely to get at least some small exposure. For people who are not "into bitcoin" like some of us here, they don't really feel the rush the same way. I would actually be a bit surprised if large amounts of "new" money entered straight away.
The best we can hope for, I think, is a slow but steady new inflow of capital from "regular people" who wants bandwagon insurance... ;)
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:00:13
How about this for a reason? "Bitcoin isn't currently plummeting in value." Not good enough? Then before you try cherrypicking some bad interval for the BTC rate, remember that this last plunge hasn't been the only one. In fact, the "official" exchange rate is still (accoring to google) 6.35.
If you want to make a short btc/long vef bet, I'd gladly take the other side. Just let me know.

Yeah. "There's a lot of misinformation and chicanery" in bitcoin? Which "mimics all the terrible qualities of the gold standard"...
Well. I suppose the first part is true, just no more than for any other form of money. And the other is mostly true also, only those "terrible qualities", one can argue, are actually sorely needed.

Speaking as a libertarian/anarchist programmer who buys bitcoin for both political and investment purposes, I can safely state that the conclusion reflected in the headline is false.
No science needed.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:14:51
It seems likely that the miners are net sellers of bitcoin to some significant portion of newly minted coins (at least for the miners who reinvest in mining equipment with an expected ROI that's above holding bitcoin). How large this portion is I can't say.
However... I don't really think it's that important who takes on the risk. If the miners hold the bitcoin (after having converted fiat to btc), the effect is essentially the same - only the "purchase" is implicit from the coinbase tx.
Bottom line is, *someone* is (currently) willing to take on an additional $1M per day in btc exposure.

Huh? Also, did you notice how the link is to this think called "youtube", which does not handle bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:54:31
Now wait a second... Even if we give the "BND" a well defined defintion (say "the total purchase price of all outstanding bitcoin, as paid by their current holders"), how does this reflect expectations of future investments?
Whether I bought bitcoin at $1 or $1000, if I'm holding now, this means I value bitcoin at or above $272, no? What difference does my purchase price make?
Given the highly speculative nature of bitcoin (as stated), I don't think amount invested is a reasonable measure for expected outcome. For instance, let's assume I personally think bitcoin has a risk weighted value of $1000 right now (if, for some reason, I think it'll be valued say $10000 in two years with an 8% chance, for instance). This doesn't mean I can keep buying bitcoin until the price hits $1000. And even if I could, I may not want to place that big a bet. In this example, I fully expect future investments to a much larger degree than "the market" does. Now, to bring this back to BND - what difference does it make if I bought my current stack at $1 or $1000?
I'll grant you that the "BND" is an interesting number. Or it would be if we could find it. ;) But I'm not sure I see how it really relates to expectations. I do see how market cap relates to expectations, though, since it directly correlates with the current market price.

I disagree.
Voting can, and does, hurt. Why? Because it legitimizes the political process, which, as was stated above, is a corrupt system. Besides, there's rarely a chance for regular people to vote for any meaningful "good" - they can support red or blue politicians. And sometimes they can vote for real issues and be subsequently ignored (if only I could think of a recent example...).
Engaging in the act help maintain the illusion. Just stop it.

"Money laundering" might be illegal for quite a while, but this doesn't mean there won't be ways to change in and out of currencies or assets that can be easily exchanged.

Actually that's exactly what it means. You are correct in that it implies that there is liquidity at the current price. However, since the stock is increasing while the price holds, this means, by definition, that the market cap is increasing accordingly.

Because think the "volatility" argument has been overused. I firmly believe that bitcoin, over the long term, is going up. This makes it an attractive store of value. Short to medium term "volatility" doesn't matter if you have this perspective.
Add to this that it's attractiveness as a store of value is relative to the available alternatives. The more crises that we see in other currencies and in the financial system, the more I think bitcoin will appear "safe" in spite of volatility.
I'm well aware that bitcoin is a big risk at the time. However, so is keeping money in banks (since almost all banks are insolvent). And in the stock markets (since they're highly valued and can crash -- see China for the last three weeks for an example). And in bonds - since we have interest rates at historical lows, making quite possibly the greatest bond bubble in world history.
And I know of no other asset with the potential upside of bitcoin: In the current environment, the prudent thing to do is to diversify. If just a relative few diversify from stocks and bonds and into bitcoin, it will make for quite a rise in the price.
But we'll see.

This depends on how you sell. If you can find a buyer, it's between you and him/her. Try to sell on a market, and the price would plummet "in the process" of your sell. As little as a few thousand bitcoin typically noticably affect the price, at least temporarily, so to sell 1MBTC, you'd need to sell it over a long time to avoid taking the price down well below current levels. A 1MBTC sell order on any exchange would take out all buy orders, and any buyers would pick the remainder up for virtually nothing (I assume).
For instance. On Bitstamp, you could sell about 15kBTC for a total of less than 3MUSD (in the process driving the price to $0.03). At Bitfinex 25kBTC for 5MUSD. Of course, at sufficiently low prices, someone would step in and buy all you could sell, and the price would hopefully recover.
... so if you have 1,000,000 BTC to unload. Stay away from the exchanges. ;)

Wait a second -- *GOLD* didn't fail. Previous gold standard systems failed. These are not interchangable.
@_date: 2015-07-03 20:06:06
In case you forgot, they have capital controls in place, and can only withdraw up to EUR 50 a day (really 60, but they're out of EUR 20 notes, if I got that right).
That's a lot of "leisurely" standing in line if you have nontrivial amounts to save. Also, it requires "not immediately" to be a long time away.
@_date: 2015-07-05 23:01:01
Why not? Had we actually traded *gold* in the past, this could well have worked out just fine. We didn't.
Also, if you actually have the gold (as in the physical commodity, not a defunct paper claim), it still has a lot of value. Much more than any fiat currency once tied to it (over the long term - I'm painfully aware of the poor performance during the last few years).

@_date: 2015-07-05 14:14:18
Math looks fine (not that I really checked, but I see no obvious mistakes), but the interpretation is off.
At this stage, the mining is primarily a distribution mechanism. The (approximate, temporary) equilibrium between miner's expenses and the market price of bitcoin is what makes the process somewhat "fair". (Miners aren't "given" bitcoin, they have to earn them).
The fact that this distribution mechanism also serves as an incentive to secure the network is part of the brilliance of the design, since it means we can achieve a much higher level of security *without* incurring the "costs".
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:38:02
I'd suggest this cannot be calculated at all, and depends to a large extent on how bitcoin is used.
I personally think bitcoin will shine as a store of value before it will be widely adopted as a transactional currency - and I see no reason, if this is true, that it would stop being used as a store of value once transaction volume picks up.
My preferred method is comparison to other asset classes or currencies.
For instance. For bitcoin to match gold or the USD, we'd need a valuation at about 500-3000 times todays value (don't quote me on this, I'm just going off memory here). This could give a baseline for an optimistic scenario. 
If we have a crisis of faith in fiat and gold does not reassert it's role as monetary base (deferring to bitcoin) AND if bitcoin becomes a transactional medium of choice (this is the "nirvana scenario" ;)), then the best method is looking at amount of bitcoin divided by population. Equally distributed over the entire earth's population, every human would have about 0,003 bitcoin, so imagine if the average liquidity and savings on earth were 0,003 bitcoin. I'll just note that "to the moon" and "astronomical" are appropriate in this context. ;)
@_date: 2015-07-03 20:38:33

I don't accept your premise. We don't use fiat because it's inflationary - we use fiat because it is convenient. The fact that it looses it's value is a negative for any holder.

Then we'll disagree to the end. I would suggest that precisely this ability of the Fed (or any central bank) to adjust money supply and/or interest rates is precisely what has caused the global financial system to become unsustainable. Monetary interventions can "help" in the short term, but at the cost of building up longer term consequences and risks.

I don't think there are many low risk stocks at the present time at all. Markets have been propped up by QE for years. Financial institutions, countries, corporations *and* individuals have all borrowed heavilly all over the world.
It wouldn't surprise me at all if we see a broad stock market collapse this fall, with "low risk" stocks down 25-50%. (Of course, it wouldn't surprise me if we were to stay in our current limbo for another year or two either; point is I think there are significant risks).

How could you possibly know what progress would have been made if not for the fiat money system?
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:00:45
I'll never understand this position. It literally makes no sense to me. 
Sure I'd sell if I really needed the money. However, why sell just because you anticipate you're going to sell anyway if you believe in the tech? And why "get out" at all? As suggested elsewhere in this thread: why not just at least stick a bitcoin in a paper wallet and hide it in your safety deposit box? Would that be too stressful over the coming 15 years? :P

Just be careful not to introduce incentives for miners to spam transactions themselves.
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:04:58
My advice: don't even try with the timing. My experience is that (short term) the price typically moves against any trades I make.
If you have 6kEUR to invest, I'd buy a first tranche right away, and once you feel comfortable, spread the rest of the buys out by however much you feel comfortable with.

Also if we tried, and attempted to sell €2bn worth of bitcoins, the price would take quite a hit. ;) At the time, I don't think we could realistically raise even 10% of that (even if we could somehow get all the bitcoins for this cause).

You must be confused. Spending != creating.
@_date: 2015-04-30 23:33:58
I actually think this is not too far from the realistic best-case scenario. The reason why no state backed alternative can (I hope) really replace bitcoin is because of the rivalry between the global actors. Not that the russians are all "Tay bitcoin" now, but I can't imagine them being "Yay, USD crypto!".
Bitcoin may not answer up to most peoples wishes, but it's neutral in a way that no initiative with a strong backer can be.
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:06:56
True. I guess I was really thinking more of apperances. The US has been highly regarded in recent history, but has mostly lost this privilege during the last few decades.

There's only one (1) possible explanation for this: Lagarde is secretly into bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:30:15
Doesn't this kind of analysis confuse available stock with required flow to facilitate a transfer?
If we want to invest 30 billion USD into bitcoin, we cannot derive a price by simply dividing 30B with the number of bitcoins, since this would assume that everyone is willing to sell. At the same price. This seems... "somewhat" unlikely.
I would suggest there is no way to invest that much into bitcoin in any reasonably short period of time, and attempting anything close to it would drive the price sky high. Of course, if suddently the bitcoin bug evolved and became contagious to the larger population, I suppose there is a chance this *would* indeed happen, and that would push the price insanely high. Once large movements have been completed, the price will again settle on a new supply/demand level - meaning that the price would settle based on what the remaining demand would support.
An interesting note, though, is that is "the Internet" attempted to invest 30B into bitcoin, current holders(*) would have to SELL bitcoin for 30B USD out of the existing stock. Those would be fun days. ;)
@_date: 2015-04-30 23:35:44

How was it... ? "Obvious troll is obvious"?
@_date: 2015-03-06 01:16:54
This is the real question, isn't it? And this *should* be a lesson for the rest of the world that has yet to enter the real crisis. Once there are capital controls and the governments biggest task is to hide the fact that you're in hyperinflation, getting out of (this kind of) fiat is "a little" late...
What was this? Episode 57 of hyperinflation in modern times? And still people have faith to rival the jihadis about how sound their money is - even though they *know* it's managed by politicians (who *everyone* by now knows lie for a living) and bankers (who live by conjuring money from the air).
It amazes me how slow the process is toward the inevitable.
@_date: 2015-11-07 11:33:20
I disagree. The stance that BIP 101 makes it an altcoin, which in turn makes it "not up for debate" (to be generous with the language) is, imho, clearly wrong.
I am, for my part, strongly considering leaving r/bitcoin until this policy of cencorship of oppinions is reversed. Difficult questions needs to be aired and discussed, not decided upon by forum moderators.
@_date: 2015-03-06 02:33:59
Anyone planning to live off a state pension is a huge optimist. Either they believe the states will somehow manage their economies (highly unlikely), or they believe we'll see technological progress that will allow a comfortable existence without managed state economies (somewhat more likely, imho).

Don't know. It shows an increase in investment, that's for sure. However, I can't help but think that a few "super rich" with "huge trust" would make more than a dent in the price (to the upside).

I "like" your style. You quote me saying that facts and fears are different things, and then you reiterate your fear, stating that it is fact.
You cannot summon facts at will. Saying "this is fact, this is fact" over and over again does not a fact make.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:23:03
Agree. Though the starving part is dependent on the state actually staying in control. I used to think that was a given, but I'm not so sure any more. Things are changing fast, and 35 years is a long time.
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:02:12
When comparing predictions, always use log-scale (relative, percentage based, whatever you prefer) values. Mr. Bitcorn's $10 prediction is 25x off - basically as bad as a $6250 prediction. Plus he had a date on his prediction.
Sure, maybe you can find a few bullish predictions that bad, but he's way up there for sure.
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:36:55
Becuase absolute distance between the forecast and the actual price is always greater the higher the number, so what you want is to see how far off in relative terms the two prices are.
My original post hints at the process. The difference between $10 and $250 is 25x. The difference between $250 and $6250 is also 25x, so "$10 is to $250" as "$250 is to $6250".
An extreme example also always further makes the point:
If I were to guess at the price a year from now, and I say $100, most would probably say this was a good estimate if we happen to arrive at somewhere in that general area. Say $80 to $125.
If I guess $1000000, we would similarly agree that the estimate was good if the price turns out to be between $800000 and $1250000.
Notice that there's a $250000 difference in the second case. This is "ok" in the second case since the amount is so big. We can't from this conclude that a $250000 difference is ok regardless of the size of the prediction -- which is self-evident in the example: a prediction of $100 and a final price of $250100 would be unbelievably bad.
The "logarithmic" part is just the formalization of this phenomenon.
@_date: 2015-03-08 03:49:48
Must be. Makes perfect sense. I know I refuse to drive. Do you have any idea how much money they made?
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:19:46
Not any more. Have a look at price correlation between stocks in the last few years and tell me you're "diversified" with a typical selection of stocks.
Naturally there are exceptions, but the financialization of our economy has created correlations where there should be none - it all ties back to credit creation and related tail risks.

There's a funny thing about the position that bitcoin is bad because it is deflationary... If true, it means you SHOULD BUY BITCOIN! The fact that it can be branded a reason not to get it is... I'll refrain from selecting an actual word here...
Yes, yes. I know some people hold that money should not be deflationary for the "good of the economy" or some such. This does not change the fact that it would be the rational choice for the individual.
Even more amusing is when you combine this line or argumentation with the one presented by OP. "I didn't buy because it would rise in value, and now I don't have any - which is unfair!"
@_date: 2015-03-30 18:45:16
Wait, what?
The hash rate rises as long as it's profitable to mine bitcoin. Wasn't this exactly what we expected?
Also, if there are many cash-strapped miners that are desperate to get out of BTC, how come they aren't selling (more) right now?
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:32:04
Look. Moonrun. The fact that you can dream up scenarios doesn't make them facts. Facts and fears are different things.
Now, I'd love to talk you over with how unlikely it is that bitcoin will first succeed, and then fail as per your comment, but since you're obviously locked in for the time I don't see a reason to. Suffice to say I don't share your concerns. I do, however, have several other concerns about the morality of our present monetary systems. I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you're not particularly interested in those? Even if I claim you're being immoral for promoting their relative virtues? ;)
@_date: 2015-03-07 00:57:28

@_date: 2015-03-08 04:06:58
What do you mean by "by-and-large"?
I've met a lot of people who thinks bitcoin is a risky bet, and because of it refuse to take any position. To me this makes no sense at all - if a bet is risky (but with a high enough expected return to warrant the risk), the rational response is to be small - not to stay away. Unless the only acceptable bet is so small so as not to be worth the hassle.
@_date: 2015-03-08 05:28:29
Look at the history of fiat currency and you'll conclude they're all going to zero.
The fact is that there is, in essence, no "history" of cryptocurrencies. Especially not of comparatively well established cryptocurrencies (as is relevant with the by far dominant one).
And again: "This is fact"? Really? Considering our exchange above one would imagine you could at least try another parroting exercise to provide weight to your argument?
Oh. Wait. You did! "This is undeniable". No. It isn't. I deny it. See above.
Good night.

So... The content of the article is better than it's headline.
TL;DR: Opening kiosks and mimicking a traditional remittance business is expensive. Regulations. Rents. Lots of work. "The last mile" issue is still very expensive when dealing with fiat-fiat (using bitcoin only behind the scenes). 
Cheap settlement is not enough to become competitive with established players.
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:37:41
Actually, I'd argue that bitcoin is competition. Sure: Visa, MC and Amex dominates right now, but that doesn't mean they will forever. Lots of new entrants popping up at the moment.
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:05:26
The beautiful thing about this piece is that is assumes that the current financial system is without risk. If capital controls and/or deposit confiscation occurs, it basically reads "bitcoin is the best thing ever".
Now, I dare you to tell anyone in Greece that banks are safe and still go to sleep without thinking you've made this someone a great disservice. And I very much doubt it will be long before "contagion" makes this more than a local matter.
Anyone with serious wealth who is not hedging a collapse in the current financial system is, imho, grossly irresponsible.

Hey, all my "predictions" are theories (and not really mine, at that) - not facts. My point is that there is a high probability that different stocks are not "diversification" in the sense that it avoids risk.
My meager assets are primarily in cash, gold, silver and bitcoin in anticipation for a currency/market crash. I've been wrongly waiting for this for several years, though... We'll see.
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:44:35
Sure seems they've got this all figured out, doesn't it?
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:16:47
Get used to it. Or just zoom the chart out a bit and enjoy the ride. With a 24h gain of about 25%, calling the crash seems a bit... premature? ;)
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:11:30
That's part of it, but it doesn't explain anywhere near the present levels of correlation (especially considering that commodities, for instance, do not correlate as well).
The markets are all tied together. I think it's likely we'll face a more or less world-wide stock market crash in the near future. Being "diversified" in stocks in such a scenario is pretty uncomfortable.
@_date: 2015-02-20 14:55:31
Short answer: Don't worry. It will never (and I mean *never*) become *that* popular.
@_date: 2015-03-08 03:59:00
This is not a fact. No one - even early adopters - know how much the bitcoin economy can absorb or how fast it can recover from a crash cause by selling.
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:03:45
A lack of knowledge is a rational argument. Truth is we (I include you here, assuming you don't have special knowledge the rest of us are missing) simply do not know how this will turn out. Thus the future is uncertain.
I'm very optimistic about bitcoin's prospects, but I won't claim to know.
About the "millions or zero" bit, I agree. That statement is very much more specific, and way harder to motivate by simple uncertainty. Why can't bitcoin stay at present (within one or two orders of magnitude)? Beats me. It just doesn't match the happy scenario. ;)

I think the main point here is that the 3% fines from CC transactions are not entirely profit. From what I've heard, a significant part is used for fraud management, and another significant part is probably bonus programs and incentive programs (I have a CC with a 1% cashback - I'm betting this won't be possible with a 0.2% fee limit).
Regulation can nudge things to where they're going faster - they cannot change the underlying reality.

No. But to avoid splitting hairs even worse than yours let's just assume you meant the quoted passage, or even the first two paragraphs. This still doesn't change that the content of the article, of which I got the distinct impression that "you're responsible" isn't going to fly in todays world - thus bitcoin will fail.
I guess you read something else? Perhaps something about the "effete rebellion"? I don't know. Frankly I don't much care. My point was that his arguments against bitcoin, in essense, assumes that the traditional financial system is without risk.
@_date: 2015-03-06 02:29:38

You're right, of course, but are these "features" we really need at this stage? If you want to borrow money for a car, perhaps bitcoin isn't the ideal vehicle (pun not intended). Neither if you want to sign a lease.
We should first establish value. Stability without value is even more useless than value without stability.
This is also why I believe speculation is beneficial. It drives price, thus enabling the greater economy to establish itself. Volatility is the price we pay, and I can't see how it could be avoided.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:52:47
Nice analogy. So saying that the electricty and computing power is wasted on bitcoin is kinda like saying that oil is wasted on cars and other contraptions.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:33:40
Not at all! The blockchain provides a service that most thought impossible only a few short years back - one that could potentially end up saving us several trillion (USD equivalents) every year (these are resources - some of which are "electricity and computing power" - now used in the legacy system).
The electricity and power used to power the bitcoin network are, imho, well spent. And the computing power is NOT wasted - this is what makes it all possible and secure. We're simply not seeing the savings or possibilities yet.
