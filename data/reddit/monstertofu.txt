The counter-argument is basically that these predictions of failure have actually been made about every technology, innovative or not. 
 Essentially every time there is a roadblock there are way more naysayers than optimists, because it is easier to lack imagination than to have it, to say something will never work than sit down and try hard to make it work.
People actually claimed that large files were gonna kill the Internet (first through Usenet and then through large email attachments).  They said shit like how can the Internet handle so many large emails when the total bandwidth is 5 Mb/s.  
Or maybe an even more famous example is Moore's Law and how many claimed computers would stop getting faster because there are only so many transistors you could put on a chip.  Then people started designing computer architecture in smarter ways and computers got even faster.
Ultimately if a technology is powerful enough, seductive enough to capture the imaginations of the uber geeks, a lot that seem unsurmountable to the small-minded can be overcome.
Will this happen with Bitcoin?  Maybe not.  But it's going to take more than simple naysaying to stop those who already see this as the greatest disruptive technology since the Internet.

All the major altcoins are going down massively though.  So it just seems like money is coming out of cryptospace in general.

And to state even more of the obvious, people are selling to people that are buying.  And there are a lot of people that want to buy (did you see how many people are lining up to buy crypto through Robinhood -- new people not already buying it through Coinbase etc.?).  So the more it drops under 10, the more it stabilizes and reverses course to above 10.  See what I did there? :)

The Tether inflation theory ultimately relies on Bitfinex buying BTC (or other coins) with USDT they just created (not backed by USD).  By doing so, a bunch of people are selling bitcoins to Bitfinex for basically nothing (since supposedly they cannot redeem USDT for USD).  
Now you might ask, why can't a major exchange like Bitfinex, just buy BTC with fiat (EUR or USD), that they supposedly deposit into customer accounts (but is just created out of nothing)?  Why do they need to bother with this convoluted Tether thing?
Well the simple answer is they don't have to.  They could just print EUR or USD, buy BTC, and just abscond with the funds.  No Tether needed.  
But some people like conspiracy theories.  Simple scams aren't complicated enough for them.

I think it was Mike Novogratz that said 50k by february (or a very similarly outlandish prediction).  And then end of Dec, he announces he's pulling out temporarily and BTC may go as low as 8k.   In his case, he can influence markets.  So I wouldn't call him an "armchair expert" -- more like a savvy market manipulator.

I'm looking at their page and it says sold out.  Did they really sell out that quickly?

It happens.  Most of the time GDAX will be higher -- that's true.

"&lt;Shiller&gt; has a good understanding of math."  (MIT sends you thanks for backing up their assessment of his skillz when they awarded him undergrad and doctorate degrees)
"&lt;Soros&gt; was already an old man..." (old people don't get shit, I guess, unlike 16 year olds writing anonymously from their mom's basement).

Keep in mind that's almost exactly what people were saying in 1929 before the big crash, just change "2018" to "1929" and "1970" to "1900".

Right on.  People forget Bill Gates (and Microsoft) actually underestimated the Internet.  That's why they had to take underhanded actions against Netscape, once they figured out they had missed the first-move advantage.
