Did you not turn encryption on? That's the important part. If the wallet is encrypted, then anyone who uses your computer needs the passphrase. Otherwise, the only way to get access to your Electrum wallet is to have the original seed and restore it.

Restore from seed.

If you're using Tails and did not set up a persistence drive on the OS, then your Electrum Wallet data was deleted when it was shut down. Electrum still has your wallet info and you just need to restore from seed. Tails will erase everything that isn't in its persistence drive every time you shut down.

You have persistence enabled for Electrum specifically? There's a setting when you enable it to include Electrum into the persistence; otherwise, it will erase.
You don't need to reinstall anything. And you shouldn't "back up" anything on Tails; it defeats the purpose. Just restore the wallet from seed.

This has never happened to me. It only holds the amount in BTC equivalent to the value of the ACH moved in, in all my experience in the past couple of years. So even with an ACH pending, I can move my btc into my own wallet so long as there's enough money in the account to cover the ach if it doesn't go through. I think, though, that if the value of btc goes down, sometimes it holds more of the btc than you initially bought. Given that the price has gone up substantially, I wouldn't think this would affect you.

Use Gemini. You don’t get access to the btc until your usd transfer clears, but you can buy the btc immediately. No transfer fee, and way smaller purchase fee than Coinbase.

I learned my lesson a few months ago when the ETF was rejected. From 1200 down to $700 in the matter of days. Disheartened and feeling like Bitcoin's future was sealed with that rejection, I panic-sold *everything*. I had some expenses come up with my car breaking down anyway, so I used the funds to pay that off. Within another week or so, it was back at $1100 and holding steady.
I started buying back at $1200 -- pretty small amounts and I've nowhere near as much as I had earlier -- but I know better now: never sell; buy the dip; always hodl.

You know the market in general has been in a bubble for the past five years or so too, right? There's a bull-run in both the centralized and decentralized markets right now, but the correct advice for any type of investment is always: time **in** the market, not tim**ing** the market.

It's not just AlphaBay. That was just the largest market. Hansa was taken down last week as well. Everyone is afraid that Dream is compromised, if you check (even living a clean lifestyle, it's worth reading through that sub right now because it's seriously like watching a Showtime drama). Most of the dark net economy has ground to a halt and will probably be like that for a few months.

I literally just set up a limit order on Gemini to buy a little bit more at $2425 (Gemini was reporting $2480 at the time). It was filled immediately. Price keeps jumping up and falling back down every few minutes. hahaha. No clue what's going to happen, but if it drops low enough, I might have to pick up more.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:00:29
Gemini's at $2750 too.

Sales tax in the US depends on the state; there's no such thing as a federal sales tax, like what exists in Canada (the only country I know with both federal and provincial sales tax, not saying you're Canadian). So in the state I live, it's 6%, and 10 minutes down the street and over a bridge, you pay 11%. Some states pay 0% sales tax and make it up in other areas.

The goal of Marxism-Leninism is the eventual dissolution of the state until anarcho-communism can be achieved. The state is just seen as necessary in the interim to protect the socialist end goal. A planned economy is not necessary for Leninism, only the control of the state by a vanguard party representing the workers.

Every rally is followed by a price drop. You're not going to skyrocket up and stabilize immediately. We know a drop will come anytime it goes up quickly.
