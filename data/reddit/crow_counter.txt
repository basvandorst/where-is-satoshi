every time is a "bit different." but that is why it has always taken balls to hodl. it was never easy. back in the day it was way tougher (2013 - 2015). now we have strongholds in the world's third largest economy (Japan) and other key countries: USA, UK, Germnay, and S Korea.  This was totally not in place before.
as a result now the downside is much less. i am sure we will see some serious alt implosions in 2018 and people will start to realize bitcoin's advantages. 
diversify a bit. but realize most alts will eventually implode. we have seen it throughout the years. when they do, there will be a flight of safety to bitcoin. tough to predict when.

@_date: 2018-09-16 07:00:14


All of them would have to agree to do so. Even if they have 90%, the 10% they don't control will include your transaction if you have a reasonable fee.


Only if they have greater than 51% of the network (and in that case, if they have that much of the hardware, they are heavily incentivized not to destroy the value of the coin). 


Umm what? No they can't.


No matter what, they can never move your Bitcoins without your private key. 
You don't have a clue dude.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:31:22

I am not jrat. "Miners" are not a monolithic entity. They are in competition with eachother, and anyone can join the competition. They do not not have control of the network. None of what I wrote contradicts the twitter post though. I have been using Bitcoin since 2013 and the miners sure as shit can't move my coins. You don't understand Bitcoin at all. The beauty of the system is that if miners decide to not approve transactions or whatever, someone else can start mining.

@_date: 2018-08-16 00:40:06
yes, it is a good point. but there is spirited debate within the core community as well. you can read the mailing list discussions, dev chats, etc. which are all public. and the core devs voice their opinions publicly. Bcash is much more clandestine behind the scenes and not publicly available chat logs, etc. (as far as i know). just look at how quickly the previous difficulty adjustments were announced and then immediately implemented.

the news from the grapevine is that a lot of ICO projects have been panicking and cashing out to secure their funding in fiat. BTC will be less and less affected as its dominance gets back up with shitcoins imploding (as you can see from looking at coins in their price vs BTC during this last dip)
@_date: 2018-08-23 05:44:52
You are totally clueless. You don't understand several factors.
1. Futures volume is super small, its inconsequential. Bitmex has existed far longer and already allowed shorting. 
2. Its not like bitcoiners got to decide if futures are created or not. it is not in our control.
3. If Bitcoin were to die because of the existence of futures, it would ultimately fail anyway, futures are inevitable. 
Bitcoin goes through massive hype cycles, the crash was inevitable in 2018, and it will probably happen again. That is totally fine. Once you see enough, you get used to it.
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:22:42
No it doesn't, the users control the network. If they didn't, we would all be on the Bcash chain right now. But miners must follow users, that is what 2017 showed us.
@_date: 2018-09-04 17:01:08
No, that is totally right. It is best to talk to to people that actually want to learn about Bitcoin, rather than try to push people that don't care.
 They will probably get interested at some point and ask you about it eventually (when it is still around a couple of years from now and many sheeple start to realize its not just a fad).

No, you don't get to decide how people should use their Bitcoin. If people want to preserve their purchasing power in Bitcoin for long periods, that is a totally fine and valid use case. If people want to speculate, that is their prerogative. The whole point of Bitcoin is that you can use the Blockchain however you like, regardless of whether other people think you are using it the "right way."
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:36:45
there is no real adoption of Bcash, it is all a myth perpetuated by the use of a lot of sockpuppets, and people bribed with small amounts of bcash to serve as a troll army. this is obvious if you look how the exchange rate has fallen, despite Bitmain dumping tons of money into defending the BTC/BCH. you are really buying into a coin that is completely controlled by Bitmain. they own a huge amount of supply, and they change the consensus rules as they see fit (see previous difficult adjustments, there was no community consensus, they just changed it as they saw fit. it also allowed them to create an extra 100k Bcash for themselves). they also could easily change the supply since the bcash people are totally fine with the mining overlords.
Bitcoin --&gt; users decide the consensus rules and run their own nodes. the users believe in a fee market and 2nd layer solutions are necessary to scale. it is very difficult to change the rules as everyone is very much about the 21M hardcap.
Bcash --&gt; users are totally OK with miners / large companies running all of the the nodes, the network, deciding the changes to code (which could include changing the 21M cap), etc.
Choose whichever you think is better. There are pros and cons to each.

We are bootstrapping from $0. It is only 9 years old. It will take much longer to achieve its potential, it needs a much larger market cap before it could be stable and achieve currency status.

LOL. Also we don't need crypto to completely take over fiat for it to be a good investment by our retirement. Just to maintain or appreciate in value. Taking over fiat will likely take a long time as you said (unless a major catalyzing event which is possible).

just watched it on hbo go. he covered the basics accurately and its potential. said companies like walmart, IBM, JPMorgan are using it. his theme at the start and the end was that it is very difficult to predict the future as it relates to technology. "you need to be careful"
said: "no one yet knows what blockchain is really capable of it"
he accurately covered that people are making a ton of shitcoins that have no value. and that they can rocket in value despite being a joke like dogecoin. he also covered pump and dump groups and scams like bitconnect.
covered these terms:
near the end:
"i am not saying that every cryptocurrency is a scam. i am saying that in speculative mania it can be very difficult to tell which coins are for real"
could be investing in Google or investing in Google glasses was the final message at the end by Michael Keegan as he rightfully lampooned Carlos Matos' infamous speech. 
"never invest anymore than you are willing to lose" in that bit.
overall i think it was well done and accurate. i would say its good for Bitcoin but bad for shitcoins and scamcoins trying to dupe newbies.

Of course after viciously attacking Bitcoin with all types of FUD, clogging the mempool with tons of transactions just to drive up fees, personally attacking the devs who tirelessly work on the code for 0 compensation, confusing newbies about what the "real bitcoin" is, and spreading tons of FUD about the "flippening."

That doesn't hurt Bitcoin though. It is highly divisible so if some people want to hold it, whether by controlling the private keys or holding an ETF, that just drives the price up. It doesn't hurt usability though.

But someone can initiate a reversal of the paypal payment later (like claiming fraud) and then your bank account gets debited, so the transaction is not truly "complete." The bitcoin transaction is truly complete and irreversible after a confirmation.

Yes, good points. But just want to clarify one thing: Bitcoin isn't designed to replace the entire financial system and all of the bankers' functions. It is designed to be hard money. In a capitalist system things like a Bitcoin ETF will be formed. The whole point of Bitcoin is that anyone can use it, and that includes the financial system. It is not against Bitcoin's purpose or objective if it becomes adopted by the financial system, it is a natural consequence.

you seem to have a very US-centric view. many people in the world do not have access to bank accounts or banking services because banks don't see the value in offering them bank accounts or banking services.
