The reason you're getting some flak is because the person on the other end of the line was a poorly paid support representative at some big support center, just doing what they're told to do without any of their own input or thought. It wasn't Ashley's fault here, it was her managers/Coin.MX.
tl;dr, you're not wrong you're just an asshole.

How and where can I buy Litecoins, please?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:00:02
I'd like to know this too, thanks.
@_date: 2013-03-09 15:25:02
Thanks for that! As a Student fortunate enough to be fully supported by my parents, I really have no bills to pay at all - I'm very lucky. What's more, I feel ready to buckle up and ride out the peaks and troughs associated with investments like this.
I was wondering though - are bitcoins likely to drop soon in your opinion? Considering the all time high price currently, should I just wait until confidence falters, the prices drop, and then buy in?

In the 'He's full of shit' phase.
@_date: 2013-03-10 20:36:11
I think you missed the point here buddy. The point being, this mis-information is tarnishing Bitcoin and our community with utter bullshit.
To summarize: Sure, let the crazy guy be crazy, but if he decides to come be crazy over here, politely tell him to shut the fuck up.

I'm going to be downvoted to oblivion, but...
In this scenario, I'd personally 'play the game'. I would, nor could, ever convince myself to steal. I have strong morals. But in this scenario, the consequences of Coinbase messing up have landed you with an extra $1000. I'm assuming Coinbase aren't going to go under as a result, and you haven't really stole anything as it was just circumstances beyond your control leaving you with the large profit.
Sorry if that offends/upsets anyone, but I'll heartily express my opinion at the cost of a heap of downvotes. Just my 2cents.

If all goes to plan I'll be starting my Officer commision in September, no College/University here! :)
As soon as I'm done with sixth form/high school I'm aiming to stand on my own feet.

Came here to say this, prime gift right here.

Yeah, I'm a crack whore - you got me.
But in all seriousness: I do charity work, I pickup a shit-ton of litter, I volunteer in my community, I share everything I can with friends and family, so on and so forth.
Having said that... there are many situations I can think of where I would have very weak morals, such as saving myself versus sacrificing myself to save others. I'm afraid for me, that's a pretty easy decision (save myself (depending on who - family, I'd die, stranger, I'd live)). My point is, I guess you've got a point. Having strong morals perhaps isn't a case of 'you do or you don't', perhaps it's more complicated than that.
@_date: 2013-03-10 20:36:34
That's actually pretty neat :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:34:41
I take it you're implying it'd be foolish to buy in today?
Why, may I ask?
