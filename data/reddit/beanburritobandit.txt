That's only if there is parity between BTC and ETH. If there BTC increased in value before you sold it for ETH, you owe capital gains on the profit of the BTC sold.
Buy 10 BTC @ $100 USD
BTC increased in value to $2000 USD
One year elapses
Sell 0.5 BTC for 1 ETH at $1000 USD
You owe $142.50 in capital gains tax (15% long term) since the 0.5 BTC appreciated from $50 (cost basis) to $1000 with $950 profit. 
ETA: if you buy BTC and instantly (no increase/decrease in value) use it to purchase an alt, then there are no profits to tax.

One of these things is not like the others.

I think Bitcoin will be $1,000,000,000 by the year 2050.
Is this how it works?

You only take a loss if you cash out or spend it (for less than what you exchanged it for). 
If you bought 2BTC @ $400 a piece, you still have 2 BTC. If you can't be bothered to store those 2 BTC and it's burning a hole in your HDD, and you exchange for USD/Euro/Pound /etc. @ $200....well yeah you took a loss. You bought "high" and sold "low."
2BTC is 2BTC. This is why the game is long.
Disclosure: did not buy under $100 or over $800

He pled on money laundering and what he did is the definition of embezzlement.


They had enough to have him plead out. You can bet they would have thrown the book had he not.
