Every piece of *negative* news about cryptocurrency in China and Korea comes from CNBC and Bloomberg.
If you Google China cryptocurrency ban all you get is cnbc links

I'm having trouble with my Chase ach transfer and my Chase freedom card going through coinbase. First i did the bank account transfer because of the smaller fees but it says will arrive in 7 days, buying eth. Then i figure I'll just do it with cc if it's instant and i have the chase freedom card and it's showing estimated arrival of eth for both transactions is 7 days

Goddamn that was a genius idea but its* taught us to be weary of qr codes now
*(&lt;is that the right use tho because it's not "it's"??) It should be "it has taught" so you could use"it's" for 'it has'? Maybe?

r/wsb is mainly a bunch of guys who have really good salaries/ wealthy in some way and just do stupid things when they feel like throwing money away. You know, like the millions of people that walk into a casino every minute all over the world. And then there's some youngins that don't know better

Learned about it as bitcoin just came out when all I did was game, and thought it would be so easy to just set up a pc and get free money right? What a great opportunity. Then I figured oh God if I really do this I might get like only $1 a month with like thousands of coins what's the point.. UT2k4 was more enjoyable

For real, people think they 'know how to play the market' and "study" it, it's all about luck. Or insiders. For most that get rich off it it's the latter.

When it comes to American measurements i always wonder how people decide to say either yard or feet. When I'm cooking it's the worst when the recipe calls for like ounces or some kinda fraction of a cup and i go to the store to buy the containers are all in pints or quarts or some shit where i have to do 2 to 3 conversions until i get the unit I need. But the best part is that the containers that say quart/pint usually will say the conversion in liters, meanwhile I'm over here trying to figure out how many cups are in half a pint or something shit.

Still don't understand why you can't just put it on a flash drive/portable hard drive. 
And I'm still trying to figure out what it is you're actually storing? Just a text file with the code on it? Is that all you need for your "coin"? Just the 'key'? And key= random sequence of letters and numbers?
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:46:18
Ok fluid ounces, but what about the 'other' ounces?

Why do people make such a big deal out of stores being sold out when you can just buy them on Amazon, even prime?
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:17:39

Isn't a 1080 like $1100? It's on prime for $870
