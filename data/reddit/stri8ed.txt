For Bitcoin to succeed as a currency, it needs to be easier to make purchases using it, than Fiat. The dark net is an exception , since the utility of the decentralized aspects outweighs the inconveniences. Currently, it's far easier (in majority of use cases) to use Fiat.

If that's the case, could one more effectively prevent double spends by not accepting (0 conf) payments with insufficient fee?
Or what about connecting to N random nodes, and requiring that they all have the tx in mem-pool otherwise reject (require confirmation) the transaction? Is there anything in the P2P protocol which enables one to determine if a peer has received a particular transaction?
@_date: 2016-08-28 15:37:48
Assuming you publish the second transaction minutes later, wouldn't all the nodes/miners already have the 1st transaction in mem-pool, and reject the second? (assuming RBF is not enabled for the transaction).

True, but if Bitcoin is to be adopted as an actual currency, individuals should be constantly moving funds (i.e. making purchases).
Its true individual users have less than an exchange, but individuals can be attacked at scale (e.g. hacking a wallet). Furthermore, due to transparency of blockchain, attackers can identify high profile individuals to attack.

No way to undo a confirmation, unless you can fork the chain on the parent block, which is unlikely unless you control &gt; 50% of mining power.
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:28:32
Because the use-cases of Bitcoin have not increased. It's not any more convenient to purchase using Bitcoin than it was 5 years ago. I think microtransaction have the potential to change that. Think pay per view articles, Steemit-like blogging, etc.. This depends on the lightning network being deployed, which itself holds massive potential: Instant, (almost) fee-less peer to peer transactions. PayPal can already do this, but its centralized and not accessible to all.

Payment channels solves this problem. The idea being, you deposit some Bitcoin into a 2 of 2 multisig with Brave, and whenever you make a transaction, you invalidate the previous transaction, and when the channel is ready to be closed out, only the latest transaction is published on the blockchain.

Considering as LN uses intermediaries to transfer funds between non-connected parties, wouldn't this mean the intermediary must know the amounts being transferred? Though I suppose the LN is designed for small transactions, so this is not a huge privacy concern.

Good point. Its as if the money is stored in a 2 of 2 multisig, with attacker and owner as signers. If this is the case, I fail to see how this deters attackers. If Bitfinex had used this and the reversal key was stolen, they would effectively  be in the same situation, unable to release customers funds. Essentially the attacker could hold a business hostage, until they pay a ransom.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:51:19
Agreed. The anonymity of Bitcoin is a double edged sword. The incentives to hack bitcoin wallets are simply too high. There is a proposal to add vault like functionality to the protocol, which could theoretically make it less easy to steal funds.
Add much as it's technically correct to blame the users for poor securing of keys, for mainstream adoption to happen,  we need to make Bitcoin more tolerant to naivety.
@_date: 2016-08-15 14:59:52
No matter which way you slice it, it's not feasible to do every single transaction on the block-chain. The fact that even Etherium is developing a lightning network implementation, I think is quite telling.

IMO Craig is either Satoshi or closely related to him. Reason being: 
Assuming he is not Satoshi, by claiming he is, he knows there is a very real possibility that the real Satoshi can cryptographically expose him as a fraud. To come forward, despite such an obvious risk, tells me he is either confident that the real Satoshi cannot come forward (e.g Dave Kleiman being dead), or he is indeed Satoshi. More likely it's the former.

If that's what it would take for the rest of the ecosystem to adopt SegWit and move forward, then I consider that a worthwhile benefit. Sometimes its better to be pragmatic and find a solution all parties can embrace, than being dogmatic and getting nowhere. Some might say, its just noise and most miners really support SegWit, but the numbers say otherwise. Clearly there is some resistance which must be understood, and hopefully addressed.

Completely disagree with Roger about RBF being problematic. He assumes good-will on part of miners, which is not a sound assumption. We need to assume worst-case scenarios, as they will in time be exploited.
Furthermore, I don't buy the common argument miners are incentive's to be good citizens, since they want Bitcoin to succeed etc.. The evidence contradicts this claim: Centralization of hashing power, mining empty blocks. Also, this assumes miners are in Bitcoin for the long haul. This is not necessarily true. I can be a rational miner, and advocate for changes which benefit Bitcoin short-term but harm long term viability. [Here]( is a good example.
As a side note, Roger needs to talk slower.

If the users where OK with such use-cases, it would no longer be considered spam, as per your definition. Also, you are equating the costs of manually sifting through spam, to your CPU burning cycles. This is not a fair comparison imo.
Also, how is it any different from my node having to verify millions of transactions, which I could care less about? You may say, I have implicitly consented to it, given the nature of the system. But then again, if such transactions are being accepted by the system, it means it falls within the "nature of the system.

Define super-majority? 
What happens if say the other 40% keeps the existing consensus rules, which Bitcoin is the real one? When Coinbase buys/sells Bitcoin which chain should it be from. How does a consumer know if the Bitcoin they purchase will be accepted by a given node? What about exchanges? If you buy BTC from one exchange, how do I know if it will be acceptable on another? Simply going with most POW chain is not viable, as this would would mean a chain removing the 21 million rule for example, could still be the valid chain.
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:27:22
To be fair, that was not his main argument. His primary point of contention was, greater throughput and smaller fees, which he thinks would be best addressed by BU. Arguably SegWit+LN can solve this, but I would concede that deployment of LN can take years and is not a guaranteed success.
@_date: 2017-02-03 12:30:44

@_date: 2017-02-15 04:14:59
Currently, participating in the Bitcoin network requires each node to verify every transaction that occurs in the system. As you might imagine, this is not very scalable, at least while preserving decentralization. So for instance, if somebody in Tokyo buys a coffee, your node in California needs to receive and verify that transaction.
You can increase block size to increase throughput, but this property remains. So the risk is, the network becoming more centralized, since cost to participate is increased as usage increases.
LN attempts to address this problem, by moving transactions off chain, such that nodes need to verify less transactions, even as usage dramatically increases.
Is it necessary? No. But clearly for Bitcoin to be used at scale as a payment method, it cannot expect every node to receive and verify every transaction. LN is potentially one way to solve this, others might be sharding the block chain.
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:49:53

"Ethically" you may be correct. But for all intents and purposes, the distinction is irrelevant, so we may as well treat it as such. Since there is no deterministic way to correctly classify a transaction as spam/not.

Arguably LN also does, to fix malleability. Granted it can still function without, but this would seriously hurt usability.

Strong conclusions. So because DAO is complex and it failed, this means anything that is complex will suffer the same fate?
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:06:32
1) Sure. China banning bitcoin mining would be one instance of this.
2) Increase the time it takes for transactions to get confirmed. At least until the difficulty readjust to compensate for lost hashing power.
3) Would weaken the networks security, making it more susceptible to 51% attack, which could enable censoring transactions or completely disrupting network by not confirming any transactions. This would be temporary, as other (honest) miners can join the network to compensate. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:22:14


You are forgetting about the lightning network, which would make transaction fees (off-chain) extraordinarily cheap. Since users would be performing less transactions on the block-chain, they would be fine with paying higher fees when they do. So all that's needed is a large enough user-base making infrequent, albeit more expensive, on-chain transactions, and the mining would be profitable.
@_date: 2016-06-19 16:46:53
The problem with the difficulty going down is, it makes it easier for  governments with significant resources to overpower the network, and begin censoring transactions etc.. aka the 51% attack.
@_date: 2016-06-19 16:51:13
Was wondering the same thing. Couldn't a malicious actor (government) attack the network by introducing significant compute power into the network, and once the difficulty grows very high, withdraw all resources from the network. This would dramatically increase the time it takes for transactions to be confirmed, as well as makes it not profitable for other miners. Granted this would only last until the difficulty is readjusted, but it could be enough to shake public confidence in the network.
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:09:13


Doubt that.
@_date: 2016-06-19 18:00:33
Yes. Profit by making the network not reliable, which in turn leads to people not using it, and instead using the government controlled currency.
Another possibility is introducing massive hashing power into the network, at a financial loss, which would make honest miners non-profitable and thus leave the network, giving way to a 51% attack where government can censor transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-21 04:45:45
Indeed, there must be a credible threat of changing the POW via hard fork, otherwise miners will forever control the protocol.

@_date: 2017-01-20 21:21:00
That's like saying not buying the latest Macbook is a form of coercing Apple into thinking a certain way. Its called a free market. Miners offer a product, the ability to add your transaction to network history, users pay a fee for this product. If a competing miner offers a better product, then users should have the liberty to vote with their money for the better product. No different than supporting eco-friendly companies.
If there was some way of enabling users to vote with their money, this would be a much better way of giving the network majority a voice, as opposed to threatening a hard fork POW change, which will never happen. Though, I suppose it could be gamed by creating many "fake" transactions, for the sole purpose of influencing the protocol.

@_date: 2017-01-17 00:59:00
Small correction: Bitcoin does not need miners to verify transactions, full nodes can do it. Miners are needed to make the current state of the ledger tamper-resistant, such that its extremely costly to rewrite the history and ordering of previous transactions. Without enough (decentralized) mining power, you run run the risk of making it easy for attackers to undo previous transactions, as well as censor which transactions get added to the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:10:30
That would be a non issue if the hard-fork included a POW change. That's the only real leverage against miners.

In truth, its really the exchanges, wallets, and businesses who control Bitcoin. In event of a hard-fork, the key to determining which fork would be Bitcoin proper, would ultimately depend on how companies like Coinbase, BitGo etc.. handle it. Without merchants or exchanges accepting the Bitcoin fork, its value would plummet rather quickly.

I am not opposed to increasing the block-size. I am opposed to doing in in a "dumb" way, e.g. changing a variable or two.  I think for Bitcoin to remain decentralized while scalable, it must implement some form of sharding, whereby every node does not need to verify every single transaction that occurs on the network.  Ethereum seems to have realized this, and is working towards solutions.
That being said, I would have no problem with increasing the blocks-size by a few MB, to allow more breathing space for developing smarter solutions.

You seem to be mistaken. The only thing Bitcoin devs control is the open-source Bitcoin Core Github repository. Control would imply that devs can dictate what software nodes/miners run. This is patently false. If you have evidence pointing to the contrary, I would be interested in seeing it.
As for economic incentives, you are assuming that the miners have a long term economic interest in Bitcoin. This may not be the case. Miners are running a business, which is aligned only to their bottom line. Furthermore, there is a reason miners sell their Bitcoin for fiat. If they truly where aligned with BTC long-term success, this would be irrational.
A good example of this short-term profit seeking motives, with no regard to Bitcoins long-term durability, would be Circle. The CEO has been quoted saying "Nobody Will Be Using Bitcoin in 5 to 10 Years". In light of such views, it would be perfectly reasonable to push for an immediate massive "dumb" form of on-chain scaling, at the cost of long-term security and decentralization.
As for the weakness inherit in a chain with less POW, this can perhaps be overcome by some form of POS + POW hybrid. 
I think it would be a great thing, if miners where too scared to develop ASIC's, out of fear of a POW change. This would only improve decentralization.

No doubt, there are physical bounds. My point was, Bitcoin needs to be able to remain usable, whilst under heavy loads, even those generated by adversaries. I had not thought much about fees, that does make sense. Though it's still far cheaper to disrupt Bitcoin via spamming the network with transactions, than a 51% attack. But I suppose no system is perfect.

Its rather unfortunate the direction Roger has taken. I don't doubt he wishes the best for Bitcoin, and in all fairness he probably played a part in Bitcoin's initial success, but he seems to have lost touch with reality, and has resorted to petty drama and name-calling.
The irony is, its only because of Greg Maxwell (and a few other Blockstream devs) who wrote secp256k1, that Bitcoin can actually be synced and verified in a reasonable amount of time on a desktop PC, which Roger frequently touts in support of bigger blocks.
Its one think to make an argument for bigger blocks, and work towards reaching some pragmatic short term compromise, while long-term solutions can be researched. But with this never ending tirade of Core conspiracy theories, it seems his ego has got in the way of resolving the actual problem at hand. Unfortunate.
Than again, if the Bitcoin community cannot surmount this, then there little hope it can withstand an attack by a  government entity. So maybe this will be for the better, and work as a stress test for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Sounds reasonable. Contrary to many here, I believe Rogers intentions are pure. Only his technical assessments are poor and short sighted imo. Specifically, attempting to raise the block size without bounds, prior to implementing some form of sharding or Treechains.
I understand the scepticism towards Lighting, as its success is far from guaranteed. However for on chain scaling to happen, you need to first develop ways of distributing the blockchain, otherwise you risk massive centralization.

Essentially to update the balance to a new transaction, the Bob provides Alice with a means (hash pre-image) of spending the old transaction, should it ever be broadcasted on the blockchain. The transaction has a timelock as well, so Alice has time to discover the old transaction has been broadcasted, and spend all of it as a punishment, before Bob can actually redeem it.

It would be a disaster. Assuming Bitcoin is massively successful, and becomes a global currency, you cannot expect the world to wait for the devs to issue an update, followed by miner adoption. It could take weeks, perhaps months.

To be fair, we can completely fix the problem by making the block limit 0MB. But this is not a great solution. It seems some form of sharding will be necessary to make it viable for more people to run full nodes, whilst enabling the block-size to be increased safely.

@_date: 2016-12-17 17:18:10
You are correct, my current connection is tethering from my phone. We can argue about the exact numbers, but I think its fair to say, if Bitcoin really took off, it would be unfeasible for every node to process every single transaction, especially if you want to support low-fee micro-transactions.
I do not agree that most users need to run full nodes. However I do believe, that as the resources necessary increase, full nodes will drop off, to the point where it is largely commercially entities. In which case, I am uncertain about the viability of Bitcoin.
You may not notice the impact of running a node now, but if the throughput increased 100x, which is not unreasonable, its likely you would. My point is not that we must forever cap throughput, rather in the long run we need smarter distributed scaling solutions. Etherium seems to have realized this, and is actively working on such solutions.
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:45:45
That's actually pretty funny. Though I'm not sure why this is relevant to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-13 15:22:09
I think the problem comes down to lack of incentives. You are asking users to consume their resources (bandwidth, disk, CPU) in exchange for what? Yes, I know in theory they are increasing the value of their assets, since Bitcoin benefits from decentralization. Thing is, this is not an immediately tangible benefit. If only there was some form of reward, I suspect this problem would go away rather quickly.
@_date: 2016-12-17 15:56:36
There is always the possibility of using checkpoints. I.e. assuming that beyond a certain depth, there will no reorgs. In this way, we can assume its "safe" to download say only the previous years worth of transactions.
I disagree about motivated users downloading it, irrespective of size. Take me for example, if I had better bandwidth today, I would gladly run a full-node. However, if the block size was massive, between the bandwidth, CPU, and disk space, I would loose motivation to run it, as the costs now  outweigh the perceived benefits. Clearly, in the long run there must be some form of sharding, such that every node need not verify and store every single transaction. Lightning network can potentially solve this, though I am skeptical.

Typically a seller will generate a unique address per order, so they can easily associate the payment with the order.
@_date: 2016-09-05 04:20:07
The idea is to allow miners to create bigger blocks, but associate a cost with it, to disincentive block size increases. The cost can be a greater difficulty level, or forgoing the mining rewards for that block. And conversely, miners are also incentivised to decrease the block size, by reduced difficulty levels, or being able to claim the rewards which where unclaimed during creation of bigger blocks.

What happens if the user uses multiple browsers? Wouldn't it make more sense to store the encrypted key on the server?
@_date: 2016-09-04 22:06:32
I suspect the concern would be, once you set such a precedent where does it end. One of the major selling points of BTC has always been the fixed and predictable supply. (granted, a fixed emission would be predictable). There needs to be strong incentives for existing stakeholders to be willing to dilute their assets.
@_date: 2016-09-06 21:49:20
If they would implement support for [WebExtensions]( I would seriously consider using it. Until then, I wait.
@_date: 2016-09-03 04:48:33
It needs to support webextensions for me to seriously consider switching from chrome.
@_date: 2016-09-06 22:02:23
It does use the same web engine (Chromium) as Chrome, so it's likely the user-agent references this.
@_date: 2016-09-17 06:21:34
The devs are not hosting any content. They are simply providing a means for two entity's to conduct transactions, without an intermediary. Not unlike bitcoin, or a hammer, it's simply a neutral tool. Jailing the devs would be like jailing OpenSSL devs, since terrorist use it to encrypt communications.
Open Bazaar is similar to BitTorrent. It's a protocol for peer to peer communication. Only instead of files, you exchange product listings and transactions. Seeing as they could not stop torrents, I don't see why this should be much different.
Even if they hypothetically jailed the devs, this would not kill OpenBazaar. The protocol is out there, and any other dev (from a different country) can implement it in a new app. I suppose they could make it illegal to participate in the network. But i doubt that would hinder people selling illicit products.
@_date: 2016-09-03 05:55:39
I hear you. Thing is, if we want to implement microtransactions at scale, it is simply not possible to do on chain. Consider if YouTube implemented BTC microtransactions, the number of transactions would be astronomical. It seems to me that simply upping the block size would be a temporary fix, and escape the real problem at hand.
So long as all transactions need to be published to all nodes, and permanently stored on chain, microtransactions on chain will not be feasible, except perhaps with ridiculous centralization.
Also even with faster block times e.g. etherium 12 seconds, the transactions would still be nowhere near instant. Whereas LN has the potential to offer close to instant.
@_date: 2016-09-17 03:27:42
As long as its opt in, im all for more options.
@_date: 2016-09-03 04:51:03
The way people like yours intend to solve this is by using payment channels (e.g. lightning network). In theory this would enable instant transactions, with tiny fees.

@_date: 2016-09-17 17:44:03
Fair enough. Though, it's still superior to Craigslist, in that nobody can dictate what products can be listed on the network. Also, even without a moderator, you can still use a 2of2 multisig address, such that the buyer locks up funds with seller. This reduces incentives for buyer not to pay seller after receiving product.

Devs do not own the "club". They don't profit from it, and they do not have the capability to "kick out" nodes from the network.
The essence of your argument is, since you are providing tools, which among other things, make it easier to engage in illicit activities, you are legally responsible for said illicit activities.
Based on this reasoning, it would be consistent to legally pursue:
- USPS (Even more so, since they directly profit from the activities)
- Gun Shops
- Bitcoin, Monero, Bit-Torrent, &amp; Tor Developers
- WhatsApp

Being on the blockchain = confirmed. 1 confirmation means the transaction was included in the latest block. Prior to being confirmed, the transaction is stored in the memory of miners, and eventually included in a future block (assuming the fees are high enough). A pending transaction means the transaction was received by node(s) in the network, but not yet included in a block.

Bummer that it can't be implemented into Bitcoin. My concern with sidechains are there impacts to usability. It means the average consumer cannot make a Bitcoin private transaction without understanding the technical underpinnings, and first transferring the BTC to side chain tokens. I would really love to see improved privacy at the protocol level, even if that meant slightly larger transactions. Are sidechains really that much better than buying with Monero, and using Shapeshift to convert to BTC?

Braiding is definitely interesting. It does seem that to enable small nodes to continue to participate in the network, some form of sharding will need to be implemented eventually. It cannot be the case that every node must store every single transaction in perpetuity. Yes there is pruning, but even so, this still requires every node to verify every single transaction. And the time to start up a node and perform initial sync, will become huge over time.
@_date: 2016-10-24 16:10:29

Glad to see well articulated arguments being posted here, even if I don't entirely agree with them. Free market of ideas is a good thing.
More specifically, the author completely disregards the other benefits Segwit brings, and proceeds to claim the technical complexity is insufficiently justified by the meagre scaling improvements. 
Regarding Lightning, the author says:


If slow confirmations are not problematic, than why should small blocks be a problem? It simply delays confirmation times. I would agree, that LN is still way too immature to depend on its success as **the** scaling solution.
@_date: 2016-10-06 23:52:39
Smart idea.
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:29:53
In the braiding scheme, how are block rewards distributed if there are multiple sibling blocks? Also, is there any intent for something like braiding to ever being implemented into Bitcoin proper, or is it merely theoretical discussions?

@_date: 2016-10-12 20:05:41
Strictly speaking, it would not cap the transaction volumes (assuming the mempool is not capped). It would delay confirmation times. It would also increase fees, to a point. If users refuse to pay higher fees, the miners will have no choice but to accept lower fees. If the fees continues to rise, this would suggest users do put a high value on confirmation times.

The trouble here is, since nobody owns the Bitcoin trademark, any altcoin is free to masquerade as "the Bitcoin", which could thoroughly confuse consumers.
@_date: 2016-10-09 00:49:14
What troubles me about LN is, what happens if you cannot find a path to your recipient? You might say, just open a direct channel. The problem is, due to the nature of payment channels, I may have all of my funds locked up in existing channels, and I will be unable to fund the new channel. That the capability of issuing payments to any node on the network is not guaranteed, seems like a big problem. Or are my missing something?
Another issue is, transaction delays will not be uniform. Specifically when opening a channel it could take 10+ minutes, whereas other payments will be instant. To somebody technically informed, this is understandable. But could the layman grasp this?
@_date: 2016-10-12 23:14:02

Any payment which can be routed via open channels. Granted, strictly speaking you still need to close the channel to finalize the payment(s).

I thought it was quite clear. The ability to transfer funds across borders, nearly instantaneously, at low fees, without requiring anyone's permission, without censorship, and with a guaranteed limit on inflation.

Personally I think microtransactions, especially machine to machine can be huge. However, this would require something like the lightning network, to provide low enough fees.

Why store data locally, when you can store it on the cloud for redundancy and remote access from other devices.

How is it guaranteed that files won't be lost? What if multiple nodes go offline?
With respect to illegal content, I am more concerned about government intervention. Specifically, if it is found that you are hosting illegal content, could you be held accountable. Presumably to access a file you need to connect to the nodes that store it. So once you have the file identifier, I imagine its trivial to see which nodes/IP's are storing it?
@_date: 2016-07-19 14:50:18
But is that necessarily a bad thing? So long as the fundamentals of Bitcoin remain in place, I see no harm in having more options. Kinda like Coinbase. Perhaps it's even a good thing, since it incentivises existing big players to be more pro-Bitcoin, since there's economic opportunities for them.

Interesting article. I don't think it's fair to dismiss the lightning network and off-chain transactions, as they do serve a need that cannot be met with standard transactions. Specifically:
1) Confirmation times. Instant transactions are necessary for many use cases, especially with RBF available.
2) Microtransactions. Paying 1 cent to watch a Youtube video ad-free would be impossible with on-chain transactions.
I do wonder if shorter block times would be beneficial to BitCoin. While its true one confirmation will be less secure, it still would make double spending non-trivial.

Yea. Quite a fascinating discussion. I find it interesting at the end, where they describe the use cases of LN and where it's less useful, e.g. one time large transactions. So it does seem lightning network is not the sole answer to scalability. We probably will need to increase the block size at some point.

Pruning is definitely an interesting idea. Has there been any research done on this? It seems regardless the size of the blocks, the block-chain will eventually reach a size where it is no longer "practical" for an average user to download. Which again, increases centralization.
