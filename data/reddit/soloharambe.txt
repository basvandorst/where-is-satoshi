If bitcoin is adopted, how will it overcome the problem with asymmetric information

Yea printing money holds back inflation, but the gold standard isnt the solution. So many problems such as financial panics, limited options to get out of recessions/depressions, restricted trade and growth, etc. thats why we moved away from it

Sometimes adjusting monetary base is necessary, if the country goes into a depression/recession how will it get out? Also in order to get these mortgages how will people overcome the problem with assymetric information? If bitcoin is adapted and get rid of these ‘big banks’ we’ll just have another firm that acts as a bank to connect people who need to borrow/lend money. Bitcoin definitely has some perks but putting your money into it is not gonna be a secure method of protecting your dollars’ purchasing power

Segwit for cheaper and faster confirmations

Whats the best way to do that? I did blockchain.info and used a receiving address and it showed no history
