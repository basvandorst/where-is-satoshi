I use TD Bank.  I used to work for their predecessor in this area.  Never had an issue.  Never had a call.

Credit unions give better rates because they are non-profit and do not pay the same taxes.  Not saying its good or bad, its just one of the reasons.

There is no inflation in the US.  That's what the government tells us.  And the government wouldn't lie.  Would they?  
(That's sarcasm, by the way.)

I was referencing the US.  Sorry--should have clarified that.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:11:06
Did they tell you it would generate a report, or because they were being wired or ACH'd it would not trigger one.  Just curious.

Take your pictures with the landlord in them.  Move-in Selfies of a sort.

Also..,if you sell it.  Do it in batches of less than $10K each.  Over several weeks.  Into several bank accounts.
Otherwise you will have the IRS and DHS and Treasury Dept up your ass.

This is behaving like any new "investment."  It will shoot up once when it is first discovered.  Then fall back.  Next it will start to attract serious investors/users.  Then it will fall back.  Finally, when it starts to gain wide acceptance, you will see another rotation out and a price decline as the second wave bails and the third wave settles in.
With the news out of china the other week, that is where we are now.  The second wave of buyers/users are reaping the benefits of hanging on over the past several months.  We will pop up (the chart is parabolic).  Expect it to drop back to the low 200's or so.  Then it will settle down for a while.  Then it will come up.
When that happens is anyone's guess.  But the rush to the door is going to be epic when it happens.  Look for something to cause it--a big initial investor bailing, something like Silk Road, or some ruling by the Treasury department in the US.
I think this might be long term, but be careful with money you cannot afford to lose.  I remember I had visions of a new BMW back in 1999.  They went poof in early 2000.

I have a twenty dollar gold coin.  It most certainly is money.

Take a closer look at it.  Moving the bitcoins from one to the other is easy.  Moving the money back to the starting point is not so easy.  You have limits on transactions amounts, and limits on withdrawls and wires.  When you add in fees and what not, it is pretty difficult to get more than a few dollars at a whack.  Its just not worth the effort at this stage.

Apologies.  Did not me to imply that you were doing anything wrong.
No, I do not want my books out there for everyone to see.  Especially my competitors.  They will know I am as close to going belly up as them!

That is a great way of explaining it.  I had been scratching my head trying to figure out how to arbitrage this (like everyone else in the world.)  That explanation is the best one yet to explain the pricing differences.

This was the easiest multiple that I've since day trading back in '99.
How could you not just sit down and make a ton of money.

Good for you, OP, using the word properly.  If it offends anyone...please look it up.  Our language has many great, specific, words.

If you link a credit card to your account you can get authorized for instant purchases.  I think I can get like ten at a time.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:59:37
Sorry you missed your chance.  If it goes back to ten, you won't even have a paper note to show your grand kids.  But it probably won't.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:17:11
Just keep at it.  Some day, you will see something happening before your very eyes, and you will feel like the smartest guy in the room--because you know what is going to happen next.
A great feeling.

The system is jus spreading out, and it needs to find its equilibrium.  As more people come into the system and the coins get spread out, the madness will settle down.  Then as more merchants come on line, the velocity of the system will pick up.
But that is going to take a while.
The flaw I see in the system is the size of the coin.  As this thing goes over $1,000 per people will need to get used to splitting them up and dealing with, what Americans would refer to as change.  It's not real--it's in their minds.  But I wonder if that's going to be an issue.

I have been out of the bank for a few years, but it used to go something like this:
Cash transactions over $10k WOULD generate a report.
Cash transactions under $10K during a period that appear to be structured to avoid generating a report could generate a report.
Wires were all reviewed and since they were all recorded, reviews could be generated at any time the bank saw them as "suspicious."
The point is, if you have bitcoin transactions coming into your account, you should keep pretty good records that show the opening transactions and be able to account where THAT cash came from.
If you are honest and pay your taxes, it will take about ten seconds for the FBI and/or IRS to clear you.
The whole "reporting" thing sounds scary.  But if you have a legitimate reason for it, its not scary.  I know someone that found tens of thousands of dollars in a dead relative's home.  They were depositing $10K one day, $20K the next.  They were honest with the bank and on the estate taxes.  Nothing ever came of it.

They are buying the Litecoins, etc. because people feel they are more "affordable" and they can get a better return.
Affordable is a relative term.  I think I would rather have BTC than the others.  
Back in the day there used to be an investing technique called the "Gorilla Game."  You would invest in a group of stocks all purporting to serve the same market.  Take Yahoo, AOL, and Google for web search.  You would buy shares of each, and over time the "Gorilla" would emerge and you would sell off the losers and go with the winners.
That is what is happening in today's altcoin market.  Simply based on capitalization, I think the Gorilla has already been declared.

Yes.  Discretion is always wise.

My point was that if he cashed them out, he would be liable for income tax--if he was in the US--on the capital gain.

This is only an issue if you play fast and loose with your taxes.  
If you are an experienced business person, you track your expenses accurately you won't have an issue.
Trust me.  I own a small business and I had the IRS up my rear end last year.  They track EVERYTHING and they know how to find the smallest error.
If you are not doing this well, stay out of business.  Sloppiness will cost you dearly.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:45:11
Call you tax accountant.  If you are in the US, you dont have $130K.  You have about 1/2 of that after taxes.  Still, not a bad return.  Good for you.

Here is the conclusion that we should all keep in mind:
"Should bitcoin become widely accepted, it is unlikely that it will remain free of government intervention, if only because the governance of the bitcoin code and network is opaque and vulnerable. That said, it represents a remarkable conceptual and technical achievement, which may well be used by existing financial institutions (which could issue their own bitcoins)"
If it gets popular, the loser kids we all want to avoid will get involved.
