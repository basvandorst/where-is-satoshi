The amount of panic here is hilarious, has no one experienced websites being temporarily down before? Has no one experienced non-standard 404 pages before? Grow the fuck up people, the money you have on there was "spent" the moment you started trading it.

Ive honestly kept 3 btc in an online exchange for over a year now. Theyre sitting at btc-e currently. when I bought the coins I was already willing to loose the money so if they go missing then fuck it.

By "spent" I mean that if you have your money in BTC and are going to daytrade it you should consider it gone in the sense that you may make a bad trade or two, or the market does something unfavorable. I suppose spent wasn't the best choice of wording in this case.
It would be akin to putting money into a high risk investment, you should never bank on getting 100% of that money out. Daytrading is fun though, albeit frustrating at times, I did not mean to discourage people from using Bitstamp.

Yup. Exact same with me. Uploaded my utility bill and photo ID. They said my ID image was bad (it was, my fault), uploaded a new one and have not heard back since. I emailed support and got no response twice. It's been a week or longer. I've since resorted to Coinbase and their credit card purchasing *shudders*

Any mention of a bubble on r/Bitcoin will get you downvoted to oblivion. Lets be honest here the price will nose dive at some point in the near future, so take off those rose tinted glasses and prepare to buy some cheap coins.

Uh Why? 3M USD?
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:22:07
Toss some coin into a Poloniex account, they've been alright so far. You can't withdraw/deposit USD there, unfortunately, just crypto.

You should try day trading the alt coins instead. There's alot more movement in them and you can make some nice gains. Hit up your fav exchange and give it a try.

I miss chatting garbage into the trollbox on btc-e. You have to have 1k USD before you can talk now wtf!
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:23:34
Uhh.. if you sold and bought back in at the right time then why would you laugh? It's not a difficult thing to do, I made some easy gains when the price dipped...
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:07:35
I think youre right about a new bottom being 600-800. People know the value will rise back to 1200+ so we will have lots of people buying back in very quickly.

Stop saying hodl it sounds so fucking stupid

I have been trading on BitStamp and while I have made about 200 bucks in the past week, my overall number of BTC is going down cause Im terribad at timing. But that student loan isnt going to pay itself...

I don't understand the whole hype over holding your coins for years and years.
Yes I see that the early adopters are filthy rich but that's only because they started out by buying 10s or 100s of btc for cheap and now get to cash out. I bought 1.31btc at 600 yesterday and sold them today at 700. I will probably buy again when the price drops 40 or more then repeat the above until I have enough btc to hold onto for the long run.

This is hilarious... Read up on the jailbreak community please before opening your mouth

This man is correct, I've transferred btc from stamp to btce and there are no hassles to be had!

This would be great on a touchscreen, are there iOS and Windows RT etc versions coming?

Agreed, thanks for the insight!
