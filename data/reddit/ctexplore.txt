You're acting like banks are fully vested in this market lol. If a market can go up this fast why can't it come down as fast? This is just a healthy market correct to shake weak hands out. Just take a break and go outside we are fine.

Hey guys I thought it would be more appropriate to post on this discussion rather than make a post and spam. But I just started a new series on my websites opinion section called "Bitcoin Week Wrap Up." My main goal for this is to post weekly updates on where I see Bitcoin going a week in advance. It will also help drive traffic to my site which is called "Health, Wealth, &amp; Yourself" where my main goal is write posts on things I find entertaining and informative to YOU the reader.  I hope you guys can check it out and enjoy some of my content I have posted so far. It would mean a lot to me. If you like it share it with friends on Facebook that would be AWESOME! Anyways, thank you for reading, cheers!
Check out my first week wrap on Bitcoin and tell me what you think!

Yes, I agree with you, it all depends on this guys financial situation, but most importantly age. If this person is still in high school/college, I would say hold all and not worry about it for years. If this person is in their 20s + making let's say 30-40k a year, I would say sell half. And If he were making north of 50k+, I'd say sell 3/4, but ALWAYS hold at least one.

I'm just saying what I would do. Not trying to marry bitcoin right this moment in time because I feel there is still a little bit to go before we break new highs, but I am a believer long term. 4 BTC is a significant amount where selling a nice amount will give you a decent pile of cash making it worth it if bitcoin keeps falling. Imagine the people who did this at 15k+ they sold 1 BTC and can now afford 5. He was asking for advice, not just someone saying "hodl."

Sell three store 1. Price drops sub 3k, possibly low 2ks start dollar cost averaging in the 2ks (maybe we fall further), but at the same time you will hold one so if you were to miss a take off (which I don't see coming until 2020 at least) from FOMO you would at least have one full bitcoin with the upside of turning the 4 btc to 5+ depending on when we bottom

He is still HODLing one full bitcoin. Can't get greedy now my friend. Cash is still relevant in most transactions in this current financial state. Last I checked USD is still the world reserve currency. I am getting worried though about that. 21m coins holding one is significant when compared to world population. All we know it could drop to 0 (unlikely, but who's to say it can't?). How would he feel then?
