They should enable payments for the coin that shall not be spoken of too since coinbase has that on their platform as well. Downvote me.

money is something that can be stored and transfer that holds value. Gold, Silver, Platinum would do well . Buying things in say wheat or oil is a little more difficult.

This thread is actually good and could save others knowing many are in this same boat and it's ok to have missed the winning lotto ticket, stock or whatever. It's life, manias like this happen, stock market crashes happen. True wealth has nothing to do with money.

Many , many people are in this boat right now after missing the biggest bubble seen in $500 years. You/we are not alone, and it's ok. 
FWIW owned 1000 ETH  and sold at $13 after DAO hack.

The thing about wallstreet is they need the laws  to be pretty clear in order to invest in it. They are still not all in on pot yet because the fed laws are still iffy on it. That being said, pot is definitely kind of "mainstream" in certain parts of the country is it not? You get private equity and venture cap guys investing in these areas early, then big fund money comes in once the laws are clear cut.

I just want to be able to sell some silver or gold without ebay and paypal effing me with 13% in total fees. Hopefully this can gain some traction.

Bitcoin,a failed experiment over a few years, gold in a 4000 year uptrend. You know what to do.

I paid 84c for a transaction that took about an hour this week. That was my signal to exit BTC completely as the risk for me is some day not being able to get funds out.  A crash and too much transaction load, everyone is effed.

That's all fine and great on a sunday afternoon with low vol. What happens when a bunch of people need to hit the exit door in a short period?

Does bitcoin currently beat credit cards for speed ect. of course not. Never really has on the backend of it.  Does it still beat wiring money from point a to point b. Yes. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:56:32
Who benefits from this, (who's doing it?), and what can be done to solve this problem?  
I find it very interesting about the problem of HFT and Quote stuffing ect in the financial market's which is essentially spam, the way to get rid of that many have argued is a transaction tax or a tax/fee for canceling bogus orders. What are the solutions with bitcoin?

Bot $10k worth of  ETH at $10 watched it go to $20 then crash after DAO hack. Ended up selling at $13. Have been trading futures for 10 years and missed the biggest bubble of our time. Life. The fundamentals just didn't seem like they were great given Vlad Zamfir wrote that skeptical blog post about how cryptos are still experimental and not totally safe for critical apps ect. Polo and coinbase were seeming shady with deposit and withdrawals ect. Exchange risks ect just turned me off. Ah well.

So your definition of real money is "issued and fully controlled by a government". I think anything that is fungible can be real money. Gold, silver, Bonds, Corporate bonds, futures, stocks, fx, or a pile of class 5 gravel traded for a case of whiskey. 
"the assets, property, and resources owned by someone or something"

I'm not an expert here and have a question. When people say "oh no fees are going up," how much are they going up? Didn't someone send like an 80 million dollars worth transaction for  .04c on the bitcoin network once? How much are these fees going up ? Can't be that bad can it?

I'd love to sell some gold and silver on openbazaar considering ebay and paypal fees are 13% and kill that idea. Have a store already called Precious metals, search hashtag  Only have one piece as a test on there right now but will add more as openbazaar operation is running more smoothly.  
@_date: 2016-09-24 00:58:07
In fact I think many people from r/pmsforsale would like the idea of buying, selling, trading, on openbazaar once it runs more smoothly and is user friendly. Those ebay fees killed the metals market place on ebay. That would be one of the main items that can be sold on openbazaar that gives it an edge IMO.

You can either find a few other big players and try to negotiate a deal if you know they are trying to sell. Otherwise if you are going on exchanges then find the highest daily volume exchanges, and start buying every so often at each exchange, but you don't want to spook the market into thinking there is a huge buyer so you might want to sell 1000 at market then buy 3000 once the small fish stops start getting triggered :) Or set an algo to buy every 10 min or 15 min or whatever, Then switch up the intervals so front runners can't front run.
