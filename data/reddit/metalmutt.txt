Not to Intel.

Or they could just make a block chain that includes no transactions, so long as they maintain 51% the longest blockchain will always be empty, effectively shutting down the network.

Honestly, all I know about Toronto I learned from [Canadian Bacon](

DAE taxes are theft?
This subreddit would be better if people stopped posting worthless images with no content.

If bitcoin experiences exponential growth (which it has been) then so will the blockchain. Just what don't you get about [exponential growth](

Is there anything that would prevent someone from just bouncing 100s of transactions (above .01 BTC, to avoid fees) between wallets 24/7, causing the block chain to grow alarmingly fast?
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:25:21
That's the obvious interpretation to me. When I saw the logo I thought it was a joke about aborting fiat. (Which makes sense if you follow the rhetoric on this sub)

If you're going to correct someone at least learn to read.

[The wiki implies differently]( it says clients/miners only discriminate against size (must be bigger than 0.01 BTC, less than 10k bytes, has a high enough priority, which increases over time) 
@_date: 2013-05-12 15:53:34
Aren't they really only 159-bytes long? Step 4 of the [address generation algorithm]( pads the front of the address with `0x00`. Will the padding number change over time or is it basically set in stone?

To take in mind that article is basically worthless for you, Toronto isn't in America :P

Floods of people leaving MtGOX

Yes, they can loan out more than they have.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:04:56
Yes. It was a joke.

He *has* 1 BTC. That's money in his had. He can spend it anywhere that accepts it.

This has nothing directly to do with bitcoin, but the accounts of GT Guard have been frozen (and they likely won't ever see their funds again, at least not for a very long time)

This is we're used to ~100 dollar swings in a day. Letting the market "take time to adjust" just isn't something we do yet.

I knew the girlfriend of one of the founders of Gliph. (She was the librarian at my high school). It's cool to see how the product is growing. I might pick it up again.

There's no trail unless you can prove who was in control of a wallet at the time of the transaction. So long as you transfer your coins to a dummy account before you spend them they are untraceable.

DAE taxes are literally rape?
[Sorry: Maybe I should your guys's more refined version of making a point.](
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:01:12
Yeah, I know they have good intentions and are probably not going to run away with my money, but no way are you going to get most people to trust a service like that. People want to be able to buy things for themselves.
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:48:31
[At least try to research this]( They accept bitcoin the same way everyone else (reddit, etc) accepts it. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:22:08
Looks like they haven't fooled anyone yet [
