I was confused by this. I thought 3 confirmations was considered a lot, and 6 confirmations hugely secure.

I don't think you understand liquidity. We simply don't have much of it yet.
@_date: 2016-01-29 01:36:58
You realize that hard forks were anticipated by Satoshi, right?
@_date: 2016-01-29 01:45:03
I guess we'll see what happens

Your prideful lack of understanding is baffling to me.
If 75% of hash power, including ALL MAJOR EXCHANGES, choose a particular branch of a chain - the remaining 25% are fucked unless they join. You won't be able to convert your OldBitcoin to dollars. The dominos will fall in less than a day, probably a few hours from the fork happening. For all intents and purposes there will be one chain, except for maybe a few hours.
75% is not a probability. You only need 51% for market pressures to cause convergence on one branch of the chain (whichever one is longest). If 75% of hash power is on board, you have a guaranteed 99+% chance of everything going pretty damn smoothly.

It is a cesspool. I also went over there for some time and have found myself back here. Not because I don't prefer Classic's roadmap (or some hybrid between Classic and Core), but because the discussion is so one-sided and awful.
Things seem to have improved here some in the past month. It's still not great, but dare I say it is better than @_date: 2016-02-25 19:59:56
Spot on analogies.
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:47:48
It's also important that your offline wallet considers what happens if there's a fire, or if you die. These are all things traditional banks protect you against. I think people forget this when they consider the risk.

Few disagree that SW is awesome. Many disagree that it is ready for primetime and will solve the short term issue with acceptable risk. Classic will merge SW when it's fully tested.

One of many narratives you can paint based on the price movement. To illustrate this, you could also say that the price drop was due to the uncertainty caused by Mike Hearn's post and/or educating the market on how unlikely a block size increase is in the near future. The consolidation from that movement and the subsequent rise also syncs up pretty well with classic's PR momentum. Only 20 pts of the last 70 sync up with the release of Core's roadmap. Not saying that didn't contribute (it removed some uncertainty from the market, so it's likely), but I'm just pointing out that your view of what's moving the market's feels very confirmation-bias-y.


I'm kind of sick of people on both sides of this argument assuming the worst about the other side. I believe that both sides honestly want Bitcoin to succeed and have no hidden or evil agenda. Classic has valid arguments and concerns. So does Core. This is complicated. Inflaming the discussion by painting the other side is evil only harms the community and Bitcoin.

You can reverse trades on the stock market, too.  What you can't reverse is bitcoin transactions... But this is MtGoxBTC we're talking about, not BTC.

Why not just use a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet? Encrypting the scan with Truecrypt seems unnecessary if you do that.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:35:36
How many pool operators make 51%?
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:26:17
Remind me why this is bad?
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:47:21
Doesn't a hard fork of the block chain happen when a new version of the mining software is released? Everybody who is legit would have to agree to download the compromised version. That wouldn't happen.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:06:01
That's just a dumb thing to say. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:48:29
It's cute that you don't understand how whales liquidate positions. Fair enough that they wouldn't do it as I described - they'd wait for good/bad news and absorb it. There's PLENTY of volume for this and if you watch the order book and depth charts you can see it happening in front of your eyes.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:34:26
Great explanation, thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:05:04
Can this be incorporated into Bitcoin or would it require an altcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:05:50
What are you even talking about? And how would anybody know? All I'm saying is you can see people unloading huge positions if you read the order flow.
@_date: 2013-12-25 08:34:41
So are they using the same trick as huobi or is this some other breakthrough? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:04:04
Ummm....... What?
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:46:47
Don't see how you can draw that conclusion. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:13:37
Is it conceivable that pool marketshare could have a ceiling? What other solutions are there that could be built into the protocol? 
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:06:31
What happens when different people are using different clients? Are there any consequences of that?
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:21:33
Could that be engineered into a future version?
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:22:44
No you don't. localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:23:22
Meh.  Wouldn't be that hard to unload 10k coins over a week or two on an exchange. If you have 100k+ there's always Goldman sachs... 
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:04:00
Take control of the network? Isn't the network just thousands of individual miners? What would happen in a malicious take over? 
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:58:51
Does the US government need to do this considering the black market busts where they seize bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:47:17
Who could that possibly benefit? 
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:55:58
Great read...  You're a great writer. One thing I didn't see in the book was any mention of Armory. How do your paper wallet methods on Electrum compare? Also is there a difference between a paper wallet and a paper backup? I've been trying to figure that out.  Thanks for your contribution! 
@_date: 2013-12-25 03:16:35
Uh, no. From a speculator's point of view, yes. From a currency point of view, there are myriad benefits for them.
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:45:22
Or they're just moving funds to a new wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:37:32
Why would it?
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:38:02
Ahhhhh. Brilliant!
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:21:13
There are ample ways to launder Bitcoins.  Google it. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:37:47
Help me out here... I see where it says this:


Where I'm stuck...
1. So if I'm to understand that correctly, the public key of the recipient is not visible in the block chain. I don't quite get how the recipient can claim the funds then.
2. Does this mean that there could potentially be large amounts of unaccounted for bitcoins out there? For example, could there be someone missing from the [BitcoinRichList]( who has taken this precaution?
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:56:51
Wonder what the odds are they picked the name to get acquired by Square down the road. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:53:00
Settle down there. This is non news. They basically just said it's risky (it is) and unregulated (it is). Honestly it was pretty responsible of them to make this announcement given more citizens hearing about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:45:22
What is a realistic scenario where a 51% attack could hurt Bitcoin? For example, could a 0day virus infect 51% of bitcoin-qt users, allowing a malicious party to set a new rule?
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:26:26
Wow.  Thanks for posting. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:08:41
Wow. This looks like one clusterfuck of an altcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:37:49
I mean bitcoins, not dollars. Look at the order book. If you dumped like 10 coins every  5 minutes thats 120 coins an hour. Let's assume you only do it during the highest volume 8 hours of the day. That's 960 coins a day. Let's assume you only do it on weekdays. That's 4,800 coins a week, or $3.5 million. If you need to dump more than that per week, well, first world problems I guess. You could do even more by arbing your own trades on different exchanges.
