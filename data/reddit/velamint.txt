Since when? I thought banks are a business where they store your money so they can loan it to others and profit from the interest. One where small balances (typical of inactive accounts) cost them money in accounting and regulation.
Keep in mind, they are a business and they do this for profit. This isn’t the government who does it for societal good.

They have to do annual reporting/accounting. Imagine how many accounts they would have if they never closed them?
Honestly - the OP forgot about money for 12 years and it’s the banks fault?

Banks have to send in regulatory compliance reporting to the government. It isn’t just a few bytes of data it is millions of accounts with reporting and compliance. 
At the high end of the fed rate (2.5%) the bank is earning $32/yr (after reserve ratio requirements) and for this they have to maintain debit cards/fraud risk, maintain online access, send out statements (online only wasn’t common 12 years ago), and report to the government.
A bank isn’t a charity, I wouldn’t service that type of customer if I had a business, would you?

It is profitable if they have an overdraft fee here or there or use their debit card with ~1% service fee, or pay ATM fees, or grow their balance and start using other services.

If you ran a business would you spend money to find and confirm someone to spend money to close an account that is loosing money for us? Or would you say it is the customers responsibility to keep their information up to date - per the terms and conditions - sent out a letter and be done with it.
Finding someone that owes you money has value (expectation of getting paid back)
What doesn’t make sense here? Not sure what “really easy” is but that isn’t free and if you close 10k accounts a year are you going to pay someone 2h to find and confirm an identity (hire 20 people) vs automated system?

Who is suggesting a bank (or any public business) shouldn’t make decisions primarily on finance/money? Banks are not governmental organizations - they are business. Why would we apply different expectations (around operating for profit) than McDonalds?
At least both banks and McD are regulated (to some extent) by the government- although I think some of those regs were recently rolled back (prior to latest election)

They sent me 2 letters, (I know one was at 30 days out) on one of our inactive accounts but we took care of it before the final date. If you don’t have the right mailing address on your account how are they supposed to contact you? At 12 years it was probably mailed to his parents house and could have been tossed with junk mail.
