BitCoin's value is extremely unstable. It's not unreasonable to think that this is a bubble, and a risky investment.

Thank you. I had read it before but my memory is abysmal and I had forgotten.
To clarify, you are talking about Simplified Payment Verification, correct?

*Relying* on eWallets like that significantly undermines the purpose of BitCoin. Your balance in each of them is essentially a separate centrally-managed currency that is interoperable with BitCoin-at-large.

I feel like you are being disingenuous here. [People]( [often]( talk of BitCoin as being a large potential threat to the existing currency systems, which requires a large degree of scalability. I rarely see this issue brought up in discussions of those articles.

The assumption that anyone genuinely expressing doubts about the system must be a CIA operative is sufficiently absurd that you must either be a troll or a overzealous conspiracy nut. I wonder which it is...

How resilient is it, then?
From an individual perspective (not looking at the system-at-large), a careless user can have their entire balance wiped out due to a hard drive failure. If something similar happens to your bank balance there are ways to resolve your issue; for BitCoin that's impossible.

I have seen the same issue discussed in a few places, and I also feel that it has never been properly resolved. It is my greatest concern for BitCoin, which I am otherwise very excited about. Many people on the forums have approached it as a problem to be dealt with when it arrives. I strongly disagree with this.
If nobody has suggested a viable solution yet it suggests that the problem is at least nontrivial. As such, it is negligent to wait for it to grow before putting serious effort into investigating solutions. For a currency to be stable people need to have confidence in it, and unresolved issues like this will undermine that.
Additionally, people often represent large changes to the fundamental implementation of BitCoin as something that's doable without too much effort. I read talk of having multiple networks interoperating as people transition from one system to the next. This strikes me as another issue which isn't being dealt with in sufficient depth. Although such as thing is certainly technically possible, there are possible problems, such as a lack of use on the old network causing the available computing power to drop significantly; I'm not knowledgeable enough to discuss the consequences this could have, but it seems like it could cause problems. I also think that such a change is the sort of thing that would confuse or worry enough people to damage confidence in BitCoin.
I doubt that these problems are insurmountable. However, dismissing them as minor seems like a very counterproductive approach; the community needs to have seriously discuss these issues in advance to be able to deal with them properly.

They'd undermine the cryptography that BitCoin relies on, neh?
@_date: 2011-03-31 08:04:33
Are they major?

"We all" may not be correct, but I do think it it is a fair description of the most widely-expressed view in the community. You are being unconstructively pedantic.
