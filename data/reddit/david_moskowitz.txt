It seems that for the first minute or two after a block is found and the headers sent the miner mines empty blocks. 
Then as they build a new block with transactions, they include transactions at an an incremental rate. 
However- it doesnt explain the 30min gap with no additional transactions. Hadn't seen that before.

Software can follow the trail of the inputs and outputs (change address), and connect you as the owner in many cases.  It could confuse things slightly if you spent some of the coins with unidentifiable addresses.

I havent had a chance to try the numoni terminals yet. I did $50 + $2's at tembusu, and $10 + $2 at btc exchange in city link. Both were quick and easy to use.
I think part of Numoni's mission is to provide an option for the unbanked. To allow migrant workers another option to send money back home. Hence the small sums.

Bitpay is still a trusted 3rd party
As a consumer I trust that if a merchant screws me on a shipment, bitpay will look into it for me.
As a merchant, I trust that bitpay will pay me the fiat I am supposed to get.
BUT the great thing about bitcoin is you get to decide the level of trust you require.

Thanks- my jaw dropped when the accountant told people to buy bitcoin offshore.... There goes the local jobs and innovation.
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:29:09
Very clear example of double taxation... Taxes paid on the beer and then the bitcoin as a transaction mechanism when converted to cash... 
Way around this is to sell the bitcoin abroad or use the bitcoin received to purchase supplies from abroad.
There goes the development of your local bitcoin industry and GDP growth.
Example 7: A business accepts bitcoin from a consumer
29. Lupulin Lounge Inc operates a craft beer bar that accepts bitcoin as payment. Danya, who is not registered for GST, buys a glass of beer that is priced at $6.60. Danya asks to pay in bitcoin, and Lupulin converts the $6.60 to an amount of bitcoin using the current bitcoin exchange rate and accepts Danya's bitcoin.
30. Lupulin has a similar arrangement to that described in Example 6 and has arranged to have any bitcoin received converted straight to Australian dollars by an Australian bitcoin seller.
31. Lupulin has made a taxable supply of beer on which GST is payable. Lupulin cannot claim input tax credits on the acquisition of bitcoin because Danya did not make a taxable supply of bitcoin to Lupulin. When Lupulin then converts the bitcoin to Australian dollars they received from Danya they have made a taxable supply of bitcoin on which GST is payable. 
then later
33. When Ashkir pays for the tablet with bitcoin, he is making a supply of bitcoin. The supply of bitcoin is connected with Australia because it is made through Ashkir's enterprise that is carried on in Australia. Ashkir determines that Tablets &amp; Phablets is not an Australian resident and is not in Australia in relation to the supply of bitcoin. Therefore, the supply of bitcoin by Ashkir is GST-free under item 2 of the table in subsection 38-190(1).

Yes, tembusu prints out and displays a private key to be scanned. The display of the key needs to be removed IMHO, and they should probably switch to scanning a public key. They said they have a few iterations under development- I'm sure they can customize as needed.

The purpose of this comparison is not the costs of using bitcoin vs cost of fiat. (I agree that at this point- it is expensive to use bitcoin as a means of exchange if you need to go back and forth into fiat-it was also expensive to use email in 1995 when I needed to by a pc to do it, or book computer time at a 'net cafe)
I agree on the risks of exchanges, and make sure to let people know about them. 
I operate an ATM here in singapore- no biometrics turned-on on this one, or any others that are located here. The ATM reduces the counterparty risk of holding cash and bitcoin on exchanges for the customer. I take that risk for them (part of the reason for the higher fees).
 
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:04:25
Isn't that how all news works? BTW- I also sent money privately before doing this video. I happened to be in the area of this ATM and thought it would be cool to shoot a video showing how you can now make donations via bitcoin, even if you don't normally use bitcoin.

How is a sidechain any different than an offchain transaction? (send your btc to an exchange for example) or altcoin?
If there's some POW/POS type mechanism on the sidechain, isn't this the same as exchanging your btc for an altcoin, but having the btc you sent have a locked value?
@_date: 2014-09-17 16:14:42
Thats not how it works. (I operate the robocoin machine in singapore)
You set the api for the exchange, and the amount of commission to charge on the bid/ask. Its not like a sports book where you set amounts to even out the bets and take the spread. It's an arbitrage play against the exchange price.

Asking them to make a twitter post. I originally contacted them via the website, the reply email is an  address.

Perhaps a 3-d model is required, showing node connections, and mining/pools, and core developers.

Sorry, the robocoin machine has been shipped off to europe. You can still buy online via my site coinrepublic.com
If you want to use an ATM to buy. Theres a lamassu machine at City Link near the city hall mrt.

I emailed them to find out more information on the supposed connections.
This is what I received back:
Lewis Sanders IV of dw.com is in possession of that data currently. He is the one who hired analysts to blockchain trace the funds. Just to highlight there is zero connection between Paris attackers and cryptocurrencies despite what you may have been reading.

Yes you can. You can also out NewsBTC shoddy reporting if you please as well. We would never endanger the cryptocurrency market with false claims as we are avid supporters of it.

Bandwidth, on high speed wifi (30+mbs up/down on speedtest).
Battery, leave plugged in.
Storage, micro-usb to usb external hard disk. (bootstrap the blockchain)
I'm ready to try this out!
edit- i see an issue, if using an external hard disk via micro usb, thats the power port...

A little late to publish... was supposed to go into a local tech blog back in Dec/Jan, but got filed away.

What about when company X wants to buy 1btc in order to use the blockchain for proof of existance? 
Is this a purchase of VC for a service?
Each Licensee must obtain the superintendent’s prior written approval for any plan or proposal to introduce or offer a new product, service, or activity, or to make a material change to an existing product, service, or activity, involving New York or New York Residents."
I don't see how they will keep up with innovation in the space.

Possible to also store the blockchain on a local network hd.

 "When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation." - Gresham's law
When people see bitcoin as undervalued, they save it.

How does the service recognize that that deposit matches that user account?

Speaking from experience in singapore with a service that allows buying/selling bitcoin- fraudsters will jump through the hoops, but they won't use their own IDs. They will use stolen ones. The selfie thing is to prevent this, but its only a matter of time before they get a hold of selfie'd ids too....

I started to write this a couple of months back, but got caught up with other projects.
I think the TOC covers most of the ground needed in the handbook, now for the hard part of the actual content ;)
Please contribute if you have a chance!

Been thinking about this as well. I have an old samsung s2, can plugin that into an external harddrive via the microusb. Just need an android version of bitcoin core!
Start a lighthouse for a build?

Just buy more btc when you spend it. Your savings won't be depleted and you are helping to spread the usage.

When calculating the paypal rate- it can get muddy. Is it an international order? thats a higher rate (~+1%). Are they converting from a local currency to US$ to pay you? then there's a currency conversion fee. (another 1-3%)

External mic was used- but there was too much background noise. I'll try to clean up the audio with software.

How many of those were s-dice, just dice back and forth, etc? Maybe a stat we dont wanna know... ;)

Heres something similar I built a few months ago.
Copy and paste javascript.
No graph though- I like your widget, nice job!

A lot of banks simply won't deal with American clients anymore. I know it took Steve a few tries to find one that did. 
I was lucky, I started up here in 2009, Banks were much more open to Americans back then.

My press release regarding this:
@_date: 2013-09-04 08:05:19
Nice pamphlet, but I think if you are targeting small businesses, you need to focus on how it will save them money over Credit Card fees, banking, and how it can attract new loyal customers- and get publicity for their business.
Also show how easy it is to add a bitcoin POS.
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:59:56
Agreed- i need bookkeeping for btc desperately. Hook into the API, even better. Either pull the trade data or initially do manual imports. For quickbooks, could be an online converter that I could then import using an iif file. Thats how I handle paypal transactions now.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:37:27
What software are they running? or is it proprietary?
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:43:34
Glad I'm not in the US then.

Trend Micro has confirmed that this website can transmit malicious software or has been involved in online scams or fraud.

I've run 2 of them for 10 days, earned 0.02973501 (in a pool). At $900 / btc thats 26.761509 * 3 / 2 = 40.14 a month per stick. (doesnt include electric cost) However, I don't think you would have expected this price!
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:35:13

Thanks again for the camera work!
I think the POS was made by the meetup organizer Tomas. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:25:41
Agreed- I think he will improve the interface to show it has been paid more clearly. I already gave some feedback on this.

Thanks for noticing :) Not sure if you call what I do at the moment a platform or brokering service.
MAS has said repeatedly they do not regulate virtual currencies, and that businesses are free to transact in Bitcoin. I presented on this as the last Meetup. I'll post a press release on this shortly.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:41:25
I think they sold out of them. Maybe releasing a 5gh version soon, if not already.

Very cool device. Why not also allow a QR code on the screen so those without the card can use a mobile bitcoin wallet?

When you withdraw like this, does it require an email confirmation?
Very concerned about api key security... any way to make this more secure, encrypt the key, make sure that the proper script is accessing it?

Was awesome to meet them in Singapore. Great couple with a fantastic story. Looking forward to the full documentary.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:06:47
Was great chatting about bitcoin. 
Got the miners running now- one at 2.13 gh, one at 2.32. Think they can go around 2.5 but I'm not running them at max efficiency. Had to use a USB cable on one as my laptop's USB ports are too close together.

Increasing SGD volume in Singapore, decreasing Mt.Gox or both?

Based on the rate- looks like they build the fee into the arbitrage.

Why not allow people to store USD$ on account, rather than having to do transfers in and out of the bank and pay fees? I'd be happy with keep $ with you guys and paying say 0.5% to get in and out on the site. Then another 0.5% to transfer in and out of the bank.
