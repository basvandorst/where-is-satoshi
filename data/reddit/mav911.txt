If the government can't borrow or lend it, it will never become a main currency. imho

Next week the CBOE bitcoin future will be 1 bitcoin.  The following week CME bitcoin future will be 5 bitcoins.  There brokerages (the  ones I spoke with) will not be allowing leverage until they get a fell to the market.  Also, there will be no initial shorting or future options.  The shorting and futures will come at a later date when they feel more comfortable with the market.  At a future date some brokerages will then allow 200%  of the 33% margining. 
It appears they are getting into the market slowly.

That is what I have been told and read up on.  I do not represent a brokerage, but go ahead I guess.  I've never been quoted before ;-)

I was in and out trying to pick highs and lows before.  Now I just HODL and am doing much better in the long run.  You will be fine in the long run.

Does anyone know how much Bitcoin Cash Coinbase is holding til Jan 1st?  That can take a large chunk out of the total Bth available.

It is like watching paint dry.  I have not had any of my transactions processed today.  ug

I'm there with you, waiting about 6 hours now.  Luckily they were smaller transactions.  I also sold some Btc on Coinbase which cashed out instantly.

BTC and BCH,  I am assuming he received recent access from the split way back yonder.  Still waiting on Coinbase access here. grrr

I would keep both.  It could be a win win with both going up.  One considered value storage the other considered a checkbook type spending account.  Not that you need to spend either one.

Hmmm, I wonder how many of those big addresses lost their keys many years ago thinking very little of what they had?
