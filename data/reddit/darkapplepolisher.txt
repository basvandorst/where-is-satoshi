But people would know that Person E won the auction. None of those people will be Person E. They just don't know who Person E is.
Therefore there is plausible deniability regarding Person E being in on the scam, or simply being a quiet winner.

If you're having a lack of ability to reach the digital world, I'm going to fathom a guess and say that you're not a bitcoin user.

Because a dedicated fraudster would totally have some issues making a facebook account with some fake info.

You're right, I can tell by your timely response that you must also have significant issues with finding a way with accessing the digital world as well.

You have a lot more tact than I do. I thought the idea of a physical magazine is pretty ludicrous myself.  This magazine is dedicated to a purely digital currency, for crying out loud. Physical media is for oldbies.
Well, they're in the business of making magazines and I'm not, but I'm very curious to hear this explanation as well.

As someone who has made some inaccurate statements in the past, when it's followed by a strong counter argument, I think it's really nice when I get a few upvotes, since it brings the response higher on the page and improves the intellectual value of the conversation as a whole.

Unless you have an uncommon/rare fetish, and you've consumed literally all publicly available porn for it. I'm pretty sure I've recycled all of my vids at least 20 times a piece.

So, I'm a bit bearish on the long-term health of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general specifically because of this subject matter.
While we can agree that segwit2x is an immediate acceleration to centralization, I want to know your thoughts on how long you think it will take to reach this end if the community continues maintaining smaller blocks. As I see it, it's not a question of *if* consumer grade networks will be pushed out of the market, but instead *when*.
