Or you could just accidentally throw your hard drive with your wallet in the trash.  You can accidentally burn your house down.  Shit happens and shit will continue to happen.  Monetary cost is not a shield from reality.
Your literally telling me that if someone befalls tragedy, it is their own fault.  You should read up on the 'Just World Fallacy'

Although this would be literally 'printing more money'.
This signifies a dying economy when fiat does it and I'm sure it would mean the same with bitcoin.

So what policy do they have on withdrawals?
If I put money in my account and then buy bitcoin can't I send that coin to a private wallet?  Or are we just talking about leftover fiat currency being stuck in your account.

A plugin approach is essentially what I'm suggesting.  Not sure what you mean by 'repackaging all the different wallets". You have a  different wallet for each blockchain anyway, no matter what client you use.
If the wallets indicate which blockchain they belong to then there should be no problem.  All you would need is a plugin to incluse all relevant information belonging to that blockchain.
As a side note: do all cryptos have ~8GB blockchains? So for each bitcoin-qt you have going it adds 8GB to your system (not to mention the download)? 
It would be nice if a lighter client like Electrum would implement what I'm suggesting. So much easier.

I agree. It's been a few days and it's already considered a flop?  I have no idea where this bullshit is coming from but I would expect better from this lot since Bitcoin wasn't exactly a powerhouse in its first week.

And yet we need to know who is licensed/qualified to drive vehicles, hunt, practice medicine, etc., etc.  This is already publicly available information and for a good reason.
We can't escape ID that tracks this information, we can only make it efficient and remove the illusion that this information was ever 'secret' to begin with.
I don't see your point of how one blockchain-based ID system is any more oppressive than the dozens of ID systems that already exist and whose information is already publicly available.

They'll muddy the water enough so your common consumer will think its the same as bitcoin.  They'll say 'blockchain' and the consumer will say "Oh. its bitcoin.".
Only good making it editable will do is let the banks hide their illegal dealings with drug cartels and other clients who want to hide their wealth.

My definition of right and left wing politics is the same one held by political scientists everywhere and they are both found on wikipedia.  
* 
* 
Short definition:
* Left Wing:  Defines and encourages individual rights and freedoms.
* Right Wing: The existence of a ruling minority is natural and should be maintained at the cost of the individual rights and freedoms.
No other definitions exist.
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:17:33


@_date: 2019-01-09 23:47:12
List occasions where the right wing have taken power away from the powerful and supported individuals with no rights.
Should not be a problem is the right are the champions of liberty.
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:06:28
The definitions didn't change.  The people who write textbook are more educated than you. You are wrong. I'm going to assume you know you are wrong because the alternate is just too sad.
Being in violation on the law and being punished by it because you harassed trans people doesn't make you a left-winger, it makes you a criminal.  NO ONE is allowed to harass or threaten people to the degree the law has to get involved for ANY reason.  The fact that it has gotten so BAD that they had to make protected status a thing so misdemeanors get upgraded to felonies are indicative of the soullessness and relentlessness of the harassers and it is not indicative of any flaws in the victims.
If you simply want protected status to disappear then just stop committing hate crimes.  They had to be enacted just to deal with right-wing terrorism.  No one wants to be a protected class.  Being a protected class means statistically someone will beat the shit out of you at some point just for what you are, no sin committed.  No one wants that reality.
I know right-wingers make victims of people a lot so when they complain I can understand how they might link complaining to being a lefty. Trust me, getting awarded something to complain about doesn't change your place on the political spectrum.
As for businesses not catering to you anymore, by all means march into your local legislature and demand SEVERE limitations on corporate power and make them answerable to the needs of ALL of their customers.  Go ahead.
As for the cake thing:  Do you think a business should be allowed to discriminate against whites?  Answer Yes, and no one will believe you.  Answer No, and you negate your own complaint.  Discrimination is bad for all.
If you feel 'left-wing' now then BY ALL MEANS practice what they preach and rob corporations of their power.  Make government more transparent and be serious about it.  Make sure to demand Trump's tax returns like a true lefty.
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:44:54
Left Wing:  Give power to the powerless by making government support and protect the rights of the many and use the collaborative power of government to keep costs of living down, encouraging the spread of ideas and (increasingly) protecting the environment.
Right Wing:  Give power to the powerful and ensure government only serves them.   Leave the powerless desperate to make ends meet, eventually making indentured servitude the only option to pay your debts.  The powerful will make indentured servitude seem like a moral necessity by saying it's a failure of personal responsibility, and not proof of a system rigged against the majority.  Also, destroying the environment and inevitably killing off the species for no reason.

It is not a brainwallet.  
This wallet is from my Virtex account.
Using Ubuntu Linux and Windows 7.
It may not be a large amount but I should make sure that the wallet is safe, that I'm taking necessary precautions, and that I am not compromised in any way before I start doing large amounts of BTC.
I don't want to bum for BTC but if someone could send me 0.0001 BTC we can check if someone takes it.
That being said, is it possible to delete a compromised wallet from an online service? I don't think many online services let you label your wallets and certainly not delete them.
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:23:49

Thanks.  Virtex did show me having 0.0002 BTC in my account so I think that's the culprit.  Didn't realized there was a 'sweep' function,  though I'm not sure what the purpose of it is.
@_date: 2013-11-02 12:36:58
It's my first Virtex wallet, so not my software.  Pretty much gave all the information I could.
I THINK the website I went to was CoinTube.tv but don't quote me on that.
@_date: 2013-11-02 13:21:51
I think that is is fact what happened.  Virtex did show I had a 0.0002 BTC balance.  It won't let me move anything to my private wallet though because of the withdrawal limit.  I'll remember to use a private for stuff like that from now on.
So a 'sweep' is the culprit.  That is a load off my mind.

Can you delete your account if the balance is 0?
EDIT: Also, what if you have an amount if BTC lower than their minimum withdrawal limit.  I have 0.002 in my wallet but their minimum withdrawal is 0.01
