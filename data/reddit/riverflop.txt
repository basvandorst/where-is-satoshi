Just down vote these brainless scammers

Lol what a shitty company. A bank telling their employees how to spend money. I will ban banks who charge exorbitant fees for money transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:24:58
Great idea, now I just need to harvest 44,000 humans.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:56:01
A bit strange to imply it's hacked when you can't even login.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:42:12
Then where has the Bitcoin payment option gone?   
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:37:30
You need to relax and stay away from CMC or any portfolio apps, enjoy your life and before you know it you will have doubled your investment. People are so damn impatient these days. Did you believe in BTC when you put your money in it? Then why don't you still... All the negative news in the past weeks that affected the price of cryptocurrencies turned out to be fake.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:08:13
I'm pretty sure that was your point ��
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:35:16
It's not there anymore...

Unlikely, probably more like $28,784.69 at March 5th 15:48:05 GMT+1

It's great news, it's a clear message to countries there are no legal grounds to ban cryptocurrency and that it can merely be regulated. Of course it was inevitable for governments to ban anonymous accounts, they risk missing out on billions worth in taxes. Bad news for people who are evading taxes but big news for cryptocurrency on the long run.

What is the impact of a bitcoin mining ban going to be on Bitcoin? Decentralisation?
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:31:08
I know plenty of people who already got their money back through mtgox claims on Kraken. They got credits they could use to buy crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:19:11
You're asking infor advice about getting rid of Bitcoin? I think ETH is still a great investment. It's good to note half of the coins in the top 100 run on Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:37:43
Yes but it's more than people paid for it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:13:30
Shit like this has me convinced that we will never be able to time travel. Surely there would be 1 person who would take 10,000 Bitcoin of his hands.
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:27:12
Subtle spam
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:34:11
Better ask their customer support. I think this needs to be changed manually after verification to prevent theft.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:04:35
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:39:30
70%. A bold statement, I know but I believe in the technology and it's potential to make fiat obsolete. WeChat in China is a good example.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:52:36
Good, it's the people who stopped giving f*cks who ended up becoming dirt rich. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:13:32
It is, bank have no rights to tell their employees what to do in their spare time. I think this reaffirms the need for cryptocurrency as banks just want to control everything.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:05:33
You just proved my point, thank you! 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:20:06
Amazing, who would have thought 3 months ago that we would reach $10,000 today. To the moon!
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:35:46
You do know that people who lost BTC in the hack were able to get their money back?
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:52:50
Congrats. Good to hear! 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:24:25
Just a correction, it will probably settle around 15-15.5k. If you're constantly watching Bitcoin then you're doing it wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:46:52
Looks fake because it is supposed to say "Redeem Bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:17:45
Alt coins happened. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:11:50
No doubt, just 0.1% of the population has bought cryptocurrencies yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:41:03
You weren't hacked, hackers rarely go through the hassle of changing someones password. They simply steal your money and leave. This sounds like a 2FA issue.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:22:12
Did you file a claim?
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:13:14
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:40:36
Should have called it Bonero.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:40:00
Can anyone tell me where I can buy with Bitcoin? It looks like they completely removed this option: 
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:18:21
Did you even apply? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:09:00
Coins signify GDAX sell offers ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:35:31
I'm glad there are subtitles!
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:17:13
I think Ripple, Stellar Lumens and other coins that are shooting to the moon have caught Bitcoin investor's interest.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:40:52
I sure hope not ;D I honestly think 40,000 is more likely than 10,000
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:53:54
With the current volume, it is super unlikely the coin will crash by 50%. I think worst case scenario is a 30% correction but even that is unlikely. People know that there is very little impact from futures on the market so if it were to have a correction, it will be no more than 10% and will bounce back to record heights shortly after.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:49:45
Bitcoin will succeed because of mass adoption, mass development support (developers making lots of progress to address scaling and cost issues). Other coins that will likely do super well are obviously Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, Ark. Also keeping my eyes on; NXT, EOS, Litecoin, OmiseGO, Stellar Lumens and who knows Cardano when they actually build a working product ;P If bitcoin were to crash it would definitely take all the altcoins with it and it would take a bit for the altcoins to recover. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:27:17
17 Bitcoins by now
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:39:28
I doubt, word of mouth is way more effective than advertising.

Well alright then. bitcoin-tipper! tip 0.5 btc

The original Silk Road? (120 BCE – 1450s CE) I didn't know Bitcoin has been around for that long.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:17:39
No, it's fine, just always keep a copy of the private keys on paper. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:17:16
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:48:16
Yes, it's a sacrifice made to the cryptogods.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:00:32
Yes please!
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:30:54
Any estimates on the cost (cost of all units and electricity) and profits of such a setup?

I would buy heat ledger but it only supports batcoins
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:28:01
Fake news, there were only a handful of instances where people got their accounts frozen. There are about 100,000 crypto investors in Australia and only a few people accounts were frozen likely due to false positive marked as money laundering.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:00:36
He has a good point, Bitcoin is not much of a currency YET. Rome wasn't built in a day either, right now there is a really good foundation but in the future when Bitcoin is more accessible, stable and more adopted it will be the perfect currency. The example he uses about the risks of cryptocurrency just as well apply to fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:41:22
No problem :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:34:50
It won't directly affect the price but more publicity will result in a higher demand and a higher price. It also gives bitcoin more credibility. Expect an unprecedented increase in value in the days to come, possibly 25-30K.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:58:02
Lol! You do realize people have been posting Mario memes on this subreddit for years. I copied this one from a post of September:

Some things are better stored off chain because they take up a lot of space this can be done by adding a link or another layer to store big amounts of data without clogging the chain. Currently the blockchain is already 150gb.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:51:43
Every single time :D
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:48:23
I agree, the rivalry is hurting both and could mean the demise of both BTC and BCH. If Roger Ver can stop claiming his coin is Bitcoin and duping people in buying the wrong coin then everything is fine.

I don't like it when you call it Apple Unlimited, we are the real Apple.The original Apple is Apple Legacy.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:13:31
The network is less congested now so fees will be lower, $30-50 fees are not unheard of, especially when multiple orders are needed to match a bit order.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:13:42
It's a really stupid thing to do, he has been suppressing the value of his own coins. If he sold 10 BTC a day, Bitcoin would be worth double or triple of what it's worth now.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:16:18
In case you didn't notice, this is photoshopped
