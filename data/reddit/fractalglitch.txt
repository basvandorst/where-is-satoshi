I'm pretty sure that changing btc to cash at every single tx will cost more to them.  Steam is not a corner store, they don't pay 1% fee. People in this subreddit seems to think that it is somehow free to accept btc. 
As long as company will convert there btc instead of respending them, a true economy will not be sustainable. It's cool and all that they decide to accept them... a few years late... but now we congratulate buisness that do buisness with them. Not just simply accepting it in lieu of usd. 
And chargeback, even if you take btc, you are still legaly required to reimburse customers. 
Fraudulent chargeback is another thing of course.

This comment IS IMPORTANT and can't be upvoted enough.
Few people was there before pizza guy/when was Satoshi was around and I find that people have a HARD TIME understanding what was going on back in the day and what the bitcoin community was.
Bitcoin WAS NOT a financial product... AT ALL. In their most wildest dream, people saw bitcoin as a 1 BTC = 1 USD thing with SUPER limited payment application revolving around micropayment (don't let the actual Bitcoin Core developers fool you; micropayment WAS the  use case for Bitcoin back in the days, and no, nobody talked about sidechains or said that bitcoin "was not ready yet" for micros).
Pizza guy literally kick started the Bitcoin ecosystem as payment and he might be the  reason, beyond Satoshi, why it is successful today. There was a clear demarcation in peoples mind between the pre and post-pizza era.
Pre-pizza, people would send thousands of BTC to total strangers that asked for them to play with on the internet. Post-pizza is where people started to understand and hold.
Also, pre-pizza, bitcoin was a fun project revolving around cryptography but nobody believe in it. Few people had hundreds of thousands of bitcoin. For them, ANY value was awesome as it was pretty much infinite financial performance. Most sold at 10$ for hundreds of thousands, some sold at 100$ and a few select still have them.
You know why I still have most of my early bitcoin? I totally forgot about Bitcoin while it was exploding between nothingness to 100$. I woke up one day and on some tech news show they were talking about that new thing bitcoin was being traded for 100$. The hard drive that contained the wallet broke a while back and I had to send the hard drive to a recovery service (it was well worth it even at 100$). I was highly considering selling it all at 100$ but during the recovery process it mooned from about 100$ to about 600$. That's when I realized I wasn't selling shit until at least then next 4 generation of my children can live off the revenue. I'm it for the long run, it is definitely an "all or nothing" situation and I realize that.

Of course, that's the idea. We allow Mastercard or Visa to be aware of our credit report so that every vendor where we go doesn't have to know and thus protect our privacy.
Why would coinbase want to know our credit report so we can buy on their site with our credit card. They don't trust Visa or what is going on?

I am not sure that rebroadcasting indefinitely is the best way to do it as miners won't add it to their blocks as long as the priority is not high enough. Also, if we do this, the network will become more prone to ddos attack as we make it basically free to fill up all full node memory pool (spending 1 satoshi every tx until your 100btc is up or whatever or even respending the same satoshis in increasly complex tx that are larger and larger) 
I believe their is a few fix to that problem that work together that needs to be implemented to repair this:
1- make damn well sure that no wallet users send incorrect fees with their transaction unless in "hardcore expert mode"  like Armory implement or in manual tx. This need to be dynamically adjusted according to the network current state.  Most wallet already have that feature but it is too easy to change the suggested fee. 
2-we need to give the ability to user to specify an expiry date on their tx. If the tx is not in a block by that time, all miners and full node simply forget that tx ever existed. This does not increase possibility of double spending. 
3- we need to add a subsidiary to full node operator, no matter how small it is. It is becoming increasingly expensive to operate a full node (my node cost me about 20$ a month in bw, HD space and computing space and it is on an already paid for dedicated server. 
4- we need to implement partial node that don't have the full ledger but that know that the ledger was in state X at block height Y and build on this, thus removing hd space need and initial synchronization time. 
5-INCREASE THE DAMN BLOCK SIZE. IF WE CANT USE THE NETWORK WITH HIGHER THAN NORMAL FEES, IT IS USELESS.

You are invested in Bitcoin since last summer and you really think you know what's best for it? You really investigated both side of the issue, without prejudice?
You sat down with people that are here from 2009 or 2010, maybe 2011 and listened to what we believed in when we first joined in? What Bitcoin was like at first. And by that, I mean people that are not heavily invested in company that want to leverage the Bitcoin blockchain to do their bidding, pushing other company and individual off the chain.
I don't think so.
I already said it and I'll say it again. I am made for life. No matter what happen, I'll never die poor because on a dumb day in 2010, a dumb bored me downloaded one dumb software nobody believed in on a dumb mailing list nobody cared about. I'm in it for the long run, so that the generations that will follow me are able to leave of my wealth.
I still believe the best way to reach that goal, RIGHT NOW, is to increase or remove the artificial blocksize and let the market regulate itself.

Redditor for 7 days... such strong opinion for such a young account.
I agree with you on the ads but the other two points you are purposefully lying.
Bitcoin.com pay 110% reward because they keep the fees. They give the reward to the miners plus 1.25 btc from the fees to them, they keep the remaining fees, if any.
All analyses shows that antpool operates unmodified bitcoin core nodes, even the nodes signalling BU are bitcoin core. They are mining per the core implementation rules.

Yes I am putting them together because I am fucking fed up about people assuming stuff about miners, no matter on what side of the fence they are. 
They have way more invested that your usual "hodler" and they spend way more time thinking about bitcoin than any of you/us.
This is the complete opposite of irrational, they are making the decision they firmly believe will protect their investments, and no, they didn't come to the same conclusion.
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:57:01
Nothing.  There is no transaction cancellation . You just hope that all node forget your tx. 
I crafted an unlikely large tx with pretty much new coins and no fee and it never went thru. I forgot about my test but 22 days later, a full node resent my tx and now that the coins were old enough, it did went through. I was quite surprised. 
TX priority is quite complex, as we can see this week . Best I can say is if I didn't go through after a few days is to respond the same coins with a large fee to a online wallet that does not give you the same coins when you withdraw (in case of double spending detection but chances it happen are really slim).

Because they don't believe it is the right way to go, they have way more skin in the game that all the "big time" holders here and they don't want to lose the probably hundreds of millions they have invested.
Segwit is all fine and dandy all by itself but the ugly hack they did and they way they co-opt users to opt-in into segwit is not.
Also, per the agreements SegWit was suposed to be activated with an hard fork increase proposition which has never been developed.
It's all fine to cry about those evil "miners" but most miners, even home gamers, have way more skin in the game than all those hodler that bought in a few months/years ago screaming "SEGWIT" like it is the greatest invention like sliced bread.

Same with bitcoin. It's actual supply is increasing due to mining and one day, just like gold, it will stop being mined because nothing will remain to be mined.
The thing that bitcoin has over gold is that it is divisible down to 8 number after the point and we can go smaller than that if we decide to one day.

You guys realize ASIC design is a highly specialized field and that designing an ASIC cost millions right? I doubt anybody would open source it. 
On the other hand if you can buy chip from bitmain or bitfury and meet minimum order quantity , it's a fairly straightforward matter to design a mining machine from them. A lot of such thing have been done on bitcointalk over the years.
The easiest would be to get the 3 other mining machine manufacturer to actually try to compete with bitmain. 
Bitfury won't sell you anything, they might rent you an overpriced container that you will never see nor control if they like you. BW rather sell you a mining contract and make 10x more on it. Canaan machine were obsolete before they even came out.

It costs ten of millions in design, tooling and setup cost and you have minimum order quantity to meet at foundry to even get an order considered.
I don't agree, you need to be competitive from the get go otherwise the exercise is futile, we already have a company that is uncompetitive against Bitmain and nobody is operating their machine because of it.

@_date: 2012-03-14 00:17:19
Answered myself.
According to [ there is 8 552 800.
So this transaction involved .702% of bitcoin currently in circulation. We are far from total domination over the network, but it's enough to see the market move. That is nice, I really enjoy seeing how the market reacts to such speculations and that it reacts just like any other market do.
I'm sure at least a few botnet own a couple percent of the market. I'm might be widely speculating right now but if all botnet owner come together and do something like that at 10-15% of all bitcoin involved. That is scary as hell.

I think they are mixing by blocksize and production speed (through decreasing difficulty a la litecoin). 
I never heard anybody advocate for a difficulty decrease nor for removing the limit of BTC. 
Removing the upper btc limit would be bitcoin suicide, unless we are in 15 years with a market cap of 400 billion and there is still no fee market for miners. Fee market have to happen one day or another so miners can still make money. 
A 400 billion market capitalisation with a . 25 btc fee market like today is still a huge reward though. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:00:22
If you claim to be satoshi and everything that comes with it (github commit access, millions of unmolested bitcoind, the ability to put 400$ millions in capital back in the market and crashing it) you owe people a concrete proof or you got to sit the fuck down and stfu.
If you would look at the proof yourself and removing all your bias, it is clear that the guy does not have the qualifications and spent 2011 to 2014 being wrong about bitcoin then decided to shut the fuck up, erase his online personality, learn about btc before making an outlandish claim.
