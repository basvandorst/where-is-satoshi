We can agree to disagree-- sure, for an end user there is virtually no difference between them. I'll even agree that, from a developer's perspective, there is virtually no difference in implementing one algo over another. However, the original reasoning for using scrypt over SHA256 (memory inefficiency) was quite compelling and effective at the time. After all, ASICs are just coming out now, and we aren't seeing the same massive performance gains as was the case for BTC. So, since there was some rationale for selecting one algo over another, I personally believe that it is a note-worthy distinction.
If I'm understanding your perspective correctly, you believe any crypto currency that uses PoW is equivalent? Would you consider primecoin equivalent, even though it does not use a hashing algo?
What distinctions do you suggest are worthy of calling something "not a btc clone"? 
I personally believe dogecoin is *not* a clone, due to it's inflationary nature. Would you agree?

Meh, there is a reason to tell someone they have a fundemental misunderstanding of how something works if they are presenting their ridiculous concern as legitamate to thousands of viewers. He's an expert in his field, and experts should speak to what they are knowledgable on. 
I find it very frustrating when people who are *not* experts present information as fact for which they have no clue about, or if nonexperts become frustrated when they are corrected by an expert.

Totally disagree-- I recently received a loan that allows me to rent out rooms in a townhome as an income property. I don't have enough money to pay for the home in cash, but the cash flow makes it appealling enough that I can cover interest costs while making a bit of bank.

Why not simply use Satoshis as the base unit, as is the case in the protocol anyways? 
If you're already proposing to scale everything by 10^-6 , it's not a particularly large leap to instead scale by 10^-8 .
If I have one BTC, I have 100,000,000 satoshis. (Having 100,000,000 of anything currency related sounds fantastic)
One mBTC? 100,000 satoshis.
One uBTC? 100 satoshis
This addresses the psychological issue of people preferring big numbers over decimal places, while maintaining a nomenclature consistent with the core protocol.

He has mentioned that they are "not lost", just temporarily unavailable in an IRC chat. We can only speculate on what that means. 
If he believes he can recover them, he might be frantically trying to do so before admitting such a colossal screw up.
In the event that the gox BTC were seized by US government, he could be under a very, very strict gag order. Allegedly in another IRC chat, before signing off he linked an irrelevant video from the site 9GAG. People have speculated that this is a subtle way of circumventing the gag order.

Mmm, I may be wrong, but my impression is that each transaction is distinct. And so, since both purchases were individually less than $600, you would not need to account for either of these transactions.

Don't keep your btc on an exchange for prolonged periods of time unless you like gambling on someone else being both trustworthy and competent. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:59:09
The current guidance is that transactions of value greater than $600 are taxable.
If you were to trade 5BTC for a car, you would
1. Determine the current fair market value of BTC (by referencing the exchange rate at a particular exchange [you should be consistent in the exchange you use unless there are extenuating circumstances])
2. Determine your cost basis on the coins you are using for the transaction. One of doing this would be to use a FIFO (first in, first out) policy to determine which coins you spent from your wallet, and sum the value of these at the time you received them. (Again, you should be consistent in your methodology for determining this value.)
3. Take the difference between your cost basis and the current fair market value of 5 btc.
4. If it's positive, this means you lost money, and could claim a loss. If it's negative, you will have to claim it as income.
As an example-- suppose I bought two coins at $200, two coins at $700, and received one coin as income when its fair market value was at $1000. I would have a cost basis of $2800 on my five coins. 
Next, suppose the current market rate is $800. The current market value of my five coins would be $4000. 
The difference between these is a $1200 profit. That profit would be taxable income under the guidelines provided today.
To say this is a pain in the ass is an understatement. But hey, at least they allow transactions under $600 to slip by without the hefty paper work. I certainly didn't expect the US gov to let BTC slide without taking their cut, so I'd say this news could be worse. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:04:31


Right, we agree here-- my point was that an average bitcoin user (i.e., non-miner) will use the cost basis at which they bought the coin, not the fair market value at the time it was originally mined (still a pain, but easier than the alternative). My impression of your previous comment was that you disagreed and believed all bitcoin transaction reporting would need to use the value of the coin at the time of mining as the cost basis, which isn't true.


If a person who makes payments totaling a value greater than or equal to $600 is required to report the payment, what about those who made payments totally a value of less that $600? To me, that reads that those spending less than $600 wouldn't need to report it at all. 
And sorry for being a bit rude in my previous comment... it's been a long day, and based on your comment thread I couldn't quite tell if you were genuinely confused or just trolling. Cheers.

My understanding is that they've intentionally ommitted loss of bitcoin in statements they've made regarding loss of customer assets.

@_date: 2014-02-27 18:15:45
Meh, while mostly true, that's not entirely true.
For speculators looking to hoard the coin, effectively 3.5% of all possible BTC just got burned.
That has an impact.
Edit: Think of it in terms of percent market share.
1. I have 50% of all bitcoins and the other 50% is in active use.
2. I have 1% of all bitcoins, 1% is held by the rest of community and is active, and 98% is held by one individual who hasn't moved them in ages.
Under your rational, these two situations are equivalent. In reality, they are very different.

I quoted 12 because it shows that users making transactions at values less than $600 won't have to report it, and thus won't be taxed on it.
Using a cost basis at the time of mining is for miners, not users buying and selling.

paying however your country does capital gains tax, is pretty reasonable IMO.

I agree... it's frustrating as a bitcoin owner that they took this stance. However, the government always wants their cut, and since the only two obvious options for BTC were to either treat it as a stock/gold, wherein exchanges of value incur capital gains, or for them to be uncharacteristically liberal and say that the increase in BTC related businesses (jobs, etc.) are sufficient enough to let transactions slide.
With that in mind, though, if I were to receive my core salary in bitcoin, it is reasonable in the existing tax paradigm that I'd need to pay income taxes in some way, shape, or form. 


a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment of fixed and determinable income using virtual currency
what does 'fixed and determinable income' mean in this case?
and 'in the course of trade or business' makes me think as a business owner
to me it's reading like paying a wage using virtual currency?
not just the payment for a good or service?

... so? I agree that BTC is a stronger coin than LTC, but that doesn't have any impact on the discussion as to whether LTC and other scrypt based coins are strictly BTC "clones".


Again, just because scrypt may or may not be better doesn't impact the discussion of "different". Is prime coin different? Would a coin using a PoW method that was abysmally ineffectual/broken be "different"? In my opinion, yes-- the PoW algorithm selection is a critical component of a crypto currency, and to me it makes a difference what method a coin utilizes.
Edit: Putting it another way-- if SHA256 turned out to be broken in some way (unlikely I know, but bear with me), a coin using another PoW method would quickly gain support if BTC's PoW was not addressed.

Fine, use another block chain altogether if it's just the data structure you want.
The reason they are interested in the bitcoin block chain is because of its size and hashing power.
I don't think it's unreasonable for the core devs to be careful about how the protocol can/cannot be used. In fact, it's their job.
You're being entirely unrealistic if you think that it's a good idea to allow the storage of large, arbitrary chunks of data within each transaction on the block chain without careful consideration.

10% daily interest rate is a bit of an extreme estimate.
More realisitically, but still optimistic-- if you could get 5% interest per year, and your factory can only offer a 4% return, then sure-- BTC would inhibit the development of that new factory. 
However, if the factory can return 6%, then the owner would still invest in that factory (assuming a certain risk profile).
The same argument can be made for any other investment-- if I can make more money doing something else, I'm probably going to put my money into that *something else* rather than into some half-baked investment that can't yield a good return.
