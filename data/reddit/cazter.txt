Hah, I'm not sure. I was aiming for language and description that would register with the typical layman and "Bitcoin's" was the result.

That hashrate isn’t possible with just the GPU’s mentioned.

Sure, I can see how I come off as a boastful shill. And I'll admit that a certain part of me wanted to brag a bit. But my overarching goal was to find some way to convince my friends and family of Bitcoin's potential. Where previous years posts that were more informative and less braggadocio had fallen flat, I made a conscious decision to use tone and wording that would stir some emotions, even negative ones like irritation, in the hope that at least they would engage. The net result has had a little success, but not nearly as much as I hoped for.
If you can think of or you know of an example where similar effort was made, albeit one that was actually successful in its effort to engage- well, I'd love to see it.

Right, but where Bovada is using BitPay as a merchant then how is Coinbase able to distinguish the recipient BitPay address from any other BitPay address?

I have deposited from Coinbase and haven't as yet had an issue. But this did occur to me as I was depositing but where Bovada is using BitPay I couldn't see how Coinbase could reliably determine the recipient was Bovada?

Worked like a charm. Thanks!
