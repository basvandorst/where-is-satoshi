Relax, it will even out. How much are you in? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:02:53
probably, their usd stuff is already set up well for stocks. wouldn't be hard to adapt it to crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:00:50
haha I am 200,000ish in line!
sucka! :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:04:52
ugh, Japanese banks are fucking terrible. Wait til they limit trading hours between 9-5pm Japan time Mon thru Fri. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:30:13
Robinhood will be OK. Their stock platform is great, really. I have no doubt that they will do well with their crypto platform addition.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:20:42
I use them in Japan. Their KYC shit is very annoying if you are not Japanese because of middle names and not matching exactly with bank account info/public ID. Other than that, I have not had any issues. It is similar to coinbase and there is a trading app connected to the main app kInda like gdax.
They also sell Monacoins which I like to have for fun, personally. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:56:34
gotta be patient. It will come to you soon. 
In the mean time, use other exchanges and hodl as much as you can. Don't stress too much about the whole "free trading" shit. Hold what you can and you will gain. Most main cryptos will make gains if you are patient.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:29:37
No Monacoin!? 
残念。失望してる。　:(

Personally, I just split my portfolio between BTC and ETH. I have high hopes for both! But, I don't day trade and probably won't be a millionaire either. I just like watching my numbers move about. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:54:34
so what you are telling me is that there will be no 2nd housing bubble pop soon so I can buy a cheap as fuck house?
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:06:40
I am to the point now where I get around 10 Doge per day (after conversion), which is nothing really. I mostly just stick to it for fun. But I get a 100% loyalty bonus and some referral bonuses. There is also a "mystery bonus" that randomly gives you a boost. Sometimes that can hit it good and double your faucet claim.
I could make more but I only claim like once or twice per day. I have heard of others making around 50 doge per day. You can of course convert that into BTC but Doge is easier to withdraw because you only need 50 to withdraw. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:13:35
yeah, i wouldn't seriously recommend it for most people. Just buy a bunch of doge or BTC with fiat lol. 
But i am on the computer all the time anyway, and it doesn't take me long. There is a kind of relaxing feeling I get when I see my numbers. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:02:04
i switch to the old captchas where you have to type a text. Usually less time consuming. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:17:03
They might cut you a deal. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:21:03
probably because the other 95% are broke. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:11:22
uhhh...what cryptocurrency, officer? I don't know what you are talking about...
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:44:19
We just need to fork BTC into BitcoinLoan. 
We can call it Bloan.
@_date: 2018-05-19 03:50:11
except for the whole anonymous and fungible part. Cash still wins on that front. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:59:44
Probably due to volatility of crypto. ATM owner still has to pay the rent in fiat. 
Could also just be greed. I don't know. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:08:10
Idk, man. Ethereum is pretty solid and it has been around long enough to distinguish itself from BTC. BTC crashes affect it but I have seen it rising while BTC is falling and vice versa. It is not really a direct competitor though either so maybe that is why. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:30:01
Of course not. That is what Monero is for, silly. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 11:48:31
If Monero ever prints physical notes that you can literally throw at a stripper or tuck in her g string while getting a lap dance, maybe. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:03:16
I am already stocking up on XMR. Privacy coins will be a big deal someday. 
BTC for public deals, XMR for backroom deals. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:07:34
that is a fair point, yeah. Along with the niche market comment it makes sense why they charge so much. I am sure the fees will lower significantly when crypto catches on more. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 03:49:37
good luck regulating my Monero. Oh, I mean, what Monero? I lost it all.  
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:29:19
so like, that is unsustainable right? Could one buy a shitload of Bolivars for cheap and have a chance of it changing and becoming worth much more in the future? Surely that kind of inflation must be fixed eventually. Or will Venezuela just use USD or something instead?
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:57:16
Not surprised with the IRS cracking down on crypto in the USA. KYC and SEC regulations are catching up. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:55:14
So basically, BTC is king but ETH is still probably solid. 
k.

story of my crypto life. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 11:58:35
man, I would be evacuating SA asap if I was there. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:46:30
I think the idea is just to get an approximate. Even if the customer underpays a bit, the merchant will gain crypto which may go up later. Or it might go down but oh well. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:59:20
I use Bitflyer because I live in Japan. Fees are annoying but not too bad. I could probably do better elsewhere but Bitflyer has been good to me overall. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 03:44:53
In grorious Japan, we just send our stay at home wives to the bank for us. No joint accounts either because our wives own us anyway. Also why ATMs follow regular banking hours. 
You no need a no fee, 24/7 ATM. You need to pay outside the hours of 8:30 to 17:00.  
Blegh. Fuck it. All hail crypto! 
@_date: 2018-10-28 21:49:32
877 CASH NOW!
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:14:30
debit cards are probably fine. I don't think merchants pay fees on debit txs like they do credit. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:05:33
I heard that there were two gold tablets. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:51:44
well it wasn't always shit rates. Savings accounts back in the 80s were up around 5 or 6% apy. Money Markets were up in the teens. 
Nowadays, yeah. Banking your money sucks unless your bank has your private wealth managers.  Really nice credit cards though at certain banks if you qualify. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:13:31
Sorry, officer. I lost all my Bitcoins in a tragic boating accident last year...
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:12:53
why don't banks buy money like everyone else? 
they loan out your money (because they don't have everything on hand right now), make a shitload and give you your initial deposit + a small percentage back as payment. That is how banking works. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:44:48
what Monero users?
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:48:53
Interesting. Is it still the 2% like on a visa card? Surely it is less unless Visa (or MC or whoever) authorizes the debit card too. Now that I think about it though, my American debit card has a Visa logo on it.

What is her income? She should be able to qualify for the "foreign tax credit" or for the "foreign earned income exclusion" for any amount less than I think like 110k dollars a year. She has to file taxes as a US citizen every year but unless she has a shitload of assets back home in the states, there are ways to get out of paying.
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:53:17
More money will come. This is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:36:03
man, what a long strange trip this has been. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:10:23
I don't get it. Libra is gonna be a stablecoin right? What makes it so different from using another stable coin like dao? The companies behind Libra in the whitepaper make me trust it even less lol! 
I guess normies just won't understand and will eat this shit up.
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:46:20
yeah but $1000 won't get you shit in dividends. You need more capital to make it more meaningful within one's lifetime. $1000 of BTC could change someone's life if a big moonshot hits. 
It is a gamble. But gambling with smaller amounts is easier, imo.
@_date: 2019-04-29 08:05:47
seems really clunky, imo. I get that this is Venezuela and the inflation problem makes using crypto worth it but there are too many steps in what I just watched for this to be useful worldwide. Dropping some USD bills on the counter would be easier and faster. 
Still, we are slowly getting there.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:18:52
That is true. A lot of people from my generation love to LOOK like they have their shit together but are riding on CC debt. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:23:29
True. if bitcoin actually levels out and loses some of its volatility, maybe it can actually start being adopted as a currency instead of a lamborghini machine. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:13:18
Not surprising at all really. Most millenials don't have good jobs. The ones that do are probably still paying down debt instead of saving/investing. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:27:58
what are you gonna keep in the vault? Do you have the codes for it?
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:29:00
I mean, yeah true but in the US at least there is FDIC insurance on all bank deposit accounts. 
Investment accounts, not so much. But hey, that is a risk you gotta take to invest.

Wow, such stable. Much strong doge. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:03:25
food, water, radiation protection and guns and ammunition is probably a better investment in that case. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:05:36
It was Coinbase's plan all along!
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:04:04
where do you keep your money?
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:22:56
I do both, personally. I love ETFs and stocks of companies I really believe in. That said, the volatility of cryptos is also alluring to me now but I never go all in. I also am looking forward to using BTC as an actual working currency in the future. It has a lot of potential. 
Guess I am boring lol.  
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:10:51
It is fine. If you are interested in trading, gdax is a fine platform. Don't buy and sell on the coinbase platform tho because you pay high fees. Buy and sell through gdax. You can transfer dollars from your bank. Credit cards are a bad idea usually for cryptos until things change. Also remember that transfers are free from your coinbase wallet to gdax. 
If you really wanna get into cryptos and hold some long term (not trading) get a ledger nano s or other hardware wallet and keep your coins off exchanges (unless you are trading them, and even then, only keep a fraction on the exchange).  
If you get comfortable and want to get involved in other crypto coins, check out Binance. Just remember never to invest more than you can lose. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:42:20
Don't worry, brother. Head on down to the ol' HUB and you will find your Japanese girl waiting for you. 
She may be dumb as a box of rocks but that is OK. She can cheer for you as you deposit more yennies into Bitflyer ;)
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:46:37
Some altcoins are great! If I was in the market, I would buy questionable things with Monero ;)

@_date: 2018-02-08 22:52:12
true, I meant any crypto to be honest. Doesn't have to be BTC itself. Especially if BTC becomes like the gold-equivalent for cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:35:44
I hope it is dogecoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:46:52
I don't see how coffee business currently would do that though. Credit card and cash is much faster than waiting for a bitcoin tx to go thru.

I personally like Bitcoin and Monero. They are different enough from each other to each have different purposes. I also like Dogecoin because it is the most stable coin. 1Ð=1Ð
@_date: 2018-07-07 03:31:46

@_date: 2018-04-30 13:20:24
I am no expert in the way of the DOGE. but I can say that is used to be the defacto transfer coin. Litecoin worked well too but doge was the fastest. The lightning network kinda competes with it now but dogecoin is still probably one of the fastest transferring coins out there. Doge is just not as accepted because it isn't as well known. Setting up a doge wallet is easy enough though. Coinomi is probably the fastest hot wallet you can start that takes doge. You can transfer the doge off coinomi to a cold storage for almost no fee (like 1-3 doge or something last I checked though that could have changed since then). 
It is also cute, which is more than most other coins can say. Monacoin is also pretty cute but is mostly Japan-only. So doge it is. Such cute. So wow!    
@_date: 2018-04-26 04:20:31
Chase did this a few years ago. Business accounts were excluded. People got REALLY pissy when I asked for ID when I was a teller. 
And I feel like blocking cash deposits from non account signers for small amounts is unnecessary. I could understand if it was like more than $1000 or something. But no, totally banned. We had to tell people to use personal or cashier's checks, transfer from their checking or do a debit transaction. No cash. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:40:39
wow, such insult. much sad. please sorry. wow...

there, I said the word for you. I will take the downvotes. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:04:51
Bitcoin is a currency, not a stock. It is like buying Yuan with your Dollars and hoping the exchange rate goes up someday.
