Blockchain all the things! He must be new here. I give it 6 months. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 03:52:54
People can pretend to be humble. There is nothing humble about VitalikCoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:30:13
I wonder how much he lost. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 00:58:57
Are we really still doing this? 
@_date: 2016-04-21 20:24:05
Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:38:58
Nope, that's an orange. We're talking apples here. 
@_date: 2016-04-18 01:31:29
Like OB, with demand? I'd tap that. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 05:33:39
So retro! Maybe he'll send you a VHS. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 05:34:30
No. Because it's not anonymous. 
@_date: 2016-04-18 00:21:44
Is this like OB but without the shipping?
@_date: 2016-04-18 00:25:16
BitTorrent solved a hard problem though, and there was/is actual demand for its "product". 
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:10:48
But they know where he lives. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 02:31:00
Yes. No. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:00:41
No, nobody can.

Adding more data to a hard disk doesn't slow anything down.

Coinbase let's you hold your own private keys now too. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:01:15
Found it in the FAQ:  
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:17:38
Well said.
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:18:13
If you're not using the same password, and they're nothing alike, then it's way more likely that your computer was compromised. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:16:14
That's a generic paragraph. This is not the only test on the site.
@_date: 2014-02-17 23:25:35
Taking off in the South East too, to say nothing of the North and South WEST. Once they expand their viewpoint, they'll see it all! Not their style.. I know. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:22:47
This will grab headlines, and that's all people read. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:35:02
yes but you said "simple solution"
@_date: 2014-03-19 05:04:36
This level of transparency impresses the shit out of me. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:11:08
didn't know why my phone was beeping. realized it was happening for every donation.
left it on!
Smiling every time it beeps. =) =) =)

Game over? I could see some security holes leading to a 'game over' scenario but this is not one of them. All exploits are certainly not equal. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 02:53:24
If you deal in dollars, it's the law to do KYC/AML.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:59:57
Also Dorian is 64 years old. 64!!

You can't buy BTC on Coinbase directly with a credit card so no worries there. It's only used as a backup in case of insufficient funds in your bank account, and to allow for instant purchases. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:07:16
Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:30:17
Why the fuck are you so upset over this?
@_date: 2016-01-09 15:38:55
Wait, how does putting text on the blockchain stop people faking their diplomas?
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:18:12
You're replying to one of the show's hosts :(
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:41:26
Smart contract concerns. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:42:17
Why does the blockchain confirm Plutons instantly? Is this your own private database? Errr.. "blockchain"?
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:10:02
How was that a stunt?
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:03:30
What paid services would an OB user require?
@_date: 2016-12-11 16:58:37
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:28:37
It's cloud mining, so it probably doesn't matter because it's [probably a scam.]( 
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:10:50
Strange. No mention of Chris OR even Junseth?

Coinbase's regular vaults may not be the safest, but they also now have vaults where you control the keys: 
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:15:28
TIL the market is high. Sell!
@_date: 2016-09-23 12:38:31
Free publicity. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 15:17:29
I think Andreas can claim a little more than that when it comes to Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-04-28 15:32:30
That, and because investors can be just as "dumb" as Canadian senators. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:43:20
Well said. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 17:34:41
Hey buddy. Somethin on your mind?
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:39:31
The (consensus) part that would make Ethereum a huge deal has yet to be solved though. The hype is huge, but that's about it. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 15:12:09
What's the opposite of shocked?
@_date: 2016-10-07 03:56:28
So. Retarded. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:27:54
How does such a solid explanation mix up the words 'borrow' and 'loan'?!
@_date: 2016-05-15 17:29:13
How is this a headline? Shyah, one is real, the other is a database. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:20:52
But if you must, use a vault. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:47:14
You can hear him speak twice a week at
