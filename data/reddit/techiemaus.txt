...thanks for that. But I would like to mine bitcoins for myself, not for charity. Is there another solution ?

My mom is 80, using a smartphone and owns 5 bitcoin, "just in case", she said.
Update: When I explained it to her, I made the comparison to the evolution of the Internet, that did the job in an easy.

Maybe, holders sitting there with their bitcoin and watching a price range between $200-$300, for weeks and monhts till they get bored and start buying things with bitcoin to get rid of them. This is where the next bubble could start.

Gold is one of the most manipulated things in the financial world. There is 100 times more Gold on paper then we have physically. The Gold price is far from reality !!!

I know a guy who is big in bitcoin. This pic should be his birthday gift (to draw his attention).

I just switched  off my two Antminer S2. I pay $0.15 for power and outside temp is zero degree celsius. It makes no sense at all with this price/difficulty and that equipment.

I like bitcoin and I hope it does not hurt someone to see my tits ;-)
And I know you guys know how to make crazy stuff with photoshop. This is why I'm was asking. If I put this in another sub, I may get all sort of things, but not bitcoin related. And for your effort, you can see my tits, I don't mind :-)

...oh boy, open up your mind. There are so many things with a bitcoin sticker on.

That is not a problem of Bitcoin or Cryptsy alone. I use Ameritrade since years, never had any troubles putting money in my stock trading account. BUT NOW !!! I tryed to cash out just $7000.-. Oooh, big questions, when and WHY I would cash out. Just paranoid !
