This is Philip from All4Btc and I'd like to apologize for your frustrating experience with us. We have worked on our customer service and have been keeping up with our customers like never before. The last price boom led to an explosion of orders we did not have the infrastructure at the time to handle (we had to close down the the site for two weeks to catch up on orders). 
We now have a brand-new backend thanks to a great new developer who has helped us out so that our customer service team can easily handle all of our orders, even if the price goes to the moon!
We have contacted all our customers to make sure issues were resolved, and we can move on to handling orders as usual (as we have been for two months now).
Again, sorry for your bad experience with us. We have many satisfied customers that we love to make happy with the amazing technology of Bitcoin, and are trying to satisfy every customer so that they can tell others about how you can use Bitcoin to buy anything anywhere.

[Here's the story]( behind the post... Any others with frustrated partners?

Correct, but the agency involved with making this decision still has the ultimate responsibility to look into how bitpay works ... especially if they are getting conflicting information.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:37:40
I agree, and also wrote about this feeling just a few days ago, with some evidence....

Since we do not have user registration, no username/password/email combinations exist anywhere in our system. This is what was meant by "built with security and privacy in mind". We routinely emphasize the lack of registration at all4btc.com
I understand certain phrasing does sound like pure PR, and it's good to keep this critical mindset while talking about security, but we wanted to assure our customers -- many of which are not aware of the details -- that their information is safe.

Let us know about your wishlist or invididual order progress, we improved our support system with tickets, email confirmations and status quo updates.
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:17:52
We're sorry that you had this experience with us. We have completely reworked our website to focus on customer service and communication with our customers. Many people order through us without a problem, especially after our upgrades. If you or anybody still has an issue they can contact us at support or call us. We have learned a lot from our customers and hope you can try us again, many returning customers who don't often post on reddit or forums have never had problems with us.
We always make sure our customers get what they want, or at the very least a timely refund.

[All4btc.com]( works well with Amazon.de. And as of today we cut our fees to 2% for Euro sales!
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:50:24
What's your address again? :)
...But seriously, we went through all of our customers' orders to make sure we don't have any open issues like this. In the rare case a customer requests a refund, we do it in a timely manner. We've improved the site so that we are only taking orders we can handle quickly. If you have a question before an order, please email us at support

Hello, this is Philip from All4Btc, and I just wanted to show off our Chrome Extension for our site, which places a handy little "Buy with Bitcoin" button directly on Amazon.com and Ebay.com.
It may take some training (and autofill) to get your time down to 10 seconds, but the idea is that it's much quicker than signing up for an account, clicking an email validation link, and risking entering your credit card information.
EDIT: link to [all4btc.com]( to save finger strength.
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:52:07
Thanks! 
The new 2% fee for Euro is in the post. If you have any other questions, [contact us]( We also have a lot of other answers on our [FAQ Page](

Thanks again for your advise, we adopted the content to meet the terms. We do not want to defraud or burn anybody and we like to encourage anonymous gifting. Here is a cross-reference for our motivation -  Sometimes it is just easier and more valuable to ask on Reddit for honest feedback than anywhere else.
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:27:33
Why? What can we improve?
