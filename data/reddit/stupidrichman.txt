But corrections like that happened several times in this year, even more worse than this one.
Some weak hands will sell, others will stay and over the time, they just get bored by these corrections.
I am sure that there are also a lot of people out there that made losses in btc. They are selling low, see the prices going upwards again, getting frustraded and maybe buying again afterwards. Some will learn how btc dumps and pumps and dont make the mistake again. Some will leave completely. And some others still doing this mistake everytime again.

I sold my BCH instantly after fork and I am definitely no supporter, but: I would hold at least a small amount if I was you. 
I think before Lightning Network is released, BCH has a good chance to grow. A few weeks before the Lightning Network is implemented I would sell the BCHs instantly because I wouldn't see any reason why this coin should be pumped anymore. Think it will be dumped very hard then.
Of course this is just my opinion. I am not a professional Investor and can be totally wrong.

Please make your homework: read about Lightning and how it can solve the problems you mentioned.
Of course the integration is not 100% save, but the chances are very good. 
What you are doing ist shitposting without any knowledge about future integration plans.
