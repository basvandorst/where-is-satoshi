Crash is over. It is going up from here. Finally :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:24
Post it here. I would like to see it!

It is much more likely to be a boom. More money will be invested. The banks need customers who buy the futures. If it works out companies like Wal Mart, Toyota, Volkswagen etc. will start accepting btc. That ia how we reach 100k in 2018.

LTC or ETH.

It is way to volatile for any investment fund to go in. We only see personal and small government  (central banks) investment.

How old are you?

It will do this until the bubble bursts. The thing os you never know when it will burst.

Why is there a need for mining? What happens when all btc have been mined? Then only transactions will consume electricity, right?

A lot of big investors (banks and governments) are pouring in their money. The risk now is too high not to be invested. They did their math.

No LTC? Why? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:09:12
If so where would they buy? Look at the transaction volume on gdax. Do you see any big players there yet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:44
They are online again

The risk that BTC becomes the world's most important courency.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:30:44
40k in summer!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:53:43
Because the money they are pouring in is peanuts for them. Central.banks have huge amounts of money they use as tools to stabilize courencies. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:44:53
How do you transfer to gdax and how long does it take?
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:40:10
But what if people trade their B2X into BTC. That should drive demand...or not?

I transfered my money to bch when we were under 6000. Bch was worth over 2k. Unfortunately it plummeted quickly. It cost me a whole day figuring out how to send them to exchange to have them transfered back. I had 0.1btc before. Now i only have 0.65 :( next time I go to a casino. At least there you know the odds ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:36:29
Just transferedy btc to bch. The transaction is pending and btc is on the rise again and bch is goi g down. Man! It seams like I should do the exact opposite. Can I cancel a pending transaction on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:16:26
Will the price go up or down right after the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:47:49
But when do you think it will peak before it hits rock bottom (close to worthless)? Hypothetically...
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:01:05
I am having the same problem. It is like they don't want you to login and sell. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:10:47
How can this happen?
