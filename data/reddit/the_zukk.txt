Hey thanks for looking into that. Your link was a great read. 
I don't really follow your logic though. The link you provided has de-regulation as a much large contributor than over regulation. In fact the FCIC report on your link has the majority report (democrat) and the minority's dissenting report (republican) both saying it wasn't the fault of government regulation. It was only commissioner Peter wallison who wrote his own dissenting report who said it was over regulation.
The rest of the wiki goes into all the regulatory oversight laws which had been removed over the last twenty years. And even concluded that the Community Reinvestment Act was not a contributor because only 6% of sub prime loans had any connection to the CRA.

99 percent of the population doesn't give a shit about the topics you want talked about. This guy is selling the technology to the masses and giving them use cases that they can understand and care about. The added benefit to society (whether they know it or not)  is the fact that this new network allows more disobedience to authority and censorship resistance. But that's not how you sell it because you come off as a paranoid nut. 
Once the technology is embedded in society, then people will realize how valuable censorship resistance really is. Or maybe they will take it for granted but either way it will be there. But first you have to get this technology developed and sold to the masses and the guy in this TED talk did a great job doing that. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 02:34:50
Bitcoin won't survive if it doesn't stop growing. It won't keep growing unless it still attracts new people. To attract new people you have to appeal to people who don't care about censorship resistance. You have to think longer term and not short sighted.

There has been an evolution of money over the centuries. People in power can look at history and see what happens when they try to go to war with a finite amount of money. It bankrupted empires and gouged the people. Revolutions are built on squandering a countries wealth. By making money completely arbitrary they get to do all the things they want without the short term consequences. Who cares about the long term especially when idiots out there are telling them it’ll be aight. They can now spend trillions at war and lower taxes in the same breath. Win win right? No consequences there.


Maybe but the scales are not comparable. If you increase gdp by 3% sure you can get a little more in taxes. In Fiat you can shrink gdp and print 20% more money like it’s magic. You don’t see a problem here?


This is retarded. It’s not even on the same scale. See previous point.


Never said there was magic. Only accountability. It doesn’t matter what commodity it’s tied to. Although gold is the most obvious but I think in the world of Cryptos we can now have our cake and eat it too. We have programmable money and can eliminate the greed of people and program in rules. You can have deflation as your base and inflation on higher layers. You can program routines that create money when certain conditions are met or maintain a certain level of inflation or deflation automatically in real time. The possibilities are endless. It was never a good idea to give so much power (money creation) in the hands of so few. Soon we don’t have to. 


The problem in the past was it being difficult to trade as the value of money increased. In a digital world there is no scarcity of money. It is infinitely divisible.


In every other instance do you think central planning is better than market driven distribution? People just don’t have enough information in real time to make these decisions even if they are working 100% altruistically.

Nope you just decided not to do any research since you obviously weren’t around during the early 90s.
In 1994 the percent of households in America with internet access was 11.65%. That’s not a percent of wealthy people, that’s the percent of total households in America. That’s more penetration than the current bitcoin holders in America. Definitely not the late 90s.
AOL didn’t really take off till 1996 when it removed its pay by the hour structure to a flat monthly fee. Netscape wasn’t released till 1995, geocities launches in 1995. So 1994 was still very difficult to use. Very similar to bitcoin today.

Incentivizing debt is a great way to cripple your economy over time. We’re seeing it now with millennials.

It’s very hard to justify war, defense spending, welfare, just about everything the government spends on when you have to go to the people who voted you in office and tell them you need to raise their taxes up to 75% of their income to afford it all. It’s easier to convince them the gold standard sucks and then print all the money you need and spend into deficits. Gold standard keeps the printing press honest.

I don’t have a crystal ball. It could go two ways. An escape of the current system and a safe haven against the inflationary fiat or the crash could bring down everything bitcoin included.

Fiat gives those people in power more power. The only way to get something that is good for the people is from the people which is why non democracies are also not looking at it. The problem is there is no appetite from the people yet. That will change I hope (I’m an optimist).

Yes this would happen. But it puts the advantage on the worker instead of the company. How often does inflation occur yet the company doesn’t raise wages? Wages always trail inflation because of this. If a company doesn’t decrease wages in a deflationary system then congrats you just got a raise.

Cheaper for the user yes, not for the merchant. Quicker? Yes kind of. When you make a cc purchase it actually takes three days. That’s why it says pending in your account. Bitcoin settles in ten minutes depending on the fee paid. Both are sent instantaneously.
Safer? No. The current system is just a bad system. You basically give your account number and a ton of personal info to every merchant. That is why fraud is so rampant. It’s also bad being in a pull system, where once a merchant has your account info they can just keep charging. Lots of mistakes happen because of this. Bitcoin switches that system to a push system. You push funds to an address like email. You don’t give any personal info, just an address. And giving that address out doesn’t jeopardize funds. Now bitcoin has along way to go for a better user experience and the fees are too high currently. But those things come as the infrastructure is built out. It took decades for the internet to be the way it is today. It will take decades for bitcoin as well.

Come on now Becky...
I don’t think anyone has denied the price got out in front of the technology. That is called a bubble. But being a bubble does not mean it’s going to zero (which is what most people who don’t know what they are talking about say when they scream bubble!). Just returning to it’s actual value before the mania began.
Why does someone need to explain to you the value? Are you incapable of google and YouTube videos? I’ll start though. Bitcoin is the first global, decentralized, trustless, scarce digital token. It solved something called the Byzantine generals problem. It has huge implications in a world moving more and more digital. If you don’t want to call people names like your original comment I would be glad to answer your questions about bitcoin.
OP wasn’t snarky or obnoxious. He was just pointing out that a dip doesn’t mean he’s lost any money. I haven’t lost any money. And even if I did, you only really lose if you sell. I still have the same number of bitcoin as yesterday. And when it gets below a certain level I will be buying like crazy. I’ve been waiting for this pull back for months!

That’s assuming 1. 10% deflation, 10% inflation is equally as destructive. 2. That people wouldn’t still seek out higher returns. Sure having some money in “cash” is smart even now when that money loses value but even smarter when it doesn’t lose value, but people will always seek out higher returns. If your emergency fund gains 2% of purchasing power a year great but your still going to invest in stocks to get 10% per year and your still going to put most of it in a bank to get 5% per year in interest. Banks will still loan to small business, they will just require higher interest rates.

Let me tell you a story,
I make gullible coin, decide to premine 1 trillion coins and hold them myself. I then trade 1 coin to my buddy for $1. Wow look at that, I have a market cap of 1 trillion dollars! Bitcoin is doomed!
Edit: ps. Market cap for bitcoin is equally as flawed at least the way most people use it. I’ve seen people take all the coins that have been created thus far or even all the coins that will ever be created (21 million) and multiply it by the current price. This is misleading. It’s people trying to project bitcoin to be larger than it is. You should try to estimate the bitcoin that is valid (not destroyed or lost) and then multiply the price to determine a more accurate measure. I’ve heard good effort estimates of 1-2 million coins lost or destroyed. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:09:06
Well you just aren’t correct. You seem to be comparing Apple and oranges in some cases and just not understanding how the current system works in other cases. Let’s go through it.


This is not the reason. Each transaction must go through a clearing house which is why it takes a few days to post to your account. It is a technological limit.


Sorry but also no. The merchant gets all the information stored on the card. They can do a lot with it like charge you over and over without your permission. And as you stated lower down if you are purchasing online even more information is provided. All this information is stored in centralized databases which are then hacked on a daily basis. This information can be used by hackers to charge anything they want to the card. Or do more nefarious things with it.


Fraud is a billion dollar industry and affected the most people ever (all time high) in 2016. I would call that rampant but I suppose you can define it however you like.  You only get your money back in the cases of using a credit card. Usually if money is stolen from your account you are shit out of luck. And by the way you could develop credit tokens that ride on bitcoin if there is demand for credit cards.


Firstly, obviously you can be scammed with any currency. Scams will always be there and is not a great argument for fiat. Secondly yes bitcoin acts more like cash. So the dollar is just as easily scammed and there is no recourse to get that back. Credit cards and other financial devices can be built on top of bitcoin which gives consumer protections which will happen if there is demand for it. Also it’s just as easy to lose cash as it is bitcoin, wallet gets lost, forget where you put it. Etc etc.

We’re seeing this now with millennials. Trillions of dollars are locked up in credit card and student loans that cannot go to the economy. When boomers die off who is going to keep the housing market up? Millennials who already have a mortgage payment called student loans that don’t even go away in bankruptcy? And when those markets do crash how does one retire when all their money was in the stock market?

Obviously big business and the government went for intranets first before conceding that the internet was where the real value comes from. It will take time for the same thing to happen to bitcoin. It’ll be a slow methodical gradual adoption until one day nocoiners will look at each other and ask what happened.

It’s not acting as a currency yet. It needs to have value first. Just look at how much money is in it. Are you so arrogant that you think you understand bitcoin more than the people who actually researched how it works and then put their own money into it adding to over 200 billion? 
200 billion. People have valued bitcoin to be that amount. Value of anonymity. Value of cross border transactions without seizure. Value of inflation resistance. Value of speculation on future development.
As it becomes more valuable, more people become comfortable trading it for goods and services. We won’t see that for a while still. Until then it will just be a hedge against crazy politicians.

The reason no one wants to entertain your post is because it’s tiring for someone who’s been around for years and had this conversation many times. And then altcoiners just don’t get it and lose money anyway.
Bitcoin is not a currency. The currency/store of value/token is secondary. Bitcoin is a protocol. When you start understanding bitcoin as a protocol then you realize why there won’t be more than one. Same reason we don’t have competing internets out there. There were multiple internets in the beginning but network effects and standardization consolidated them down to one. Same will happen here. There will be a consolidation of technologies as bitcoin builds new functionalities on higher layers. As bitcoin is able to do the thing alt coins can (privacy, micro transactions, real estate, whatever) on higher layers, the less secure altcoin is now obsolete and dies. Bitcoin grows. 
There will be tokenizing of lots of things, especially companies, but they will probably be side chains to bitcoin or higher layers.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:48:17


You completely ignored my comment. I said cryptos btw not bitcoin. I also said you could have a base that’s bitcoin (hard supply deflationary) and build all Kind of currencies on top. You could build infinite number of different currencies on top in second layers or atomic swaps and have them all compete freely in the market. You could program different rules for each. One with 1% inflation, another with 2% inflation, one with deflation, etc etc. they settle on bitcoin and if you want you can use bitcoin as savings and higher layer inflationary coins as checking. The possibilities are endless and many many experiments will be conducted in real time. Stop and think of what tools we have now to really see what would happen with different economic models. Whereas before it was all theory and no matter what arguments people put up everyone remain entrenched in whatever world view they think makes sense (look at you and me). And anyone can opt in or out. Don’t pigeon hole yourself with just bitcoin.


Run on banks are impossible with the open blockchain. The problem was people trusted banks to hold their funds and then got scared that their money wasn’t there. Bitcoin is audited in real time.


I disagree and we will both see this play out. Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. It will be expanded and built on top of. You can sit on the side lines but this new technology will bring money itself into real market competition which has never been seen before. Fiat won’t be able to change or compete in the long run. Whether deflationary or inflationary wins out I have no idea. But I do know we are moving toward a digital world and cryptos will be a part of that.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:50:35

@_date: 2019-07-12 19:47:31
Governments will be involved in the smart contract creation. For example coders and regulators work together once to create the smart contract. It can contain rules and laws that literally cannot be broken because the bitcoin itself won’t move unless all the parameters are met. So regulators will be involved on the smart contract creation side, but no need to have regulators on the enforcement side. 
Bitcoin is deflationary like gold is deflationary. In the since that, yes, it’s purchasing power increases over time as long as demand continues the rise. If bitcoin (or gold) we’re used as the global currency then demand would increase due to population growth. (Supply is effectively fixed in relation to demand, in realty supply increases a little bit but demand outpaces supply so it increases in purchasing power).
Fiat is inflationary in the sense that it always loses purchasing power (or at least governments shoot for a target inflation).
In economics terms, anything that has an increasing supply is considered inflationary. So bitcoin is inflationary in that sense, but it is the least inflationary money that’s ever existed and will eventual cease to be inflationary when the last bitcoin is mined.
Bitcoin is inflation proof because (in the macro sense) it has a constant supply and will increase in purchasing power as long as it’s increasing or maintaining demand. 
Fiat will always print money to increase supply so it outpaces demand. This devalues every dollar you own every day and why economists suggest you put your savings in riskier higher yielding securities.

You think the best method of transacting is literally giving every merchant your entire bank info? Credit card fraud was 25 billion in 2016.


Are you capable of using empathy or even an imagination to project that perhaps not everyone in the world lives in a free country? Would bitcoin be useful to them? If so, would the price of bitcoin increase due to demand increase? Would you want to ride the wave of bitcoin adoption to make money? If no that’s fine but you may find as more and more companies jump on board that your forced into using it in 30 years.


That’s great. You probably should a little. But even if you don’t, again do you see demand in countries like Venezuela? Zimbabwe? Argentina? Iran? Turkey? Countries that have hyperinflation now?


Hey man that’s great. Me too. I keep an emergency fund at credit union to avoid fees. And I invest in stocks like you. And I have seen how, even though I’m privileged to have a mostly free country, that there is demand for the unbanked and politically oppressed. 
I only have 1% of my portfolio in crypto. That 1% has by far been my best investment but I put that 1% in there because I can see the demand even if I don’t need it for that reason and I like to diversify.
In addition I have value in something that if the government or the banks nuke the current banking system again like in 2008, I have a completely independent source of value. Same reason I hold gold too.
As bitcoin develops and creates more and more functions and automations is when you will see real demand in 1st world countries..

He is worried that we’re on the brink of a recession. He knows if a recession hits before Election Day he is fucked. So he wants to lower interest rates and increase printing to kick the can down the road far enough. Bitcoin is a part of that, he can’t let people dump the dollar for bitcoin.

I understand economics just fine. Let’s take a look at the governments claims (and yours by proxy)


So it’s healthy to lose value? And the only way to protect your value is to invest in securities which are inherently riskier (no such thing as risk free). It’s a system that steals from the people and forces spending. Spending that has caused the average American to have negative net worth. And wouldn’t be able to cover an emergency without more debt. Economists say it’s good for society but ask anyone on the street if they would allow the government to come to their house and take 2% per year they would laugh at you. Economists want spending, but adding debt on the people over and over is unsustainable. 


Ok, so is the person your describing here getting richer or poorer every day? 


It’s ego. They think they can control the market and then are shocked when a recession happens. Printing money allows them to build more without taxing the people more. So instead they devalue everyone’s money and use the money they made out of thin air to spend on political promises. Like walls, military, healthcare, welfare. None of these things are possible without printing money unless you tax the people. But it is a secret tax that no one notices until it happens faster and faster.


Very cynical of you. I just don’t want my money to be devalued. I was poor and I worked hard for it. Inflation is one of the worst things for society. And for some reason people think the US is so smart that it won’t get out of control for them. But turkey, Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Germany, Iran, they are all smart too and they have experienced what happens when money is printed too much. 
Also I don’t want governments to forcibly take my money like what happened in Greece. 
Ill leave this here:


Trump wants to cut interest rates and continue money printing even though we’re in a bull market. This is a first. Most presidents only lower interest rates and begin printing in horrible recessionary periods. Now they want to do it always.

The power consumption gives it real world value. It proves to everyone using it that in order for your transaction to be in a block, X amount of real world energy had to be expended. And it would take the same amount or more to change or alter that record. It’s literally the reason it exists and why no other crypto will work. That and it’s immaculate conception. The energy usage is the reason bitcoin is so secure without the need for a government with a gun. It’s consensus without a middleman.
Energy use becomes less of a problem if it’s abundant, cheap, and clean. The world is moving that way and then the amount of energy bitcoin uses (or anyone else uses for any purpose) becomes irrelevant.

With hardware wallets you generate a seed (usually 12 or 24 words). With these words you can generate your private keys with many different types of wallets. So if your hardware wallet gets stolen or the company goes out of business and you don’t want to keep money on hardware that isn’t receiving updates then you can take your seed words and move your bitcoin elsewhere.

Yes most everything will be on a blockchain. Just as most everything happens online these days. The public at large could not believe how much the internet would change everything. But people who understood it saw and predicted its prevalence in society. They couldn’t predict what company would do what but they could predict things like the internet of things.

Yes. 
Set a goal and stick to it. Such as,  “I won’t sell for 5 years”. And then buy the dips.
My goal was, when I could sell X btc and recoup my entire initial investment, I would, that way my remaining coins would be risk free to me. It was all profit at that point.
My next one is when I can sell X btc and pay off my house. I’ll wait and see if it happens. I already hit my first goal so even if it goes to zero tomorrow it’s no skin off my back.
Setting goals helps you to not panic sell during a 20% drop. I’ve held mine past two 90% drops over year long time periods and have done very well because I would think of the drops like a sale and scoop them up as the price drops. If it dropped 1% I buy a little. 20% I buy more, 80% I buy a lot.

Just because you haven’t spent the time to understand how bitcoin works or why it has value doesn’t mean that it doesn’t.


Really? Why do you think that?
Do you find value in cheaper transactions? Bitcoin when developed has the potential to eliminate middle man drastically reducing the cost to transact.
Do you find value in financial freedom? Do you think China should be able to tell its people what companies they are allowed to transact with? They have the social score now, which if your score is low, keeps certain people from purchasing certain things or flying or leaving the country.
Do you find value in protection from inflation? Venezuela, turkey, Argentina, Iran. These countries have printed too much and created hyper inflation. Do you see value in a currency that isn’t controlled by the government that can allow you to avoid the elimination of your wealth?
Have banks killed you with fees or other predictory practices? You can’t pull your fiat out because then it starts losing value quick. At least your getting a small interest payment in the bank. You can put it in securities but now you have lost liquidity. 
There are many many many uses. Many of which haven’t been invented yet.

The value is exactly what people are willing to pay, as with anything.
Yes beanie babies were valued at 5000 because people were speculating that people would value it higher in the future. Beanie babies have no utility beyond comfort so the percentage of its value driven by speculation was like 99%.
I agree part of bitcoins value is due to speculation. There is a difference though. Bitcoin has utility beyond speculation. It has utility as cross border payments, censorship resistance, inflation resistance, value transfer for the unbanked, anonymous transactions, etc.
What is the percentage of speculation vs the value coming from these other factors? Who knows. But I can tell you in the US it’s mostly speculation but in Venezuela it’s used most as a store of value. And btw the price for bitcoin is higher in Venezuela than the US. 
So it comes down to, will the utility satisfy what the speculators think it will? Can the value due to utility catch up to the value the speculators have bet it will be?
Next you can compare bubbles like beanie babies to bitcoin. And the big thing that sticks out is, when an asset is driven by the vast majority being speculation (like beanie babies) then when the bubble does burst, it doesn’t recover. But when an asset does have utility, when it corrects and then recovers (like bitcoin has done 5 times now) then it follows much more closely to an S curve of adoption then it does a complete speculative bubble.
What we see in bitcoin is when it’s value gets taken over by speculation, the price gets way ahead of the value due to utility, and then it corrects (usually between 80-90%) which drops the price below utility. Then it levels off somewhere in the middle before speculation again drives it higher and the cycle repeats.
That is until you have market saturation. As you approach saturation, the volatility and the cycle reduces in size but continues in perpetuity called price discovery.

It’s been a generation since ww2 and people have forgotten the state of affairs previous to that. Look at the interval of wars (between major powers) prior to ww2.

Basically every 15-30 years there would be a major conflict between global powers which just decimated populations.

Well... shall we use the last decade as a data point? How’d it do in the last decade? There’s only been 60 days in which if you had bought, you would be negative today. That’s some serious growth and store of value. It’s the best investment of any kind of the past decade. 
How have your investments done? You probably just think I’m lucky. People thought that five years ago. Here we are 10 years in and bitcoin is more valuable or bigger than ever. 
If all these naysayers are right. Why does demand keep increasing? Why does daily volume increase. Why is there billions traded daily? How are these bitcoin companies growing into the billions of dollars in valuations?
Should we make bets on the price in a year? Or maybe just over/under today’s price? How about 5 years? If it’s going to die it’ll surely happen by then right?
I enjoy going back to these conversations years later when the price is 10x where it was when the debate occurred.

Lol digital money will eat fiats lunch because fiat has to go through so many intermediaries. Fiat is not programmable because it requires human intervention. You should probably learn how clearing houses and the vast number of other intermediaries are required for today’s banking sector.
If you want to make money why would you trade on something that’s only open half of the year? Real traders already trade in different world markets so they can trade 24/7.  They will love something that’s always open.
Why will merchants want to accept fiat credit cards if digital money can be accepted for free? Credit cards cost merchants 3%. The only reason they accept it today is because consumers like to use credit cards and merchants want to accept however a customer is willing to pay. If customers are all hodling bitcoin, they will accept it in a heartbeat. 
Why would anyone hold fiat if it loses value every day when you could hold something that’s inflation proof?
Bitcoin has a long way to go before it can compete with fiat and for society to trust it. Trust in how it works will take time. First the people who understand code trust it, then investors speculate, then laymen jump on to save money. This is a generational thing. Not something that happens overnight or even in the first decade. But you only have to look at the macro trends to see where we are going.

You were told taxes went down but in reality 25% tariffs actually mean we’re all being taxed much more than before.
Also those tariffs are being used to subsidize agriculture so free market be damned.
At the same time as cutting taxes (tariffs are going to subsidies) he’s increasing spending on walls and other nonsense so deficit spending is skyrocketing.
Unemployment is low but he wants to lower interest rates and increase printing. 
These are all disastrous long term policies for short term political wins. Trump supporters are smarter than his propaganda and need to stand up when trump does something stupid. They like sticking it to liberals more than standing up for what is best for the country. Trump listens to his followers. They need to direct trump away from bad economic and foreign policies.

To add to the other people who commented, the thought is once most of the small day to day transactions of bitcoin moves to lightning, it will free up space on the main chain which lowers fees. 
So instead of every transaction costing 30 bucks you now have one transaction for 1-5 bucks to open a channel, as many lightning transactions you want costing 1 cent each, and then one 1-5 dollar transaction to close the channel some time in the future. 
One thing I wonder about is why ever close the channel? Is there a time limit where you have to? It seems way more convenient to just always have it open.

This is so much more benign than the hate speech that regulars the Jones show. It was pre-2003. Do you remember that time? Even the most liberal peace loving people were screaming for justice against 9/11. People were signing up in droves to the military. The times are human too and they got caught up in the Fervor. You said their lies is what caused the Iraq war. Where is the lie? Not in your article or any of your quotes. How did it cause the Iraq war? It didn’t. The times is not all powerful capable of dictating public opinion. Maybe a small subset but it’s laughable you think the right takes any notice of what the times writes.
Jones is evil. Spewing hate to stoke discontent and make more money. He lies which has real consequences. He spews lies about victims much like the westboro Baptist church, lies about public figures, lies about the moon landing, 9/11, Oklahoma bombing, sandy hook. These lies hurt real people. The people who are a subject of these lies have to move due to death threats because idiots believe him. The biggest idiot of them all who is completely taken in by Jones is the president. Just let that sink in a moment.

This comment is dumb. If bitcoin we’re losing users, because it was a fad, or just wont catch on with the general public due to difficulty of use and the initial users get discouraged then that would affect the number of people willing to invest in miners. Hashrate always going up is a sign of growth in the network. It’s not a forgone conclusion. Just look at the hashrate of other coins.

If you think the us government has the ability to shut down the Bitcoin network then you simply haven't looked into Bitcoin enough (edit: I hope that didn't come off as condescending, I didn't mean it that way). The Bitcoin network has surpassed the point where that is possible. Every day the network gets stronger. 
Also don't forget, it really doesn't matter what one country does or even the entire western countries under US influence. It's sometimes hard to think about things on a global scale but Bitcoin is global. If Bitcoin catches on in China and Russia and western countries block it then there's nothing the US gov can do about it. Except as soon as those western countries see how they are being left behind (technologically) they will change their tune especially when Russia and China are innovating on the global block chain.

Downloading movies is illegal. Has the government been able to stop people from torrenting movies? (They've certainly tried but that's the beauty of peer to peer.)  Bitcoin has utility that will be used. Not every government will ban Bitcoin and where they have lax laws there will be miners who maintain the network. As well as people who live in places with strict laws who want to be rebels. 
Yes Starbucks may not ever accept it if it's illegal but that doesn't matter. People will hold Bitcoin to store value if they lose confidence in fiat with negative rates and huge deficits. People will use it to transmit money across borders to relatives. It saves them tons of money so they will do it regardless of its legality. 
Price will be higher sooner if governments stay out of the way. But Bitcoin won't die as long as it has utility.
@_date: 2018-09-15 23:47:25


It was a hypothetical situation illustrating that hashrate is going up because we’re still growing even though the price is decreasing. Hashrate doesn’t always just go up. I never said I was quoting you.


No ROI if the price is zero or approaching zero. 


I never said that. Miners mine for profit. If adoption slows or goes away price falls. If bitcoin price falls enough miners stop mining. 
My whole point is that hashrate does not always go up. Just because it generally has in the past only shows that we’re in a growing network. If for any reason that network begins to shrink, then hashrate will also shrink.

Yes. It is priced correctly.

The number of industries and markets this asset can disrupt are staggering. Which is why, if bitcoin continues to improve, then today’s value is severely underpriced.

Think of it this way. If you as a regular citizen did a bunch of research on a company and it’s stock and discovered  something no one else knows, should you be able to trade on that information? Most would say yes. It’s not like you worked for the company and had access to company decisions in real time. You just did your due diligence like any other trader would do. Now instead of trading on that information (or on top of trading it) you also sell it to your friends at a hefty price. And then once they have traded on that info you then write a blog about it and make money on advertisers. It’s not illegal to know something no one else does when you just did your research. 
Now if you got that research from an employee and traded on the employees behave or paid him then that would be insider trading. It depends on how that information was obtained.

As the world becomes more green (hydro, solar, wind, etc) it drives the cost of electricity of those sources down. I’ve read that solar is already cheaper than coal in many places. Bitcoin mining is highly mobile and moves to the cheapest energy source available to garner the highest profit from bitcoin. As the world goes green so does bitcoin. Bitcoin already either uses mostly green sources or uses excess energy from plants that are wasted anyway during non peak times.

There are significant reasons to compromise. Miners are a big part of this network that we are all apart of and they just want to be heard. We need to bring people together to move forward. Listen and compromise in safe ways that strengthen the network. BU is not safe. But compromising in ways that doesn't hurt decentralization is possible and then we can get segwit and lightning. Once those are online we won't have people complaining about transaction costs and speed. We just need to come together to get those thru.

It's not an outrageous request. We can provide that with segwit and lightning. They feel slighted and have gotten enough power to cause delays but they aren't trying to destroy Bitcoin. This is not some grand conspiracy. We just need to work together to come to an agreement. Be adults.

But the fact that someone who claims to have already matched his predictions and events up can't provide a skeptic with the links is quite dubious to say the least.
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:07:49
I don't think it was a stupid statement. We need groups of all kind to come forward with their intentions in order to reach true consensus. No one thinks the devs would push something intentionally corrupt. But there is serious pressure from the market for something to come out and begin to address the serious issues going forward. That pressure can cause a complicated change/update to be released before it's ready or thoroughly vetted. Either way both segwitness and a block increase needs to happen. I really don't care in which order as long as it comes out soon and begins to put the fears of the market at rest.
EDIT: also I want to say that I don't think the devs would put something out before it's ready. Which is why I don't think anyone would block its incorporation. Segwit and bigger block both have large majority consensus. Everyone just wants to see the system moving forward and not stalling.
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:26:30
I agree with this as someone completely against BU. It's an understated point that there are efficiencies that could be had in the block size as well. I don't think they should be entirely market base because it may lead to centralization (increasing too quickly). Also I think keeping the blocksize artificially low pushes optimization innovation which is much more exciting than a blocksize increase. Lightning for example is awesome because of its promise of low fees and instantaneous confirmations. No matter what, if you increase the block size to infinity, the conf time is still 10 min and for that reason can never be an ideal payment channel (can never compete with legacy payment companies).
I think once the code is optimized and third layer solutions emerge, I could support a steady slow block size increase to find the optimal size between between block and fee size.

@_date: 2016-01-26 12:30:14
Yes I am aware there is not a fee required. The fee is pennies which I am happy to pay for the reason posted above. Including a fee also ensures your transaction will be on the next block. I consciously include a fee. Enjoy saving your penny and waiting for confirmation.

The fee makes it less attractive for spammers to move small amounts of coins millions of times and thus clogging up the network. A small fee helps deter that kind of action. I will continue to pay a fee as long as it's reasonable.

@_date: 2017-03-24 10:38:36
Your assumption is either block size increase or no capacity increase at all (I think you included segwit and that's it). This is a terrible assumption. Your ignoring second layer scaling which increases transactions exponentially instead of linearly and still keeps cheap nodes. Miners get paid more (not less) in the medium time scale (a year maybe) due to the massive increase in low cost transactions. 
Big blocks change Bitcoin too much imo. It changes who can have a node. It assumes we are always gonna have 10 min confirm times, it assumes centralizations of nodes in data centers which goes against the principles of a trustless system.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:59:34
No one wants to delete Bitcoin. Everyone in this debate is human, we forget that when we communicate thru a screen. Compromise is possible. We're not gonna ruin decentralization with a small safe block increase (not necessarily thru a hardfork) or some other compromise given to the miners (done by core of course, I wouldn't trust anyone else). A deal can be made. Once segwit and lightning come online, transactions will be cheap and quick and everyone's concerns will be alleviated. We just have to get there.

It all comes down to the results of the tests. If it has serious issues during the test or isn't test thoroughly enough, then the miners will resist it.

Well a house loses value with time. Land increases value. If you maintain your house (added cost) then you’ll see overall property value increase but that’s only because you are constantly upgrading the house to counteract it losing value. Also assuming constant or increasing demand for homes in your area which is a good assumption in most places in the country due to population increase. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:47:22
The big difference is at the bank. Whether it’s bitcoin or dollars you probably need a loan to buy a house. 
So what’s the difference between a bitcoin bank and a dollar bank. Well presumably the bitcoin bank can’t make bitcoin out of thin air. So it can only lend the bitcoin it has in its vault. The dollar bank can loan basically an infinite amount of money. So the dollar bank lends to anyone where the bitcoin bank is careful who they lend to to ensure they make a return  on interest so they can grow and continue lending.
The economy with infinite lending is going to cause a housing bubble. People will buy more homes, homes they can’t afford. This pushes home values higher creating a bubble.
The bitcoin economy has less home owners because you must meet many more requirements to get a loan. In this economy a lot more people will just save for a home out right instead of using loans at all. (Savings is higher in a deflationary currency). But either way there is no artificial demand for house hence no housing bubble.

They never said they would block segwit. They said it won't be enough (effectively 1.3 or 1.6 mb increase) and that they aren't confident it will be ready any time soon without bugs. If it came out tomorrow and was proven to work I don't think they would block it but they would still push for a block increase to 2mb. 
And I agree with them. I want to see both segwit get pushed when it's ready and I want to see a block increase.

Your advocating people buy alt coins after a exponential rise. Terrible advice. Every time an asset booms like your seeing it inevitably busts hard. See Bitcoin 2013. When it corrects it may very well be higher than it started but it will still return to the alt coin trend line. And the people who bought now will be under water for a while. Sentiment always rocks back and forth. Right now is a great time to buy Bitcoin (blood in the streets) and a great time to sell altcoins. 
I made over 600% in my small amount of Alts and I recently sold all of them for Bitcoin  at 960. Buy low sell high. I guarantee you will be left holding the alt bag. Until the next cycle.

A doubling of fees is just the beginning. As core continues to kick the can down the road, transaction volume constantly increases. People will have to keep outbidding each other with their fees to ensure verification. It's a terrible negative feedback loop until the fees become high enough to discourage transaction growth and the system reaches equilibrium. I agree this will happen over time but I would like to see core act with some urgency.
I would much rather core implement a block increase instead of a hard fork but my confidence in them decreases daily.
@_date: 2019-03-29 18:25:39
Yes exactly. You build equity in the house while letting the banks money lose value to inflation. Then when you want to sell you recoup any money you put into the house plus any amount the property appreciated minus all the bank fees and crap and use that as a down payment on the next house and take out a bigger loan from the bank so that can lose value too lol.

No it’s not. Privacy is a big theme in upcoming upgrades. It’s also a huge part of lightning which is what most people will interact with when using bitcoin for purchases.


No one has said bitcoin is ready for the mainstream. It’s why there wasn’t mass adoption in Greece a few years ago and why there isn’t mass adoption in Venezuela. There is however a huge increase in use in Venezuela compared to other countries its size which is a good indication people there are using it at a much higher percentage than the rest of the world and that’s due to their domestic economic situation. With no power there were still stories of people sending it via sms but of course it becomes a bit harder. One day you will very likely be able to send it easily with or without power.

Haha wat? You make one bold claim after another like it’s fact without any understanding. In what way is bitcoin tied to anything? It’s literally called an UNCORRELATED asset. 


No. Bitcoin’s price will not change in that scenario. The dollar will. For example: if everything in the world were denominated in btc. And what you described happens. Everything will still be priced the same in btc. Only things priced in dollars will have any change. This shows that bitcoin is unaffected by anything the dollar does. It literally doesn’t matter what bitcoins are priced in dollars or yen or euros or whatever. It only matters what purchasing power the unit of exchange has. Economics 101.


Wow again very wrong. If I give you 1 pizza and I cut it into 8 slices how many pizzas do you have. Ok now if I give you another pizza and cut that into 20 slices how many pizzas do you have? In each case you still have one pizza regardless of how many slices you do. Same with bitcoin. It doesn’t matter how much you slice it up. 1 bitcoin will be worth x with each slice worth a piece of 1 while bitcoin. Supply is still fixed. And it is the best thing since sliced bread because literally nothing on this planet has a supply as fixed as bitcoin.

Jesus Christ. Please read a fucking economics book. I hope you’re a teenager. So let me ask you this. Since bitcoin is denominated in every currency (dollars, euros, etc) if the dollar loses value by one percent and the euro gains value by one percent. What happened to bitcoin? It’s priced in both euros and dollars. I’ll wait while you pick up your exploded brain off the floor.
I’ll give you the answer. Nothing happened to bitcoin because it’s not tied to the dollar or any fiat in any way. The price in dollars is irrelevant to the value of bitcoin. 


What the fuck are you talking about. Your answer completely changed the premise of your previous response. You claimed the dollar is tied to bitcoin. And now you don’t even mention the dollar. Of course if the world uses bitcoin, and it increases in value by 1000 then yes you would be paid less satoshis but it would be worth exactly the same, ie the smaller amount of btc you receive for your work buys the same amount of food. But guess what, even though you are paid less units, your savings is now worth 1000 times more. And your income is unchanged.
Your problem is you’re too hung up on the number itself. You should be thinking in terms of what can I buy with this amount of currency. Whether it’s dollars or yen or pounds or bitcoin. It doesn’t matter the price between them. The dollar might be stronger than the euro because of something the US did to make it stronger or maybe because the UK did something to weaken the pound. It doesn’t matter either way if you think of it’s purchasing power. It doesn’t matter what the euro is worth in dollars. It only matters how many widgets you can buy with one unit of currency.


Ok so you’ve never read an economics book or a history book. Please go do some research before you claim to understand something. How about the pound? The franc? Guilder? Those were all world reserve currencies before the dollar.

Jesus Christ dude. I never said anything about what I think about corporations and what they do. They do a lot of things I think are shit but that doesn’t mean you can use the first amendment against them.
If you want to make it so corporations can’t discriminate on the basis of speech then pass a law that says so. It’s inappropriate to use the first amendment to pretend like they are doing something unconstitutional. Because you are misreading the constitution.
The first amendment protects you (and any group) from a law being passed by Congress that limits your speech. Such as making certain speech illegal and arresting people for it. That’s serious because you lose your liberty based on something you said. That’s the first amendment. 
It doesn’t mean a business has to keep you on their platform when you say controversial shit.

If it’s true a 5 bedroom house is 1 million dollars in Cali and only 300k in Kentucky then the percentages you speak of favor my argument that cali is just outrageously higher than the rest of the country. 
If we assume a 5br house is 300k in Kentucky then that’s 6.2 times the median household income. If it’s a million in Cali then that’s 13.93 times the household median income.

It’s really not necessary. Recessions are cyclical. We’ve had a central bank for a 100 years now and we still have recessions. They only thing central banks affect is the perception of society. Which does have a huge affect on the economy but you can affect people’s perception whether you use bitcoin or dollars. Changing the monetary base is just going to make things worse in the long run.
You’ll still be able to borrow and lend on bitcoin. And you won’t need traditional banks to do so. You’re already seeing that today with crowd funding and peer lending and things like that online. You might choose to get a loan from a traditional bank but you don’t have to.

Today people buy Bitcoin mostly due to speculation. But everyone has a price to lock in profits. As the price rises more people people buy. It's the nature of markets.
Once you have billions and billions of dollars in one place, it only makes sense and is natural for merchants to want a piece of that pie. They will offer products and services for that pie. People will use it because they have it and it has less friction than other means. All of this will occur over time as the market matures. It's a positive feedback loop.

I would say evidence disagrees with your assertion that no one will spend it. It seems abundantly clear by the exponential transaction curve that people are spending it. 
It's obvious that people sell appreciating assets all the time. Price goes up, people lock in profits and miss out on future profits. This happens even more when that asset can be used immediately as a benefit for the consumer. For example if I get a discount by using it or it's cheaper to send over seas then a money wire service. If a rational consumer can save money they will. That means both saving it and spending it when it is profitable. 
Your argument of Keynesian economics is flawed. Are you asserting no one saves dollars because it loses value over time?

That is the definition of an uncorrelated asset. You don’t get to have it both ways. When I say it’s uncorrelated, I’m using the professional term. Even if In some instances both prices go in the same direction, it doesn’t change the fact that it is an uncorrelated asset.

Believe me. I understand completely the value of having money liquid either in cash or in a cash account at a bank. You completely missed my point and the conversation thread above. OP was implying that people won't spend Bitcoin because the price increases incentivizing people to hold. I said if that statement was true then the opposite must be true (which of course it's not). The opposite being no one would save money because fiat is decreasing in value over time. 
In the US (I have no idea in Australia) the common savings interest rate is near 0.03 percent with the max maybe being close to 1 percent with a lot of stipulations. Yet people still save in both cash and in savings accounts even though their value is decreasing due to inflation.
The opposite will be true in a Bitcoin world. Yes the incentive is to save but people will still spend for all the reasons in my previous comments.

This is also semantics. How something is used defines whether it is a commodity or currency. Currently it has more traits of a commodity. It is being used as a store of value like gold. It is being speculated to one day be a currency or a medium of exchange. Obviously in some cases it's used as a medium of exchange but today that utility is limited.


Yes Bitcoin has the utility I mentioned above.


Not sure what you mean here? 


So you agree. The commodity 'gold' is very similar to Bitcoin. Are you considering gold to have intrinsic value?


This is also no different than Bitcoin. Bitcoin takes resources in the form of computing hardware and electricity to make more. Bitcoin goes one step further and will taper new coins. Gold doesn't have this trait. It is also priced in dollars. Not sure why that matters. Anything is priced in all currencies. 


No he has no point. You have fallen victim to an appeal to authority. Everything is at the whim of the market. Markets are only buyers and sellers. If one day no one wants bananas and the demand goes to zero then you have no buyers. Obviously the price tanks. Bitcoin is a market like any other.

Honestly if your really trying to be shady, OPs advice is the best way to go. Take a second mortgage on the house. Take the 150k and buy Bitcoin and then walk away from the house. This is really the only way to not have anything reported to the IRS. Your credit will probably be shit for 7 years or whatever but if you don't need a loan for a while it doesn't matter. Or just buy everything for the next few years in your wife's name who would still have good credit. 
Honestly though, I wouldn't do this. With that kind of money I would just talk to a tax lawyer on both sides of the pond and just try to sell it legitimately. Claim the income on both sides. And pay what I'm due. If you ever are caught, the consequences are huge. Seizing of all your family assets, Jail time, etc. it's worth it to just pay a big bill. At 150k you would still end up with a 100k after the tax man takes 1/3. Just get into the mindset that you only have 100k not 150k.

When Bitcoin was new and a cool experiment it was cool to use 0-conf to buy stuff with little risk. After all that taco place saw probably 3 transactions a month in btc. If those three double spent and cheated him then who cares? It was fun to play with and talk about future possibilities. 
When it grows up and a merchant has 50% of btc transactions. 0-conf is not acceptable risk. When it's a 66 billion dollar network, risk is unacceptable. There is too much at stake. Comparing today to the past is apples and oranges. Comparing the future to today will be too. Bitcoin needs to evolve organically, securely, slowly, and probably on multiple layers and side chains to reach its potential.
And I don't think it's potential will be realized for another ten years. I think that's a big problem with Bcash supporters. Impatience.

Intrinsic value is such a farce. Nothing has value unless we assign value to it. Some things like air water and food will always have value but are either in abundance or doesn't last long and can't be held over time. Other commodities have value for their use. 
Comparing commodities to stocks is not understanding the difference.
Bitcoin like other commodities is valuable because of its use. You can use it to transfer large sums of money across borders with no middleman. You can use it to store money without the risk of intermediaries or third party risk. It is also being speculated to be useful in the future in many other markets like real estate, micro transactions, cloud storage, smart contracts, etc etc. obviously if those future endeavors don't pan out the price will lower to align with expectations.
All things have value from use, and value from speculation of future use. Some things have more speculation than others.

It's not hard at all. And you have a ten minute window to get the second transaction to the mem pool before the first transaction is included in a block. You could literally make your purchase, get your receipt, turn around and double spend with a higher fee (as easy as clicking a button in an app) and then walk out with a free coffee. If it's easy and can save money then plenty of people will use it. Enough that will undermine the merchant's "trust" on accepting 0-conf.
Here is a crude example of a tool. It could be easily streamlined and put in an app.

You make the mistake of thinking it's google vs yahoo when it reality it's google vs Amazon. They are two different things and both will succeed. I think as an investment you'll be better off with Bitcoin. Ethereum has no limit, it's not as secure, and 75% is owned by devs and early investors. Very few are traded. Buterin himself wants the price lower. It will be more widely used for the tech as you mention but the price will be inflated to keep the gas low imo.

I kinda of disagree with both you and the OP you responded to. Bitcoin is completely uncorrelated to the stock market. If there’s a crash in the market I don’t think it will effect bitcoin either way. I do lean toward it affecting bitcoin negatively if you are in a position of losing your home or other such bankruptcy, then you would sell any asset you have to cover the debt, including bitcoin and stocks. But I would argue most people would ditch stocks before bitcoin.

Highly likely? Yea right. Based on what? 
Every day for decades the debt ratio is the highest it’s ever been. That’s not an indicator for economic Armageddon. I’m willing to bet the next recession happens before 2020 and that it will be smaller than 2008. 
You say nothing has changed since 2008 and that’s not true. The banks aren’t nearly leveraged like they were. Not because of regulation but because they don’t want to get caught with their pants down again with 2008 fresh in everyone’s memory.

Have you tried to ask him to withdrawal a small amount maybe 100-500 bucks to show him it's impossible to realize the gains? That is the biggest test, in Bitcoin there are dozens of ways to convert your coins to any currency of your choice (exchanges, peer to peer companies, atms, etc). With one coin it is impossible to withdrawal real money. If you can, try to pull as much out of the account that's in your name as possible.

Most mining comes from renewable sources. The minority comes from coal but uses excess coal energy. These miners park their warehouses right next to the plant. The coal plant is designed for peak energy load because coal cannot ramp up and down quickly with demand. So it just hums along at peak energy output so when everyone gets off work you don’t end up with brown outs. This excess energy is usually just wasted. Bitcoin miners go to the plant next door and asks for a cheaper rate to use the excess energy. This gives them an edge in mining because it reduces their operating cost (cheaper electricity than anyone else). And it’s a plus for the plants because they are now receiving funding from energy that was previously lost.

Sure. In most cases the merchant takes risk due to fraud in credit card transactions (except in person transactions with a chip, in those cases visa is responsible). 
The question is, when Bitcoin and Bcash are both mature and the merchant gets to choose between fiat credit cards, 0-conf Bcash, and lightning. Which will they choose? 
For online purchases, the merchant is still responsible for fraud when taking credit cards even with a chip. Apps can be made to easily double spend automatically when using 0-conf. And the merchant assumes 0 risk with decentralized lightning. The best option for both in person and online purchases is lightning.

Bitcoin went 12$ to 1200$ then crashed to 200$. Then the next bubble took it to 20,000$. That’s 100X again (20,000/200).
This time is no different. People ALWAYS say “this time is different”. Those people just haven’t been around long enough.

Yes most people don’t get this. These bubbles have happened over and over again. The new people who are brought in during the surge are always so upset during the correction. Each time the correction usually goes over 80% but it never touches the previous ATH.
So that would put the bottom in around 3-4K. And it’s not time to panic unless it gets to 1200 (previous ATH).

Hey man, you’re in the bitcoin sub. I know you have a good understanding of economics and history (at least history of money lol).
That’s cool. Your passionate and engaged which is awesome. But please try not to fall into that trap of believing they’re evil. They aren’t. Maybe misinformed on some subjects but they are probably more informed in others. 
It’s important to step back and see actual people in these roles. Also see the manipulation that’s happening towards both sides (they amplify the frustration you feel when you understand something and they don’t). In the long view the pendulum of democracy swings back and forth but both sides equal each other out. It’s wisdom of large numbers that makes democracy great.
By the way liberal is a wide spectrum. For example I consider myself on the left who has a firm grasp on macro economics and Austrian economics (which is why I’m involved in bitcoin). I’d buy you a beer and love to talk about the free market. Be excellent my friend.

You need to learn to stop fluffing up your opinion at an attempt to convince people you are intelligent. No one is going to read your book of a comment when your point was sufficiently stated in a sentence.
Trump doesn’t think about consequences of actions. He just reacts to perceived threats. Bitcoin being one of them because it would hinder his ability to manipulate the dollar against other national currencies. He doesn’t understand macro economics, or Austrian economics, or trade wars, or even how people of other cultures will react to his policies. That’s why he seems to change course all the time.

I hear women on the left say they were scared to support Hillary too. There was a lot of vitriol from trump supporters who thought Hillary was evil towards women who supported her.

If she had met him in another context I bet they would have gotten along just fine. It happens to both sides in order to divide the country.

Yep absolutely. They are all competing to be the democratic presidential candidate. Shady shit goes on to try to get an advantage to gain power. Same thing happens in republican primaries (this year there won’t be because trump is running again). But trump will do shady stuff and so will other republicans. 
Just remember if you have bought into an entire side being evil, it’s because your getting most of your information from the people who want you to think that. If you lean left you mostly see stuff about how evil republicans are. You’re not dumb and neither are the left who see only stuff about how evil the right is. But you and them and me are actively being manipulated. Most of it’s not true, or highly skewed, or taken out of context. Sometimes it’s good to step back and see what’s happening to both sides. Then it’s clear the misinformation out there and try to remember most people are good. Your neighbor the trump guy is probably a really nice dude and the liberal across the street is probably really nice and helpful. Don’t forget we’re all in this together!

But the pendulum tends to swing back and forth in a democracy to even stuff out in the long run. Just gotta step back to see it. In the mean time we just have to  be excellent to each other. Sounds like you lean right and I lean left. That’s cool because we have different ideas and probably balance each other out in a democracy.

You’re not brainwashed (it was a harsh term) but you and I are actively being manipulated. You lean a certain way and because of that the things you see lead you to believe the other side is evil. You are shown things that build on that belief that pushes your buttons and makes you angrier and angrier. But here’s the thing, the left sees the exact same things. Except they see all the evil things republicans are doing.
Mostly what you’re seeing is not true, or it’s highly skewed, or taken out of context. Same goes for the things on the left. 
There’s corruption sure but there’s not really any more corruption from one side more than the other. It’s just about what your shown. But in reality, that trump supporter next door is probably really chill and a lot of fun and that liberal neighbor across the street is probably really nice and goes out of their way to be helpful. (Not those specific traits, you can substitute any positive trait lol). We just have to remember to be excellent to each other.

That’s why we have two systems in the US. Social security is just like you described and owned by the federal government. No one knows how much is in that pot so everyone assumes the payments from the working ages people are going straight to retirement people and it’s a problem because there will be more retirement people than working people very soon.
Secondly we have the tax incentive retirement accounts that are usually set up and managed by the company. That one the individual can decide what your fund tracks (like bonds or s&amp;p500) and when you retire you can pull it out to live on.
Most millennials don’t think we’ll get much from the federal social security payout so we invest as much as we can in the 401k retirement accounts managed by the company. Some people are also lucky enough to have a pension too but those are going away.

You’re not brainwashed (it was a harsh term) but you and I are actively being manipulated. You lean a certain way and because of that the things you see lead you to believe the other side is evil. You are shown things that build on that belief that pushes your buttons and makes you angrier and angrier. But here’s the thing, the left sees the exact same things. Except they see all the evil things republicans are doing.
Mostly what you’re seeing is not true, or it’s highly skewed, or taken out of context. Same goes for the things on the left. 
There’s corruption sure but there’s not really any more corruption from one side more than the other. It’s just about what your shown. But in reality, that trump supporter next door is probably really chill and a lot of fun and that liberal neighbor across the street is probably really nice and goes out of their way to be helpful. (Not those specific traits, you can substitute any positive trait lol). We just have to remember to be excellent to each other. Each side balances each other out and creates a balance in the pendulum of democracy in the long term.

Risk/reward doesn’t make it worth it. Bitcoin has increased more than 100% each year except one. If 100% gains aren’t enough and you’re increasing risk to get even higher gains then you are flirting with greed/gambling.

The Democratic Party are just people who share similar ideas. There’s no more corruption from the Democratic Party than the Republican Party. Again neither are evil and both want what is best for the US. The rhetoric of one being more evil than the other is just propaganda from people who want to divide the country (either for political reasons or because they want to attack the US as a whole).
And although there is corruption on both sides, it’s there because people (human nature) will look for loopholes and gaps in laws (or even break unenforced laws) in order to gain power. That’s why it’s on both sides because power is corrupting. It’s human nature and why we built a democracy to balance and hinder corruption from power as much as possible.

Lol no thanks Nano salesman. Bitcoin drives demand for people hunting out the cheapest possible electricity to make the most money mining. This drives innovation in energy production and optimizes the current energy production.
Massive coal energy plants can’t spool up and down easily to meet demand. So they always produce at peak levels to ensure no brown/black outs. Most mining operations (in China) Park right next to these energy plants and buys the excess power on the cheap. That power would have been wasted anyway. I’ve yet to hear about new coal plants opening up to meet mining demand. So I’m not sure bitcoin mining really adds much to the carbon footprint.
On top of this most mining is around natural energy production to capture the cheapest rates. This is usually hydro plants and geothermal plants. Or of course solar.

When there wasn’t a block size limit there were so few users that the max the mempool ever got was like 100kb. So it’s false to say it went from infinity to 1, realistically it went from 100kb to 1 mb.
Bigger blocks doesn’t hurt what they are working on. It hurts the fundamental use case of bitcoin. Decentralization. Now it’s not binary, it’s a sliding scale. Could we go from 1 to 2 without destroying the fundamentals? Probably. But it’s a waste of time when there are things that can be done that both increases functionality without hurting decentralization. Why waste time on a worse solution? 
If the market really wants bigger blocks they can use alt coins or Bcash now. I like that core is working on real solutions.

Satoshi bothered with the block size limit because it was a valid hypothetical attack vector. Everything in those days was hypothetical.
Yes I agree the block size is relatively easy, although it was evidently harder than bch people made it seem as evidenced from all the issues they had in the beginning.
I’m not saying go use a competitor just for the sake of using it. I’m saying it’s a free market. There are other options so it doesn’t make sense to weaken the original chain unnecessarily. If people want big blocks then bch will win. If people want real solutions then btc will win. To me it’s that simple. Its not hypothetical anymore trying to figure out how many people value each solution. We will know over time because one chain will pull away from the other. Or each one will fit in a niche market. Either way is acceptable to me.

Nope you’re delusional. Once again you brought up Silicon Valley. How can I move the goal post when you are changing topics faster than anyone could keep up. 
Immigrants are one of the main reason this country has been as successful as it is. It brings ideas from all over the world who cultivate those ideas into products that we as a country enjoy the fruits of.
Eliminating the flow of people into this country cuts off its legs and would result in that brain trust moving to more open countries. 
Back to my original point, women entering the workplace doubled the supply side of the labor force. No labor market had an influx of immigrants that come close to that. But you can’t blame women because having two incomes really made a household better off. Until wages stagnated for twenty years of course and inflation caught up. 
Blaming immigrants is just easy. So slow people use it to gain political points. Maybe one day you’ll turn off the right wing conspiracies and join people with intellect who look at facts and not blaming what’s easy.

Also try to understand that bitcoin really works as a store of value currently. Treat it as a savings account.   The other comments about fees being lower on other wallets is true but it still sucks paying a 20c fee on small transactions especially if you just want to move money around.
Bitcoin is still new and it takes time to build the infrastructure. Eventually all the perks you get with credit cards and free transfers will make it on bitcoin on higher layers. But it takes time. You are an early user. Just like the internet in the early days was clunky, but after years of layer and infrastructure building we are always connected and prices have fallen.

The previous bubbles aren’t exactly all the same but they are close enough to make me feel confident for a prediction. If you look at all the bubbles, some went a little further than the others. Which gives a nice range. This range is between 8k and 10k (we may have already topped since we hit 7990 but I don’t think we’re quite there yet). With everything that’s going on I would put my money on the upper end of that range. I think early next year we will close in on 10 k but probably won’t break it. This will be the top. And I expect the price to retreat over the next 6-12 months to a low of 2-4k. Again probably on the higher side of that range. Then consolidation until 2020. The next halving would be a great catalyst for a beginning to the next bubble.
This should have a consolidation around 3-4K which puts the next bubble around 90k-120k. If you hold during that dip, buying at 10k will still pay off.

It is in a bubble. Bitcoin has had about 5 major bubbles in its life. Each time it increases about 30X and then deflated about 50-80%. But each consecutive bubble makes the previous one look like a little blip. So buying at the peak of one bubble just means you have to wait for the next bubble to make a profit. That’s why holding is the best advice. If you panic you’ll lose money. If you hold you would have always ended up in the green, and by a lot.
So buying now is fine IMO. Just dollar cost average and hold.
My prediction from looking at all the previous bubbles is this. The last large consolidation was around 300. 30x puts the price around 9000 so I think we are on the last big push up in this bubble. I will not be selling but I have reduce my buys a bit in anticipation for a pull back. I expect the price will reach 9000 (plus or minus) by next year and then pull back to 2-3k. I don’t sell but I will be buying up everything I can around the 3000 level. That probably won’t be until 2019 or so though.

A lot of people on r/bitcoin are trumpets (republicans who blindly follow the party). Some are straight from T_D subreddit. Which is why it’s not getting a big response. But many many people are worried, just look at the front page. 
As for bitcoin, I don’t think it will be affected much. I think net neutrality will be tied up in litigation for years. It will get a massive push back. The nice thing about our country is the separation of powers. Even though trumps fcc plant has removed the fcc rule there are many routes freedom can take. Congress can pass a law (which is why we have been blowing up our representatives phones) that solidifies net neutrality and over rules the FCC. Or our judicial branch could rule that FCC violated some existing law when removing net neutrality which would also overrule the FCC. Or we just wait until the next president and he/she appoints a better FCC chair and they change the FCC rules.
But assuming all that fails, it would be years (decades) after all the law suites and all this cools off before ISPs could dare to take advantage of the FCC rule. By then hopefully the bitcoin network is big enough and robust enough to have work arounds from ISP throttling and blocking.  I have faith in our democracy/republic that freedom will prevail especially if it harms our competitiveness with other countries.

The trump admin believes first and foremost to do the opposite of the obama admin and second to remove regulations regardless of the effect. Net neutrality fits both of those points. Obama admin made net neutrality official and it’s a regulation on telecoms.
The ISPs have certainly tried to get away with throttling and blocking in the past which was met with FCC resistance and usually settled without any major fines or penalty’s. Now the fcc won’t be going after ISPs that’s true. But I think many many lawsuits will be brought against this and a judge can halt any new rules put in place until a ruling is made. Which would default us back to net neutrality. Until the law suites are completed. This is just like the travel ban.

It will 100% go under 7000 again. I’m willing to bet bitcoin will reach 9000 soon and then correct big time. There is no asset that can rise this much this fast without a major correction. I’m willing to bet we see consolidation between 2000 and 4000 before the end of  2019. 
But!! I am long term bullish. The next big bubble will begin its liftoff around 2020. Coincidentally around the next halving.

My not keeping up is a function of your incoherent arguments and incorrectly assigned rebuttals. Talking nonsense and then pat yourself on the back when everyone is confused is a lovely strategy.
Ah you vote in democratic primaries. Cool cool. Easy when there aren’t any republicans to vote for.


Ah I see, “I swear I can’t vote the other way because there aren’t any options” lol.
I voted for John McCain, Obama, Gary Johnson, and more recently my current republican mayor. 
It’ll probably be along time before I vote republican in a national election again based on the direction they are going though. John McCain is what seems to be the end of “country over party.”
I’m glad to see you voted for an attorney general but I would love to see that level of discretion all the way up. You are certainly better than most in that regard but obviously still toe the line. You can’t be libertarian and vote trump.

I live in Florida where there is a lot of sun but also cheap power. 
I’m not saying everyone needs to run out and but electric now. I’m saying everyone needs to be informed and understand what’s really going on, exactly so they can make informed decisions in the future.


I’m asking did you look at the data first before forming an opinion. It’s only reasonable to wait on forming an opinion until you’ve seen the facts. The problem is how much propaganda is out there. People form opinions based on the propaganda and feel like they’re informed. But reality doesn’t care about anyone’s feelings.


No they’ve always been better cars. They are just now getting competitive in price with ICE cars.


Have you ever asked yourself WHY Tesla exists and why solar and battery has become affordable all of a sudden? It’s because of Elon musk and his economies of scale. It’s the only reason these things are affordable. And they have to be affordable for adoption to happen. Why did Elon do this? [Because he understands climate change is an existential threat. ](
If someone hadn’t shown Elon the data, he wouldn’t have dedicated his life to creating a solution. The solution doesn’t have to come from government. But it does have to come from informing the people of the truth so they can make informed decisions. Whether that decision is buying a Tesla, or starting the next company that rivals Tesla in sustaining our future.
Lastly I don’t blame anyone for not running out and buying a Tesla. Personal finance for most people is not great and I’ve been blessed. What I do blame people for is making an ill informed decision without looking at the data. Being informed is enough in this case. Or claiming that climate science is FUD when they haven’t taken the time to just look at what the data actually says.

Let me ask you something. Do you believe in Newtonian physics? If I told you we tracked an asteroid on a collision course with earth in X years would you react the same way? Denial?
It sounds like you believe in cancer. If twenty doctors told you that you had cancer and you needed chemo to live. Would you react the same way? Denial?
It’s not hysteria to look at the data. Have you read the report?
Yes I own solar (because I’m an engineer and I think it’s cool, I’m libertarian and wanted to live off grid, I’m cheap and hate paying power companies, and I understand the impact of global warming).
Yes I own a Tesla (because it’s a superior car, and because I understand the problems with global warming).
Spreading information on the subject without hysteria and backed by the data is important because if the masses don’t accept it, then people in power (both industry and government) also won’t accept it. 
Are you of a scientific background? Do you tend to make decisions on things without knowing as much information as you can  on the subject first?
This is not a partisan issue. If you actually read the data before forming an opinion you would see it’s not FUD.

Wow what a jump in logic. Is your neck ok after that whiplash?
Of course miners secure the network for bitcoin. But they only sell what they need to cover costs. The rest are held. Miners believe bitcoin is going up like everyone else. They will mine more and more, even at a loss, to acquire more bitcoin. Because they know it may be a loss now, but in 6 months that held bitcoin could be at a huge profit. So hash rate can easily and does surpass the price. And then the price follows because there is now more security to allow for more value in the network. It’s a positive feedback loop.
@_date: 2019-12-12 05:35:15


The globe is unequivocally getting warmer. There is no denying it when looking at the data.
It’s not for anything... I’m not sure I understand your point here. Science is just accumulating data and then making predictions based on that data. It says nothing about acting hysterical or taxes. 
But data based predictions tell us where we are headed. If solutions are not developed to curb the ever increasing trend then life will drastically change in the near term for humans. It’s not hyperbole to say that. Taxes don’t mean much in a famine.


This prediction does not fit with the current data. Do you have other data that contradicts the report I posted?


I’m curious what you base this on? Is this just your feeling?


Again what are these claims based on?


Why couldn’t you conquer mars and ensure the earth is habitable for humans? It is much cheaper to fix a habitable planet than to make a uninhabitable planet habitable. 
The problem is not binary. In no means do we throw all global gdp at this problem today. But the data is the data. It’s not political even if the liberals have commandeered it for hysteria points. 
But it is important to read the report (which I can tell you haven’t done for yourself) and see how clear it is that the warming is a problem and some resources should be used to develop solutions. Carbon capture is extremely promising. I can see spending a similar amount on the earth as we do on explorations. Maybe back off some welfare spending to ensure our children have the same resources we enjoy.

Oh really? Care to make any other opinions like it’s a fact?
Yes trump. Hillary and Bernie come second. Trump has been spouting the same shit for years. And I don’t look to Democrats for responsible fiscal policies. For that I look to Republicans. I look to Democrats for providing societal good and regulating the downsides of capitalism and ensuring a level playing field for all Americans not just rich white assholes.
I know it’s weird for a lot of people but I don’t vote for a party. I vote on policies. And lately republicans have given up on the things they were good at. Such as standing up to tyrants, pushing back on Russian aggression, and responsible fiscal policies. Trump has bankrupted the Republican Party from these topics.

Again I ask you look at the data for yourself. Not only is the report out there which quantifies the confidence, but the raw data is also posted for anyone to creat their own model if they don’t like the assumptions made.
The problem is the media has completely misinformed this vast majority of people. This is both left and right media. The left takes the extremes for shock factor which completely misconstrues the data and the right denies we even live on earth. Look at the data and see for yourself!

You grossly misrepresent the free market. The market takes in all available information to value an item. Say the information is out there but only half of the country believes it. And the other half knows Florida isn’t projected to flood (beyond human management) for 50 years. On top of that, the people who believe it also believe the ignorant will be informed before that happens.
In that case the housing market could still be at all time highs (due to shorter term immigration/population/demand increase) while still being depressed from where it would have been if sea level rise weren’t happening. It won’t be until Florida is uninhabitable before the demand for housing there falls completely to zero.
I don’t know if your background is in science or not, but if it isn’t there are some really good reports on the IPCC site that explain their findings in common terms. Please take a look before forming your opinion on the matter. Or if you enjoy scientific papers please take a look at the entire report.

A flat tax is preferable to me too and I lean left. Secret tariff taxes are not that when you sell them by saying other countries will pay it. It’s lying to the American people. And it’s much higher than any tax cut received.

Denial of the facts is all I’m talking about. No one is bringing up government but you. With information, solutions follow naturally. With denial (as you’ve done) no solutions can be found.


I’m sure this sounded deep to you but it’s meaningless. Just hyperbole.


No you are just wrong here. Watch the talk between him and alibaba ceo. He states he wants much more global funding to go toward solving earth climate change and only a small sliver on mars explorations. He even states himself that it’s cheaper to fix a habitable planet than terraform an uninhabitable planet. He wouldn’t have made Tesla otherwise.
It’s obvious you are trying to square your political bias with your respect for a charismatic CEO.

It seems your beef is with the reporting on climate change. This being a bitcoin sub, we are all very aware how journalists don’t know what they are talking about. And only look for click bait headlines.

In my opinion, based on how the internet evolved, there will be only one protocol or all the silo'd protocols will interconnect. It may not be Bitcoin but based on its network effect I would put my money on Bitcoin being the winner. More than one protocol won't work. Value is based on users so as long as the biggest protocol has enough capability, people will migrate to the protocol with the most value (the one with the most people). Ethereum for example has more functionality but not users or security. What I expect to happen is one of two things, Bitcoin will upgrade to include the features of ethereum, in which case will make ethereum go away. Or Bitcoin will connect to ethereum via sidechains at which point you would never know you were even using the ethereum network and will just think your Bitcoin will do more things. Either way the token ether will be redundant.

Time to go back and learn about the history of the internet. The internet did have competitors. There were at least four different versions in the beginning, being developed by darpa, France, the U.K., and RAND corp. the TCP protocol upgraded their protocol to include the advances of all these iterations to form TCP/IP protocol and with the help of the international organization for standardization (ISO) became the dominant protocol. Newer (better) protocols were developed afterwards but never caught on due to the network effect of TCP/IP. People constantly said TCP/IP couldn't scale but every time it hit a wall a new innovation was born to give it a bit more throughput than before. 
Speaking of direct competition with incumbent institutions, people forget how entrenched the big news corporations were. Newspaper, magazine, tv, and any other information company had a firm grip on what the American (and world population) saw. They had huge incentives to push against the internet. And tried. Other corporations wanted private intranets to control what happened online and for (what they believed) was more secure. These corporations also tried to compete directly with the internet to push their intranets. Now it's easy to forget all the competitors because the internet today is vastly different from back then.
There are many correlations we can make with Bitcoin.

Yep. And I do have a trigger that is my signal that tells me I was wrong about the cycles. The last two bubbles each dropped about 80-90% during the following bear market. And the price never fell below to the previous ATHs. If it drops below the previous ATH then all bets are off. A 80-90% drop from 20k puts us in the bottom being between 2-4k. So I’ve had buys set up for the last 6 months from 4k all the way to 2k with the amount increasing as it goes to 2k. If it goes below 1200 then I’ll probably starting dumping.

The answer isn’t violence. If there is a problem with a particular group, the answer is to understand why they are being violent and try to correct the underlying problem. 
If impoverished people are stealing, do we kill or deport all poor people? No the answer is to reduce poverty to reduce the thefts. 
Same with Muslim people in the UK. There is an underlying problem that’s making these people believe violence is ok. Maybe it’s western involvement in their home countries, maybe it’s a lack of acknowledgment in western society, maybe it’s high poverty rates in that group of people, I don’t know. But the solution is not right wing extremism. Extremism is never the answer to extremism.

Which is why we should teach discipline rather than avoidance. It’s like teaching responsible sex vs abstinence. If you train people how to use something properly it’s always better than trying to scare them away from it without training how it works. Inevitably people still use them except they don’t have the training to use it properly and end up hurting themselves.


When you accrue them with a purpose your much more likely to use them. And oh by the way, it’s really up to the individual whether he wants to waste them or not.


So are you saying not to buy a car ever? What costs are you talking about between using a loan vs cash? People have to buy cars, I’m just saying it’s smarter to save your money then take out a low interest loan.


Well until no one uses cards l’ll continue to use mine. Because I’m getting a discount (points, cash back, warranties) and people using cash aren’t. The price is the same whether you use cash or not. 


It may be easier but my argument is whether it’s smarter or not.

If Bitcoin was going to die it would have happened in 2014 when the only exchange stole/lost millions of coins and went bankrupt and the ensuing correction went to 90%. 
It didn’t die then. Even though there was a ton of mainstream coverage, huge loss of confidence in the entire ecosystem, and a massive price reduction.
So tell me o’wise one. What is different this time that would make this correction worse? Has the blockchain been hacked? Was a fatal flaw uncovered? Has the developers all abandoned the project? Are miners throwing away their ASICS? No, none of that is happening. It’s just a bubble bursting and the ensuing correction is scary. Just wait it out like the last 4 bubbles.
But it sounds like you never even invested in bitcoin so I’m not even sure why your here other than spreading fear. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 10:19:47
Yes that's true. But if you keep adding debt faster than your increasing revenue (either from more taxes or a growing economy) then the interest payments become a larger and larger part of the yearly budget. At some point paying debt becomes unsustainable along with the other things the government is required to pay. It then has to choose to either default on the debt, default on the other payments (military, social programs, etc), or print more money and devalue the currency to make ends meet. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:17:52

@_date: 2018-11-20 22:30:55
I don’t disagree. 
In my opinion (not that it’s worth much), the largest affect on price is still the subsidy. So we are still in a 4 year cycle. The last two bubbles lined up really well and I’m banking on it happening again (since the subsidiary is still very high). The last two ATH were beat the year of the subsidy and the the peak price was a year later. So I’m expecting 20k to be beat in 2020 (December) and then the following December would be the next peak bubble.
Adoption really grows during these rallies and then slows during the following bear market. I think adoption will continue to grow in this cyclic manner until the subsidy is closing in on zero. That’s when we should be approaching market saturation. And I don’t really expect it to be used as a currency until after that point.

No one said don’t live within your means. But you’re a sucker if you don’t use debt to your advantage. Use cards for everyday purchases and pay it off every month to avoid interest and collect points for travel (best deal worth thousands for things you would have paid in cash anyway). Not to mention fraud protection and insurance. In 2018 my wife and I have gone to DC, North Carolina cabin, England, Italy, New York, the keys, and Dominican Republic all with points (flights and hotels and rental car anyway). The points also earned me the south west companion pass which is BOGO flights. Every flight I buy (with points) I get another ticket free (for my wife). 
Use a car loan for 1.75% interest when inflation and cds and bonds are all approaching 3%. Yea I’ll use the banks money and let mine grow. 
Use interest free cards instead of buying with cash. Save money for X item. Keep money in a cd or mutual fund or whatever your risk tolerance is, and pay for item with interest free card. Pay off over 21 month 0% window. If something goes wrong you can always use your cash to pay it all off.
Debt is the responsible persons friend. Discipline and knowledge of debt is a tool to increase your wealth. Discipline should be taught when it comes to debt, not avoidance.

Um no. That might be what you want to happen but that's not reality. The principle is never paid. The payments we make on debt is only the interest. And the debt isn't getting paid off as we grow. The debt is growing faster than the nation (GDP) is growing. 
What the fed is doing is inflating the money supply which devalues the currency. Hence all that debt suddenly isn't so bad because it's not worth that much. Of course the money you owe isn't worth very much either but that's just the price the fed is willing to pay.

Greed is what drives adoption. That greed of profit gets you in the door. The store of value keeps you there. And eventually when adoption is high and L2 is built out, then merchants will begin holding and transacting in bitcoin (because they will know people are holding bitcoin and they want to accommodate any way you’re willing to pay them).

Bitcoin probably won't forever raise in value like it is today. It has to level off. When it's at full market penetration the value of Bitcoin will fluctuate very little. At this point it becomes economical to loan it out to make interest on it. Fractional reserve can't work though in Bitcoin.

Wow contradict yourself much? You’re for literacy but also do scare tactics? People can be taught but not right now? Makes no sense.
If they were taught, you wouldn’t have so much debt. Scare tactics never work. People aren’t children, only big government people think they need to protect people from themselves.


So? If I gave you $2000 a year in points would waste them? If so that’s your choice. This is a non argument.
It’s like telling someone, “I could give you this 2 grand but your just gonna waste it so I’m not going to give it to you”. Seriously? 


This makes no sense. So your saying buy the car with cash then keep spending cash over time? Wow financial genius you are. The car will depreciate whether you buy it with cash or not. You save more money by using debt then cash. It’s simple math. 
What you *should* do is save up for a car and then let your money build in a bond or cd or mutual fund and use debt on the car. There is very little risk doing that.


You like to ignore the discipline part. No you don’t spend more with discipline and training. Another moot argument.

I don’t think we will see another massive bubble (10x-20x or 100k) until after the next halving. Last two major bubbles happened a year after the past halvings. 2013 (one year after 2012 halving) price went from 50 to 1000 (depending on where you pick the price before the bubble) and in 2017 (one year after 2016 halving) price went from 1000 to 20,000. 
So my estimate is for 2021 for the next bubble. Time to see how well people HODL.

It's a mirage. Go look for yourself. Go to the website. You "mine" coins by buying them. And you can't cash out. There are no exchanges so there's no trading. You can only buy on their site and then they populate your login screen with numbers. They say your onecoin is locked for x amount of time but you can never sell for fiat or any other crypto. There's no blockchain. You can't see the transactions. They just use buzz words to trick people into buying and then they increase the value of the coins by just saying so. There's also no vendors so you can't buy anything with them. It's all a huge scam.

Volatility will decrease as liquidity increases. Bitcoin, similar to a tech stock, is on an S curve. We are currently in exponential growth but it will level off and become more stable once it’s reached significant market penetration. Only then will it be a currency.

@_date: 2017-09-30 20:23:11

This experiment is going on right now. There are thousands of new coins with all the features you speak of. This is a free market. Anyone can choose whichever coin the want. Merchants can accept whichever one they want. Exchanges and businesses that deal in crypto can choose whichever they like.
Which has been chosen? Alts have been around for 4 years now. If you are right why hasn't there been a mass exodus? Why is Bitcoin still the most valuable?
Obviously people don't care about your definition of fair. They care about proven security and proven use cases. That's why only a few coins have any real value. 
Let me ask you a question. Do you own any crypto? Which ones do you own? By your argument, I would hope you own some obscure coin with a distribution to your liking and an inflation rate or something. But I doubt it. I bet you own the big names like Bitcoin and ethereum.

Ah but I think it's the strongest argument. If a Bitcoin is worth more than there is more money to be made mining Bitcoin and then there will be more miners which means more security. I think the amount of security naturally increases with the increased size of the network. 
When the subsidy is 3.1 but a Bitcoin is worth 3k did you really lose any security? And then assuming that the network has grown by 3x then you are bringing in a lot more in transactions fees. Again more security. 
I'm not worried about Bitcoin.

Government can stop it as effectively as removing drugs from America, or illegal online streaming, or illegal online market places. Government intervention has little power here.

I generally agree with you besides this statement. Many people in the 90s said e-commerce would never take off because people would never trust faceless unsecured websites with their personal details and bank information. Today people give away more than just bank information. They give away everything about themselves: location, birthdates, likes, dislikes, places they visit, family members, political views, literally every aspect of their life is given to websites who sell that information to the highest bidder. There was a massive societal shift in nearly ten years which changed the view of information. In the 90s it was unheard of to share much information to strangers on the internet. Today you’re weird if you don’t. I think a similar shift will happen to society about money.

I didn’t mean to sound condescending when I mentioned not knowing enough about Bitcoin. My apologies for that. It’s just a lot of times the people saying bubble only think of bitcoin as a currency trying to take over the dollar which is very far from what it is and what it’s doing.
Yes I do think bitcoin is overvalued. I think it was undervalued below 2k. But that’s just today. The ruler keeps moving as companies come on board and developers innovate on the protocol. So tomorrow (or realistically 6months from now) I’ll say under 3k is undervalued. 
I do think we are in mostly agreement. I only mentioned the US market to illustrate some people’s bias toward something they know and something that’s new. In this case they are both overvalued probably. But that only means there will be a correction in the short term and then continued growth.
Just because there is a bubble doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest. I’m still contributing to my retirement accounts even though I think the US market is in a bubble. That’s because I know when it corrects I’ll keep buying and over time I’ll end up even better than where I started. 
I just think when people say there is a bitcoin bubble they are meaning that bitcoin isn’t a good investment because it may decrease in value in the short term. What I’m saying is that doesn’t matter because long term the trend is still up after the correction.

Hmmm is loaning really money creation though? At least with a fixed supply currency?
A deposits 100btc into bank.
Bank loans out 90btc to B
B spends that money on a business.
B used profits from business to repay the bank who then repays A.
There's not really 190btc now. Just a liability from B to repay the bank with interest and the bank to repay A with interest.
There is still only 100btc in this scenario right? Or am I missing something? (Completely possible)
As long as the bank can't use debts to acquire more money is it creating btc? I think the answer is no.

Ethereum is very cool and will be a big part of this space. Bitcoin is much more secure and will be used more on the financial side of things. Ethereum will be a big part of smart contracts and probably be better as a medium of exchange. 
But either way I expect these two to merge in the future into one large network. Atomic swaps makes it easy to change between the two tokens depending on the need.
That’s the thing about protocols. They are ever evolving. Understanding the history of how the internet came to be is a great example of how I expect this protocol to go into the future. Including adoption timelines.

There are not infinite use cases for bitcoin. So in my opinion, when bitcoin reaches full market penetration in whichever markets it is disrupting it will stop growing. Or only grow as that market grows. 
So for example if bitcoin is a big player in the remittance market, it could take over the $585B market. Which would put bitcoin at around $34,000. At that point bitcoin would only grow as fast as the remittance market grows. 
Then you can use that logic and apply it to whatever market you think bitcoin might dip a toe into. Such as a store of value (disrupting the $7 Trillion gold market), or micro payments, or cloud storage, etc. 
Once it reaches full market penetration in the markets it will ultimate effect then it will only grow as fast as that market grows. Which is relatively stable.

Your welcome. It’s good that you admit your weaknesses on the subject and I hope you keep an open mind before passing permanent judgment. You may be glad you did...
If I have peaked your interest at all, I highly suggest you read the bitcoin white paper written by the inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. It’s only 9 pages and it’s an easy read. Next look up Andreas antanopolis and listen to his talks. He does a great job explaining the benefits and implications of Bitcoin. And answers many questions people have.
On to your statements:


No. The gold standard was removed completely in the 1970’s and was severed many years earlier. Paper money is only backed by the FAITH the people have in the US government. But even if we were talking about gold. What gives gold value? You’ve always just assumed it had value I bet. In actuality it’s just a metal found in the ground. It has minor use in electronics and jewelry but if that’s all people wanted it for it would only be worth about $10 dollars an ounce instead of 1200. The rest of the demand comes from people assuming it has value because they think other people may want it in the future. Speculators and holders give it value. And have done so for thousands of years. It’s stable because it has plateaued and slowly increases because it has a limited supply. 


This is true. There is no physical form except a public/private key that is a string of numbers and letters. And it does not have a centralized governing authority by design. A governing authority is made of people, usually only a handful of people, who make decisions for the entire population with no input from the people. This handful of people can make mistakes, or be corrupted by wealth, or simply be evil. Bitcoin takes them out of the picture and replaces them with an algorithm that everyone can see and plan around. There is no question what will happen in bitcoin which removes a ton of uncertainty. Every week the whole country hangs on the words of the FED chair to see which way our monetary policy will go. Like she is some kind of all knowing deity. That is not an ideal situation for an enlightened technologically advanced democratic society. We can do better and this is what that looks like.


Companies can come and go as they please. But understand that in a free market new companies will always enter a market where there is profit to be made. Sure companies could leave the US and it would drop our GDP. But why would they leave if they are making a profit? And if they do then another company will come along. There is money to be made in this space. And don’t forget companies don’t give bitcoin value. The people do. If people want to use it then companies will follow. 
This is like saying if companies leave the internet then the internet won’t be useful. Well, yes maybe less useful. But is anyone really worried that companies will leave the internet? If BOA left the internet it’s competitors would swoop in and take the people who want internet banking. So BOA would never leave.


This is just a misconception of bitcoin on your part. It would be silly to say the internet can’t work because of crashed hard drives. The same is true for bitcoin. Every single transaction and bitcoin are saved on thousands of computers at the same time all over the world. That’s what is meant by decentralized. You would have to destroy the internet for you to lose your bitcoin. It would be much easier to say, bomb a bank server and then all your money in your bank is gone. Because they store all the data in one place. They do that to build a firewall around it. Bitcoin works completely differently. It stores it all over the world and only gives you access if you have the private key. Instead of secured by a firewall (which has been hacked over and over) it is stored cryptographically and uses mathematics. In 8 years it has never been broken. There is no one place that can be targeted. If one node is corrupted. There is another 10,000 all across the globe which has stored your value. We have even backed up bitcoin on a satellite in space. 


There is no reason you can’t do both. I spend bitcoin usually in places where it gives me a discount. Then the second I spend it I rebuy my bitcoin using dollars. So I effectively got rid of my dollars but got a discount because I used btc. And my total btc count didn’t go down so if the next big boom in price happens I didn’t miss out.


I disagree. Bitcoin is too far ahead of its competitors. Anything developed in alt coins can be brought into bitcoin if it’s a big enough improvement. Also don’t get your head wrapped around using btc. It may be that in the future we still use a thing called dollars (to make it easier on people who don’t like change) but in the background our entire infrastructure runs on bitcoin. Much like how no one knows how the internet works. They don’t know what tcp/ip is or what it does. They just know how to get to Facebook. Bitcoin will be similar one day. No one will interact with bitcoin directly but they will use the layers on top that have been built to be user friendly graphics interfaces.


Neither you nor I can predict the future. But you already admitted your lack of knowledge on the subject. It may be worthwhile to look into the subject more deeply before making bold predictions. You may be surprised.


I bet one day it will be for everyone. They may just not know they’re using it.


You are again passing judgment and making predictions whiteout having all the information. Look into it more before writing it off. 
And don’t forget people already use digital currency. The majority of dollars are digital. Bitcoin is not that big of a step past the digital dollar.
I hope you look into it. Maybe buy one and store it away even if your not sure. Look back in ten years and see how you did. You don’t want to be one of those people who talk about how they could have bought Apple or amazon in the 90s. If bitcoin fails you lose whatever you put in (if you bought one btc you would lose $4000). But if it succeeds it could go extremely higher. The upside is 10x, 20x,? Who knows. Downside is 1x.

From what I read so far it has to be accepted at equal value. The examples they give are between a coin and an equal denomination debased coin. Like a silver dollar and a silver dollar made from steel. Both have the same denomination but one has a higher commodity value.

I am a big advocate for bitcoin and I also agree there will be a correction. It is very unlikely it will return to the price two years ago. Two years ago the price was $250. More likely it will return to 2000-3000. Then consolidate. Unless there is a fatal flaw in the protocol in which it will go to zero. The likelihood of a flaw is very small though since it’s been attacked 24/7 for 8 years without once being brought offline. No other network in the world aside from the internet itself can claim that. And there is nearly 100B dollar bounty to anyone who can crack it. And people have tried.
The S&amp;P is also at ATH. And has been on a 8-9 year bull run. It too is in a bubble. It will correct.

Yea that’s my point. Gold has held a value much greater than its actual manufacturing use because it’s a good store of value. It doesn’t corrode, it’s easily split up and malleable. It shows a store of value has a lot of demand. If bitcoin took just a fraction of gold (say 1 trillion) it would be around 50k per bitcoin. That doesn’t include any other market like remittances or blockchain storage.
Bitcoin will always have booms and busts but if you look at gold the daily price movements are minimal. Much better for a currency and it’s because of its higher liquidity. I don’t see bitcoin being used in any great volume for transactions until bitcoin is big enough that volatility is decreased to the level gold.

I was like you once. You are at the point where you think you know a lot but you haven’t realized how much you don’t know yet.
There is significant risk of failure still in bitcoin. Risk is significantly less than 5 years ago when I first bought but it’s still there. Demand is not guaranteed and people’s consumption choices is a very complex system. Adoption is not guaranteed.

It’s really no different than what we’re already doing. The only difference is the money is given to corporations in the form of subsidies.

And then when it levels off it will still be more ideal than fiat because at least it doesn't lose value.

So much flawed logic. How about instead of picking arbitrary numbers (30k, 50k, etc) you look at past btc bubbles? Corrections have been between 80-90% before. Especially after 100x increase. One thing that hasn’t happened is the correction falling as far as the previous all time high. In this case that’s 1200$. A 90% correction takes us to 2k and that still doesn’t violate the reaching of the previous ATH. 
Do I think this correction will reach 90%? No. My target bottom is between 3-4K and then consolidation in the 5-6k range for months before beginning the slow climb upward to begin the next bubble cycle.

Sure sounds great when you post your opinion like a fact.
But when we move back to reality, the technology adoption curve has a well known phenomenon called the chasm. It’s a point during adoption that is the Death Valley for that technology. And it occurs during the early adoption phase (which we are in with bitcoin). Generally this chasm happens before 10-20% of the population. So after that point (adoption greater than 20%) risk goes down that market saturation won’t occur but even then it still exists. Many many many technologies with great promise fail to reach mass market during this phase. 
So where are we with Bitcoin? Do you think adoption has surpassed 20% of the population or 1.5 billion people? Or in the US do you think 65 million Americans use it? Unlikely.
If you convince yourself there is zero risk, the only person you’re fooling is yourself.

It won’t be a currency until two things happen. The first is it will level off after significant market penetration. More liquidity will bring down volatility. The second is when second layer protocols are completed. Then you can do anything from micro to macro transactions with minimal fees. 
Until then it is speculation on the first decentralized secure trustless protocol. Every time a company builds a new service on the network it increases its utility. Every time its utility increases its demand increases. It’s also a store of value completely decoupled from the current financial system. A hedge against the rest of the market. That alone is worth a lot. I can see very soon every person who owns stocks or mutual funds also hold 10 percent in bitcoin in case of another recession. Similar to gold.
Of course today the majority of value comes from speculation that utility will come. And many times the price gets ahead of reality. But it’s a positive feedback loop. Each time the price rises. It brings in new developers and funds the current developers even more to continue innovation. More innovation pushes the price up. And repeat.

Historical bitcoin bubbles have retraced 80% after the massive bubble. That would put the bottom at around 2k after a 10k run up. Then it starts all over again. Next bubble would take it to 33k.
Not saying it happens this time but food for thought. Hodl either way and you’re fine. If anything we all get a chance for cheaper coins to accumulate more. My target is Q4 of 2018 to top 10k and begin the 1-2 year bear market to 2k. Levels off around 5k in 2019-2020. 33k around 2025.

Well if you ask the current president he wants to devalue the dollar so.... two birds right?
But really you don’t have to devalue the dollar to accomplish this. For example we spent 650B on fossil fuel subsidies in 2017. Not to mention renewable subsidies, agriculture subsidies, etc. you could easily cut out all the money we’re currently just handing out but instead giving it to regular people instead of companies. Turn the economy back over to the free market. Take that plus the money you save from cutting out welfare and you now have enough to fund a basic income without raising taxes or devaluing the dollar.
Problem is of course corporate welfare queens spend a lot to lobby politicians so that never seems to be on the table.

Haha I don’t care where bitcoin goes. It’s already made me more money than I need. But I do have a very good grasp of network effects, technology, and economics. And I have had this conversation many times on this subreddit over the years. I’ve won every bet about whether the price will be higher or lower in X years. (Spoiler alert: my side of the bet was always that it would be higher). It’s interesting the doubters still come out nearly ten years into the project. Funnily enough when I come back to gloat, the accounts who adamantly yelled there was no intrinsic value so the price must go to zero are always gone...
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:05:11


Sure. Like any commodity, the market drives the price. It is limited supply and increasing demand will drive the price up. Lower demand decreases the price. 


Yes. Just like anything including fiat. If demand decreases the price decreases. Bitcoin has an advantage though. Fiat (like the dollar) has two mechanisms of decreasing value. The first is increasing supply and the second is decreasing demand. Banks and the FED could increase supply (quantitative easing) and flood the market with dollars. This is happening all the time and is the reason the dollar has lost 95% of its value. People could also decide to use a different currency like euros or whatever. Either way will drop the value of the dollar. Bitcoin will only lose value due to decreasing demand because it has a fixed supply. The thing is with bitcoin though, is it’s constantly increasing its utility. New businesses open with new ideas how to use it. It’s programmable money that can be used for all kinds of new things which push it into new and innovative. This drives new demand every day. 


The only way it becomes less useful and not more useful is if a fatal flaw is found in the protocol. That is really the only reason it would crash to zero. Otherwise it will go up and down due to speculators but the overall trend will remain up until it has reached full market penetration. Meaning it has saturated whatever market it hopes to enter. Such as remittances, internet of things, micro transactions, or whatever else companies think of to use it for. At that point it levels off and has much lower volatility.
Btw a fatal flaw at this point is very unlikely. It has run nonstop for 8 years as an open source software. It is attacked 24/7 for 8 years and has a 70 billion dollar bounty to anyone that can crack it. No other system in the world has run nonstop without being hacked. Not banks, the swift network, the US government. No one.


What flaws?


Crypto currencies are made every day. Non have come close because it has multiple network effects that make this very unlikely.


What is “inherent value”? Fiat has no inherent value. Gold? Bitcoin has value in its utility. And people speculate on its future utility. That’s what gives it value. Anything has value because we give it value. The dollar is valuable even though it’s just paper because it’s useful to transact with. If something comes out that is more useful, then the dollar will lose value in favor of that new thing.


This is true today. But not true for all of eternity. All high growth assets follow an s curve and eventually plateau. Bitcoin is no different. Early adopters will hold until it levels off and reaches market penetration. Then volatility will decrease and it will be more useful in transactions. 


No. Spending does not drive the price down. Only selling for another currency would do that. If a merchant accepts bitcoin. And then uses bitcoin to buy other goods and services then it does not drive the price down. Not until someone decides to exchange their Bitcoin for dollars. If bitcoin continues to grow and more and more people accept it then there’s no reason to ever sell. You just use it to buy whatever you want.

No bitcoin isn’t twice as hard to mine at the halving. Don’t listen to this guy.
The halving cuts the mining subsidy in half. So new bitcoin coming into the market each ten min is reduced. The growth rate of the supply is reduced. Has nothing to do with difficulty.

It’s intended to be a protocol of trust. It’s first ‘app’ is currency (or so the inventor thought). But that doesn’t mean that’s what it will be in the future. And when/if it does become more useful as a currency, there will probably be many currencies. Some inflationary, some deflationary, some of any flavor you can think of. With atomic swaps it will be seamless to move about different currencies based on the need. That’s what I’m trying to say, this technology is the future of trust, but what it will look like when it becomes a reserve currency is very tough to predict. So applying problems to the way bitcoin currently looks isn’t productive.

Ah I see. You’re a teamster who just roots for red. You don’t really want a free market you just want to give money to people you deem appropriate. No better than the left giving money to welfare. You decided to just put down people who think government should not be in the business of handing out money (if they have to it should be to the people and not picking winners and losers) instead of providing any real argument for such subsidies. Sorry sir but it is you who has no clue. (And don’t give me crap about competing in a global market bullshit, farmers should compete like everyone else if you truly believed in a free market).
Luckily bitcoin takes care of this. If it ever does fulfill reserve status it would be too expensive for governments to hand out money like it does today whether it’s subsidies or welfare. This only happens when you are able to control the money supply.

Sure if the majority are debtors I could see that. But we are very far from anyone in bitcoin being debtors and holders would never vote for that.

Not OP but... It's all speculation that Bitcoin will continue to be more and more useful in the future. If the speculators lose faith that Bitcoin will be useful in the future (as a currency, as a protocol, whatever use) and they leave, then Bitcoin will lose value. As it loses value people who held it as a store of value begin to not trust it as a store of value and also leave. So people who demand a store of value are secondary to speculators who expect it to be useful in the future.
So I guess what I'm getting at is, it became worth something from pennies as people began to see a future use for Bitcoin knowing that it doesn't have a current  use today. The moment Bitcoin becomes useless (companies stop building on the protocol, no one accepts it as a medium, etc) or even if people perceive that it will be useless in the future then it will lose nearly all value including as a store of value.

You missed his point. The difference is when you put cash under your mattress you took the money out of circulation which reduces money supply. If everyone did that then it would have an effect. In this case money supply goes down and demand goes down.
When you buy gold you give the merchant your dollars which then remains in circulation. In this example supply remains the same and demand goes down. 
See the effect on the value of the dollar is different in these two scenarios.

My thoughts about using a credit card is this. I'm not worried about them taking my personal info because honestly my info is everywhere anyway. I've had cards for years and been hacked numerous times (target, Home Depot, OPM, etc) so my info is already out there. I use interest free credit cards to buy Bitcoin because over the 21 months the value of the loan goes down from inflation and I expect the value of Bitcoin to increase (over the long term... Decades). Then at the end of the 21 months I pay off the credit card balance with fiat and start the process over again. (Yes I could just take my fiat savings and move it to Bitcoin but I like having cash on hand and if I can have an interest free loan why not use that?)

I completely agree! I think the point I was trying to make was in looking for the cheapest energy and consistent pricing, one will be driven toward solar as solar costs come down.
I also agree currently miners are taking advantage of excess energy from power plants and until they build their own then bitcoin is not affecting global emissions anymore than if they didn’t exist. I would argue before any miner would think of building a power plant it would be much more effective to build a solar farm.

That was exactly my thoughts. I have 3 other friends that sold some in December of last year. 
One didn’t claim anything. Got his return days later. (And he traded more than 25k multiple times in 2017 so we’ll see if he gets in trouble a few years down the road).
The second claimed the sale of one btc and got his return shortly after. No audit.
The third went the super legit route. Paid for that bitcoin tax website. Provided every trade, every buy, every conversion to alts, every coin split. He filed late and hasn’t heard back yet. Neither with a return or an audit. He spent days working on it and hunting down every transaction he ever made. Even sending btc to me to pay for lunch or beer.
And then I fell in the middle. I sold one btc last year and I bought it in 2015. So I claimed the one btc. And paid 15% on it. I didn’t claim every trade and every split. But I got audited.

The revenue they still bring in. I’m playing the smallest violin for less profits. 
There is a happy medium here. Never before have we had a deflationary programmable currency. You can bake in every nuance you want including inflationary top layers and deflationary settlement layer. 
We’re in a new world. There is much more divisibility with bitcoin than with gold. It’s proven people still buy in deflationary markets. I don’t see a problem here.
And even if I did it doesn’t matter. The cat is out of the bag and people will want money that doesn’t lose value. Regardless if you think fiat is better for the world economy (I don’t), people will trade money that loses value for money that doesn’t. For the first time government will have to compete with global, deflationary, censorship resistant currencies.
@_date: 2015-11-02 14:46:01
So based on your answer i guess you just don't know how to solve the problems I brought up. The incentive of Bitcoin is to hold because it appreciates in value. Where is the incentive to spend or invest in small businesses? Who will invest in the local guy who wants to own a bakery? Wall Street traders? I don't think so. If this problem isn't solved I can only see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation like gold is. (Which is still a huge market but doesn't replace the current economy).
As much as you hate banks (and believe me I do too), it is naive to say that this isn't a problem that will hurt innovation and business creation.

If it is literally illegal, then I think the committed people developing Bitcoin will move to a different location. Some people will move and others won't. Some will stay in the west and just secretly work on it. But Bitcoin won't die. The infrastructure is there and companies can move their headquarters to better locations. Just like how pirate bay jumps around. In the meantime emerging markets will be growing the network.
It will be a huge setback and the west will be behind the rest of the world before they shift their outlook on digital currencies. But Bitcoin won't die.

This argument is invalid. We just had the most transactions ever in the mempool. You sound hilariously like Yogi Berra's quote "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.". Obviously lots of people use it otherwise it wouldn't be crowded. Your last statement of "and I don't see it getting any easier" is also just short sightedness on your part. Bitcoin has gotten infinitely easier since the beginning and continues to get easier every day. Building infrastructure from the ground up takes time. Just because it's not easy today doesn't mean it will always be like that. It's not a static system.


The actual real world value is exactly 1600 or whatever the price is currently. It includes the real world value of transactions plus the speculators who see the trends of ever increasing volume and improvements and extrapolate where the value could be in the future. Maybe you're the sucker for not seeing the trends.

@_date: 2015-11-20 13:34:14
Honestly I think if the west over regulates or even bans holding Bitcoin or any software associated to Bitcoin it won't slow the adoption much. The real adoption should come from emerging markets in South America, Africa, Middle East, and Asia. As adoption grows in those locations the price goes up and all those companies in the west who invested billions in infrastructure will lobby the government to reduce regulations. The price is key to the west adopting Bitcoin. The price is meaningless in emerging markets, they only care about getting access to banking and transfers. All of us just need to hold out, keep your Bitcoin offline and wait till it is accepted everywhere. Remember the first market for Bitcoin is the 5 billion under-banked or bank-less people.

I'm completely with you on banks. No one argues that they are stealing our money, but to dismiss the current efficient way of breeding innovation and ideas and small businesses which power all economies is naive and should be talked about. If someone right now wants to start a business, he takes on personal financial risk by taking out a loan and opens up shop. A person should take on risk to start a business but he should also have funding readily available.  How will that work without banks or loans? 
Crowdfunding was your immediate answer but my problem is that crowds sometimes don't see the potential in an idea or business and tons of ideas never get funded on crowdfunding sites. Will we have less innovation and less variety in business? 
I think the only way it could work is to take your Bitcoin (which appreciates at x% a year) and place it in a bank which gives you an interest of y% per year. The bank then loans it to people for business or whatever and charges z% per year. Where x&lt;y&lt;z. Each step has to have a financial incentive. You are incentivized to put your Bitcoin in a bank to get a higher return, banks are incentivized to loan to make a profit, and people don't have to rely on crowds seeing their vision to start a business. But then you are still using banks which most people on this sub are trying to avoid.

Yes but if another platform based on the Bitcoin protocol arises with better features then you may see the same migration happen.

But if another platform starts to gain ground and has better features (cheaper, easier, faster) then the migration away from Bitcoin will happen.

At some point in the future there will be companies on the Bitcoin protocol which undercut amer ex (or maybe amer ex will itself move onto the blockchain) but right now it does not compete with cc companies as a payment rail. It does compete with remittance companies, it provides a hedge for savers and investors, it provides a protocol for companies to innovate decentralized value apps, it allows for future micropayment marketplaces to develop, and many more things people haven't thought of yet. We are still in the infrastructure building phase.
So keep your amer ex for the points and whatever (I do), and do your research before maybe socking a few Bitcoin away for future use.

It's cut with Fentanyl because a black market dude is making it. If you want to get rid of black markets then legalize and regulate it. It's only unsafe because we have pushed it underground. If it were legal then the producers would be tested and audited. Dangerous chemicals wouldn't be in the drug.
And what's the alternative? Go after it with the FBI when it's in Russia or something? What happened after Silk Road shut down? 10 more popped up in its place. It's short sighted to fight it. Educate and regulate is the only way that works. Also funding recovery centers and put people in there instead of prison.

You need to get your friend on here so he can provide more details. I'm not sure why your asking for him. You haven't given anyone anything to go on. Does the have the hard drive where the file was stored? Does he not know how to import it? Did he throw the hard drive away? Is it broken? What's the public address? 
If your friend really mined coins at $.02 then he would have been one of the first 100 people to do so. I find it hard to believe he knew how to do that but doesn't know how to recover them. More likely he is lying to you. Or his hard drive is in the bottom of a landfill and he never thought to back it up.

What you hate are the conglomerate mega banks that have (in recent years) gobbled up everything and destroyed the economy. Bitcoin will bring banking back to earth. It keeps a lid on fractional reserve banking.  Invest in the local economy and pay interest (real interest not this .00001 bullshit).

Also quantum computing doesn't even hurt Bitcoin that much. All it does is allow someone to possibly brute force the private keys from a public key. Most people are safe from this though. Because if you keep your btc in an address that has never been sent from then you never published your public address. So your safe. And also most wallets now a days creates a new address for each transaction. So you never reuse addresses. So your also safe.
The only people at risk are people who have a lot of btc in an address that you spent from (which is bad practice). Or people who print out a public address and reuse it over and over and leave a lot of btc in there.

If it becomes a widely used currency then you never have to sell it. Do you have to sell your dollars before using them? 
There are so many possibilities with Bitcoin, maybe you never use it like dollars in everyday use but it is used in the background as a rail in nearly all worldwide transactions. It could be the system in which our financial system works without anyone even realizing. Beautifully behind the scenes. Maybe it's used for machine to machine payments, or cloud record keeping where records live on the blockchain forever. Maybe it's used as a store of value against uncertain political times, or in countries where their government is inflating away the national currency. 
Unfortunately it seems you have made up your mind without much research. Hopefully a few years from now you don't say to your colleagues, "I should have bought Bitcoin when I heard about it in 20XX". Just like how my current coworkers constantly bellyache about not buying Apple and Amazon.

I have been in Bitcoin since 2005. So my opinion is even more valid than yours. I was extremely bearish but have flipped to bullish on Bitcoin recently. The bcc coin will flop.

Looks like the big difference is Blockstream doesn’t own 80% of bitcoin. Ripple owns something like 80% of xrp. 
There’s no chance of blockstream crashing the value of your coin. There is a high risk ripple crashes the value of xrp.
I misspoke about the security. You are correct that liquid is not using bitcoins security. 
But using a token that is independent is worth it in my opinion. Either way I won’t be using liquid or ripple.

You can put the public addresses into the blockchain site and just watch those accounts. So he could have put the public addresses in there which add up to thousands of bitcoins to dupe you into thinking he had thousands of coins. Not saying he did that but he could have with that wallet.
(For example, everyone knows the public address of satoshis coins, I could put those addresses into the blockchain wallet and "watch" it. I wouldn't have control of the funds but the wallet would add up all the coins and present them to me in the wallet)
The only way to know if someone has the funds for sure is to have them sign a message from an account with thousands of coins in them, or for him to tell you the public address where he keeps thousands of bitcoins and then move those coins on command to a new address proving he is in control of the funds.
Same kind of issue occurred with that Australian bloke. He claimed to be satoshi but when the community told him to prove it by moving the coins proven to be associated with the real satoshi he balked and had this huge public meltdown. Proving he was just a scam artist.

First off transgender is a term for someone who identifies as a different gender than what they were born with. It’s not a term for people who have had surgery. 
Secondly, from the quick searches I did, there are 1 million (estimated) transgender adults in the US. That’s like .3% of the population. And then I would estimate that kids who fall into this category are even less. It’s not an epidemic. 
So of this small number of kids who identify as a different gender, there is an even smaller number of parents who would allow surgery, and even smaller number of doctors who would do this type of surgery on a child. So I really have a hard time seeing the downfall of society here. Except in your crazy mind.
Also telling parents how to parent. I thought you were a libertarian (based on your love for the_donald and infowars). You would rather legislate freedom of parents and teenagers then have like a 100 trans kids? Tell me again who loves big government lol.

I’m like you. But what I did was set seemingly unlikely targets early and only sell if it hits those targets. For example my first target was, I wanted to be able to sell one btc and recoup my entire initial investment. That way at any point after that I was only holding profit and zero risk. My next target is I won’t sell again until I can sell one btc and pay off my house. Not sure what my next target after that will be.

Who cares about a 25% pull back (excessive for illustrative purposes) from 6k to 4.5k when in two years the price might be 100k. It literally wouldn’t matter much whether you bought at 4.5 or 6 when the price is 100.
More likely what happens is you miss the pull back and ends up going higher and you should have just bought at 6.
No one who bought in 2015 says man I’m glad for the retrace from 600 to 450. Either way if you had bought at 450 or 6, you’re sitting pretty at current prices.

Governments don't promise the value of that money though. Which is why it loses half its value every 30 years. If you had a choice to put your savings into a currency that increases in value or decreases in value which would you choose?
Also what does the assets have to do with anything if people lose faith in the currency? There are numerous times in the past where the value of a national currency went to zero even though the country had assets.
Inflation is happening everywhere and at some point that inflation causes people to lose faith in the currency. Take out the central control and you can have much more confidence in a currency. Politics change with the wind. Math is forever.

Ok so let's follow your logic thru. The US and all its ally's agree that Bitcoin is bad and make it illegal. Innovation leaves and moves overseas to countries who don't follow the US lead. People in the US still buy crypto products because it's still a better store of value and still has the properties which make it interesting today (regardless what the government says). People in the US and elsewhere are spending their fiat to the countries who didn't ban Bitcoin so those countries are even more incentivized to keep it legal regardless of sanctions cause they are still making money. Consumers in US bought products from the other countries that allow them to use Bitcoin anywhere in the US without the business knowing (xapo equivalent). 
Bitcoin still wins. US loses out on the next wave of internet innovation.

(It's posts like this that make me think rbtc claims of censorship is complete bullshit or at least vastly overstated)

Man your trying really hard to talk your self out of the blockchain. Bitcoin is many magnitudes more valuable than Facebook, or email, or the internet as a whole. It's freedom and democratic monies. It combines a massive network effect, with an immutable ledger, global, borderless, trustless, currency, with a value that will never inflate away no matter who is in office, or what country you live in. It's also a platform/protocol to build the next generation of internet companies on that can trade value globally and instantly. 
Facebook is nothing. Literally worthless in my eyes. One day, this will click for you, and you'll wish you had seen it earlier. 
I took me three months of research before it clicked and during that time I kicked myself for letting the price go from 200 to 250.

Lol it works till it doesn’t. 


You should care if it’s pre-mined or centralized (I’m not a libertarian). Because I know you care about the price. Simple supply and demand. Supply is controlled by a monopoly. Means he can control the price as he sees fit (at least in the downward direction). He could flood the market and drive the price down at any moment. Or they could get hacked. Either way terrible terrible terrible idea to have any real money in something with such a glaring security hole.  Not to mention ripple can just make more xrp at any moment (another downside to centralization) inflating the price away. 
Name one company or government that hasn’t been hacked? It’s because it’s centralized. It’s an easy target. Big ole honey pot.
If you choose to ignore this that’s your choice. But you should at least beware of the risks. You can still obviously make money in the space. It’s manipulated by ripple so you can ride it up and down all you like taking profit along the way. But if your just hodling thinking it’s going to be the next big thing, I have bad news for you.

Just curious, did you sell all your bitcoin for Bcash like a lot of people on that other sub? 
We tried to warn you guys ... no one likes to see someone lose all their money.

It’s google trends. Is it possible in your conspiracy fake news world that different news outlets chose different parameters when searching through google trends? And it’s not a conspiracy to spew fake news? Such as Bloomberg searching on 2018 trends in America, while wapo searched on the globe? (Just an example, not saying those are the specific differences)
Perhaps it’s not fake news. Perhaps you just didn’t look into their articles far enough to see the differences in what they were writing about.

He simultaneously helped me understand how Bitcoin worked and the implications of Bitcoin without sounding like a loon which is not an easy thing to do. Every time I try to explain it to someone who's interested I end up confusing my own words and looking like a futurist nutjob. Kudos to Andreas!

You don't have to use an exchange. If you don't use an exchange how will they tax you?

Unless you are a competent programmer, you still have to trust what developers tell you. You have to trust that bitcoin works the way they say and the protocol is as robust as were told.
Now of course it’s been around ten years without a hack and lots of different developers have reviewed the code and presented their findings but there is still trust.
Not really disagreeing with you because I am after all a bitcoiner and trusting developers is better than trusting bankers but there’s still trust.

Lol you’ve been swindled. Nothing about xrp is decentralized. 
I really hope the dude that controls the sell button on 80% of the coins doesn’t bump it and you end up with worthless digital crap. Also seems really easy to hack since it’s permissioned. Every centralized database gets hacked eventually. 
I’ll stick with bitcoin. No crazy founders in the picture. No centralization. No premine. Etc.

It costs much more than that to use a credit card. And is much faster than centralized settlements. 
For example when you sell a stock and take the cash out the settlement time is a business week. People here are upset if it takes longer than ten minutes.
The Bitcoin network seems to be moving toward a settlement layer, where other networks will be built on higher layers with instantaneous and nearly infinite volumes. Then those layers will settle periodically on the Bitcoin core layer. You still use the same coins but now is much more versatile. And still has the same security we have come to enjoy.

That's true. You sound like a teenager who already knows everything so it would be pointless to read anything else ever. Better to place your valuable time elsewhere. Maybe you'll go back to learning new things after a few more years of maturity.

Crypto is censorship resistant. No one said you have to use the private business coinbase.

Well he said the market cap of crypto = 1 trillion. Not Bitcoin.
So first you have to assume btc = x% of the crypto market. Maybe 40%?
Then divide by the number of coins in circulation.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:48:19
So now your saying what if the entire internet goes down? 
Ok you win, if an asteroid hits and everyone dies, yes Bitcoin would have been a bad investment. This is how your outlandish questions come off.
You don't seem to be trying to learn but only argue. Just don't buy it. If you don't think it can increase in value just ignore it. I think it will so I bought In. So far I have been right but maybe that won't be the case forever. Only time will tell who was right.

You just send btc to your online wallet like any btc transaction.

Pull backs will happen. Waiting for them is silly though. Gotta use longer time preferences and then these small pull backs don’t matter

Technology has a way of getting thru regulations.
See p2p programs that shared music. It was very illegal to pirate music and what happened? People did it anyway because it was nearly impossible to stop someone trading without a intermediary.
There are already ways to pay for things in business using Bitcoin with the business not knowing that you are paying with Bitcoin. See Bitcoin debit cards. Load it up with Bitcoin, then go into your favorite store and purchase whatever. You slide a plastic card like everyone else and used Bitcoin. Tell me again how they would stop you?

I wonder what this guy thinks of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:06:20
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:47:30
Well with the debit card you can use Bitcoin anywhere visa is accepted. So you don't need the internet.
My point is there is literally nothing the government can do if you choose to opt out of National Fiat money for any reason and use Bitcoin. If you live under tyrannical rule (like you suggested) you could still use Bitcoin in secret.
I understand the point you are getting at. Some people (maybe more than half) will just do whatever the government says. They won't do something just because it's illegal. "If its illegal its bad". But you only have to look at marijuana to see that the other half will do what they want regardless of the laws or fines or cost. This is the first time in history there was even an option to choose to opt out of the current National Money system and I bet a lot of people will take it.

Tell that to the billions of dollars invested in the thousands of companies building on the Bitcoin network. They seem to be able to leverage the users.

And where do you think value comes from? 
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:11:41
Theoretically yes but bitcoin is on the cutting edge of computer programming and cryptography. I don’t expect myself becoming an expert in programming, or cryptography mathematics, or economics. How bout you?
