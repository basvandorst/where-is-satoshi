Thank you. We have yet a long way to go before we bottom then.

Nice way to avoid the question. Microsoft is not the 1st OS. It came way even later than even Apple OS.

Rally from 6600 to below 6400 now you mean lol?

Are you sure buying at 6k is actually low. I think we are yet to see low, not till it hits 3000.

Hypothetically if it is not a small amount, can we get Coinbase or similar exchanges to give it to the willful owner after someone dies. 
Crypto might need such law or maybe we need a smart contract to enable it so the descendents dont miss out cos they lost the private key or couldn't find it.

We need a site for recording **China Bans Bitcoin** like the one with Bitcoin Will Die site.

Are you sure Bitcoin will still be the top currency with 10 mins of confirmation time and won't turn into MySpace?
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:39:37
What a load of bullshit.

The way it is going, soon bitcoin will fall 20% when Palau bans it. This is ridiculous considering so many great news came up in the last month.

If for Bitcoin, definitely get Trezor. Slightly more expensive than Ledger but very reliable and open source so no backdoor or risk. I keep my Bitcoin in Trezor and the other altcoins in Ledger.

Just curious why did you use such a low sat/b value knowing it may get confirmed never or may take long long time.

I hope it happens for the sake of almost all of us.

Or maybe not. BTC futures killed the market. ETF could be used to control more also.
P.S. Before you guys jump to bash me, I am 65&amp; down since I started in crypto in Sept. So, yes I want the market to be up than anyone else, but I am not so sure ETF will necessarily bring bull run. If SEC is going to approve it, it won't tolerate extreme market swing or manipulation and hence - no moon lambo.
