that's presumptuous of you to say the demand and price in china will go up.  bitcoin is not a USD in utility, acceptance and stability.  argentinians who have acquired USD know they can spend that almost anywhere in the world.  the same can not be said for bitcoin.

This foreshadows a parallel to Online Poker in America.  Google 'UIGEA' and 'poker black friday'.  
In poker they cut off all the banks/payment processors servicing offshore operators.  After years of legislation, online poker in america has come back to 3 states: nevada, new jersey and delaware.
There will be a long very long process to determine which operators will be allowed to operate domestically in America.
I guess this is the wallstreet movement we were all waiting for.

*(in between april 12 to april 20, i replied to a customer satisfaction survey where i replied i was not satisfied due to a unresolved refund.)*
Why can't I see my transaction history regarding support request tickets?
You claim that i entered your site's deposit address as my refund address.  I have nothing to go on but your word.  Also in my "personal info" section, I put my actual bitcoin refund address when i registered.
Would it not be standard operating procedure to refund any escrowed funds to the bitcoin address that I registered to your site?
Only after this reddit post went up did I receive a refund in the full amount escrowed. (plus an additional 0.01btc.)  I hope this is just a case of poor communication and not a scam operation.

This will get stricter enforcement of such funds account Bitcoin transactions had to move abroad to become other than disk -based semi-underground market
 
It is reported that the central bank branches to the central bank issued a report entitled "further strengthen risk prevention bitcoins work notice " (the "Notice" ) in mid- March , the document requires banks and third-party payment agencies, Close all trading accounts within the territory of more than a dozen Bitcoin platform. This means that financial institutions trading account opening Bitcoin website platform is not legitimate unless cash transactions, investors not to bitcoin bank transfer transactions in China , third-party payment , unprecedented intensity .
 
"Notice" requirement that all commercial banks and third-party payment agencies to close all accounts of these platforms , the deadline is April 15 . Before this deadline , these accounts can still withdraw cash , but can not recharge. Overdue closed , the central bank will be punished. In addition , the central bank also asked the Association to continue to track the payment and settlement platform recharge means change , and timely notification to commercial banks.

I believe very long and strict regulations will be coming in the future.  
before that, there will be regulatory hearings.  I suggest the Gox victims to go testify your experience of losing bitcoins and fiat.  Publicize to the media, friends and family your loss of bitcoins.  The world deserves to hear your side of the story.  There are plenty of stories of people getting rich off of bitcoin.  This is the time to publicize and share the tragedies that happened.  Warn them that what happened to you can easily happen to them due to the lack of regulations.  Do not be embarassed by your losses either.  It wasn't really your fault.  This easily could have happened to the other exchanges.  
Mt. Gox was once the largest exchange for at least 6 months out of 2013 and only recently dropped to 
It was on the bitcoin foundation as a gold member.  That signified to a lot of people that Mtgox was vetted by the bitcoin foundation as a reputable exchange.  Why wasn't Mt. Gox removed from the foundation earlier?  it was removed only after their had been fiat/bitcoin withdrawal issues.
I squarely place a lot of the blame on the bitcoin foundation for not warning the bitcoin community of these problems.  ignorance is not an excuse either.  There needs to be checks/balances in this world.  It's negligence on the Bitcoin Foundation's part to not do due diligence on its members businesses.
I personally would much rather have full on SEC regulations for bitcoin in the future.  It's clear that the Bitcoin Foundation does not have the ability to warn the community of such a disastrous event.  The bitcoin community is not capable of self regulation.  
At the end of the day, it was gox's users fault for choosing to do business with Mt. Gox.  They take that risk by transferring control of our btc to a 3rd party exchange.  Whether it's bitstamp, btce, btcchina or mtgox, we don't really know what is going on behind the scenes.  However, it has to be restated, Mt. Gox was a Bitcoin Foundation member.  A foundation that is seen as the public face of bitcoin.  It is logical for many new adopters that the safest place to trade would be with an exchange that has a CEO on the Bitcoin Foundation board.

 I can confirm OKCoin removed a number of accounts (used by OKCoin bots) to pass the Proof-of-Reserve audit in Aug 2014. In essence, these bots trade on fractional (or fictional) reserves. Stephan Thomas was lied to during the audit. This is an unfortunate limitation of the proof-of-reserves method.
okcoin could still be solvent.  They removed their version of willy bot to pass the audit.

@_date: 2015-07-13 14:18:59
these ddos problems are only going to get worse and worse.  this is the second time in 3 days.
how is anyone able to trade when they're down for 2 hours while the price moves 20%?
i had a limit bid that got executed/ margin called during the downtime.  
are we supposed to expect a ddos attack and a 3 hour downtime during each major price move?
futures is a 0 sum game.  someone is profiting with the ddos.  that incentive needs to to be removed.
each time okc gets ddos attacked, rollback all trades and close out all open positions (longs/shorts) immediately prior to the ddos.  i could care less about the "rebate" for the losses during the downtime.  you have to eliminate the opportunity of the attackers to profit from this ddos attack.
assuming the ddos attackers had massive short positions open prior to the drop.  if you roll it back and close out all open positions irregardless whether long or short.  then the okc user base as a whole wud socialize the "loss" in % of the price drop without any leveraged positions.  so the attackers who were short would share in that socialized loss not in bitcoin but just the nominal fiat value of each coin.
that is the only way.  
does okc use amazon cloud service ddos protection?  nothing?
ill probably be waiting to see the okc official response to this bullshit.  i will most likely be leaving okc soon.  it is only a matter of time before this shit happens again.

if vendors can not price their goods in bitcoin, then how would anyone know that they indirectly accept bitcoin via bitpay?

They can also execute you.  I made a reddit post quoting the views of a Chinese citizen/user of bitcoin at the start of the bubble and his predictions of government action.  The chinese government executed people involved in "shadow banking".

I'd take the word of the CEO of BTC China over some unknown "joseph wang".  the CEO of the largest btc exchange in the world has absolutely no reason to spread bad news.  These statements were made at a bitcoin conference that actually took place.  
this is "joseph wang"'s bio: 
it does not say where he's worked at previously nor his current employer.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:48:34
how is it misleading?  it's a legitimate question as to the next course of action by Chinese officials.  Clearly the GBL exchange was a Ponzi or fraud scheme.  They ran away with depositors money.
Previous perpetrators of fraud in the multi million dollar range have been executed in China.  Will it happen to the GBL operators?  if it does, how will it affect the future of bitcoin in China?
This is not FUD.  It's open ended questioning that i hope will lead to a deeper analysis.

if you think what Bobby Lee said is "good news", then there's nothing i can quote or say that will convince you otherwise.
just remember immediately after China's official statement, the next day china telecom/baidu and many other services shut down their btc payment options.  imo that makes China's position on bitcoin very clear.

i totally expect this to put a freeze on any VC investment on bitcoin in china.  they've basically reduced btc in china to the status of WOW gold.

Bobby Lee was not proven wrong by real local Chinese.  The man is the CEO of BTC China.  He would not spread untrue negative information when it would harm his business.  
and who exactly is paying for merchant goods/services with bitcoins when it's illegal to have bitcoin payment processors like Bitpay?  don't answer, it's a rhetorical question.
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:45:11


dude, it's not what I think.  It's what Bobby Lee explicitly said.  i provided a link to his speech.  Bobby Lee has every incentive to promote the use of bitcoin as a medium of exchange for goods/services.  the fact that he said it is against Chinese law means that it is against the law.  
this isn't a difference of opinion.  It is a fact that the Chinese government bans the use of bitcoin in exchange for services/goods.
Stop being delusional.

having a btc merchant processing service is a huge part of any healthy btc economy.  Bobby Lee was asked THREE times if btc could be exchanged for goods/services.  If they allowed btc merchant processors, don't you think Bobby Lee would have mentioned it?  
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:49:53
great rebuttal
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:33:37
Goods/services are not allowed to be exchanged for bitcoin.  Vendors also can not price goods/services in bitcoin.  China's turned btc into a tulip.

there's a huge uncertainty on how the govt will deal with bitcoin threatening the power of their regime.  
how they deal with the perpetrators of the GBL exchange scam will indicate bitcoin's future in china.

Bobby Lee (CEO of BTC China) said goods/services can not be paid for in bitcoin.  they can not even be priced in bitcoin.
bobby lee has no incentive to spread negativity about bitcoin in china.  the fact that he said what he said means that it is really just that bad.  
get over it.  start promoting bitcoin in another country that is more conducive.  China's bubble will pop.  it's only a matter of time.  i would focus on promoting bitcoin in europe and south america.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:29:13
Bobby Lee did explicitly say that Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau are completely separate jurisdictions.

China's bad news might still be coming.  they caught the 3 operators of the GBL exchange scam.  if those guys are executed, i don't expect bitcoin to be worth a penny in china.

People learn to read between the lines.  China is NOT bitcoin friendly.
Even if these payment processors or bank wires were still working.  Goods/services can not be purchased or priced with bitcoin.  the fact that bitcoin commerce is banned means that bitcoin's sole use to the Chinese is for speculation and novelty.
why would the chinese buy bitcoin if they can not legally spend it?  are they buying it with the hope that they can sell it for more?  
i expect a mass exodus of bitcoin from china along with huge downward bear market pressure for at least the next 1 or 2 months if not longer.
@_date: 2013-12-15 11:00:25
everyone needs to get over China.  the china bubble rise started on a a baidu rumor.  the chinese government will not let btc develop into a robust part of the economy.
it's time to focus on more bitcoin friendly parts of the world.  south america, africa should be the focus.

this confirms what i've said that China was a bubble created purely on speculation.  i don't believe it will have a robust btc economy where btc will be widely exchanged for services/goods.

Joseph Wang is an unknown investment banker  in Hong Kong.  nobody knows who he is or where he works.
Bobby Lee is the CEO of BTC China who made a speech in Las Vegas at a bitcoin conference stating that "goods/services can not be purchased using bitcoin in China".  
Gee...  i wonder who to believe...  an unverified "hong kong investment banker" or the CEO of BTC China (largest global btc exchange)?
how delusional do you get?
