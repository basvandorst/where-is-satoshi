Alright then Stephen Hawking, it's just my opinion man.  I'm not trying to crack the case and prove anything.  They asked a question and I was just trying to answer them.  If Bitcoin's price becomes prohibitive in terms of trading people will still use it, they will just be using smaller denominations of it.
Instead of attacking me for thinking my response isn't very well thought out you could respond to them directly, and give a better opinion. Telling someone their comment "means nothing" or that they made a "moronic statement" is closer to being of a 14 year old's mindset than it is to have an incorrect analysis of something.  I hope you have a good day, and get out of whatever funk causes you to be rude to people.

If you google search "How many millionaires are there" the first thing says around 36 million of them. That's probably where the 40 million number comes from.
Being a millionaire rarely means that you have $1,000,000 in the bank.  If you own a $500,000 house paid off, $200,000 in your 401K, and $300,000 in other assets, properties, or cash, then you're a millionaire. They just add up your net worth.  Not what you have in cash. 
You asked if BTC's scarcity would discourage mass adoption, but in my opinion the fact that Bitcoin is divisible by so many units means that it's not really THAT scarce.  The main unit of currency could be closer to the satoshi in the future, than it will be to trading 1 BTC per transaction.

I'm not saying that an entire 1BTC isn't scarce, i'm saying the units that are used to make transactions aren't scarce.  You don't need to have 1BTC total before you're able to make transactions.
Also, gold may be hard to mine and make use-able, but it isn't scarce.

Haha sure thing buddy.


I didn't say that, i'm saying that people will resort to using the smaller denominations, and that the smaller denominations are less scarce, and will likely be used despite the scarcity of full units.  The original comment compared them to diamonds.  But if the full units of bitcoin are too valuable to trade, I don't think it will effect it's adoption, because people can always trade with such small quantities of it that it shouldn't matter.


I haven't said anything complicated and you've confused yourself and made an ass out of yourself.   You're the one who's outed themselves as an idiot.
I'll repeat:

I hope your next message (Which will be blocked)  is well thought out dude.  Get help man, you need it.

Most people I know on the left are not looking into alternate ways to store their money, their looking at primary ways to start acquiring any.
This obviously isn't the case across the board and for everyone, but that's my personal observation for people I know, in the place I live.

He may he an enormous piece of crap, I dont know him personally, but him being the owner of a company that practices that sort of behavior doesnt mean he agrees with it. Unless I'm mistaken he has been fired from the company in the past, so there may he a lot of differing opinions and in-infighting.

Someone would have to find a flaw that no one has been able to exploit for the last 10 years.

I hope that it's at least that.

Anything positive for Bitcoin is awesome, but i'm skeptical about this.  At best won't this just be a trash Samsung app like all the other crap Samsung forces onto phones?  Who likes Bixby?  10 people in the entire world?  It's awful and annoying, especially with there being a physical button for it.  Is the "Samsung Crypto Wallet" app going to be any more useful than the other Samsung apps like, the Galaxy Store, Galaxy Wearable, Smart-Things, or Smart Switch?

It will only be banned in china until it isn't.  Just like every time they've banned trading bitcoin.  It was banned until it wasn't.

Exchanges that provide easily exportable documents that list your transactions in order to file taxes efficiently.

What's your guys' favorite websites for following bitcoin and crypto related news? I have none  besides these threads and looking at the price myself on coinmarketcap , so all suggestions would be appreciated.

Can someone explain to me how something like the halvening which has been an intended feature of Bitcoin since the beginning, can have an effect on the price later? How is it not already factored into the speculative price?  I'm seriously curious.

If its users care about adoption then this is only positive.

1 Million people in this sub and no one does anything but call each other retarded in the Daily Discussion post. Wonderful.

Lol, looking for news says nothing about my holdings. What if I short BTC exclusively?
