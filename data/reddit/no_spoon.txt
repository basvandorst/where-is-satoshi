T/F: our government has the ability to turn off all wireless and landline communication.

So wait, regular Coinbase is safe too?

Not saying the price isn't going up more, but using AOL is a pretty bad example of a pretty short sighted investment bubble. At the heart of the matter there is some
Inherent value of Bitcoin over the next 5-10 years. I haven't read nearly enough of that with regards to Bitcoin.

And you don't take issue with that?

It’s like that scene in the social network when Andrew garfields shares are diluted.
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:53:11
.5% of wallets own 87% of all bitcoin. Why the FUCK is that a better system?

Holy shit. Whatever happened to Alan Grayson?!

Actually i think you're missing the point. A cell phone also requires service, or a cell phone tower. This is why Facebook is trying to get in on their Aquila drone for these areas. Otherwise, a powered cell phone isn't going to be enough to overtake fiat currency in these situations. 
Also, on a different note, I would argue it IS a top priority right now. Bitcoin for a while was helping the people of Venezuela because of their fiat currency crisis. It is undoubtedly good PR for cryptocurrency technology as it can become a hedge against Fiat. The reverse is true in Puerto Rico, where having Bitcoin stored on a digital wallet that can't be powered or transferred has a real asset value of 0.

If I were in Puerto Rico right now I would say fuck your positivity on bitcoin. Just sayin
@_date: 2017-09-27 02:49:55
Except look what’s happening right now in Puerto Rico. No internet = no bitcoin. Cash only. How the fuck will bitcoin succeed when real problems still impede it?
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:05:46
I have to say, it's pretty nerve wracking just typing in your words and hoping that restores your account... This is not the best strategy moving forward but I guess I just have to trust it will work when I trade in my new phone.

Just curious, of current holding pool what percentage do you think are speculating ?

It’s just disheartening when the community rallies behind this marvelous technology but can’t step up to the plate when it really matters.
Also I really fail to recognize the correlation between supporting solar power as a reliable internet fuel and a rise in the use of bitcoin. You could say the same thing about the rise of cell phone usage (ubiquitous) but I don’t see solar panels saving Puerto Rico. Why would bitcoin change that?
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:03:53
Yeah, i mean, given all the hype and commotion and I didn't even know that was an option.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:34:23
So what happens if that gets stolen?
@_date: 2015-10-25 01:58:18
Don't you need some type of IP blocking mechanism?

How the fuck is there not one recommendation for an iOS wallet here? WTF am I suppose to do? Electrum? I trust my phone over my computer.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:20:13
How about answering the OP's question and saying whether breadwallet support BCC? And if so, why can't I find that information anywhere? This is really a cluster fuck, and I can't believe you're offering a fucking support hotline 4 days before the deadline. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:15:31
I dunno, maybe, cuz you know, some people have an iPhone?

Both of these options seem to require some sort of shipping and handling lol. C'mon
