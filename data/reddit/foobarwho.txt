Correlation is not causation

Lol, ok dude. Fud away.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:07:21
Correlation is not causation 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:29:32
No no no, that’s not how science works dude. You can’t rationalize away math.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:12:35
Dude it absolutely applies. People seeing correlation and assuming causation. This is a perfect example.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:19:57
Science requires more than one sample point to suggest causation. Just because you think this should happen maybe in your mind it sounds right doesn’t make it actually right. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:02:17
Hey everybody... important message here to all of Reddit. Correlation is not causation.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:18:24
No it’s not safe. It’s a guess. And possibly a really bad one. Most likely when they made that tweet was after there was an issue and it was already down. So it totally turns this correlation into one sample nonsense of people who want to believe.
If you want to be scientific about it, you need more than 1 sample point that you can point to. 
So more than one instance of btc sends going down and the tx rate dropping in half. The more instances you have the more statistically sure you have a real causation. 
A single sample like this though is just nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:27:11
The only person here rationalizing is you. I’m looking at from a scientific and statistical standpoint. You are the one trying to use logic and belief on a time series. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:25:43
Orrr they were never really spammers. Everybody I know right now is cashing out. Even long term hodlers 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:10:21
Correlation is not causation 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:28:48
Lol, and most importantly — you need more than one sample point. Which you don’t have. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:51:52
Your correct. It’s a totally different crypto that is built around bitcoin. Don’t listen to these fools. If it’s not as simple as send bitcoin to this address it’s not bitcoin. It’s open a channel to somewhere likely an exchange, deposit bitcoin into the channel ( how you open a channel without bitcoin in the first place to put the data on the chain I’m not sure ), then send to your recipient lightning address through the lightning network, having to choose different routes, then if you actually want your bitcoin you have to close the channel costing more btc. 
Imo this is an abomination.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:51:22
Many people are blind. If not most people. Especially those who got rich from bitcoin. 
It’s called survivorship bias and bitcoin has it bad. Real bad. It’s going to bite it in the butt big time.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:30:59
Honestly, I don’t think those answers are whole truths. Only showing the positive side without looking at arguments against fairly
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:00:02
So let’s do like lightning network which codifies business as the actual payment backbone into the core protocol and small blocks to force everybody to use it..... sounds to me like you are arguing for Bitcoin Cash.

Correlation is not causation 
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:03:34
He never confirmed it’s true, he’s just doing damage control from Reddit people going dumb. Whether it’s true or not, he has to affirm people.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:04:46
Correlation is not causation
Down voting this post does not make it untrue. The democratic process does not determine science and math. 
1 sample point is not causation. It’s a guess, and likely a bad one. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:46:12
Lol, what are you smoking?
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:35:47
Lol, no. You are just apparently ignorant of statistics. Which is fine, but you should basically not believe anybody assuming causation on the internet or your basically gonna be wrong most of the time. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:15:50
Yes, let’s force all vendors to adopt a ton of tech changes and force users to pay ridiculous fees to bend to the core developers will. 
Or you know, we could just increase block size like we will need to do anyway.,.. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:04:31
Or you know it never reaches enough velocity to escape gravity and falls back to earth in a spectacular crash
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:41:04
And now you understand the problem. Hubs. Lightning network is a centralized solution. Governments will regulate the hubs. And bitcoin just got taken over from within and even praised by Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:06:43
Hey there, maybe - just maybe - it’s not actually fud and the people proclaiming lighting is the second coming are the real problem. It’s amazing to me people can get so religious about obvious technical directions going in a way that is not to the users interests. Perhaps you should use some intuition here about what it all means and where it’s all going rather than being stuck in the details of how lighting works in a perfect world which doesn’t exist. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:50:45
Except it costs a shit ton of money to run a hub opening connections and getting others to connect to you... so it’s moot.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:41:22
I agree, but lightning with small blocks is not the answer. It’s just a different and bigger problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:49:53
That’s complete nonsense. If you are on a hub, and the hub requires identification your screwed. 
For all intents and purposes, hubs will be exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:29:30
Yes, if we can’t argue the ideas let’s attack the messenger. That’s like the last step right? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:56:48
When regulation occurs, it makes easy targets - even internationally due to treaties. It’s the hotel California. And you can never leave 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:41:46
On test net where opening connections are free. Great let’s all base our ideas in a world where money is free...
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:03:05
Bcash has no good long term plan either, but if it ever integrates segwit, core is basically dead. 
Core is dead to me anyway due to forced lightning network participation from the misguided insistence on keeping the block size at the same size forever. It’s a takeover from the inside and the Reddit mob is confused by rising price assuming that price premium means best approach and ideas. It unfortunately doesn’t. All it means that bandwagon gonna bandwagon until it doesn’t anymore and people s their pants.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:53:48
But if you never leave the lightning network, and indeed you won’t be able to ever, and the hubs are regulated by the government — there is no privacy, there is no protection, there is confiscation of funds, you get absolutely zero protection of the things that bitcoin stood to protect against. So great job, you just reinvented traditional banking.... Reddit mobs are not very smart. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:34:24
Yet... bitcoin is under 50% dominance again, and dropping. Litecoin massive rise is due to the fact that it actually works with low fees. People use it to transact on chain instead of bitcoin. Ltc is a contender for the number one spot. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:13:45
It’s going to maintain the fees at best. At worst going to make it a little less exponential. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:39:01
Except nobody is going to route through you if you have no meaningful connections. Same with the internet. Sure you can hook directly into the backbone, but nobody does.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:44:40
Except the only inexpensive way to get on the lightning network is through an exchange... so kinda moot.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:02:06
Sorry, I didn’t mean currently, I meant in the inevitable future. That wasn’t clear. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:07:22
Once you connect to a huge hub, sure. But that startup cost is real and cannot be discounted. It’s going to be enormous.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:58:52
No they cannot leave hubs. Let’s say bitcoin reaches 1m dollars in price. And let’s conservatively assume fees stay the same... then it’s going to cost 1000 dollars to leave the network. And that’s the conservative number! 
You are giving up your financial freedom, for the sake of an internet argument... 
And this is even assuming that hubs even allow you to leave the network in the first place without officially registering your bitcoin address with the government. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:25:49
If you can explain to me how exchanges cannot be regulated, and how exchanges won’t inevitably be the hubs, then I’ll shut the hell up. Otherwise this isn’t fud, this is reality. And reality is gonna hit you hard bud.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:56:09
Status quo competition is the problem. Bitcoin will fail if everybody has to use it completely differently than before in order to actually use it. It’s effectively a different coin. Lightning isn’t bitcoin. 
I mean, you could say if only everyone switched addresses, technology and etc to this other sub tech... however you could say the exact same thing if it was “if only everybody switched to this alt coin which is more scalable.” 
So it won’t work. We need to find a way to scale actual bitcoin in a totally backwards compatible way, or yes alt coins will fill in the void. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:03:29
Except that it costs money to open connections in the first place. A lot of money. Nobody will be able to afford to be anywhere but an exchange/huge hub. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:36:19
This sounds horrible... 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:28:25
Sure, just like people can use their cpu to mine still. It will be entirely pointless, just the same. Nobody will connect with you cause it will be too expensive to open a connection. So you are stuck at the big hubs. And SoL. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:19:07
It’s a couple hundred now, in a couple years, if Mcafee’s price predictions are true, it’s going to cost thousands upon thousands. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:08:37
So the answer to his criticism is don’t use the block chain... of course /eye roll
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:10:54
Neither me, but most people don’t have enough money to even pay the fees to move their funds into a hardware wallet in the first place. Bitcoin isn’t just for whales and middle class, it’s for the common people. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:56:59
It costs about 0.001 btc per on chain transaction. I’m not off. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:55:37
Your not looking at the details here. It costs money to open connections, and those costs are rising by the month. When bitcoin hits 1m per coin it’s going to cost at least 1k to open an on chain connection. Probably more.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:37:36
Ok, so run a hub that nobody uses. Sounds like a plan to do nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:50:10
Your not really understanding that financial freedom is going to cost a small fortune here are you? 
Yes all the proponents say is true. 
You can make your own hub.
You are not forced to use the lightning network, you can stay on chain if you like.
Etc etc
However nobody is factoring in cost. It’s going to be extremely expensive to be financially independent of a big exchange/hub. To the point where basically nobody can afford it.
So bitcoin is basically all lightning network from this point forward. It’s not bitcoin, it’s lightning coin. Get used to it - cause banks won. We lost.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:02:17
I have read up. I’m not wrong. 2 bitcoin txs will cost thousands of dollars in just a few years. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:54:25
1. Only if you’re a millionaire 
2. Says who? What if they say no without identification.
3. Also nonsense. Hubs are easy targets.
4. And pay 1k per connection to hook everybody up? Never going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:54:21
Good luck having meaningful connections without connecting to one of the big hubs.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:38:26
So your saying they accepted bitcoin but got rid of that whole pesky distributed ledger part... uhm, how is this censorship resistant bitcoin we all know and love anymore?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:51:58
And pay 1k per transaction when bitcoin hits 1m per coin, you’re insane
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:56:28
Good luck on that. Lawyers and congress gonna regulate these hubs. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:05:24
That’s kind of my point dude. Your going through hubs. These hubs do have the power to reject payments or connections. They aren’t forced to route if they can’t or won’t. There may be tumbler hubs which make it impossible to know the source, however those are already on the legal chopping block.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:48:02
I’m sorry I can’t hear a thing...
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:23:06
5 dollars today, 500 in the next few years. Scaling is a real issue. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:18:30
Scaling only with lightning network ensures that leaving the Lightning network and just putting coins in your personal wallet is crazy expensive. It's not a fix if done alone. That is the very definition of centralization. Where you can't leave the layer 2 network cause the hubs soak up the entire block bandwidth. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:40:26
So your arguing for centralized solutions then? Cause your saying that decentralized block chain payment solutions don't work.
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:35:26
Hypothetically of course. You know .. for a friend... ;)
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:57:09
That's not what I asked. Does your back testing include factoring in trading fees and slippage? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:50:21
Including fees in your back testing? What's the stats on its positive and negative trades? What's he draw down? How many trades per day does it make? Etc
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:14:16
Lite coin is the original fork, but they support that. It’s kind of hypocritical imo.

I spoke to this guy in pm and he refuses to provide data to back up his claims. Id recommend avoid. There are a number of freak incidences which could happen and he could lose all your money. Without proof that he can do what he claims, then he is either an amateur or a scam artist.

You can make many times Hodl profits if you trade really really good - but most people do not and won't. If you do be prepared to sustain big losses while you learn.
To answer your other question though, if you do day trade it's almost always better to accept the loss and trade your way back up. Otherwise you will only go right back to where you started - but if you accepted the loss and made more profits at the bottom then when the market gets back to 4500 you will be better off - again though this is only true if your good at it. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:06:46
Lol, you hodl guys are just delaying the inevitable. Let it dip. The big dip. The sooner we get this over with the sooner we can get back to a bull market. So sell. For great justice. Sell high buy lower. Smart money got out at 4900 or earlier. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:11:11
You guys are gonna have a bad time... This isn't the bottom of the dip. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:52:26
That's not good enough. Need the stats. All of it if you want to be trusted. 7 day trials aren't enough proof for long term viability.

Not to mention, the current Bitcoin market is not very good for short term gains. Putting money into crypto that you need to pay bills right now is a great way to not be able to pay your bills. 
Still there are things you can do to make money. If you have a car, you could be an uber driver for example - and it's totally on your schedule. So it won't interfere with your school work.
Remember, one bird in your hand is worth two in the bush. So, stick to things you are definitely going to get paid for.
