SegWit is first and foremost a malleability fix. This is why core wants to deploy it. Anything related to blocksizes, transaction fees and whatever this whole shebang of a debate throws in along with the kitchen sink, comes second to that.

Half of that BU% stayed up during the attack, showing that half of that percentage is fake signalling.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:53:28
It is most definitely possible to create a segwit transaction. The next step is distributing that transaction towards at least one mining pool. There's a bit of difficulty to be found there, i agree. There's no way to propagate a segwit transaction through nodes that don't accept it as a valid transaction.
But this isn't how it has to be done. You could create that transaction regardless though, and post it on all the forums of all the mining pools and state: i have this transaction, connect to me on &lt;insert IP adress here&gt; with a segwit miner and take, it's yours. Or heck, input it manually in any segwit miner. Either works to mine a block with the tx inside it.
Of course no node will accept that block unless the nodes accept segwit transactions and such blocks. So basically until core pushes a new software update with segwit active and people start using that, or core activates it in currently released software that people are already using.
And yes, that block becomes rather useless if segwit isn't released at the same time, because the rest of the mining world will mine more blocks than that single pool probably could mine. That transaction doesn't quite become unmineable because of this though, at least not until whoever posted it puts a non-segwit transaction in circulation that also uses that same UTXO used in this original fictional segiwt transaction. 
Depending on how juicy you make that fee, you can actually bait miners to prepare for mining it, for when segwit gets pushed through.

antpool is signalling BU though
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:00:28
Actually, segwit signalling can be construed as voting because this is part of Blockstream's deployment plan. But BU is scheduled to release on april 1st 2017 regardless of signalling rates (no joke actually, although any software release date on aprils fools is a joke imho). The fact they say they need 51%, is because this technicality will kill their chain if they don't have it. Statistically speaking that is of course, but this actually takes a lot of dimwitted assumptions with it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:59:02
I recently wrote an article on surviving a 51% attack as a bitcoin user: 
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:50:07
remember: they can't simultaneously spend their mining power on Roger Unlimited and BTC at the same time. that means that the current 30% dedicated to not forking would become the 100%.

isn't it possible to (manually) retrieve the private key that was generated, before performing any transactions?

Thank you for your time and effort, this clears some things up for me.
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:21:17


Ah yes there is a steady rate for mined blocks, but with a variable rate of transactions, there's still a variable timeframe for when any given transaction will be verified.

we can softfork our way to this hybrid destination without ditching the decentralized nature of PoW:

that's not the only possible attack vector in a pure PoW based arbitration environment like Bitcoin, i did a small writeup on this:

This is always what happens around difficulty adjustments.
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:58:33
I've come up with an idea to create that incentive: 
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:31:44
This goes directly against the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. I've written about this part as well in my article, but really the point boils down to this:
I want my transaction public from the moment of creation. I might only want a specific arbitrator or set of arbitrators to handle it, but to privately circumvent the "transaction relay network" layer just to have my fees not end up with a threatening power goes against the principles of bitcoin in every aspect.
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:09:40
Dirt Sanchez?
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:17:37
I'll say it as I've said before: If you don't have the private key, it's not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:01:30
As a user there's a couple options to "survive" a 51% attack (I've written a medium article about it here: 
Practically speaking, it's is in everyone's best interest to prevent the situation altogether. But mining empty blocks as a 51% attack, as a mining business, isn't sustainable.
Although under current conditions where there's still bitcoins being churned out with each block as a reward, meaning they get to have coins resulting from this. But these coins aren't really spendable during a empty-block-spam-51% attack, unless they let their own transactions through.
But as I describe in my article, this wouldn't really be Bitcoin anymore. Nobody would want to deal with this unusable chain. At the very least, not for the duration of this attack. As it's use becomes nil, so does its value.
My point is mostly that, despite the disturbance, each attacker in this sense will play him/her-self out of the picture like this. Although we don't want this disturbance in the first place (for all the obvious reasons), we can (theoretically) HODL our way through this.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:43:20
I've been thinking of making a BIP to give bitcoin users the power to divert their fees from miners they dont want to support, by including a rule that allows for transactions to only be added to a block when the coinbase transaction in the block points to an address that you allow in your transaction.
My writeup of the concept is on medium: 
edit: minor clarification, this is advocating for an option for users to use whenever they feel like it, not a mandatory "pick your poison" mandate.

It just shows how valid his opions are as a developer, if you look at how well adopted Bitcoin Classic is nowadays.
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:52:21
Before we do anything in this direction, we can make a less rigorous softfork that instead gives more economic power to the Bitcoin users: 
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:56:29
1. 90% dont have to give a shit. If core adopts it for example, the software run on 80% of the nodes will give the needed shit, as happens right now with segwit
2. users dont necessarily need to do anything complicated. wallets can facillitate so much in this. categorize mining pools per proposal, auto filling in the preffered coinbase address, etc.
3. this mostly points back to my response on  but to reiterate: people dont have to follow the debate. i'm not calling for every transaction to make that decision. just for those who care
4. miners seem to care about power more than anything, at least those without ethics. they'll remove the 21m cap if they can make it so. it just shows what they care about, i something we can ignore because we can either softfork ourselves away from their stupidities or theyll hardfork themselves away. maybe this wont hurt them in their wallets at first. it doesnt have to. at some point though, fees are all what's left for these arbitrating parties. imagine pushing a proposal like this when we've reached that point in time...
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:19:35
until then, we can divert our fees away from them:

I have questions about following theoretical scenario:
Non BIP148 nodes that stay unupgraded keep seeing non-signalling blocks at a majority. The Segwit deadline hits (november right?), still no majority signalling SW. SW activates on the BIP148 nodes. SW doesn't activate on the legacy nodes.
1. Does a SW deadline extension proposal still allow for the same outcome as your description of a chain resolution in that case? (specifically this one you mentioned: Legacy miners are compelled by the economy to switch to BIP148 after Aug 1st. Chain split gets resolved.)
2. If majority hashrate occurs on the non-legacy chain after the deadline, do legacy nodes still reorg even though SegWit has been "cancelled" on those (for the time being)? Are segwit blocks (is that the correct term?) then valid for the legacy nodes?

The point is that, when X is exclusively provable for only one subject, if on subject Y it can not be proven nor disproved, any substitute for Y is equally "not yet proven". 
Right now there's as much proof for him to be Satoshi as the hamster mentioned in the other comments. The fact that there is no proof against any of those to be Satoshi is not relevant, because "not being satoshi" is not of importance.

the logic gate setup might be patented, or at least the functional design of what that would try to achieve. It wouldn't even have to be a hardware patent, it's just that ASIC directly implements these logic gate setups as hardware without any software coming in between there. As such, it's not even close to "patenting maths".
I totally agree with you on how it's shit though, and that we are in need of a PoW change.

@_date: 2017-05-14 02:09:01
That's boiling it down a bit too much don't you think? 
I mean I totally agree that using an address one time at most, is best practice, and for privacy reasons should be the only practice.
But you can actually receive multiple times on a single address, and after having spent all of that, receive some more on that same address and still be able to spend that. Even with HD wallets and all the fancy stuff.  
Or am I missing something vital here?
@_date: 2017-05-08 07:57:21
Do i get the following right?
In terms of functionality, the Bitcoin network has 2 layers: the transaction relay tier, and the transaction arbitration tier. The first is irreplaceable but requires an implementation of the second for it to be of value. The implementation of the second however, is (in theory) replaceable.
I'm curious as to how close I am to actually understanding Bitcoin. It is a difficult thing after all.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:24:24
Which concept of anonymity are we applying here? 
In essence, Bitcoin couldn't care less which user is behind a private key. 
But as transactions are sent by clients without encryption, it is definitely possible to see which device made the initial broadcast (by ISP's at the very least).
Once again though, although the device may have made the broadcast, theoretically, the device may just be a "dumb" sending device, without any knowledge of for example the private key behind the spent transaction's input.
On top of this, it is impossible to tell (under good circumstances) who is a recepient of a transaction, in the case where nobody has used any outputs yet of the address the bitocins were sent to.
Am I missing something here? Genuinely curious.

I wrote a medium article on softforking to only include transactions in blocks that specifically have a coinbase address that the transaction allows:  (allthough the article doesn't dive into actual low-level protocol mechanics, I'm still diving into that subject matter, sorry!)
But your proposal seems to make much more sense! It is much more decoupled, away from targeting individual mining pools and consequently away from all the politics, and abstractly aimed much more accurately at actually targeting technological progress declared on-chain!
You're a boon to Bitcoin. Without a doubt.

@_date: 2017-06-26 09:23:50
The technology allows for you to no longer have to trust anyone. You have a private key of an address to which bitcoins can be sent. All you need is a valid transaction that sends to said address, that will be mined into a block according to the fee of said transaction. Then thereafter, with your private key, you can create a valid transaction that uses the unspent output of the aforementioned transaction you received. You can send with your transaction, your Bitcoins to any other address you so desire.
You have none of this on Coinbase. You have the promise of Bitcoins. They have full control over anything you have on Coinbase, and you effectively have nothing.
It takes the hard way to learn this for some, accounts closed and no customer support after sending to one address that Coinbase deemed "bad". One uses Bitcoin to get away from these maliciously maligned practices that banks use. And then Coinbase does the exact same thing. You don't actually have Bitcoins on Coinbase. You have an account on Coinbase. You have a promise from someone that cannot be trusted, but regardless: use Bitcoin correctly and you don't need to trust.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:10:08
That's the point: you don't get to have the private key.
Buying from Coinbase literally means you don't own the Bitcoins you've bought. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:58:01
Oh sure they promise this to you that they'll send you. So if you're willing to put your trust in them then that's on you.
But this is the opposite of what Bitcoin is about. Either you have them or you don't, trust is worthless because without the private key you have nothing and with the private key you have full access.
