Just check the price the next couple of days. And check out what bitcoin/illuminati tries to accomplish: "The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power. "The order of the day," they wrote in their general statutes, "is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them." Sounds like bitcoin to me. /s

The article is not negative. It is not anti Bitcoin at all. It is simply an attempt to make the bank seem hip and down with the newest buzz word in banking: Bitcoin. This sub is way too paranoid regarding banks. Banks will be the first to adopt the technology. In two years everyone will want to be part of this "world wide ledger".

We = the people that want bitcoin to become mainstream. Different reasons for that, not just to get rich.
More adoption = less volatility.

I just tipped some of my most bitcoin-sceptic friends on google plus, this is hilarious.
