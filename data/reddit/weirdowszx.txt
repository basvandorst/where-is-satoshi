Huh interesting and is there other online payment options with it.  
This would make liquidating my money to BTC way easier.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:18:28
What'd you pay for the transaction
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:43:45
Now that's fucking interesting hahah.
I wonder if the government can still see how much BTC I own then o_o.
(I'd still do taxes because I don't want a fine)
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:22:42
I'm just buying some more anyway.  
Still up a hefty amount from when I started :)!

It has to drop 6k for me to lose money on it :")
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:25:29
Or very misinformed.
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:12:40
Thanks to you all for a great explanation :).  
I learn more about BTC everyday.

I bought some more btc at 9000 and 0 regrets have been made.

I'm definitely not investing money I can't afford to lose don't worry about that.
I'm keeping this money and I'm not rushing buying/selling on short.
Also definitely holding on to it.

Who said I wanted one of them crying turds.  
Nah mate I'm keeping it all.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:36:35
I'm honestly very excited to see what it does this year.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:43:05
I mean duh.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:08:13
You mean an USB stick instead of a digital wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:07:40
This might be one of the most accurate descriptions of how long to hold on.  
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:08:27
BTC Has no steady gains though I mean It's extremely volatile.  
I'td take me years to retire with the current economy :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:13:13
Hell yeah, I'm only investing small bits I can afford though :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:35:26
I'm currently 24 Years of age so that'l be a long ass time.  
Hello money in 2060-65\~ ish

@_date: 2019-05-14 10:51:08

In hindsight they regret it.
