Oh ok, funny I constantly read bitcoiners here post about how you are ALL still early adopters till this day.  I guess that only holds true when it's convenient for you.  So which is it, can I become an early adopter, or have I missed the train?

It's ok, my banks email gets hacked on a regular basis.  Oh wait, it doesn't, my bank is actually secure and not run by a bunch of amateurs.  Yet another bitcoin company who fails miserably at security.  How long until the big exchange hack and all your bitcoin goes missing?  Let me guess, during the next price free fall?  What a joke.

Yea it'll change everything alright.  3 transactions per second at a time.  You guys bitch about inflation like you've been holding dollars since 1914.  Most of you aren't even in your 20s, so I'm not sure why you care about 2% inflation per year while worshipping a pretend currency which has been declining for the last 15 months losing roughly 80% of its value.

Well if a consistently laughably retarded blog with the word "institute" in it says there's no image problem, it must be true.  How about go load up any MSM article about bitcoin outside of this echo chamber and see the response it gets.  Hell, take a look at default subs when the word bitcoin is mentioned.  Overall mockery every time.
@_date: 2015-04-05 20:33:35
Does not work for wikipedia either.  Or but hey lets accept bitcoin even though it will consistently make merchants less money!

That is exactly what that means.  Willy was definitely responsible or the November 2013 bubble.  Markus may or may not have been responsible for the bubble in April 2013.  Nobody here will admit those bots exist though because that would admit they all paid too much for their digital beanie babies and are all bag holders.  Hence the down votes your post got.

And yet the transaction volume usd hasnt risen in 15 months.  Aka no new users in 15 months.  Aka complete and total ecosystem stagnation.  But people are spamming the block chain with chain transactions so you have that going for you which is nice.

Ahh here's the best part!  The mod of this subreddit, theymos owns bitcointalk.org.  He's also one of three people to hold the emergency alert.  Satoshi being the second, Gavin being the third.  But wait, there's more.  Theymos stole $1.5 million from the community via donations that he was supposed to use to upgrade the website.  So not only is bitcointalk.org owned by a thief, not only is this subreddit managed by a thief, but the thief is one of two people that we know of to hold the emergency key to the bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 00:22:06
The general public doesn't care either, so why should the media?  Public stopped caring about funbux in November 2013.  That's why the transaction volume USD has remained unchanged for the last 15 months while the price slides closer towards double digits.

I don't care if it ever gets developed, he's paying his friends (and himself if I recall) who have no experience $2-300,000 a year to write software that already exists.  At worst he fully scammed you guys out of your money.  At best he embezzled $1.5 million under the guise of forum software.  He's paying him and his developers more money than Gavin receives to develop the bitcoin protocol.  Which is already far more than your average programmers salary.  So like I said, at the very best case scenario....embezzlement.
Edit: Meant to reply to the person below me.

Jeez when you say it like that, it's almost like bitcoin is a complete joke.  And then I remember that 50% of the original bitcoin foundation members are now felons, Theymos, an accepted scammer runs the two biggest social outlets for bitcoin, and the protocol itself strongly resembles a ponzi scheme...and then I think bitcoin just may be a joke after-all!

Yes, I'm sure you had no intent on advertising your service when you dropped your link into the second sentence of your useless review.  How about remove it if it wasn't your intent.  Or at least admit that's the entire purpose of this post.

The answer is painfully obvious.  Most people dont do illegal things.  The only use case for bitcoin is illegal things.  Therefore nobody uses bitcoin.  Its pointless, hard to secure, scam heaven, and associated with criminals.  Need any other obvious questions answered while I am here?

Calling Ron or Rand Paul a presidential candidate is the equivalent of writing your name on the ballet and calling yourself a presidential candidate.  No chance at election and only caters to people who are borderline insane or in a state of psychosis.

God you people are smug as fuck.  Basement dwelling neck beard knows better than media tycoon who owns hundreds of different media outlets across the world.  Yup, they should totally accept bitcoin, a currency which is held by roughly 250,000 people in the entire world.  Yup, I'm sure that'll net them loads of profit.  Let's ask Wordpress how they are doing after accepting bitcoin.  Oh yea they stopped accepting it because they only got 2 sales per week from it.  Well that's just one company, let's ask Overstock.  Oh they were $3 million under their projected revenue with bitcoin and received almost no international sales.  Well that's just two companies, surely bitcoin is mainstream regardless of two companies.  Let's ask Firefox.  Oh wait, their A/B testing revealed a loss to the tune of $144,000 over 23 days by mentioning bitcoin on their website.  Well jeez maybe bitcoin isn't right for those businesses, let's ask how it's going.  Oh right, he projected 8% (?) losses in revenue by accepting bitcoin.  
But still, WSJ should totally accept bitcoin so you can be rich by doing jack shit.

Yup, just like he secured blockchain.info right?

Yea I'm sure he's really butt hurt about not losing 80% of his money with the worst performing asset 2 years running.

What planet are you from?  The price of bitcoin has been steadily decreasing for 15 months.  The transnational volume USD unchanged for 15 months.  Retail sales are non existent.  The ecosystem has completely stagnated.  And scams and hacks run rampant cleaning up the scraps on a daily basis.
Yes I'm sure he's super mad he missed the train.  I routinely lose sleep that Bearnie Madoff never called me up for investment opportunities, sulk that I didn't invest in beanie babies, and beat myself up over not going all in on pogs.
We don't care about bitcoin, the only people who do are its 250,000 current world wide users.  It's an obscure libertarian toy that will never be used outside of illegal use cases.  So yes, we missed the ponzi express, boo hoo.
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:35:20
Because the bots almost certainly used fake USD to buy those bitcoins?  Hence it was purely manipulation.

Nope, that's me.  Sorry to disappoint.  Nice joke though (bitbubbly?)

$60,000 or $1.5 million, he was donated funds almost 2 years ago and hasn't produced jack shit for it.  No matter how you slice it, this is just another scam in the bitcoin community.  Doesn't matter if it's Antonopoulos promoting scams or pushing malware on you guys, Theymos stealing 6,000 bitcoins, or Roger Ver vouching  for Mt Gox days before it imploded.  Bitcoin is ripe with scammers from the top down.  Community leaders, businesses exit scamming, or low level ponzi schemes being promoted on bitcointalk.org.  Bitcoin is scam city from the top down, and this is just another peg in the board.   Not a surprise considering the bitcoin foundation itself was founded by 50% felons and paid their employees outlandish salaries to deliver nothing back to the community.  And yet there will be apologists for every one of these scams, partly pure denial and partly pure delusion.

By 1997 Amazon, eBay and Hotmail, and many others were booming businesses.  By 1997 the internet had 70 million users.  By 1998 it would have 147 million and Paypal would come to life.
In that same amount of time bitcoin has no clear use case, and well under 1 million users.  
You are just blatantly lying, and it's sad.  By the way, you see that key next to the "Z" that says shift?  Try holding it down at the beginning of sentences.  It'll save yourself the embarrassment of looking like a dumb ass when you're trying to sound like you know what you are talking about.

Nobody gives a fuck if it meets the exact definition of a ponzi you clown, the result is the exact same.  Maybe once the dust settles we will get a new word to describe the disruptive scamming potential of bitcoin.
