You can have it all, just not on 1st generation blockchain tech. Bitcoin is a great start but it can't deliver on the ideals it sells.

Oxford would have it *Hyperbitcoini**s**ation* as it is with the Queen's English.

That scoop cost you $9 tomorrow my friend.

A bitcoin fork which is misleading newcomers into thinking it is the bitcoin everyone is talking about. It is a different currency with a leader with questionable motives.

Really? I moved some funds around a few days ago and paid about a dollar per transaction.

Thanks for the tip!

It's about the mindset of a risk-reward equation.
I came into this expecting to either **lose everything or make it back ten fold**.
In that situation I only need to put in a small amount. Only as much as I am capable losing and because the flip side is making it back ten fold or even more, the smaller initial investment becomes worthwhile. Nobody knows how this will end so the *odds* may as well be 50/50, that's some seriously positive expected value.

Until utilities take payment in bitcoin, there will always be coins on the market through the miners trying to pay their bills.

Yeah shorting a limited supply sounds quite risky. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:36
Only if your measure your self worth purely by fiat. Many of us consider Bitcoin an alternative currency, not just a market.

I thought it was sell ass, eat a dick and suck drugs.

You have a point. Although in my example it's taking a passive stance (holding) as opposed to an active one (seeking investment).

[What an absolute rollercoaster] (

This is indeed the basis of money. As more people jump on board the bitcoin train, the more stable it becomes.
By people I mean individual entities, not the amount of fiat "pumped in". I suppose this can be measurable by transactions + exchange sign ups.

That's the futures market at work. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:21:44
Absolutely not. You risked $50 and doubled it. Put in as much as you're prepared to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:27:13
Make the payment with bitcoin :)

I wonder if it's possible to have something that can be both recoverable and unseizable. They are both the same actions albeit with different intentions.

A paper wallet is only as secure as the way they do transactions.
Correct me if I'm wrong :)

1 wallet with all of the coins sounds a little...insecure.

Exactly this. I was asking my colleague yesterday "Would you buy a Tesla today for 10BTC?". He thought for a bit and said exactly what I was getting at; "I don't think I would be happy with my Tesla in 2 years from now knowing that I could have effectively paid a million for it".

I'm fairly new to this so forgive my ignorance. Where does the private key encryption happen? You have the private key but then this would need to be encrypted before being sent to the queue for the miners, right? How would you avoid the private key being compromised between digital input and encryption?

Can we buy reddit gold with bitcoin? If not I think that would be a great idea. Let's make it rain!

It's a bubble.
A bubble in the sense that because you were a tech-savvy early adopter, you would have been clicking tech articles about bitcoin.
2017 granny is seeing it in the news bulletin.

Enough to drive the value up considerably if proven it was forever lost at 2.4% of the total circulation.

New hodler here. Where are you getting 300 billion from? And am I correct to have calculated a ~$160 billion value at the moment?
