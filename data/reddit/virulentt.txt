"The pattern behind the majority words on the list is clear; Intersection of politics and technology, invariably paints government action as incompetent or corrupt."
Premise  Subreddit doesn't want to have politics in it's discussion and instead wants to focus on technology. 
Premise  only shills and government agencies trying to oppress the people and blah blah blah would not want to have a discussion about politics. 
Only logical conclusion: is a government conspiracy trying to cover up the truth through censorship from the ever-prying and always right freedom fighter conspiracy theorists. 
Yup.

You do need to know the specifics of the rules though...

If he was banned from the internet... Then how is he here? I guess the "ban" isn't exactly enforceable, is it?

I think your qualifications for something being an "indisputable fact" is different from rational thinker's qualifications

And any student in principles of macroeconomics can give a basic explanation of why.... It's not an awful action to infuse the money supply in a recession.

I'd love you to dismantle Keynesian economics for me. I'm sure you know better than almost all reputable academics who devote their life to the subject

I don't think you understand what he saying about overall sales. Let's suppose this...
2010 let's say 1 million smartphones were sold. 
600,000 iPhones = 60% of the market share
350,000 androids = 35% of the market share
150,000 blackberries =15% of the market share
Now let's say in 2014 10 million were sold
5,000,000 iPhones = 50% of the market share 
4,000,000 androids = 40% of the market share
1,000,000 blackberries = 10% market share. 
The change in iPhone sales is 730%
1042% change for androids. 
Who cares about blackberries? 
In my example, iPhone sells 4.4 million more iPhones. Android sells 3,650,000 more. Apple sold more, more people DID NOT start buying androids instead of iPhones, but androids phones have a bigger market share. So I think this example sufficiently shows that you're off base in your assumptions.

You compare it to gold forgetting that gold has long been outdated as a viable currency. And because bitcoin isn't a physical entity per say and there is a limited amount, it is absolutely subject to deflation over time.

And if one person bought an iPhone over an android, it invalidates your comment... That's just stupid. I can also make arbitrary comments that "end the conversation" when they really have no canonical value. Stop being ignorant.

I wouldn't consider you contributed incorrect facts to the conversation as "adding to the conversation." See my comment somewhere below that explains why you can lose market shares and sell more.
