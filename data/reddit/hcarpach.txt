If you read the news and check the links you will find a link to the official press release from the Ministry of Justice. The same goes for all the previous news (I'm assuming you know how to read).

This case is different, as you can read in the official press release, the bitcoiners were arrested for selling bitcoin mining equipment on Mercado Libre, the latin eBay.

Makes reversible what want to be kept irreversible. Seems like a major change to me.

Funny, the ones altering Bitcoin protocol are Core Developers. Read Satoshi's Bitcoin White Paper. Just the first paragraph contradicts RBF.
"With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads."

The way we do this in Venezuela is through a Bitcoin Facebook Group. We go to the group, publish a 'buying bitcoins' post or search for a 'selling bitcoins' post. We make the arrangement with the other person (ask for references or use an intermediary from the group, usually an Admin, if necessary) and we carry on the deal.
This is the fastest and cheapest way to buy/sell bitcoins, p2p way, from person to person.
You only need a personal wallet, which you can get here: 
And a Facebook Group in your Country/City that has some reputation.

This is absurd. There's no "blockchain technology". That's not even how you spell it. It's block chain, because is a chain of blocks. And is not a technology, is part of a technology, Bitcoin technology.
Calling Bitcoin technology "blockchain technology" is like calling a car "wheel".
