I fucked on both of those. Sold my NEO when it broke even... and then it exploded :/
At the time of the Bitcoin fork, all my money was in alts and I was afraid to sell them at a loss. So I didn't even manage to claim any Bitcoin cash. (Seriously, I wish I was making this up.)

Absolutely true. :/

I sold NEO before it exploded. I know. I wish I was making this up.

That's what I keep telling myself. But every day I watch the BTC value of my portfolio keep tanking. My alts aren't even worth 200 anymore, it's 195 BTC at the moment. :/

If BTC goes up, alts keep going down. If BTC goes down, everyone in crypto panics, and alts also go down. It's shitty any way I look at it.

NEO and XRP, ok. Why Monaco, though?

I'm measuring the altcoins against BTC, not fiat. Monero might look more stable when measured against USD, but in terms of actual Bitcoin value, it's down 30% from what I bought it for.
Honestly, Monero is the good news in all of this. Most of my alts are down 50 to 70% in BTC value.

That's a perfect way of describing it actually...
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:36:36
It's a throwaway account... for obvious reasons.

I sold off my NEO as soon as it broke even. :/ Honestly, I wish I was making this story up.


I believe that. That's probably why I got too greedy and made so many mistakes.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:56:08
You're right. I was just so glad that even one of the coins broke even that I panicked and sold right away.

... I think I have enough Sia to make me puke every time I think about it. I bought it at around 500-600 satoshis, and watching it go down every single day has been brutal.

What coins increased 10x in value?
It's actually quite possible to buy most coins at their peak; you buy into the hype, thinking it'll go even higher, and don't use your common sense. I'm not the only one who made this mistake, just maybe on a larger scale than most.
