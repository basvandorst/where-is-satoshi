It could be. The psychology behind it is more difficult though. People can process $1 and $10 a lot easier than $10,000 and $100,000. I think that will be a hindrance. But we'll see.

Besides futures, the media hype is pretty much gone. 
People need to buy btc for the price to go up. It had it's spot in the news, it's kinda over now. 
Time to pick up as much as you can before the next news bull run. 
Could be years though. Or days. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:29:36
This is fucking moronic. 




If a coin that is worth like $0.000001 is pegged to the dollar, and there's a shit ton of money in it, for example, do you not understand how that's a problem?
I personally think anyone holding tether is going to get fucked (obviously) when there's a bank run, btc and all the alts will dip as normal, and things will carry on when they all rise again and it won't be a huge deal. But will be a buying opportunity. I don't think it will cripple crypto. 
But everything you said is ridiculous. The only thing that saved it is the better replies below your terribly-thought-out paragraphs.

Alts are valued in BTC and ETH usually. When those two rise, the value of alts go up, because that's the currency they're valued in. CMC then translates that into usd for your convenience. You're much better off looking at the ratios between all of them to get a better idea of what's going on with them. 
If CartinaAlt is valued at 1 BTC and 1 BTC is valued at $20,000, then the value of BTC drops to $10k, but CartinaAlt is still valued at 1 BTC because nobody bought or sold anything and they like it long-term, then without any trading or change in CartinaAlt true value it just lost half it's value in usd to $10k because it's still worth 1 BTC. 
Same thing applies in the other direction.

People like to feel smarter than others. It's the same feeling when it goes up a lot, and some nerds are really happy they made crazy gains over the normies who didn't believe in them. When it crashes, the normies are happy the weird nerds got their comeuppance for their magic internet money, while everyone else has to work hard for their money and not risk it gambling.

Your understand of btc doesn't change the way the market or people emotionally feel about it. You didn't ask if you're right about it or not, you asked why people feel the things they do.

Yeah, if people would get off their butts and a wallet developer whipped up something nice. He could just do it for free and put ads on or whatever I wouldn't care and make the money back in no time. 
We need someone to step up and code this thing, it shouldn't take more than a few days and a few cups of coffee, we could be using it this weekend.

So just get a wallet developer to whip up a UI that's pretty and user-friendly. We'll have this shit done this week.

You've gotta be careful. If your smart gf keeps buying the dips better than you, she's gonna end up with more btc than you. Then what will be the point of keeping you around? 
I wouldn't leave the computer for the next 48 hrs if I were you, make sure to get in at a good price point to maximize gains. Better if you distract her and send her on errands and keep her away from crypto news (hide her phone) so you can scoop some up on the cheap while she doesn't even know what's happening.

Not to mention, if you've got any decent stockpile of btc or another popular one, you're good to go in the crypto space amongst your peers. But try to tell a somewhat "quirky" or "nerdy" girl that you're into some fork or whatever, she's most likely only heard of btc before and won't really give a shit. You can let her know you're way up % wise, but she's going to think that's fake money, even if she understands digital currency a little bit. 
You're better off going with the winner in this case, and not some random 3-letter garbage nobody has heard of. 
"My coin has been on CNN 3x today" is a lot better line than "My coin has been on a wordpress blog once by some fanatic."

Whoever set up the futures contracts to expire right around now. They probably just set it up for an expiration right around when the announcements were going to be made. That would be good timing for shorting right at the finish line, make a quick few hundred bucks to top off their short.

@_date: 2018-01-04 15:21:11
That's because you can't move any funds with btc anymore. It takes too long and is too expensive. I like btc a lot but the market will decide the price, and right now it's one of the worst-performing coins based on ease of use and price. Probably a good time to buy until they fix the broken coin though. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:15:03
This may surprise you, but it used to be at a different price at previous times. Forks have happened many times. The first one was like 1 year give or take after it was created, and the first and only security flaw discovered was exploited, while it was worth basically nothing.

So who's holding all this tether? How does the price not fluctuate on the bad news? I certainly wouldn't buy any for one dollar each. It seems to me like they just told everyone it's worth one dollar and everyone believes them and trades it at that, which seems pretty stupid. But I don't really get who's all buying it besides bitfinex and keeping the price so stable. 
Imo the holders of tether are going to get burned, btc and the market with crash a bit, then recover, as usual. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:49:33
You don't want to do too many activities with your gf that she's better at. 
She wants to see you as the stable provider and protector. When you're fumbling around with stuff that's easy to her, yeah maybe it's endearing the first time (and I truly hope ice skating is the first time) but a few more instances of this and she'll see you lower on the social status ladder and look towards someone else who can laughingly best her at her hobby activities. 
You're treading on thin ice with this, if you'll excuse the pun. I would suggest you don't allow her to go to the ice rink anymore unless you seriously improve. Do other activities together that you are much better than her at so she'll be impressed by your masculinity. There's a good chance she'll leave you otherwise. 
Btc would be a good example, she probably doesn't know anything about that. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:33:00
If you want to hold it, don't move it. Then you don't have to pay the fee. Just hold it. 
And for your other question


You'd just be making two transactions it looks like. One to the wallet you want to transact with, and a second to the other wallet you would want to "dump" the rest into. But since you have very little, just hold it where it is for now, as long as it is safe.

It's still all a gamble at this point, and nobody is really going to be deemed smarter in the end, until we see how the gamble runs its course.

Make sure you don't get fucked by fees or you'll lose your $100 very quickly. You can make good gains on alts, but those are even more risky than btc, and you could also lose your $100 very easily there. Not to mention volatile exchange rates between cryptos. 
My advice is to put it into something you believe in and leave it there for a few years. Or gamble it and see if you get lucky. It really depends on how much you value that $100. 
Personally, I'd spend it on a nice Japanese girl and see if she's into anything kinky, to get the most out of my money. I recommend considering that first.

Do Venezuelans cash out the crypto somewhere or do they just trade it with each other?  
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:19:55
You're welcome. Remember to watch the exchange between crypto currencies to get the best deal. Sometimes they all kinda follow each other, so when one is cheap, the other you need to exchange it with is also down, so they exchange rate ends up being the same when they're both up. It's tricky to find the best deal. 
And then you're also dealing with really long wait times and high fees with btc like you already know. 
Good luck with everything! And like the other guy said, make sure to not store your money on an exchange, they could steal it. Or get "hacked".

Sure, but not all coins get lost. Hundreds of trillions of dollars is still a big market cap, even if some are lost. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:31
They shouldn't let you buy if it's just going to go down right after. Look at what's happening now. There should be a buffer period at least so you can see what will happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:27:59
Ok, but can you let them know for me? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:14
No I don't have to pay rent. I'm not a sucker. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:54:09

Why are people *such* douchebags?
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:51:57
No, it's in the constitution. A third term would be illegal. A president even tried that once and it came out that he couldn't do it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:39:47
Why? They have long positions too. And they equal the amount of short positions. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:52:06
You make a lot of really good points. However, I'm now more confused than ever about what ecocash actually is. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:39:45
Then it worked!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:47:35
China's exchanges are gone? I thought they had like 40% of btc and mined most of it with huge mining centers or something. 
Can you tell me the story on China? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:50:03
Were there taxes a few years ago when things weren't so bad? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:59:15
This is pretty bad advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:21:41
But, is it an actual crypto? Does it use a blockchain for example? Or is it a payment processing method for fiat? If it's a combination of both like you say, then how does it work? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:17:37
I've been thinking about it. Can you incorporate this into online payments too, please? That would be really convenient. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:40:57
Why is xrb constantly being shilled all over the daily discussion posts lately? A lot of it gets deleted but usually it doesn't even have anything to do with what people are talking about. Which makes it seem very suspect. Also, the fact that you can't buy it anywhere besides super sketchy exchanges that will steal all of your money. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:57:31
Really good find, thanks! But it still doesn't explain what exactly ecocash is. Nowhere I've found does either. I really don't think it's a crypto, it seems like that would be mentioned specifically all over the place. I still think it's probably a paypal-type service. But it doesn't mention that, nor does it say what currency it's using. There's pretty much no details in the article or anywhere I can find on what type of money it actually is, rather just saying that ecocash is being used, and giving the background of it being used. 
Weird. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:42:42
Could someone fork it to be permanent? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:14:50
Lol bro let him trade if he wants. 
Crypto may not be for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:00:56
Nice links, thanks. I remember reading many places though that they have huge mining operations there. Not sure how that fits in with their exchanges shutting down. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:44:51
You forgot the step about not paying rent like a sucker. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:14:09
10k would be a better time to buy. You would get more btc than at 14k. 
In fact, if you could get it for 7-8k that would be even better.

You're welcome. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:51:41
Lol yeah that's true. And so is paypal haha. But it was pretty interesting to read all about this stuff and the troubles/solutions of a major liquidity problem Zimbabwe is having. So thanks for letting me know about it originally. I know a shit ton more about local Zimbabwe finances now haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:08:28
It should be a two-way street, like you and your wife. Unlike this guy who had to beg his wife for months to invest $1000 in something he's really interested in, and is now scared out of his mind about what to do since the investment temporarily went down, which happens.

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:02:57
Sounds like she's wearing the pants in this relationship. You shouldn't be afraid to spend the money you make on things you want without having to beg her for months. That's not how a healthy relationship works son.
She'll respect you more if you tell her to butt out and let you handle it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:24:50
It looks like it's working too.

That sounds right, but be careful to not lose all your money on high fees and bad exchange rates. Because that can happen very easily. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:13:43
I saw the video of that guy freaking out and it was really funny. 
But the way they're trying to shove it down everyone's throats is weird. However the way this sub has such a crazy hate boner for it where some days this entire sub is dedicated to bch instead of btc is also really weird. Both leave a bad taste for each community. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:30:49
That's correct. This is not a pump. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:58:58
The same was said about "worthless" bitcoin not that many years ago. And it wasn't even free.

If someone forks it so it doesn't reset and it's not unlimited it could have a lot of value. Stock up now. As you said, they are literally free. 
People used to think btc had no value either. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:06:54
Just an FYI to everyone they're giving out tBTC for FREE right now, stock up while you can. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:27:07
What are the answers? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:59:06
Thanks for the very good answer! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:47:12


Can you link me that? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:14:10
That's what they used to say about btc. Look at it now though. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:18:26
It looks like that's similar to a paypal kind of thing, a private money transferring service. From what I've read that is not a crypto at all and has nothing to do with cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:18:23
They could put it into the code or something. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:04:46
It's just a number, doesn't really mean anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:39:14

I guess. Weird to say "my parents gave me 45k to gamble on bitcoin and it will now pay for my med school, so now I don't have to worry about having my parents help me with med school."
But I've got a strong suspicion this is fake anyways.

Fuck trees, we're trying to get lambos. Wrong sub, buddy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:31:25
Yeah, I think it's pretty slimy they're so intent on calling themselves bitcoin-whatever. But that's their name like some people argue and in an unregulated emerging market they have that right if they really want. What's really slimy is trying to change the name of btc to "core". That's pretty telling. Like making a fork or clone or whatever and trying to hop on the marketing bandwagon is one thing. But freaking out when someone doesn't use your name right, and then trying to change the name of your competitor at the same time, I think by just doing that you can tell they're pretty slimy about everything they're doing. Sounds very hypocritical. 
Can you give me a breakdown of the price pegging? What happened with that? Wasn't it for a pretty short period of time? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:05:25
Do they have a legal fiduciary responsibility or are you just trying to use fancy words? 
They can probably do whatever they want within reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:05:47
I don't understand. Please explain like I'm stupid? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:30:44
Just tell her it's your money and to butt out. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:36:58
I challenge you then. Link me to a source of monkeys trying to hump acorns on a trampoline? You can't. Because you've never seen it, not even in video form. Never mind live and having any real-world experience with the subject. You're just blowing smoke out of your ass and making shit up, trying to get suckers on the internet to believe you. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:33:40
Good point. 


Such as? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:15:15
If you hold off on paying rent, put it into btc, then you'll be able to just buy an apartment instead. And never pay rent.

Right now, people have decided crypto has value.

Because when you're about to go to med school and don't have money for it (needed help from his parents), you tend to have 45k laying around in "fun money" to gamble on crypto...
He didn't have a med school fund, that was the whole point of this post. He did have 45k and gambled it, and won. And now he has a med school fund.

Can you only buy btc in the Philippines with fiat? You can't get another crypto? 
Trading with btc is almost impossible right now because of the fees and wait times unless you are trading a shit ton of money.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:47:03


Lol that provided absolutely no information at all. This is exactly what I'm talking about, unless you are joking. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:13:19
Zimbabwe doesn't have a local currency, nevermind one that drops 10% a day. They abandoned it in 2009. Wtf are you talking about? 
Also, they don't use btc there. But their liquidity is terrible since Mugabe is gone and they're in a crisis about it. So they could use something like that, but without the $30 fees obviously lol. 
They wait for days to get $50 out of the bank right now (daily limit but often can't get it, even though they have money in the bank). They have ecocash and other options but the fees are too high. Many shops have 5 different pricing tiers based on how you pay for something. Cash is really hard to get ahold of there. 
A stable crypto that is easy to use with very low fees would be great for them imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:13:22
It didn't come yesterday. Do you think bitcoin is currently dead? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:02:03
What were you buying quickly in btc that was so expensive? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:06:45
To give you a better answer look up dollar cost averaging and do that. Like the other guy said, nobody can predict the future. But this helps. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:02:32
I just checked their website and I can't buy a lambo with btc. I'd buy the dollars and then trade that for a lambo.

Why? What does that mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:30:54
Lots of people do exactly that, but you still have the risk of losing your coins to the exchange if they get hacked or "hacked" or whatever. 
Depends on what kind of risk you want to take with your coins. You're right, if you want to sell quickly it's not going to be easy if you don't have some on an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:38:29
Could be. Could not be also. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:53:54
If it got multiplied by 1000 the btc market cap would be like 260 trillion dollars. That's somewhere around 4x the value of all money in the world. 
That's pretty bullish.

You spent your rent money on bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:38:27
Yeah, I've been reading through it. It looks like it's basically a paypal type of thing. It has nothing to do with crypto at all. Also looks like they're working with US dollars. You link your bank account to them and can transfer money around that way (just like paypal). It's convenient for them because nobody can get cash out of the banks to spend, even though they have money in the bank. And then they can use this paypal-like service to exchange funds with each other, rather than not being able to get cash out, or not being able to get change (and receiving gum or cigarettes as change instead). 
Pretty straightforward and is good for them. But again, has nothing to do with crypto in any way. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:02:58
Oh snap! Nobody told me she was a 10/10 hottie. Buying more now! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:50:36

You want them to announce it before they announce it? Or just to you personally?

lmfao you think almost 25% of the US population is invested in btc? And that it's an average of $1000? 
I can make up numbers too. I bet you invested 50 billion dollars and just sold to have a really nice Christmas. That would make it drop a lot. Something to think about.
