Global Intel Hub) -- 5/12/2018 -- Bitcoin is now the talk of the town (Wall St.) and yet we don't know who created it. There's lots of theories, but we haven't seen any documented evidence. Having experience in this business looking at the FX markets melt down over the last 10 years in a fraud climax, we wrote Splitting Pennies and explained the world isn't as it seems. That was before Bitcoin. Because like for any investment you want to do your due diligence, we started peeling back this onion and wanted to start from inception - and find out who created this (as just like with any investment analysis, it's another data point). What we found was astonishing - nothing! No documents, no photographs, no reports, from Satoshi. Whoever it was created a real pseudonym in order to mask their real identity. But why? Now the value of Satoshi's original coins would be in the tens of billions - why not claim them? It is our logic that it can only be someone or some group connected to the US Government, an employee perhaps - not necessarily that Bitcoin is the brainchild of the government, although that is possible as NSA has the best mathematicians in the world. We compiled this research into our leading hypothesis in an article here: EXPOSED: The real creator of Bitcoin is likely the NSA as One World Currency
Our point is not that we know 100% that this is the case, simply that it's the most plausible story, and we haven't uncovered any evidence to the contrary. Lots of people have different opinions, but they haven't produced any document proving otherwise. So we wrote the NSA and asked them, did you create Bitcoin? Hey, we are taxpayers. They work for us. Don't forget that! Their response was not surprising, they said "That's Classified" -
