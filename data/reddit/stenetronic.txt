I actually bought a miner from cointerra in November as well, they promised it would be here in March and it showed up in March, while the hash rate wasn't the 2TH promised 1.6 is pretty close and it's what everyone else got so I'm happy. Just thought I'd share that they're not a total scam, perhaps a bit dishonest.
With any investment though I consider it money lost until the return is in my hand.

That's unfortunate to hear, I still hold my Bcash from when the fork first arised. I am also subbed to r/btc. What I find though is their militant attitude is more damaging than good. From an outsiders perspective this community claims to know about the cryptosphere and does have some knowledge of how the different currencies work, then they go on to say that bitcoin is a scam. From my perspective I view them as more damaging than Jamie Dimon calling it a scam because they claim to support crypto and sprwad misinformation about bitcoin. They act as though the coins are in competition with each other, but the way I see it is the better every coin is doing the better the entire space is doing so we should be happy that people are trying to develop on different networks.

Have you considered talking to CBC about it? It sounds like a juicy story and I'm sure they would jump on it. It might not be the right move and it could backfire, but it could also work really well. My bet is they would unfreeze your account and you might have a lawyer want to take the case up for you.
Full disclosure I have a selfish desire to see this story on the news.
