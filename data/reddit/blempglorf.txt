Ken Thompson's Turing Award lecture [Reflections On Trusting Trust]( touches on this.   Hardware wallet?  Great!  But you're trusting the manufacturer.  You're also implicitly trusting the person who wrote the firmware, and the people who wrote the compiler that was used to compile said firmware.    
In the end, unless you're running code on hardware you designed yourself from the silicon level, and using a compiler you wrote yourself to compile firmware code that you wrote yourself, you're trusting someone, somewhere up the line. 
That said, hardware wallets from reputable manufacturers are probably the best you can do right now.

It was my first experience with Bitcoin, yes. 
The ability to exchange one of the world's reference currencies for bitcoin may not have been the goal of Bitcoin as a currency, but it is a practical necessity - unless you've managed to convince your employer to pay you in BTC.  My inability to make that necessary exchange without a huge amount of hassle was what led me to that conclusion.

They exist - but again, usability was a big problem.  I saw two of them yesterday.  One was in a third-rate gas station in a super sketchy neighborhood, but I couldn't get it to work well enough to complete the transaction. The other was in a vape shop sitting unplugged in the corner.  Both were charging a super-high premium (about 25%) over the rates quoted elsewhere though.
