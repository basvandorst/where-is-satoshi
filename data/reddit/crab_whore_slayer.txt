from an outsider perspective r/btc always seemed a lot more grounded and less toxic than this one. which is a shame because i'd rather invest in bitcoin than bitcoin cash until bch is more widely accepted for transactions at regular stores. i used to own some bitcoin and actually got paid in bitcoin from a client for about a year but sadly liquidated it immediately as it was my only source of income at the time. i was certainly interested in it for many years and it was pretty obvious even to an amateur in crypto that r/btc was a place to get decent information and r/bitcoin was just a censored circlejerk factory without much substance. hopefully it's gotten better since the height of btc value because this sub honestly made me lose interest in crypto at all.

this thread is always identical everytime that fight club image is used as a thumb.

well said. my evaluation may very well be off and both subs are a bit different then they were even a couple years ago. the above is just the impression i got from monitoring each and as you've said, being uninformed.

yeah valid point and I'm admittedly not very informed. I follow both of these subs just for news really. if I wanted more information I'd dig deeper. My point was about the quality of each sub having an impact on a less-informed person's interest in crypto though. r/btc became a place for people who got banned from r/bitcoin for trying to have a discussion and now their all bitcoin cash proponents posting pictures of buying a beer with it and r/Bitcoin is a bunch of standard or inverted roller coaster gifs and ironic meme's of projection like OP's here. it is what it is I guess!
