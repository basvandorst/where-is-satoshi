I saw Roger ver cry during an interview, he was talking about Bitcoins potential to save lives. I saw through the bullshit instantly. I can't believe he's behind BCH. I guarantee as soon as people find that out, they will not use BCH.

You are a God. Congratulations on being the smartest man alive.

Yeah your fee amount determines the speed of processing. If you only pay $1 with the average being above $30, you're pretty low in queue

Only a loss if you have less than $36.30, the transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:51:21
How are those transaction fees?

Bitcoin, by that time, will either be regulated into Oblivion, forked into Oblivion, hacked by quantum computers, or replaced by a superior crypto.

It's useless as anything other than a highly speculative investment right now due to $35 avg fees.

So Bitcoin is nothing but a store of value? But, I thought that value was based off it's utility. If it's useless for spending, it will lose it's value.

Possibility of US government banning Bitcoin just like China due to bank lobbyists. Do not invest into Bitcoin.
