being invloved with helping people decrypt, I have found the actual email where they got infected/encrypted, I have tried both anti-ransomwares on computers that i use for testing and then wipe them, they're both doing the job in protecting the files, but its still has a long way to go before its good for consumer use, with both, the files didn't get encrypted but the computer got messed up big time.

and ddosing nodes seems pretty deceptive to me.
goes both ways, if we behave like that, don't whine when it doesn't work out the way you wanted.
me personally am against both sides doing stuff thats not appropriate.
