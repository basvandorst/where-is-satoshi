God bless you

Sweet!  keep hodling and let the rest accumulate.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:19:05
How has that strategy worked out the last month?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:45:45
Lol We are in the same boat.  I had every intention of holding long term until the recent downtrend.  Sold to fiat for the time being and still waiting to get back in.  I understand the tax effect, but if all goes to plan, the current and hopefully future gains will far off set the tax effect thus far.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:14:41
Yes, a few days.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:50:01
So being a reddit member makes you more knowledgeable about the crypto market?  Got it........
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:31:23
Why would you assume I sold with a loss?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:44:04
So everyone who sold at 20k regrets it?  Interesting........
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:28:43
I'm sure there are plenty of us around here.  It's just laughable when the age of an account becomes the argument for why someone's opinion is disregarded.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:03:02
Sure, and they can also limit what you buy on credit too.  There's nothing wrong with this.  They aren't disallowing people from using their own money to buy crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:35:18
Haha so thats the only reason people think it's going to drop?  It can't be cause its lost more than 60% in the last month, can it?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:22:11
Why is it "likely" to not be this low again?  It was lower 6 hours ago.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:18:36
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:12:47
It's done that multple times on the way down though.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:35:06
How is it looking up?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:39:01
I agree
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:47:42
Seems to be the trend lately.  At this point, who knows though.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:17:01
Why couldn't this be true?  Just look at the front page of CMC and tell me that most of those coins are worth hundreds of millions of dollars.   
  Not to mention the new coins that sporadically pop up each and every day.  Seems pretty simple to me that the best coins will succeed, the rest will not.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:09:05
It's down more than 1k from your original post lol
edit:  I hope we all get rich from this, I just don't think we are out of this downward spiral yet.  Good times to accumulate crypto!

How has that strategy worked out the last month?
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:21:39
Besides being the first, just curious what sets Bitcoin apart from some of the quicker cheaper alt coins?  Long term, how can bitcoin compete with some of the others like Stellar, GRS, etc.?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:53:54
I'm still lost with your mentality.  I'd bet most good traders have already bought when it was lower a day or two ago and are waiting to sell shortly. You know the whole "buy low, sell high" thing.....
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:04:47
Which just shows the ignorance of people who post garbage like that.  I use this account for posting about crypto.  I'd rather not have my name associated with any posts regarding investments.
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:57:31
SDEX will have both!
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:51:41
Or maybe it will just keep going down and down and down 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:36:19
Crypto is very small compared to other markets
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:50:51
It was under 6 a day ago lol....relax buddy
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:32:41
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:10:56
huh?  It jumps up and you think it's finally over.  Just look at the chart man, how many times has it done this the past month.  You just sound completely idiotic.........
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:20:31
So it's better to sell during a huge downswing?
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:41:39
What makes you think it has bottomed?  The chart looks awful right now.  clearly everything is trending down.  I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to fall for a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:55:07
How is there no risk for the bank?  The bank is the only one with the risk in your scenario.  If someone racks up a huge amount of debt on credit and loses everything, please tell me how the bank gets their money back?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:57:54
Sure, assuming it's much higher in a year it would have been worth it to wait in that case.  But like you pointed out, those who sold and have bought back in, or are still waiting to buy back in are probably in a better situation, regardless of the tax effect (assuming the price goes back up)
Also, some people who sold at 20k might have been holding for longer than a year.
