Because every transaction on the blockchain is public and traceable, and with KYC/AML regulations and internet surveillance it is possible to link individuals' identities to specific addresses and transactions.  As a result, governments can monitor individuals' Bitcoin spending.
Some of the newer projects (Lightning, Taproot, mixers) may reduce or eliminate that traceability.  Or maybe governments will ban these projects under penalty of prison time for people who are caught running or using them.

I take it you're not [the guy he murdered]( huh.

We'll go way past 5X within two years.

For $340,000,000-ish you can buy a BIG island.

Didn't he turn out to be a murderer?
Edit: ah, yep.

By the time that happens, national fiat currencies will have been consumed already.

The only way this works is if there is a serious escrow service as a middleman.  By "serious", I mean one that doesn't fuck over sellers every single time like PayPal does, but also one that gives reasonable protections to buyers so that when they get a broken robotic dog they can get a refund.

Thanks!  Perfect, this should work fine then.
The symbolic-link thing is probably the fastest for me.  That should free up juuuuuust enough space (~3gb) to let me finish sync'ing.  I'm at 98.95% with a little under 200 megabytes of space left, and bitcoin-qt is spitting out "Error: Error: Disk space is low!" messages. :-/

There was a post here a few years ago by some guy asking how to break into his friend's computer to steal his bitcoins.

The fees were high because of dust transaction attacks and miners intentionally mining empty blocks, both done to try to disrupt Bitcoin (almost certainly in a vain attempt to get people to use BCash instead).  The miners who did that burned up a lot of money.
SegWit reduces the size of on-chain transactions, and Lightning reduces the need for on-chain transactions.  These will help to make those sorts of attacks a lot more painful for anyone trying to pull that stuff again.

You'll be crying too as all those hedge funds have to cash out their Bitcoin to cover their losses on their other investments, and Bitcoin's price drops.

Magic Chicken-Entrails-Ball says "outlook unclear".
But it's looking like a blowoff top.  Started seeing sharp spikes up and down in price.  I'm gonna guess it will stabilize around $6300.

At what price did you buy BTC?
If it was at $20K, you'd spend more money on fixing the phone than you'd recover.
If you bought some guy a couple of pizzas in 2010 and stored the Bitcoin that he sent you on your phone, then it's time to call an electronics repair service. . . .

I too take hormone injections (insulin) and identify as a nondiabetic.  Still can't eat rice without my blood glucose making like the Bitcoin chart for the last couple days. :-(
Congrats on the boobies.  I hope you bought in again and end up a multimillionaire.

Who's banning it?  Don't throw me in that briar patch, Br'er Fox!
