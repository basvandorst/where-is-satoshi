@_date: 2017-12-22 07:34:32

@_date: 2017-12-20 10:12:02

I meant cents, sorry. 
When you are talking about a fee, I take it to mean "a payment made to a professional person or to a professional or public body in exchange for advice or services." I don't really see doing the small POW in IOTA as a fee. Do you consider the electricity used to run your refrigerator every minute a fee?
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:57:56
Are you implying that the 1/10000 of electricity and your 7 dollar average transaction are comparable at all?

Remember kids, if you don't like something - just call it a scam.

There has been research done that says the DCA yields a LOWER amount of money on average than lump sum investments.

If he spent 4000 in 2010 he would have a lot more than 2000 bitcoin depending on when he bought it. It was around 8 cents in July 2010. Idk sounds like a larp because I've heard so many of these stories before.

Sign a btc message. I don't believe you.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:47:57
I agree but it has been proven that DCA is inferior to a one time lump sum payment in nearly all markets over a long sample size. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:18:03
I don't believe this. Back then it was nearly impossible to buy bitcoin and nobody knew where it was heading. There were no exchanges. Also, your math is way off. 2M bitcoin ahhahaha
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:14:40
what exchange lets you to jump the order book that much?
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:08:54
Agreed - and to hold it through all the BS until today? Most of the 2009/2010 miners and investors sold before today. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:25:57
Please start day trading and let us know over a large sample size how you are doing. Anyone can get good results with a non-deterministic sample size.

Coinbase buy or sell price?
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:09:22
Already hit 5150
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:39:55
Usually there's a couple % spread when you alternate between the two on coinbase (I guess fees or something)

I transferred from Gatehub -&gt; Poloniex.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:15:51
But seriously, why 5+ hours? And will transaction times get larger and larger? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:41:13
Couldn't find it either, which is why it is so weird.
