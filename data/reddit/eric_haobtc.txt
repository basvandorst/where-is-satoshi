@_date: 2016-08-13 08:50:27
Did he mean Blockstream? Or other companies? Need more context.
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:03:03
Nothing is clear at this stage. All based on zane tacket's statement, which is vague and subject to interpretation; given that he lives in Amsterdam while the company's main operation is based in HK, the communication btw them may not be very effective. Won't be surprised if ZT backtrack

Right, seems the misconception that Bitcoin is run by a company is quite prevalent - heard the OneCoin guy saying the same on Bitcoin Uncensored.

I was told by the author that the print one will be out tomorrow or Friday. The online version a few days later. Will grab a copy and post a scan somewhere.

The first one talked about Localbitcoins and OTC trading. The second talked about basics about Bitcoin.

HaoBTC, you get a off-chain wallet plus interest income
@_date: 2015-06-22 04:40:37
We are making money at the current price range. We actually don't want the price to be too high - the difficulty level can go through the roof.
@_date: 2015-06-21 14:24:53
BTC only
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:13:05
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:12:14
You are right. The amount of power passing thru is so much that regular wire get hot and melt quickly.
@_date: 2015-06-05 03:31:24
The headline is a little misleading - we are close to Tibet, but not in Tibet per se.
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:10:58

Suggest those that don't, then I will delete them.
@_date: 2015-06-21 14:27:18
We own other miners including over 10,000 S3. The daily output is around 100 BTC at the moment.
@_date: 2015-05-19 11:17:20


The risk of being stricken by a major earthquake is pretty low compared with BTC price going down below our breakeven point or the Chinese government slapping another ban.
@_date: 2015-05-19 10:58:27
Wow, didn't realize that our mine is generating big buzz.

@_date: 2015-05-29 02:52:36
Good to hear.

I worked at this company for two months. Among the few times that I was in close distance with Star Xu there was a meeting when he talked about hiring a CFO. He described the ideal candidate as either an investment banker or an Ivy League graduate, stressing that this person must bring reputation to OKCoin. This gives me ample reason to suspect that CZ was hired not for his coding skill but for the prestige of his previous employers and OKCoin might be complicit in hyping up CZ’s credentials for its marketing value, until it decided that it wasn’t enough to justify the paycheck. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 10:59:30
Lol. How will they beat us? With their BTC mining toasters? 
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:15:36
they banned banks from working with bitcoin companies.
they also banned taobao vendors from selling bitcoins
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:32:42


The only reasonable explanation is that Star Xu wanted an empty suit who knows how to schmooze Westerners and impress domestic users. Until he learned all his tricks and found a cheaper alternative.
@_date: 2016-01-22 05:49:19
Not us. We are too invested in the future of Bitcoin. While short-term interest is important, success of our growth strategy relies on how prosperous Bitcoin ecosystem will be in ten years. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:13:42
Both sides bring too much unrelated stuff into this argument. Whether CZ lied about his credential should be treated a separate issue, and OKCoin may have itself to blame for not having done proper due diligence - it doesn't paint itself good hiring someone incompetent and took so long to figure out. The issue at hand is whether OKCoin lied to the public, including users and ppl like Stefan Thomas. Well it did - OKCoin doesn't deny that it reneged on the donation promise. And it is clear that the CTO didn't have the power to make the CEO to do the honorable thing and that the company is basicly under by one person's whims. This is very alarming and 100 times more serious than someone exaggerated his resume to get a USD 300,000 per year package and whatever else. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 15:54:54

Cuz chinese ppl r fanatic like nobody else. I am speaking for myself.
@_date: 2016-06-01 07:19:01
Sure. Mr. Wu identified an address - possibly linked to a pyramid scheme and observed that about 100 mln yuan worth of bitcoins were bought from the market and went to the same address for four consecutive days.
@_date: 2016-06-03 06:06:55
You should try haobtc some day
