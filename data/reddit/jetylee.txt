You created a new ticket right?  They reply like twice a month
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:02:01
I have a lot of BTC from 2011/2012   Never really “earned it though”
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:05:58
Good to know.  Thank you.  I may try some of my simple ones. The other user mentioned something about automatic suspension. Heard of that?  
Their ticket replies literally take weeks. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:06:02
The last time the govt shutdown and BTC rose 800% there was no HFT for BTC.  
HFT using real protocols like FIX only debuted in 2015.

I had a support ticket with them...(and still do)  they were the ones that found my Wallet ID, reset my 2fa, and I'm now asking about the password.
Is it possible I'm suspended and don't realize it?  How can I confirm?  
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:30:34
I hear ya... changing accounts, moving securities "the old way" is actually still "the normal way." 
We just don't realize it anymore... we use High Frequency Trading all day every day.
In all reality, it's still paper.  That's why the T+3 Settlements still exit.

You didn't know how a holding company works prior to buying into the IPO?
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:01:29
I’ll google.  Thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:03:46
wtf is your problem?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:08:19
oh... wrong reddit.. I see.. thanks for REAL info... my mistake.
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:33:42
I’ve been verified forever, I don’t see the issue.  
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:09:57
Oh well, if HE says so, I’m all in now!
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:34:48
Also uphold.com lets you go straight fiat to alts.

Coinbase is far from the 'Largest Bitcoin Exchange"
In fact, I'm not so sure what I just even read here.
@_date: 2019-06-14 14:44:24
LOL: You’re trading BTC on Exchange Software and Order Matching Engines invented by Old People in the early 90s.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:55:15
Did that in the past.  It takes two weeks to disable or enable. 
And if you attempt in between the two weeks the timer starts over.  
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:48:39
that's even worse LOL.  at one point the balance was probably double... they should have stolen it and claimed the BCH
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:10:59
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:50:48
FYI anyone who thinks I’m crazy... isn’t it far better to donate to an “ethical hacker” as opposed to leaving the currency unavailable to the world for eternity?
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:31:52
Early 80s actually.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:50:38
No. sorry
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:20:35
Pointless. Maybe some genius knows how to hack it.  Getting in legit proves fruitless. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:16:11
I do have Discord installed now. "HottWeelz"
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:56:18
Two weeks to disable anyway.  Did it by trying different emails thinking that was an issue. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:10:45
maybe 'Dakota99' capital D.  which was rare... add an exclamation point on the end for extreme requirements.
BCHain.info has little to no requirements though.
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:04:34
awesome... I also tried decoding and encoding my password on those sites that offer encoding.... (thinking blockchain.info bug), but that wasn't working out either
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:00:27
I'd hate to say it, but you know how "people" are with passwords...
Dakota99 was my project vehicle during those years... my passwords are my project vehicle.
No I don't have the 1999 Dodge Dakota RT any longer ;)
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:51:12
Yes 
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:39:58
Sorry guys, I'm clicking  "Accept" as the emails come in, we are at the mercy of Gmail latency, and my timeliness.
The Wallet Identifier is 
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:43:08
that's been lost for years :(
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:11:00
Could be the case as well.  We were using login names like “hottweelz” and the new wallet ID was with a change they made 
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:00:38
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:47:44
I honestly feel like it's an issue on the Blockchain.info side... support isn't answering my emails.  
If someone wanted to STEAL it.. they should've by now, when it was worth like $60
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:07:19
think I granted it.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:41:38
And no, back in 2012 when I first signed up, I seem to have lost the 12 word identifier.
Blockchain.info was a lot worse back then too... I was a newb, didn't know much, password requirements (i believe to this day) are literally silly.
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:08:50
I’ll recheck 
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:06:05
I've long since learned many lessons in the years.  
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:39:51
even if someone gets to successfully login to blockchain.info?
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:46:18
I honestly believe the error message reflects a blockchain.info issue
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:04:35
You couldn't handle volatile trading, it's ok... not built for everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:44:52
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:12:30
sure, I don't have Discord installed here, but send me a link
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:16:57
All I get is "Error Decrypting Wallet"
I know it's NOT a lot of money, but I'm beyond frustrated since 2013.  There's also a BCH fork waiting for you if you get access.
I was never meant to own this :(
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:43:41
;)  you're good at researching,, but still no good for Blockchain :(
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:34:36

@_date: 2018-02-25 01:19:20
I will click “accept” on every email attempt I get.   
It’s yours for the taking.  
Password should be “dakota99”
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:45:40
Then they have more power than I've had all these years.
