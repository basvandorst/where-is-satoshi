Yes, I suppose the only difference is that cryptocurrencies are only scarce because they're not widespread enough.  Physical things will naturally limit speculation, until people start imposing value by fiat rules on it.
Bitcoin isn't "scarce" ... is it?  What's the smallest possible amount of tradeable bitcoin?
What's to stop a greedy financial entity from simply sponsoring a new crypocurrency to debase once trust in bitcoin is bled dry?
Also, lets not discount more malicious motives, such as economic warfare.  "If you want to destroy capitalism, debase the currency."

In economics, I guess, the ultimate currency is trust in commodity.  The Bitcoin Cash thing is pretty troubling;  if cryptocurrencies become more widespread it becomes just another extension of the media war.
Thanks for all that, by the way, very interesting stuff.

Shrug, until they start punishing naked greed with a suitable sentences, there's very little incentive to come up with fraudulent schemes.
I wonder how much of the Dodd-Frank act is left.

The loans had very little direct effect on the subprime crisis, other than that they were there.  It was the exponential growth of default swaps and associated CDOs that ballooned the subprime crisis into a huge global recession.
Currency speculation fraud *is a thing*.  There was already one t major scandal  but it was more about manipulating prices rather than outright creating money out of thin air and giving it the veneer of stability with fraudulent credit ratings.
I'm asking, is it possible that big finance is artificially generating value, not only by inflating BTC, but shady financial instruments involving it?
