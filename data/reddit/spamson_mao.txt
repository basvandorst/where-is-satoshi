Right? UASDF? Not much bets, so it's all good, even *overwhelmingly* good, right? *Overwhelming* lack of a negative market reaction. So let's just do this motherfucking fork, what are we waiting for!

Whateva, just buy our coin and dump theirs and we're good. Just don't tell us how to do the pump, we know our shit. OK? Don't rock the boat.
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:12:42
OK, you convinced me. Maybe it is not so easy to catch by plebs. Keep saying that we have 30% support for now.


Thats cool, I don't insist paying you.

Yeh sure dude... 
But but... we politicians are more important than the markets!!! We know better, right?
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:34:38


Those 30% signalling for *SegWit* are gonna build on top of the 70% not signalling for *SegWit*, so they wouldn't be mining BIP148 either. This exposes that no one would. You are not worthy of pumping BIP148 coin.

You are not sticking to the plan. You are telling people not to sell - that's being bullish. Think of all the privileges you get for being part of the team. Do you want to lose them?

One more proof that the people of the highest socialist moral standards stand with the USSF. People who know best what to do with other people's money, even better than those other people. Experts. This is no surprise, of course. The BEEP148 USSF itself is flawlessly designed by experts to institute radical equality! It is one of the most genius feats of collectivism and proletarian egalitarianism since the Great Leap Forward!

Whatever you do, beware of 'smart contracts'! It may not be so smart.

Comrade would love this idea. Maybe he can back you up.

THE MASSES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CAPITAL. This is the truth we live by in communism. You've well stated that old truth in the context of cryptocommunism, which we are the champions of. Our USSF movement is the logical extension of the Communist Revolution in cyberspace, through the use of cryptology. The future of cryptocurrency belongs to us!

Exactly, comrade. BIP148 enables a greatly progressive collectivization program which our Bitcoin community needs right now. At once it will help proletarians and punish the evil capitalist Bitcoin proprietors. It also leads to kicking out the capitalist miners usurping the means of production. But you need to run a BIP148 node and do SegWit transactions on it after activation so that you can take part in the great collectivization and redistribution that experts in economics agree will lead to a lot of equality!
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:26:00
That's the spirit, comrade! All those miners who lay their fat capitalist hands on the means of production - the mining equipment? Let us deprive them of it! Block production will be in the hands of the proletariat once again! Everyone will be able to produce blocks! Forward, comrades!
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:00:59
This a revolution against the decadent miners usurping the means of production! Have no mercy for the bourgeoisie miners who tell you that only they can produce Bitcoin blocks! Together we will build a progressive Bitcoin community where every bitcoiner and every node is equal! Join us, the proletarian users, and be part of the revolution! The future belongs to us!
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:59:21
Let us have a socialist brotherhood of cryptocurrencies! Bitcoin, Litecoin, Vertcoin, together!
**Shitcoin pumpers of the world, unite!**
For a progressive, equal and proletarian future!

BitcoinReminder_com you are being insubordinate posting this which did not go through our channels! Did you forget what BIP148 is all about? You've created a mess! Can I not have at least a two day vacation without one of you screwing up?!

Indeed, comrade Amir Taaki fought for [People's Protection Units]( the armed wing of the Kurdish leftist [Democratic Union Party]( a member of the [Socialist International]( Here's a source: 
Unsurprisingly, as a good comrade, comrade Amir was also progressive enough to realize that the BIP148 UASF cause, our extension of the Communist Revolution into the Bitcoin community, is the right cause to fight for. We shall take the means of production from the fat hands of the capitalist pig miners! Forward, comrades!

It is not a scam, I assure you. You just misunderstand communism and collectivism. Your money has just been collectivized for the public good. This is exactly what the majority (and therefore you) want, anyway.
