We Brits would almost certainly let them, if they got all the right permits. We LOVE small high-tech firms in our country, suits the demographic.

Can I just ask the Russians or Trump to put my payment in with theirs? I feel like having more than a few donors would get complicated.

Or a large portion of people agree that society is better with certain things not being purchasable. 
I literally can't think of anything I couldn't buy that possession of which would be legal. I can think of plenty of things I can buy that are illegal to own though, at least in combinations that are easy enough. Outlawed firearms, drugs, illegal pornography, hitmen, criminals for hire... That's a reasonable list of things that I can't buy because ownership of them is illegal. The method by which I buy these things is irrelevant. Just in case you read this bit wrong, I don't mean that's all you can use bitcoin for, I'm saying that's all I can't use fiat currency for. 
 If it isn't allowed by the government, that is because society at large has agreed that we are better off without those things in circulation. If you have issue with that, bitcoin isn't going to help you. Political pressure might, moving might, but BTC isn't suddenly going to allow you to defy the government in some way without the usual punishment. 
It's the people like you who keep saying these literally absurd things about BTC that keep people out. People read that, and anyone reasonable sits there and thinks exactly what the people in this thread have: "That's not true though. I can buy whatever I want. The only things I can't buy I have already tacitly agreed that society doesn't need by accepting the gov't.".

I'm not American. 
Just because I have a different view to you doesn't mean I'm stupid, if you disagree with me so much, and certainly if you think you're so enlightened, then back up your point in some way. 
If you have issue with my bitcoin point, then say it. While I didn't back up my wikileaks joke with a source, as that's all it was meant to be, there have been some fairly public claims recently that I assume you're acquainted with. If you have issue with them, then source it, or ask for mine, don't just make some ham-fisted attempt to act smart while actually responding like a child: with a personal attack and no facts.

Just asked my average-joe tech girlfriend if she could do any of this, she wouldn't know where to start on ANY of that. 
I tried in freshman year (2 years ago) and literally COULDN'T get any, I tried for nearly 3 months and just couldn't find any way of getting some in the UK short of Western Union transferring money to a site in the US where I could get the guy to send me back bitcoins. 
I totally agree with OP, getting bitcoins can be a joke. I'm supposedly a reasonably smart guy, I teach programming and robotics, and study a masters at a tech university and it was still impractically hard..

Oh investment, you tricky mistress

That's much better, but I have less time on my hands now, and to be honest, I was really put off by how hard the process was before. I like the idea of BTC, and follow the news, but my interest in investing is basically gone. 
If people want widespread acceptance it has to be easy, we're not going to change the world, the general public is, and if my GF and I can't work it out quickly Joe Average certainly can't, and that's going to cripple BTC unless it's fixed.

Ouch, that's even worse than my $50...
