What. The. Fuck. 
Great. Now I can't use that as the name of my Cult's cryptocurrency.

Not really. 
Foreign embassy visit, full in a form,  assure them you won't end up stateless as a result, you sign, they cancel your passport with a special stamp stating you've expatriated yourself.  
In 2013, approximately 10k newly ex-Americans did so.

I [mull]( all the time. 
I get nothing or of it except a buzzed feeling and a bit of a hangover, though....

..which really makes me wonder about things like what should have been my *cult's* cryptocurrency,  Aphroditecoin, that Cyprus is allegedly launching.

OHM2013 last year in the Netherlands accepted BTC for registration. (And gods do I wish I paid that way, if only because it would've been a hell of a lot simpler and cheaper in the end than even the wire transfer ended up being. Absolute clusterjob that. Still an awesome con. Highly recommend going to the next Dutch con in four years or Chaos Computer Camp next year in Germany if you are able to.) 
As far as I'm aware, it's the first stateside conference to accept BTC. 
During early reg, though, you read the posts on how fast those tix sold out?! I wanted to get one, and despite a fibre link for the hardline (the bosses would be so angry with me if they knew what I was doing!), a 4G LTE connection for the mobile, I *still* wasn't able to punch through!

I'm somewhat skilled at bureaucratic navigation,  so it seems simpler for me I'll concede. 
Only other option would be getting Congress to change the tax code, but as passport wielding expats are an unrepresented constituency. ..

China wants to keep capital locked up domestically as much as possible,  and to import foreign capital as easily add possible.

But that would require actual work instead of supposition and innuendo. 
Lazy journos hate real work.

Well,  if you are going out if your way to give up US citizenship, the UN Convention on Reducing Statelessness,  which the US is a party to, kicks in. There are some proud ex-Americans who showed their docs on Twitter. One is in Berlin, form stated that she would obtain ein reichpass upon completion, as Germany doesn't permit dual nationality. Many nations do, US does in limited circumstances like mine as all mine were obtained via birth.) 
So kwitcherbitchin' about taxes, you probably will end up paying something somewhere.  Unless, of course, you are really good at hiding financial transactions from state actors with motivation and resources to discover them.
