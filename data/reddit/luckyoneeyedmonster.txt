Man if someone follows me home then breaks into my house just to get at my bitcoin...well there are things worth a lot more than my bitcoin to steal there. Also good luck pulling all that off. Thats not going to end well for them. That's about as stupid as one can be.

You can say words, true, but they make little sense in that order.

Well then you must know everything. 
Or nothing. Not sure which. In any case, this account is new but I am not. Stop it with weak ass arguments. 
To quote another... 
Read the actual Hong Kong agreement: 
"We understand that SegWit continues to be developed actively as a soft-fork and is likely to proceed towards release over the next two months, as originally scheduled.
The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit."
Was SegWit a viable option in 2013?

Dude what the holy fuck? You are focused on a link accidentally pasted to far, out of all it that? I fixed it for you, your royal heinous.  
And further that's exactly my damn point. SegWit wasn't a thing when you discuss your hard fork in 2013. It is now. And it's the best option by far.

Try quadrigcx? Localbitcoins? Gemini?

You're completely out to lunch dude. I think you should stop posting utter bullshit and do some proper research first. Wow.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:35:08
Quadrigacx works...

On your dashboard just click "CAD/ETH", then in the "Available Ether" box click "Fund"...
