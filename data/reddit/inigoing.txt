yo bro, if you are looking for some work, do let me know. I think we can team up, I am running a crypto media agency that helps in marketing decent projects industry. Hit me up, if you are keen.
@_date: 2019-03-13 15:46:55
Seriously the most irritating thing bout BTC for me.
@_date: 2019-11-21 14:11:46
Only if you and every holder out there chooses to sell at 100k
@_date: 2019-11-08 08:07:35
What wallet or platform is this?
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:34:35
I have seen this before....
@_date: 2019-03-13 15:46:16
The real truth lol
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:24:03
Lolx just buy some now.... Check out remitano or local bitcoins. It helps if you tell us where you are from so we can advice relevant P2P sites or so
@_date: 2019-11-08 08:12:56
I guess you can contact support directly to find out or alternatively send a sat or two just to confirm
@_date: 2019-11-21 14:09:12
I hope soooo
@_date: 2019-03-15 07:35:13
Lolx preach it
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:56:26
Yeah but I get no karma for voicing it nor does anyone scream manipulation.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:56:44
Hey hey hey
@_date: 2019-12-23 18:28:10
Mainly cause it's easy.... Easy to lose my BTC to the custodians...
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:34:42
I hope it's a world where a sat will get you very far. 
@_date: 2019-04-16 05:09:43
BCH Next?
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:37:15
And they say fees are high....
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:36:37
You could do a local meet up with local btc if that helps. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:25:30
This isn't the way we treat brothers even misguided ones. We have to be better. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:26:40
Same here. So tempting tho. Can't wait for some of that JOMO
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:28:21
That's good advice but isn't the idea to have BTC is to not use those systems any longer. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 12:13:26
Lolx story of Vitalik's life
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:40:21
Bcash keeps shutting on lightning network, centralisation and high fees. Tbh the fud is getting to me. Any words of encouragement?
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:21:50
Thank you for your knowledge. If it weren't for people like you, layman like me will be lost in the dusk....xp
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:36:54
Lolx sounds like what happens to me but at bars.
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:35:55
Lolx for someone who is barely a shrimp in this BTC hodl. You are pretty good up. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 07:25:58
I must be an idiot cause I don't get it.....
@_date: 2019-04-07 12:14:02
I was semi trolling their sub with news of btc
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:43:10
Use groups in telegram but be very very careful. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:41:58
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:22:09
More like down vote this shit cause it has nothing to do with BTC or crypto. 
Thanks Craig but we ain't falling for your shit anymore.....xp
@_date: 2019-04-07 12:14:53
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:04:26
Thank you for the info, you have no idea how much this helps. Gonna buy another bag of btc lol.
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:35:50
It really grinds my gears tho. Sigh.
@_date: 2019-04-15 03:51:01
How can I look into hiring professionals over there for jobs? Any advice? Pointers and contacts
@_date: 2019-04-09 04:50:24
Amen brother. The future awaits.
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:58:53
