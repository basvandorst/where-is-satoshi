Can we just make a r/cryptonumberplates?

They definitely should have kept working and got a few more miners and, like you said, payed in fiat.
I'm thinking of getting in on mining, just because graphics cards will hold their value at least somewhat, and I can leave it mining and get bitcoins during winter, then game during the other seasons. Definitely not going to stop what I've been doing to make money though, it's stupid to have one source of income.

Even if that went smooth they would only make like 20 bucks a day... why did the think that??

Fuck you, take my upvote.
@_date: 2019-03-22 10:48:15
That's a completely different set of math tho.
@_date: 2019-03-22 10:52:23
What does that have to do with how many bitcoins everyone would have if they were equally distributed?

But wouldn't Bitcoin would be bad for the US government? It's not really a taxable asset.

Satoshis are just fractions of Bitcoin, I think it's 0.00000001btc.

Is this better or worse than a juul?
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:02:31
Well I actually told my dad about it and he conveyed it to her, somehow not mentioning the point that crypto is highly volatile and you should wait for it to drop before investing(that I of course told him). 
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:28:53
I told my aunt to invest in ethereum and she waited until it hit 1k to invest... Should bought the dip.
@_date: 2018-07-30 05:47:45
I am also curious about that!

But I only have 0.0004 BTC, and it's in my unpaid nicehash balance. :(

They're getting cheaper. Most houses in my neighborhood are running solar, and most are running 2kW+. The only problem is startup costs.
