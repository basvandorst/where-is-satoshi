Although I have no idea and can't seem to work out how to transfer that into my multibit wallet :(

Thanks for the message, to be honest I just want to buy 1 bitcoin and see what happens from there so I apologise for wasting your time a little, the more I look into it, it all seems a little bit daunting. My girlfriend and father seem to be complete non-believers of bitcoin so I'm looking at it as a bit of an experiment for now, and I would really like to prove them wrong haha.

haha thank you, so you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin straight away?
EDIT: OH SHIT! thanks man, took me a while to figure out what that was haha, thank you so much!!! Good luck in all you future BitCoin investments, cheers man!

So I'm guessing you would fully recommend Mt.Gox? Seems to be by far the most popular. Just one more question, how long did it take from signing up to obtaining your first bitcoin, assuming you bought at least one straight away?

haha the guy is sitting on $300,000 now, you can't really argue with that

Thanks, any recommendations that are slightly more anonymous?  I've heard Bit Innovate is a good one for Australians but you have to deposit the money in the actual bank (like walk and make a cash deposit) and then I read that they have to receive the money within 4 hours of your order which just confuses me. Any suggestions that are a little faster, use paypal?

I'm going to imagine every ELI5 post being explained by that TV presenter from now on. Great interview, and yes just scratching the surface!
