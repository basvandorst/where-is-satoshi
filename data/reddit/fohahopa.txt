Segwit2x was cancelled one week ago. I doubt someone going to mine Segwit2x chain, or trade it. 


There is no replay protection. So you would need to send your old BTC coins together with BTC originating from coinbase coins generated after block 494783 - only then it would make such BTC transaction invalid on Segwit2x chain, so you could use your Segwit2x coins anytime in future (because new BTC coins, 12.5 BTC+fees, created after block 494783 are invalid on Segwit2x chain). But I doubt Segwit2x going to be mined or traded.

Your free to run Bitcoin incopatible node in November, but whats the point if no new blocks are generated for your node anymore ? Do the developers you follow plan to make the abandoned chain functional, like PoW hardfork to a new coin ?

While I agree with you, Bitcoin Cash added EDA to the consensus rules, which is the only difference from first Satoshi client consensus rules. The curiosity is, because of this emergency difficulty adjustement, Bitcoin Cash has longest chain in the sence of number of blocks, though longest proof of work chain which is sum of block difficulties has Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:26:38
Bitcoin is the one with most proof of work chain, Winkies ETF tried to address this already. BCH cannot apply anymore because this chain changed difficulty adjustment rules and can not be compatible with first Satoshi client without changing its consensus rules.

Show better solutions then. Already working ones, not just promises and theoretical solutions. You act like a politician, I guess the CEOs are already sick of your promises and fairytales - they need working solutions now, and 2x increase is one for now.
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:25:56
While I agree with what you said above, you should preffer a constructive dialog with the NYA signers. As you wrote, to work together and scale - it should be dialogue, not Core monologue, because the CEOs have needs for their business to work as well.
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:06:04
True, its called SegWit2x locked already a while ago at bit 4. I dont understand the fuss around SegWit2x, or are there really people wanting to deactivate SegWit2x ??? It would be a complete mess...
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:22:13
With such miner support, I doubt there going to be two working chains. Plus I guess another warning going to be around to stop making transactions until the situation is clear, like on Aug 1.
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:33:00
Your despotism is clear, but the reality is: some Bitcoin users support SegWit2x, and some dont.
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:52:49
There are different Bitcoin softwares though. For some Bitcoin software 2x is required (like btc1), for some it is invalid (like Core) and others dont care and just check most proof of work (like BU).
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:59:42
Your wrong with so many points, I doubt anybody going to take you seriously at coinbase. For example:
- Bitcoin developers dont need to contribute to Bitcoin Core, it is just one of many Bitcoin implementations
- BCH was not created by NYA signers. You cant prevent forks. Everyone is free to create one, and this one comes from those who dont like the idea of compromise. Another fork going to come from those who religiously believe in 1MB and do not like the idea of compromise eighter, obviousy they are minority thus hardfork to modify Bitcoin mining algo is needed for their chain to work - they are the ones who need to add replay protection. Thats why two forks are inevitable, Bcash and Bcore (or Blegacy as you preffer, we shall see)
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:45:46
But how many hashrate percentage reject 2x? Maybe few percent, which is not enought for the old chain to keep the Bitcoin name - because it would not work well if Bitcoin users could get only few blocks everyday for months.
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:06:41
Seems many still dont understand why the financial intentives is the reason why Satoshi proof of work concept works.
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:28:09
Miners going to mine on more profitable chain. Not only does it make sense, some NYA miners already annouced it. So the chain which market preffers matters.
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:18:18
Your wrong, SegWit2x locked already a while ago at bit 4. SegWit2x is a compromise that was agreed on, at least by most Bitcoin economy which is what matters.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:20:47
I dont think the point of NYA is force Core to do something, but more like ignore Core and do whatever is best for Bitcoin. And if Bitcoin is really decentralized, one dev team cannot veto a change NYA economic majority want.
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:22:53
Maybe because its much easier to implement 2x to their software than SegWit.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:33:12
After very similar Xapo statement, I guess it is becoming market standart. And thankfully reasonable one, Bitcoin (BTC) as the chain with highest support, thus price, thus accumulated difficulty is much better than having authority who decides what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:14:55
Stop talking the propaganda. There are Bitcoin clients which are SegWit2x compatible. For many Bitcoin software SegWit2x is just soft fork, like my old BU wallet which I downloaded even before NYA/SegWit2x existed. Talking about 2x as altcoin is ridicilous.
You guys miss one thing, Bitcoin Core is just one of many Bitcoin implementations. The sonner you realize it, the sonner you understand what decentralization really mean, and even with losing one or more implementations, Bitcoin going to continue thanks to its implementation decentralization.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:27:14


door to further contentious changes in the future.
The change to both SegWit and 2x took so long and both got so much resistance, it going to be very hard to make any such big future change most Bitcoin economy would agree with again.
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:28:31
I do. It didnt took long to prove you wrong though.
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:41:07
I thought Satoshi solved it long time ago - Bitcoin is the chain with most proof of work.
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:55:14
I dont follow development situation unfortunatelly, because my BU wallet works well. I cant have SegWit addresses though, but not big deal so far with my few txs monthly. All I know is they doing some gigabit initiative to test how big blocks can personal computers with normal internet connection handle - usefull to know for Bitcoin, dont you think?
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:22:24
What a irony in the title, ETH is a ICO.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:40:05
It was 24 blocks reorg during the hardfork incident with new Bitcoin-qt client update from BerkeleyDB to the LevelDB in 2013.
My bad I remembered the blocks orphaned as about 40, when in fact it was 6 hours of mining and 24 blocks orphaned.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:38:37
There is no athority to define what Bitcoin consensus rules are. Its all the different Bitcoin softwares in use who define what Bitcoin is, and not everyone uses the core 1M rule anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:19:53
Obviously most cumulated hashrate, aka most Proof of Work, aka  sum of all block difficulties. While Bitcoin Cash had more hashrate few times, it never got most cumulated hashrate as can be seen from the graph:
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:01:13
For my BU node the 2x part is a soft fork as well. Its hard fork only for some Bitcoin software. What matter in decentralization is at least some Bitcoin software still following the Bitcoin chain, so it doesnt matter if some nodes stop working. Anyway, Im ready to follow Bitcoin chain with my BU node, no matter what happens.
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:11:18
There is some user support for SegWit2x and from bitcoin meetups I know its not tiny minority, though its not majority either. Majority simply dont care, they are mostly concerned about price. So saying majority want keep the base blocksize 1M is not true either.
Takeover ? Do you imply Bitcoin is already in control by somebody??? I know it is not, thats why no takeover can ever be made.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:42:12
Being the one who bought at ATH is not funny buddy. The point is buying Bitcoin at dips...
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:00:08
I realize there are currently in use many different Bitcoin software handling the blocksize differently. Because of decentralization, there is no Bitcoin authority who define the blocksize, thus only market can decide in principle.
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:42:45
Obviously not for my node, it is compatible already and existed before any NYA/SegWit2x agreement. Whether 2x is soft fork or hard fork, it is just question of what Bitcoin software you using.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:58:06
Which follows the most hashrate. Which mean Slush is wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:34:49
Define valid then. A lot of different Bitcoin softwares in use currently. Even the first Satoshi client considered blocks over 1M valid.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:28:00
You got it wrong, they call a minority chain a fork.
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:46:13
Not every node is economically equeal. Bitcoin is mean to be decentralized, so lets the market decide in November. Your appeal to authority thorough your post suggests your not really sure market is on 1x side as you say, thats all I get from your post.
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:03:15
It is impossible in decentralized environment for all the nodes to have the same consensus rules. But at the end every node going to follow its preffered chain.
And no, number of nodes does not matter much, what really matter is the economy behind the nodes (so for example my node is basically worthless compared to any popular service node).
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:36:20
Lol, so hard to write in in term of services: Bitcoin (BTC) is meant the chain with most PoW with blocksize up to 2M (blockweight up to 8M) ?
Actually selling the abandoned chain with old 1M consensus rules and not much new blocks anymore might be considered fraud instead - it wont be useable coin.
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:46:59
Actually I welcome such experiment with this new coin changing PoW and keeping limited blockchain space. If limited blockchain space become such thing in future as few people says, then this experiment might be succesfull regardless of losing Bitcoin name. So maybe one day I going to believe and start using such coin if it proves me wrong by such real world experiment excelling over bigger blockchains in its useability - but not sonner.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:00:15
It is like with any other Bitcoin purchase, first check whether other users had any issues with the service you willing to use.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:56:46
Sign the tx offline, and hand write the sending tx to other online computer. Do not ever connect the computer you signed the tx with until you get many confirmations...
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:54:54
Bitcoin is the chain with most proof of work. All you need to determine what Bitcoin is for example a BU node. The companies would mislead their users if they continued calling Bitcoin the abandoned chain or chain with not most proof of work. I Hope luke-jr dont mind I using different Bitcoin software than he is contributing to.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:52:29
There is no authority who can define what is a Bitcoin. Thats why Xapo neutrality + let the market decide is fair approach.
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:06:36
If you talking about coup attempts you assume Bitcoin is already under some control. Boo
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:32:47
The biggest reorg in Bitcoin so far is about 40 blocks. I doubt 1000 block reorg is realistical. Anyway, it is the way how Bitcoin works, Bitcoin is the chain with most PoW
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:28:50
But 2x is completly compatible with consensus rules of many Bitcoin software currently used. Not to mention consensus rules of the first Satoshi client, thus no doubt it can be named Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:03:24
So now dictators going to define what the "will of the community is". Boo.
The hashrate follow chain price, thus hashrate  is representative of the will of the community. Beware of tyrans who claim they have to fix bad market results with their own definitions ! 
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:07:39
Your wrong, Bitcoin whitepaper does not define block sizes. Actually first Satoshi client did not restrict block size so it could be up to the defined message size, 32M. Perfectly compatible with blocksize up to 2M (blockweight up to 8M).
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:38:02
Once you start realize there is more than one Bitcoin software in the Bitcoin ecosystem, some with slightly different consensus rules like Core, BU, btc1, then following the most proof of work regardless of blocksize seems the most logical step to me. 
"Flip flop" is called chain reorganization based on most proof of work and really happens - the largest one is about 40 blocks if I remember correctly, but there is no guarantee there wont be bigger in the future. Its how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:32:36
Coin price determine hashrate - I think most people understand it already, dont underestimate em'.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:43:26
You dont need any replay protection. If there ever become two live chains, you can taint your coins to coinbase coins unique to each chain.
Anyway, most people here did not like the proposed replay protection few days ago anyway, so you sound like guys who are never happy no matter what.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:29:24
Nicely written. I still believe most people are reasonable and prefer fair market resolution as is Xapo policy, over a toxic community making everyone who have different opinion enemy  and worshipping those with the same opinion like gods.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:50:10
Yes, you can use your paper wallet as usual. If there are two coins in November, your private key on your paper wallet give you access to both.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:52:03
Bitcoin Core 0.15 blocks SegWit2x nodes, thus is not Bitcoin community project anymore. Blacklisting your oponent you disagree with showed true color of Core developers. Shame on everyone running Bitcoin Core 0.15.
PS: I was Bitcoin-qt user in the past, I just disagree with current Core policy.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:44:11
Did you ever noticed part of Bitcoin economy upgraded so it is valid longest chain for them ? So my statement holds, the chain price going to define hashrates, and most PoW become Bitcoin (BTC). The only other option would be to have authority who define what Bitcoin (BTC) is, but there is no such authority because Bitcoin is decentralized.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:07:07
I thought luke-jr prepared a ASIC resilent algo to defend Bitcoin from the hostile miners.
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:14:03
Pro: 2x more Bitcoin onchain transaction capacity than segwit1x.
Con: more data to download/upload/store for full Bitcoin nodes.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:10:28
As the Bitcoin value goes up, fees going up as well. The Satoshi per byte wont go down in the future. Why ? Because the block space going to be limited the same way no matter how much the Bitcoin value go up.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:53:30
There is no technical reason to blacklist SegWit2x nodes now as they are completly compatible before the fork and become uncompatible after the fork anyway.
Thats why the decision is just a political one. The only malicious client is the one blacklisting other compatible nodes because of politic. This blacklisting showed true color of Core developers.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:14:41
Huh, proof of printed paper. Let me guess, everyone agreed with the text. lol
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:41:57
Check some altcoin hardforks. The name and ticket is indeed keept to the chain with most market support.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:59:50
The Bitcoin upgrade is not tied to date, but block 494784 instead. If two chains become live, the snapshot of BT1 and BT2 is at block 494783. It seems the market standart is the chain with most accumulated difficulty become Bitcoin (BTC), Xapo and blockchain made it clear already
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:28:25

Xapo just protect their users: Bitcoin (BTC) is the chain with most PoW regardless of blocksize, and Xapo users are free to withdraw or convert the minority chain (if it become live and tradable minority chain).
Seems very fair to me.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:13:39
Your right, only gamblers going to send all their Bitcoins at exchange. There is no trustless way to trade the split futures, unfortunatelly.
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:39:14
Your idea looks like comunism to me if you think every node is equeal. 
Thats why I use BU node for my own protection to follow most proof of work regardless of blocksize, to stay away from politic and follow financial incentives which ensures its Bitcoin chain in the long run.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:45:27
Maybe after the Bitcoin upgrade at block 494784. It seems market expect two coins thats why the buy ups to have free coin in November. So, greed, as usual.
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:31:43
Bitcoin is the chain with most proof of work regardless of blocksize.
If 1M is such great concept with higher market support, you should not worry it gets most proof of work eventually, thus Bitcoin name.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:55:07


Nice to see they at least opened possibility to list chain with most PoW regardless of blocksize as Bitcoin (BTC).
If really market makes the upgrade in November as it seems most likely outcome today, naming the not working chain with few blocks everyday as Bitcoin (BTC) would be truly inresponsible from them.
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:17:22
There are different nodes in the Bitcoin ecosystem though. For some nodes 2x is required (like btc1), for some it is invalid (like Core) and others dont care and just follow most proof of work (like BU).

In the current UTXO set, there are economicaly unspedable inputs already. I think it is a problem, maybe you should focus on this in your article as well.
