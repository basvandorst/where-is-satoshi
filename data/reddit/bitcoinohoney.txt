Lol wtf? 8%?! Just stop, kid. You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. Go ask your parents about how buying a home works.

Lol dude, don't be an idiot. Those massive addresses are exchange and casino hot wallets. How many millionaires do you actually think are invested in bitcoin?

So... you agree that he's probably wrong... and that he is incorrectly using his "evidence"... but you're splitting hairs around use of the word "baseless" to support him..?
People on reddit are way too fucking horny to play Devil's Advocate.

Lol please enlighten us on your highly developed expert opinions on market manipulation, professor.

Yikes - out of touch white guy, much?
Let me guess: you live in an apartment that your parents pay for and go to school on their dime? Never had any real responsibilities or money constraints in your entire life?

You're 33 years old and you don't know anyone in your life that can't afford a big screen TV? Where the fuck do you live? Or do you just only know like 2 people?
You sound like an elitist fuck-tard. I can't believe you got through 33 years of life without understanding that the level of affluence you are talking about is not in any way average or normal.
Also, judging by your utter lack of comprehension in regards to the value of a dollar for most people, I am going to guess that I was dead-on about Mommy and Daddy completely financially supporting you throughout your entire early adulthood.

Lol wtf are you talking about dude? Are you blaming Bitcoin for the fact that credit card fees exist? You do not NEED to buy coin with credit cards - you are just including those fees in the process as if it's mandatory?


Could not be less true..?

Lulz then don't buy bitcoin, dude - wtf do i care? Just don't fucking bitch about CC fees like it's a problem with Bitcoin. It sounds like you pay CC fees on literally everything in your life.

Translation:"I'm too stupid to defend the stupid shit I've come here to say, so I'm just going to pretend like anyone that tells me I'm saying stupid shit is corrupt and biased."
Reality: You're stupid and wrong. When people are stupid and wrong, other people tend to point it out to them. It has nothing to do with or people being early adopters. You're just dumb and people will continue to point that out to you throughout your life.

What the fuck are you talking about???




He literally never implied either of these things... No one in this thread did... Did you just write a page and a half comment in response to an imaginary person???
