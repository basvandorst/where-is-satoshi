weird, try scanning it from the image you posted.
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:59:07
What I got when scanning it: KzPvQE7xnRbFw8VnU6cyoYnXNbd8tRNHuTKa1bpnspz9Xtot4aFS
Which looked like a private key to me, so I got the public key of that which is: 1BgGZ9tcN4rm9KBzDn7KprQz87SZ26SAMH

There are no free bank accounts in the Netherlands. Only for students. Cheapest one I could find is the ASN Bank which charges 1,25 a month.

yes Bram Moolenaar accepts bitcoin donations for vim, even gives you the voting rights for new features, same as with normal donations through paypal
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:43:17
Good they finally have their shit together. Had a bad experience with them for Christmas shopping last year. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:10:57
Please dont use that service. They didnt deliver my order from 14th of december for Christmas and I didn't get a reply from them for 3 month till I mentioned sueing, then they returned my bitcoins which was payed for through bitpay so they even made money from it. Use snapcard instead. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 08:16:25
Even though the product has to be build. What kind of bullshit is this? And how can they already have 15M?

The bitcoin news network With bitcoin 101 i found a good intro
@_date: 2014-10-19 13:26:36
But this is , people already know about bitcoin in here. Maybe start promoting it elsewhere?
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:03:10
Turned some btc into fiat to go on a holiday. It was fun. Invested some in dogecoin and made all spent btc back. Pretty solid.
But I usually spend btc on takeaway.com to show people unfamiliar with bitcoin what it does
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:05:26
Why not make a unique address per item. Then in the terminal at the cashier they gave different addresses different wallet names which corresponds with the item. Way easier!
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:40:40
really donating to yourself?
Your mother was probably very proud when you told her that you shared your lunch with yourself.
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:11:29
So do you have the items now? Thinking maybe I should do the same
@_date: 2014-04-15 12:32:25
These guys arent that trustworthy. Took me more than a month to finally get a reply on my order. Wouldnt So business again With them. Watch out!
@_date: 2014-01-08 01:18:13
more people have bad experiences with all4btc
i posted also my story there.
People should be advised to no use their services anymore.
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:46:18
I have the same experience with all4btc I ordered 3 books from an online store on 15 December. At first, before I had ordered, they responded quickly to my questions, so I trusted it. After I paid it went silent. I sent multiple emails but I never had a response.
Still haven't received my order and the order page says it hasn't been ordered.
Shame on them! Especially because those books where Christmas presents.
Next time I'll try snapcard or that service OP talks about
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:18:04

For the downloaded wallet with much GB there are already solutions like electrum, armory, multibit. And even for Android mycellium and bitcoin wallet.
Those mobile wallets have sweep options of a private key.  
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:49:50
You are an idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:27:14
I think this constitutes as begging
you only have 0.0175 BTC on there.
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:16:07
Lots of coins are lost, so nope. Not possible. Ever.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:54:13
I mined mine back in the day. I don't care what they are worth. Already had plenty of fun because of their value .
@_date: 2014-05-17 19:09:31
If your donation was falsely claimed you could sign a message I suppose. Very easy thing to rollback I think.. you should read his blog he was in Uganda recently. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:25:31
I withrew 10 bitcoin for $100 From mtgox, also regretting that. Mostly because it was a joke never expected that to happen
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:46:41
I had 6 BTC in there, then I keep reading about the mantra store your BTC offline, so when it was still possible I moved 5 BTC out to offline wallet and kept 1 BTC in there just in case.
But then when SR was raided I thought, you know I better not.
Sorry for all the people lost money in here, i'm glad I didn't 
on the other hand most of my BTC is in LTC now, and that isn't going so great either. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:27:28
Why are you quitting and not just leave it in a paper wallet somewhere.
Can't hurt.
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:15:25
haha, so sad. made me laugh though. 
Nobody ever get the feel of holding 100% of the bitcoins
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:07:25
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:38:24

6btc for a telephone jammer. Just to proof to my family that it wasn't silly money but that it had buying power.
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:17:44
What is it with you people wanting to have bitcoin at 1mm or even 100k. You just want to join the rich elite. All this encouraging of people with some small amount of bitcoin holding on to this belief that they could be stinking rich one day if only they hold, it's illusive, and frankly not at all anti establishment. 
On another note, who needs encouraging, we are still at a mega uptrend.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:43:25
Please don't do that. You don't want to be anxious to sleep, because you are afraid to wake up to a -%.

I have the same thing. Ordered 3 books 2 weeks ago, initially they were very fast with replies, now I have mailed them thrice, yet I haven't had a single reply. It was also a christmas gift, so I would not recommend this service, until they sort things out.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:22:46
Yeah I know, I made the same mistake.

well you can do quite a lot with CSS these days.
and just jquery + ajax. And if you want to get really fancy, you could do websockets.
still awesome that you made something, always good to have creators and not consumers, a tip of the hat to you, good sir.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:48:30
but flash, think about iDevices, not that bitcoin and iDevices play nice.
But I'm on Linux and I also don't like flash.
flash is an evil memoryhogger

Why the 7 day delay if they're only out for today? Is it a week limit? And why don't they raise that limit?
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:25:45
So I still heard nothing
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:05:39
I also got into it as soon as I heard but to be honest my first thought was: "cool I can make money while my computer is on" which is always. After I bought a telephone jammer for 6.5 btc from Hong Kong in 2011, to show my family that it was really money I was hooked myself.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:28:15
why do you use flash?
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:48:20
please make that happen, for now there is no way to send a message with my bitcoin contribution with the link you send, also it's default is 0.5 btc which you deserve, but is a bit high for me.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:44:28
maybe make it payable through bitcoin? I would really like to see it, but i'm living in Europe, and don't have a creditcard, I do however have bitcoin!

I also emailled them about this. But now the titles I wanted to buy don't have discount on them. Perhaps I'll keep an eye on it.
Still haven't had a reply though, guess that isn't necessary anymore now.
Yeaah Bitcoin! Yeah Humble Bundle, this was probably one of the first things I ever bought with my bitcoins, and I could show off to my friends, most of them now also use bitcoins.
