What bothers me in this video is that she's way too much on one side and is, de facto, too subjective, whereas I was hoping for a serious reporting job. Moreover, she talks about some stuff the defense claims as fact whereas they're not. 
For instance, Karpelès doesn't own silkroadmarket[dot]org domain name, and it can be easily verified. This domain name was bought by a customer of KalyHost.com, service provided by a subsidiary of Tibane, owned by ... MK. Okay, that's still weird, but it's way more subtle than the defense pretends it is. 
That's the same for the "death threats" Karpelès is accused of ... Just think about it: MK is accused of sending death treats by email. Is this serious? If that was real, 1- it would have been known already due to the fact that the Japanese currently investigate on Mt. Gox liquidation 2- do you actually really believe that, a guy capable of creating by its own an entire economy joining the efforts of Mt. Gox and Silkroad and doing it without being caught for years, could have been so careless when doing death threats? If Mark Karpelès is such a Keyzer Söze, we'll never be able to prove anything because it would mean he's one of the most brilliant con man of the decade at least. 
In fact, I'm quite fascinated by the theory claiming that MK is an evil mastermind "puppetting" everything and hiding his true nature behind the nerd cliché and an iced coffee. That would be such a great movie scenario! But I don't believe it's true, sadly; facts are just too overwhelming for Ross, and all of that is just an admirably clever defense strategy hoping to create doubt in jury's mind. 
To be continued!

Thanx for the clarification! Anyway it doesn't change the vagueness of this research in term of background.
And talking of background, I think we have to take in consideration that being sued by the US government must be totally time-consuming, and a lack of time could more likely lead to incompetence instead of evilish plots. This could help us understanding what happened in 2013-2014.

"On 15 May 2013, the US authorities seized accounts associated with Mt. Gox after discovering that it had not registered as a money transmitter with FinCEN in the US." (source:  I'm pretty sure he refers to that in the video. 
This seizure is kind of fun because, still now, the bitcoin isn't clearly defined as a form of money.

The Attorney-at-law in charge of MtGox bankruptcy is Nobuaki Kobayashi. KOBAYASHI. Like, you know, in the movie:

I'm not an expert, but I kept an eye on all of this, and I think this research forgets to mention the context of several stuff. 
 - "Mark Karpeles' holding company bought silkroadmarket.org": KalyHost offers to provide domain names with the hosting service, like many other companies, but -I'll have to check that- it was probably the only one accepting BTC as payment by this time; that fact could explain why the person who wanted to own this domain name used KalyHost. 
 - "In May 2013 the separate homeland security investigation seized $2 million from Karpeles [for] running an unlicensed money exchange": I believe it's more like 5M$, not 2, and it was seized from Mt. Gox, not Karpeles. And, once again remember the background: by this time, Bitcoin was not clearly defined as a form of money (and still isn't), so there is nothing relating the seizure with the US investigation on SR.
 - "Karpeles offered to “out” Dread Pirate Roberts in exchange for exemption from running an unlicensed money exchange": I don't understand how this reveal could have helped an exemption. 
And it's quite amusing to see how people went from believing Karpeles was a stupid and incompetent PHP nerd to an evil mastermind.

It may be beyond you because you're speculating on events you have no factual details on. But hopefully, some of the missing facts will be revealed thanks to those new revelations about Force and shit.

Wait a sec... Carl Mark... Mark Carl...peles? The Force is strong with this one, too.

This is the best drama I've ever watched too: neverending plots and laughs! Thx for the laugh,

Nah, probably freaking scared about journalists as they've been doing a great job at stalking/harrassing him and anyone close to him for one year until he was put in jail *11 months ago*.
