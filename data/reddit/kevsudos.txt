I see, I think I will get a KeepKey as well. Will it cost me money to transfer bitcoins from Coinbase to KeepKey? When I decided to spend bitcoins, do I do it through KeepKey's chrome extension? Do they take a cut as well? Thank you!

I didn't have enough bitcoins to matter, but since they becoming cheaper; I was buying more and moving some of them to a wallet :P

So if someone decides to smash my KeepKey, then all my coins are gone?
