Localbitcoins, LibertyX are good too. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 04:16:06
What about ads claiming to be bought with cash? Seller is offering 500usd eBay gift card code for 0.5 BTC. He says he will provide cash receipt, this one sounds more believable. Seller has verified phone, identification, etc
@_date: 2016-08-02 17:34:19
These aren't legal without a prescription in the is correct? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:32:43
Localbitcoins.com also try to see if LibertyX is available in your area. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 18:31:42
Delta gift cards on there as well. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:42:36
But wouldn't a quarter of the profits just be as hard to hide? Maybe if they returned it all and entered a no prosecution contract maybe that would work, but I wouldn't see them just returning them. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:57:52
I doubt it. Why would you do this if you already have the money? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:51:23
It'd take less time to google it then what you did. Much less time in fact. Google Trezor, read the results, how could it be simpler than that?? 
@_date: 2016-08-20 01:35:50
Nice. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:54:25
Wait.... Wasn't everyone saying how shitty blockchain wallet here on this very forum just a few months ago? 
@_date: 2016-08-25 02:39:00
I would think it'd have to work somewhat. It's a USA seller with over 150 BTC volume 1000+ trades and 100% positive reviews. I read a few reviews out of 100 that I read that were negative saying eBay closed there accounts but they received there item. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 03:01:30
Bitsoup for iOS 
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:39:09
They even stopped Gyft from accepting BTC for Walmart gift cards. There nowhere close to accepting BTC 
@_date: 2016-08-17 02:06:19
You can buy a gift card from Gyft for eBay then buy the wallet.

Wow 224 transactions of people that actually believed it. Sad. Why would a man who's has almost 120,000 coins charge you anything? 
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:30:49
Indeed it is ;)
@_date: 2016-08-24 23:20:25
Me either. Done mostly bank deposits though. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:54:37
Why would they have so many positive reviews if it wasn't successful? I agree with you in a way about the too good to be true. I just don't understand why so many are on there with so many trades. LBC is usaully quite good at removing scammers. Have you tried to use this service before? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:30:21
Why would they need to wait? Couldn't they wash it through grams or anything Bitcoin blender and be good to go? 
@_date: 2016-08-24 23:49:14
I kind of suspected this. So will the transaction not go through and ship or what? 
@_date: 2016-08-25 02:39:06

Where in the world are you where you can't use google? 
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:12:10
Also blockchain has been around for a good long while. Bitcoins early days were plagued by theft. In several of the larger exchanges. I guess it took developers a while to secure it better. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:31:10
Ok now I understand. Yeah I use a 17-23 character password for everything I do. Use encryption for everything I do. Never use the same password for any site I visit. I don't have a Facebook, Google + etc. I would consider myself a paranoid security person so when I saw the hatred for blockchain I worried. Knowing this info I feel slightly more comfortable but still never store more than 1 BTC on a wallet connected to the Internet. Edit to say I get exactly what you mean, especially with bitcoins. It seems like every ass hole thief in the world are gunning for my coins and I'd still rather have every cent I own in Bitcoin then give my money to big banks. Them fucks are the real theives if you want to be real. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 23:26:48
Can you post the thieves address? I want to follow the taint see where they went. Also were you the only victim of said attack? Seems strange a multimillion dollar company would only steal your 4 coins when lots of use have 30x that. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:16:16
I hate banks and everything they stand for, I am in control of my own money, it can't be taken from me without beating the private key out of me, hell how much time do you have? I can go on forever. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:13:09
Only ATM in my area charges a outrageous 17% 
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:11:05
Ok just to clarify what is the difference between a web wallet and a cellphone wallet? Don't both store your private keys online? How is bread wallet any different than blockchain wallet on a iPhone? 
@_date: 2016-06-02 20:26:04
Pray you had 2fa enabled. Unless they got a defeat for that too. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 15:03:51

Cocaine is a hell of a drug apparently. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 06:17:25
I'm not really assuming anything. No one really knows what the price will do. Just have some coins and want them to be as valuable as possible. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 04:33:22
I turned the phone off then back on and it's there now. Weird and annoying but I've fixed it. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:46:41
Yeah and even if it stays the same its money I'm comfortable with saving. To be honest I want to get to the point to where I'm putting any extra fiat into Bitcoin. I wish they had more than just one overpriced restaurant in the area to spend bitcoins but it's TN there isn't no Bitcoin businesses here period.  If it was i would live off of Bitcoin. I hate crooked ass thieving banks. Overdrafts are bullshit and I have a feeling they pocket money sometimes without my knowledge. I am a put my money in a mattress with a gun under my pillow kind of girl. I don't trust anyone with my money!
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:14:09
Yeah it seems daunting at first but it's a easy process. The annoying part comes while waiting for seller to release the coins. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 05:36:36
I'm sure if you search you can find a subreddit that would be cater to your needs OP, your probably not gonna find someone who is interested in helping you launder your money here. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 04:54:25
This platform has some potential once they get all the bugs worked out 
@_date: 2016-06-09 16:08:14
If the money isn't dirtied by his hands use coinbase and it's fine but if your buddy is doing nefarious things coinbase is a terrible idea. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:53:59
Why does everyone dislike blockchain wallet here? I've got bread and blockchain but blockchain lets me use 2fa, has tor blocking, email verification, IP address blocking, etc, security features none of the other phone wallets have, so why is it considered so bad?

@_date: 2016-06-03 04:38:21
Thanks I'm hoping so. If anything if I don't lose anything I'll be happy. It's not a get rich scheme for me. I believe in Bitcoin and would more or less use it as a savings account in a way. It's much easier in the area I live to buy then it is to sell, I'm not the best at budgeting money so it will be a way to save some funds. Make sense? 
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:37:16
Looking like 700-800 by the halving at least. Maybe higher.

I use Bitsoup on the iPhone. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 21:17:03
I checked on Liberty x for Southern California where I've noticed more Bitcoin businesses then any other state and only seen one store that takes the new kinds of transactions.  Well it appears anyway cause it asks for your account pin instead of the phone card style verifone machines. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:15:46
That's exactly what I thought. I'm already set on getting some lol I just wanted a few comments to make me feel better about it I guess. Me and my bf love bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:40:40
I've been considering buying and running a BTC ATM since the only one in my whole state charges nearly 22% a transaction. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 12:56:13
Bread stores your private keys on the device and not the web. I asked this same thing yesterday. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:57:16
My first BTC ATM purchase was buttery smooth. Scan QR code on bread wallet, insert cash, confirm and done. Just wish it wasn't in a laundromat in the absolute worst part of town in the whole city. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:34:35
Would you explain in technical terms why you believe there added security features are ineffective or are you just under the assumption they are inadequate.  
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:55:30
I wouldn't think that's true. If I get the message server is lagging I just switch to another server and were good. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 03:46:42
I keep asking the same thing. Are there other phone wallets that offer 2fa, TOR blocking and IP address matching? Seems like a lot of security that I know bread sure don't have. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 15:02:38
That's what I've read too. There a really great service. Man I hope they come back soon. There missing out on all this great bull market buying 
@_date: 2016-06-11 00:50:38
Do your research next time. The sites name even sounds scammy. Sorry you lost your coins. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 20:14:17
They have a live support chat on there page, have you tried that? 
@_date: 2016-06-08 03:00:30

@_date: 2016-06-08 19:58:02
When you privatize your government services this is what happens. TN is a prime example of this. Corrupt businesses and corrupt politicians go hand in hand. This should be illegal. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 20:52:40
I haven't contacted support but I'm sure I would get the same response. Is it true that liberty x is a offshoot of Liberty reserve? I've heard this before but not seen any claims to back it up. It went down around the time the founder of Liberty reserve was sentenced. Maybe just a coincidence. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 17:15:51
Could you put the thieves wallet address here so I can copy and paste it? Want to do taint analysis on where your coins went 
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:39:18
Ok by up you can buy pin less transactions in any amount? Cause they still have the old 50 at a time accounts active but there website states it's down system wide until the upgrade is complete for the new pin less system

@_date: 2016-06-01 20:50:50
Is it because your private key is stored on there servers? It's the only negative I have seen to blockchain wallet. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 16:14:22
I haven't seen any laws about it here in TN personally. The machine we have here does nothing to confirm your identity or anything. Insert cash, receive BTC. I've seen machines for as low as $2,800 shipped.

Also have you not followed the news OP? Coinbase is definitely not the best place to do this. If you think so ask the guys that robbed sheep marketplace. They'll tell you how good of a idea coinbase is. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 00:30:53
Turn your device off then back on or force close the app. This happened to me yesterday. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 20:21:32
It's a known scam site. So probably. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 16:09:31
Lmao I am, but I won't tell you that. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:13:10
Yeah that's what I said. I know no one can predict what it will do but most of the analysts I've read say the price will increase. I'm not positive but was wanting to know what the community thinks. Thank you for your analysis and opinion. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:54:03
Make sure it really is a two way machine. The only one in my whole state is a Genesis ATM but turned out to be a one way only machine in the hood. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:42:37
Wow that's dirty. I'm sorry. Oh and I would enable 2fa since they offer it. Just noticed that and edited my post. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:08:26
Ugly. Yeah I wouldn't  use Blocktrail, though I have hunted through the settings how can I get Bread to display my balance in something other than bits? 
@_date: 2016-06-08 17:14:39
So if I read this correctly someone sent you like $2 during the attack? 
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:35:08
The only BTC ATM in my state charges 17% for buys. Count yourself lucky

@_date: 2016-06-09 04:56:59
I think OP is saying but not saying these coins are dirtier than a NY subway 
@_date: 2016-06-15 07:44:22
Hopefully it confirms soon, if I'm not mistaken bitmixer only allows a limited time to process transaction to the address it provides. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:12:59
Ugly. I wonder if OP knew this? 
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:00:22
I've never heard of peer play is it a scam?
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:38:29
A lot won't sell to you either being in NY they got shitty BTC laws. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 05:36:59
Those stores are those crappy pin based 50 max per card stores until the system is up from what I read on there site not one updated any amount from 1-1000 stores are in service in my area 
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:14:21

Localbitcoins has listings for vanilla reload packs. Though I wouldn't 100% trust them. I got burned on PayPal my cash. It transferred to my account all well and good. When I went to spend them, PayPal said my account has been closed due to fraud. So I was out 0.5 btc. Though admittedly I should of known better. They offer as much as 800 per coin for gift cards and such. Just be careful. I'd spend the money before you release escrow to make sure your not getting screwed 
@_date: 2016-05-14 14:50:44
Cause I live in the southern US where no one takes bitcoin.
