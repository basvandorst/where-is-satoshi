I like btc but money is money sold all BTC for BCH, trailing stop orders ready for the crash back.

More like Bitcoin has no longer any soul. Satoshi envisioned stable money that was fair and decentralized. Right now it's just a speculation instrument of the most capitalistic liberalistic kind. I thought we were fighting this with BTC initially ?

Just pointing out the hypocrite level of BTC maximalists.

I was in Korea in vacation 3 weeks ago and I paid my meal with xrp within 5 seconds the payment was settled. 0 fees. 
Well the xrp quadrupled in value so that meal ended up costing me 400 dollars instead of 100 but whatever.

BTC only exists through exchanges at current price, if BTC had to be used for real life payments without exchanges it would collapse, hell even fiat needs currency exchange at a global level to remain stable.
Regulating exchanges or BTC is the very same thing as long as I'm not buying my groceries in BTC, buying in BTC, paying taxes in BTC... Tl Dr as long as we need a gateway for fiat to BTC or BTC to fiat gateway you cannot separate the two.

Yea or we could just use XRP and it would be solved by tomorrow, roger ver, scam artists and all the chinese miner cartels with it, btc or xrp to the everyday mainstream user without any political of ideology inference, theres no difference as long as it equals e-mail for money, technology and mankind moving forward.

My body is ready for 10k BCH before end of the week.

Bitcoins never gonna be a revolution to the poor.
It's just gonna be is early investor's being rich.
It's still cold blooded capitalism with wealth concentration.
Leave the poor out of it.

Here comes the massive DDOS shorting dump of our beloved whales. Rest in peace new buyers.

Sure like to pay 30$ fees to buy a pair of Snickers that will be worth 2 million dollars in 10 years yeah.

The lel when all the newbies discover they can't cash out or if they cash out they'll only get a fraction and a headache.

95% of banks are responsible with loans.
5% of exchanges are responsible with margin

You'll be just as much a slave with BTC.
BTC holds value because you don't go around spending it to buy groceries every day. 
If BTC becomes a real day to day currency where people spend without thinking about speculating the whole value born out of the HODL mantra will vanish.

Distributed evenly rofl rofl rofl rofl. You'll always have whales pushing politics just look at what jihan and ver are doing and BTC isn't even worth close to 50k yet. Imagine with ten time the value in their stack the ammount of power you give to people who are sometimes just as stupid as whatever...
Also BTC needs to move to proof of stake, current mining power requirements are unsustainable.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:16:00
Right I supposed mining BTC on a computer in 2010 was such effort of clicking a .exe and sitting on your ass. Sure compares to billion dollars business empires.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:26:53
Congrats you will then be the evil you speak of. Whale BTC holders become crooks and war mongers too, wealth is no at all more evenly distributed but opportunity to acquire may be.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:06:21
My face when btc is back at 900 dollars before 2020.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:38:18
Bitcoin is still shitty as a form of payment. Hopefully we get VISA tokencard to pay with eth and tokens soon with swipe to pay.

Here comes XRP time.

Bitcoin aint gonna give you a student loan or for a home.

Well it's below 80% now at 79%
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:03:29
People don't get that all it takes for the lock in to fail is one missing block. The hash can be 99.99 % for the whole period and if miners drop the signalling to 0% before the last block (a quarter of an hour) it won't lock in.
Stop looking at pointless percentages. It's all about a big red button and whos gonna press it or not.
Miners would press it to make shorts and then go long ? Probably since they are greed driven.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:36:34
Anyone hoping to recover a single BTC from BTCe is delusional. They don't even have your BTC you deposited in the first place. They sold them for fiat to run away with ages ago.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:38:49
Tldr : list of exchanges who are not solvent and do not have control of the exact same ammount of BTC they are supposed to hold. 
If you are on any of these exchanges I would leave the fuck as soon as possible.
