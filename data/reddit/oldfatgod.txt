100,000,000 units per each bitcoin makes 2.1×10¹⁵ Satoshis (less the lost btc) circulating in the economy.
 That's why its called 'deflationary.'

This is a good question. I, as a bitcoin booster have been challenged with this scenario by some 'end-of-the-worlders'; so I'd love to actually read some specific thoughts on this point. 
btw, I keep my wallet on an 32gb patriot rage USB encrypted with Truecrypt.

Yeah, I noticed the twitter shills are trumpeting "DHS shuts down transfers 'for bitcoin' from dwolla" to make it sound like the G.U.S. has prevented dollars-&gt;bitcoin altogether. 
It is a 1.99% premium compared to .6% with mtgox, but it is faster than waiting for Dwolla to transfer to mtgox and mtgox to put the order in and then having to go through the extra steps of withdrawing from mtgox.

One of the custom-made botnet miners available on "Black Market Reloaded" (on TOR) is written with the payout address written into the code so that its unchangeable.... perhaps someone used that address for their botnet mining operation and whatever pool its associated with autopays when it hits .25.  
Of course... I only know of these things because I've been told of them....I have no idea about any botnet mining operations in real life.... no idea at all.

Oh yeah, impossible to generate the same address; I can imagine a scenario wherein someone could be working too long and not paying attention, and accidentally copying and pasting the wrong address on a line that should have had his own... perhaps he grabbed it from the wrong source, or had used it to pay out at another time.  Pure speculation.

Thanks. I've backed it up in several places, but I hadn't thought of SD cards too. Thanks for the tip.
