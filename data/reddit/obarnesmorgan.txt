I mean, you could just use a bank transfer, which is free, instant and... well I can’t actually think of a drawback unless you’re a drug dealer. 
Though if you’re in the UK when the next Microsoft Surface comes out, it’s cheaper to fly to New York for the weekend and pick one up than to buy one here. (Top end models). 
Just have to take it out of the box before getting on the plane so it doesn’t look new.

Electrum is a software wallet. An easy one to use (if you have an iPhone) is Bread Wallet and I can recommend it highly. If you have an Android I cannot recommend Bread. 
You'll find Bread very easy to set up and use, but you MUST write down your words, or if your phone is lost, stolen &amp; sometimes updated you will lose everything!
Bread will support both chains sometime soon after the fork, so you're safe there. 
If you think you might need to withdraw some after the fork and before it's safe and won't worry about losing the same amount of free coins as the coins you're selling, then Bread is also a good option. 
If you know you definitely won't need to touch your coins until it is safe to do so and the split is complete, then Coinbase will also be fine if you don't have a large amount of money. Coinbase will support both, but they will lock all transactions from the time of the split, until it's safe to trade without losing any free coins. 
Coinbase is an exchange so you don't own your keys. 
Bread is a wallet and you own your keys, so you can recover to any other wallet using the same private key input.

Personally I don't use electrum, I'm not keen on it. 
So long as you got it from the link on Bitcoin.org then you're alright

Why, and what would you recommend? 
Is there anything as straight forward and simple that you can recommend?
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:38:37
Perhaps you could help me understand something? 
I have mine transferred to a bread wallet. 
After the fork what happens? As far as I understand it splits into two coins, so say there was $1000 in BTC made from 1BTC (obvs not real numbers) does it become: 
$500 - 0.1 BTC
$500 - 0.9 BTC2
or 
$100 - 0.5 BTC
$900 - 0.5 BTC2
$500 - 1BTC
$500 - 1BTC2
An in whichever case, how do I get a hold of each, when what I have is 1BTC in Bread? How do you get the BTC2?
Some people have said you sell your 1BTC after the fork you’ve lost your BTC2, but why? If you exchange your 1BTC into 1000USD, then what have you lost?

Even better, looking at his history in 2 minutes you can narrow him down to a country, possibly a city if you read dutch. 
And then, he once posted a list of every thing he had installed on his jailbroken phone at the time, which if this was 2yrs ago would definitely narrow down your search for an exploit. Theres also what equipment he’s running at home, what he has installed on his home computer. 
I’m sure if someone was motivated enough...
Nobody who uses the internet is ever totally secure. So never telling anyone the figure in your account just keeps you from being a target.  
Plus. It’s just common sense. 
There’s not much need for social engineering, when people are inherently social.

Me too, well not a franchise, but had my eye on some businesses for sale on holiday islands around Europe, saw a company that rents out electric vehicles for island touring which looked right up my street, but dont have quite enough for that right now.
Hopefully get something similar another time.

Since you’re a student ignore the hell out of coinbase etc. The fees will be more than you’ll make. 
Buy through localbitcoins
Then move it to a Bread wallet on your phone. Just remember to write down your paper key and keep it safe in case you lose your phone. 
If you ever need to sell any send back to localbitcoins. 
Selling through coinbase can take weeks to get your money and their customer service is non-existent for months.

I’m a noob, and dont have huge amounts invested, just what i can afford to lose. But I’ve moved all of mine to Bread for IOS (and i think android). 
Seems like the best place for it, you have the keys, its easy to use, no sign up etc. Just make sure to write down the key.

But what about the next sentence?

[Thats not what they’re saying]( 
They say you can follow whichever you want to after the November fork. 
Am I reading that right?
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:25:30
Nobody knows they exist. Because they’re poorly implemented. And to be fair, don’t even work. They also dont update in the background, so you have to go to the widgets screen then sit and wait for them to update one by one. Of course you’ll never know which ones are still updating and which just dont have anything to update to because if you dont see it update theres nothing to say the last time it updated. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:24:49
Please explain why? 
iOS has good security if you’re not jailbroken, even if you lose it or it’s stolen you can remotely wipe it, and if you kept your backup keys you can load onto your replacement. You also dont need to use your main handset, you can use an old one you keep at home. Bitcoin.org doesn’t have any negatives for it

It’s called a gun. 
If they can hack your computer, they also know everything about you, including kids school. 
People who brag about having millions from early adoption are targets to both kinds of criminals

I switched to LBC when I couldn’t get my money out of coinbase for over a month, and no response from their frankly fucking awful customer service, and spending £50 in bank fees trying to verify my account to withdraw. 
Ended up selling them through LBC which I had avoided as it wasnt as safe, but not I’m sold on only using that.

Especially since this guy advertises that he uses a jailbroken iphone and asks for keygens from people online :)

Buy and hold both. 
One will be like keeping a banana in a fruitbowl for 10 years and then eating it. 
One will be like planting an apple in the ground and years later eating the fruit off it without ever touching the apple itself.

Ah I see, if I’m doing 2,500 gbp or less I use my debit card, for anything more I use instant transfers with localbitcoin. 
Though I’m very new to this so not moving large numbers around. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:46:24
Why do I keep seeing people saying money transfers take them a long time? Are you using cheque and pigeon to transfer money? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:15:13
Some people like segwit2x, some people (this sub) don’t. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:07:13
How long do you predict needing to wait before spending them? 
I have mine in Bread at the moment (great app by the way!), but I will need to send a large amount of them over to localbitcoins to sell as I’ve got a friend with a business opportunity to invest in. I will wait until it’s safe to do so, but wanted to know if you think that’s weeks or months? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:49:02
It’s good for streaming movies and tv 
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:51:51
If you never let go and sell, what was the point?
You can’t take them to the afterlife.
