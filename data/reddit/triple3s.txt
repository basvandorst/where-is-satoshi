If you wanted to wager 1 Bitcoin ~ $66 and bet the .0015% you'd win $4.2 million.
Or bet 1 Bitcoin on 36.6211% chance to win (Which is better than having two spades in your hand with a flop of two spades and the turn and river to come you win 2.670x your bet or $176.00

Xinhua Shanghai November 27 (Reporter Ye Jian, Zheng Jun days) only a month's time, bitcoins from 1000 yuan soared to over 5,000, many of the "Chinese Mother" also joined the ranks of fried bitcoin . From gold to stir Bitcoin berserk, all follow suit wealth behind refraction public financial anxiety.
    Traditional financial products cold
    In the 24th Money Expo in Shanghai ended, more than 250 exhibiting companies, more than 150,000 people visited the public, a record high number of visitors. This fully shows that the current financial awareness of the people is growing.
    However, in the A-share performance continues to decline, the policy does not relax the purchase of the property market environment, people are still narrow investment channels.
    Bank financial management, the bank's booth this year has been reduced. A bank manager is also only a few customers present to accept advice. Reporters at the scene found the show launched financial products and buy products through conventional channels is no different, the annual yield also no obvious attraction is concentrated in 4% -5%.
    Trust products, several investors told reporters that hundreds of millions of threshold Trust prohibitive. Mr Li said, "If I have a few million, went directly to buy a house, who to this point of view trust products ah?"
    It also reflects the high threshold of trust products to match but did not achieve yields. Reporters found that the annualized rate of return in this year's trust products 6-9%, 10-13% in previous years is difficult to reproduce high yield. Therefore, it is not surprising that investors are voting with their feet.
    Even after the precious metals of concern, as the U.S. has strengthened expectations of QE exit and the dollar strengthened, but also suffered investment bottlenecks. This year, gold prices continued to fall, so many investors their investments become more rational. On the first day of Shanghai Money Fair held "2013 China Precious Metal Industry Development Summit Forum", the Securities and Futures Institute of Beijing Technology and Business University, Hu Yu Yue pointed out that "the end of the golden age of gold, investors should note the risk of fried gold."
    Emerging risks of financial products
    Corresponding to this is that new financial products attracted the interest of the people, especially single expo also established a new financial enterprise zones.
    Among the many new financial exhibitors, hedge funds also appeared on the scene. While Soros' Quantum Fund "Let the hedge fund world famous, but for Chinese investors, hedge funds also belong fresh products.
    Gao Yang Qingyu wealth, president told reporters, "As the hedge fund professional, so half of the public do not know much, but we found that the hedge fund market in China now becomes active, strong investor interest and more expected next year will greet to faster development, so we have started to increase contacts with individual investors, as well as the characteristics of the Chinese market, due to lower barriers to entry. "
    The vast majority of new financial exhibitors are P2P companies. Reporters Statistics found that, P2P financial products in general threshold level in one hundred thousand, for the urban middle class groups. Annual yield of more than 10% of P2P everywhere, even some reached 18%. But many industry insiders believe that the risks should not be underestimated.
    Reporters learned that many P2P behind the company, are specific investment projects, such as plant expansion or mine development. Since most SMEs can not through conventional financial financing, so the route through P2P platform. P2P platform after the audit, which approved the project will be packaged into a public sale of financial products. Therefore, the nature of many financial products are P2P debt.
    At 25, the People's Bank made clear red P2P companies, including financial - capital pool mode, raising the risk of unqualified borrowers and lead to illegal Ponzi scheme. In the Expo site, P2P companies focus on the most publicity, it is the safety and legality.
    Reporters consulting about ten P2P companies, these companies have said that the investors' money deposited in a regulated third-party platform, avoiding platform "illegal deposit-taking."
    For asset security issues of concern to investors, the majority of P2P companies to take physical security or debt repurchase, only a few companies are fully secured by a security company. Even the debt buyback, P2P companies set up "protection money" relatively limited scale. Once the project is in crisis, P2P difficult to cope with a large number of companies honored. Therefore, P2P financial security audit and risk control more dependent on the level of the platform.
    Alternative investments growing rise
    Data show that the personal assets of more than 6 million yuan nationwide there are about 280 million people, there are about 6.45 million people billionaires. For high net worth groups, their way of managing money has become a focus of attention. "Hurun" Report survey shows that investment in the field of high net worth population in general is the first real estate, stocks second, third alternative investments.
    In - the "Shanghai Money Fair Wealth Management and Alternative Investment Forum", "Hurun" Hoogewerf said people founded in 2008, is the most serious financial crisis, and China's alternative investment just started, which Artwork ranked first investment in the high net worth population, 65% of people say that want to invest in art, then the wine, watches.
    Although a wide range of alternative investments, but the risk can not be underestimated, particularly in alternative investments in China is still in the initial stage. In this regard, Hoogewerf suggested, "at least to consider alternative investments of about seven years, more than seven years to achieve an average return of more than 11% while many fakes alternative investments, such as red wine."
    Hoogewerf also suggested, "If investors try alternative investments, they spend more time, and more interested to see personal preferences in the value of alternative investments."
