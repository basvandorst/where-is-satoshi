I had a question about if I incurred unnecessary fees when buying bitcoin the first time.
So I bought $26.50 worth of BTC, using Coinbase. (I used their app because using Coinbase through the Copay app hasn't worked, and nobody has been able to troubleshoot it, and I haven't been able to get help from Coinbase that hasn't been automated from their support chat on their site or through email.) After fees, I had $21.93 worth in my Coinbase account. After transferring to Copay, I received 20.29 worth of BTC.
Going from 26.50 to 20.29 means I've lost nearly 25% of my value just from buying it and putting it in my preferred wallet. Should I just not use Coinbase? I've heard Gemini has lower fees, but I used Coinbase because I thought that the Copay/Coinbase integration would make it easier to learn the ropes, but now that I get errors every time I suppose I could start to use another service. Is there anything else I should do to avoid losing about 23% of my BTC?
Thank you for any guidance.

Has anyone actually gotten help from writing them? Everything from their customer support chat to their email has been automated

So I have purchased Bitcoin using Coinbase. I wanted to use Copay as my wallet, but have an issue. When I click "Connect Coinbase Account", it takes me to a Coinbase url which explains all the permissions it needs. When I click "Authorize", the link doesn't work and the error message reads
"This site can’t be reached
The webpage at copay://coinbase?code=3756d82e78af107b9305097bad965aef55f028f45e0e20a942d382a46d0204aa&amp;state=SECURE_RANDOM might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.
ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME" 
Despite this, I get an email confirmation saying it's been paired, and yet my Bitcoin did not appear in my Copay wallet, and it still asks me to "Connect a Coinbase account" within the app. 
 
Does anyone else know what I should do? I emailed the support link, but then they auto-replied that they don't accept emails to them at email anymore, so they send me somewhere to fill out a request, which hasn't been replied to yet.
