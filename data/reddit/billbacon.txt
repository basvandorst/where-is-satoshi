To be fair, I think the core dev team thought everyone would actually *want* to use it. They didn't take in to account all of the people profiting off of a crippled network.

So in 5 years I'll have to download over 8TB to start a node and have the storage capacity to contain it. What benefit do I get from this? I think it's short sighted and time will tell.

I suspect sock puppet accounts and reddit pr firms are running some vote manipulation and it's getting worse.

As soon as it becomes predictable it will no longer be effective.

I noticed that sub has more activity than all other cryptocurrency subs put together and seems willfully ignorant. Is it all astroturf?
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:27:01
Wow. C'mon! 1.6 Terabytes is growth per year, not how much you have to download per year. You have to download the entirety of the blockchain to run a node.  It gets bloated really fast and it's not necessary to have all that garbage stored on the blockchain.

Is that your little brother rapping at the end?

Why do you predict 8k?
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:03:31
You can buy it from a crypto exchange such as Gemini. Mining takes specialized hardware to be worth it. If you hold a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, it's worth investing in a hardware wallet such as a trezor or nano ledger s.
I would start off with quickly googling random topics and take care to sift through the bullshit.

It's easy to say they should have increased the blocksize after what happened at the tail end of 2017, but 1mb blocks should have been enough had segwit been adopted by exchanges earlier and transaction spam wasn't an issue. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 05:21:04
At minimum bitcoin is a decentralized, global, trustless banking system and payment gateway. Assuming they can fix the scaling issues, people will use it. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:22:28
Second layer solutions like the lightning network can divide a bitcoin into smaller parts if something smaller than eight decimal places became useful. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:07:32
It sure seems like many whales can tank the price at will.
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:18:38
Hoping the recent segwit adoption by Coinbase and others is enough to make the spamming too costly to be effective.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:28:02
I'm aware there are better solutions than iptable rules but it's a good place to start and has worked for me. I'll be surprised if LN nodes can't be hardened using the same techniques as web servers.

Don't worry,  and  can still have their coin giveaways.

I'm pretty sure they bought in at 20k

Wow. You're even more obnoxious than the people comparing bitcoin to tulips.

Most DDOS attacks are pretty easy to mitigate. You can add routing rules to identify and block the offending ips. Something like, if a client hits requests more than 40 times in 20 seconds, drop additional requests.  
A crappy raspberry pi node could probably be clobbered, but any halfway decent server should have no problem dealing with a ddos attack.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:18:48
You should really transfer your coins off the exchange as soon as you can. There is no need to trust them beyond small transfers to and from fiat. That's the great thing about crypto.

This really should be removed. It's pretty clear: "Submit a link NOT about price"

Yesterday I initiated a purchase during the dip. About an hour later, I got a message saying my purchase was declined by my bank. In fact, my bank never received a request. Coinbase cancelled the order. I went on today to re-initiate the order, hoping I havn't missed the dip, and I see that they are down. 
There are many things I could list but this is what was on my mind at the time I wrote that. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:07:22
They're down more often than not when the market gets active. It's unbelievable. I've seen them close trading repeatedly. I also watched minute by minute during the crazy BCash addition where they all but admitted to insider trading, claiming they would launch and internal investigation because it was undeniable. Yeah, it's to the point where I think the worst because I know they are not above it. Because they are sketchy.

The thing about Microsoft is that they usually stick with their products until they get them right. Their cloud platform is new. I imagine you'll have to give it some time to mature.

This is a typical crenulated consolidation pattern. This is an indication of trade bots working in opposition and will only break when the sell or buy bot give up their position. 
Not really.

Coinbase is so sketchy. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:19:57
I've used iptables rules to stop ddos attacks on web servers. It's always worked. Once the rules are in place it takes almost no cpusage to handle it.  
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:43:03
Well done. It's a good time to get in.
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:19:15
Technologically it's a pretty safe investment, but there are a ton of regulations that could stymie it. Like what BitLicense did to New York.
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:24:58
It's conflating the way software forks work with the way blockchain selects the next valid block. Even so, bcash loses on both counts.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:01:40
Bcash has done incredibly well with fraudulent branding, astroturf, insider trading, and network attacks. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:29:35
Wouldn't such an attack just be super obvious and ultimately result in an outing of those involved and a fork to redeem funds?

I sure hope the higher adoption of segwit is enough to make new blockchain spam attempts too expensive. It would be great to see an attempt thwarted.
@_date: 2018-04-21 08:00:39
I wonder how much of Kraken deciding not to comply has to do with the BitLicense shenanigans that ran crypto out of New York originally.

That looks ridiculous but I guess it makes sense. Just add shorts!

The biggest problem with Bcash is that they claim to be Bitcoin. It would be like if I made a fork of OpenOffice, recompiled with ads, and promoted it wherever people would otherwise find OpenOffice. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:55:15
Not one of those methods would destroy bitcoin. I was expecting something more along the lines of bcash scams or attacking the protocol at an isp level.
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:36:12
Something is very wrong. You can no longer buy BCH from bitcoin dot com but they have an instructional here:

Some of those bloated shitcoins with massive market caps make me uneasy.

That is a screencap I took from bitcoin dot com. I suspect they have taken the option down due to the recent attention.

Bcash didn't get consensus from the community to go in that direction. Without the majority support, it has no right to claim ownership of the brand. What Satoshi would do at this point is all speculation. Bcash has yet to implement a solution to transaction malleability.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:52:14
Oh, please. Is it okay to recompile an open source project with a bunch of ads and then market it as the real deal? I see no difference.  
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:44:17
Wouldn't this essentially enable ICOs in place of IPOs, doing away with a bunch of regulation?

It seems like they removed their option to purchase bch from bitcoin dot com but they left a screenshot of it at:

It makes no difference. It just stores the data in a different data structure, all on chain. The video does a good job of explaining it.

He's clearly in the bcash camp and hardly technical. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:46:54
They stopped selling bch on bitcoin dot com, but they haven't removed the instructions and actually have a screenshot of their old buy drop page.
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:15:16
Did they change it?
 
Note the screenshot on that page is nothing like the new purchase page.
in case they are serving different versions:
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:06:07
The fact they are hosting the screenshot on their "How to buy bitcoin cash" page seems pretty definitive.
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:53:00
It's nonsense. Zero conf and huge blocks is their answer to scaling. Still no malleability fix. It's a really effective marketing campaign with a bunch of sock puppets and scammers.

Market cap is just what the market is currently willing to pay per coin multiplied by the total number of coins in circulation. If I made "bsmarketcap" coin and gave away a 100 million of them and then sold a 100 for $10 each, I now have a market cap of a billion dollars. In reality, there is only $1k invested. I'm not sure about the 25x+ thing but the price will quickly drop as people try and cash out.
