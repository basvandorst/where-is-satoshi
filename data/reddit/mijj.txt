the correct response, before answering any questions is:
ask for their Full Name, Personal Address, If they are a Homeowner, Personal Telephone Number, Marital Status, Children, etc.. And request the same info of their immediate supervisor.  Advise that their posed questions will be answered (if judged unintrusive) after their info has been validated.  Also, there will be a small fee to cover the time expended and expenses of a professional validation of the information. (Assure them you are not a charity in the service of American Express)
Assure them that, if they are doing nothing wrong, they have nothing to hide.

not sure about the precision of terminology .. but ..
doesn't "fiat" money mean it can be created at will - ie. a product entirely of the imagination.  
Bitcoins (like gold) are constrained by reality independent of human imagination (ie. gold constrained by physical reality, Bitcoins constrained by reality of a mathematical kind).

another idea: hold down a banker and tattoo "bitcoin.org" on his forehead.
.. just a thought.

there was a time when the internet itself was a gimmick that had no particular use and only the tech minded bothered with it.  And now look at it - it's so important that there's a war by the establishment to crush free exchange of information and gather info on all users.

To borrow from an ancient Heiniken advert .. Bitcoin can reach those parts that state currencies cannot reach.
That's it's significance.
Eg. the US corporate state decided that Wikileaks should be choked of funds.  Bitcoin is a way to allow funding to continue.   All requests for donations for political (or other) causes should have an option to pay in Bitcoins.
Having said that, at the moment my interest in Bitcoin is academic - i still haven't figured a simple way to exchange UK state cash for bitcoins.

ahem .. the more influence something has that isn't fiat, the less influence fiat has.  Anyone whose power/position depends on the perpetual power of fiat will undermine anything that might, even in the smallest way, hint at diverting power away from fiat. They don't need to understand it to know they need to destroy it.

I beg to differ .. i'll bet no end of people will sell you 1 Bitcoin for 2.

it was actually created by Sidney Braithwaite - a Grimsby fishmonger.  He discovered the instructions on an alien cereal box on his way home from work one night.

actually, Satoshi is a time travelling space wolf.

hmmm .. how could they stop the use of Bitcoin to buy stuff from China?

awful awful phrase.  There's no such thing except in a transitory or initial conditions sense.  It's a phrase that deceives.
A "free market" will always have players of differing influence. And their aim will always be to accumulate power and influence.  Alliances and conspiracies will occur. Power and influence will always accumulate to fewer and fewer players.  The end product of the "free market" process is dictatorial government by corporation/organized crime or whichever other kind of organization manage to claw ultimate power to itself.
.. after all, if you believe in evolution, it all started as "free market", and every regime that has existed is a consequence of it.

damn right! .. in fact, because your presence is their choice, you can present them with a massive bill for all the joy and pleasure you brought into their lives.  Or, alternatively, charge them for each hour that you've been held hostage.

The reality is: who controls it, owns it.  Ultimately, it doesn't matter what's written on pieces of paper.

If people somehow became convinced the hammer was invented as a murder weapon by a psychopath, would it suddenly cease to be useful for hammering nails?  Would the hammer be banned because of fears of a worldwide epidemic of murder by hammer?
For Bitcoin, the code and its behavior matters, not imagined personalities or imagined motives.  And, unlike the psychopathic trains of thought of the maniacs who create fiat, the code for Bitcoin is available for all to see.

the attempt to shut down ThePirateBay is like an attempt to shut down a Bitcoin exchange.  Shutting down bittorrent (how files are actually exchanged) itself is the parallel to shutting down Bitcoin.

found this:
Xendpay: "cheap" money transfers that aren't as good as they look
apparently, you get wolloped on the exchange rate (still better than bank, tho)
referenced as better:
no idea if they transfer to Bitcoin exchanges

one should always consider the US government to be a mafia organization.  It will do whatever it sees fit to protect its domain.  As Bitcoin becomes increasingly significant, there will be dirty attacks from all possible directions.
Is Bitcoin's operating infrastructure sound enough to withstand efforts to destroy it?

i think voiceofxp meant "edible".
The Daily Mail is more *edible* than the other rags.

.. wait a minute.  If we wait for the future to arrive, then Bitcoin will be the *now* of currency .. won't it?

ooo! .. i dunno.  The Dark Knight operates to crush opposition to centralist establishment forces.
Bitcoin is the Joker (stripped of the negative propaganda). The Joker is, after all, the Lord of Light.  He is the essence of free will and free expression.  The reason he's a "bad guy" is propaganda carefully designed to make us yearn for central, authoritarian control.
