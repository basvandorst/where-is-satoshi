Very interesting, I have spent time in Australia (lived there) and found banking and the business environment to be a PITA and years behind the US in general (no offence). This is an interesting feature that you've mentioned though... I certainly don't have that ability with any of the banks I deal with.

Props to Ernie Allen for seeming to have done his homework on what exactly "virtual currencies" are(read: BTC).

Thank you, for the advice. I  have set a time horizon to sell based on my analysis on BTC, rather than a specific price point. Basically I'll be crying when this specific time comes. It will either be tears of joy or sadness (but not regret).

This is correct.

Thank you for your comment, I can tell you are speaking form experience. I have also been in the same boat before and realize that I am a crap daytrader of any commodity or security. At one point, I seriously considered creating some sort of wealth advisory practice where I'd advise clients on what stock I'm about to buy so that they can short it when it goes down. 
Anyway, it would not be fun to lose that amount of money however I haven't lost sleep yet over it. Time will tell but I intend to stay put for quite some time.

Multiple smaller buys, and yes dollar cost averaging as much as possible although the effect was not significant due to the short time frame of the purchases.

You bet! Don't want to be associated with etc.. when the investment matures.

Its possible to track what address you're coin came from if you're buying from a person but using an exchange it more difficult if not impossible. I don't know the originator of the coins I bought but they came from a miner at some point and were funneled through an exchange to me. The proof of ownership is your ability to spend them.

Overwhelmingly positive so far.

Thanks everyone for the welcome and well wishes. I'm a newb to posting in this sub but have been a lurker for a looong time so I do know a think or two about cold storage etc. Diversification is key when it comes to storage.

Your friends have open minds.

This is actually one of my wishes... avoid any sort of exchange fees.

You can register for an exchange or multiple exchanges and buy them there. Its a process though...
