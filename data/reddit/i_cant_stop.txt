As an immigrant to the US from the Netherlands I understand this just fine, thank you. And I still do not understand how you would put it on the same level as countries with ongoing genocides and unfounded levels of control over its citizens. It is still a good place to call home compared to many countries.

There are many problems with the US but it is crazy to put it on the same level as China

You’re right, and the majority of us are scared of the current president. I think for the majority here the issue is a mix of hope and apathy rather than fear. Depending on how things go over the next year that could change though. I think you are spot on with the issues of nationalism

It was, but English is my primary now. That is interesting you think I might not be able to find my home country on a map.
The US prison system is certainly an issue and there are widespread political movements to rebuild this system from the ground up. What is the main difference between these prisons and those in China, for example? The US is not rounding up citizens for forced labor and organ harvesting, which you conveniently ignored.
Lastly, that is a perfectly fine argument in my mind. I agree with all these issues you list, and more, which was the point of my original comment. Now to expand on it - I do not fear for the safety of my family. I do not fear being pulled into service of war. I will have no trouble finding economic success in the foreseeable future. I also believe that the population of citizens still hold power and the ability to create change, change that I very much hope is underway because this is the main right being threatened around the world today as we are seeing unfold before us in places like Hong Kong, where my wife’s family is from/lives.
