Looks like you are smart.
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:37:20
Your a fuckin liar. I sent tether through your wallet exchange offered to a FREEWALLET BITCOIN ADDRESS! which YOU control the private keys and as far as I know FREEWALLET BTC IS NOT SEGWIT! Freewallet is a huge scam to separate people from their BTC. And I will continue to warn newbies about the scam you are running.
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:49:05
Same thing happened to me but I was lucky very lucky
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:06:48
The expert YouTube T/A guy's and girls are so hilarious.
@_date: 2018-08-02 11:12:12
I indicated that I did use your scandalous cross exchange like I have for the past year, and sent coins to freewallet BTC after using your cross exchange lol. I can't wait until the proper authorities shut you thieves down because more people WILL be ripped off by you and I will patiently be waiting, so again, go FUCK YOURSELF! ����������������������
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:59:34
Same thing as what moms thinks you do
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:31:34
Who cares. Can't wait for the BTC black hole to start sucking these attacks up, we won't need stinking ETF's.
@_date: 2018-08-27 18:31:57
As soon as a democrat crashes the economy
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:03:46
I hear the heard.
@_date: 2018-10-10 02:43:05
Cold card too.
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:36:39
Satoshi doesn't need a centralized award.
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:38:18
@_date: 2018-10-20 22:13:33
So in other words: Buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:06:07
ATM's are cheaper than that bro
@_date: 2018-10-10 02:38:34
They wish.
@_date: 2018-10-26 14:01:03
Bad news for the bankers.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:25:44
All hail the king BTC!
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:12:54
Good for you and god speed. Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-10-26 13:52:47
They are trying to take people's BTC don't fall for it. We don't and will never ever need master card, we've done just fine with out them.
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:03:40
With or without ETF's, Master cards, futures, or whatever we're coming, and nothing or nobody can stop us.
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:20:37
They can't do it forever.
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:36:57
Nothing will happen.
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:08:07
Cardinal rule: never leave your BTC on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:46:17
They stole over $2200 from me and their answer to everything is to blame us there are already US attorneys probing this scam web wallet just hold on to your proof of being robbed. Do not use. If they have not robbed you yet rest assured that they will. Good luck and thanks for the informative post
@_date: 2018-06-11 05:03:31
Yeah I can't wait BTC always wins and I'm pretty confident it always will, it's like a living organism that will grow and swallow the opposed and greedy in due time.
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:11:42
I hope my wife doesn't see this

They stole over $2000 in tether from my tether freewallet, I used the exchange that they provide in the wallet and instantly lost $1900 in tether when they only deposited 4 cents worth of BTC, so I tried to use another input wallet and it did the same thing 4 cents for $60 in usdt, tried other wallets including their own btc wallet and the same thing happened 4 cents BTC with just sending the minimum amount required by freewallet. I have sent over 6 support tickets with proof/screenshots with the error happening with their system with no lick of luck of retrieving my funds. I have proof of the scam that was done to me and I bet many other people and these people just don't care, I imagine that in the future there will be a huge market of lawyers that will retrieve funds for people in our situation if we have proof so make sure that you screenshot everything and quit using web wallets they are designed for one thing only and that's to rob people before regulations come for them.

Just don't ever cash out.
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:33:06
A few months? More like few weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:30:41
Great thread indeed, and at the very end of the day those big boys just want to get everyone's bitcoins cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:53:43
Sorry I was completely wrong, I should have said days.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:15:23
Lol there are so many ways to not pay the strong armed robbery that are taxes
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:04:12
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:52:28
Satoshi your fired!��
@_date: 2018-11-11 02:06:39
Used miners.
@_date: 2019-01-12 00:46:07
2365 looks like a future price target
@_date: 2019-01-28 16:04:46
Very good, but we still have a loooooong way to go
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:28:51
You too asshole
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:53:58
Hold on to that software program that is BTC for dear life!
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:26:42
Read my post again you stupid mother fucking newbie, I said "1 Satoshi will be LIKE $100 dollars" the main word is LIKE which also refers to a comparison you dumb FUCK you.
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:13:26
Not rumors very true, I had a first batch L3+ and when I got it I took it apart and verified dust on the boards. Bitmain is a total rip off hopefully this Bear market lasts another 2 or 3 mabe 4  yrs to kill these bastards.
@_date: 2019-01-26 00:03:10
Yeah I got it from your mother
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:33:30
Don't sweat it DEVS are already on it, and BTC when the time comes will simply run on QTC's.
@_date: 2019-01-26 00:05:27
Yeah I did, one of them was your mother that bitch had a dick
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:43:28
BTC isn't an investment opportunity though.
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:27:09
�� ��
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:01:27
Well it basically just cost your understanding of the currency/technology and realizing that it's not an investment in the traditional sense but a voluntary transfer of your wealth into another currency based on your beliefs and expectations on the technology. Good luck to us all.
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:08:30
Sweet thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:45:52
In 50 Years.
@_date: 2019-01-25 22:24:07
Your thinking in $ don't do that. Think in BTC decimals.
@_date: 2019-01-25 20:52:00
WRONG! One Satoshi will become like hundred dollar bills! ��

@_date: 2017-09-04 21:52:23
I don't get it
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:32:19
Been doing that for a very long time
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:00:36
Can I use my old direct TV satellite?? 
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:11:46
You obviously don't understand BTC 
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:50:05
50 months is cool.��
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:20:14
Bitcoin is going to $0 one day in a good way, and when that happens holders will be able to buy a 2 yr old used very nice car for example for about: 0.0027 btc. But in the meantime, don't quit your day job.
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:00:16
It should say "Monetary Black Hole" at the very top.
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:33:27
Black holes swallow galaxies.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:53:23
The D should have been DigiByte.
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:42:57
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:54:37
You should be able to send back the coins I sent to freewallet btc since you control the private keys. Send me my funds now asshole!
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:12:13
The Bitcoin Black Hole will be devastating for institutions.��������������������!
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:54:30
Let the Futures, ETF BS happen. These are obviously attacks on big daddy BTC to keep the monetary black hole from appearing for right now, but rest assured these tactics will go out of style along with the new altcoins that will dethrone big daddy BTC and we'll be laughing all the way to the BTC ATM!
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:07:55
Trump should pardon Ross now!
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:10:42
Try to find an ATM they usually charge an 8- 10% fee but it confirms pretty quick especially with a blockchain mobile wallet or mycillium (I don't know if I spelled that right) but anyway it's the best way I feel more comfortable this way..
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:32:38
Sweet! Except the selling your portfolio part.
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:35:01
Did that 3 yrs ago
