If you remove the opinions of all those that can not differentiate between loosing and losing then a more accurate assessment can be formed. 
Remember this in your decision making process and you will go far.
There are some reasonable points contained within his rant but they alone are not reasonable grounds to lose faith in bitcoin. There are many errors and straw men too.
The self confession regarding the fact he does not own any bitcoin is not for certain guiding his negativity but that is also a consideration.
My best advice to him would be to buy some and then take a look at it all again from a different angle. You will then make come to a more sensible and grounded opinion that there is a high probability of bitcoin reaching 100k USD by 2021.
The more serious and insulting allegation is that my costume is silly.
