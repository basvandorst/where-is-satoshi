Imagine sending something in the mail to someone, the delivery guy will get paid for taking it to its destination. Imagine if you wanted to change the content of the message in the mail or the destination you can 'bribe' the delivery guy to overwrite it. The delivery guy gets paid regardless but his incentive is to take the 'bribe'.
This is not the best analogy but it gets the basics across.

They will probably implement Segwit before Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:24:50
If you have small amounts in UTXO's it can be expensive but through consolidation and using tech like Segwit you can avoid a lot of the fees. 
I sent my Bitcoin to a Segwit address when Trezor supported it and I avoided a lot of the fees we see today. If you are a late adopter of tech you will be punished, I'm not saying this is the case in your circumstance.
Once Schnorr Signatures are here HD wallets will benefit greatly.

If you send a transaction that double spends the first miners usually discard it since mining a block with both tx's would be invalid. Miners will decide to replace the first transactions with the newest transaction that has a higher fee. It's quite good if you want to send a transaction that is really low priority without worrying it will get stuck.
I will probably use RBF to consolidate my transactions with a low fee and hope they get included when the mempool allows for it, if not I can up the fee.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:35:44

@_date: 2018-01-13 21:17:59
I believe its 2 transactions between 2 people so 1 each. Either party is anticipating paying another fee if the other party tries to steal the funds but game theoretically that doesn't make sense.

Replace By Fee. It allows you to make a transaction that double spends an unconfirmed transaction such that the fee is greater so the miner includes the higher fee one instead.
CPFP is related it stands for Child Pays For Parent so you can make a transaction that depends on another transaction to be confirmed so that its more beneficial for a miner to include both transaction.

Lightning Network is being implemented as well as Sidechains/Drivechains.
Lightning Network can do 1000x more transactions per second, the confirmation times are instant, and the transactions are anonymised.
`Sidechain/Drivechain = SC/DC`
SC's/DC's are a bit like altcoins in that they can have different qualities to Bitcoin. SC's/DC's differ from altcoins by being 'pegged' to Bitcoin so that you can send your Bitcoin to the SC/DC and do transactions on that Network which will reduce the strain that Bitcoin's Network is currently under.
SC's/DC's are not permanent scaling solutions because you can't increase the block size indefinitely but there are things like MimbeWimble in development that solve the block size problem really well.
Lightning is likely to be the medium exchange tool people use next year since it's so close to being released.

There will be no fork.
Forks create a new coin since it changes the network rules in an incompatible way. Lightning Network is a layer 2 scaling solution.
It's like the layers of protocols that make the internet work. A fork would be like creating a brand new network that doesn't speak with the existing ecosystem.
Layered solutions are by far better since the currency doesn't change.

[Here]( is the thread. �� 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:40:40
Lightning will help with future transaction throughput. If you are someone who makes a lot of transactions then you could open a Lightning Payment Channel which will allow you to pay anyone else in the Lightning Network. You only need to open and close the channel on the Blockchain. So as long as you do more than two transactions over Lightning then you will have reduced the backlog of transactions in the Mempool.
A good use case for Lightning Networks are for exchnages. If you buy some Bitcoin on an exchange and send it to your wallet you could use a Lightning wallet so that only your first transaction is on the Blockchain. From that point onwards fees would be 0 for withdrawing from exchange.
You only need to open a new payment channel if there isn't a route between you and someone you are trading with.
A lot of people think this is a problem but I think this will be business as usual eventually. We are just not used to having the mempool filled with transactions but since there is only a limited space per block the solution is to move as much off-chain as possible.
Please correct me if anything I said was incorrect.

@_date: 2017-12-18 20:23:53
its not always the highest sat/byte transactions that get in the mempool. Just a skim through block  shows that a 75 sat/byte transaction made it in. 
So you can't go based on the mempool always since there is a combination of factors.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:32:08
The risk for the other party is that you can withdraw all of their Bitcoins from the contract.
As far as I know this can only happen between connected peers and cannot be done through routing. If it can be done with infinite 'distance' across the network then it could be a problem.
I actually think Lightning would be better if it was built on top of a Sidechain so that there are 2 layers of abstraction so that fees for settling are even lower.

- This pattern probably continues for the next few blocks.

The days of getting transactions to confirm within 10 minutes are over. If you want to trade frequently then keep some of your Bitcoin on an exchange, do that at your own risk.


Look at [this]( to see how prioritised your transaction is.
If you don't know how many sat/byte your transaction is just paste the transaction ID into a block explorer and it will show you.
The higher sat/byte your transaction is the more likely it will be confirmed.
Hopefully with Lightning Network coming out soon you should be able to transact instantly but as a community we will have to convince exchanges to adopt Lightning.

Probably not.


That may be true and thats why its better to own Bitcoin because its not within the central banks control. I have no idea what their policy will be in 2 weeks but I can predict Bitcoins economic policy in 100 years.

I'm less enthusiastic about RSK because it just brings Ethereums attack surface to Bitcoin. There are probably better, more intelligent solutions than just copying a failed technology.

Fork.lol estimates the total amount of hashes to be `808,783,245,725,529,475,309,895,680`.
    808,783,245,725,529,475,309,895,680 (hashes) * 32 (bytes) = 25,881,063,863,216,943,209,916,661,760 (total bytes)
I'm pretty sure sha256 hashes are 32 bytes each.

I think you should be fine against quantum computing attacks as long as your address has not been reused (most wallets do this automatically). Although you never know what kind of security exploits you might need to protect yourself against. :)

RSK sucks, its basically just bringing Ethereums attack surface onto Bitcoin.

As the energy of the system increases, the security of the system increases. I suspect that the energy being used to mine Bitcoin is probably energy that would otherwise be wasted anyway, the reason why thats probably true is because the margins for profitability are so small. You need the cheapest electricity in the market otherwise other miners will out compete you.

I think that knowledge gap will close like how the internet closed the knowledge gap. A lot of people think it's generational for some reason and it's actually not. I saw a poll done on bitcointalk and most people where in their like 30's - 40's.
When I say Bitcoin goes up in value his "rebuttal" is  "so does gold". Sometimes feels like i'm talking to Peter Schiff. He has uncertainty on how Bitcoin is backed. He thinks the government can stop/control it.

To say your fee's are 20% of the transaction is misleading.
Fee's are not dependant on how much you are sending. You could have sent $200,000,000 and the fee's would be the same.
Be patient and wait for the lightning network before doing payments where the fee's make up 20% of the payment.

@_date: 2017-08-24 17:32:19
They are determined by users and miners. Users send a transaction with a fee. Miners will fit as many transactions they can into a block, and will prefer the highest "satoshi per byte" transactions. If you want to get your transaction mined in the next block you have to set the fee high, since you are competing with other users for that place.
If you set a low fee your transaction will be in the mempool waiting to be mined. But it will get mined eventually. I heard of a transaction for 1¢ with a 1¢ fee and it got mined eventually.
If a miner wanted too he could only put transactions with 0 fee into blocks but the economic incentive to take the highest fee's is so high.

As long as everyone doesn't assume "Someones probably working on it" then at least one person will not assume that and actually start working on it.

I watch Andreas a lot and he has a lot of left leaning view points. It's rare to hear them but once in a while a small amount of it shines through. Which I think is great, when he talks about Bitcoin he leaves politics at the door.

The reason block sizes are not sustainable is because the size of the blockchain gets away from you very fast. Do we really want to have 5TB blockchains?
We have testnets and Litecoin is basically an activate and see for Bitcoin. Which I think is great. Test it until you cannot test it anymore put it on Litecoin and see how it works. If it works Bitcoin will adopt it.
I don't fear hard forks. I just don't want to needlessly hard fork all the time.
I'm not saying block increases will not increase the capacity I just don't think its the optimum solution. I bet when they fork for s2x they will do it on the bitcoin blockchain and not the bcash blockchain. Gotta get that 10% BTC amirite?

I hope this works but I cannot see me buying a coffee and them saying it will be 150 microbits. It seems a bit complicated for the people who don't know math that well. I agree that bit is a bit more confusing because it makes other denominations not make sense as millibit is larger than a bit. If we where to use names for denominations then it would have to be significant figures in Bitcoin such as Satoshi or Hal Finney, I have seen people wanting to use 'Finney' as 1/10,000,000 of a Bitcoin. I recon there is still a while before this would be useful though.
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:52:58
I heard in a talk that the LN could be set up such that you can extend the life of a payment channel avoiding paying a settlement fee. The channels could be up for weeks, months or even years. The price of bitcoin should increase with the halving such that the miners can depend on the block rewards. You make some good points but I think these issues are not that big and will be ironed out over time.

Block size increases are simply not sustainable. The blockchain is already huge. I actually didn't say it had to be complicated that was you putting words in my mouth.

I don't like the idea of hard forks and would much prefer extended blocks.

Don't worry. You'r question is perfectly reasonable. From my understanding this is how it works. When you sign a transaction it is added to the meme pool. Anyone can independently check that. So as a merchant I know you have $X dollars to spend otherwise you could not have signed the transaction. What I don't know is if you have already spend that $X. That's where confirmations are needed.

No one can take skills away from me and I hope that my investment in Bitcoin will motivate me to learn more and more.

If LN payment channels life can be extended then the need to go back on chain will not be necessary at least until you want to have your payments confirmed. I am not saying LN will be the end of the debate but increasing block size is so lazy. The size of the blockchain just gets out of control to fast.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:33:19
How would it work? Does it make it so each subsequent block is a MimbleWimble block after a HF/SF?

The actual block size is 2mb.

The Lightning Network allows people to transact Bitcoins for free. What you do is open a payment channel on the Lightning Network which will cost the usual Bitcoin fee but once you have that connection you can transact as much as you like basically for free. The only time you have to pay a tiny fee is when you want to send someone money you don't directly have a channel open with. The fees on the network will be less and less the more people use it since it's not like mining where it costs a lot. At the end you close the channel and your final balance is recorded on the blockchain.
It's a bit like having a bar tab. The potential is huge. The amount of transactions per second are on the order of millions/billions. There are two types of forks, hard forks and soft forks. Hard forks we stay away from because it causes things like Bitcoin Cash. Soft forks make upgrades without 'splitting' bitcoin. The update is locked in and will be activated this month.
Go to lightning.network for more info.
That was a messy explanation but it should be enough to get you started.

From my understanding the code was poorly thought out and granted users access to functions they should not have been given. RSK will likely have the same problems but only specific smart contracts can be broken into and not the underlying system (i think). If you dont wish to use it you don't have to so you could just ignore RSK.

@_date: 2017-08-11 14:57:50
I never understood that. It only makes sense to do it that way if you have no savings.
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:46:07
Fee's are fixed. They do not depend on how much you are transacting. If it takes $2 fee for your transaction to be confirmed then it doesn't matter if your sending $9 or $9,000,000. This is actually a good thing because it means if we use Lightning Network and open payment channels we will not have to pay a percentage of the transaction but instead a fixed price.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:08:22

@_date: 2017-08-09 19:14:27
I hope they adopt Bitcoin but they have the right to create their own blockchain based currency but given that it took governments decades to build decent websites I recon their versions will be much worse than Bitcoin if they go down that route.
If they did make their own blockchain based currency I hope people don't think "Why would I buy Bitcoin for $3000 when I can get CanadaCoin for $100". I feel like this could be a problem in the future when mainstream adoption happens.
I seen Andreas talking with the Senate and they are very understanding and you can tell they are genuinely interested unlike the US with their huge ego's.
Good luck Australia.

I think crypto would suffer from the internet going down but it's important to realise Bitcoin is not dependant on the internet. It's just information so you could make a transaction completely offline, send it over radio waves and so long as a node is listening it will get propagated through the network. Of course the internet is the best platform for sending information but it's in principle possible to have no access to internet.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:08:14
The number of Bitcoin transactions is artificially capped. The video makes it seem like it's a limitation of the technology.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:38:42
I'm sure they just wait for a verification, which is instant. It looks like a small store so I recon they would just reject customers that abuse the system.

The keys are the seed (12-24 words).

@_date: 2017-08-01 23:06:52
Where have you been?
When Bitcoin forked it created two Bitcoin's. One is called Bitcoin and other other Bitcoin Cash (BCash). If you own Bitcoin you have the same amount in BCash, so long as you have control over the private keys. Some exchanges allow you to use BCash but not all. If you keep your money on an exchange then you don't own your own keys which means you likely won't have access to BCash. If you have own keys then you can spend that BCash.
Unless you know what you are doing you should just sit back and watch it play out. I don't recommend you spend or receive Bitcoin or BCash until this whole situation is more clear. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:32:45

I should probably set up a litecoin one as well. I never touched testnet, but I would like to build some applications for LN and would be interested to know if it has a JSON-RPC like Bitcoin does.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:22:24
Lets not pretend that Bitcoin cannot be anonymous. The latest update will give us the Lightning Network. Since each node in the LN only has one hop information no one will know who paid who. If MimbleWimble is implemented then we could have an anonymous blockchain (sidechain) which would increase anonymity and require less storage capacity.
But your right. Right now Bitcoin is not anonymous and if you want it to be you have to jump through a number of hoops.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:50:15
I dont understand your last point. I know they have 8mb blocks. Like you said s2x could do a soft fork on bcash instead of hard forking bitcoin which is what they will do if it moves forward.
You never seen spam in the mempool? people could easily spam the 8mb block size. It goes way past 8mb on bitcoin all the time.

The hashing power will be less but the network does not require a certain amount of hashing power. If the hashing power decreases so does the difficulty. That's why the network could run on CPU's. We didn't move to GPU's because we had to but because there was economic incentive.

When people sell bitcoin they actually tend to buy another crypto-currency that way you don't have to deal with bullshit capital gains tax.
If you fear that bitcoins price will drop just put it in litecoin which is much more stable compared to Bitcoin.

I would have liked to own a whole bitcoin because it would be very satisfying but tbh it doesn't really matter. Soon we will be using mBTC or bits.

Couldn't you encode a transaction id in the message of the transaction such that the sensors at the door would only go off if the ID matches an item that hasn't been paid for. You wouldn't need to confirm it since it could still get the necessary data from the mempool. I'm just thinking out loud here.
To recap: I scan QR code and send funds. The QR code automatically sets the message that will be send to the mempool and eventually blockchain. The store owner is running their own node where they can update the items in stock depending whether or not they see the item id in the mempool/blockchain.

The genesis block was hard-coded into the code because the consensus rules require that you put the hash of the previous block in the header.
Block | Date
0 | 2009-01-03 18:15:05
1 | 2009-01-09 02:54:25

I imagine the packaging is the same as the packaging for the old Trezor. When you try to unbox it the box is a mess because it's incredibly difficult to open. This means you cant just reseal it after.
To my knowledge there is no self destruct feature. The device itself locks after a couple of incorrect password inputs. 
I am talking about the original Trezor and I don't actually have the new version.

Well your here so thats a good start! :)
If you want to learn about Bitcoin start with Andreas Antonopoulos, he is fantastic: 
He has been on Joe Rogan's podcast if you like him. He has 2 books on Bitcoin 1 for laymen and 1 for developers.
World Crypto Network: 
They have a diversity of views. They typically have a presenter, an professional trader and a Bitcoin Core Developer.
If you want to buy Bitcoin I use Coinbase where you can buy Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Don't be intimidated by the terminology I learn something new everyday. 
You need to learn security so Andreas's videos should help with that. Bitcoin's motto is "Not your keys, Not your Bitcoin", you should understand this before you buy Bitcoin. Any money you keep on an exchange you risk being stolen, any money you risk keeping on your phone/computer you risk being hacked. To overcome this I bought a TREZOR which is a highly secure hardware device.
Hope this helps :)

Yes. Write it down on paper and store it somewhere...

For buying things no one needs to know your address, you need to know THEIR address. If you want to receive Bitcoin from someone they will need to either scan your QR-code or copy/paste the address.


I don't understand your question. I have an iPhone and a Trezor and I don't think the Trezor supports iPhones. Keep that in mind when buying one.

I'm not u/shreveportfixit but I don't want big blocks because it centralises the miners. Miners are already extremely centralised and I don't want it to get worse. Since censorship resistance and security is the most important thing in Bitcoin I don't want to risk it for a temporary solution to high fees.
Bigger blocks mean we are scaling linearly which is pretty bad. Linear scaling is worth it only if there isn't much of a trade of but in this case the trade off is huge.
We can scale with SegWit, Schnorr Sigs, MAST, Lightning and Sidechains.

Although this assumes the price would remain the same even though more money is entering the ecosystem. If the price per coin doubles in the next halving (for simplicity) that means it would remain at $12.6M being created each day.
Any more than $12.6M being invested would result in the price of Bitcoin going up and the value of the minted coins would also increase. It would be interesting if there was a function for expressing this.
Correct me if I am wrong.

In a trezor you go to their website and plug your trezor into your computer. There is a tab for receiving Bitcoin, you click it and it shows your QR code(s).
I imagine the process is similar with any other hardware wallet.
Look for some videos online about the device you want.


Most crypto-currencies have different address structures except forks of Bitcoin.
I don't use Ethereum so I can't vouch for how well integrated it is into Trezor.


You can. The Trezor allows you to generate addresses without plugging in your Trezor. To send Bitcoin you **need** to plug in your Trezor.
It's better if you generate a new address each time you receive Bitcoin for security, and privacy.


If you are mostly on a laptop, or desktop it's not an issue. All I need to do is open a website.
If your primary device is your phone I'm not sure how well this will work for you.

I wonder if you could do Lightning on top of RSK. That way opening and closing of payment channels would be even cheaper since there would presumably be larger blocks. I don't think users need to settle transactions on RSK instead I think the chain as a whole is settled periodically on the mainchain. &lt;- 
If it has bigger blocks it will be slightly more centralised but if you can leave your funds on there and they act just like a regular blockchain that would be really promising. Users will have to do the cost benefit analysis themselves whilst keeping the liquidity in Bitcoin.

If a sufficient amount of miners switch to the S2X chain it means blocks will be extremely slow on the main chain or may stop altogether.
I doubt this will happen for a number of reasons:
The more miners that mine the S2X chain the less profitable it will be for them and since they have to split the profits between each other. The future markets show the price of S2X is 0.2 of Bitcoin I doubt they will be able to profit of that chain alone.
I think the economic incentive for miners will keep them in cheque, if S2X has the consensus they claim to have it will be a slow transition to that chain and the original Bitcoin chain will not die.


I guess it's the high profile of the supporters. There was an agreement amongst some companies to 'upgrade' Bitcoin and thats what this fork is.


This is the attack vector people are concerned about. We will find out what happens when the fork happens.

1.04842249 BTC is in a wallet Coinbase has the keys to. You own 1 BTC of that so when Coinbase made a transaction they sent you 1 BTC which you own and gave themselves the change of 0.4805506 BTC.
Even though the transaction has fees its only 0.00036743 BTC and it looks like Coinbase paid those fees since you got your 1 BTC.

Not really. They are only worth what someone is willing to pay. It's not like fiat money where newly created cash is to be treated the same as older cash.
Plus when forks happen everyone gets the new coins. Which is different from printing money because everyone looses money when more fiat is printed.

I always wondered if you could run Lightning on top of Sidechains. From my understanding syncing a Sidechain to Bitcoin requires a lot less space than settling **everyones** payment channel on the main blockchain.
I heard MimbleWimble can have Lightning run on top of it and if MimbleWimble can be a Sidechain that could make for an amazing combination of technologies.

Well you where misled. The high fees where due to spamming on the network. The fees for Bitcoin right now are so small. BCH cannot scale unless they adopt SegWit which Bitcoin has already done. SegWit allows for 1000x transactions per second increase once Lightning comes out. Not to mention sidechains where you could have an 8mb block size so BCH will be pretty useless at that point.

Renewable energy tends to produce an excess of energy, overtime this energy is eaten up because overtime humans use more and more energy.

What you are talking about is a snapshot and thats what "Bitcoin Private" did. It was recently discovered that someone inflated the supply by millions of coins during the creation of the snapshot.
We could do that but new nodes joining the network would not be able to fully validate the authenticity of the chain. Its not a good idea, better to keep the blocksize at a manageable level and hope computation and bandwidth speeds make the IBD bearable.

If Luno holds the keys the customer and retailer could put trust in Luno but that exposes you to counterparty risk. I actually don't think it's expensive at all for double spends to occur, all I think it required it that you send two transactions in the time a block is being mined
- one to the shop
- the second to yourself
And only one can be included in the next block since they use the same coins (they are conflicting). I am not sure how this is done technically. The shop would see you sent a transaction but when you left the shop you could double spend it to yourself.
I really ought to look into the technical details of how all this happens.

Bitcoin mine? As in computers that mine Bitcoin? It wouldn't be that hard to setup a computer to mine Bitcoin but I wouldn't expect anything interesting to happen especially if you don't mine in a pool. Mining is hard and requires a lot of computing power.
I don't think you have to go to far into the details of the programming but you could show the github activity for Bitcoin which would be quite interesting to look at. Github has a lot of analytics and that could pad your report.
In terms of the math I think the best thing you could do is learn about the Bitcoin cryptography and find simple math analogies that explain whats going on in terms more people like your teacher can understand.
It's achievable to do this report but it does require that you learn about Bitcoin. If you have an understanding of programming, Andreas Antonopoulos did a bit on Bitcoin Scripting This is not necessarily cryptography but interesting non the less.

Think of the private key exactly like it sounds. It's just a physical key. It can be copied. Digital keys can be encoded to look differently, my Trezor encodes the private key into 24 english words (a 'seed') that I can back up however I like.
I don't have the Ledger so I don't know exactly how you mess around with the private keys on those devices. I am sure they have a blog like Trezor does so I recommend you read up on any material you can find. If any fork happens they will likely release updates on exactly what to do.
You only actually need to transfer your private key on another device if your ledger doesn't support the hard fork which is unlikely. Remember once you redeem your coins on a mobile app your BTC and BTC(forked coin) would be on that device which is not a good place to have your money. If I did this I would stop using that private key and create a new account on the Ledger so I knew no one knew it.
If I made any mistakes someone will correct me.

Just feels like you are giving them a lot of slack for something that has been in the works for years. Ok fair enough they didn't know it was going through but what about those 2016 blocks we waited for lock-in, and the other multiple phases SegWit went through in order to be introduced on the network. It wasn't a sure thing when the first SegWit transaction went through, it was a sure thing probably days before that occurred.

The time delay between planets isn't a problem for transactions but its a problem for mining.

But with Lightning there is no reason for the exchange to hold your coins once you have a payment channel open. 
- I pay £10 to Coinbase
- Coinbase gives me £10 worth of BTC in Lightning wallet on Coinbase
- I open payment channel with Coinbase to get BTC
Now that the payment channel is open Coinbase can send to my address directly instead of holding them acting as a honey pot.
Also you don't need to open a payment channel with them directly if you can route your payment through previously opened payment channels.

What if when you buy Bitcoin's with fiat the exchange could just give you Bitcoins over The Lightning Network? That way you never touch the blockchain. I think you would need to touch it once to open a payment channel between your wallet and the wallet the exchange provides. Once you have it open they could send to you directly in the future.
Maybe there is a better way I am not thinking of right now.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:13:24
You could just fork Bitcoin and not allow coins to be spent from addresses from 2009. Is that a solution though?
I don't think it's as big of a problem as you do but the only solution is to make an altcoin. Why should the creator / early adopters of Bitcoin not profit from it?

@_date: 2018-02-10 06:05:26
I think this is slightly misleading. A lot of nodes on  have no open channels, just zoom out and you can see all of the dead nodes. I run my own node and I can't even see a couple of them because they are so old no nodes broadcast them to the rest of the network. We should discount all of the nodes without open channels.
Node count matters less than the ratio between nodes and channels so this isn't a hatred for Lightning in any way.

That's not how mining works. Your likelihood of mining a block is the same under the currently difficulty whether or not other miners participate.
If you mine 1% of the blocks before the fork you will mine 1% of the blocks if 99% of the miners leave under the current difficulty.
The only reason it might be more profitable is because the supply is 1% of what it was before and demand increases Bitcoins price.

The reason bitcoin is as valuable as it is is because of the ideology that it's based on. If PayPal uses blockchain that doesn't make it any more valuable other than it being slightly more secure. 
It's value comes from it being decentralised, permissionless, open source.

I don't use breadwallet but I suspect it function similar to the Trezor that I use and gives a new address to you each time it receives an input. Meaning that the address that you see is an address you can receive funds with but the address you sent money to is hidden so you don't send to it multiple times.
I am sure there is a function on the breadwallet that should show you all the addresses in your wallet and then you could send us the real address with funds in it.
I basically just reiterated what u/21000000000000000000 but that's just so you know he isn't just making shit up.
If there is no funds on the Blockchain.info link then that address has no funds, simple as that. It doesn't mean you don't have a different address with funds in it but this address is useless even if we could gain access.

If SHA256 was broken I guess, although we would have plenty of time to change because from my understanding hashing algorithms are not usually broken all at once.
Some bigger miners might not like this because it would require a total reboot of all their equipment, smaller miners might see this as a way to get a head.
Core would probably want a smooth transition, I don't have any good ideas on how that would be achieved.

Understanding the technology is the most important thing. You never fully understand Bitcoin because new developments happen all the time a bit like the Internet.


The origin of that word is quite hilarious!


It's funny seeing the goals of new investors change over time, it used to be 1 Bitcoin then 0.5 Bitcoins now 0.1 Bitcoins :P
I recommend you keep the amount of Bitcoins you own a secret. It's best for people reading this in the future to consider you a target. Who knows what 0.1 BTC will be worth one day.


Wise decision. Once you understand Bitcoin and realise where it's value comes from and why it has value then you will be much better off. Investing in Apple, Google or Facebook early on would have been really stupid if you didn't understand it even if you profited greatly from it.
The hardest thing to understand for me is NOT the technology but the game theory and economic incentives on all the different players in the ecosystem such as the relationship between:
Miners, Users, Exchanges, Wallets, Merchants and Developers.


Me and you both! :)

Why not stay on the side chain indefinitely? There's no time limit like there is with Lightning.
So long as people accept sidechain payments I don't see why you wouldn't just keep all your funds on the sidechain. 
If it's possible to set up Lightning in a way that you can setup payment channels between people on different chains that would be perfect as everyone is going to want instant low fee transactions and won't care which chain they came from.
We will have to see how this plays out though.

He seems to confuse transactions with blocks which I thought was to keep it simple for the viewer but then talks about cryptographic hashes.
He makes it seem like users are mining blocks which they are not in almost every case and he doesn't actually mention blocks he just says they are single transactions which can be true if you only mine a block without including other transactions. This seems like it would be more confusing than educational.

If Bitcoin can upgrade Banks should be able to upgrade. I don't know for a fact that you can change the data types since old nodes would see a different value in the time stamp and then the hash they get would be different.

You would never exchange Bitcoin in a tangible way. u/jurassic_balm makes it sound like you would I don't think it's intentional.
Using paper to store your Bitcoins is kinda like writing your email password on paper so you don't forget.

Ah, so I am guessing the solution to this puzzle is some kind of seed that will unlock the entire wallet. In which case your right. 
Solution 2:
If you try to find where in the breadwallet the other addresses are stored. In my Trezor it has a button that says "Show Previous" where it shows all my previous addresses used with that wallet. 
It would be worth while to do because you could prove there was actually money on the line.

Once we get Schnorr Signatures then I think this problem people have with many inputs will be resolved.

@_date: 2017-10-25 15:30:48
Do nothing. Make sure you are in control of the private keys. You will be able to split your coins easily if you hold them on a hardware wallet (assuming they have splitting functionality added). 
If you spend your Bitcoins without splitting there is a chance your transaction is played on both chains which is called a replay attack. So if you send 1 Bitcoin you will also send 1 B-2X coin. 
You are going to want to do more research on how to get access to coins on both chains since there are many different hardware wallets, software wallets and exchanges out there.

The problem with altcoins is that they need to catch up with Bitcoin. Then whilst they are catching up they need to keep up with current advances, then more advances are made which they need to keep up with.
In order to have an altcoin that is viable you need a development team as good as Bitcoin Core. There simply isn't enough Developers in this ecosystem that know enough about this stuff to have multiple projects on the bleeding edge of Computer Science.

I have learned something new about Bitcoin everyday for the past 6 months or so. I am a CS student so it helps me grasp the technical details but for most people understanding how transactions work is a lot of effort. 
My parents don't get it and the questions they ask about it are rather simplistic. I ought to show them how I make a transactions but I am more of a hodler.
This tech could scale to allow everyone to use it that has an internet connection and is accessible without an internet thanks to the satellite that was launched.
Adoption will happen very, very slowly then all at once.

That's a lot of the Cryptocurrency market to be fair. I only see Bitcoin and Litecoin being taken as payment regularly.
I only really care about the development team and that they are decentralised. Bitcoin has dozens of developers working on it from all over the world. Bitcoin is getting Smart Contracts, Sidechains, Lightning Network all because the developers are focussed on Bitcoin.
BCash sucks because it won't have what's stated above and even if it does somehow get those things it will then have to catch up with new development. There simply isn't enough developers specialised enough to do this on other coins.

You open a channel with someone well connected on the Lightning Network.
You deposit $100 into the payment channel, they can do the same. You can then send $1 to them for free in a trustless setup.
Now you have $99 and they have $101. Either party can close the channel at anytime although they are incentivised to keep it open.
Let's say I want to send Starbucks a payment buy I only have a payment channel opened with you. If you have a payment channel open with Starbucks then I can send you $1 to send to Starbucks and it's impossible for you to steal the money. You can take a fee but if you do you will get less traffic, a new fee market will come to life once the network is active.
You can make as many hops between the sender and recipient. Each node only know who they got the transaction from and who they are sending it to. They don't know information 2 hops in either direction making it way more anonymous on par with Tor anonymity.
Please learn more about Lightning before you talk trash about it. Ignorance is a choice.

Pretty obvious your trolling but I am bored so I will rebut your points...


Bitcoin blocks are on average 10 mins. There is a technical reason for this that I won't get into. If you want faster blocks use Litecoin or some other altcoin. No one is forcing you to use Bitcoin it's opt-in. Bitcoin will get The Lightning Network soon so you can open up payment channels with instant, extremely low fee transactions. Also Schnorr Signatures will be introduced which will optimise Blockchain transactions even further.


In order for you to have scaling problems you need to scale.


This is not about "wanting" to use crypto. This is about needing to use crypto. Some people don't have the luxury of banking or living in the first world where cash is a pretty good medium of exchange. The devs are working day and night to make this scale to those people.


Someone sold you Bitcoin right? That means you can also sell it. Think buddy.


This is not a get rich quick scheme.


Bitcoin is not a final product. It's an evolving technology with the best devs from all over the world working on it.

Does anything have intrinsic value? If no one wanted Gold it's value would fall, if it where intrinsic it wouldn't depend on a humans desire. 
The only thing I can think of with intrinsic value is shelter, even that has problems because it required humans to **need** it which I guess is better than being based on desire.
He often brings up Gold's applications for jewellery but I doubt this is an attribute you want in a currency as it adds value to it that wouldn't otherwise be there. Bitcoin is slightly different since it doesn't have physical applications but it does have utility which is an attribute I would value more over having it useful as jewellery or computers.
If something has practical applications outside it being a medium of exchange surely that makes it a worse type of money.

No. I thought maybe they are vulnerable but if you replace the addresses on the screen the Trezor still shows the address on the device itself so you can verify it's being sent to the right place.

[here]( is the video where he thanks the Bitcoin community for the donations.

@_date: 2018-04-21 11:54:10
If your argument is that its bad because criminals can use it then you should be against the internet, cars, phones, and cash. Monero already has similar features so they will just use that even if we don't innovate, all it does is take the technology away from honest people.
Bitcoin users will benefit from this because people/companies/governments will have less knowledge about how much Bitcoin people own.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:25:49
I agree but with sidechains you wouldn't have the rounding issue.
    Send 1 BTC to sidechain 
    Open channel with 1 sBTC (Sidechain Bitcoin)
    spend 0.00000000001 sBTC on LN.
    Close channel and since the consensus rules of the sidechain allow sub-satoshi amounts nothing is lost.
The only issue you would have is converting it from sBTC to BTC but you wouldn't **need** to convert it and would only cash out when it made sense.
The only purpose of the sidechain would be to allow further decimal points, and not used for scaling.

When you say it "2 kay 15" it is shorter, unless you say the year like "twenty fifteen" which takes the same amount of time to say.
It started in 2010 I think is the earliest I heard it. All over my town there is markings made with pen sharpie's that say "2k10" up to about "2k12" when people stopped saying it.

I don't plan on selling any time soon. The issue for me is my parents, they say I can do what I want with my money but there is a judgement made whenever they know I bought BTC. That's a personal issue that I recon some people here can relate too but maybe not all.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:33:22
If you plan on doing transactions sure (i don't many places that accept alt-coins). The price of bitcoin could be much higher or much lower after August 1st so you have to take that risk yourself.
If you sold out before then at $1800 and had to buy back at $3000 that would be bad...
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:31:00
You should probably just get it all out of there. At the end of the day, you do not control your coins in exchanges.

Also "Law" is the wrong word. It's consensus.
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:55:53
The price of BTC-A and BTC-B will roughly equal the price of BTC now though right? It's not like you all of a sudden will have double the money unless the price goes up independently of this whole situation but given the uncertainty I see the price dropping a lot before any sort of recovery.
Tell me what I got wrong please :)

Why wouldn't they make a discount? If you are accepting currency that is deflationary then it's illogical to demand the same price. Sure there is risk but the first shops to start taking discounts in Bitcoin will see a rise in sales.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:19:38
I see Bitcoin as a currency although I have not bought anything with it yet. I would prefer to spend my fiat money on stuff first.
Most people when they see "Bitcoin accepted" really don't care about the technical details. I can accept dollars on eBay but I live in the UK, what the hell am I going to do with dollars? Me converting it to pounds in no way delegitimises dollars as a currency.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:38:24
The reality is that there will be a un-smooth transition between fiat and cryptocurrencies. When we went from gold to paper I recon a lot of people upon receiving this new paper thing likely traded it into gold at their earliest opportunity.

The price of bitcoin looked exponential up until 3k. I wonder if it will continue that trend after the scaling issue is fixed.
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:36:06
Yeah, I know how it works on a basic level. When you think of 5 million trillion hashes per second, it just blows my mind. That's the reason why getting involved on mining is a pretty bad idea now, me vs the entire hashing power of the network will result in the network winning basically all the time.
The funny thing is this amount of hashing power will be nothing compared to where it will be in even a years time. If someone stumbles across this post in the future they will think 5M TH/s is nothing. We haven't even scratched the surface with user adoption given that the amount of people using bitcoin is only a couple million.

You do not have coins in your wallet. Your wallet contains keys with are assigned with value through the blockchain. Since there will be two blockchains with identical history then the keys associated with BTC will have the same value as BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:13:17
I don't mind that they do not touch the bitcoin. Them accepting bitcoin allows it to become more mainstream. Even if they accept Bitcoin through a Bitpay or some other service I believe it allows them to accept smaller transactions without resorting to cash (I may be wrong).
I don't know what your last statement means.

@_date: 2017-07-28 18:47:07
Everything you said is completely correct.
42M coins on both chains. If you spend BTC you still have BCC. The price of them will likely be different and many people are selling one to buy another potentially doubling their BTC or BCC. 
I am just going to keep both sets of coins. Unless you know what you are doing I suggest you don't spend or buy Bitcoins in the next few days. :D

They need to make a discount for Bitcoin and stop treating it like fiat.
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:32:03
Wow. That's a very good way of thinking about it. Hashing power secures the network. The network is only worth something if it's secure. I wonder if you could estimate the price of bitcoin if a new ASIC machine was created. In other words if you knew what the hashing power would be in a months time how big a role would that play in the price. Sure there are other factors but I wonder how strong the correlation is.
Don't know why I got down voted lol.
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:54:59
I agree being part of a pool is a good idea if your a miner. When they do that calculation do they take into account improvements in ASIC hardware and the future hashing power of the entire network?

Not to mention the fact that you can basically buy it and it doesn't require much maintenance if you set it up properly.
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:50:58
In order to tempt people to spend we actually need businesses to adopt it.
If you are a Bitcoin hodler and you want to buy a coffee you likely will not spend your BTC. What the coffee shop needs to do is put a X% on the coffee such that it's enough for you to take the discount and low enough for them to take that risk. Since fiat decreases in value it causes products to cost more than they are worth. There is a sweet spot for the business and consumer (hodling Bitcoin).
Once Bitcoin purchases are getting discounts in a huge way this will pick up many new users. We of course still need to solve the usability problem but that is being improved everyday.

That's okay. Many people buy BTC in small amount such that they can buy when the price goes way down. I typically buy £15 worth every few days and I was able to buy when the price went down to $1900. I'm planning on getting a part time job and just converting it all into BTC since I am fortunate enough that my parents let me stay here for free. 
Also be careful on August 1st. I am sure you are aware but there could be a fork which could create two versions of bitcoin.

It discards it. Every guess the miner makes increases their chance of guessing right making it useful work not wasted work.

Its funny but its not accurate. 
Miners are not idling, its their main purpose to produce "Sudokus" not their secondary purpose or byproduct.
Edit: loving these downvotes

Bitcoin doesn't waste energy. The energy is being used to secure the network.
The main purpose of a car is to drive, the main purpose of miners it to produce "Sudokus". The post is comparing the byproduct of a car running to the main purpose of a Bitcoin miner which is not an equivalent comparison.

Fair enough. Inflation still negatively impacts savers. Even with interest.
