Wait, I could be *payed* for doing this?
Also: You're conspiracy nuts deluded into buying virtual currency of no real value. Please stop.

It makes me feel like a good investor when I compare myself with those who speculate with a deflationary currency. You cannot split a currency because the value of bitcoins is set. If you increase the number of bitcoin "shares" you half the value of each "share", thus you must give two of these shares to everyone who previously had 1 unless you want to have instant 50% inflation. Because currencies are not like shares and you can buy cents of a bitcoin, splitting the currency makes no sense. Due to the set limit you end inflation but also liquidity because people start to speculate with the currency as it starts to look more like a commodity, reducing it's service value, then consequently the demand, then people sell, price drops, speculators buy more, and start again. The exact same thing happens with gold, but at least they actually have gold. Bitcoin only has ephemeral herd-like speculation to back it up.
In essence, I like bitcoin because it makes me feel better than all those plebs who don't understand the difference between a currency and a commodity. Statistically, most will get rekt. There is always a greater fool.

All currencies rely on trust and your situation is a prime example of why bitcoin cannot function as a currency.

Why am I using Windows 7 instead of a free linux distro? Oh yeah, because stuff works without me having to go into command prompts.
Linux is good on servers and such, but not on my main desktop, thanks.

The biggest strength of Bitcoin is it's ability to attract ever bigger suckers to keep the pyramid scheme going.
You've probably heard it before, but you're a delusional bunch. Put your money in an index fund and understand the power of compound interest. Thank me in 30 years.

Negativity is what deluded people think you're bringing them when you give them a dose of **reality**.

The more the government intervenes, the stronger the sector becomes.
All this will scare competition and the Silk Road has loyal customers because THEY ARE SELLING DRUGS! They are addicted to this "service".

Pyramid scheme is the correct term.

I want Bill Gates to be rich though... thanks to him I can use windows instead of Mac or one of the hundreds of linux distros that still use command prompt for a lot of tasks.
People being able to become rich is a good thing, it's an incentive. Most give it away in the end, either through donations like Warren Buffet or by being fools.
Go back to your commune, you commie.

You don't care that the price is down? It's as if bitcoin has become a part of yourself. Seriously guys, bitcoin is an investment, not a way of life.

The deflationary spiral cometh.

There is always a greater sucker. OP in this case. 
This is such an expensive way to relearn what a pyramid scheme is. It's painful to even watch.

You're not buying shares directly. You might also want to remind them of Madoff.
