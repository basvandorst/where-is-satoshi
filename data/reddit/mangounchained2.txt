In the past year, with all the political drama, it has become very clear that paid shills and bots are very active on the internet. The powers that be are afraid because they are losing control of the narrative. That's why youtube and google and Twitter are coming down on free speech and have been banning and demonetizing alt-right users.
In the conspiracy subreddit I have seen many clear examples of shilling in the past year.

I recently saw a video of an analyst (someone who had a good understanding of Bitcoin) that had found that over 90% of Bitcoin's price can be explained by using a quadratic function. It's the same function you explain the growth of for instance social media networks with.
Edit: found the video:
Apparently it's called "Metcalfe's Law".

Bitcoin as a whole is not a bubble. It's a network that gets its value from the number of users.

The Vatican doesn't worship God anymore. They worship the devil. Just have look at the John Paul VI audience hall which has been built to look like snake on the inside and outside and look at the work of art standing behind the pope:

Last time I checked most people are still rooting for the real Bitcoin.
