Yes 7-11 in Japan is pretty awesome. No bitcoin available yet though.

As evidenced by the word Surprisingly in its title.

PASMO and SUICA cards are very popular as well. You can charge these up with cash at a machine and use to ride the trains, buses, purchase stuff at convenience stores, vending machines, etc. Very useful and transactions are basically instantaneous. Now what if you could charge these with bitcoin. Japan loves payment networks, so I am excited to see where this goes.

Wasn't that just an advertisement for Denarium?

GDAX is the same logon, and of course, same company as Coinbase. You can purchase and transfer bitcoin there for little to no fees. You can move your bitcoin/USD easily between Coinbase and GDAX.

What happens if the wallets held by the ETF get hacked? 
How are those bitcoins any safer than those held on an exchange?
Will the ETF be insured somehow?

just buy some every week or so; trying to time it is usually foolish.

buy half now and send half back later. In the meantime, get verified on GDAX. Then you can make your bitcoin purchase on GDAX when the money arrives in your USD account.

Down to 26th now (for me anyway). Still impressive.

In my experience, money exhanges in Japan offer excellent rates.  Very curious what their btc-to-yen exchange rate is.

I'll keep an eye out. I am in a smaller city near Tokyo, so it may not be available yet.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:21:08
Agreed, will likely see 3000 soon
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:09:37
Thanks, giving it a try.
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:00:38
I don’t think it does yet. But they plan to add support soon I believe.
@_date: 2018-12-26 10:57:42
Thank you and Merry Christmas to you as well.

Try sweeping the private key in to Electrum

I use one of these cards everyday to buy my breakfast at a convenience store. Extremely convenient. I can refill with cash at any train station. There is no identity associated with my card. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:16:38
thanks, I am looking at that. I got lnd up and running, so things are looking good so far.
