Sure, just send me money first so I can be sure this address is legit.

I don't get it.  Are you saying Wall Street died, or Bitcoin?  They are different people in the two pictures, so I can't tell.
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:29:45
Transfers take time.  How long ago did you send it?

Now if only the quality of troll would improve, we'd be all set.

Or what if... and hear me out here... the scam artist... isn't honest.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:31:09
Silly question, but can you confirm you are not the NiceHash hacker? :P
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:59:33
Seems right for a Coinbase app
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:29:05
The US dollar?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:18
They should call it BTCH Coin

Do your mental health a favor, forget about it and check the price once a week.

You just described philosophy's essence.

When it gets to where you think is the lowest it's going to go, buy.

I paid $87,000 in fees, and it took like 3 seconds, I don't know what ya'll are complaining about.

I'm a novice, but from what I've read, the larger node sizes will end up decreasing the amount of people who can manage nodes, increasing centralization around a few, making it easier to control.

"I'm a big 1mg believer for now!"
"Hello, fellow kids."

They stopped getting paid (or got sick of getting paid in BCH coin, now that it's value is down).

BCash isn't Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:54:22
Damn, if I'd just kept my Myspace account, I'd have like 15,000 friends right now((
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:40:04
This is a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:20
Because people don't like con artists, especially when they hurt something you believe in.

This was funny the first time I saw it on the main page of r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:48
It's imaginary Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:18
If Bitcoin cost zero, it'd be really easy to buy all of them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:46:36
Why would you ever pay that much for a transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:22
Remember when people predicted 10k for BCash?  No?  Me neither.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:34:17
Thanks for the clickbait tile and a link to a website with a one sentence "story."

Bitcoin Cash is an attempt by a few people to make themselves rich by creating a fork and pretending their new alt coin is in any way legitimate.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:11:33
Some are blatant scams, others just fail.
Avoid pre-mines unless there's a really good reason and it's a very small amount.
Avoid coins that sell masternodes directly.
Avoid roadmaps that offer nothing other than coin exchange listings and a generic "third party integration."

My wife is from Moscow, she confirms that they do!  But they are triangle shaped and dipped in cranberry sauce.
