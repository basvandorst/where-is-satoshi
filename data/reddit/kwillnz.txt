We need to stay competitive with other coins. 
We do not want to be viewed as an old and slow cryptocurrency. 
We are bleeding our market share. 
We need to get SegWit adopted asap or we will lose.

Let this be a wake-up call for bitcoin supporters. 
We should all feel the gravity of the situation we are in. 
Bitcoin future is not so bright if this high tx fee and long confirmation time continues. 
If we do not adopt SegWit anytime soon, Bitcoin will indeed be an unusable currency.
Please, do push for SegWit adoption for your wallets or exchange places. 
This could really be the start of bitcoin downfall if we aren't careful.

There were people updating this post everyday which had really useful information about SegWit but along the way they have stopped.
I would like to update the post myself everyday but I'm not really computer savvy (i.e. I don't know how to do tables and etc on Reddit)
It would be good if someone could update the guide.

We should bombard them with requests. We don't want another Coinbase right?

Do some research.
The permissionless distributed ledger used in Bitcoin is a chain of communication, which require nodes to validate actions within its protocol. They are essential to the ecosystem just as much as miners who are finding blocks and processing the data.

If we dont run full nodes, miners can basically increase their block reward themselves. We need lots of full nodes to keep miners in check. Read below from bitcoin wiki:
“Lightweight nodes do whatever the majority of mining power says. Therefore, if most of the miners got together to increase their block reward, for example, lightweight nodes would blindly go along with it. This is why it is encouraged that each individual run a full node if possible.”

About your SPV wallet, read below:
According to Vorick, of all the different types of Bitcoin users, full nodes are the only ones that check that the rules are followed. Those who run an SPV node or use some sort of web wallet are putting their trust in others to verify that certain rules are being followed correctly on the most-work chain.
“They’re faster,” Vorick said in terms of SPV nodes. “They download all the headers. They make sure that they are on the chain with the most work, but they don’t actually check that the chain with the most work is legal or is valid.”
Vorick went on to state that SPV nodes are essentially betting that the rest of the network will sufficiently handle the validation process for them.
“SPV nodes just blindly have faith in the broader network to do this process that makes sure that the longest chain is always valid,” Vorick continued. “They don’t actually know. They’re just assuming that the broader network is going to keep them safe.”
Without full nodes, Vorick says, miners are given the ability to do whatever they want. “If people can spend each other’s money [or] if miners can [produce] money out of nowhere, you have a useless system,” he added.

The devs should put this on their top priority. 
Also if you aren't Tech savvy, you could still consider donating  money or setting up a full node. 
We could all play a part in this great experiment. Stopping whining unless you are contributing to the community.
Get on board my friends.

Why you worried about the Sharks? Do you think btc is a scam that will last temporary? Because I don't. Let the whales or Sharks cash out all their btcs. Less manipulation for the network. 
I'm pretty well off so I can invest some money into crypto. I wouldn't be hurt if bitcoin goes to zero tomorrow. Only invest money that you can afford to lose. 
I might not be computer savvy but I did research about btc blockchain technology before I invested. I don't know how great your understanding is of bitcoin technology, but any of  the bitcoin core devs can call your understanding 'sad'.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:26:06
This post is meaningless unless the devs specifically stated a release date. "Sooner" could be 18 months

You need to go and educate yourself. 
Just go and google yourself why you should run a full node. I’m not talking about validating transactions. It’s about keeping the overall consensus protocol safe and sound.
If only miners run full nodes, they can bend the rules easily and the rest of blocks will just blindly follow that. Read below:
1) HELPS THE NETWORK
Running your own full node is the only way to have full control and to ensure that all the rules of Bitcoin are being followed. Nodes do this by rejecting blocks and transactions that don’t follow the consensus rules and by rejecting connections from peers that send them (or too many of them).
In this sense, nodes are more important than hash power (miners) as they are the ones that verify that the blockchain is following the rules. Even with the longest Proof-of-Work chain, nodes will still determine if said chain follows the rules and whether or not it is accepted or ignored. This is why you should run a full node even if you are not a miner.
According to Bitcoin Wiki:
[…] full nodes enforce the consensus rules no matter what. However, lightweight nodes do not do this. Lightweight nodes do whatever the majority of mining power says. Therefore, if most of the miners got together to increase their block reward, for example, lightweight nodes would blindly go along with it.

Good stuff and info mate.
Keep up the good work.
I've been inspired to promote SegWit myself.
Don't forget you can all contribute to this. Promote, Promote, and Promote.
Put pressure on exchange places to adopt SegWit otherwise ditch them.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:49:17
Please ditch your wallet if it doesn't support SegWit!
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:21:56
Lightening network is too far away. We need to enforce segwit somehow to everyone. 
We shouldn't give an option of adopting or not.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:49:04
good work mate. This is what we need. 
Let's spread the word. We need people to implement SegWit right now!

Hey just wondering, have you tired running a LN node as well with GUI, on top of bitcoin qt?

Do your research. South Korean markets used to have a very high premium but not anymore. For the past few months, the premium has been only like 3 percent. Sometimes, the btc price was even lower than global markets.
FUD started in South Korea due to an unexpected police raid undertaken at one of their top 3 exchanges, Upbit. I think it triggered the down trend.

Non mining / non transacting nodes still reject the blocks that do not follow the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:17:06
When you run a full node in listening mode you become a peer on the peer to peer network. You share block data with other peers, and validate anything you receive.
If your node rejects a block it received, then it doesn't share that rejected block with other nodes, and you (temporarily initially) block the node that sent it to you. When a majority of nodes agree on the validation rules, then any block built to different rules will not propagate, and the node that sent it, will have trouble broadcasting any more blocks to the network.
In this way, your node serves two purposes. You are part of the communication network, and you get to participate in the decision around which blocks are valid on the chain. If you are an outlier, running different validation rules to everyone else, then you will be excluded from the chain. On the other hand, if you run the consensus validation rules that have majority representation on the network, then you help defend the network from blocks that don't meet those consensus rules.

Can you post a step by step guide as to how you installed LN? I've got a RP3 and keen to do the same
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:09:18
Exactly. 
Miners decide which chain to mine. Actually, they have freedom to mine whatever they want. They can change bitcoin protocol and start mining 1gb block size tomorrow if they wanted. 
But they dont. Why? 
Because as you said the users decide which chain has a value. The users decide what is a real 'bitcoin'.
The users do this by rejecting and validating the mined blocks. By running a full node (whether it is a mining node or non-mining node), we keep the consensus in check.
This is why non mining / non transacting nodes still help the network.  
Non mining / non transacting nodes are in listening mode. They are still a peer on the peer to peer network. You share block data with other peers, and validate anything you receive. If your node rejects a block it received, then it doesn't share that rejected block with other nodes, and you (temporarily initially) block the node that sent it to you. When a majority of nodes agree on the validation rules, then any block built to different rules will not propagate, and the node that sent it, will have trouble broadcasting any more blocks to the network.
Hopefully now you understand why non mining / non transacting nodes are still beneficial to the network. 
For example, I run a node that is non mining and non transacting. I have more than 16 connections on my node. Of course, I am following Bitcoin Core protocol. So my node will reject any mined blocks that do not follow this protocol. Therefore it strengthens the network.

Running a non mining node does help keeping the consensus in check.

Miners are the customers of the users, and their only duty is to secure the network. Miners don't have the power to decide the protocol, otherwise we wouldn't have Segwit and we would have big blocks.

I never said our 'good nodes' can stop another 'bad' network nodes. Bitcoin is an open source code. They can split and do whatever they want. We already have bitcoin gold, bcash, bitcoin diamond and who know how many others there will be. The purpose of full nodes is not to stop 'bad' blocks propagating on their own chain. They can do whatever they want on their own chain, but we want our chain to be separate and not influenced by their chain.   
The 'bitcoin core' nodes have no power to stop those split chains. 
The 'core' nodes simply reject blocks that are not following 'core' protocol, hence keeping the original bitcoin separate from those other chains. That is all they do - Reject blocks that aren't following the core protocol. As long as non-mining / non-transacting bitcoin core nodes reject blocks that are not following bitcoin core protocol, it becomes harder for 'bad' people to mess up with bitcoin network.  For example, if someone tries to broadcast 8MB size blocks within 'bitcoin core' network, many 'core' nodes (non mining / non transacting) will deny it. That is these nodes are still helping the network. Again, miners can choose whatever the chain they wish to mine but they will have to follow the 'core' protocol if they want to successfully mine 'core' blocks within bitcoin 'core' network.      
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:52:43


Yea, you are right. But I don't trust those Chinese miners too much. Hence I want other non-mining/transacting nodes to be present. They strengthen the network by being a peer on the network. Basically keeping an eye on the miners.
