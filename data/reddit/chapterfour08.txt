@_date: 2018-07-02 16:21:24
What kind of anesthetic?

Awd and fwd is way better in the snow but rwd is more fun to drive. You can kick the rear end out, do burnouts, and rear wheel drive cars handle better because there is less understeer.

This was so upsetting when I learned this about the skills in Runescape lol
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:48:57
I'd take it. Even if it is just a 3 series with an m sport package. As long as its 6 speed rear wheel drive which I doubt it lol

I went to send my buddy 250$ and they charged me an 8$ fee. Gives me more hope for crypto to be honest.
