Is that P2Pool as in, p2pool.org, or the actual p2pool protocol?
@_date: 2014-06-15 23:00:12
I dunno if I'd say I'm a furry, I just like the art. RP/fursuits/that nonsense is too hardcore for me.
But yeah, I *did* warn everyone.
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:19:06
And yeah, not for everyone. But figured hey, might as well try!
@_date: 2014-08-09 06:32:05
Were the people having trouble with the 20 dollar minimum charging less than that per commission or something? That doesn't make much sense since that's sort of the lowest price I've ever seen for a commission.
I've commissioned a lot of stuff via bitcoin, no problems so far, other than initially convincing people to take them.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:39:48
I'm a big fan of bitcoin for adult stuff- in a very similar vein, I've been trying to convince adult artists on hentaifoundry/tumblr/furaffinity/etc to take bitcoin, seems like a win-win but people are incredibly cautious about it (which is perfectly reasonable, tbh).
Do you have any tips for getting people to try out bitcoin? So far I've been paying extra and walking them through setting up a coinbase or bitpay account and that seems to work fairly well (maybe 65% of all the people I ask try it out, at least!)
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:51:38
I'd love to xpost, but I just made this throwaway. Any chance you'd be willing to toss it up for me?
Either way, thanks for at least reading my long rant!
@_date: 2014-06-16 15:38:49
Yeah I know artists that would like to use a service like this, but obviously it's porn. No dice I guess
@_date: 2014-08-08 20:06:49
I hope you at least understand that "bitcoin goes up over long term" isn't a good argument, and just sounds like ponzi scheme hype. Not a good way to convince anyone of anything.
Probably 15 or so artists? That's just a ballpark though. 
I don't think I, nor any of the artists who take bitcoin, would be interested in a story on your site. I'll ask though.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:49:29
Spam harder, jesus
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:11:23
Reluctant? Something I did wrong? All ears for improvements, tried to mark this as NSFW as I possibly could, and if there is somewhere else I can post this I'd love to hear it
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:41:30
I've gotten at least 20 separate artists set up to receive bitcoin in the NSFW art community (think Hentaifoundry, Furaffinity, tumblr)
Good way to pay, since paypal doesn't like adult stuff, and people like to be anonymous with their porn purchasing.
I made a post [here]( a while ago, if this is your jam, please go check out some of these artists and/or ask around, that list is a lot longer than last time I wrote it up.
@_date: 2014-06-15 18:14:46
Yeah, feel free to follow if you'd like. Crazy shit though, fair warning.
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:26:33
Even if that is the logic you follow, you can't see how that type of talk is going to make most people uneasy?
@_date: 2014-06-15 22:59:16
I didn't, but even if I did
"Oh no, my throwaway account, whatever will I doooooooo"
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:57:32
Hey, a chance to bust out my throwaway again!
I commission a lot of porn artists to draw weird shit (I made a post about it [here]( a while ago, and I've gotten a lot more artists since then which is always nice), and I'd prefer not to give every one of them my name/address/etc when paying via say, paypal or credit card.
Bitcoin also is nice for the artists, since paypal doesn't approve of what they sell (or any adult content, for that matter). If paypal finds out that they are selling porn for ppusd, they shut down their account, and steal all their money.
And since lots of these artists are in other countries, they save ~5% in paypal fees, since I point most of them to bitpay. 
Pretty good deal all around!
@_date: 2014-08-09 07:02:37
Yeah I never cut it nearly that close.
@_date: 2014-06-15 22:48:13
Uh, what?
@_date: 2014-06-15 22:15:31
Yeah, definitely. It's a big concern in the nsfw art community, cause paypal hates them so much.
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:15:16
Maybe, but those fees are really high! 30%? You're hard up enough as it is to get them to use bitcoin, let alone pay that much in fees. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:18:23
I suppose I don't have any counterargument for that. Still fairly expensive.
Maybe offer a flat rate plan?
@_date: 2015-05-11 13:58:55
Paying artists to draw ridiculous furry porn without having to give up my name, address, etc. Very handy, and it works very well for people that will take it (I've gotten probably 40+ artists to use bitcoin at least once, for me).
Problem is, other commissioners don't use bitcoin and so artists are still getting fucked HARD by paypal, not only over fees but by chargebacks, and now paypal just added a $2500 fee if you violate their AUP, which includes selling anything nsfw.
@_date: 2014-06-16 03:24:52
Can I ask who you support?
@_date: 2014-06-15 18:57:39
I'm bi, dicks just look good IMO. 
It's a fetish, not sure what you want me to tell you.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:03:18
Eh, I wouldn't bother harassing them about a tiny subreddit very few people use. What is the expected content here anyway?
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:57:24
I thought about it more, and as long as there's no charge to keep it hosted, then 25-30% is feasible I think.
Ideally this could be a service that offers cc payment too, but that's obviously going to be more expensive.
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:35:05
I commission a lot of artists for drawn adult fetish art. Currently the standard is for everyone to use paypal, which sucks because paypal will ban your account if they find out you're selling adult/furry art.
I looked at the AUP for Payza and it seems promising, but what sort of regulations/taxes/etc are involved for an independent artist  taking commissions for adult art?
Other than that, all I can say is that your fees seem very high compared to most other payment processors, especially in the bitcoin space- do you plan on lowering them at any point (particularly for bitcoin)?
Thanks for taking the questions in this thread :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:11:28
[Here's the post I made about a few artists accepting bitcoin!](
@_date: 2015-05-26 14:40:14
I've gotten a lot of artists to take bitcoin, primarily for furry/fetishy art, but I tend to be the only one commissioning for bitcoin. If you want to commission some custom drawn porn, it's relatively cheap (15-75 typically) depending on the detail you want.
Artists need to see more demand than just one person, so please consider commissioning some art!
A few artists I'd recommend off the top of my head-
(all very nsfw/porn)
Feel free to ask me any questions.
