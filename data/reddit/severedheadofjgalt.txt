This is how we get adoption and end the bear market. Good work, sir!

No don't buy until it goes lower. Not financial advice.

No one is claiming they knew about it. No one is claiming they didnt have the money to back it.

So you're saying Bitfinex or Tether were the ones manipulating the market? Any proof?
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:19:24
Ok ill rebuy at 5k then.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:15:50
Makes no sense. Someone had to buy the tether. That's not artificial.

Well I hope I see you begging for change under a highway overpass

Except you should never lose 100% of a position unless you invested in a total scam, in which case you deserve to lose it all. If people just actually do research into coins with good Tech and actual use cases instead of buying whatever coin happens to be less than a dollar on binance, they can sleep soundly at night knowing that long-term they should be fine.

I think it'll cut out some of their business, force them to adapt in other ways, and in some ways compete with them so they actually have to get better.

Kill yourself with me! I mean HODL and smoke weed.

Lol no they are traceable, immutable, and public. I personally wouldn't use crypto to buy weed. But if you're going to use it for black market activity at least use XMR or PART (once it has Ring CT).

You could sell now at some profit and try to buy lower, but at this point it is risky imo. I call 5.9k bottom. I'm buying more when we hit there or when I see a 1k red (or green) hourly candle. Not financial advice.

How does this make sense? Didn't they have to buy the tether first? What was artificial? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:13:04
I would hold for 2-5 or 10 years, or sell at top of next bubble and buy the crash and repeat. Keep it safe.
