Bitcoin is already a worldwide payment network.  It's just one that currently runs better when people aren't hammering it on purpose.  Which in itself shows that there is a need that needs to be filled.  The problem is that various groups disagree on the way to fill the need.  Some even wonder if it should be filled or if growth in that particular area should be throttled by the code.  I personally think that just creates a war where the code has to be changed anyway and who suffers during war?  The little people, that's who.
  
This community is too quick to call troll and to accuse.  Ask yourself why you do it.  Are you still a moderator here?  If so, why are you exasperating a us vs them agenda within the community?  You cite nothing too...

Bitcoin is a low cost payment network...  is this some sort of test?

btc-e haven't identified themselves and they are one of the oldest exchanges.

It's called a pump and dump.  Look at the network distribution of litecoin, it is miniscule compared to bitcoin.  I wouldn't put my money there with any type of long term thinking.

Why didn't the feds also erase the evidence that helped indict two federal agents on corruption charges?

It was in his journal and presented at his trial.

Amir Taaki lies and is really good at it.

It would have if it could be proved they knew it was happening.  Especially if they had evidence of them putting out hits on people.
  
Craigslist has a mechanism for reporting and dealing with those types of submissions and they act on them.

I hope 21 inc gets more power, I like their blocks.

Not really, they do this for lots of events, not just bitcoin and they have done this for bitcoin events in the past so nothing new.

Oh look, a litecoin investor in its natural habitat!

Can you show examples?

I don't agree with your assessment.  I don't believe this is a coordinated attempt by "trolls" to push a new narrative.  When looking at the context of those quotes, it is not clear.

So Force planted evidence that incriminated himself? 
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:35:34
He wrote about that.  He said that some day they may make a movie about him so he should document it.  I'm not making that up!
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:35:50
You are incorrect.  Bitcoin is perfect, it us humans that are fallible.  A system that caters to human fallibility is fallible proportional to the catering.

The 6th is left out of the trial because it is Ulbricht and Nob(Agent Force).  The prosecution in Ulbricht's trial was careful not to introduce any evidence that involved Force and Bridges so they omitted it but the defense knew.  That's why it looks disingenuous when the ulbricht team claim evidence was withheld and they didn't get a fair trial.  They knew about what was left out from the start but they didn't see the indictment until later.

No, I disagree that all of those comments are pushing that agenda.
