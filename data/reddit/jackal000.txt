You will never get anywhere without taking risks. All of Wallstreet is gambling to according to your logic. Who knows whenever the housing market will collapse again and take the dollar with it. Did you take a look at Venezuela or even turkey? Fiat is a yesterdays currency. Crypto is the future. I don't gamble on that. I know for a fact that it is. Gambling is uneducated tossing money at something hoping it will give you something in return. Investing is educated tossing money at something you know that will give you a return. Yes it is a fine line but a line none the less.

That is correct. That's why I wanted btc to rise in volume and dominance. The global market isn't ready yet for 1700 new projects. Btc is just the most dominant one and thus most known one. We are still very early. You probably know about the web bubble back in 2000. A lot of projects died back than. But crypto projects are different. As long as there is a use case they will be supported. The fact that even the sec still hasn't made up their mind about crypto is enough evidence to proof that crypto just left the starting line. Look at the bigger picture. Alts do follow btc because most alts are derived from btcs code. Btc is the trunk and most alts are just branches. Logical that alts do what they do at this time. As soon as btc does get mass adopted alts will get independent valuations.

History doesn't repeat but often rhymes. And if you are not seeing the potential I cryptocurrency then you are the one who's silly. Also bubbles don't exist. Waves do. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:25:31
That's why you need to do research to pick the best ones. Some will x100 Imho.

I call bullshit. Yes, bitcoin will be one of the biggest cryptocurrencies. But not the only one. Cryptocurrencies are culturally distributed and opt in used. Therefore there cant be just 1  currency. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:13:57
Most of those gullible fools we already lost in the big dip and we are shedding the last ones at the moment I believe. That's the reason indd for btc to rise. However. Thumb rule nr 1 still stands. Short term volatility doesn't affect the technology.

Goldman, cboe, jp Morgan, Microsoft and the like.

Let btc rise and stabilize. When the bulls return Altcoin holders will profit the most. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:09:14
If that's your opinion you are not seeing the bigger picture. 1 share will. Cost 200k usd, enabling safely the entree of big companies into the cryptoscene. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:30:09
U don't get it. Yes the best ones grow slow. But will 100x nonetheless.

We all(read: newcomers)  lost 90% bro. The peak had volume.

But dad?! 90% of the alts correlating to bitcoin and  higher multipliers are cheaper achieved.

I meant the cryptospace.   Implying that if you aren't patient you haven't been in the cryptospace long enough.  Was a mere coincidence that you actually joined reddit in march

Nice hodl bro. I bought also in November.. But I realize that we are still very young in this market. Think long run. Like you are doing. You don't lose want you don't sell. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 19:43:08
When the news channels catches on the real hype begun. That's when it soared in Dec 17. I got in late November and 85% loss atm. I don't mind that. I am a believer. I've read several books and learned some strategies. Still hodling for now.

It was just a test run mate. And we are still 3k up from last week. If you can't handle the stress crypto is not for you.

No ill punch you right back. My point is, bitcoin has never ever shown bearish curve in the long run. Bubbles yes. But long term bearish no.

By rising from 1k in January 2017 to nearly 4 this year. Stop being negative and buy the dip wich isnt actually a dip. And get rich. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:49:01
But you can buy way more and easier than with cash.

That's a casasius coin.  No longer in use. And it kinda beats the purpose of bitcoin. As it's off the counter.

ELI5 about what negative yield debt is pls? Am foreign, noob and curious.
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:21:38
Well. He is not entirely wrong. Back in the day these iconic irl bitcoins actually existed. The casasius coin it was called. They had the adress beneath an hologram seal wich you could peel off and use it to spend on things.
