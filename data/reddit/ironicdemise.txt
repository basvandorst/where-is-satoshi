This is custom, I write everything myself and host from home.
It's not fast enough but until I get a bigger internet connection it'll have to do.
Testing externally has worked with previous websites I've scratched up as tests.

I'd be fine with Kraken I guess.
I've noticed that at bitcoinstore a lot of the products are slightly less than retail, is this common for bitcoin?
Looking at the ASUS Sabertooth 990FX.
.3061btc/306100 bits?/$178.79/£106
It averages around £130/$218 online at normal stores.
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:13:08
Well, I looked into it a little and was told the usual, it's not an investment or a way to make a quick buck but it's easier to use than normal currency... once you know what you're doing.
I set up a few wallets but at the moment I don't know if buying btc would benefit me because I have nowhere to spend it that I wouldn't just use card.
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:47:49
Guess it's a good thing in theory?
The reasonably high learning curve acts like a kind of filter of people until you, or it, is ready.
Between bitcoin slowly becoming a more viable currency for everybody and while everybody learns how to use a new currency.
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:43:58
Hmm, Seems like once again it's going to be pretty tough to get people to part with their money when it's a large investment.
I'll give it a crack though, what's the worst that can happen.
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:05:37
Fantastic, I didn't even think about using a seed.
I'll grab electrum and try it out.
I'm not too worried about keeping the information off of my computer for security, I just don't trust hard drives... or my computer.
Hm, do electrum get my keys, looks like they could bolt with all the btc in the keys they generate one day, seeing how I have to connect to their server?
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:01:43
How much is 400 bits?
This isn't doge, this has got to be a reasonable amount to send... why?
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:45:02
Perhaps, but none of the children I see are very "techie" in that curious sense as much as they can reel off stats about the iphone without knowing what those stats mean.
I'm hoping I can keep my own children curious enough to be interested in this kind of thing when they are older.
I just honestly cannot imagine my younger siblings or nieces/nephews having the intelligence to realize bitcoin is a "thing" and not just computer rubbish.
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:25:06
I'll have a look at these, if they're that easy then I'll use them and just move my btc into one place every once in a while.
 I imagine their security to be better than mine at the moment anyways.
@_date: 2014-05-13 21:57:54
Well, that's not the way to go about promoting an open and honest currency.
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:30:31
Bitcoins page states "keeping your savings with Bitcoin is not recommended at this point." so... yeah.
Also all the talk about "hackers" seems a bit uneducated.
The whole thing seems like a good idea, adevertised by somebody who doesn't understand.

I'm pretty sure that we were all ignorant at some point, I know that when I lived with my parents I never had to deal with money and therefore never cared about how it works... it goes for everything though, people need to make an effort to expose themselves to new ideas and have the humility to understand when they don't know something instead of assuming that being an adult, your "life experience" is a good starting point for anything.
Most of us don't know a hell of a lot and should try to keep learning even after education and after people "expect" us to learn.
@_date: 2014-05-14 09:43:58
I just feel like these things need to be explained, even idiots should understand how bitcoin works.

I think he's safe too, but I say he should go to the police anyway.
First of all, this should be seen to even if it's a stupid scam, secondly on the very very minor chance he's being emailed by an incompetent but dangerous person then the police should have had some contact.
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:02:20
Alright, so, not a nest egg.
Savings nonetheless, Apologies.
I don't feel comfortable with online services, I'd rather be in control and this is as much for learning as it is using.
I'm planning to use multibit, core eats up my computer and I'm not running a full node on this machine any time soon.
@_date: 2014-05-26 13:28:29
How expensive is it going to be to buy bitcoin, if I buy £5 of bitcoin, can I actually spend £5 *worth* of bitcoin at say, humblebundle?
Or will I lose a significant amount from transaction fees or cuts from middlemen?
@_date: 2014-05-14 11:17:44
That's good to hear, I hope that some people pay attention and confront their misinformation. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:26:44
The more companies support it the more convenient it will be, at the moment I just don't see the point in spending money on btc just to use it straight away on purchases.
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:39:41
Burn out a motor, sure.
He asked if the batteries would explode, these where decent batteries designed to last a long time and had venting protection to prevent expansion and explosion.
I don't recommend putting the wrong batteries into the wrong equipment but these particular batteries had very little chance of exploding like a firework, all things I would have explained if he listened... but at least he listens better than you read I guess.
It might explode, but the chances are very very slim, it would more likely break in a way that's far less interesting to a 13 year old.

If it's javascript, it's just like downloading a program.
You could download the .html file and diconnect from the internet and STILL generate your key.
You can run web-pages offline if you save them, unless the server needs interaction.
So... you could also download the javascript file and run that.
It's like a youtube video, they send you the file, and you run it... which is why you need flash.

I'm kind of torn on the topic because if you found out that Google was reading your email ^(cough ^cough ^asiftheyaren't) people would be enraged!
I feel as though these messages aren't personal though, but more like transaction notes for anybody in the transaction? Like a not to a postman telling him to hide your fragile china in the back garden because you are out?
Regardless of whether it's alright for them to look at messages, and they should perhaps make it clearer for people so they don't act like OP, I think that they did the right thing with the message.
@_date: 2014-05-26 20:09:27
Wow, £40 to transfer £5... a bit ridiculous.
How should one be able to get into bitcoin when it costs so much to buy obtain bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:37:39
Your mistake is that children don't look anything up anymore.
So many youngsters I know have been buying laptops, tablets, phones and even xbox games because it's a newer model than the last and when I try and explain things they just glaze over.
My brother in-law is 13 and asked if he put a 12v battery from one of his rc cars into his 5v rc car, would it "blow up" and I said "no (Cue glaze)" and tried to explain how batteries worked but he was then off to see if the android tablet a model above his was available yet.
I honestly don't think they're going to care about bitcoin unless it's easier or cheaper than what they're already doing.
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:53:04
It isn't a huge margin but if there's a 2% fee on Kraken but you skip the 3% fee from paypal, 1% cheaper if the store passes on the savings.
I think I'll just grab £10/£20 worth of bitcoin and see if I can understand the value of what I'm purchasing with it.
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:25:43
I have neither the time nor the money to invest significantly.
@_date: 2014-08-24 16:45:40
just leave and find a bitcoin community elsewhere that's more concerned with y'know... bitcoin and not so much the politics and tin-foil hats.
@_date: 2014-07-25 00:36:50
+1 for the professionalism of coinbase.
Regardless of whether they thinks it's a joke or not it's their responsibility to remain strictly professional and I'd rather do business with people who clamp down on "jokes" like this, which by the way are not very funny or clever.
You want to use Coinbase, or Paypal? You need to act a bit more mature and professional.
Consider perhaps you weren't joking and are in fact just an arrogant terrorist?
Honestly... as a business I think this was a great call, especially with the stigma some believe about bitcoin being for illegal uses.
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:45:48
Yeah... I wouldn't know how to buy some to try it out... Everywhere has a minimum order that's above what I'd buy just to "experiment"
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:14:09
I don't know if I'd trust locals... I don't know though.
I think I'm an idiot though, I don't know anything.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:51:39
hm, yeah that makes sense.
I think I'm still getting used to the way btc has been flipped.
Bits aren't worth much, while btc was worth a lot -_-
I should start using bitcoin, but I wouldn't know what wallets I prefer.
Like choosing a username -_-
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:01:48
Isn't this game heavily inspired by EvE?
I imagine real currencies is a big difference, as well as with their being a greater variety in items, there will be less obviously strict builds.
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:35:32
Wait, they don't charge to convert money to bitcoin?
I'm from the UK could this be an easy safe way to start using bitcoin?
how do they make money?
Can I use a debit card instead of credit?
@_date: 2014-05-03 14:20:14
On the music, I have no idea other than maybe looking for some open-source music?
I would be more interested once it's got it's features down and shows what it's meant to do, but at the moment I don't actually understand **why** I would want to use this over other wallets.
As an idea, it's quite good. It looks nice, it seems to work well.
It might be good just as a small wallet that's easy to use (Obviously I wouldn't trust a main wallet to a chrome app, but it could be easy to drop a couple bits in their for a transaction).
I just think it needs work presenting itself.
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:04:51
I can't imagine people wanting to use it until it has a clear direction...
As somebody who is interested but doesn't know anything I can tell you from a nobody's point of view that it doesn't seem worth it until it's sorted itself out.
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:23:02
A video like that is unnecessary, It's a slideshow of screenshots with cheesy music.
Sorry man, not a fan of videos that are just turned into videos to be on youtube.
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:07:53
Shame... there's the makings of something worthwhile in bitcoin if people would stop trying to fight other currencies and just get on with using it.
It's stupid to say, but there's too much politics for most people.
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:15:25
To be honest, I didn't know how my currency really worked until I looked up Bitcoin.
You grow up with it and don't really question it, but I found some very good resources on fiat that didn't relate to bitcoin and showed how broken it truly is and how people didn't like it even before bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:17:57
Alright, quite pleased with all this.

Don't know what your issue is here.
The reason I said usually, doubt etc. is because some people prefer Windows or Mac, and that's their opinion, just like Open Source being good is my opinion.
I think bitcoin is great, it think it's very secure and I think it certainly beats government controlled currency in many ways so I don't know why you've gotten so defensive.
As I'm sure many know about one or two crowd-sourced projects having trouble with fraudulent charge-backs and I'm sure people would feel more secure 
knowing that their money can't be touched even if somebody "hacks" a bank or steals your details from PSN.
Seriously... why call me out for "spouting bs hyperbole" when I KNOW I'm not an expert on Bitcoin or Open Source technology, for me it's just a hobby and something I use instead of Windows/Mac... Maybe I'm just that "hipster" who uses these things without properly understanding the ins and outs, but believe it or not, a lot of people can use bitcoin without understanding it 100%.
Do I know the way blocks are hashed and why? No, only vaguely grasp that.
Do I know that it's got several benefits over more commonly used currency? Yes, I have researched it enough because I think bitcoin is interesting.
I hope that most of the community doesn't seem as elitist as yourself, because I find you quite alienating.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:53:54
That's a shame, I wouldn't mind if I broke even, but I don't really want to get into it if it's a net loss.
I would enjoy learning about it, but I'd probably get some entertainment out of several other hobbies without knowing that, essentially, the whole thing is a failure to its purpose.
If I mine bitcoin and don't make a penny, isn't that doing it wrong?
All I'll have learned is how btc is actually generated by people who can afford to, and eventually all our currency will be coming, essentially, from banks?
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:19:33
Who knows?
Bitcoin is OpenSource and it's done phenomenal and it's only competition is it's open source alternatives.
Linux servers are usually considered to be the best in some scenarios (I doubt it'll beat Windows or Mac 100% of the time, but I'm positive it is the best for most situations, without a doubt, that is almost fact)
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:07:09
I guess so, I think I'll do some reading, watch it more closely and grab a miner when I can... after christmas.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:17:36
It's "virtual"... if the money in the bank is "virtual" (That is to say, the money before you withdraw it, your "credit")
It's digital like... like a Game or Music is digital, it "exists" and is agreed upon by people involved that it's owned and has similar "properties" to real objects.
You can sell an MP3 or you can buy Minecraft... those things then belong to you (Or at least a licence to use them in most cases)
But if you WROTE a game or MP3, that would be yours, and you could sue somebody for taking it?
I might be wrong, but I get the gist of where you are coming from... I think it's all semantic though...
Virtual = theoretical / unable to exist outside of "data"
Digital = stored as data
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:58:15
Well, that's what I was thinking.
It looks as though if I grab a cheap ASIC like an "asicminer, blockeruptor" off Amazon for ~£40 it will be ok.
I'm thinking to consider the initial investment just for the hobby, as if I were buying a video game or book, and then the electricity costs aren't an issue, I could get a steady trickle of btc and learn more about the community, and support btc as a currency... with christmas coming up it's one of the few things I actually think about when people ask what I want.
Just a geek hobby... but I didn't see the point if a USB ASIC in a pi didn't even cover the cost of running.
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:33:25
Yeah, send them info that is basically a nonsense account...
Just like when people ask for your login details and you give them jargon names and passwords.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:46:19
I'm just hoping I can get into it and cover electricity costs mainly, I'm not expecting to even get £10 out of it
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:00:41
I'll look at those links, I only know as much as the average person who's looked into Bitcoin.
I hope more people realize how viable bitcoin is, but at the moment I think it's just not as easily available for people who basically don't want to understand what they're using.
