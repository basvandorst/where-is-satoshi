Can someone ask the NYSE's chairman to tell millennials to, you know, actually put some of their money into bitcoin if this is truly the case? In the United States alone, according to a study shared by Forbes a couple of years back, millennials have a combined wealth of around $600 billion. Why isn't that wealth being poured into bitcoin? What about the other hundreds of billions being held in fiat the globe over?

LOL! You clearly have just shown to me and anyone who is bound to read this how much you don't know of what you are talking about. Chinese businesses almost exclusively do their foreign business in U.S. dollars. It's kind of the reason why the Central Bank of China's foreign currency reserves are almost entirely denominated in U.S. dollars. 
And even on the FOREX markets, the Yuan accounts for 1% of daily trades. The U.S. dollar's share of that is 43.5% and it has done nothing but grow since QE measures were implemented across the EU.

Did you even read the article? It doesn't make a single mention of the U.S. Government deliberately funding terrorist acts through the Taliban. It talks about how the U.S. Government gave funds to the Taliban when they decided to outlaw the cultivation of opium. This was in May 2001, long before 9/11.


Again, did you even read the damn article? This makes no mention of the U.S. Government deliberately funding Al-Qaeda, let alone terrorist attacks. None of these two articles support your damn point.


Wow! Salon.com... What a reputable source you have there! /s 
The article, rather conveniently, provides us with no sources for their more extreme claims and instead takes the flamboyantly stupid route in its writing. I would point them out to you, but Salon doesn't allow me to copy and paste. Shitty article written by someone who should have spent more time looking for source on his rather open claims. I could have written a better article as a high school senior.
To summarize, the two even remotely reputable organizations you linked to(CATO and NY Times) did not support your claim, Salon apparently doesn't like to provide sources on anything besides the claims it can easily verify, and even then, provides us with some wacky links such as [this]( and the other is some random tech blog(?) no one on Earth has heard about.

This is so false that it is actually incredible to me that it even received a couple of upvotes. The money owed to American government authorities will never and can't ever be erased because they are owed to authorities other than the U.S. Federal Government itself. Most of the cash owed to federal government authorities (nearly all of it) is owed to Social Security, Federal Retirement and Disability, military retirement, and other employee/people oriented assistance agencies. Not only would that be depressingly devastating to the U.S. public and economy, it would cause an international bond/stock market panic levels of magnitude worse that the most recent global recession. So, whether or not those debts could be wipe out with an executive order is irrelevant because it will never happen.

From the article:


What kind of silly methodology is that? The paper they cite includes chargebacks into their definition of "fraud". I think it is common knowledge that *no*, chargebacks in general are not committed for fraudulent purposes. If a customer made a chargeback, it is probably for a good purpose. Bank/credit card fraud where funds are used for illegal purposes or stolen successfully is only a $14 billion annual "industry". Relative to the amount of financial assets that exist and the amount of money that is transacted, this is nothing. Especially now that credit card companies are offering a plethora of anti-fraud features.

Growing transaction rates tells us nothing about bitcoin's growth as a currency. If we looked at transaction rates for large, established currencies such as the U.S. Dollar, the Euro, or the Chinese Yuan, the figures would be extremely large beyond comprehension. I mean, just look at FOREX markets as an example. FOREX markets do nearly $2 quadrillion worth of transactions annually while only ~$20 trillion is actually being traded.
A useful measure would be to show how much bitcoin is being used to purchase things. Last year, Bitpay, which controls half of bitcoins customer to merchant sales transfers, only recorded around $400 million in sales. In other words, the bitcoin economy is only ~$1 billion large. According to Bitpay, something like 70% of their sales were mining related, which tells us that the *true bitcoin economy* is ~$300 million. "True bitcoin economy" being defined as non-mining related purchases.

Steady growth? What in heavens name are you talking about? Bitcoin is a speculative asset taken seriously by no one, hence why in its 7 years of existence, no considerable measure of financial assets has been traded for it. 


Miniscule? Have you been living under a rock? Apple and Google Pay are miniscule when compared to VISA, American Express, and other credit card companies, but they are levels of magnitude larger and more economically significant than bitcoin (not to mention the fact that the two have much more potential as well). 


I'm not trying to "pigeon hole" anything. I'm telling you that bitcoin's insignificance is shown by the fact that it is virtually non existent relative to the amount of financial assets that exist. If bitcoin was in any way significant in the financial world, much more than $3 billion would be put in it. Millennial, baby boomers... no one is bothering to put their money into bitcoin and virtually no one is using it to pay for anything. All bitcoin has that is worthy of anything seems to be the blockchain, which banks are trying to create their own version of. 
I was sympathetic to the hype when it began, but now the whole operation is dead. It has turned into a bit for Chinese money launderers and dark net markets.


Google and Apple aren't getting into the banking industry. They are technology companies looking to get into all sorts of technological endeavours. They don't want to risk their margins to get into something as hyper complicated as finance. As a result, other companies in other industries are at risk, but not the finance world.
In other words, the only shake up banks are getting are being done by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, and other commissions around the globe.
