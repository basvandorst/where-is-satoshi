I would do the same. They just protecting their assets. It's their money not yours. And they are well aware when this ponzi pop they won't ever see their money again. Would you borrow your money to your friends or family knowing they are going to blow it on bitcoin. Hell no!!!

Yes he wants to read only news that are positive and good for his investment. Anything bad needs to be swiftly deleted and banned.

At the moment anybody can laundering money through it. Apparently few of the biggest wallets are own by by drug cartels who legally laundering money through it so I can see some laws coming out soon to prevent this.

It's dropping because everyone is dumping. Sell it while you can and buy again at first major support around 8000, 8500 ish.

You can easily get anywhere between 30$ and 40$ a day on that setup

Pretty sad that he even left exposed his real address on the first photo.

Just Google Feds selling out 500 ish bitcoins they took from some drug dealer when they raid his property. They want to make sure they clear out all of their wallets before they announce anynew legislation and laws which will force all crypto exchanges abide the law the same way as any other bank or financial institution or they will be illegal and prosecuted. You can't have this fantastic idea of complete freedom of decentralised independence from government forever. Unless you live in Venezuela, Bolivia or Zimbabwe where they just don't care.

The next phase is the 'dead cat bounce'
Price will rise as people buy back in because they are now getting a 'bargain' due to the drop.
Won't be long before we see the real falls

and that's exactly what they want they either allow you to run the business as usual but you will have to disclose all the data about your clients or they make sure that any exchange who won't do it will be operated against the federal law. As soon as that happens all the big "illegal" money will move out and that's what they want. If you dig deep enough you can see that Feds already started.

Exactly, there is no point to hold it and hope it will just go to 100k. I already dump it it all after I read that EU is preparing a law for all exchanges which wants to operate within EU will be required to do ID checks to identify all of the account holders and withdrawals to avoid tax frauds and money laundering. Meanwhile Feds quickly dumping all of their wallets as there is a similar legislation is already in the pipeline ready to pop the price.

Just sell it while there are some buyers the bubble just bursted...

Inside job, who wouldn't do it for 60 mil...

Just my two cents. Never buy falling knife.

Bitcoin in next 5 years will be worthless as other 1000 cryptos which are dying right now. Do me a favour and randomly pick some index and invest your funds into that instead. You will be better off guaranteed.
