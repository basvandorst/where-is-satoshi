Don't see why not. Let's say Apple pays for $10k worth of upvotes for a new iPhone ad to be on top of front page. Why wouldn't you pay $1k for downvotes, to bump it to middle of frontpage, if you believe Samsung will come and pay additional $5k of downvotes, to  get it off the frontpage?
Downvotes also have the benefit that none of the bounty goes to original poster, so curators make more.

That's a good point, a sybill attack, however, Yours would probably take a percentage of each upvote, so they would still be losing money, like 10% of the sum. They'd obviously need to tweak these parameters to find a sweet spot. 


Not really, all this would be probably done by bots, and happen in few seconds. 


I didn't suggest that. I gave example of spam, and what would mitigate it. For corporate spam, you'd rely on competing corporations. For non corporate spam, you'd rely on just irritated people. 
For non-spam, you don't really need the downvote incentives to work, as there would be no "non-natural" upvotes.

IP is the lowest layer, and what you would consider "the internet". On top of that you have TCP and UDP.

Not only is hardfork not a decision for developers to make, it's also impossible for them to make it. The network in the end always decides what code they will run. 
However, job of the developers it to make this decision easy on the users. 
Produce both options as best as you can, publish and maintain them both, until the hardfork window is closed, then discard the one that didn't survive.

Miners serve the big players, so they are on the same side as Coinbase, exchanges, etc. In a few years, a Coinbase sized company will be a joke, just as a private node is today. 
Promise of bitcoin is decentralisation, not democratisation, and that's a good thing, even if most people don't get it. Samsung, Apple and Google controlling 1/3 of hashing power each is the end game, and that's fine.

I believe in individual freedom, to the extent that it doesn't harm anyone else. So, no, I don't think anyone has any right to use violence to stop anyone else from voluntarily engaging in any kind of trade. I include gambling, drugs, prostitution and Justin Bieber CDs in that. I don't personally recommend some of those, but I don't believe in imposing my system of values on others.

Why do you like bitcoin? Is it because it gives you control over your money, and freedom to transact without a third party gatekeeper?
Then why do you want to take that away from your children?
If you want them to learn financial responsibility, you have to give them financial freedom. There is NO other way. Just give them some small amount, which won't be a huge deal if they lose, but give them the keys, and let them learn to use real world tools, like everyone else. If they're already teens, I'm pretty sure they'll figure it out about 10 times faster than you did.

It doesn't bother you that they're open? All I hear from these socialist philosophers,  are same objections to capitalism that Marx raised, and calls to implement socialism ASAP. Meanwhile, the most obvious questions, of how the system could theoretically work, without immediately turning into Soviet oligarchy, remains unsolved for centuries. 
Proposing to implement socialism, without clear solutions for those questions, is dangerous to the point of insanity. 


Yes, of course, it's not like capitalist disagree with that, or don't want to change it, in the same direction that you want. They just want to do it in a decentralised way, and actually have a solid theoretical economic / mathematical model of how to achieve it (to a high degree, they recognise perfect utopia is not possible).

I don't think it's possible to remove negative connotations from word "dark". Fear of the dark is very primal in humans. It will always symbolise a sense of danger, which nobody wants in their financial transactions. 
I put the darknet in the same category as Dark Wallet. It's just the name that someone gave it, there's nothing inherently dark in any network protocol. 
If you look at something like "Pirate bay", I might agree with you that you could conceivably completely change the meaning of the word "pirate", to just mean "people who share files on the internet". I'm still sceptical to the worthwhileness of that effort, but I can see it being possible. 
Difference is, most people rarely use the word "pirate" in it's original meaning, so it's free to change, which doesn't work for "dark".

No, bitcoin is about freedom, and freedom also means freedom to make bad decisions. You made a few and you got wiped out. Now you long for a system that will prohibit you from making bad decisions. Bitcoin is not what you're looking for, it will not bring back financial rules from the middle ages. 
So, take responsibility, look inwards and deal with your issues, because you will get freedom to make more bad decisions, wether you like it or not. Choice will be yours.

I'm definitely with you that it beats welfare, and I kinda agree that the market is a brutal beast, but not in a way that you think.
Free market unapologetically rewards the more competent and more agile, and crushes the weak, that is true. The mistake that I think you are making, is to think that the corporations and the rich elite are the strong ones. They're not. 
It's the poor, the hungry, who are the most competent and willing to really work their asses off to succeed. The rich are weak, they sit on their laurels, and in a real free market, they would be crushed in a very short amount of time. (IDK if you watched Scarface, but the rich are Frank Lopez, the poor are Tony Montana)
Whole point of the "system", or government, or whatever you want to call it, is to make you think that the opposite is true. That you are the weak one, needing their protection. You're not.
Just take the power away from the system that protects the status quo, and the poor will do great. Problem with basic income, is that you have to give more power to the system, because you expect this system to go get the money that will be given to the poor. Giving more power to government always backfires.

I'm not, it's really just reality. I'd love it if you could lift people out of poverty, but basic income won't do it. 
All that happens is that "the rich" just jack up the prices, and drain the new found wealth from the poor, leaving them even poorer. They won't produce more stuff, no new jobs, they'll just jack up the prices for the existing goods. If you try fixing prices, you get shortages for the goods that you fix. All of that has been tried and tested. It just doesn't work. 
Only way to really help the poor is to create a level playing field, where they can lift themselves out of poverty. They're not stupid, they don't need a handout, they just need a chance to get into the market, without a million and one government bureaucrats breathing down their necks.

Imagine this: PayPal adds bitcoin to their wallet, and you can keep dollars too in it, and convert on the fly when you need to make a bitcoin payment. 
Merchants wouldn't have to worry about fraud and they know that anyone with a PP account can pay them with it, so no reason not to accept bitcoins (and convert to USD with BitPay)
For users, since you only convert to BTC when you make a purchase, you don't need to take the BTC price volatility risk if you don't want to. 
PayPal would take fees, of course, but there's plenty of room, when you cut out the credit card companies.

The entire point of bitcoin is exactly to do what those currencies tried, but failed because they were centralised.

It's a strange type of cognitive dissonance, where people will rationally understand that what they're doing is right, but on some level they feel the urge to conform to societal standards and call it negative. 
They understand that there's nothing wrong with having a free market, where people can voluntarily trade drugs or whatever else, but they still go along with the government in calling it "black", "dark", or some silly name like that. 
Beginning of philosophy is to call things by their proper names, and reject the establishment's doublespeak. It's too bad that they don't understand what disservice they're doing to themselves, by self labelling as criminals, when they are not, by any rational moral standard.

Can't this risk be reduced by reducing the latency between nodes? IMO, the equilibrium is where the transaction fees cover the risk of increased latency due to a larger block. But since this latency can be reduced relatively cheaply by better connecting the nodes, and since it follows Moore's law, I would expect that block sizes will increase over time, and transaction fees will decrease. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 15:18:36
I'm really trying hard to not be rude here, but this is all incredibly wrong.


Obviously, in a centralised system, the agent that assigns the roles has absolute power. Only way to attempt to mitigate that, is to decentralise the selection of the central agent. You don't see a circular problem there?


What feelings? If you have a system where some agents have different privileges than others, you have a "privileged class". You're trying to pass accurate perception of reality as a mental deficit. It's insulting.


They can. Simply don't mine on ghash blocks. Rest of the network can orphan each and every one of their blocks, if they want to. There's absolutely nothing that can't be done in bitcoin, if you have a consensus of majority of nodes. 
Look into how bitcoin works.

Because it's not a problem. If you put your money in an experimental asset, and you have no technical knowledge, or ability to do basic due diligence, you lose that money. If there's fraud involved, then that's already illegal, and you don't need any more regulations. 
If you can't handle that, then go away, and come back in 5 years, when you'll be able to use it with no technical knowledge, and big reputable and safe companies will emerge.

IDK, and I'm just guessing here, but if miners don't discriminate against transactions, and their mempools are close to synced, they wouldn't need to rebroadcast all of the transactions included in the block. They'd just need to say "I included all transaction up to X and here's the header + hash". Other miners can then reconstruct and verify the block on their side.
If that's true, then there's practically no bottleneck, which is crazy.

To suggest that women or non-white people can't just pick it up and use it, and that bitcoin community needs to somehow work on luring them in (cookies?), is an insult to those people. We welcome them. We use the technology that makes it impossible for us to not welcome them, but we respect them enough to not think that they need us to hold their hand, before they can get involved.

There is a difference, however, between a $1000 in a US bank account, and a $1000 under a mattress in Zimbabwe. The same $1000 USD in Zimbabwe is worth less, because that guy can't use that to participate in the global markets. That's something that bitcoin can change.

Because they're not really selling them cheaper, since there are shortages. Prices don't really mean anything there, they're just tokens. In actuality, you get food proportional to how close you are to political elite. So, the price is what you pay at the spot + how much ass you kiss + how many favours you do. 
So, with the free market, even though the spot price may be higher, it actually is the price, and you don't need to do anything except pay. For most people, that's obviously cheaper, otherwise it wouldn't exist.

This is a huge issue, and we're wasting time, but ok, I'll bite. 


First problem, where it will fail. Not because water rights are privatised, but because property remains socialised, so whoever just buys the water rights, will destroy the water source, since it's not his anyway. That's NOT the free market.


Why? At certain price point, it becomes profitable for other companies to lay another pipe, and undercut the company that's raising the price. Problem, of course, is that state regulates who gets to lay a pipe, and lo and behold, it's always the same cronies. Again, not free market's fault you have just one pipe.


You're describing a monopoly, which is ONLY possible with artificial barriers to entry, raised by governments, to protect the big money. In a free market, consumers have the power, they select the company who provides better service, and that creates a natural incentive for them to lower prices and provide better service. If they don't, there's another guy who will, and consumers will choose him.
Disclaimer: these are all VERY SIMPLISTIC explanations, just to convey the general idea. Also, market forces are not immediate and perfect. If state removed all regulations around water tomorrow, and sold public land, there WOULD ensue a period of utter chaos, and it would take years, for market forces to produce good companies, that would provide good service at reasonable prices. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 23:19:35
The problem with goldbugs is, for the past 40 years, they were too lazy to explain to people what counter party risk means, so they simplified gold's advantage over fiat with magic words "intrinsic value". 
Bitcoin is a problem for them, because it destroys their main marketing buzzword, since it exposes "intrinsic value" concept as total bullshit. It doesn't mean gold is bullshit, just that the way they were selling it is. If they marketed it by explaining the actual advantage, which is no counter party risk, they wouldn't be in this pickle now.

It's not technically possible anyway. If you give the kid the private key, you can't control it, and if you don't, you did not give him bitcoin, you just gave him access to a centralised system. You might as well give him paypal account then. 
If you want security, give the kid a key with $50 in it, and explain to him that if he keeps that secured, there's a chance it will be enough to buy a new xbox, come july. I can guarantee it that kid will know everything there is to know about cold storage within a week.

It's not centralised in a sense that you have to trust a central authority with your money. Server architecture is a performance tradeoff, and not a bad one IMO. 
Bigger issue is, you still have to trust a central authority to enforce ownership. Just because you say that a CC represents my house, does not mean that someone will come protect that house from intruders if you show them that CC. 
It's a problem for both OT and CC, but I think OT are at least recognising it. How does CC deal with it? Decentralisation is not a silver bullet, you still have to deal with the real world at some point.

That will *never* happen. Anyone who understands what a 4096-bit private key is, will also understand the distinction. 


You are right here, but for a completely different reason. It's in widespread use in meaning "a small part of something", like "a bit of cake", NOT in meaning as unit of information. Since you didn't notice that obvious fact, be aware that you are looking at it from a highly skewed perspective of your own vocabulary (probably technical), and not that of an average person. 
As a unit, it's only used by a small minority of people with technical background, who are not easily confused. For the rest, it's vaguely familiar in that context, but certainly not a word they use in normal conversation. 


We can't just choose a random word. It must be something that already has at least some connotations connecting it to bitcoin. Bit has 2 advantages
* it's part of word "bitcoin", so it's easy to associate
* it's also used as "small part of something", so it's easy to comprehend it as "a small part of bitcoin"
"Bit" is not perfect, but you have to provide a better alternative, which I haven't heard yet.

Let's say you convinced me. But why not make this voluntary certification for companies that want it? Those who go through it, get to put government's seal of approval on their site, those who don't don't. 
Customers then only need to look for that seal, and not do business with companies that don't have it, or do it at their own risk. No geekines required, can't be simpler. 
But no, they won't do that. They'll **force** everyone to do it, and those who refuse, will be raided and shut down. And the only reason is that you're too lazy to go check if the company has a seal or not, so it's easier to just destroy all companies that don't have it.

It's not right. 
You have 1 bitcoin? You'll sell it when it hits $4k. Price will go to $5k. You'll panic. You'll buy 0.8 back. It'll crash down to $3k. You'll become depressed. You'll buy the next xbox to make yourself feel better. The world will start to fall apart, economy will crumble. You'll lose your job. But bitcoin is rising to $7k. You sell some to make ends meet. Now it's $14k, but you only have 0.6. Shit! You sell it all, to buy back at a better price. Next morning, you check the price, and it's $21k. FUUUUUUU. This is it, the dollar is collapsing, economy is in the dumps, it's going to a million, you buy back. There's a problem with the block size limit, blockchain can't handle this many transactions. Panic sets in, price plummets to $10k, but recovers to $15k. For the next year, it's slowly dropping to $5k, while you're spending it here and there. Still, you hold strong, with little you have. Price starts to rise, nobody knows why. $10k. $20k. Oil suddenly goes to $250. Gold jumps 30% in one day. $40k. $50k. This is it. Dollar is in hyperinflation. $60k. Everyone you know is giving blowjobs for half a satoshi. $100k. $200k. You're the king of the world, you're gonna be a millionaire! The president comes on TV, he says bitcoin is banned, all ISPs are ordered to block all bitcoin traffic, all retailers are prohibited to sell merch for bitcoin. $170k. European union says the same thing. $140k. China. $90k. You say fuck it, you waited long enough for some satisfaction, so you cash out, and buy a new car. It's a honda. Price bounces. $150. Economy still fucked, social unrest all over the place, government printing dollars like crazy. Nobody gives two shits about the ban. Everyone just wants bitcoin. $300k. All the talking heads are on TV, the president is talking to the IMF, the IMF is talking to the BIS, the BIS is talking to the president. They're all saying "don't panic". $500k. The president comes on TV and announces that all US government debts and obligations will be valued at $1M per 1BTC and US dollar is discontinued. Within a day, all major governments follow suit. Price of bitcoin is no longer quoted in sovereign fiat terms. 
So, yeah. Best case, you get a fucking honda. You're not filthy rich.

Complying with those regulations costs money, which ups the entry costs for new ISPs, and makes it more profitable for them to merge. So, you end up with one or few ISPs having a monopoly on the market, which makes it much more probable that they will break net neutrality, and get away with it.


Then I vote with my dollar and switch to an ISP that doesn't. That's the only way you can actually have the power to enforce net neutrality. Until OP's regulations create a monopoly, that is.

I don't see any reasonable indication, but if you do, ok, sorry if I was too confrontational. To me, if they didn't audit since november, it's probably because audits cost money and users didn't demand it enough.

No, exactly the opposite, it's a positive feedback loop. More it's perceived as store of value, more it's used for transactions, which makes it a better store of value.

Maybe. 
In general situations, you never ascribe to malice, what can be explained by incompetence. 
However, if you want to secure something, you **always** ascribe to malice. Assuming an "honest mistake" is just stupid.

Good question. 
For something to be good money, it needs to have following properties:
* fungability
* portability
* scarcity
* divisability
Currently, bitcoin is one thing on this planet that scores best in those properties. 
Those are the fundamentals, and the reason I invest. If that changes, I sell. If it doesn't change, people will eventually realise the value, and price will rise. 
Believe it or not, everything else is just noise. Nothing has ever come close to questioning those fundamentals. Of course, infrastructure is still buggy and small, so people will have problems with using bitcoin, and that will temporarily bring the price down, but that's investing. You have to invest in something before it's fully developed.

Anyone who ever worked in any kind of engineering company, has heard this kind of drivel a million times. 
Sales team goes ahead and sells a round triangle. Engineering tells management it's impossible to build. Management responds with this kind of stuff... "You can't see the big picture, you can't communicate, you have no vision, you don't understand customer needs, etc"
Normally in this situation, you just say "fine, but it'll take 3x the time", during which you half ass a square, while working on you own projects, and you quit the company 2 months before delivery date, to a higher paying job. Then you read in the news how they went bankrupt, 6 months later. Rinse, repeat. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:21:41
Well, it's as good as it will get. 
Example: you shop at overstock on a compromised laptop, and you process payment on a hardware wallet. If the payment address was spoofed, your hardware wallet will say "Do you want to pay X to random address?" and maybe flash red, instead of saying "Do you want to pay X to overstock.com?"
If you still go through with the payment after that, nothing can help you, but I think that's secure enough for anyone with a few brain cells.

Can someone ELI5 about "classic" and segwit? Does it include it, and if not, why not? Couldn't they get ~4MB effective throughput in "classic", if they increased the block size to 2MB and added segwit? 
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:28:45
You are right. I was using the term "hack" in a classic definition, as in "an expert who uses a system in a manner beyond what the author of it envisioned". 
However, it seems all dictionaries adopted the definition of what used to be a "cracker", or "someone who breaks into systems". 
I do, of course, still think the old school definitions of those terms are better, but that's probably a case of:
@_date: 2016-06-10 19:39:26
Fuck. I was bullish until I saw this on top of the front page. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:50:20
Of course, but saying it wasn't hacked is just stupid. Every hack is "just executing code", that's how hacking works.

A private key is just a random number, so it can be generated manually. However, to get the bitcoin address of a private key, you'll need software, because there's just too much math involved to be done manually. 
You can use several different implementations to do this, to make sure it's correct, and do it on an offline clean computer, that you never again connect to a network. Depending on paranoia level, you could also pull out any radios it has (bluetooth, wifi), and any storage (HDD). Or just destroy it afterwards.

@_date: 2017-01-23 22:56:45
It's controlled by people, but not through social consensus. 
For example, you wouldn't say that nuclear arms race is a consensus among countries to develop nuclear weapons. Rather, once nuclear technology is invented, arms race is a consequence of everyone acting in their own self interest.

Problem is that I, and majority of bitcoin community, don't have enough technical expertise, to evaluate if segwit is good or not. 
I do want to see bitcoin scale (LN would be great, if it lives up), and I don't want to see a fork calamity like ethereum. I also trust core, as it has not yet discredited itself, like the opposition has. 
Given all that, segwit seems to me like the best solution. I also support not rushing it, and being conservative in it's deployment. 
I repeat that my opinion is based on limited knowledge, and personal estimates.

You bear risk until you liquidate. If you mined in 2010, in order to sell at $5k, you had to take 7 years of risk. 
If you mined 1 BTC in 2010, and are still holding, you are right now NOT risking nothing, you are risking the current value of that bitcoin (~5k). It's an economic fallacy to think that just because you acquired an asset at low price, that you are only risking that low amount. Reality is that you are always risking the current value. 
Btw, I'm not trying to argue that this is fair, just explaining how investing works. Concept of "fair", outside of concrete ruleset, is retarded.

You know what a phone costs, you know it's battery life. You buy it or not, based on that. Why in the name of the holy fuck would you ever care what happens in between? Will they put a better battery in and mine bitcoin, or put a worse battery in and not? WHY would you care?
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:23:13
You don't understand what I'm saying. You KNOW the battery life of a phone, therefore you KNOW how much electricity it's consuming. You also know the price. 
If I could offer you a phone that's exactly like iPhone 6, with 10% less battery life, for $100, would that really be theft?

I would argue that it's worse than people assume. 
Using WinXP boxes as data entry terminals is actually not catastrophic, as long as you have a whitelist firewall on your network, to let them only connect to the central database that they're using. 
The problem is not that they didn't have money to upgrade from WinXP, it's that they're absurdly incompetent. Throwing money at that problem won't fix it, quite the opposite.

This is the common problem with sceptics. They get so used to being right by calling bullshit on extraordinary claims, that they develop an automatic response. 
I was listening to an old episode last week, in which they admitted they can't explain how QE works, but firmly argue there's nothing fishy going on there, and anyone who questions wisdom of the policy, must be a tin foil hat idiot. 
They just know that questioning QE is extraordinary, and that's against their religion.
