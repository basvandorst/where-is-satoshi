If you don't trust Bitfinex to pay back &amp; you trade your token for less than its "face value" that could happen. Certainly some people (likely including myself) will want what money they can get immediately rather than hope bitfinex pays out over time, but this boils down to "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush".


The market determines the immediate value of the token, but bitfinex would have a set price they'd pay to get their tokens back as they make a profit. It's essentially like a bond market. If you're patient (and trusting) you can redeem the full face value from the issuing company after a specified duration of time, or you can sell it for what you can get.

Witness data (the signature) spent from segwit addresses are put in a special place separate (segregated) from the transactions. In segwit transactions the witness data is discounted when used to calculate the total block size. So a transaction will effectively count as fewer bytes when calculating satoshis/byte, meaning you can pay fewer total satoshis and your fee rate will remain the same.

It's not like that. It's like saying that, then adding an air filter after you add 5 other things. I can tell you two things customers absolutely care about more than segwit: Uptime and customer support. What people really want is for their site not to go down every time there's high trade volume and to hear back from customer support when they have a problem. If implementing segwit gets in the way of either of those two things, 99.99% of customers would prioritize segwit behind scaling the site and customer support properly.

LN will be a contiguous network, but if there are 3 massive hubs with a lot of liquidity within their networks but not between them, this would be analogous to different private payment networks. The easier it is for regular people to use, the more centralized it will ultimately have to be. Which is fine. You don't have to use large hubs. But if you want to do easy fast payments they'll be available.

You should probably read about how BU signaling works so that you don't say 100% wrong things in the future.
EB1/AD6 means the current largest they'll accept is 1 MB, they'll take a larger block after it's 6 blocks deep in the chain.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:28:36
Technically that does help the network, although only marginally, and if your node &amp; firewall aren't configured right it may not help a all. 
Ultimately, if there is a fork, the market will decide. People will have both coins and can sell one for the other. If everyone supports core they'll sell their unlimited coins, if everyone supports unlimited they'll sell their core coins. It will likely be very chaotic at first, but in the end people will vote with their money.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:21:01
There is no "timeline" per se.
Most miners are following ViaBTC's suggestions detailed here: 
Which states that  after they acquire &gt;75% hashpower they'll move to the second phase: 


Each difficulty adjustment is performed every 2 weeks. So the earliest it could happen is a month after they reach 750 or more of the last 1000 blocks.

If you really believe one individual controls more than 50% of the hashrate you should sell all your coins now because regardless of whether or not BU activates it should already be worthless.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:27:46
Even if all of the BU nodes signaled for segwit it would still fall far short of the 95% required for activation. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:56:01
No...  No its not.  They're "discounting" witness data. It's the exact same number of bytes... 
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:29:41
At that point it probably won't matter. Core nodes/miners would be on their own chain, on which they should easily be able to acquire the necessary 95% without BU blocks to compete with.

Ultimately segwit itself will help in the short term, and if we can roll out an implementation of the lightning network in time that will help even more. Ultimately though, even with lightning, at some point in the future, we still will need larger blocks. Hopefully we can address this before it becomes an emergency again.

They're trolling. EB1/AD9999999 means they'll accept a block larger than 1MB after 9999999 other blocks have been mined on top of it. Effectively, if 190 years pass after the first &gt; 1MB block, they'll accept that. . . 
I suspect they're signaling this way to throw off some of the sites calculating support for BU. They're probably using a regular expression looking for EB and a number followed by AD and a number, meaning they would incorrectly interpret this as support for BU.

I'll break it down nice &amp; simple for you. The developers proposed a change. The miners don't want it. They're not running that code. Now they're running a different client. You're saying that's bad because some day in the future the alternative client might make a change to the software that might be bad, but somehow in *that* case the miners will have no option but to run it.

It should be possible to spend both coins, yes. The issue is that, at present, there is no replay protection. This means that if you spend coins on one chain, that transaction is valid on the other chain, and could result in your coins being sent to the same address in the other chain. 
A lot of this is up in the air right now. When this happened in ethereum, they were able to use contracts to determine which chain they were in to prevent replay attacks. Bitcoin's scripting doesn't work the same way, so we couldn't do the same thing, however people are working on methods to help protect against this in the event of a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:50:27

If they don't mine segwit, they still make money. If they don't follow what would have to be a second hardfork to increase the coin cap, they would still make money on the original unlimited chain. 
I know it if fashionable amongst some to point at unlimited and bleat about it but every discussion does not center around unlimited. Some altcoin with a higher coincap is a separate issue, surely you can see the difference?

42% of the last 144 blocks signaling BU. Did I miss something? 
How is BU "drawing its last breaths"?
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:52:43
BU removes the hard coded blocksize limit. If they start producing blocks larger than 1 MB, this necessarily will cause a chain fork. This has happened before and isn't a huge deal by itself, the issue however is that the community is divided and plenty of people on both sides would refuse to run nodes or mine on the other chain. 
Segwit is an "effective blocksize increase", meaning that technically there's' still a 1 MB limit, but in segwit transaction, the "witness data" or cryptographic proofs that you can spend the money, is separate from the transactions and isn't counted the same way as data in the main part of the block. It's still counted, but it's "discounted", essentially meaning that it counts, but it's counted as fewer bytes toward the total 1MB limit than it is. The specific discount applied is somewhat arbitrary, but the end effect is that we can fit more transactions in the block, and we eliminate transaction malleability.
Supporters of segwit would say this is safer than a hard fork. Supporters of BU would say this is just kicking the can down the road.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:10:10
Agreed. I remember the proposed 2MB + Segwit hardfork &amp; thinking "well, it's just kicking the can down the road, but at least we're doing *something*". Then it never happened. Then luke proposed shrinking blocks to 300kb...
If they don't want to move forwards, or even want to walk us backwards then it's time to start looking for other options. We all know that even with segwit we will need bigger blocks.  Segwit alone would do the same as classic. We'd have a few more months then hit the limit again &amp; start round 2 of the scaling debate. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:30:19
It's amazing how much you can spin this in your own head. 
Let's just base our decisions on "your guess" rather than empirical evidence though. It makes perfect sense that miners would hard fork to a client allowing larger blocks so that they could make smaller blocks. Nothing is wrong with your logic on that . . .

It makes no difference if it's pegged to the USD or not. This is an example. It's not applied economics, we're not talking about how to turn a profit on international currency trades. If I bought a Cuban cigar with US dollars, would I be selling my US dollar for Cuban Pesos, or would I, like the sentence I'm typing right now says, be buying a cuban cigar with US dollars? A currency with a floating exchange rate *COULD* magically always have the same exchange rate for US dollars. It's mathematically possible for this to happen, but this would in no way negate the fact that buying a product with money is buying a product, not trading currency. Or how about this? If I pay for a hot dog for $1 with Paper money printed by the Fed, and the man I'm buying the hot dog from is a constitutionalist and only uses coins minted by the government, and he takes my dollar to the bank to get quarters after our transaction... did I just buy quarters or hot dogs? What if he wiped his ass with the dollar and flushed it down the toilet later? What did I buy then?


You spent a paragraph explaining the risk/reward of holding currency in some volatile markets, but you did not explain how buying a thing is in fact not buying a thing, but instead buying a currency. 
I traded my Bitcoin for a product. That's all we know. You don't know anything about the internal operations at Bitmain. They *could* *immediately* sell all their BTC revenue for USD. That's a $100% possibility. But the thing is, you don't know that. You did assume that it might be the case. And if it were the case, *AND* if they paid USD to the fab that makes their chips, not Yuan, then "effectively" as you put it, the net result would be that they bought bitcoin (However "effectively" we're all already dead). Since you know none of this, we can discuss what did happen. 
Bitcoins moved from an address I controlled to an address they controlled, and a tangible good is moving from China to the United States. These things are facts.

So if I buy Cuban cigars with us dollars in actually selling my dollars for pesos? 
What about if I a Canadian book?  Selling my Us dollars for Canadian dollars? 
No.  I'm buying a product with a currency. Even if none of this were true,  your entire argument hinges on your assumption that Bitmain immediacy sells all the bitcoin they make,  which means they're investing millions developing hardware and maintaining mining polls for a currency they don't believe in.
Furthermore,  how do you allege to know what currency they use to buy their hardware?  Why not use Yuan, since they are afterall... in China.

Well,  if BTC hadn't exploded that would be true. I paid 3.4 BTC for a unit from batch 2, while batch 3 costed 2.8 BTC. So really I paid about $350 more...

Nope,  I sent them bitcoin. They may base the price on usd, but I did not sell. If I did,  Bitmain would have made 2000 Usd instead of a quantity of bitcoin that is worth about 2500. I'm not upset that they profited,  but let's be clear,  they're doing a lot better than they would be if I sent a wire.
@_date: 2016-06-17 04:25:03


You being wrong in the first place is what started this entire debate. You alleged I saved money, but you were wrong. I didn't save USD or BTC.
That said, it's absolutely worth 3.4 BTC to me. My complaint was about shipping delays, not the price. I'd be happy to have my 3.4 BTC go to a unit from Batch 3 that would ship now. 
Last &amp; possibly most importantly, Bitmain "pegs" the price to USD loosely at best. I bought an S7 after Mike Hearn went on his tantrum and paid $900 for the bitcoin I bought to buy the unit that was "pegged" to $1200 USD. Also, I just checked the receipt in my e-mail. The PSU has the price in USD in parentheses next to it, the unit itself simply says 2.4 BTC. And additionally, the network difficulty has as much to do (if not more) with the price of each unit as the USD/BTC exchange rate. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:58:42
That math is based on a lot of assumptions though,  as I'm sure Bitmain's is too. It's a gamble,  plain and simple.

I got batch 2, which ships the 20th, then batch 3 came out &amp; ships as soon as payment is completed. . .

There was not debate about whether or not it was **a** blocksize increase, but whether or not it should be **the** blocksize increase.

The difference is that the merchant pays visa. The customer pays the bitcoin fees. Merchants can lose customers entirely if "it's too hard" or "fees are too high" whereas using Visa they can elect to just take the hit themselves.
If I'm a merchant selling something for 20$ I might be willing to take $15 if that's what I have to pay in fees. 
On the other hand if I'm a customer and I see something costs .007 but it will be .002 in fees I might decide that's too much and it's not worth it. I'm not going to take the time to haggle with the merchant because of the network fees. It's not worth it for a yo-yo (or whatever).

That doesn't solve the issue of refund transactions in lightning getting malleated though, as the refund transaction typically isn't used, but even if it is, it's not until after the first has already hit the chain.

I'm not entirely sure myself, but I think you should be able to test this easily. Try it with tor on first &amp; make sure it works, then kill tor &amp; see if you stop lose connectivity. If you're still getting blocks/tx's after killing tor it's not configured correctly.
You might want to set some iptables rules to block non-tor bitcoin (and other service's) traffic too just to cover all bases.

Because it's implemented in a roundabout way as a soft fork, rather than a clean hard fork. This would be 100% fine IF we did not need to increase the block size, which we do. When and by how much is the topic of much debate, but it's very clear that it will need to increase. 
Since a hard fork will be necessary (And was on the core roadmap for July 2016 but never completed) many are suggesting that segwit and some form or larger blocks should be rolled into a single hardfork along with a number of other smaller changes. 
There's also a small but loud group of paranoid conspiracy theorists who will shout something about lightning network &amp; blockstreamcore blah blah, but that's always gonna happen no matter what's proposed.

Yeah not really though. Yes we passed segwit, but adoption is very slow. Now that Electrum 3.0 is out hopefully we'll see a rapid increase in Segwit tx's. 


I meant how long would 2MB base blocks need to be tested for you to say deploying them in production isn't "rushed". As long as segwit was tested?


You can make bigger blocks, but the scaling is not proportional to tx capacity. You can reach these extra large blocks with P2SH addresses because of the witness discount, but a block that would reach say 3 MB wouldn't have 3x as many transactions as a 1MB block filled with P2PKH tx's.

Yes. However it's not segwit if it's sent from a non-segwit address to a segwit address.
It has to do with what you have to do to redeem the transaction output. If it's in a segwit address already and you want to move it, then you can segregate the witness and get the discount. If you're sending to a segwit address (from a regular address), you're redeeming an output from a regular transaction.

I mean,  I guess nobody really knows. F2Pool signed that too, but they're open to voting for classic with block version. Several pools have said several contradictory things. 
It will all come down to hashpower.

Why is everything *bleed these days? Heartbleed was heartbleed because it bled the keys out of memory. Remote DOS is not bleeding anything...
That said, this doesn't appear to be malicious as much as stupid. If it were really malicious and intended to stop miners, they wouldn't come back online after a reboot. Even still though, remote unauthenticated control is pretty f***ing stupid.

Does this rule only apply to Unlimited/Classic?
@_date: 2017-04-19 16:41:01
You're referring to the people running pools. In a lot of cases (most?) they don't own the hardware. Wang chun doesn't own a single miner, yet F2Pool is one of the largest in the network. Miners are free to leave if he does something they disagree with.
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:30:13
F2pool is playing an april fools joke signaling Segwit + BU + 8MB
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:12:55
Because the other miners you're referring to don't support segwit. Maxwell proposed a method of blocking covert Asicboost without requiring segwit to be active. I'm sure those pools not signaling segwit would support this fix.
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:43:45
If bitmain was supporting SW and using Asicboost, segwit would disable their Asicboost. As soon as they *won* and SW activated they'd lose their advantage and profit.
Nobody hypothetically cares because it's a moronic hypothetical situation...
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:01:24
They do make money from mining LTC. If the price crashes they will make less money. If they believe segwit is bad, they won't signal for it on any coin they mine, in order to maximize profit.
That said, I really do wonder why they're not supporting it on LTC. On Bitcoin blockchain they say they're not supporting it until 2MB hard fork is released as well. No such agreement was made for LTC, so it's definitely curious. Clearly they've got some reason though.

Good question. I just signed into my old coinbase to see if I would get promoted for any new info. Seems to be just the same as before.

Even if bitmain signals segwit, and even if everyone's conspiracy theories are right and Jihan controls viabtc and btc.top, segwit still won't activate without bw.com and HaoBtc. Neither of them have shown any signs of supporting segwit as far as I know and they're not on the unlimited team either.
Nonetheless. Jihan does hold a lot of potential power as the only ASIC manufacturer selling units to the public, however if he actually did take advantage of that power in a malicious fashion &amp; start selling only to private pools, it would leave a vacuum that I'm sure plenty of companies would be quick to try to fill.

Yes, clearly all their customers will buy miners from their competitors who sell direct to consumers. Oh yeah, There's nobody. Until someone steps up &amp; sells miners to individuals (kinda like Bitfury said they would but didn't) they're not going anywhere.

I belive is more likely core fanboys are trying to "nip this in the bud". DDoS before they get a substantial percentage of blocks.

You're locking up money that can't be spent on people you're not directly or indirectly connected to. 
To use your "checking account"  analogy,  of they're not using the same "bank" as me,  I need to get back that money I put into "checking"  then put it into "checking"  with a different "bank" which takes longer than one normal Bitcoin transaction.
I've yet to see a good explained of this working on the real world. You can't transact more than the smallest channel between you and the party your paying without opening a new channel.  So many situations end up requiring closing and opening channels to handle varying transaction amounts.
@_date: 2017-04-20 13:26:45
The agreement was for a 2MB HF to base block size along with segwit. You can't just create some circular logic whereby b = a + b because b *is* a. 
An agreement was made and was not kept. Regardless of the terms of the agreement, the terms were not met, it's that simple. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 04:33:57
I can tell you that professional cryptographers have tested Bitcoin and ECC for years and found them to be safe and secure. Quantum computing introduces some new problems,  but the address is derived the hash of the public key,  and it is not feasible to obtain the key from the hash. 
Once coins have been spent though, then you can see the public key.

We already know why pools mine empty blocks. The allegation was that antpool mined more because they were using asicboost, which was incompatible with segwit. Since we now see they're mining segwit blocks that erroneous speculation goes out the window.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:45:53
Was the HK agreement that many core members attended and signed off on "behind closed doors" also? What's different about the two? 
If we don't like the next change they (whoever they may be at any given time) try to push through, we don't have to run their software. If nobody runs S2X nodes, S2X will not pass. I personally think it should pass, and the only thing making it "contentious" is the core devs digging their heels in, but either way, whatever you believe, making real change to bitcoin requires overwhelming consensus. Given how hard it is just to increase the block size I think it's extraordinarily unlikely anyone would even propose changing the inflation schedule, and we already saw how quickly the community rallied against chain-anchor before it was even a thing.
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:12:41


Personal attacks are a good way to get people on your side. You're pretty smart buddy.
So a few devs with commit access make agreements in secret slack channels to force changes on the entire userbase without bothering to measure consensus and you think that does not represent a "small group" in control? 
By the way, how do you define a few? There are 58 signatories on the agreement, only about 10 being miners. 
How many people have to sign off on this before you decide that it's got consensus? 
About five (Maxwell, Back, Wuillie, Corallo, Lombrozo) and suddenly we've reached "consensus".

@_date: 2017-09-09 19:29:20


Beyond doubling capacity (which segwit has not done), it does something much more important. It proves that bitcoin really is leaderless and decentralized. There's no single leader or committee that dictates the rules, but bitcoin is what the users believe it is. The passing of 2x in spite of cores efforts will show that some government cant just bribe or threaten everyone with commit access to the bitcoin github to kill the project. (not saying this is what is happening, but a real concern considering centralized development)

3) The passing of 2X would show that Bitcoin truly is decentralized. It's not run &amp; controlled by a small group of devs with commit access to the Bitcoin github, but something greater that can't be stopped by the "people in charge" of the leaderless autonomous currency.

Gaining increasing support and activating are two different things. If they weren't we'd already be running 2X since they have 93% support from miners.

I agree with everything you said except the last sentence. :-p
I don't think BCH "blew over". It's now its own distinct separate entity, just as it should be. We don't need to compare its success (or failure) to Bitcoin. They left peacefully.
As for 2x I have a different view. Unlike most of the people here or on the other sub, I don't think Bitcoin is doomed either way. If it passes, it proves bitcoin *can* scale and it doesn't require the permission of any authority figures within the community. If it  doesn't pass it proves Bitcoin is very very difficult to change (as intended). I hold my own coins, so either way it doesn't matter much in the long term.

"Honest" means they won't collude to double-spend. It doesn't matter if a node, or 51% of nodes are faulty and improperly verify a digital signature. That transaction will still be rejected by nodes that are not faulty. If however, a majority of nodes collude to 51% attack the network and reorg the chain, the blocks after the reorg will still be accepted by nodes that are not part of the cartel.

They didn't have a block to validate yet. Large pools watch the stratum servers of competing pools. When they see the miners being given new work, they know a block was mined, even though they don't have it yet. The validation doesn't take vety long,  but at 4 seconds after the previous block, it's entirely possible (even likely) they hadn't even received it yet.

Everybody would maintain access to the same repos they have access to today (Core to bitcoin/bitcoin and UASF to UASF/bitcoin) the only difference would be if core modified their client to accept segwit only blocks following a chain split, which is a question I think nobody can really answer right now.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:10:03
Core does not maintain chains, they maintain clients. Core does not maintain the UASF client.

I do understand your question. You asked why we would hard fork. The answer to your question is that we would hard fork in order to get larger blocks, which we can't achieve with our current consensus rules. I really don't know how to be more direct than that.

If there is a chain fork with no replay protection, and your transaction is replayed on the chain without segwit, you'll be spending your coins to what will actually be anyone can spend addresses on that chain.

Why was the addr_from added to the version message in the first place? It seems redundant since we're using TCP. I imagine they added it for a reason, not simply so that nodes can "gossip".

There will be a chain fork unless 100% of mining power is on one chain.


Not if no exchanges or businesses transact on that chain. There are plenty of coins with very little hashpower backing them, but there's no incentive for miners to switch to them because they're worthless and nobody uses them.


So will the new chain. Both chains will have fewer miners than bitcoin does right now, meaning even fewer people control even more.
Your real worst case scenario is if people start using the UASF chain and neither chain dies. There is no replay protection between the chains. After segwit actually activates on the UASF chain, those transactions will be valid on the main chain. Those transactions will be segwit transactions on the UASF chain, but on the main chain they'll be anyone-can-spend transactions. If you spend segwit on the UASF chain and it doesn't "win" economically speaking, you'll lose coins when we fall back to the regular chain. **That** is the worst case scenario. 
Realistically most people will likely (hopefully) have decided before a month is up and segwit actually activates, but you should be aware that the real worst case scenario is worse than you think...

@_date: 2017-05-30 18:51:41


If the UASF chain lasts for several weeks, that is to the point of segwit activation, but segwit is not active on main chain, then segwit transactions can be replayed on the main chain and will be valid anyone-can-spend transactions, since segwit rules will not be active. This means that if UASF must either be the main chain, or die by the time segwit activates on it, or any segwit transaction is at risk on the main chain.
Good job otherwise though. Calling any exchange that doesn't accept a contentious chain fork "hostile" is a good propaganda technique. Well played.

It is though. If they UASF they'll accept only segwit blocks. After the first non-segwit block is rejected, the next block signaling segwit will be invalid, as the hash won't be correct since the previous block was invalid. The only way this works is if a miner(s) agrees to ignore non-segwit blocks too. I've heard a rumor bitfury might. So then you've got 12.5% of our current hashpower on that chain.

They blame the developers because there was supposed to be a 2MB hard fork introduced along with segwit that was never delivered. Some miners are holding out signaling segwit until the hard fork is delivered and the agreement is kept. blames developers for not holding up their end of the deal. 
Segwit would fix this problem, as would a 2MB hard fork to non-witness data. In fact the hard fork would have a greater effect, as segwit grants an effective 1.7 MB block size (assuming mostly p2pkh tx's) instead of 2MB. 
Miners do like high fees, as they make more money, but if they were really operating as a cartel as people are alleging, they could still collect high fees with larger blocks by just implementing a fee floor. They could also make more money if they could handle twice as many transactions with fees 51% the size they are now.

You don't know how to read. They **very** clearly stated they support the new york agreement. If it does not succeed their own HF will activate with different rules.

You're right. The **people in charge** of the decentralized currency with nobody in charge should be making the rules. We shouldn't accept proposals from anyone else or give miners the choice of what to run.

42% of miners currently support BU/EC/WhateverWe'reCallingItNow.  It's entirely reasonable to assume even without any statement from them, that they do not support BIP148. That means that only 9% of Core/Standard miners need to mine then non-UASF chain for it to be a minority. Bixin alone has enough hashpower to make UASF a minority chain.

50k is sufficient at start. Including rent, wiring a building,  miners and misc cost.

Yes. Kraken is legit, and is one of the better ones.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:54:42
A similar thing. UAHF pushes the blocksize limit even higher, but more importantly it won't activate if Segwit2x activates.

I haven't heard of a bitcoin wallet being hacked. I mean you're not going to get around a trojan/keylogger, but the crypto hasn't been compromised. I think you're thinking of Ethereum and the parity hack. 
Exchanges are running web servers. They have open ports allowing connections to their servers. Your computer should be protected behind a firewall. 
Either way though, if you and an exchange are both using the same wallet software, and both have the same ports open with the same services running on them both wallets are as exploitable as each other, but the owner of the exchange could also just take your funds. No matter the circumstances it is better for you to control your own coins.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:19:07
Why can't it be both? How come any ideas from either side **must** be mutually exclusive? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:59:24
Every miner is a full node. So there necessarily must be at least as many full nodes as there are miners.

Check the ages of the pro-UASF accounts you see. A lot of them are under a month old. 
Similarly, the increase in percentage of UASF nodes has gone up along with an overall increase in total nodes about a month ago.
Seems as though someone is spinning up nodes and reddit accounts to influence public opinion.

It would really be much worse for everyone if their hard fork failed. Then there's petahashes of mining power left over to attack the old chain whereas if they're even mildly successful they can just go on mining their own chain.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:42:16


So you don't care about the block size. You're just afraid of a hard fork. **That** makes sense. I still disagree. But at least it's a valid concern.

@_date: 2017-06-02 14:25:02
It locks in at 75% and there are 4 more weeks for the other 25% of miners to update. I understand the political part of your argument. You'll never practically hit 100%, just look at ETC, but the point is technologically there's no need for a chain fork. There's plenty of time for 100% of miners to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:49:31
I repeat again. At the time the hardfork locks in, more than 75% of miners are allowed to signal support.
What you're asking for is a **requirement** that more than 75% support.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:54:38
How is lower hashpower good news and what does it have to do with a **user** activated soft fork anyways?

I'd call that a partial premine. I suppose it's semantics at that point though. Nonetheless I'm curious why you'd call it a scam.

I'm just wondering why a PhD cryptographer is advising at all that we should implement such an **obviously stupid idea**... Guess we'll never know.
Do you think the soft blocksize increase from 750k up to 1MB was obviously stupid too?
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:46:48


Where are you getting this figure? You can't assume that just because a pool is based in a country that all of the miners are in that country. Plenty of people in the US (too many) mine on antpool because that's how their miners come preconfigured.
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:33:36

@_date: 2017-06-01 20:38:47
I'm quite certain you have no idea what you're talking about. 
At the instant of any chain fork, any holder has coins on both chains automatically. The problem is that, as I said, there is no replay protection. Any transaction you send on one chain is also valid on the other chain.

Jihan makes a better and faster product cheaper than anyone else. That's why he's in business. If bitcoin mining weren't riddled with so many shady players for so long he'd probably have some decent competition. I'm still upset Bitfury didn't keep their word on selling their latest chips to the public. I kept hearing it was supposed to be early 2016, then nobody said anything, but they just didn't deliver...
Honestly though I'm surprised we haven't heard about some new players in the ASIC business given bitcoin's price and position in the headlines lately. If it keeps on at this price I feel like we'll definitely be see something soon.

Segwit is incompatible with asicboost, but it does not invalidate asicboost. A miner could still choose to mine blocks with no segwit transactions in them using the current segwit implementation and still use asicboost. 
What they're talking about prioritizing after milestone 1 alpha would block all forms of asicboost, with or without segwit transactions.

I've heard some people say they've had issues with coinbase lately. My only grip is their fees (I just paid $77 in fees for one Bitcoin).
