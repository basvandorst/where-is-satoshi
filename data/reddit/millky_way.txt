Yeah ... and it’s maybe not a good news ..
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:46:53
For a non technical guy like me, can you explain what it means please. It’s a good thing right ?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:25:26
This is amazing. The network needs all the help it can get before the LN is operational !
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:04:29
Interesting, I also think that we are gonna see another bull run soon. I'm just curious why the BTC-DOGE chart would be a good indicator of altcoins cycles ?

Yeah I know that, i will HODL don’t matter what happens, I see those correction as opportunities like many. 
But you have to understand that for a majority of those who bought from 10000 to 19000, this harsh correction was saw as the end of the world. 
I was just saying that the second part of the correction, the second bottom, was yet to come and that those who didn’t sold, who « survived » the first, will have a hard time. 
I am not a native english speaker, so I don’t know the subtilities of this language. I thought that « dip » meant bottom.

First of all, investing in Bitcoin is a good descision and the timing is pretty convenient although, remember to not invest what you can’t afford to loose. 10K seems a lot to me but I don’t know how much you have in fiat. 
There is 3 things that I consider will affect the price of Bitcoin in the short term :
1: On Christmas and new-year dinner, people gather with family and friends and you know that people like to brag about how much money they’ve made with crypto. This can encourage their friends and family member buy Bitcoins (this is what actually happened in ThanksGiving with a huge surge in the price of bitcoin). 
2: People nowaydays want their fund to include crypto investments and on the begining of every new year, a lot of funds try new investments for the year to come. Therefore, imo, there will be huge institutional money comming to the market in January.
3: Nevertheless, you have to take into account that some of the big players are waiting for the new year to take take gains in order to avoid taxes. However since the price has fall this much, I don’t know of they would still like to sell their positions. 
Some predict a mid term target (1-2 months) of 50/70K per Bitoin, and are very bullish since the LN is comming ... but many analysts are saying that the correction is not over yet and that the price will fall even further (to 10/9K). 
So either you play with the devil and wait a little more or you invest right now. I would suggest you to wait until it reaches 12/11K and then go all in. For me, it is the best time to buy in, you should consider yourself very lucky. 
(Sorry for bad english, I’m actually french)

Small but well coordinated groups can do a lot of damage. In fact, they often outsmart large but uncoordinated groups.
Bcash shills are a stupid minority yet they are extremly dangerous and not to be underestimated.

We have mainstream attention but we are lightyears away from mainstream adoption 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:37:59
Trust me, turn off your brain, HODL and everything will be fine
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:02:17
Yeah but why ? The precedent crashes were caused by events like the MtGox fiasco, China Ban, Bcash ... here we just have big whales trigering a panic sell, nothing has changed since bcash was added on CB ... I just don’t see any justification for a bull market. 
Anyway, the price will come back and this will be history. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:12:49
Denial or possibly anger
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:29:19
Just to be clear, I am not trying to predict the future price movements by looking in the past. 
I was just amazed to find almost the exact same sentences I see everyday on this sub on 4 years old threads 
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:22:39
Stop picturing the 1% as the evil elite that owns our lives and wants to own the world and eat your childrens ... 
The top 0,1% of the wealthiest individuals on this planet are people like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma, Jeff Bezos ... people that are deeply philanthropic and that really want to change the world in a better way ...
We should be thankful to have them.

Damn, I wish I had looked into bitcoin back in 2014 ...
 Anyway, I’m in for the long term and I definitely think I will see a 100K+ Bitcoin. Might be in 4 months, might be in 4 years, doesn’t matter ... I’ve got plenty of time 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:52:04
Yeah ... I’m starting to get bearish too and since i’m always wrong, expect the bear market to end soon 
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:25:16
Well, on the threads dating from 2014, they talked about the 2011 and other drops like we talk about the 2014 right now. 
Maybe in 5 years they will talk about this one ... who knows
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:30:07
Bcash below 0.10 BTC ...  Best news of the day
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:20:40
Who is still selling ? Are there still weak hands after 3 months ? How can you sell bitcoin at 7K ... grow a pair
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:00:23
Thanks, that’s exactly what I needed 
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:17:20
5 years for me
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:13:42
These threads were oddly optimistic after months of bear market ...

From how technology is evolving, we might not be dead by 2140 ... 
Plus, this was a good post until the EU explosion thing ... 
I live in France and I can tell you that things are way more stab’e than American or Russian media want you to think. 
There is no way we will get back to closed borders, different currencies, tarifs ... 
Even if the current EU were to collapse, we, France would make another deal with Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and all our close friends. We are just too interdependent now. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:10:51
Yes, these are the most propitious times to accumulate and create real wealth. If you believe in the long term, you have all the time in the world
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:41:24
Why ?
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:46:15
It could end in 2 hours, 2 months or 2 years ... who knows ?

Spacex is not listed, only conventional investors can put their money in ... otherwise, yes I would, just like a lot of people, have put a sh*t-ton of money in. 
Btw, I don’t recommend investing in Virgin Galactic 
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:09:16
If you are worried, look at the Bitcoin history, it has survived much worse than this ... 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:51:32
Exactly ! We have more room to go down and we might stay low a long time ... Still extremely bullish on the long term, HODL and accumulate !
