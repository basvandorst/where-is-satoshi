Unless they are using hacked paypal accounts to pay people I noticed they always sent me paypal money everytime I sent them bitcoins, although they did charge me their fee and also had Paypal deduct its fee from me too so its waaayyy too much fees.

I actually told my BOSS about NOTEPAD+ And omg she loves it.  It formats all the text file data automatically so she can read it.  I'm so downloading it.

It's about time.  The elusive Satoshi is from there.

Wonder if I should buy 100 of them now while it is still cheap as an investment so that when it becomes $100 or more each, I will be happier.  I should of bought tons of Bitcoins back before 2013 when it was about same price at $13ish.  If banks are talking about Ethereum blockchain like this, you know it has a strong future.

Man I wish I can do what he can.  Just looking at that site gave me a headache with all those hex and private key talk.

I regret not buying them when they were very affordable.  Before it sky rocketed I think it was at $34. Darkweb probably had something to do with it's price skyrocketing.  Wonder why satoshi doesn't come out from hiding now that his Bitcoins have a lot of value.  He shall be rich and have his face put on Time Magazine. I bought 1 btc right after the Bitfinex hack went value went down and noe value is back up again so I profited.

How will Quantum Computing get around the Schrödinger's cat problem? When Quantum state is observed it will collapse into one possibility. Update: I just read they are taming the cat problem by using entanglement which is a mystery itself.

They sent me money from different PayPal accounts each time I did transaction so I wonder if they are paying people with hacked accounts.  They are Russians.

Your correct, I actually ended up loosing lots of money when I thought Monero and Ethereum were going to increase in value but they both fell pretty badly and now I am so upset about it--that I don't even want to go check the rates to see if they gone up.

I like that advice of yours man, but they say risk and reward go hand in hand.  The higher the risk the better the reward.

Glad to have people like you making a difference and helping people find these scams.

In 2008 I had an account with Bank of America and they always kept rearranging my transactions so that they first processed the card transaction I made instead of my cash deposit which I know I first made.  This guaranteed an overdraft fee.

How do you even convert Bitcoun to cash? I have 20k saved, and would live to put half that into bitcoin as investment.  I however fear I won't be able to turn that bitcoin to cash without risking loosing all coins.

Not just ugly, but annoying.  The login lock protection was hard to disable.  Every time I logged in, it always sent me am 3mail requiring me to confirm its me. I like extra security, but they really need to make things modern and friendly.

How can they shut down Bitcoin? It is decentralized and isn't just stored in one location.  Are they gonna infect every computer in the world to guarantee malware can erase all bitcoins?

Bitcoin to Paypal mixes well, but not the other way around.

Just don't use them for very huge sums.  They may just take it all.
