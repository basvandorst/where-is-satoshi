You will be waiting for a long time. Any devs rage quit because they did not listen to the users are worth to be relied on. 
You must  not be out of your basement much for thinking a small group of people you got are the smartest, brightest people on earth.

Bitcoin value is created from its utility. There is no instrinsic value. Hence any artificially limit to raise fee will kill its utility. 
Many morons does not see that block reward only matters if bitcoin value is retained or increased.

Amir Taaki? Really? 
I have no doubt he is a talent coder, but he is a nut case. Any early bitcoiners know this. Put him and Luke in a same room and we will have apocalypse.
