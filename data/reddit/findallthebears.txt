It's really really *really* not a currency. Regardless of tx and ln, it's not a currency until it's $ is stable. Without a something to back it (I dunno, maybe with a centralized financial body that can guarantee it's value?)
it's value depends solely on demand. And when demand is mostly due to its price, you have a pretty basic circular relationship for volatility

I dunno. Got a weird feeling about this. To drive up the value of btc by this much, someone must have bought a lot of bch.

Not saying it's a bad thing, because I'm not sure that it is, but you should probably append:

With btc, it's a bit less of a concern, but still valid:

You wanna show me some serverside code that hashes the mnemonics before storing it, or are we just supposed to take your word for it?

No matter how strong your security is, nothing is more secure than not being a target in the first place.

So you're saying that the Lumi wallet is *not* sending plaintext mnemonics to your server?

Sorry, but my understanding is contrary to what I believe you mean by "seduces."
If you're using seduce to imply that the coerced him into doing, then yes, that is entrapment. But that doesn't really follow the rest of your comment. 
If you mean persuade, then we should discuss. Because the law is


It really doesn't at all seem like he was persuaded at all. He was offered a deal and he took it, thus committing a crime willingly and with intent. 
Edit: here are some sources:


("It is permissible for law enforcement agents or officers [or persons acting under their direction, suggestion or control] to provide opportunity for the commission of a crime including reasonable, though restrained, steps to gain the confidence of suspects.")

Tska, whatchu bristlin for, champ?
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:40:01
I dunno, but none of this seems like entrapment so far.
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:10:36
Unfortunately for our friend, no. Intent isn't about what your original plan was. As soon as he agreed to whatever it was, he was doing so willingly. The only way it's entrapment is if he is pressured to commit a crime he otherwise wouldn't have committed, or if he performed a reasonable effort to be sure that what he was doing was not a crime. 
There was a really great comic for this, but I can't find it.

@_date: 2018-02-23 03:41:19
It's not at all entrapment: 
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:49:09
The kind of passing comment where a normal law abiding person would have stopped, since it was in a text. Further, the &gt;$10k that was mailed to him was not a passing comment.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:49:15
Hmm, that's a good point about the mailing of greater than agreed upon funds. I think it's going to boil down to this: 
Could he have declined to execute the trade? I would think that if he's willing to perform something legal up until a certain value limit, and his client mailed him above the illegal limit, a reasonable law-abiding person in that position would decline.
Ignorance of the law regarding value limits doesn't constitute a defense. I think the fact that it was mailed, and the extended time / commitment involved to returning the funds might be arguable that some pressure was applied, but I don't think it'll be enough to *prove* entrapment.
