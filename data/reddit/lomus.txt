Bitcoin does not do politics

Any acid free paper in these kits or are you ok with the wallets rotting inside the plastic? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:41:13
It's a scam,  you have to put in another 0.05 to get the 0.1 out.

Why not 'm'  'bit',  mbit?

So what happens when a block goes over 1mb?
@_date: 2013-09-21 14:41:44
Sure send them over.
Or sell them on localbitcoins.com

I hoped you used acid free archive paper and decent ink!

Bitcoin purchases for me go like this. 
Beginning of month buy BTC and give myself some spending allowance from that,  say 20gbp.  Now I add that to my spending fund (not my savings fund that's a different cold wallet). 
Now the longer I leave the spending the more I can buy with my BTC,  so if I buy at the end of the month I get 20 percent more product,  it's not the banks that give me that incentive, it's the bitcoin community. 
There is your bitcoin as a transaction currency incentive, you just need to change your way of thinking.

Wasting electricity and helping kill the planet faster for anarchistic and selfish reasons.
Ami doing it right?

So much negativity.
For every loser someone wins.
If you don't trade you cannot get experience.
BITCoin is your coin, do what you want with it when you want.
Just because you make a loss do not presume everyone else is too.

Lol I thought the UK was a nanny state,  I really hope the government does not stick it's nose in and stink up this new found freedom.

depends on how much acid is in the paper, I don't think light bleaches it, the acid would eat it over time though.  I think building a laser etching device (co2 laser) and etching titanium is a good option if you want to pass down the generations.
Cheap paper can start to rot after a short while (2 - 5 years or so depends on paper), though laminating it might slow it down but I am not sure.

I don't trust it.  What's to stop some malicious code being rolled at at some point please via an update, can someone educate me please?

Its safe.  Just choose someone to sell to who has a high rating and done a lot of transactions.
Its easy to use so start reading up!

Your point is legitimate. 
There is no fiat incentive other than when it's useful to buy things with no chargeback risk. 
For example digital items. 
Other than that people seem to be saving for a rainy day.  In itself this is incredible. 
I have NEVER saved, always lived month to month in overdraft making the banks very rich indeed. 
Now I have regular savings in bitcoin, I have never felt so unstressed.

I need to see the pizza itself not the box, as I audit the topping amount on bitcoin pizzas. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 22:35:02
I am really really sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2013-08-03 14:16:29
At least they tried.

Localbitcoins margins are too damn high compared to bitstamp or the ilk.
