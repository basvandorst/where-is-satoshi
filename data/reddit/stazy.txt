The argument put forth was that those issues were caused by people using bitcoin, not a flaw in bitcoin.   My response is that, the people using it are a key element in it's implementation as they are the greatest threat to it's adoption.    If the system is too complicated for general people to actually use and understand, then it really can really never see full adoption.   The average person will not understand mining, or transaction fees or anything else like that. They just can't grasp it.   
Currently, they can understand that if they earn a dollar, they have a dollar.  Try explaining a 75 year old the complexities of transaction fees so that they can understand why when someone sends them 0.01 BTC that they only received 0.0075.

i think these types of post sum up my point; 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:38:10
and then you need a dns type system to translate that, which means there needs to be a centralized place to create and store that information. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:27:23
but it requires humans to use it.  It is only as good as it's weakest point, and when that's humans, we're setting the bar pretty low.   
Bitcoin itself, without implementation by humans is actually pretty useless.

I mean a billion people can all get in at fractions of a bitcoin and a low rate if they so chose to.   But there has to be a value proposition to the product.   The hodl movement is restricting the number even more. Sure it's causing the price people are willing to pay to go up. That doesn't remove the ponzi scheme like characteristics. 
Your question does sum up why it's a ponzi scheme. It continually needs more people to keep the price up.  
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:50:36
I've been watching bitcoin, and actively traded some for years.  The more I look at it now, the riskier and malformed it seems.    It really is a ponzi scheme at this point.  Ya, there's something there, but the value is based on what other people are willing to pay, and the more people that play, the more the value goes up.    It simply doesn't follow the metrics of good investing.   
Reading many of the comments in these threads paints a VERY scary picture.

The shipping containers are a thing due to cooling requirements and ventilation. They're also convenient and easy.  
The critical factor is the time it takes to shutdown and transport isn't worth the effort of doing it. The downtime costs too much. It may make sense to transport an abandoned container to a new location to have it ready when a new line of miner comes out.   That's about the only situation where it makes much sense.
There are container outfits in town here. It's not because they're cheap and easy to cool. Not because they can be transported

there's a ton of good information here about how supply and demand of power works.   
each source is priced differently according to various factory.  pollution is more of a bi product than a determining factor, but there is a correlation.    Solar and wind need to sell their energy while they can produce it, they are therefore willing to take a lower price than NG/coal.  in a similar fashion, NG/coal can scale up and down rapidly to meet demand.  They therefore demand a premium per MWH for that ability.  Nuclear doesn't scale fast, but it produces a lot of power, so they're happy to make a decent rate.  
On the other side of the table, you have the utility who purchases from all of these different sources.  They are naturally inclined to purchase from the cheapest sources.   
It's all pretty simple really. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:31:23
What mining operation is going to shutdown to move.  That doesn't make any sense. It would take a very strong argument to dump a large capital investment in the power infrastructure for a megawatt sized operation, stop mining for hours, drop more capital to setup again for a lower cost power supply. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:43:17
you should, that way you can realize the loss and write it off.   You can't do that without selling.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:50:51
horse shit.  You can lookup energy production capacities.  The pricing is determined by demand, but there are base loads.  The pricing is based on how easy it is to scale up and down.  A nuclear reactor doesn't scale with demand very easily, so it provides base loads.   Sources like solar and wind, which are time of day and weather Dependant price their power low so that it doesn't go to waste when it gets used.  Natural gas is easier to turn up and down, it produces large emissions.  
Many many areas still use coal and natural gas to create electricity.  Increasing the demand just increases the load on the dirty forms if there isn't enough load on the system.     
medium to large mining operations also require cooling, that adds another 30% to the required energy.  
One of the only ways that mining bitcoin can be green and free, is by using it for space heating, it's especially "green" in places that use electricity for their heating.  The heat produced by the miners offsets the cost of electricity. It basically becomes "free" mining.  
But you can't honestly tell me that when there are mining operations that have 2 Mega Watts worth of power usage, operations that pack power density so heavily into a small little space, that it's in any way shape or form, green.  And there aren't just one or 2 of these places, there are tons.   
If you take the current total hashing power, 12,178,922,942 GH/s, and using the most efficient miner out there,  S9 @ 14 TH/s @ 1.6KW.  you get approximately 1,391,877 KW, or 1.3 Gigawatts of energy being used.   That's an absolutely staggering number.  even with cheap power rates of say $0.05/ KW, that adds up to $70,000/hr, or 613 Million a year.

@_date: 2017-12-15 14:11:14
so what you're saying, and exactly what I stated, is that mining is actually using more power and/or $ than what I calculated, so it's therefore worse. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:39:12
bitcoin loading doesn't change.  so being able to move in and move out bitcoin loads aren't a thing and never will be.   Any miner wants the thing to pay for itself ASAP, and that means running 24/7,365.25.   It doesn't use extra energy, it uses baseline nuclear and hydro only.   
I never claimed bitcoin will provide that demand.  Andreas made that claim.   I made the claim that the way the energy market works, bitcoin will never be powered by solar or wind because it is so volatile.

It depends on your current situation, if you were a really early adopter and have 2000 btc kicking around, something like this would allow you to pay your bills online.  
It may be a little more expensive now but these sorts of services will become much more useful to people with large stakes in BTC when they choose to spend it.  They're also a nessecary first step in making btc more prominent

yup they can be.  They can also be linked to your own address if you wish.  If I was bright enough to become an early adopter 2 years ago and had say 200,000 btc sitting somewhere, I'd strongly consider using an ATM to personally exchange them for cash.  At that point, one could then decide if they wanted to buy more.

Why would he need to buy more. Why couldnt someone simply load one adress, print it to 1000 coins, sell them at face value. The public key would match the denomination, the private wouldnt match the public key, and until someone tried to use the pair, or the creator emptied the coin, no one with the coin would be the wiser. 
Its not counterfit proof if the creator can make fakes and multiples

I don't quite know it all yet but basically it requires having either some cash or bitcoins in an exchange.  Someone goes the the machine, places an order.  It initiates either a buy order if it's cash on the exchange ortakes some out of your account.  You can either take a cut of transaction fees or you can mark up the price of a coin.  Coin prices vary wildly from exchange to exchange.  There's nothing saying which exchange your atm is using.  You can set your price, similar to local bitcoins.  It can be a formula, such as mtgox price +X%, or it can be a straight 2$ fee.  up to the individual operator to decide how they want to play it.  The other way to make money is to list your price at that of an exchange that's usually higher.  For example, list Mtgox price but be able to buy elsewhere.  
The operator opens the atm and takes the cash out.  The frequency depends on how much it gets used and how much cash you want to keep in there.    If it breaks, it's the operators responsibility.

The only reason for people to go from BTC to CAD at this point is if they have a a huge stash and want to start slowly cashing out.    There really isn't much currency exchange being done with it inter countries.  
I had to make this decision when I bought an ATM.  Ultimately, I ended up going with a lamassu because I didn't feel the extra cash to go to a robocoin (or the fees for the mater) or the bitaccess was worth the extra risk for the reward of dispensing cash.

every time you trade, it will be recorded as a trade.  If there are any fees, you can write those off.  
Trade 1. Buy 3.77@ 645 
trade 2. sell 3.77 @ 700
you would take the  volume X amount.  Subtract trade 1 from trade 2.  that give you your net income.  Record that.  Record your trading fees.

3 questions with follow ups depending on answers! 
Thanks guys
1) How does a key get associated with an address.  My understanding is that there would have to be a master record somewhere.  
2) With regards to storage of keys, are they also stored in double sha256?
3) Who creates the work for the miners.  It would have to originate somewhere.

There are 2 different hosting solutions.  Way back when, they offered a plan where they'd send your miner to kcmcolo.  I don't believe they still offer that.  What they offer now is a paid per g/h hosted solution.  Which means you don't own the miner, they do.  They're not shipping it anywhere.

It depends on how the order is structured.  Some times people will accept a partial fill, whereby their order is completed by putting small portions together as they become available.  There's an option for "All or none" which means that the order has to be completely filled to be executed.  So there could by a buy order for more than an ask price, yet the asks are not enough to execute the order.

It would also open up a whole other can of worms based on how it was stored.... was it stored as btc, or as USD? what happens to the change in value over the time.  Would users who made mistakes try to get backtrack if the value went up?  If the transaction was in USD and the escrow holds BTC, does escrow refund the difference in BTC based on current exchange rates, or the exchange rate when the order was made.

the actual internet occurs mostly over fiber.

ugh... you have to do a MUCH better job of reading... that chart came from the bfl.po.tz or something like that site..... The data is not accurate.  It's submitted by users if they wish to submit it.  and ANYONE can submit data to that site.   It probably gives a little insight, but to take it, and extrapolate it, never mind take it as the holy truth is beyond rediculous.  Not just, but i the guy's logic is so far out of touch....  
1st, he count's 90 boxes, then makes the ASSUMPTION that that's all they ship in a day.  
The next ASSUMPTION is that each box only contains 1 order and 1 unit.  
There is NO WAY to take his logic seriously, some of it's alright, then he makes a wildly unpredictable assumption and claims his predictions are accurate even though he's using flawed data....  rediculous

but really.... what did people expect with devices that could be bought off the shelf and weren't limited in quantity... That's the way the market works.  What people are forgetting, is had they delivered earlier, the difficulty would have risen earlier aswell...  
The Thing that will make miner profitable vs unprofitable will be based on their location due to power costs.  A place with 0.65$/kwhr will be able to hold on longer than a place with 0.15$/kwhr....  And places that have to add air conditioning into the mix will be higher.  For someone like me who's on electric heat in the winter anyways, if I run a few KW through a miner or through a coil, doesn't make a difference.... my house still gets heated, so theoretically, I'm really only paying for that power for the miner during the summer mths.

you missed a decimal in there.  
The transaction fee is 5%.  So if someone buy's 10 BTC. The fee is .5.  Out of that 5, after the machine is paid for robocoin gets 0.25 and you get 0.25
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:05:42
Wouldn't the best way be to setup a rule that they can only send BTC to/from a certain address?  It's similar to what BF/WE did.  your Bitfunder address could only send to your WeExchange account.  Meaning you needed 4 pieces of info to be able to send out of the account.  
It's not fool proof, but it would buy you some time if you didn't have all the passwords stored in the same place. 
@_date: 2013-08-03 14:31:28
they've said they haven't used the pre order money.  Everytime they get a unit out, the cash associated with that unit gets released into their coffers.  
To get funding from an independent financier, they want collateral or some proof that there's a market for these things.  If they have a few million in pre-orders with the cash set aside, a bank or private investor is much more likely to invest in the company.  
@_date: 2013-08-03 01:58:22
how so?  I mean we really have NOTHING to go by in terms of number of units ordered.... There was a lot more orders when btc had all the media attention and people started to jump on the band wagon.  We can very loosely follow the unoffcial pre order page, but i mean loosely! I wouldn't be putting any faith in extrapolations based on that data.... especially when production rates by unit vary so much.  
speaking of data, I'd really love to see the bfl forum site stats, it seems as though the userbase has really dropped off.... my guess is that most of the people on there had very early orders and as soon as they got them, haven't been around much unless they have an issue.

Avalon Batch 1 - 300 units @ 65GH = 19.5 TH
Avalon Batch 2 - 600 units @ 65 (some might be more) = 39 TH
Avalon Batch 3 - 600 @ 65 = 39 TH.  
Since late June the network rate has gone up over 220 TH.  It wouldn't be crazy to assume most of that was due to BFL shipping long boards.  The only catch would be if someone was creating their own miners and not advertising it in anyway and was making HUGE amounts of power

one of the pictures showed something like 90 boxes ready to go out... and that was only one of the shipment that day.  What was in those boxes, I have no idea.  
Another one showed 50 some odd boxes in the back of a USPS truck and it was marked as the 2nd shipment of the day and that was a while back.  
I'd put my estimates more around the 250/day mark IF they have enough parts....

Caring means you put more rational thought into your decisions because you are interested.  This is opposite to the "gambler" you're mentioning.  It's actually the opposite of suggesting "justification of unnecessary risks".   It means you put more thought into it before entering into the risk.  saying you can afford to lose is it is a sure fire way to lose. 
As I said, it's a different strategy that isn't for everyone.

the fees can be hidden in otherways.  Each ATM has their own exchange they deal with, but the pricing can be separate.  They don't have to charge a percentage, they could just mark up the rate.  The way I had thought about doing it was buying on one exchange, but listing the price from say Gox which is typically higher.  Each exchange is different.  
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:39:19
Robocoin charges you something like 50% of the commission on every transaction.  The biggest thing you need to factor in is floating the machine.  It takes a few days for transfers to go through... say 10 day for example, by the time you take cash and transfer it back to the exchange.  If you think you'll do $1000/day of exchanges, you need a float of 10+ K so that you don't run out. 
If you're in the US, there's all kinds of laws, including the requirement of a bond and other things.

I'm sure serious traders are well aware of how the market works.  When you ask yourself, how high will this stock go, you're really asking, how much is someone willing to pay for it.

I've got some cash into one.  I'm not a big fan of the term ATM. Though.  I think that's where a lot of the stigma comes from govt's with them.  If they were considered "terminals" I would think there would be a lot more flexibility.    For instance, many places such as malls and office buildings have a contract and exclusivity agreement about having only their ATM's in a location.  The logical property manager would then say, look we have an agreement in place for ATM's already.... then it's an uphill battle explaining how it's different.  But if they were marketed as "terminals", i think it makes it easier to get them into many places. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 14:34:00
the goal is 10, but the difficult tries to adjust so that it's 10... if we're getting ~30% increase that means we're going through the blocks 30% faster and 30% of 10 is 3... which means we're going through them in 10-3=7 days
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:46:12
because when you spend 100K on a car, you actually have the potential to drop the value quite substantially.  So while it may be a current equivilent of say 100 BTC, by the time the transfers actually go through, it could mean 120-130 BTC to actually get that amount of USD

but those services still rely on the supply and demand prices.  It's doesn't work like you're thinking it does.  There's liquidity issues with BTC right now at the larger volumes.  For 5 or under, you probably won't notice a huge change, but for large volumes, it certainly can have an effect

@_date: 2013-08-19 01:43:41
no, i'm pretty sure that's completely wrong.  They aren't able to access the funds for an order until it's shipped. The reason they don't have the BTC is because a payment processor was used.  They only took USD, but the payment processor converted the client's BTC to USD and supplied those USD to BFL..... 
@_date: 2013-08-18 00:50:58
that wouldn't be a bad thing, especially if the 65's are going to be outdated shortly.  The question for buyers will be, "is it worth the wait"  If I could have 1.5 TH now, vs maybe having 6 for the same price, maybe in a few months, what makes the most sense.

If you manage the funds correctly, it should be a big risk dealing with the cash yourself.  I have one on order for Canada.  If you're dealing with 10's of 1000's, ya it might be a good idea to get a company to do it.  I think you've got a bigger problem if you have 10k in the machine itself.  The key is more regular emptying. 
If you empty it every 1000 or 2000 or so, it's probably not as much as the register in the store it's located at.

I just have a certain level of skepticism with everything i read.  There's lots of fake reports going on.  
I guess it just doesn't seem like a letter a bank would write.  Like i said, 
1) That address doesn't show up on google maps (it may be too new)
2) The address doesn't match any locations on their website
3) the letter isn't signed by anyone or from anyone. (your name is covered by a piece of paper, but the branch manager's isn't even there)
4) The wording gives no explanation or reasoning and is not well written.
It could well be real, but it doesn't pass my smell test
why someone would post a fake letter, I don't know...? but it wouldn't be the first time people have scammed others and it won't be the last.

i wouldn't trust the % rate as an indicator.  Difficulty is based on the hash rate.  In the past month, the hashrate has doubled, most likely due to production by one company (not necessarily but probable).  So, the last increase was 100%, 400TH/200Th, If that production were to remain constant, then the next one would only be 50%, 600/400.  so unless production were to follow the same shape, or another company were to mass produce this month, you would not expect the same huge jump in network hash rate.  
@_date: 2013-08-18 13:42:23
as part of the rules for preorders, i think from ftc maybe.... Not 100% sure, pre order money cannot be used fir development of the product. So when they ship a unit, the funds for that unit are released to the company.  BflJosh has mentioned this. 
no good investor will blindly put up money for a product that may or may not sell... Hence the pre orders for the products. The pre orders satisfy the investors demand that there is. Market and that their investment is relatively safe

the only way it runs out is if you don't have enough cash in your exchange account.  Basically, you fund your exchange account in Fiat.  Upon a sale, it converts it to btc, take it out of your reserves and you get cash in the machine.  You could also put in your own btc to sell. 
the robo coin does transactions both ways, but takes a hefty percentage on each transaction as well as costing a lot up front.
