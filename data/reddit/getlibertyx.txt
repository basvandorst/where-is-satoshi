yup! check out locations at 
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:39:44
Taken care of :)
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:36:21
for now. we are preparing for future growth opportunities though and it will largely be based on demand. where are you hailing from?
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:31:23
Currently we offer 4 PINs representing the most commonly requested denominations. We wanted to get the product out to the community as soon as we could so certain features like buying other denominations are not available yet. It's on the development pipeline. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:06:07
Once you click a location on the store locator it's listed in the step by step directions. We are working to make "QPay" more front and center since it would solve a lot of the in-store issues. Thanks for the feedback. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 16:56:04
libertyx here. we have over 70 locations in PA. go to our [site]( and check out the locations!
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:45:39
hey, i think we resolved your issue? just wanted to tie up all loose ends on reddit :)
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:30:59
hi there. we are currently not charging any fees/spread to reward early customers. the trailblazer $5 in BTC is a separate transaction. the customer would have received an additional ~0.014 in BTC separately.
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:38:07
should work now  :)
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:26:31
Not yet...
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:13:53
Global Cellular @ 825 Veterans Highway 8 in Bristol, PA 19007 is the closet store to you (~71 mi). We hope to launch in NJ in the future to make it much more (an hour) convenient for you.
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:13:34
You will need to provide basic driver’s license information for ID verification. We respect privacy as much as we can while still being fully compliant. No first born required at this time.  Maybe for higher limits later on ;)
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:03:41
We’re fully compliant after investing a lot of resources over the last year. We’re working hard to expand to the remaining states.
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:13:52
$1K/day. some stores may have their own credit limits where you may not be able to purchase the whole $1K. no-fees (0%) currently to reward early adopters and help build out this new cash channel.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:33:11
PA or DE probably are closest for you. If you give me your ZIP, I can tell you the closest location. We are working expanding to NJ/NY (huge markets) as well. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:46:45
hey, you're not alone! we're working on that very feature and should have it available later this evening. thanks for your patience.
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:47:00
which location did you have an issue with? please email us at support and we'll make this right. thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:43:53
appreciate you testing out the site and feedback. we should have an update to the site in a few hours that will make a lot of this a lot cleaner and intuitive (for both desktop and mobile). i'll update the first post to let you know when that happens. thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:24:36
$1.00 thanks for the catch!
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:27:08
yes, at any of the trailblazer locations (orange pins on the map, highlighted in the list below) here: 
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:19:05
amen! trying to practice what we preach.
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:43:17
is that a request? :) we are prioritizing next expansion opportunities based on user feedback. that's one more vote for europe!
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:25:17
As far as hurdles we’ve overcome, this one is on the funnier side. That said, we completely understand the seriousness / urgency to this one as well. Comment edited above.
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:42:13
our new store locator is here: should work now  no login required :)
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:17:27
hey we are available in FL for buying bitcoin! were you not able to see store locations near you at libertyx.com/locations? 
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:16:19
it lists the nearest stores within a 20 mi radius. gelocation is used by default. try entering other zip codes if you want to find stores elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:30:05
That is hilarious. News to us.
Edit: We’re working to fix this now.
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:07:46
thanks for catching that. will fix it ASAP. the other signup links should work.
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:39:52
for now. we are preparing for future growth opportunities though and it will largely be based on demand. where are you hailing from?
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:31:27
it's on our list of to-do's :) 
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:45:05
actually underbanked/unbanked have a higher smartphone penetration than fully banked individuals. however they can't generally buy things online w/o a credit card. with libertyX, they can now buy bitcoin using cash at a store nearby to purchase goods online!
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:41:35
also new store locator here so you can look at other nearby locations as well: should work now 
@_date: 2014-12-06 06:01:33

yup. check out the new store locator: 
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:33:52
hey there. we've had many people already buy bitcoin since we launched our new 2,500 store network last week. try it out and let us know your thoughts :) we have support online, via phone and email and are happy to walk you through the process.
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:06:18
hey, libertyx here. sorry to hear about the verification issue. did you recently move? if so, some users have had luck using their previous address. we compare it with public database information so sometimes it takes time for information to propagate. 
RE: state ID, that was just a quick way of summarizing the info that we needed to verify a user. the information you entered is all that we need to verify you.
RE: localbitcoins comparison, the stores have consistent business hours that a lot of people prefer to having to setup an in-person meeting with a stranger. also, we are not charging fees currently to reward our early customers for trying the service out (currently our price is ~bitstamp). long term, we do plan to be the lowest cost cash option for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:26:04
Right now we’re selling at 0% (below cost). We wanted to reward our earliest users that help us work out any kinks. Long-term, we may raise prices a little to survive, but still aim to be the cheapest cash option.
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:36:17
nope. just a bunch of text fields!
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:19:28
We're still a few friends / bitcoin enthusiasts bootstrapping here. We need support from the community to get the word out, so thank you! $1.00
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:38:48
should work now  :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:59:36
No need to apologize for grilling us. Feedback is very much welcomed. What we have learned on this thread has been very valuable, and we are incorporating much of it into our service as we speak.
We are pro-privacy. We work hard everyday to make our product increasingly aligned with our values and our customers’ interests, all while balancing the often competing demands from banks and regulators. As you can see in the current signup process, we require less information than online exchanges, and information is only reported if it is specifically requested in a subpoena (which has not happened). Again, if you buy bitcoin over the counter and send it to your address, your bitcoin is your property and you have complete control. We bought our first bitcoin on localbitcoins and love that service, but LibertyX is way faster, cheaper, and safer. Stay tuned, as our service is improving rapidly with help from feedback like yours!
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:23:19
We're pulling that up to the front page and making it searchable by city instead of just zip. Hope to have it up soon. In the meantime, please use [this]( to check other zips. If we don't have a location near you, but you can think of some good spots, please let us know via support
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:10:49
we're there now!
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:42:25
thanks, just submitted a ticket request!
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:25:10
Currently yes, but we are working on moving the store locator to the front page before signing up. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:21:06
we started off with America's first bitcoin ATM in boston (as libertyteller.com) and now have expanded nationwide with "virtual" ATMs. we think word of mouth and a solid user experience go much farther than splashy marketing. we haven't spent money on ads yet and are really excited to offer this solution to the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:08:47
we're working on it! we've spoken to many of the outlets and provided the dealers with background/instructional information as well. all it takes is a few customers coming through in the beginning and asking for LibertyX to get them into the flow.
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:11:19
hey, all stores were sent notice of the partnership and new libertyx product but some of the employees may not have been told this by their boss and still haven't done a libertyx transaction (hence their response). that will change with time and a reason we are offering the $5 trailblazer incentive for being the first at a store. 
if you ask to buy a QPay PIN and tell them they do have it already in their system they will find it 9 times out of 10. we are working on direction integration so this experience will be smoother in the future. we just wanted to get the product out since there is a real dearth of cash buying bitcoin options today!
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:23:42
$1.00 good feedback. thanks for digging in and testing out the site rigorously. we're working on resolving these as we speak.
@_date: 2014-12-17 06:36:34
hey, very sorry to hear this. what state are you in? please email us at support and we'll fix this ASAP. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:16:09
hey there, we are live now at 2,500 stores across the country. we had some hiccups with the store locator when we first launched but should be ready to handle the traffic/load now :) libertyx.com/locations
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:51:47
you can use the location search to find a store near you or enter the zip code of interest.
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:14:12
sounds interesting! email us at support and let's continue the conversation.
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:17:26
we have our phone # on site that directly connects to us and online chat available to answer any questions about the process. 617 444 9980, support and onsite chat for the lazy!
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:26:49
hey, thanks for the feedback. the stores are a mixture of convenience, mobile phone, electronic and pharmacy stores that are part of the QPay network. they tend to be reflective of the neighborhoods the stores are located in. 
we continue to add stores all the time. if you have any suggestions on specific stores you would like to see near you, please email us suggestions at stores for what it's worth, we went to all the boston locations ourselves to try them out. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:35:30
it's on our expansion list :) so many great market opportunities. where are you located in canada?
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:11:59
$1.00 really appreciate the feedback and support! We've gotten a lot of helpful advice from the bitcoin community over the past few hours since we've launched, and are incorporating it into the service as we speak.
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:44:08
main benefit is getting bitcoin easily/"instantly". 
we operate 4 bitcoin ATMs in Boston and now have 2,500 virtual ATMs (cashiers) you can buy bitcoin from (libertyx.com/locations). there is a basic ID verification required in order to set up a libertyx account (takes 1-2 mins) but once that is done you can have bitcoin in your wallet as soon as you go the the ATM/retail store.
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:53:29
just heard back from them and we have been removed from their blacklist. hopefully all you folks at work can now buy bitcoin again :)
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:45:29
$1.00 thanks for the feedback. we're about to roll out a new store locator on the homepage.
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:38:34
yup, almost there! last step is verifying address/DOB and then you can begin redeeming PIN codes. bizzare on the missed txt msg confirmation. it usually takes only a few secs. if you email us at support i can look into that for you.
@_date: 2014-12-06 18:58:16
tl;dr: Once you have your bitcoin, you are free to do with it as you wish. We agree with your sentiment, but also believe we can do more for bitcoin by not getting shut down.
More detail: 
For bitcoin to thrive, we need bridges that move value from the centralized legacy system to the internet of value that we are all working hard to create. Bridges that touch the legacy system must unfortunately deal with a lot of complex regulations, particularly in the U.S. These regs started out with good intentions (consumer protection), but now often do more to protect incumbents (e.g., Western Union) and reduce innovation (we’ve spent as much time and resources on the law as our product). We would like nothing more than to get rid of all of it, but we are just a few bitcoin enthusiasts, and hiring a huge army of lobbyists is not something we can afford.
The U.S. government decides who we cannot do business with. You may find more detail [here] ( A “person” is someone that has a public record. As far as compliance demands that governments impose, pinging lists is a relatively startup-friendly compromise, as it is cheaply and easily done with code.
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:42:35
should work now  thanks for your patience.
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:42:08
sure. it's to prove you are a real person and not on any restricted lists.
@_date: 2014-12-04 03:47:53
happy to chat in more detail, shoot us an email - support
we're working on streamlining the store partner signup process and will post more to the site as soon as it's ready
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:12:00
First, we want to assure you that your credits will not get “stuck.” The way it works is as follows: sign up, buy a pin, enter pin and bitcoin address, click redeem and get bitcoin. You can only buy pins in supported regions that are listed on the locations page.
The notice you see above is for a separate service (no-volatility service) that we have been piloting on a limited basis. This is not available in most states. We wanted to let people know where we are headed, but understand that it still could be a little confusing the way it is currently shown. We will work to make that more clear!
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:22:12
you may have clicked the "send" button on the menu bar on the left of the screen? we are currently piloting certain services (hybrid wallet) that are not available in certain states. however for buying and redeeming bitcoin PIN's (the locations tab) you should be good to go!
@_date: 2014-12-04 03:28:46
Right now we’re selling at 0% (below cost). We wanted to reward our earliest users that help us work out any kinks. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:18:16
we're offering $5 in BTC for the first person to buy bitcoin in each store. it's part of our trailblazer promotion and more details are provided when you click on an eligible location.
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:57:13
updated store search so you do not need to login.  and also linked at the top of the main page. enter your ZIP/city and you should now see the stores nearby.
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:59:20
feedback like yours helps us determine where to expand next :) happy to chat in more detail, shoot us an email - support
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:18:48
awesome to hear. we wanted to thank the broader community for all the help and feedback you’ve provided since launching a week ago. we have made a bunch of improvements to the store locator (no log-in required to search locations) and purchase process (we have an explainer video and 3 step directions on the main page). 
we’ve also launched a the trailblazer program (the $5 free BTC you received) to reward the first customer in each of our 2,500 stores. if a store is still eligible you should see a notification on the store location (libertyx.com/locations).
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:13:40
Selling at 0% right now (below cost). We want to reward early users that help us iterate on the product!
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:04:01
looks like i'm a little late to the game but here to answer any questions you have!
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:27:15
yup. you got it.
1. Find a store nearby (libertyx.com/locations) 
2. Pay cash and receive a LibertyX PIN receipt
3. Go to LibertyX.com/redeem and enter the PIN code and the address you want the bitcoin sent to. You do have to login to your account and perform a one-time ID verification (essentially driver's license information) to make sure you are a real person for this last step.
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:35:34
Tweaking the location search function as we speak. Learning a lot on launch day :) . We appreciate the support of bitcoin community members like you very much! $1
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:03:03
hey everyone. chris and kyle from libertyx here. we just launched a national network of 2,500 stores where you can buy bitcoin from the cashier. check out libertyx.com for the location nearest you. would love to hear about your experience and any feedback you have for us. 
Edit 2: store locator is now live w/o login:  and at the top of the navbar on the home page. just enter a city/ZIP and see the locations nearby. working away at the other issues. thanks for your patience!
Edit 1: Thank you all for the feedback! We are moving the store locator to the front page, fixing a couple UX bugs, and incorporating other feedback as well.
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:42:40
$1K per day and we are working to increase it! rest assured it's on our roadmap :) appreciate your patience.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:42:19
that means we were unable to verify your identity given the information provided. if may be that you entered an address that was too new (can try an older address) or upload an ID. once that is done we generally can complete the sign up process within minutes. thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:25:24
really appreciate the feedback. we've come a long way in the past 9 months but there still is plenty of work to be done. one specific thing we're working on is bringing the store locator to the front page (to fix your exact issue of seeing what stores are nearby). we hope to have that complete tonight. thanks for taking the site for a spin $1
@_date: 2015-01-22 03:02:18
we currently offer 4 PINs: $50, $100, $200, $300. working to add variable load amounts as well but wanted to get a product out as soon as possible :) you could buy a 50 and a 200 to get $250
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:03:55
Yup. We currently aren't charging fees so it's basically the Bitstamp/Bitfinex price when you redeem the PIN. The price is real-time and shown on the screen.
If you purchase a PIN at a previously new store (eligible stores listed as trailblazer reward on-site) you get an extra $5 in BTC sent to your address.
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:21:17
we're continuously working to prune locations that may have migrated off the system. please continue to report them. we offer trailblazer rewards for these efforts as well! support thanks for all your help and appreciate your patience.
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:23:38
try  does that work? we should have an updated store locator available on the main page later tonight. thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:00:18
cash only. if you are the first customer to try a store out, you may need to 1) ask to buy a QPay PIN 2) then tell them LibertyX as the merchant and let them know it is already in the drop down list. once 1 person has bought and they begin to become familiar with the libertyx name it is a lot quicker. our plan with the trailblazer program was to give $5 to people who helped us smooth out the process at locations. thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:35:44
Yes, that store should be listed at libertyx.com/locations. If you don't see it please let us know at support
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:32:26
love the support. we want to reward early supporters who help us build out this new network. 
here is map of the states we are currently live in: 
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:31:36
great to hear from you guys. keep the feedback coming. we have been busy in the labs trying out new features. one thing we had entertained was also providing a wallet. we did a deep dive and found that there were people focusing on wallet functionality and security full-time (bitgo, mycelium, hive, blockchain) that could do a much better job than us so we have decided to focus solely on one thing: simplifying the buying bitcoin process. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:39:10
you can trailblaze as many stores that remain eligible. if you want to be our 1K store trailblazer man/woman, we're more than happy to pay the $5k :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:37:30
it of course varies real-time but as of now (feb 8 20:35 est) we @ 224.42 are currently are lower than coinbase (226.1, need to factor in the 1% fee or use their correct pricing API), and higher than bitstamp/bitfinex (though if you factor in the wire fees and time (3-4 days for int'l wire), may be much cheaper as well).
