5 years from now.

Hmmm looks like I'll be buying a lens from you once the next bubble comes around

I got sick of the program as it took forever to download the chain and would often quit when trying to do so. 
Multibit is super lightweight and awesome. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:03:20
Uh wut
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:53:55
Same. Shame it went down after the IPO
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:09:47
Same. That's why we invested!
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:53:33
As usual
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:19:59
Yeah but that means bitcoin will have a lower value than it has today. Moon or 0.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:25:51
Cool, about to buy a Mini! 
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:02:30
Bigger blocks
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:48:10
You forget lots of people don't care what's under the hood, as long as it works. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:12:19
Together we all have power man
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:20:26
lol wut? you know there's a planned hardfork in november for that right?
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:21:35
I think Coinbase and Gemini both do USD to etherum
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:33:20
So this doesn't mean anything and is pure fallacy?
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:52:05
Anyone know what happened during the spike January '14?
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:58:48
It will pullback.
Nobody knows when.
@_date: 2016-02-07 23:59:36
Yea haha. "Paypal is new money"
Uh wut?
Is my jacket worth 32 Paypals?
@_date: 2016-02-08 06:03:36
Can you use half a PayPal? 
@_date: 2015-09-29 13:00:58
Yes, I see that wallet now. I will definitely look into that. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:52:06
Hi, thank you for you help.
Actually the Multibit folder randomly showed up in the exact same spot I have been looking. It doesn't make any sense to me, but all my coins are there so whatever!
@_date: 2015-11-14 06:58:38
Damn I am jacked. sold some at 480, 650, 750, and 900. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 02:40:10
They reversed all the trades
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:40:25
No :(
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:05:36
Bitcoin going up on a Tuesday
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:27:36
How long does it take to get confirmed?
@_date: 2015-11-14 09:05:33
no, I wish haha. Just had them up in case of bubble so I could take profit if I couldn't make it to a computer in time. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 19:24:33
Yep that's how capitalism works
@_date: 2015-10-22 02:11:13
yea, really stupid.
reminds me of this:

Followed by an awesome, firey reentry back into Earth's atmosphere
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:28:27
A beer is worth exactly $3.64? Interesting.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:23:39
Pretty sure the bars represent the change in the amount of orders at that price. Still figuring out exactly how they work though.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:17:48
WALLS ARE MEANT TO BE BROKEN
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:06:28
Yeah, they just dropped Dwolla, and their only other USD deposit is through mailing checks or money orders in.
As the other guy said, they will be offering deposits through ACH from your bank account on November 20th. I would assume that will move the price closer to the bigger guys. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:00:07
Think of Mt. Gox and CampBX. Those distinguish themselves from the other exchanges in part due to not sounding like all the other ones. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:36:29
There are many fake trading websites out there. BTC isn't so popular that there is "fake" markets out there. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:27:39
Damn, too late
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:20:09
Perhaps it's the START of one?
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:47:10
mhmmm so flat.
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:54:42
/end sarcasm
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:20:36
Yeah, it would be nice to have a stable price. But, then I couldn't live out my day trading dreams like I am right now.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:59:35
So is it safe to say that I think we're starting another Bitcoin bubble? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:17:10
Virox. You can buy up to $65 USD worth, then convert it to Second Life money, which can then be converted into BTC. Yeah, there will be some fees, but that's the best way I've found.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:32:51
My guess is $40 at the lowest. There's some big walls at those numbers, but those can always be broken through.
Posting this now so if I'm right I can feel good about myself. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:03:48
Good detective work
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:49:42
Yeah I don't get the reddit wallets either. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:41:58
Virwox can buy BTC using PayPal. You have to buy SLL (second life dollars or something) then convert those into BTC. May run you a little more expensive, but if you're desperate why not.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:14:18
The large green wall on the second graph.
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:12:33
I actually downloaded it again, as I bought a stock. Could you possibly make the refresh and setting buttons a bit bigger? My fingers are too big :(
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:39:21
Hope you haven't cashed out yet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:19:43
It's always a good time to buy.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:18:29
^^just ^^kidding
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:20:30
If that isn't working, try selling low and buying high.
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:33:17
Uh. Link a bank account to coinbase? That's what I find easiest. You can also mail money orders (the ones you can get at post offices)  to sites like CampBX. That website also accepts checks If you mail it to them. Credit cards aren't really accepted yet because most ways of using cards online are easily refundable and well, bitcoins are not. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:58:25
Not with Charter...
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:42:17
A ha. So this thread is the reason the price has skyrocketed. I've been buying and selling this share as it usually fluctuates pretty reliably, and then it shot up to almost 1.5BTC and I'm stuck without a stock. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:25:04
Well I got into the market at $180 (of course) so I lost about 50% after the bubble, which was not much money-wise. But I've probably gained half of it back, so not too shabby for some simple day-trading
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:21:57
The problem with OS is that there isn't much compatible software for overclocking. That's why people run bootcamp. Usually people with MacBooks don't have them for the specs. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:16:37
Media attention always drives up the price. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 05:30:35
I noticed and thought it was because of me haha. Way better layout than lsst one?
@_date: 2013-05-07 16:32:42
ITunes gift cards or other gift cards to places that don't accept BTC yet. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:39:08
My bad. I meant "real" money fake trading websites. Bitcoins are popular enough for there to be models out there to trade them without actually having them. Practice day trading real stocks.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:16:15
Perhaps we haven't reached that speed yet? Anyways, never take financial advice from the internet.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:02:00
Also, don't overclock Macbooks. They don't have proper cooling systems.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:30:41
Just gotta set some orders and stick to 'em. Don't do trades that will lose ya money.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:32:04
Yep. The "crash" will be a price like $200
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:39:40
Still the downfall of the bubble.
pop ^pop ^^pop ^^^pop ^^^^pop 
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:01:28
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:37:38
Why would I click on that? That's totally a virus.
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:45:16
Any info on the Mac version?
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:11:50
That's one hell of a wall at 50. Can it break through is the question tonight, Cotton.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:16:46
Not completely positive, but I believe that could have been the past graphs. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:15:55
It would seem to me they are just trend lines. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:13:13
Buying bitcoin. And having my roommates buy bitcoin. And encouraging my brother's startup to accept bitcoin. 
Edit: bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:48:07
You want to help people who use your money because you rely on them for value. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:22:11
Nope, 50 BTC is nothing in the market (Mt. Gox at least). There are orders of 50 going through almost every other second.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:58:42
That is correct. If you don't buy, you'll be poor in 10 years. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:47:46
This is trippy
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:33:16
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:35:39
Looks cool. This may be not the type of app I thought it was, but is there no Mt. Gox?
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:58:16
Don't worry everybody. He's a Nigerian Prince
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:56:09
Exactly. I'd like to be the one capitalizing on it
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:21:00
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:15:15
Don't take financial advice from the internet.
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:11:57
So is this an AMA?
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:50:57
Ah, makes sense. Good looking widget, nonetheless. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:30:20
Thank god, the previous depth table was really bad. This is awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:29:16
Man this Subway is gonna pave the path for Subway BTC usage.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:30:47
Same boat, but I'm in for the long run. Gonna pick some more up when this thing bottoms out and hold on for the ride.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:26:45


What information could this possibly be? They would be able to see past transactions on the same wallet that they used to purchase whatever it was. Is this a disadvantage of Bitcoin? Would it be able to be circumvented by proper services?
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:56:47
At least
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:26:47
Oh goodness, this will be your only time sharing this information?
Man, this is some heavy stuff.
@_date: 2013-05-08 04:53:58
But what's their favorite color? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:29:55
How adorable
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:16:46
Haha thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:15:00
The ask orders keep pounding away at the wall, will their hammers be enough to take the wall down? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:32:30
This. Actually makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2013-05-09 06:32:55
lol Yeah, I'll just wait for this "bubble" to pop to pick it back up. It'll come back down to 1.3 or a bit lower soon
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:18:10
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:45:58
Yeah, I usually close it when I'm not using it, even though I have a high end laptop. It'll use up a decent amount of CPU and RAM just chillin' in the background.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:44:56
Interesting. I'm just along for the ride (and hopefully to be able to score a profit so I can buy more bitcoin). 
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:42:01
I believe the current price is rising too fast to just be reaching it's natural price. It's rising far faster than the mean has been. And with the media attention it is starting to get, I believe there will be a bubble (I'm gonna say around a $600 peak, just for fun), but post bubble crash will still be around $200, where it will continue its slow ascent to the moon.
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:54:02
Buy, and then sell, and then buy again blindly. 
^^This ^^might ^^actually ^^work
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:27:26
Damn :/ I was going to arbitrage as soon as I could. CampBX is always way lower than the other exchanges. After this starts working it will be right in the middle of it all
@_date: 2013-08-31 15:18:52
Can't, being tortured for my wallet password. Brb
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:17:21
Yeah, this one will fall eventually, it's just a matter of when exactly. It's been in the 50s for a while compared to other numbers.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:26:23
This will continue to rise exponentially until it is used as our main and only currency. That is why I am bullish as this is what really drives the value of BTC for many, many, people.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:11:25
Virox can do it
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:09:24
It's always a good time to buy.
