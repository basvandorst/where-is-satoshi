If on computer, go to 
Click "Depth chart" at the top right, just left of "Trade history"
Click the - button to zoom out a little, the red side is the sell offers available, if you put your mouse over it it will say how many coins are available at which price, for example if you mouse over where the price would be 20k USD you can see that there is a steep "wall" just where it hits 20k, at 19.993USD there are 2.200 coins available, at 20.003USD there is 2.780, a "wall" of about 580 coins.

How easy or hard it is depends if people are buying and if those that listed the sell offers keep their offers there once the market gets there, if they remove their offers before they are met they disappear without having to be bought.
Also just to be clear, the 2.200 coins will be bought first, then the 520coin wall at 20.000USD starts, those 2.200 coins include all coins listed between current price and 19.993USD

Sure, might work, easier if you have a lot of money to spend. 
(first 100 in the initial investment)
USD-------------BTC buying at 15k--USD after 20k SELL
So after 14 iterations youre up to 5612 USD, a respectable 5512 profit.
Heres another one starting at 19300usd and with only 5 jumps
USD start ----.---15k BUY---------20k SELL
About 62kUSD profit.
One problem is that there are not many crashes in this range, mostly you will have crashes around 1.2k which doesnt net you nearly as much money (i made a similar one where it crashed from 20.000 to 18.300 14 times in a row) and you hit them perfectly and with an initial investment of 100USD that would net you 346 USD after 14 dips,  with a 246USD profit, not much to celebrate. Day trading is super hard and exhausting, what if there are no more big dips, or no bigger dips at all? There was one from 19,5k (where very very few got to sell) down to 13,5k (Where very few people got to buy, it was up to 14400 shortly after. 
Most of the dips you will be temped to buy in will be around 500usd to 1,5k, and with a 100usd initial investment that gives only 205usd after 14 of these in the end (100 usd profit).
If you have the patience and mental fortitude to do it, try with a smaller amound like 100 usd and see how it goes, maybe its fun, for me it was stressful and I really felt like my money was better spent just holding as I didnt have the patience to wait for days to find a bit of a bubble, and then try to time it right, only to have very low return.
Conclution: Might be worth if youre playing with much money, and thinks its fun (and also doenst hurt you economically if you fuck it up)
TL:DR not worth it for 99% of people

Pasting my old answer from a couple of days ago, so the figures probbably dont match anymore.

Which exchange are you using? 
When I was looking into buying BTC from blockchain.info (bank transfer with direct conversion into BTC) it said that the rates are subject to change and the rate at the time they process your payment will be used (so if the price on BTC goes up or down during this time they would use that rate).
On the other exchanges I'm not sure how they handle it, I started using ones that allowed me to do a bank transfer into a EURO wallet on their site and once the money was transfered decide myself if I wanted to buy Cryptocoins at the current price using their markets.
Some times I have used a VISA/MasterCard to buy crypto, if you do that it will give you the rate they show when you make the transaction, this is however more expensive because of creditcard fees (in my case the price increase during the 3-5 days the bank transfer would have taken have been well worth it every time except for 1 where it took bitcoin about a week to recover to where I bought)

Any exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:54:42
Ping, heres the dip :D
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:45:31
Yeah no wonder you see this is a pyramid scheme if you believe the only reason bitcoin exists is to make money off the rising price. You realize the fees and transaction times werent like this as recent as 6 months ago?
Darknet markets proved and continue to prove that cryptos have real use, illegal or otherwise.

Its only a mistake until it breaks 19,800 again :)
I bought some at 14,800(euro) on december 8, which dipped down to 11,500 right after, bought some more at 12,000. Today the dip was down to my "mistake" level of december 8 and I was happy to pick up some more at that price.

Yes, its showing the total amount of bitcoins that are up for sale from the current lowest sell offer to the point where youre looking, as well as how much money it would cost to buy all of those bitcoins.
Yes there is a 600 BTC wall at 19000, but probably many people put their sell offers at 19000 not just 1 person, so they stack together.

Im not sure where you could see the historical data, but there are several posts on this subreddit where you can see some walls getting eaten, like this one from a few days ago 
91 million is a lot but as you can see on gdax the 24h volume is above 30k btc, or 526 million usd(at current price). Included in that 24h volume is a lot of day traders buying and selling though so that influences the volume but not really the price.
During the insane run on december 7/8 the 24h volume was above 90k if i remember correctly, so the walls look big but thats just because we're normal humans who dont buy 200 btc, 3 times in a row like someone did in the video i linked :)

Haha looking through all my old transactions, June 2015 I bought and sent away 0.78 BTC, July 2015 I bought and sent away 1.4 BTC, I tallied up all my pre HODL bitcoins (of which I have none left) and they're totalling something like 80K USD today.
Nothing to do about that now thought, atleast I'm up a fair amount after I started holding instead of spending :)

Eventually, yes. People will be buying every day items with crypto currency. 
The technology isnt quite there yet and adoption/awareness definitely isnt there yet, but once the technology is good enough and easy enough for people to use (think QR code pops up at checkout terminal when buying groceries that you scan with your wallet app on your phone -&gt; funds transfered -&gt; you get receipt. Or NFC from your phone so you dont even have to scan it, or something thats not even invented yet), eventually thats where we're heading.
It might not be bitcoin (but who knows with 1-20 years more development?), but definitely some of them will be used in this manner.
We are in the baby stage of cryptos, new uses will be invented.
As I wrote in another reply in this thread, Darknet markets have used bitcoins as currency for a long time and I have bought bitcoins for physical money from a guy who had lost his wallet in a foreign (my) country so that he could have enough to keep afloat until he could get help from home, it already has uses other than investments.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:16:34
Haha man, I wish I knew, it might dip again when BCH trading resumes on GDAX I guess but other than that I have no idea (and not basing that on anything other than that the markets went crazy when BCH was announced on coinbase). 
Im just buying a small amount after every paycheck now to hold for a long time, so current price doesnt matter too much for me even if its always nice to buy low :)

Darknet markets have used bitcoin like real money for years.
A guy who was travelling wrote on my hometowns subreddit that he had lost his wallet and was wondering if someone was willing to meet up and buy some bitcoins for local currency so that he wouldnt be all out of money until he could get help from home (think someone in his family was sending him money or a creditcard in the mail), I met up with him and bought 2500SEK worth of bitcoins.
With the current fees and transaction times im sure the darknet markets are trying to switch over to other cryptos, and the 2nd example wouldnt really be possible.
When transaction fees and transaction times goes down it will be viable as currency for smaller amounts once again, question is if something else will swoop in before that happens.
For now, BTC is just for holding.

Transfer them (Free and instantly) to your account on gdax (same login as coinbase, i think...) from there you can sell them on the exchange, get your money instantly and rebuy if you want to. You can also transfer it back from gdax to coinbase instantly and for free whenever you want
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:41:52
Give it 30min and itll probbably be back, gdax is a freaking bouncy castle right now
edit after 30mins: oops 14500 :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:32:23
Yeah fucking love it, bought at 12200 euro 10 days ago, bought at 14790 today, good days

In 3,5hours I think
