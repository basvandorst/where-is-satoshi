Mmmm, why does no one think about an intelligence apparatus reaching this "barrier"?
For those agencies it would not be a big problem to reach 51% or would it?
What if the CIA, NSA, HS whatever would spend 10 Mio $/€ for cloud computing/FPGAs/new data center to reach 80%? Would it be possible for them to shut down the whole Bitcoin project?

Yes, the technology is there... Google could stop using banks and stock exchange ;). Imagine this kind of thing would happen, Bitcoin technology used as stock exchange, theirfor as money.

I like this post because it shows me how the Bitcoin community does work and will work in the future.
Someone sees a problem within the system and posts it to start a discussion. Now the community works on solutions.

Pyramid scheme. Get that fact, its nothing else or more than that. Get enough money from it as long as you can convince other people of the worthfullness of your coins.
This does not make the whole Bitcoin idea, code and technology any bad. Maybe we will see some day a lot of bitcoin forks, like GERcoin from Germany, Applecoin, Gcoin, what ever. You can even have shares of a company bound to a coin currency+their own network like this. Imagine Gcoins as a share on Google.
Future will tell, but fact is: Bitcoin=Pyramid scheme.

1) The upper part of the pyramid has 6 million Bitcoins. As long as they can convince the lower part of the pyramid that Bitcoins are worth something, they win.
2) They and the lower people have to find more and more other people who think that Bitcoins are worth something. Remeber when Bitcoins crashed down to $0.01?
