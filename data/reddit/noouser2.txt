Look, a currency is not created by Agreeing. People will not keep their word.
So something of Real Value must be injected. For example if I trade with Rolex watches, and I say: "Kiss XYZ and I'll pay you 2 rolexes," then if the person says: "LOL I don't accept your currency. I know I had agreed, but I'm breaking my word!"
Then the other guy will say: "Fine well screw you, I still find value in these 2 rolexes."

It seems that bitcoin enthusiasts are entering a period of dire poverty, with no light at the end of the tunnel.
If you honestly add up your earnings since December 1, your paycheck for this month is negative.
In other words, if a glass of tap water was free, you couldn't afford it
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:07:15
Yes but those dollars are redeemable for tax payment.
In other words if you owe $3000 to the government, and you have $0 in the bank account, and then someone transfers $3000, that is not "whatever, same." There is a big difference between east and west, as the arabs say. 
Bitcoin is like a supposed agreement, but anyone could break it. I would actually draw a serious comparison to the following: Prison economy.
In prison, real money is Cigarettes, and the equivalent of crypto money would be "reciting the alphabet."
There's a social agreement that whoever recites the alphabet correctly 2 times, he can have his cell cleaned by others.
Well, that would never work, because why would "verification of some data" be beneficial to the seller of goods and services.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:14:41
That is why it's important to have Floors and Cushions.
For example if I owned a Gold Certificate, and let's say one ounce was $1200.
Then I wouldn't really be worried that the Certificate falls to $1 because gold price of $1200 is Cushioning me.
That is why it's so Utterly Catastrophic and Life-Crushing, that bitcoin in fact has no floor.

Imagine you had the following 2 items in front of you

- nothing (bitcoin)

Imagine you heard someone else, propose this same thing, i.e. just have a bunch of words function as money.
"I want to buy your house. And thus I will recite the alphabet 4 times without error. That is my payment."
Wouldn't you recognize that to be just as absurd as bitcoin.
Why does it matter if all characters are verified, when the seller still receives absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:35:42
Basically it's absurd to just write something, and call it coin.
Such as the alphabet: ABCDE and so on, is that now a currency?

Let me try again.
If you have a house, then its price falls to $0, you are still kinda happy to at least own the physical house. 
If you have a stock that has earnings/dividend, if its price falls to $0, you still get dividends (e.g. $500) periodically.
So these are things that if they fall to $0 extrinstically (meaning on the market), they still bring some benefit to the owner. 
But what about cryptos. If the price falls to $0............ The owner can just angrily burn his coins, for they bring no enjoyment.

What if some subway lunatic has a "fantasy that no government can take away from him."
That obviously wouldn't be enough to make his fantasy worth $1,000,000.
So my theory is that Everyone's goal is to ultimately sell bitcoin, which means no one wants it.
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:55:07
Stocks are judged through Earnings, but real estate is valued though Rent.

You have to understand that Percentage Calculation applies to every amount.
So that means a $3200 bitcoin can still drop an additional 85%.
And whatever is left of that, can drop another 85% from there.
Someone told me a rumor that $00.01 was the minimum price (i.e. it's technically impossible to bid $00.009), but I'm not sure I believe that.
Even if that is true on the trading platforms, ten guys could come together to buy 1 bitcoin for $00.01 and that means the real-life price will be $00.001 per bitcoin.

Some of the most Soul Crushing comments are, when you buy at $17,600 and then it falls to $3400 and some kid writes: "Thinking about buying bitcoin, can you help me register an e-wallet."

What is the ultimate crypto fantasy scenario. Well, you wake up one day and find an e-wallet containing 8000000 somecoins (any large number of any cool cryptocoin).
You decide to quickly find a site that enables you to liquidate those holdings into U.S. dollar and then wire it to your phantom company in Grand Cayman.
So you check e-banking on your iphone, and it says your account now has $500,000,000,000.
Fine but this is pretty much normal life now. I mean you used cryptos just for that pivot from a smaller to a larger checking account,
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:20:53
Let's go forward now. If I say $3300 is too much, that would be like saying $20,000 is too much and it did come down 83%.
You said no, $20,000 is not too much. Well, now you say that about $3300 but an 83% drop from that level equals $561.

I really don't know what blockchain means, but I assume it's something stupid because the question is seldom asked, i.e. millions claim to know.

Think about it, if some investment is Likely to double.
Wouldn't smart people with Ph.D.s and professionals whomst manage billions say: "Hey, instead of getting Minus Zero percent when I put 1,000,000,000,000 in Swiss bonds, why not do 200% in bitcoin?"
The answer may shock you. It is because experts *don't* believe BTC is likely to double.
So how can you then say it will "definitely go up 30,000%."
And you don't know preferred stock from livestock, as the late Kirk Douglas used to say.

There's a lot of confusion in the general population as to why money has value.
For example many know that the dollar isn't backed by gold.
However, if they heard that $1,000,000 was paid to the Crips gang for their assassination, they would not say: "I'm not worried. Because no one will assassinate for a worthless currency like the dollar."
So there is a recognition that USD is valued, but at the same time a belief that the USD shouldn't be valuable.
