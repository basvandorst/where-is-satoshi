Get out of crypto asap If you can't stomach volatility or a loss.
@_date: 2019-07-25 10:06:42
What you describe makes no sense? Shorting is usually about borrowing the asset to sell it right away so that you can cover it later  when the price of the asset has fallen. Thats also the way it works at bitmex I believe. However bitmex only takes bitcoin as collateral
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:49:54
You can sell covered calls there. Wish they would be available in more places.

Why not demand some equity though? Even the guy who painted the walls for Facebook was able to get some so consultants should be able to get some as well?

How do you profit from a short when you go long on the asset?
@_date: 2019-07-13 07:50:44
You don't have to hold fiat money when you sell though. There are lots of things to invest in.

So you have worked at silicon valley startups for years and are not rich yet? Did you always pick the losers or have you spent a fortune on stupid stuff?
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:09:23
Could try to scam them by telling him you will start with a small amount and if it works you go all in. If they are greedy they will pay you the promised interest on the presumably small amount out of their pocket which you can take and run. It all depends on you convincing him that you are rich.

Biggest shit post in a while.
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:55:31
I didn't see anything but with the implied volatility Bitcoin has, no fool would sell a call option for such a tiny premium and any meaningful time frame.
@_date: 2019-03-11 18:12:28
Don't really think so. There were some pretty smart people among the early adopters that got in contact with Satoshi back in the days who never thought about it as a scam. If these hadn't recognized the potential right away we probably wouldn't be here. 
@_date: 2019-11-10 23:01:15
Learn programming instead. Much better return on your investment and time.

Totally on your side. The way some people in this sub try to force their agenda onto everyone in btc is extremely annoying. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 20:34:04
Where do I shill? I don't even have an account with them but when you're bombarded every day with these stupid posts it gets annoying. I mean we get it you don't like coinbase so don't use them and get over it.

What? Numbers have gone way up.
@_date: 2019-11-06 12:54:59
For me stocks are the most important asset besides crypto. But choosing the "right" ones is certainly not a simple task. If you agree with the notion that the world economy is growing in the long run go with a low cost etf on a broad world based index.

Do you even know what futures are? If the answer is no do some googling first.
@_date: 2019-03-09 00:06:59
Yes there is atleast to the extent of single coin failures/scams whatsoever. 
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:46:38
Get lost. That call option would never trade at 5$.
@_date: 2019-11-19 10:21:49
Try to understand it before you put more money in. Never invest into anything just because a friend/random guy tells you to. Also don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

Over the years I come to suspect that it's also heavily influenced by how you find out about it. I have noticed time and time again that if you try to sell the idea to somebody else they almost always push back and become super sceptical about it but when they stumble upon it themselves they are usually much more open towards it. 
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:55:49
It's not the retail traders who buy these. Also you can still make profits from negative yielding bonds.

Negative interest so what? It's uncharted territory no one knows what's going to happen not you or any doomsday prophet that you follow. Japan has had very low interest rates for 20 years now and guess what they are still doing well. Even if we get a global recession there are absolutely zero reasons to why that would end all economies and fiat currencies indefinitely.

No it wouldn't. You forget all the stupid predictions that never materialize. A few of them however eventually will be correct just by chance.

You can't even properly read my name, there is no "spirit" in there but no idea what that would have to do with taking credit for other peoples achievements. Also no need to hunt anyone down when you can just clarify it in the title of the post or the extra text field. And the evidence suggests that almost everyone that responded to your post actually thought you are the guy. He also did not find this post because you made him aware of it.
@_date: 2019-10-10 10:58:08
Hey man. Good that you found this post. Great work and keep it up! Do you work on crypto stuff professionally?
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:26:38
There is no way to prove that.

The money is not the main issue here. You posted this like it's your accomplishment quietly accepting all the kind words and credits given to the man. If the guy wasn't using reddit he would probably never see it. Just shows a lack of respect and unethical behavior from your part.
@_date: 2019-10-20 08:25:00
Your profile is funny. You have nothing else to do than telling people they made bad investments? How about getting a life, a job or using your supreme investment knowledge to generate a better return than BTC has ytd?

Wait so situation actually improved? What caused it ?
@_date: 2019-10-31 13:52:01
Amen brother.
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:58:42
Sounds like an absolute terrible deal. You take on difficulty, price, scam and political risk for a tiny profit margin. If there is any way out of the deal without loosing too much of the initial investment I'd take it.
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:28:36
Those aren't options just regular short/long positions on margin as far as I know.

Don't be afraid. Some technical discussions would be a welcome change from all these shit posts, doomsday talk and the agenda pushing.

@_date: 2019-12-28 22:54:03
It's not free at all. You either pay for it through taxes or by having private insurance. And what you get for it is far from being optimal. Insurers don't have to pay for a lot of treatments that are not deemed essential. You also may wait months for an appointment for specialized doctors where they will barely listen or do any tests and just present you with some random guess what you might have.
@_date: 2019-12-28 22:42:13
Are you really comparing yourself with a multinational corporation? The tax schemes also are a little bit more involved than just setting up some shop in a different country. 
However since you're german you may find the youtube channel "steuern mit Kopf" helpful.

Im by no means a tax expert but I dont see why you should be able to legally dodge taxes by simply opening an account somewhere else. I also agree that Germany isnt the greatest place to accumulate wealth. Maybe think about moving to Singapore or some similar place.

Well I can only speak of personal experiences and those of people I know but yes if you pay extra or have private insurance you are much more likely to receive helpful and timely treatment.
@_date: 2019-12-28 23:21:50
1.)Get the bitcoin address of the receiver.
2.)Buy the coins from a trustworthy exchange. Buy a little more than you want to send due to fees.
3.)Send the coins directly from said exchange to the receiver by copy pasting his address and typing in the amount you want to send(0.5 in your case). The fee calculation should be automated that you don't have to worry about it.
@_date: 2019-01-18 07:54:28
Was working on something similar some time ago. Rather than asking some api if a balance isn't zero you should get a dictionary of every public key ever used and run a check there. Should be much faster but I don't remember how much memory that required.

Which was the reasonable thing to do as Bitcoin back then was nothing like it's now. Chances are that if you were reckless enough to go all in back then you would be broke by now due to blowing profits on stupid shit or bad investments.
