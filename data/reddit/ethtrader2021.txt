I don’t care about this. It has nothing to do with my coins.

Yes, it does according to the law. He’s one of the most prolific drug dealers in the world, not to mention it’s strongly suggested he was selling CP, ads for murderers for hire, and criminal how to guides on his liberirtarian site.

Antifa is anti-fascist not anti anyone that is slightly against them. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:35:04
Lol, your place in this world is weak. Why would I personally need to do anything. You lose more ground to society every day because your positions are useless to everyday people. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:37:30
It’s a discussion board. I’ve yet to see a single discussion board where some people aren’t retards. But the primary goal and only purpose of antifa is to fight neo nazis. Without neo nazis antifa people go back to writings screen plays, learning about tantric sex, and other normie things. They rather be normies then fight wars.

Free speech is not dead. I’ve yet to get arrested for anything I’ve said. In other countries you can be arrested for your speech.
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:50:42
Because bitcoin markets itself as a real currency.
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:40:41
Normies live in tiny bubbles? Come on you know that’s horseshit. Where would a normie hear that term huh? From work? From tv? On a date? At the gym? Vacation? 
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:15:03
You’re missing his point. Leftist don’t claim to be libertarian. They aren’t being contradictory in their stance. Libertarians however have no reason to complain about this given their stance on free markets.
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:18:01
So mass adoption will never happen then?
@_date: 2019-01-09 05:09:24
How ironic that the guy calling me a npc responds with a soundbite.
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:33:46
I don’t really care about this. I don’t see any reason why I would.
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:24:45
I would tell you that’s beyond stupid. No one calls someone a neo nazi for disagreeing with them on which smart phone is best or which place to get lunch at today.
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:34:07
They weren’t completely wrong. I first learned about bitcoin as a way people were buying drugs on bodybuilding sites. Drugs, sex, money laundering, and gambling were the uses that spread what bitcoin was for back in the day. Not decentralized nerd speak.
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:58:28
We got rekt’d. A whale dumped on multiple cryptos at the same time. Stop losses were taken out at once.
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:54:19
Tell that to gen z. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:29:15
It’s a simple phenomenon that anyone who’s been through high school has seen happen a dozen times over. Crypto geeks are constantly talking about normies.
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:38:44
Good. Crypto will get faster adoption if it’s not associated with vermin.
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:40:23
It should not be illegal and it isn’t illegal. You’re fine to have an opinion other wise but you’ll find no support from me or the rest of the normies you call communists. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:52:24
I handed over my information. I don’t really care about doing so. The only reason I’m in bitcoin is to make money longterm. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:03:54
I found the sovereign citizen who doesn’t understand the difference between actual laws and non-sense he learned from some militia group that will get him arrested.
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:09:09
Complete nonsense. Normies are on normie social media like twitter or Facebook. Including a bunch of republicans. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:30:56
No it’s not crazy pants. Go ahead and try to report it to local law enforcement, or the FBI.
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:35:32
Because you’re directly searching for it. Try searching for men eating poop and suddenly you’ll see a bunch of things that will scar you for life.
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:03:23
More like “content policies” are a bullhorn you’re dealing with mainstream businesses.
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:50:51
It’s not lost on me. I just know how you free speech geeks talk. Hang around a group of people long enough and you learn how to emulate them.
@_date: 2019-01-09 02:26:31
Good. Gab is getting exactly what they deserve. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:19:23
Yes. Pretty much. SJW is pretty much anything left of 4chan’s /pol
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:31:31
It’s not illegal at all. Keep your sovereign citizen logic to yourself. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:38:40
People call you a social justice warrior for saying normie things like white supremisists are bad people.

Instagram’s inability to protect hardcore pornography is giving rise to porn only websites
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:07:24
I don’t care about this. He no longer has anything to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:00:09
I don’t agree with most people on anything. Can we please stop misrepresenting this as an issue about agreement. Most people who have heard about bitcoin think crypto currency is a scam. They disagree with me. But they still allow me to talk about bitcoin on every popular social media.
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:42:50
I still don’t care. Prisonor advocacy has nothing to do with crypto. That’s just my opinion. You’re free to yours.
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:19:32
I do it because it’s normal to do.  “Virtue points” sounds like some high functioning autist’s way of interpreting the behavior of regular everyday people.
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:43:56
It’s a war mate. There is no good guys in a war. There’s just the worst guys and the guys that aren’t nearly as bad but are still racking up casualties just the same. That’s why it’s best to avoid wars all together. Avoiding fights is the original point of politically correct language.
@_date: 2019-01-09 02:32:15
It’s a social network for racists, pedophiles, and other social rejects no other social network would carry?
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:49:38
Russia spreading fake news? No way.
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:49:24
Why would the defendant need to get paid? Class action lawsuits are to hurt companies doing illegal things that hurt the public and make them stop. That’s the point not self enrichment. As for you being pissed it’s pretty pointless to be. You’re just one tiny little human. If you think you’ll ever be free of the greater will of humanity you’re delusional.
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:22:17
It’s absolutley not in the most literal way possible and in no way is it unconstitutional. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:12:41
More like gab gets banned from every decent centralized exchange and is forced to accept bitcoin as payment. Pretty good outcome. Gab’s deserved suffering is literally going to help my coin bag.
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:53:46
Poor people win lawsuits all the time through class action lawsuits which republicans (the true elite) want to destroy to protect themselves. Otherwise why would I be banned? For being sane? This isn’t gab.
@_date: 2019-01-14 03:55:50
Pretty much yes. Which is why branding bitcoin as “free speech money” is a bad idea imho if you want mass adaption.
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:23:07
I don’t need to cope. I’m reaffirmed everywhere I go in society. By every job, celebrity, person I meet, and women I date in the West. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:06:36
Lol, are you serious? Save your dark enlightenment nerd. I live in normieland like most of the population. Know how I judge people? Based on their own abilities and usefulness. The majority is never going to be far right. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:30:12
Who uses the term in real life? I’ve never heard a single person use the term. Or any politically nerdy term for that matter. You hardcore political people live in tiny little bubbles.
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:30:49
No ones head was crushed, which would kill said victim. Unlike the multiple people that were murdered by actually neo nazis.
