I know this is shifty. But I downloaded bitcoin a couple of years ago when is was about $120. I keep meaning to get some but I just don't know whom I should trust or how to go about it effectively. Could someone changetip a bit so I could see how it works?

Whoa! That was intense. Seriously, I felt like I was in a football huddle.

Whatever. It's Ben Bernanke. Wouldn't it actually be good if the price point was going down? That would mean that more people could get some skin in the game easier. Frankly, purchasing a buffoon when it was worth $1,200 a pop decreased the possibility of, let's say, a 20 year old college kid from owning a full bitcoin. But at $200, a younger person could purchase them and these younger person has a greater chance of actually spending the coins, vs an investment bank buying them and then sitting on them like they would do with any long term investment. 
The more they are used, the greater the adoption rate, the more "investor's" and merchants realize they aren't some fad. 
They are meant to be used as currency anyway. Normal people rarely enter in long term exchange contracts as investments because of the inherent volatility of them. 
Also, if it was worthless, wouldn't the government NOT seize the bitcoins from silk roads 1 and 2? Did they seize all of the dust bunnies from each raid? Or did they keep the dog hair lifted from their couches?

"Federal Reserve was first produced in 1913 and is still in operation today. People often debate on the preferred strength of the interest percentage that has been experimented with over the years, which has varied between a paltry .25% to a full 20%. The Federal Reserve is not fully understood by most of today's plebeians, because its complicated and refined tastes confuse most who are presented with its policies.
The Federal Reserve is a charitable organization as it contributes all of its NET profits back to its direct beneficiaries. No billionaires were harmed in the making of the Federal Reserve. Please be herded responsibly."

I'm a noob so forgive me.
I imagine that all of the money that is tied up with people who cannot easily transact because they do not have their funds tied into a transaction service agency, banks etc, has to be huge. 
So it isn't about the value of the bitcoin yet. It is about banking on the come. As in come and allow us to help you spend your money anywhere in the world. 
I believe that this is basically a measure of future liquidity, right?
I tend to think of this bitcoin drama as an ice age. There are MASSIVE quantities of ice (future liquid) just sitting around. Once you heat things up a bit, that water will melt and circulate the globe and these traders are more than willing to charge a 1% fee on all that ice compared to the 3-5% on the liquid we have in our markets now. 
I don't know about the "price" of a bitcoin and where it will go from here but wouldn't it almost be a stabilization of currencies everywhere if adopted? 
So if there was a 100% adoption rate from everyone in the world that didn't have a bank account today, how much money would be pumped into the bitcoin economy? 
And what would be 1% of that?

Let me reiterate, TOTAL FUCKING NOOB. I am just wondering so be cool.

I think that is one of my biggest pet peeves. 
"So true."
It is Boolean. That's why truer, rounder, etc. don't exist. That annoys the dickens out of me. 
I am all dickensed out.
