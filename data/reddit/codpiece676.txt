Depending on your fee choice, transactions can take 7 days---but your pending status shows that the TX has been accepted and you wait for inclusion into a block.

BTC now 11,800 USD-----watch it grow---ignore the down moves and watch the greatest bull run in human HISTORY. The hodlers knew it all right from the beginning. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:54:46
BTC is the new gold-----act accordingly as all experts recommend dollar cost averaging.

Fees are going to eat up all your gains unless BTC increases  greater than 3X. Best advice is to buy and hold for 10 years ----you may get richer than you think.

No BTC for sale now----therefore nobody is controlling it except you who is not selling at any price.

10% is a bargain because right now BTC can rise 10% a DAY.

Dollar cost averaging is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:43:23
I agree with your points but -----BTC is recently considered a "store of value" only to be bought and acquired. Too soon to spend it like a currency, as fiat money does a very good job. As BTC gets traction it may become a payment system------It will take about 10 years ( the next generation)   Right now BTC is rising too rapidly to be used as a money system . 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:01:16
No real issue-----the more energy that is used INCREASES the security of this digital gold---- and be certain that it is gold, better gold.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:29:02
Entirely wrong---miners are paid for validating any and all addresses which are bitcoin transactions. Once  validated , they are assembled as a block of transactions to the blockchain------then thousands of computers on the web confirm the same transactions  time and time again forever. Some of my transactions have been confirmed tens of thousands times. The confimers on the web are keeping track of which transactions can be spent and which tranactions cannot be spent again---double spending is eliminated and so is fraud.

Your gift is $8000 x .01= $80 . Assume price goes to 80,000. His .01 is 800 - 80 = gain of 720 . Tax free gift receipt, it is a windfall and not a business transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:55
Bad exchanges are afoot-----never trust a single one because 100% have single points of failure at any moment. One strategy is to open an account on all possible exchanges and then get in and out on a rotating basis-----split your trades instead of  big trades---fingers crossed.  Another strategy is to do your trades ai meetups but the best way is to get trading family members or friends to do OTC activity-----of course there will be a liquidity problem---nothing is perfect---every exchange up to now has been hacked or closed down.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:19:49
Red flags everywhere-----bungling amateurs---Just like Mt.Gox you are going to get caught up in their incompetence . 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:41:09

@_date: 2017-11-30 06:46:33
Total incompetence ----I predict a Mt. Gox failure, if it hasn't happened already. Watch your keys matey. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:31:45
OTC, friends, local bitcoins, bitcoin meetups, conventions, strangers in strange countries, stack IRS. Buy from many sources---never sell until you are in non-extradition non tax environment. GET an expert in security, learn VPN and encription,,,,,use off line resources and devices, use pencil and paper, no windows (linux and tor) The list goes on and on and will be a lifetime experiance---interesting. But your privacy is worth it, No twitter? facebook?
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:03:24
Eventually the older pending transactions are processed by miners---if not the blockchain returns your funds so that the mempool clears out.

True---good points. That is why all those coins of hers are being watched with hawk eyes and automatic alarms. The BTC market price assumes these are lost coins but if one coin moves the BTC price will drop 2/17 = 11%. Not too bad.

Now you buy a bitcoin anywhere you can and send it to your paper wallet address---public address. Send it there from Coinbase using their "WITHDRAW" function. OR you can leave it in Coinbase at your risk.

Satoshi has locked up about 1.8 Million and about 200,000 lost. Best round estimate.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:30:36
Futures price are part of price discovery. BTC traders will follow futures activity and as a result will buy or sell BTC. For BTC this can be a blessing or a curse----I tend to feel it a curse--- look at silver and gold prices being so repressed.

@_date: 2017-11-04 07:50:54
Each bitcoin has 100,000,000 Satoshi's---enough for the whole world eventually. The asset value derives from the effort to create these super free and secure commodity satoshi's. The miners earn $15,000,000 per day with capital equipment worth billions of dollars. Market cap. of BTC is 100B supported by fintech investments of many billions. The 21M will be mined for the next 140 years and transaction fees will surpass mining rewards gradually.  All this said ----- the USD will not be replaced , nor the Yuan or the Euro for the next 100 years.

Obviously if the overall long  trend is upward-----weekly is best because you are buying at lower prices than the upward average. You are also buying at the dips.

No difference.

Go to Blockchain.info----input the strings into their BTC explorer and it will reveal the full transaction. Good luck.

Go to utube and search "bitcoin wallets"
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:21:43
Interesting ----- One of the downsides is that you lose any "dividends" while sitting in a riskier wallet. Core will not recognise 2X transactions but your 1X coins will be secure.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:10:18
Trezor, Ledger, Keepkey---they are all good , eliminates risky Coinbase and all other exchanges which will fail in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:16:20
Coinbase (the biggest) are amateurs swimming in a large ocean. Another factor is the huge Mem Pool--- Pending is that the system has recognized your transaction and it will eventually clear.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:12:08
About 10 to 20% of Bcash, I have heard as there is a downward support feeling as well as a gathering of Core forces to actively resist the attack with software updates with  surprising defence measures. Good luck everybody---head for the bunkers. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:16:20
Right---anybody can send you bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:01:24
Right now a BTC is worth $7000. I like The World Crypto Network's way of expressing the USD . They point out that the exchange rate of  1USD = 14,285 Satoshi's . Thinking in satoshis is the way of the future----imagine when a dollar is 100 Satoshis, BTC will be 1 Million.

Buy for 10 then sell for 2, then you have a capital loss of 8, you then claim 50% of that loss on your tax return and get a  tax refund of 40 cents ( If your effective marginal tax rate is 10% ) . Simple ? But I do not think you are a crypto investor so you get  nothing back.   
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:35:03
Now to protect it--back it up--- paper wallet . I bought 3 dash a while ago for $ 17.00 and said I don't need to backup such a small amount---lost it and it has cost me $ 2000.00 A lifetime of Starbucks.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:23:40

@_date: 2017-11-30 04:58:08
None needed----test with $ 20 then 40 then 100 until you have confidence in that hardware----find your risk tolerance, because there is risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:56:51
BTC is a currency in the future--not now---when a merchant asks to be paid in BTC, not now when they have to advertise they accept BTC.  I guess it is going to take 20-40 years after the US loses reserve status. BTC is that superior store of value better than gold because it can transfer value with ease and without permission. Treat your BTC like gold---use fiat for living---never use your BTC safety vault features.

The unclean shutdown can occur because core must be shut down before you shut down the computer.

A static address gives hackers a greater  chance of taking those funds, although I don't know the specific details of how this is done.

There is no social and political philosophy behind BTC---------It is a better money system, as it is neutral. See Andreas Antonopoulos videos. It just sits there processing transactions flawlessly for 9 years going on 10 and will do so as long as humans exist. No magic just mathematics.   A first for human history.
