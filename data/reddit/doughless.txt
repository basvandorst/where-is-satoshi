How about VCash?

No, you have to use the debug console to create a witness address.

Current Bitcoin ABC length is 478559, so it looks like they've accepted at least one additional BTC block. It would probably be best to wait until after they've mined an actual block (or 6) of their own before trying to sell any Bitcoin Cash.
Edit: NM, I just compared hashes for block 478566 on both chains, and it looks like the split is complete. I didn't bother checking the hashes for block 478559 earlier today, because I had just assumed the blue color on btcforkmonitor.info meant it was still behind, but not split. Oops.

$0.37 * 0.14 = $0.05
That fee is roughly the the same sat/byte as BCH. Once Bitcoin goes to the moon, even a fee as low as 10 sat/byte is going to be like $5.

I have 13.5Th/s (Antminer S9) pointed at slush's pool and have been getting between 0.002 and 0.003 btc per day for the last two months. With the recent difficulty drop, the pool is estimating I should get around 0.004 per day.
Edit: I don't know the actual minimum hash rate, but my payout per block is about 0.0003, so doing quick back of the napkin math, I imagine that with roughly 5 Gh/s you could possibly get around 0.0000001 btc per block, which would be roughly 0.000001 per day.

Possibly. I don't know about pi specifically, but just because a number has an infinite number of non-repeating digits doesn't mean every combination of numbers is guaranteed to occur.  e.g. 0.10100100010001 ...

I'm not sure if you actually missed the first have, or if that was the joke ...

If you're truly scared of this, just send all your BTC to a new (paper, if you're really paranoid) wallet after the fork occurs. Then you can safely import your old private keys into Bitcoin Cash.

If the fork happens, yes; at that point, BCC will be a separate altcoin. Of course, if everyone floods the market by dumping their coins, you may not get much selling them.

After the fork, you can download a BCC client, import your BTC private keys, and now you have the same amount of coins on both networks. Keep in mind that spending any coins before the fork happens, even with the BCC client, means you are still spending BTC.

What about trying to have criminal charges brought against the buyer? Aren't they guilty of something like fraud?
