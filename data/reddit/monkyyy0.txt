@_date: 2016-08-13 21:28:00
Nothing I blame satoshi for or even bitcoin devs for not implementing(getting it running and keeping it running matter more then fixing these things) **but....**
1. smart contracts direction; as it stands I really don't like the extremely subpar transaction "programing" in bitcoin and eth/c; bitcoin's isn't usable and eth wasn't designed with safety in mind; I'd like to see a limited state automa programming lang be designed
2. The halving is silly; the rate of rewards should be more stable, not completely stable mind you the news and speculation is good for it, but not to the degree that went on and the early adoption reward was way to high, all coins are basically premined, ideally I think an increase in rewards should follow a difficultly spike, to keep rewarding new comers
3. decentalized mining died way to early, I don't know how to fix this but something should be done about it in future altcoins
4. lack of different types of wallets; sure there are mutisig but thats not all that different; a bank vault is very different form pocket change yet the protocol treats their transactions the same which I think is frankly retarded, there should be a "lock down" key for extangages that pull back say an hour of transactions for when they get hacked  and freezes it till people can figure out whats going on, which of course means that transactions form that wallet can't be "confirmed" in an hour but that would prevent a great many hacks, we should also have "halp I've forgotten my password" accounts that send all its money to a 3rd party(chosen at the wallets creation) after some time delay so bitcoins more usable by the general public. Maybe a "fast tranasaction" wallet could also be made possible that ignores the double spending problem so long as your spending 1/3rd? 1/10th? of the wallets contents
*tldr* the coins should be fungible, but the wallets and transactions shouldn't be
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:27:07
"Proof of work" 
Without a system in place to slow down the process, a "cooked" ledger(bitcoin is a ledger not a currency as is oft repeated) could be made that would be near impossible to disprove
This is still early days of the tech, it may not be wasted in the future, but cryptographic proof is necessary for the system to work at all

I expect the hacker intentionally wrote it poorly.
The first story "1 mill bitcoin action of nsa" [anchors]( the price high.
And it creates the endless corrections driving more bids(although it still pitifully low)
Which in turn creates speculation "what if its true thats 1/15th of the btc being bought better buy"
So when its revealed as a lie or extermely misleading and the price drops back ; the "hacker" made a good chunk of btc speculating the price
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:30:32

Bitcoin itself only scales linearly; which is not good enough to beat the existing system that also does linear scaling with credit cards.

No, channels get unbalanced, while its possible you'll see "rings" of small channels that are more than happy to go clockwise then counterclockwise in attempt to get as much throughput as possible. But I believe that would require a level of coordination is unfeasible.
Expect payments to be limited to be a fraction below your maximum channel, so there are not tie ups (two payments trying to go thru the same direction at the full capacity) and so you don't get in a situation where fully unbalanced channels are in a situation where no one could use it.
Remember this is still bitcoin, there will be attacks. Safety first and a fully imbalanced channel is potentially useless.

Its in "script" the unhelpfully named scripting lang.
If the spend script returns true after being given a different script; the coins can be moved.
The transactions script has been upgraded once before without a fork; and it's completely up the user what script they use, wallets just hide it away from the user.


Not really, bitcoin would be functionally down until it gets fixed but there would be a shared history, where nodes suddenly note the instant block increasing

It doesn't need to be fair, it only needs to be better, consider the swap to paper currency. In no way shape or form was that fair, but it made international trade slightly easier, so it happened.

Its hard to say; this will be a market.
It used to be omni and colored coins were acceptable on bitcoin, but the heaviness of their scripts plus the block filling up the price whento high, only tether survived as far as I'm aware.
Likewise .5 btc may be more than acceptable if micropayments explode and every satoshi on ln moves every single day/hour. Or it could be slow adoption and marco payments between extangages and .5 is rather low for enabling arberage

New ones, its a very new problem after all.
Bitcoin script is very much on the safe side and still has bugs(segwit is a bug fix at its core)
Etherium attempt is horrible, but its the other one worth mentioning as they didn't copy bitcoin directly.
To succeed at making a coin your very much going to need to either fix the existing problems or start form scratch where the existing tools can't even help you, its not like llvm has a crypto currency mode.
Crypto currency is like the internet pre-html; hypertext is very much a type of programing all its own. Its quite possible before its ready a new family of programing languages will need to be developed or at least a very weird cousin of existing ones.


Yes; its actually very very hard. There are so many assumptions people make when imperative programing and those assumptions can't be made with money on the line. And to make a coin you're either writing basic or imperative, the other families won't work here.

@_date: 2017-03-18 22:06:46
Half of each bitcoin transaction is mostly fluff that most miners ignore anyway; by *seg*regating out the *wit*ness data you can prune nodes more heavily with some level of imperfect security.
They will also be updating bitcoin scripting to have all the "blank" op codes return the transaction as valid; this means updating the scripting to add features can be done as a soft fork

If banks pre-mined a coin then gave a set amount to *anyone* with a paycheck each paycheck over a limited time frame(a year?) if they used one of the member banks, they could drive adoption like we haven't seen.

I think a major credit card/bank coming out with a reasonable proof of work scheme to send out coins.
If they made their own currency and something like 80%(keeping 20% for themselves) of the coins mined went to people receiving paychecks for free, I could see it succeeding in a time frame that bitcoin couldn't reveal.

I think you'll connect to a payment processor, who in turn will compete for lowest fees to mercents(while making their fee's net to zero to other payment processors and have some sort of super network under it to speed everything up)
The real limiting factor won't be network speed, it will be how many bitcoins your willing to tie up in a payment channel, so the mercent will be paying *for that* they make their best guess of their monthly(?) profits and find the payment processor who can start that channel for the lowest rate

Proof of work. In order to make a bitcoin block you must find a number that hashes to a long string of zeros, the computer that finds this number then chooses the order of transactions, take the transaction fee's and gives themselves some bitcoin.
That means you can check if a block was generated by the actual network by seeing how many zeros in hashes to, if it valid then either p=np and whoever proved it rather then collecting prize money and noble prizes and maybe bring a new age, decided to fuck with you or it was actually generated by the network with all its absurd levels of hashing
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:58:37
Not really, having 1/8 the market value gets you 1/8th of the hashing power the fact they "cash out" all that hashing power unevenly form thier stupid protocol is the only thing weird, if they don't fix it the attack will die on its own

This was a r/all post wasn't it?
That wouldn't work, in theory it could only work if the money is used to grow the economy drastically
A) this is an anarchist money, (highly likely) made by anarchists, promoted by anarchists, you don't just assume competence in the state and move on
B) they airnt even trying to, I'd have to look up the actual figures but 75% ish of the budget is the ponzi schemes and war, war destroys resources not creates them and the ponzi schemes is just moving money around.
If it was 90% investment maybe I would have to defend that printing money is just a hidden tax on those who are to poor/dumb to hire an accountant, but a quick look at the way America spends money that just isn't the case.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:09:46
I would try greedy transactions and waiting.
You always pay more at market price then you can get with a little patience, even more so when supply of transaction space is super variable. Set the fees to 1/10th the market price and hope 5ish blocks get confirmed within 3 minutes sometime this month 
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:49:41

Most likely they used a book quote for their private key or something.
For example if I didn't know better I may type "But the soul is still oracular; amid the market’s din,	
List the ominous stern whisper from the Delphic cave within," into the recovery password system, its off the beaten path enough enough to not be found by the bots(bitcoin has hacking bots for weaker passwords) but its still far far form perfect to use non-randomly generated passwords no matter how they are generated and op got a little lucky.
That said bitcoin isn't ready for main stream use, feel unsafe; it isn't ready if you aren't *both* knowable and careful. I myself may know how to do passwords right(my email is behind 16 charatar with symbols that I use exactly one place; anything with money is behind 2 factor with that being the weak link), but I ignored common wisdom and got burnt on bitfinex while going full margin

Not at all, America at minimum has had 2 revolts that reach civil war status in its history, round a bit that's a bit like a hundred year flood, and its standard practice to pad mortgages on houses on flood plains.

When margining the market can stay irrational longer than you are solvent.
We have had crashes.
In my mind I think we have had 3 doublings a year historically, people cashing out, idealists running out of funding etc. and currently we are higher than that rate, if the rest of this month is slow ok; but if we have another doubling without a cooldown period its starts to look scary.

That is the very very wrong opinion that I would love to filter out in a possible sub for a baseline educated level.
Bitcoin has smart contracts, as does all its clones; so eth wasn't even remotely close to first. And that fact is the type of thing that doesn't show up on google with the raw misinformation out there.

But srsly you shouldn't support welfare; it would be far more effective to remove any taxation on labor, letting supply chains grow to be extremely complex.
If the market rate to hire someone is 20 dollars an hour maybe people should be paid 20 dollars an hour, not cutting off 30% then whatever workmens comp is then social security, then your employer's matching social security then and then and then until your left with 10ish dollar an hour.

And what's the difference between taxes and services? The state doesn't produce anything, it merely moves money around, services are taxes even if it's a hidden tax of inflation, and taxes are "services" if they gathered up cash to set it on fire( or more likely hid it in a vault), we would have deflation. There is no functional difference between state action and an increase in taxes in someway.

I believe that the lighten network network will work like email does; in theory everyone could own their own always on email server but no one does, you goto a handful of companies who fought harder and harder on space and cost, who build big special pipes between each other; until we ended up with google being free and good enough for most people; if you want fancy feature they are still out there but for a cost.
Likewise think credit card companies could step in and provide lighten connections very easily; build custom systems between themselves to speed everything up like the miners currently do to get a competitive edge. I believe the end result will look like gmail to email; it will be fairly good and cheap if not free, but things like proper privacy took a back seat and if you want it you need to pay someone like  who will be smaller.

"What political philosophy would you consider most likely to be satoshi's"
You could massively filter out the ~~idiots~~ relative newcomers based on those answers alone

Who don't do charge backs, who don't hold other people's money, and will need to compete heavily on price and possibly we could see accounts started with zero verified information. Yes.
Integration of shitty people needs to be part of any big plan, like with mining. Credit cards are already in the merchant hardware point of sell business, with special fat internet pipes between them; they are a good fit for the lighten network.

Form my skim it looks like by manipulating the transactions you can sometimes reuse part of a failed hash; I didn't quite understand how though; Probably best to wait for the youtube videos with pictures on this one
edit// with a 2nd skim I think I get it; somethings hashes are friendly with each other for some reason which I think is because 64 bits is being turned into 32 bits at some point upping the rate of collusion; by farming 4 way matching 32 bit hashes you can sorta pre-mine, by looking for the 32 of the bits to line up with half of the 64 bits.
How you go form these 4 way 32-bit hash collisions to a proper 64 bit hash is lost on me; but something.

In layman terms?
Using a system of time locked transactions you can tie up money outside of the main block chain ledger, so you do not have to pay the fees or let other people know what your doing.
Imagine a predated checkbook with the date on each check increasing by 1 day, you show this empty check book to your bank and tell them to only accept one check form it, you then write a check for 100$ dollars with the last one in the book to a friend, both of you keep a copy. The next day your friend wants to give you 10$ so you get the check book again, go to the 2nd to last page and change the amount to 90$. You go back and forth in this way until the date is equal to the newest check at which point either one of you turn in your copies to the bank, paying one fee and the bank doesn't know the when and where for the day to day spending habits of you and your friend.
Imagine you added one more check book into the mix and you wanted to send more to your friend's friend. Using a system of 6 new checks you could send it without making a new check book, using your friend as a middle man. He would know your habits (although unlike bitcoin he doesn't need to tell everyone and probaly could delete his records) and he probably would charge a fee but its likely lower then bitcoin

Its the 3rd paragraph that pulls it together; by expanding it to a network we can have trustless money that is instant and with *linear scaling* of fee's.
Replace "your friend" with visa. You open an account on a lightening network and suddenly you can move money to anywhere on that network for the cost of 6(if there is a single point centeralize point, something more complex may be necessary) cryptographic hand shakes; which are basically free.
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:30:16
It will absolutely be centralized, the less steps between users the less the payment networks get decreased by, the less data and less people who will want fee's.
It doesn't "have" to be but the whole reason its necessary in the first place is that we don't want to wait 10 minutes before giving someone money.

If I wasn't clear from my explaination; your money is yours enforced by bitcoin once the timer on the payment channel runs out.
The data would likely be centralized along with the benefit form the fee's, but there wouldn't be the degree of control like credit cards do.

I think it needs to be said, don't put bitcoin on a desktop unless you have a reason to think its secure; unlike a smartphone the security on windows remains laughable, this goes double for any pc that's actually used as those blue popups that windows over uses and trains users to ignore are a major line of defence, if you have ever clicked thru it, assume your pc is tainted and unable to secure bitcoin

No, proof of work only works on a planet wide scale as is
The chains would be spliting all the time and at the end of the day one of the planets would centralize all the mining.
I don't know the exact speed of communication between the two, but the speed of light eats up a huge chunk of the mining time, while you could make a coin to transfer wealth between the to it would need to be slow, average block time of hours if not days which would be fine but not for the local scale

Coin bombs will make any one trying to enforce it have a very bad day.
If you can get an inch ahead of the curve, you spilt your soon to be tainted coins into dust and send it to the censor, the censor then mixes your dust with their other coins(you group transactions when possible, to keep your wallets form getting dusty and its just generally a good idea for approximations of the "bin packing" problem) the rat races to detect tainted coins caught up and suddenly they tainted their customers coins.
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:11:30
That would create dust
That's one input creating 2 outputs, over time this adds complexity to the block chain which you will be paying for
If you use two smaller inputs(consuming one fully) that turns into 2 outputs so you keep the complexity the same.

@_date: 2017-09-23 01:29:59
This is a complex problem, is there a perfect combo?
If a perfect combo exists use it(write a brain dead algo for this); else you must decide between imperfect combos and that means which heuristic you want to use based off what type of on going transactions you expect in the future.
I would generally suggest never producing dust as the goal of the heuristic so: sort the inputs find the max that is &lt;.71, this is your first input consume it fully; the 2nd input should remove duplicates( for example 1 2 3 4 is a better list the 2 2 2 2, as you'll get more perfect matches) go through the list again a find min( (n - n-1)/n) take the lower of the two inputs its your second input use it to fill the left over.
In general this system should reduce the inputs you control, reducing your fee's in the long run. If this is for real situation, your going to have real world data to test with so I would suggest testing many different ideas to see which is actully best for this.

It's going to be a very very long time before the general public can even answer "what is Bitcoin" airnt it?
Bitcoin is a protocol for making an inmutable ledger of nonturing compete scripts with crytpographic proofs, with compete copy's mantained worldwide by a system of proof of work.
There are 7-9ish fairly complex ideas there, the one relivent to this question is "ledger"
If the fork matters at all you will get your coins 1 for 1 if you can produce a private key ,  as the fork will have the same ledger;  the backup words are a private key, so even if they didn't support it, you still could get your fake coins

We just need the asic market to hit the brick wall of whatever nm chips can be manufactured at currently.

 and we like good engineering here, not kneejerk naive solutions like "double the block size, that will be enough transaction space" or "just vote the right people after those 2008 bail outs could be fixed if the right people were in office, next time it won't happen"
Stop it will the asic-hate koolaid, fucking up an important player in the economy who made a large investment, is petty, no matter how stupid they are being. Just buy the same sane bitcoin after the forks, and the miners will follow; they are reliably greedy, use it, don't condemn it.

Its going to be hard enough to make "watchtowers" so users don't need to be always on. This isn't rocket surgery, the way payment channels work is by making special non-broadcasted transactions and you need to keep track of these transactions, unlike baselayer some data exists separate from the chain.
If your not online your node is useless to other people, they will cash out their channels with you if you try to do something like this.

Its one of those technicality of how bitcoin works no one really explains to new users.
Bitcoin is not a ledger of values its a ledger of old transactions.
So for example imagine two wallets, one with 1 btc form one transaction and one with 1 btc form 1000 transactions; these wallets *ARE NOT* equal, the latter will need to pay a 1000 times higher transaction fee.
If people were dumb this would eventually destroy the value of the eco-system as the "coins" get smaller and smaller, any time you do not have exact change you need to split a coin and you get dust.
People are not dumb and using any remotely intelligent solution to op's question will keep the complexity of a wallet down over time(2 inputs go out, only one comes back, so long as your wallet is balanced with actual inputs/outputs you should be fine) most(/all?) wallet software will handle this for you

While its is indeed possible to pay with 1000 dust + one good input, finding out the that would be a very complex problem and increases transaction fee's until you run out of dust, when that dust is probably better saved for a slow week and may slow down the network if someone were to try to to ask for degenerate transactions, for example the first 10000 prime numbers in satoshis

We have 15-20x the price but real nodes(i.e. core) are stagnant over the last 2 years. Even if you count all node's despite the political manipulation that for some reason was a thing, this is one of the weaker areas of growth suggesting a potential problem
The usual reason stated for this is that some potential nodes don't want to run at the current bandwidth required. Do you have a different theory? Its not like you get paid for it.

I'm less concerned with full-full nodes then with partial nodes being an option for everyone.
If it was trivial to update a "good enough" blockchain every week or so, with an intermittent slowish internet connection. That would be ideal. That is already not the case. If you want a copy of the blockchain you realistically need high speed internet and it to be always on *and this slowing down your other shit*. Thats a lot to ask of people who don't "get it"; if it was an option to have it turn on once a week while you torrent shit; we would have more copies floating around.
Segwit may make it harder to do a proper full node, but it makes it cheaper to do a partial verify in the case the state tries to shut down the internet and we are getting copys of the block chain off ham radios and other less than high speed systems. While fixing transaction malleability which is a major bug.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand psychology. The mind control is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the tactics will go over a typical student’s head. There’s also Skiner’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these tactics, to realise that they’re not just effective- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike psychology truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

I think they were trying to get enough coin off people speculating that they could keep their main business competitive.
The time and transfer fee's mean places that speculators don't play at, have middle men affecting the price so that it raises coin bases price as the middle men are taking risks and will figure out a way to be paid.

The gold market on the other hand is full of people who likely hold some libertarian views and are already willing to jump thru hoops to get their money somewhere safe; getting even a fraction of them will increase demand drastically.

... both of you are wrong, 2nd layers systems don't need even remotely the same level of careful security; thats the base layers job.
Lighten network doesn't use either pow or pos, it doesn't need consensus, and I fail to see why it would be common for upper layers to need consensus. It uses the base layer for security, with bitcoin scripts, "consensus" is between 2, 3 or maybe single digits of middle men; not everyone. You get "consensus" from by paying them off or by being the direct users, and limiting your harm and their unfair gain is enough security. You don't need the miner reward or the block chain to enforce ordering, for the LN, the middle men will get paid by a normal system and there are no extra transactions blind siding anyone.

We grow rapidly, it takes time for the newcomers to learn even the basics as they are "learning" from each other.
This whole "don't buy more than you're willing to lose" is technically correct but its terrible advice; that little pink thing your your head is predictably irrational. It love lottos and hates games with good expected returns; real risk and patience both are heavily discounted, while being the bread and butter of what you need here.
So the new comers who probably bought under some degenerate hype, feel their first day of volatility and the hype dies in them and they have neither: healthy risking taking senses or patience. And hear that advice, assume its good as it would silence their internal drama and pass it on and on and on.
I on the other hand I'm 100% in bitcoin, I've lost half *twice*; however I learned those lessons hard and am up 600% since my last buy in.

I was being very lazy and vague, I meant generate of list of difference between two inputs(n and n-1) divided by the size of the input.
For example consider the list 1 2 3 100 101 200
The "score" of the input 3 would be 32.blah (100-3/3), 100 would be &lt;1 (101-100/101) etc.
So the minimum of the list would be 100, so you would take away some tiny value from that 100 to make 99.blah
Over time I believe this should turn any list of inputs into something like 1 2 4 8 16 32 etc. or something like it, but like I said to op test it.

I don't see how depth of recessions is a valid indicator.
Possible null hypnosis not given any time to shine:
1. State intervention causes mild recessions that are different somehow from natural recessions 
2. State intervention is correlated with time, and decreases in severity of recessions are correlated with time; the many other factors correlated with time like increase population, technological growth, better information for investors, *more information for economists to study*, speed of investment, etc. any number of these could have a deeper causal relationship.
3. etc.

The worse bugs are logic bugs, for example "list 1-10" "if x = 10 end else add 1, print x jump start"
Has two off by one errors, but will compile just fine. Generally you test these sorts of bugs by giving it real data and seeing what happens, but you can't really give fake money on the fake blockchain and expect hakers to try to attack as hard.
A different approach that's slower and annoying that math poeple like is mathatical correctness; which yes when money is involved doing the annoying way is ok, but it requires math friendly programing language, which niether of the two we have are.

You don't understand proof of work.
Its the law of supply and demand, it doesn't matter how valuable breathing is you don't pay the trees because they do it for free, the mining is all about making one persons opinion of what the data should say more valuable then another, so that there is one immutable ledger; we have mutable data they are called data bases and they get hacked all the time, the lottery of mining is to make it so one version of data is authoritative over another without existing trust.

@_date: 2017-05-13 04:22:51
The standards won't work for generalized id systems, you can assume manufactures won't be obeying standards of randomness so you can't salt a hash properly, meaning rainbow tables will come into play for a large number of systems. Those large number of systems will make botnets that will brute force other improper hashed systems. So you need to do something near impossible, slow down rainbow tables with a prize of lots of computing power without any of the current ways people fight large botnets

He mixed up the arguments
Eth was criticized on at least two fronts, Turing completeness and imperative, he took the argument about the imperative side and applied to to turing compete; which sorta works(because imperative = turing compete almost always) but its not the real/full criticism floating around 
Side effecty code when money is involved and malicious non-halting code are related but they are not the same, massing them together to talk about non-malicious *accidental* non-halting code doesn't really apply to either criticism

It isn't, but the currency in question is
Bitcoin goes back to a hard currency while most modern money is very very soft. A bank of a soft currency can only fuck you over slowly, a bank of a hard currency can get away with a full fuckover by emptying the vault.
If you want to trust a bank your in this game to early, we will likely have such systems eventually they did after fractionally reserve gold with meaningless paper(and in theory you could set it up so when there is a bank run everyone gets the reserve part of their currency via smart contracts) but thats not today this is a game that took century's for paper to kill gold, only the opening moves of this empire are in place.

Yes, reducing the number of bits below the what the information its encrypting is hard. The only "perfect" encryption is the one time pad i.e. the key and message are 1 to 1, the witness data being "huge" while in theory is fixable, doing so would likely be very very hard, better to stick with battle tested stuff when ever possible.

Maybe eth isn't completely retarded and someone fixes the issues it's having on a 2nd layer coding lib or a 2nd language compiling into retard gas; not likely but maybe, in which case eth may just out scale bitcoin.

Its balancing trust with headaches not balencing trust with actaul money. Which while any trust is not ideal, you have to be actively malicious to cause headaches; I'm only aware of the dmv and comcast who do this, while the number of poeple who I wouldn't trust with money is far higher.
Its not perfect but it won't be profitible to be a dick locking up other poeple money, most likely they will slap a small fee on ending a channel early and call it a day, or those who are properly political targets (like wikileaks) will need to use lightning providers who are outside the reach of the state at the right price. But thats better then paypal or credit cards and if the price is low enough even at scale; it will be worth using.

They picked the worse programming language base for thier problem. They could have gone dumb like the internet, HTML doesn't speard viruses.... much, simply because its weak. They could have gone with functional, like the proper banks, as side effects are scary when money is on the line and math can be proven to work as expected. They could have followed one of the Bitcoin devs off hand advice and make the program come with proof its finite and not increasing the money supply in order to compile at all.
But nope they slapped gas on java and shipped. As far as I'm concerned they can shove thier language up thier ass. It needs to die, and soon before dao's becomes a yearly crisis.

c)you can have uncertainty if the worse case is rare enough and the average case is amazing; random algorithms have been a staple of computer science for a while, I'm not sure which part your talking about(you're using wrong terminology and vague) but its likely a nonissue so long as on average is fast

Low fee
Honestly if it isn't urgent see how much the mem pool clears,  its down 80%  this month maybe it will go through at the single penny fee you gave
Transactions are strictly highest bidder, and 2 months ago a penny wasn't going to cut it so most nodes would prune it; now that the mempool is lower the nodes that save everything must of resent it out and while its optimistic at the moment it may go through at a drop.
edit// for example this transaction just went through

Your not thinking like an asshole, or a state; but I repeat myself.
You can simply refuse to do any transactions for the life span of the payment network, presumably these things will want to be very very long life spans. Then the money can be tied up for as long as the market is greedy. If we are talking a year and you put in your living expenses for a few months expecting to buy groceries and politics attacks you for whatever reason, your in for a very bad time.

That depends wildly on the network effects; the difference between unusable and 6 degrees of kevin bacon is a tiny rate of scale.
I want to say if you get the average number of channels per user to e you get a nice network but I'm not sure, but its not a big number to get a good network going

Security is not proportional to difficulty, and hasn't been stable throughout bitcoin life span. It started out very weak, it grew a bit once the black market started to like bitcoin but it wasn't until asic mining that we gained any level of security, before that point the cia could have done a 51% attack with a botnet it could have whipped out for cheap burning a few of thier 0 days, but generally cheap and not needing a massive public funding or needing to viuld new hardware.
Difficulty and miner rewards is a approximation of the level of security needed, it is not a law of nature and it should be reexamined every once in a while. If China actually bans bitcoin, it would be wise to start building a system that can counter a 51% attack, whatever that looks like. But that's not the current situation, right now miners are in a huge rat race and no talk of war is coming form anyone importain, removing fuel form the fire(slowly) could in theory help them.

After the scaling debate, I think we'll have a mining debate. Surely a 51% attack would require a state at this point I think we have long passed the level of security actually nessiery by magitudes.
Let's just hope the idiots pushing asic resistance don't gain any sway, and we can redirect a percentage of fee's to some charity.

If the bitcoin network is that mature that a single satoshi matters, 2nd layer scaling should be a huge market.
It may be a risk to cash out satoshi dust to buy something on the proper btc network form many different accounts, but it shouldn't be an issue for common users, you just keep that sub-satoshi on the lightening network, or you consolidate them on 2nd layer scaling(either by the policy automaticly solving that problem, or someone buying and factions of coins for flat satoshis like coinstar but with a gambling thing)
It would be like bank accounts rounding to the nearest dollar when buying a house, not a huge deal.

It isn't an alt-coin its built ontop of bitcoin.
Its using pseudo-transactions on 2 of 2 muli-sig wallets to group large numbers of transactions that only hit the network after a set date.
Pay a single fee once a month(for example) and having some control over who saw your transactions.

I think all of those models are unlikely
Mostly likely there will be a core set of nodes that are super interconnected run by people who make it easy to connect to them and to send a payment you get their ln provider and the payment follows you -&gt; your ln provider -&gt;their ln provider -&gt;them will be the shortest path with a simple economic model or advertise low fee's make it easy to sign up and your good to go, the providers will need to rebalence their channels how ever they do, but with consistent over sight by experts that won't be much of a problem.
