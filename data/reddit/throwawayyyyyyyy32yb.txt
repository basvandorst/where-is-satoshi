The putting on the street part is true, but the goverment can also put you on the street if you buy a house (ie regulations by the bad goverment so supress us) and atleast where I live you can remodel and renovate a rent flat/house to your hearts content

I dont think the balances would merge back into one blockchain, or would they actually do that?

I would die from laughter if SegWit activates on the BCC chain lmao

Wait is this the same guy that made the worst anti-virus software in existence?

But I hate bcash, I think its a stupid rushed idea :(
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:46:12
I wonder why they changed it at all, I mean arent they raving all the time how BCH (Bitcoin hcash??? what kind of retarded abreviation is that btw) is the one true Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:08:13
Because if you have one currency everyone knows you have alot less risk
Where are the Monero shills in this thread btw

That wont work since we are all paranoid nobody will trust you to send the stuff after you recieve their bitcoin - they need to trust you
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:05:44
Like with almost everything else in life, trust is always needed - yes even with cryptocurrency - or do you really think price would be so high if everyone needed to trade face2face?
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:20:06
You just 'write down' the balance of every user, if you still remember Mt Gox, they did it like that, after all their btc was stolen they just continued trading

Decentralized currencys will never become a real alternative to fiat money for a few reasons:
1. The goverment cant make money with it so they wont advertise it
2. /Trust/ - The average person has trust in the goverment and the currency - giving it a worth. BTC has noone to trust and no real worth and is WAY to volatile for a long term solution

We cant dump, not a single exchange is accepting BCC deposits
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:05:49
Thats stupid, its still your bitcoin, thats like saying "you pay rent? Not your home. You don't get your salery in bar? Not yours.", obviously you shouldnt store coins on an exchange or online wallet but that doesnt change the fact that you do own these bitcoins

Why dont you call it "Im-a-greedy-lil-fucker-and-want-more-money-thanks-to-asicboost Bitcashcoin"

Because in alot of countries you need to be a bank to operate ATMs and alot of countrys have very strict money laundering laws (which these atms can be used for /very/ easily)

I'm waiting to dump my coins too, thats the worst thing - 4 Billion USD cant sustain themself out of thin air
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:29:36
Well even if BTC drops to 10$ thats still 10Millionen$$$

Lots of Arduino UNO Chinese knock offs are better than the original arduino uno, by including male+female headers for every pin, build in buttons, and more build in LEDS
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:08:31
Pretty much yeah, they have no obligations to you
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:59:58
With trust, exactly my point....
People are way to paranoid about everything
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:28:41
Just because bitcoin was designed to need no trust doesnt mean it requires none......
Earn and spend? And how are you gonna earn BTC without trusting anyone? (Or anyone else trusting you?) Are you gonna mine it? lol
