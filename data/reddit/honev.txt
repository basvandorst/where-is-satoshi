All it made me do is invest more 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:35:14
What's happening
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:24:56
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:02:31
Yes but why 
@_date: 2019-07-06 13:43:54
I don't trade that coin so it's ok
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:59:45
Thanks man, I'm glad the community looks out for each other.
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:56:35
I would not risk my crypto like that
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:49:43
I have no idea tbh
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:49:51
Thanks buddy
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:43:48
Yes from manufacturer
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:30:46
I only trade LTC, ETH, AND BTC are they still good?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:00:25
This day has been painful
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:55

@_date: 2017-12-08 05:05:11
Hodl my friend 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:16:06
First? You think I'm a pleb?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:25:23
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:37:43
I'll do close to naked because public nudity is a crime
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:22:44
I do happen to know a certain blue whale. Yes
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:55
Making the economy better can also raise people's ability to have the money to invest therefore making Bitcoin rise in value. Trump needs to be thanked either way 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:52:02
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:51:41
Wish I had bought more 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:08:38
So we shouldn't buy into bcash?
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:03:21
Plz go back up Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:23:13
I bet this comment section didn't go down the way OP intended 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:48:16
Been hodling since 3.8k
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:56:12
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:41:49
How would I move my crypto from coinbase to an offline wallet
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:01:47
I bought at low 4000s cause i didn't think it would go lower rip 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:49:28
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:05:46
So far I am hodl'er as well 
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:02:49
Best crypto currency market app on mobile? 
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:54:59
Aren't the wallets expensive?
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:48:42
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:00:24
Very helpful thanks 
@_date: 2018-07-04 13:23:39
What's the cheapest way to transfer from coinbase to a wallet and what wallet should I use
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:48:51
What if I already bought it years ago?
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:27:20
I bought in at 3.8 and 4k. Never looking back 
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:30:35
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:53:48
Instead of selling just give it to me
