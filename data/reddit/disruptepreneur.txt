It could also become the driving catalyst for bitcoin adoption as it finally gives people in the developed world a reason to actually use cryptocurrency. There's a reason why even the bitcoin maximalists love this project.

Education/certifications are unnecessary (coming from the director of an org full of student bitcoiners.) What matters is that you can program well, understand blockchain technology and how it relates to coding, and you will have no trouble getting a job.  Contribute to related open-source projects and you'll be good. If you can't program... good luck (or PM me.)

We thought long and hard about building with Ethereum. Our original whitepaper, which Joey and Jack spent an unbelievable amount of time on, outlined how to build on Bitcoin Core. But at the end of the day, and lots of internal (&amp; external) debate, we determined we were best served using Ethereum. We have yet to regret the decision. In the worst case, however, and Ethereum somehow fails to materialize or function as expected, we are the best qualified team to build this on Bitcoin. We love BTC, but in this case, it was not the best technical solution, given some yet-to-be-proven assumptions. Only time will tell...

Coinbase has zero interest in tracking your transactions once it has left their wallet (assuming it is not being sent to one of the aforementioned parties.) They do not want to track their customers any more than they are required to by law (their compliance/legal team is already healthily overwhelmed.) And no, I do not work for Coinbase, nor do I use them. However, I do sympathize for all the chaste they get following the law.

From our preliminary discussions, it sounds like they're genuinely interested in Bitcoin and see it as the future (and thus want to capture the nitty gritty at its birth.) It's in our personal interests not to turn this into "Real World: Silicon Valley"!

Apparently someone's been in a sexual harassment lawsuit. I just said "Let's just reinforce themes of misogyny" (sarcastically.) I did not call the OP a misogynist. I was referring to how the unnecessary use of labels like that reinforce negative beliefs about this community. As someone that often represents bitcoiners/Silicon Valley to outsiders, this is a troubling trend that we're better off addressing than defending... 
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:06:28
In a case like this, yes, absolutely. Obviously not in all cases, but limited centralization isn't *awful*, especially if means being able to identify actors in the system to an extent.

Scientific American wasn't scientific enough to realize Bitpay isn't an exchange lol

I started a thread between OP, BitGo, and Bitmain, and, I don't know what liberty I have in revealing the details, but BitGo has offered a very hearty bug bounty (the largest I've ever seen given out in this industry) for finding this error, given that Bitmain returns the BTC (and considering I know the folks there and they've already asked for OP's BTC address, I'm quite inclined to say that will happen.)
Furthermore, we should give pause to recognize that THIS is how an immutable currency like bitcoin can truly work in the long run. It demands professionalism and ethics, but I believe this is entirely achievable, as demonstrated by the fantastic work done by BitGo and BitMain today. I am more bullish today than I've ever been before about this technology (and Bitcoin has *consumed* my life for the past year.)

Blockstream, (almost frighteningly), supports nearly half of all core developers (depending on your definition.) 
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:57:32
Thank you. I'm not sure which reply you referring to. However, I have met the majority of core developers and not one of them seems to be hurting. u/petertodd may sleep on my couch sometimes, but that is a matter of convenience! Perhaps he can provide a dissenting viewpoint, but as Gavin said recently, it's really up to the Core Devs to figure out how to survive (which, in summary, it does not appear to be something many of them are struggling with.) However, if we do want a nonpartisan entity funding core development, I would point to the recently announced DCI (Digital Currency Initiative) out of MIT.

That's a good question. BitGo, from what I'm aware, is insured against situations like this (hence why you should use insured, trustworthy companies,) so I believe the losses would still have been covered. Moreover, mining is inevitably becoming centralized. As bad as that sounds, it makes the vast majority of the players in the ecosystem recognizable. This, I believe, will be one of the inevitable long term consequences of a company like 21 inc. succeeding. There are anonymous miners not using pools, but that will happen less and less as this industry grows and mining becomes more and more costly (and cheaper for the top dawgs.)
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:42:39
MIT Media Lab actually is not funded nor governed by MIT (in another egregiously false article title from CT.) In fact, it's funded almost entirely by corporations and other outside entities (including DARPA.) As bad as that sounds, I really applaud this effort and knowing Brian Forde personally, can say that they will do a stellar job.

It's integral to our success (in my mind, not speaking for Joey), in that we recognize bitcoin's value as currency (and the ease with which it can be bought). We believe that the vast majority of users are going to be buying BTC to participate in our software, and since it's not being exchanged for fiat when it enters our system (thus not creating downward sell pressure), it benefits the ecosystem as a whole.

"The Lab's primary source of funding comes from more than 80 corporate sponsors whose businesses range from electronics to entertainment, furniture to finance, and toys to telecommunications. Sponsorship, available in several different options, provides a unique opportunity for corporations to have access to a valuable resource for conducting research that is too costly or too "far out" to be accommodated within a corporate environment. It is also an opportunity for corporations to bring their business challenges and concerns to the Lab to see the solutions our researchers present."
