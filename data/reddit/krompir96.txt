I believe this is the bitcoin thread right not the gold / diamond thread.

Well one can argue that bitcoin has the valuation properties similar to gold, but making payments is a lot more convenient with the bitcoin, since it is pretty hard to shill a gold coin I can imagine. Bitcoin is the best alternative right now if you don't have access to an army protecting your gold safe.

High demand and small transaction blocks, so in order for your transaction to join the ever increasing que you pay higher fee's. The fee you are willing to pay determines how fast your transaction will be processed, so in a sense you pay extra to skip the que. 
Bitcoin is a store of value, there is a fixed and predictable amount of bitcoin, so bitcoin is like a car that will eventually go up the himalaya, but it will have some maintanance issues on the way up. It does not matter howmuch there are, but how many you have of that fixed amount.

You should actually buy now if you have a coinbase account, because you can get Segwit2x for free for every BTC in your wallet.

Okay i changed it :)

Segwit2x pasts? What drug are you on? If you mean going short than yes, but is that possible on HitBTC?

I don't understand your principle. I though Reddit was a non-restricted platform to share an opinion. 
Since I am not familiar with the word Buzzword, but I guess by definition it is a 'popular' word with no clear definition. I think every word i used has a clear definition other than Segwit2x. I used more than one paragraph use your 'eyes'.
Polling can also mean to downvote, clearly you don't know 'wan't' to understand the purpose of this Poll and you are very greedy.

That is true, but there is never no one if you look at markets, there is will always be someone who sees value in your "trash". Your answer didn't answer my question though which broker or exchange offers short positions on B2X

 Poll :)

"Bitcoin"

I want to add that when people panic and uncertainty is high people, will either sell or hold. If bitcoin is going to win you should buy, so doing exactly the opposite what the herd is doing. It is risk vs reward higher risk means bigger pay-out, buying after the split might be to late.

It is about the restricted part, than sharing an opinion.
A practical Poll isn't possible in Reddit, because you can 'downvote' and you have vote on a person, so you don't have to lecture me what a poll is. 
Furthermore the community guidelines does not prohibit a user to make a 'Poll' or is against the guidelines rules. 
Since you could've also downvoted it would've served as a compromise, but you deny that. If I would be a so called "karmawhore" why would I give two options that are almost mutually exclusive and one will inevitably have a negative count and one will have a postive count. Using your theorem I would only Poll one option to get more points.
Lastly the purpose of this "poll" /discussion  is to get a number and not have an echo-chamber to get 'superficial' evidence.
