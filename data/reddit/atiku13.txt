Sorry to burst your bubble but as much as I myself hate the dominance of the USD worldwide, it’s not going anywhere anytime soon. Crypto currencies at the moment have a very ‘scammy’ image, especially after the BitConnect situation and soon Tether. As well as the multitude of other exchange hacks and robberies. Until better regulation of this market happens, we will not see many more people enter the market, just the ‘early adopters’ which we all are at the moment. 
I myself hold various crypto currencies so please believe me when I say I’m not spreading FUD.

I don’t want to be rude friend but firstly let me start of by saying that just because something has happened in the past, does not mean it will happen in the future. His point about the historical lifespan of certain world reserve currencies does make for an interesting topic. All one has to do is take a look at the current affairs in the world today and think ‘Is one if the strongest countries in the world going to let its currency fail without a fight?’. As the first comment on the video on the actual YouTube site says: “The US dollar is backed by bullets...”
I do not agree that there is potential economic/stock market troubles coming to the scale where a majority of the world population would question the USD, in the short term as you stated. As I said earlier on, normal citizens who aren’t considered early adopters have quite a negative view on cryptocurrencies, especially the old men running the world today, what makes you think the masses would prefer crypto, something which has had quite bad publicity over something else much more tangible? He does talk about gold in the beginning, and I did NOT complete the full video, so if this comes up somewhere excuse me but over the past 16 years, gold has gone up 370.38% and over the last year 10.77%. So tell me why someone with basic and minimal knowledge of the cryptocurrency world (a majority of people, considering we are early adopters) would rather hedge against the ‘potential collapse’ with an asset that sees wild fluctuations and is unregulated and has seen headline after headline of bad news as of recent or gold, a stable and ‘slowly’ appreciating asset?? 
Unless I’m missing something important

I never denied that. To me it seems that your are implying Bitcoin was only used for nefarious purposes for most of its lifetime, which is not true. Yes Bitcoin was used to buy drugs, yes during it was used on Silkroad and AlphaBay. Did Satoshi make Bitcoin specifically for this? No. Criminals saw an opportunity and took it. Obviously Bitcoin was not used for drugs right from the get-go, so although that statement is slightly factually correct, I’d still argue on removing the ‘for the most part’. There was a plethora of other things Bitcoin was used for before the rise of these drug markets

Fair enough, I take back a small bit of what I stated, but this video does not mean that we will see implementation of this soon or ever, if they decide to reverse this. Aside from this video, a quick google search will bear no other results on this topic, unless I’m doing something wrong. Even on their website their is still no mention of cryptocurrencies/Bitcoin. 
Edit: Also by support I’m not too clear on if that is support the idea of Bitcoin, or using it to handle payments because I can’t seem to find anything to do with them processing Bitcoin transactions as of yet.

This is good for Bitcoin. Let it fall to its ‘natural’ price, which is probably much lower than what it is at the time of this post ($9191.54). Then it can finally be used like it was used before all these new people looking to get rich off of it use it for. The days which I miss *sigh*

Draw random line on chart, checks out

Yea NZ is quite hard unless you are willing to verify ID/do bank transfers. If you are though I’d check out either dasset or bitprime for NZ specifically. Good luck! :)

This is great to hear. The part about stability is very true, and I cannot wait until it becomes as you described again because Bitcoin is super useful under the right conditions. Hope to hear of you owning some BTC in good time! :) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:12:49
Nowhere in this article does it mention cryptocurrencies. Also, the company they are tasking with handling the payments doesn’t even deal with cryptocurrencies.
Didn’t even read your own post?
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:51:48
Yeah sure, if that’s your thing. A quick google search will show you a variety of things you could have bought with btc before this frenzy, including drugs. 
I personally prefer to get my drugs IRL though, from someone I can trust.
