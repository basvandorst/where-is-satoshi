Bitcoin isnt going away,  we are still early adopters and it's still got some stuff to work out but there isn't going to be a world without cryptocoins anymore and the big money is still in BTC.  We might have some limit to growth with the FUD that causes new money to stay away but with the growing distrust of mainstream media I doubt it's going to matter.  So in worst case we get some breathing room before the next spike :p

why would anyone want to invest in such an obvious scam and manipulation coin. My bet is that the backlash is going to be great and no one wants BCash
