Exactly, without starting to mjne this is the only way (besides words) that they can show their support, if BIP101 ever triggers. And if BIP101 triggers it WILL BE the longest chain and therefore "Bitcoin", just like back when the 1MB limit was added.

No, it also provides wallet services, which as one can argue the it kind of goes against the idea of Bitcoin (Be Your Own Bank), since it is centralized. Beyond that issue though it is an incredible service especially for newcomers to the ecosystem.

Well 'owning' an address means knowing the private key. So if you 'hide' the private key on the note and make it tamper evident it would work, as long as no one peeks on the private key, including the initial 'issuer' of the note. Pretty much like the physical bitcoins work.

Hey guys,
before switching jobs in March I had been working on this Bitcoin ATM (or Vending Machine if you want) project. Unfortunately I was too busy to continue working on it since then.
In terms of hardware it is fairly similar to the Skyhook ATM: Tablet, Thermal Printer, Bill Acceptor, Arduino.

2FA = 2 Factor Authentication
Basically it's an additional seeded password generator (changes every couple of seconds). When you enable it you sync it i.e. 'Google Authticator' (Smartphone app).
So to hack your account, the attacker needs to compromise both, your computer and your smartphone.
With 2FA enabled btc-e actually makes me super confident (for an 'online wallet'), because to withdraw BTC from my account, my computer, phone and email need to be compromised.

Couple this with your 21 Inc Bitcoin Computer. Boom 10x download speed!
@_date: 2015-09-22 05:43:33
The key of today's announcement isn't the hardware (it's a dev kit anyway guys, not a consumer product), it's the API! We don't know yet about the details, but we could be looking at a Bitcoin based, decentralized marketplace API. You could buy/sell basically everything that can be sent digitally. I'm assuming the key selling point of 21 Inc is for this marketplace to be safely (and possibly anonymously?) transacted through the blockchain.
Take the translation example from the screenshot:
Say I would write a little script that uses their API to offer a translation service, that uploads the "to be translated" text to a service like getlocalization.com through their public API. Once translated, send back this crowdsourced translated text. Send the proceeds to a charity project.
Looking at the commands their API seems to offer, I very much think this is the model they are targeting. Bundled up in a nice dev kit, that's not even that expensive (compare to ≈$1500 Google Glass) - a mass-market consumer version would likely be much cheaper.
As a developer, I'm pumped to see more details!

Yeah, sounds like a nice side project. I'll do it when I have some free time. =)

With machines you mean robots that you have to bribe that they don't kill you?
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:53:33
Same here. I bought a few BTC for a certain % of my savings. If it goes away... well. If it goes up well ... =)
I thought of 'giving' 1 BTC to each of my ≈2y old nephews. In the worst case it will pay for a dinner, in a good case it will pay for a vacation and the best case it will pay for a college education. *fingerscrossed*

I was there. He made it rain BTC, no shit! Sure as hell one of the most memorable days of my life!
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:49:30
O_o ...  in volume and  in market cap! Doesn't look dead to me....?
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:27:08
If it spikes you would still be better off just buying BTC directly, since you surf the wave directly.
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:44:08
Yeah not sure. You can get the (assembled+unloaded OR DIY kit) CryptoVest Litecoin for $2 to $5.

Do you have an example photo of the final hologram side of a coin? I'm wondering how good it would look in the end if I do it myself =D
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:34:28
Do you have ANYTHING to support that claim?
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:42:32
Looks like automated/algorithmic trading (aka a bot).
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:26:11
Not profitable. You can already build a better rig for a similar price many months before the ship.

I had PM'ed you about an hour ago, but didn't receive a response yet. ='( (I live in SF.)

Shameless plug: I made a quite similar site a while back:

Passwords are compromised just too easy. Consider ever user dumb/naive (including me). Look at basically ever "hack" reported on - 99% due to not having 2FA.
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:46:38
$75 for a $11,99 total of one fleece jacket? Sounds like its worth the hassle to me =)
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:50:44
You won't convince any serious user without allowing (maybe even enforcing?) 2FA.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:07:36
Yeah, got bored and did it on my laptop. Mousepad o_O .... =D
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:18:21
Last step was 100% manual work. I'm sure there is some tool that does the reverse deformation along such guidelines, then downscale it nearest neighbor to 37x37 PX (hand counted that dimensions) and you get the pixel perfect qr code.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:01:03
Made two transfers over the last week, worked 100% fine for me. Hope they didn't change their mind.

First three things you should talk about in any wallet service are: security, security, aaaand... security!

The racism in this subreddit is too damn high!
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:39:16
Does NOT look very legit to me.........!
@_date: 2013-12-31 08:16:38
No need to reinvent a whole qr code library. Maybe rather enhance one to do the deformation - or feed the result of the deformation into an existing qr code library.
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:44:22
Anybody knows of an updated price?
@_date: 2013-12-31 13:34:35
I didn't check recently, but at current difficulty increase, "half-off" gives you about a ≈two week headstart?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:28:24
The amount of racism is too damn high!
@_date: 2013-12-27 11:34:27
Because a coin is cooler than a piece of paper?
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:26:37
White padding around qr codes is actually quite common. Also could simply be JPG artifacts?
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:24:37
Well I assume you signed into coinbase.com and if it didn't ask you for it you didn't have it enabled (or it was disabled).
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:13:51
Oh, lol. I saw the video where Matt explained the mistake and I think he just accidentally said public instead of private there.
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:14:26
Monopoly is very different since you play against other people and can gain an advantage from that and general knowledge of the game. Rolling a dice is... well ... pure chance/statistics.

Beware while they pay out for small investments, they might NOT pay out for larger ones!

Why make a paper wallet when you tell them to create an online wallet before you even load the paper wallet? You could just tell them to create an online wallet and load that one directly.
If possible I'd prefer to just send the paper wallet by mail (since sending it by email isn't particularly secure) and the next time you meet them (if possible) you show them how to create the online wallet, instead of giving them homework instructions. So you can also keep it more gift like.

I would be quite surprised if that turns out to be true...
