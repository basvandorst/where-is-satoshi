This happens every couple months and then it jumps to knew highs. You must be new to Bitcoin. It is a buyer's market right now.

Robinhood has a 1-2% spread so you will pay 1-2% more and sell for 1-2% less. I think it might actually be cheaper to use Coinbase and you actually own the coins and can transfer them to another wallet.

I know but earlier today I bought an extra 2g of BTC after reading bulls are supposed to rally today and that usually there is a huge jump on the fourth of July. I was thinking to myself before reading any of that, "BTC has hiked a lot lately and will probably crash today. I should sell what I have and wait for the crash today". Instead I read all these positive articles that came out over the past few hours about today and as soon as I purchased some more after hearing that it drops like $300-400. I'm like wtf. It happens all the time when I buy. BTC drops as soon as I buy. I will even buy it when it is down but seems to stabilize and you think hey it won't go any lower and then drops a ton more as soon as I buy. I actually think that stuff is almost my fault and I cause things to go up and down or I am one of the sims and some asshole player gets off fucking with me. I will let you guys know when I sell BTC because I am sure as soon as I sell it will shoot up. Haha.. That's happened many times too.  Within minutes it will go up a few hundred or even the other day it went up a grand after going up a few hundred and I sold thinking it was done and hoping to recoop some losses, it's just how it is for some weird reason. I lost 40g during the big crash a few years back and lost everything. I have been in debt since but am still hoping to make a come back and been investing with what extra money I have at the time hoping to make my money back before the collection companies take me to court.  
So it frustrates me when I see these news articles hyping things and manipulating truths and I want to ask these guys where they get their info but it's like all BTC related news sites have disabled comments lately, which I find stange. I haven't invested in BTC in awhile but my buddy told me it was going to break 10k the other week and I told him it probably will and told him maybe hit 13k and crash back to 9800, and he was like no it will go to 100k. Then I saw BTC hit 14k and news sites were also saying it was not like before and that it was going to the moon and we were done with the crashes. My dumb ass was like maybe everyone is right and as soon as I invested it crashed. A couple weeks later it was back to 9800 for a brief period like I said would happen. Ughh... I just want to be debt free of everything and I know I can't expect BTC to climb over night but man I wish I would stop losing money and going into further debt. Sorry for rambling but hopefully things will work out this time.

Whales control Bitcoin and will continue to. I don't think that will change anytime soon.
