Pretty sure it's already a standard, I believe it is...

Miner from 2010, I don't give a f*** ever since a while back, because I mined up 300 BTC. 
(Had 11 HD 5830's mining 24/7 and turned my apartment into a sauna.)
**But SADLY I had to sell ALL of them before 2012 so that I could pay rent.**
I really can't afford to let the fact that I could have been a millionaire get to me. 
I am quite confident I would cry more tears, than I own satoshis...

Email services generate no direct revenue.
You don't care about that, go ahead and delete all of your email accounts. You don't need to do anything or own any.

Any transaction on the blockchain can be viewed as economic.
Imagine if you are looking at bank accounts of USD.
ANY USD movement in or out of a bank account is in raw technicality "economic" because there is a transition or movement of your comparative value source.
((Even if you move USD from one of your own bank accounts, to another of your own bank accounts at the same bank, do you think the bank just cancels that transaction out, and does not account for it, when analyzing their books?))
Banks take even self transactions, into account, when analyzing their financial movements.
At the end of their bookkeeping they may cancel out, but the bank will analyze them as a financial movement until then.

I don't like someone slandering Garzik's name.
I've spoken with Garzik and regularly attend Bitcoin events and conferences.
Jeff Garzik is one of the best developers I've ever spoken to. In my view, people like Garzik and Buterin are on near equal footing in terms of genius.
Garzik, you have a fanbase buddy.
Bitcoin would not be the Bitcoin we have today, without all of the work Garzik has done. People should be thanking him, not scrutinizing his decisions like he's a politician.

I think we had a miscommunication.
I am not implying that the direct USD-&gt;Bitcoin sales are the only thing affecting value, thus I acknowledge that number to be lower than $11b
BUT I am factoring in two additional factors:
1. Trades for value occur outside of exchanges, if I'm buying a cup of coffee for Bitcoin, that is a transaction across the Bitcoin network, though not something that will affect the books.
2. As exchange movement moves downward, buy trades are still happening, and vice versa. You are thinking linearly, but it's never JUST bears or JUST bulls. 
So yeah, flat 19000-18300 direct sale figure for USD-&gt;Bitcoin is LESS than $11b
However, factor in market resistance movements, and off-exchange trade transaction, you can easily estimate this number by just looking at the amount of daily coin movement, in terms of blockchain transactions, without ever even looking at exchange data.
Thus, over the amount of time exchange orders transition from 19000 TO 18300, you can look at the raw number of BTC that moved on the blockchain for this time period.
My numbers are in the right magnitude, even if not exact, I am willing to back my math on that, with high confidence.

I am not at liberty to disclose it's contents.
Bitcoin is open and decentralized, but that doesn't mean that I am.

This conversation isn't about me or my algorithm. I am not here for recognition. I am not here to sell or make any deals with anyone.
I have no stake in whatever the day to day happenings of this subreddit are.
I am just infuriated at certain economists that still spout about Bitcoin with the same rhetoric of an evangelical old woman shouting about how Satan made Pokemon to corrupt our children.
Big finance needs to wake the fuck up.
I mean, seriously, even Mark Cuban doesn't doom say it anymore. He talks about Bitcoin with the same demeanor he uses for petroleum speculation plays.
He went from "It's tulips and will bubble crash and die."
To... Having an active investment in the Bitcoin space, and using language more like "Don't invest more in Bitcoin than you are willing to lose."
If a guy with a $3 billion net worth can go from nay-sayer to bear-ish supporter. I think more figures need to follow suit.

Do you own a coin that you can adjust it's flip results to an unknown integer between 50% and 100% ?
You have misinterpreted my statement.
I understand your scrutiny, but details are important.

The only story about the hard fork, that you need to know.

Eventually someone is going to do market analysis and show that there is a correlation, between this gif on the front page, and market crash corrections(bubble pops).

This tl;dr is the only real summary that anyone needs to know about.

If distribution of funds wasn't decentralized in many avenues, Silk Road would have just been a topic in history books, about Asiatic trade with Europe.

Here's the thing about that.
 I know that.
 If they can do what I just suggested, then I wasn't aware of it, which is just as bad as if the idea wasn't currently in use.
Market exposure is important.
If someone informed about Bitcoin and crypto, like myself, doesn't know that something CAN do that.... Then whatever that something IS, is completely invisible, to people that AREN'T knowledgeable in the subject.
AKA, if I didn't know, there's no way in hell that the majority consumer could or would know about it.
