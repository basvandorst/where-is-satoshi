Sweet dude, I wish this or something similar were a permanent feature of these sites so I could get up in the morning, get on the net and watch the "show" from the night before ;)

Bitcoin is NOTHING like playing cards for one simple reason, scarcity. The producer can print pokemon cards forever, thus diluting their value to zero (and still charge the same money initially too). Bitcoins have a hard ceiling on the number created. Scarcity, unforgability, and utility combined, is what gives Bitcoin it's value. All you have is a few pieces of printed cardboard (that can be fairly easily forged no less) and a meme.

Yeah...... I also bet there are shitloads of BB knockoffs too. And BBs are useful *how?* Also, I bet if there is a buck in it the company that made the BB line would definitely produce a "vintage" line if it made fiscal sense, further flooding the market with uselessness. 
Your examples and comparisons are really poor, please at least *try* to make an effort here. I feel like I'm arguing with a 16 year old.

Yeah, that's a moot point with Bitpay and Walletbit et al. doing the Bitcoin handling on their behalf. Don't worry, they'll find another way to move the goalposts in their "not accepting Bitcoin" argument. The good thing is they look like greater and greater fools the longer they try to fight it. I mean seriously, what Business doesn't like receiving *MONEY*?
