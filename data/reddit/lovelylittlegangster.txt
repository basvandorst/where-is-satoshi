The blockchain in its current form is unable to cope with large scale adoption whereby every single transaction is broadcast one by one. A scaling solution is required.
My current vision is that the blockchain is used as a settlement layer. Effectively showing how much money each address has but not every single transaction needs to be broadcast individually.
That can happen if lightening network comes live and most smaller transactions are offloaded onto that second layer (or an alternative). Hopefully with the breathing space widespread Segwit adoption gives plus LN give we can be down to minimal fees again.
At some point we will also need a block size increase too. So the answer is multifactorial really... offloading transactions onto LN, increasing blockchain capacity with Segwit + bigger blocks while still allowing on chain transactions for big transactions (or any transactions if you want).

Good on you!
Without people like you using coins bitcoin wouldn't be where it isn't today. People go on about the 10k BTC pizza but they fail to understand that without that early commerce bitcoin would never have taken off as people wouldn't have been exposed to its utility.
I've also been spent tons of coins over the past few years but like you have some spare. I know those early spends helped my remaining coins to grow so it's all good :)

You are the one talking shit. The bug was present in every version since 0.14.x
Don't believe me? Read the CVE yourself:

You should see a reduction of 41% in fees for Segwit transactions compared to legacy transactions assuming all market conditions are the same.
Segwit may also eventually have the side effect of reducing blockchain congestion so that despite using 41% less space the fees required for the same priority confirmation are actually reduced even more.

Blocks are mined on *average* every 10 mins. The next block might be mined in 30 seconds or 40 mins. Waiting "at least 10 mins" is not a useful thing to be doing.
It's a 10 buck cab fare. Most people would just accept the tiny risk of a double spend. Just like people accept the risk of cheques bouncing.

1.7MB (approx current blocksize since Segwit) per 10 mins (average block time) = 170KB per min

You having a laugh mate?
Stabler is the comparative form of the adjective stable. Like good/better, short/shorter, easy/easier... stable/stabler.
It's on the fucking dictionary.com page they linked as I already pointed out, but here it is circled in massive red pen:
The OP is clearly using the word as an adjective so why are people referencing a dictionary entry for a noun and ignoring the entry for an adjective?
There's nothing wrong with OP's use of the word.
Oh and thanks for the downvote... makes you look stupider (oooh, another comparative adjective!) :)
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:50:42
Did you even read the page you linked? Scroll down to stable (adjective) and you'll see stabler/stablest listed.
TLDR: The title uses the word appropriately.

The rate at which Dash is minted Ian constant, so how was there a sudden influx? Are you saying miners shouldn't sell their coins because it causes downward pressure on the price? If so... lol! They can do what they want with their coins, that's the whole point of decentralization.
FWIW I'm not a fan of bitmain but if you're gonna give them flack at least make it justified.

That's not how it works. You have 15 mins to broadcast the transaction not get a confirmation (blocks are mined on average every 10 mins but may take over 20+ mins regularly). There must have been a delay somewhere between your hardware wallet, the node it connected to and the node coinbase were monitoring.
I've had issues in the past where for some reason the node I connected to did not relay the transaction I sent and I had to select another node to retry (spent the same TxIns so not a big deal).
Coinbase should normally detect your transaction within a few seconds of you hitting send.

I probably make a mistake 10% of the time but obviously an md5 checksum of the string always highlights any errors.
Before I figured out I should compare checksums it was a little scary but I've had that workflow in place for many years so it's second nature now.

There are multiple other bitcoin plugins already. They've added lightning support which is the new thing.
I'm sure I've read Btcpay is working on adding lighting support for their next release too.

Sometimes you need to be pragmatic.
These debit cards provide a means with which to spend BTC with merchants that do not otherwise accept BTC.
Until adoption by merchants increases they provide a useful service.

I was gonna say monthly.
Not a whole lot changes on a weekly basis, most of the "news" is just noise. But pool the good stuff together for a month and it'd probably be a worthwhile read.

The hash of any particular string will be the same no matter what computer is generating the hash. So you used this command in a Linux terminal:


You would get a hash of the string (the bitcoin address in this case).
You could use a website or a multitude of other programs to generate the hash if you wanted. Here's an example of an online generator: 
Just generate the hash of your address on one machine, type it out elsewhere and generate the hash there too. They should be exactly the same. If you make any sort of error you'll see the hash change dramatically so any mistake becomes immediately obvious.
May not be everyone's cup of tea but works for me.

You give up bitcoin and get goods or services back. The exchange is just being mediated by the card issuer. Similar to how payment processors (e.g. Bitpay) allow merchants to accept bitcoin and get paid in fiat without actually handling bitcoin.
To say you're not spending bitcoin is just being pedantic.

I cant remember the last time  I copied addresses or scanned QR codes.
My BTC hot wallet is on a dedicated laptop with no camera or web browser, so if I want to send coins I usually type out the address. I md5 checksum the address string to confirm there are no mistakes before clicking send.
bech32 is an improvement for me due to the error detection (but I still md5 checksum out of habit for the moment).

What is very interesting is how "spam" services like satoshidice (massive transaction count but no batching) and cryptograffiti have moved to BCH as it promised everyone free instant confirmations while BTC fees posed an issue.
So with the activation of Segwit, blockspace potentially doubled and then further load has been taken off by moving a lot of unoptimised transactions to BCH blockchain.
BCH providing an alternative blockchain for unoptimised services has actually helped the BTC blockchain greatly.

The description of the patent isnt too thrilling but what I find interesting is that paypal is obviously actively researching crypto implementation. They must be investigating all possible second layer options which is probably how they ended up filing this patent.
Imagine if PayPal integrated bitcoin purchase and exchange... that would be huge.

That's not true. Satoshi said the block size could be raised when needed. Seems unlikely he'd have objected to Segwit on the basis of a block size increase being an issue.

Can think of a load of reasons, most obviously the Core wallet is not easily accessible on the move. There are also a load of people I know who I wouldn't trust to secure their own wallet.dat files... using a service like blockchain may actually be safer than the core wallet in such cases.

Interesting graph, thanks for adding it.
It seems if the price is on a downward trend and searches spike, that is an indicator of a crash. Meanwhile if the price is climbing and searches spike, that is an indicator of a spike.

That is not true. Satoshidice was functional on the BTC blockchain until March 2017 when it rebranded to Megadice.
Satoshidice came back on the BCH blockchain in October 2017.
