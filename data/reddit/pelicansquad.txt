You mean, fiat becomes non existant, and btc is the true global currency. I concur.

I'm all for taxes, it's required for a steady government, however not keen on the banks having control over my money, there are 2 separate things altogether. Without taxes means there are no government paid jobs.

This guy above knows what's up. The people that are telling you that bitcoin will not last cannot understand a world where fiat no longer exist. Reality is, decentralised currency is the ultimate freedom.

You sir, are a genius.

You most definitely know if this is happening in a global scale which it is, is when banks are finding a threat with cryptocurrency. So that move alone proves the impact cryptocurrency is making; which is why, you should build portfolio on dips.

Agreed, but could you imagine if all of a sudden there is no police on the streets, military on the front line, public transport access or schools. - would be chaos looting on the streets.

Some sell due to weak hands, others sell to rebuy at even a lower low to recoup loses. 2nd option is a smarter move.

Btc is king, btc falls everything falls. Its the way cryptocurrency works atm. This is normal.

This question is what makes the trolls come out of the wood works.

I'd rub it in, only if they are calling something I believe in a scam. Good work!

Yep, the difference between fiat and btc is btc scarcity, fiat is recreated, and recreated which causes depreciation for fiat currency, btc on the other hand will explode to who knows how much, its all about its demand of it.
