In my opinion it's tooo dark.
@_date: 2014-04-30 07:04:34
sweet isn't the same as safe, but yep, you're right, they look quite good.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:42:26
nice infographic, hope your company will do good in Philippine!)
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:58:45
indeed they will!
@_date: 2014-05-04 09:39:06
Indeed you were.
This article is a brilliant example of what community can do for Bitcoin's development. And that was a really great job by all you guys.
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:30:00
Definitely they are. It's great to see how this country deals with all those Banks' restrictions, Aegentina shows us all a great example of how to deal with government.

How did you guess??
@_date: 2014-05-30 09:38:28
And that is the spirit! If we want things to change, we need to do something on our own.
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:15:28


yep, sorry, my fault. I'd try to do the very best I can to avoid such situations.
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:11:25
I think that their site is too dark in color (black), of course this is just a question of taste, not really worth paying attention to.
@_date: 2014-05-01 09:56:52
I hope someday I'll be able to do that.
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:53:36
@_date: 2014-05-02 04:06:22
ooops. 
thats what my teacher said
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:32:57
yep, was writing about those website, thanks.
and i've found some information about us agencies. 
I think that future without banks is kinda natural, so I can't wait to be there. It might take about 15 years, I hope so.

hmmm, now I don't get where is the connection  between Canada and blockbusters.
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:09:52
since there is still no downvotes i suppose yes.
lets give it more time.
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:25:40
anyway, thanks for mentioning the other source. In my opinion more links=more information, which is actually good.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:13:42
i think it's pretty relevant name - you know cologne for cologne and Bit part cause it's a fantasy about how Bitcoin could smell. They are taking donations in Bitcoin, if i'm not mistaking. And this concept is quite nice, btw. Not too serious, just for fun.
@_date: 2014-05-01 10:07:32
yep, i know that you can buy a house with bitcoin in Sydney (there is a realm agency), and also you can buy yourself smth. luxurious, but I don't remember website's name, maybe anyone knows about it, i mean the website whre dude sold mamonths' tooth
@_date: 2014-04-30 07:29:05
hmmm, not sure if i can find higher resolution, suppose this one is the best for the moment. maybe later i'll find something higher.
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:02:38
ouch, haven't seen that.
Anyway my rule is more sources=more information and it's good that Bitcoin becomes such a buzz word all around the world.

it's not me personaly, but yes, unique artwork for each story.
