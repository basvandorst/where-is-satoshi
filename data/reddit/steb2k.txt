So is segwit.. What's your point? 
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:46:07
At this point, being totally practical, I'd say no. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:03:57
Sigh. 
1.1mb, that's an increase in blocksize, but... Why bother with something so small? Effort vs reward makes that impractical. Maybe if we eventuually get used to forking, a 10% increase might be OK. Not for the first one though. 
I think that 4mb is reasonable too, that's been tested by the cornell University  (I think) whitepaper. I'd go for that,if it was offered in a similar way. 
With compact blocks / x thin, I'd be interested to see how the network copes with 8meg blocks. That hasn't been recently tested though, so until then, doesn't fit my criteria for reasonably practical. 
Reasonably practical also takes into account this code is already written. 
To my knowledge, you're the only one proposing to change the coin limit,amd the code isn't written. Doesn't seem practical. 
A five minute block time I'd also say is a great improvement to bitcoin (as long as the interdependent variables are scaled proportionally up/down - reward, blocksize, difficulty adjustment etc) - there's a good document by vitalik butterin about security vs block speed which tests the theory of 6 10 minute confirms = 12 5 minute confirms (FYI it doesnt) that I can dig out if you're actually interested?
@_date: 2016-08-30 07:20:06
Pretty hilarious you jumped to the wrong conclusion? 
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:17:10
Interesting. I wonder how the differing variations on layer 2 solutions will all co-exist...should be an interesting client battleground.
@_date: 2016-08-29 15:19:06
I'll give it a watch later...can you let me know what this problem actually is?


Well, the fork itself, yes. block x = 1mb size, block x+1 = 2mb block size.
There's obviously a time to upgrade, but the code is written, and a cohesive, known schedule can easily be arranged.
I'm not bothered about what the hardfork is, id actually prefer a BU style giving the choice back to the network, and get consensus that way. 
I like segwit (at a high level..I don't think hardforks are the root of all evil though). I like lightning. I just dont see why they would come at the expense of more incremental, continuous improvement in tx capability.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:41:51
Youve proved the point. Control over asset = recognition. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:48:51
No, because that obviously isn't practical and you've just taken a logical position and driven it down to ridiculous minutia. 
What is reasonably practical is taking code that is pre written for a 2mb fork and releasing it in core (with an off switch of you like) If it doesn't get traction, then you're right. The market has decided,the majority doesn't want large blocks. 
I think what would happen is that a) most people Don't care enough and would go along with it. B) classic dies c) XT stays as is d) hard fork passes with minimal actual drama. There may be some die hard 1mb blockers that try to keep the minority chain, but with bitcoins long difficulty adjustment, it's nigh on impossible from a 75% upwards fork point. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:39:56
Hang on. Is that an actual bot?? Brilliant. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:05:58
They CAN be recorded, if the tests I mention are positive (control, transfer, economic inflow). For Bitfinex, I would think they would fail those tests. 
No interest retained
No control over funds
No risk/reward transfer
No recognition. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:29:26
Aha! I've only considered the BTC (with the multisig segregated accts),i didn't think the other funds were included in the haircut? 
For usd, there is interest. Yep. That's one step closer to recognition. 
Re co-mingling - how can you be sure bitfinex money is in the same cold account? I'd think that was unlikely due to having to pay expenses on a daily basis, unless they're solely paid from the usd profit. 
Re risk. That's a risk, but it's the same risk you'd have with an operating lease of an asset - but you don't recognise that as an asset. I'm not sure it qualifies for the risk and reward criteria. I'm headed to college now. I'll ask my tutor if she teaches that module.

Here we go : My tub of cool new lego is too full. My parents keep buying me new lego. I put all the old stuff in a biiiig box,and that's fine. But my current new cool stuff I'm playing with right now won't fit in the box sometimes, but sometimes I want those pieces, if they're not in the box I might not be able to build something cool. 
I know, I'll get a bigger box to store my cool new pieces. Problem solved. 
Hang on, what if my big box gets too big and it won't fit in my room? That's probably fine, we've got a spare room. And also because mummy and daddy moved to a new house a while ago and it was bigger. That seems to happen every few years. No problem. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:18:46
Sorry. I must have missed the bit where I unilaterally said client funds aren't on financial statements. I said 'funds LIKE THIS' relating to bitfinex. 
I quite like this document for explaining it with some examples of both scenarios (recognised or not).

Remind me again, why does the average person want to be their own bank? My bank insures my money, (sometimes) pays me interest, let's me borrow more if I want/need (long or short term), I have full instant access from anywhere and can spend my money virtually anywhere at anytime. 
With 0 fees. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:44:20
No, you didn't mention it. But you probably should have to not misrepresent the benefits of segwit. 
Miners will make their own choices based on their own risk factors. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:21:40
i'm not overlooking that, you are taking a simplistic view of the situation. You cant just pick a single company and expect everyone to do exactly the same thing.
A bank has full control over the deposits. it uses them for investment, with full authority given by the client / customer. It recognises those assets on the balance sheet.
Bitfinex is not a bank.
Bitfinex does not do the same thing as JP Morgan.
It's fine. plenty of actually qualified people have replied in the thread elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:12:24
Sorry, to clarify - I haven't seen the core Devs pull hard fork code into bitcoin core. Saying the market decided because of a failed XT fork attempt is incorrect because it tests too many variables at once (not just a fork, but blocksize, dev team, inertia, day of the week, etc) 
@_date: 2016-08-02 17:50:25
Can you clarify this process? 
Network change A goes into minor release x.x (to "not force it on the network") 
How and when does this get backed out if the network doesn't like it? 
How would the above back out be different to doing it in a major release? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:07:03
I would think the other way around. Lose 67% and get it paid back slowly via profit redistribution

@_date: 2016-08-11 16:04:14
Of course it does. Small block, fee per bit goes up. Lots of bits, lots of fees. It has just as much to do with wallet coin selection, user interface, fee selection policies, but it's certainly got *something* to do with it... 
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:37:07
Sure. 
Control doesn't mean 'has the money' it means 'is allowed to do whatever it wants with the money' 
Enonomic inflow from trading activity isn't the same thing as economic inflow from having the money. 
I definitely could be wrong as it's obviously a bit grey with interpretation, I'm just stating my (slightly informed - cima student) opinion based on how I see the recognition criteria in this case. Are you an accountant or lawyer? 
@_date: 2016-08-21 07:10:49

Hypothetical performance gains as described by the parent post
Edit - just realised that was you... 
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:52:22
But then the next full version will have performance gains that people want AND a soft fork you can't ignore. It's a bit nonsensical really. Just have a flag in the config file for fork support. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:38:15
That's interesting, because I wouldn't have expected that to be the case for all. Can you explain why? 
Wasn't trying to be a pedant because in my original post I was talking in context about bitfinex.

@_date: 2016-08-22 18:29:00


...Under test conditions that would almost certainly never occur naturally. Let's be a bit realistic. All tests point to an *effective* block size increase to around 1.7 to 2 MB
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:12:43
But then in release Y, they are then forced to have the network change if they want THOSE features. There's no backout plan based on uptake, so it really doesn't make any difference.
@_date: 2016-08-01 18:53:08
Nothing will happen to your coins,you'll have the same on both chains. You should probably move them to a wallet you control and not transact for a while while a fork is happening just to be safe. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:06:43
I actually think it's quite easy to change at the minute, because we're still quite centralised (development, client and mining wise) - now would be a great time to make changes for the future! 
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:48:31
Absolutely not (on either account) - core is the dominant client. There has been no hard fork code in there. My view is that inertia is the only thing holding up a hard fork. IMO If the classic 2mb code was released in core it would get the 75% (or whatever % required)  majority fairly easily. 
Or maybe not, but there has been no release to test that theory. 
Put the fork code in all clients, allow turning the flag on or off. That's a real market test. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:27:49
Asked my tutor. She doesn't teach that module. At first thought, she'd think no - you wouldn't recognise client funds on the balance sheet. But then it's a very grey area based on very specific evidence and it may well be different based on all the evidence. (I didn't go into specifics,just the hypothetical of a stock exchange that takes customer funds directly and keeps them segregated from company funds) 
@_date: 2016-08-29 11:17:51
It should do, yes - the blocksize is 1mb, and when segwit activates we can fit around 1.7mb worth of equivalent transactions into it. on a like for like basis, until that 70% gets filled, fees should be less.
however, segwit is *opt-in* for transactions - you have to get all transactions moved over to the new format, so it wont be immediate - there are currently no(?) wallets that support segwit, and we have no idea what the commercial businesses that make up a large % of the volume of bitcoin tx are using.
also, segwit also changes the fee basis, so fees charged will be *different* - i'm not entirely sure how that works though. hopefully someone else can explain that for you.
@_date: 2016-08-30 07:29:28
You do have authority AND control,as a thought leader.
 You're the most prominent person in all of bitcoin dev. You can say it all you like but you can influence development, developers, users, community. You're incredibly smart, but you can't see that?

@_date: 2016-08-16 17:33:40
I knew they were rhetorical,kill em with kindness, that's what I always say. We might both learn something ;-)
Unfortunately, I'm fully aware of reasonable being relative to the person involved, unfortunately, if that person is an idealist (and the figureheads usually are, bitcoin, politics, whatever) , there is no reasonable, it's absolute. I stand in the middle. 
I dont think the core devs are limiting my freedom of choice, but I do think that they (or certain ones) 
A) have more power than they like to tell everyone
B) do control development and features to their own ideal (as you've just said) 
C) hand wave away any argument like the one above for full market testing, as it doesn't fit their ideal. 
The idea of forking doesn't really solve the problem of inertia. The majority of People just don't care enough,its the idealists that make it a problem, the people in the middle suffer because the 2 sides never agree. The mac Donald's argument doesn't really apply, because if I fork my own bitcoin chain I don't have the rest of the ecosystem. You take off the gherkins (because they're foul creations of Satan himself... ) and you've still got a burger to eat. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 11:15:02
tx fees aren't calculated based on the size of the transaction (in BTC) - they are based on the number of inputs and outputs.
unfortunately, thats a bit opaque. If you do a lot of small transactions overall, your wallet will have a lot of small unspent coin amounts in it. inputs combine together to form the payment you want to send - so having multiple inputs will cause the fee to increase.
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:56:24
Not sure what you're referring to...however,  I've not seen anything that proves the assumption the other way around (longer blocks = more security) from anyone. Until proven otherwise, it's the best I've got to go on

@_date: 2016-08-07 06:50:15
What you're saying around double entry is correct, but when you move onto the financial statements bit, you're wrong. There is no control over these funds, no economic inflow, and the risk and reward isn't transferred. Client funds like this do not appear on the financial statements.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:07:33
You're answering questions that i'm not asking.
If I run version X because I don't want to run network feature A, at what point does feature A get backed out before version Y if it doesn't get the correct network uptake? what is the required amount before it is "not forced on the network"?

@_date: 2016-04-06 20:58:38
*could* clean up the code...but then it would probably have to check for the old segwit implementation as well, leading to two different implementations being live... So,not great. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:11:59
I definitely haven't seen the core Devs pull any code including a hard fork, so the market hasn't got any chance to run Or refuse that code.

I agree they're different in many ways,and I'm not saying they have no responsibility. Just the specific question of are they listed on the balance sheet, I don't think they would be in this case. It makes no real difference to scenario we are in, just accuracy of the statement.

I do realise that (not sure it could get much worse, but still). I'm sure Andreas  does too. 
I don't remember anything about large blocks in his talk. I didn't have time to watch the q and a though. I'm sure the heading scaling bitcoin can include a lightning network solution, and the analogy works fully. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 11:54:14
Well. Aren't you a treat? No one is lying or being deceitful, just 2 fundamental disagreements between aligning bitcoin to their particular needs. 
A 'dumb' Blocksize increase isn't going to magically make 2mb blocks every time. It also grows as need grows. 
A 'dumb' blocksize increase needs miner and node upgrades. Segwit need that and wallet software upgrades. 
I just don't think there is a problem getting them both done at the same time.. 
@_date: 2016-04-02 18:09:46
well, despite your tone, I actually agree with half of what you're saying. Segwit is a good thing, but it's not a solution to the problem NOW - The 1.8x scaling throughput comes when the entire ecosystem is upgraded to use segwit, which is an uncertain length of time, and may never happen.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:52:19
The key differences between that broker example and bitfinex are 
1) interest payments - economic inflow from holding
2) co-mingling of money
3) edit -  broker is at risk -  risk and reward transfer. Bitfinex is not losing any money here. 
Bitfinex did non of those, so the case is a lot weaker.

I'd suggest that this post hasn't been pitched well if you expect a decent discussion. IE Gavin 'took it upon himself to post on reddit' - well of course, it's a public forum. 
Peter Todd's own post refers back to another of his own Subjective forum posts. No difference there. 
Bitcoin consensus does work on hash power. You install miners, yet get a vote. You're putting your resource to work. Rented or owned, it doesn't matter. 
Potentially this is an attack vector, if you can temporarily rent enough hash power to activate a feature...but that's a flaw with the activation method. 
RE The other way around, using bribery / blackmail, that isn't the same thing. You don't own that vote because you aren't putting resource to work.

Yes, but if you can easily aquire coins and they are directly supported by merchants, there doesn't need to be a discount. I think it's an interesting idea for now, but not sustainable /a killer app. (imo. Maybe we have different definitions of killer app)

@_date: 2016-04-19 13:04:30
Basic eli5 with no drama : Classic is broadly the same code as core, but believes it is a better idea to hard fork to a bigger blocksize quicker/at all. Core wants to scale all off chain using the lightning network. If classic gets 75% of hash power it will activate the hard fork code. Classic does not have segwit code (yet?) 
@_date: 2016-04-08 12:55:16
I think the protocol would very much easier to change than the surrounding economy. It would be like a hard fork, in that all software would need to be updated at the same time.

I think you're missing 1) the bit in the middle, and also 2) the end isn't subject to the same constraints as the start. 
1) a) 7 billion people aren't going to use bitcoin. or the lightning network. b) if they did, it won't happen overnight - a block size increase is perfectly valid for the interim between now and layer 2.
2) if we did get there in 50/100 years time, maybe 334gb blocks is fine. maybe sharding is also available. maybe shnoor sigs, utxo commitments,  compression, maybe it's actually 100gb. maybe THAT number is OK because the internet/storage capability has changed (Netflix 16k VR streaming for the whole family? who knows)

in that case, I'll be clear. 
you can say what you like about coinbase and their policies. 
you have no power to influence them directly. 
you've given up your full control by using a custodial wallet.
there is no difference between a users wallet and coinbases wallet, but that doesn't have a bearing on the rest of the points, therefore irrelevant to what I'm saying.

By interjecting yourself into the thread, you inherit the portion of the previous thread that you are referencing.

current demand would be nice, some room for short term growth. if lightning takes that demand away eventually, then great. nothing is lost.
however, not being able to serve current demand does mean future demand is lost.

1. Get an accountant / asset manager / specialist 
2. Pay less tax. But pay tax. See a specialist.

No. Ive never used turbo tax, but I would if I needed it. I've done tax returns by hand, and it's easy enough.
 Tax attorney or tax accountant, they're both specialists. I'm sure there are prospective considerations. However I don't know that, The only way I'd find out is asking someone who knows the rules inside and out, Be it an accountant or an attorney or a whatever. It would probably have been much better to have asked the questions first but that appears to be hindsight. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:05:13
Again, I'm agreeing with you,and saying the same thing. You can absolutely do your own taxes with turbo tax. But I doubt it's going to tell you how to efficiently structure your assets to pay less than the top line required value (legal loopholes etc). With 16 million, there is absolutely value in seeing someone for more advice. If it was 16k, just pay the tax via turbo tax and move on.

So, this sounds like a good idea. Is the scaling concept that we would transmit a blocks amount of data over 10 minutes instead of racing to propagate the whole thing? Is it bandwidth or total data that people have an issue with?

There's nothing magical about it. It's just a fact.

2) bitcoin holders pay it in inflation. 
I'm sure there are other ways to look at it too. Direct cost vs indirect costs.

In this case, it's probably going to be some very specific and never seen before seen code. Which doesn't help. So, you could Run it in a VM or fresh install, and monitor any communications.

I didn't say the issues had to same scale. Just the same possible answer. 
If you believe there are good potential uses for bitcoin, then to get to those uses, it needs adoption in other ways as well. Those ways (currency)  may not work out, they may be a stepping stone to something else (remittance)
or, unexpected (to you) outcomes may occur. Maybe once it reaches wider adoption, you will see a benefit over your credit card - Maybe dell will eventually see a lower risk (fees, chargebacks etc) , therefore give a discount. 
You may not see a reason right now. Hopefully one day you will, and it'll be because others saw the future benefits.

@_date: 2016-03-27 15:08:06
Did I say bitcoin had failed? no. Its a temporary state of mining centralisation inside China (and I don't think that can be denied?) - i'm not sure why everyone is trying to protect this status quo..
I don't see how a moderate blocksize increase will cause  centralisation on a damaging scale. 
It may decentralise mining by moving it from who has the fastest hardware to who can balance hardware against connection speed.
It may make some nodes drop off - great, we don't need that many. It may not, great, they're in at 0 incentive/a loss anyway. 
It will certainly allow more transactions, and getting more users on board.
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:51:10
I know that. And I've explained why I used half above. Because you literally said it. I chose a more Conservative 20%. I'm not saying thin blocks would help in that situation,because it's a different thing.

@_date: 2016-03-27 12:35:47
What 800 price point? Halving reward supply doesn't necessarily  mean doubling price. Think rationally-Why would there be a mass sell off after the halving? Some miners may drop off due to unprofitability. Why would that be a large sell off?
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:26:40
I honestly don't know why a hard fork can't just wait for X amount of the network to move to the right version (the new rules could be dormant for 6 months while the old rules still are in place), then migrate across to the new code. Can someone explain why that won't work?

Maybe a bit. However, It's not like it's an unknown change...

You certainly could. But how many others would too? Let's face it, we've seen that most miners are using the exact settings left by devs (75% full blocks) 
If the majority needed is 75% to launch bigger blocks, then you've got an extra 25% to cover anyone misreporting their version.

Prevent centralisation of what? Miners? Because it's failed. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 20:21:43
Interesting. Why? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:20:45
Costs to mine vary so much between miners, this is a difficult call to make. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 12:57:08
I know. I shouldn't engage. It's like talking to a brick wall. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 07:50:13
Nope, test net is worthless. The environment can be reset at any time
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:08:58
I don't understand the 12 month time line. What if it gets 95% in 7 days? We wait another 12 months? Seems ridiculous.
Devs are busy is also a puzzler. Take the PR from classic and put it in core. DONE. The code has been thoroughly checked and explained by Gavin, and the other Devs,thrn it can go through whatever core process for PRs. Bonus -  you've got classic and core on the same consensus rules, faster consensus. 
Chinese miners complain? Russian miners pick up the slack. (or whatever) 
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:52:38
Sorry, it was a rhetorical question, that's my point. Blocks only doesnt really help the network. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 08:29:28
Block size increase does not automatically double the number of transactions. 
Block size increase lowers fee pressure which means some of these old items will clear. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:04:27
I don't know how they're set up at all. I think there was a tweet uesterday about 'different logic for spy mining' but that could cover any number of possibilities. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 09:08:58
except they expressly weren't doing that...they weren't advertising themselves at all. (or any others actually, they were turning advertisers away..)
@_date: 2016-03-31 17:26:38
I think by honest, he meant 'controversial' or 'some people will think I'm trolling' but it is a valid question,and my answer to it is no. Concentrate on doing what is best for bitcoin and the ecosystem will route to match. IE mining moves to somewhere with a better connection to balance chinas economies of production/scale. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 22:16:34
Am I misunderstanding and miners don't have to pay fees?
@_date: 2016-03-15 07:58:42
From the release notes - 'Bitcoin Core now uses ‘headers-first synchronization’. This means that we first ask peers for block headers (a total of 27 megabytes, as of December 2014) and validate those. In a second stage, when the headers have been discovered, we download the blocks. However, as we already know about the whole chain in advance, the blocks can be downloaded in parallel from all available peers'
All available peers means Less data sent from each node per block chain download. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:32:36
Yes, but doing the fork when 60% of the network is on version y (or above)  does solve that...
@_date: 2016-03-16 18:27:11
I think you are misunderstanding my point. I want everyone to upgrade. It brings large gains to the entire network. 
For people to upgrade, the software has to be in place, preferably from day one (although now I have read on the dev list that it is "dangerous" to have this on day one - so, day X of launch). I'm not arguing with you or trying to vote against segwit. Just saying that i'm wondering how the rest of the ecosystem is getting on.
@_date: 2016-03-30 07:22:01
But they're only legit of They use the block chain in the way you think is OK?
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:51:40
Of course you can test a hard fork. That's what the test net is for. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:58:20
If blocks only verifies transactions in the same way as before why is it not the default / only option? What's the downside? 
Not on its own merits, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:13:27
No one thinks that it is the exclusive solution... 
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:53:59
I've always thought the gravity well mod should be adopted by bitcoin, just in case of a large hash rate drop. What are the downsides?

@_date: 2014-09-27 09:53:19
Good point. He meant 21 not 27. Which means the point still stands.
Just. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 22:37:59
That's the stuff, thanks for the update! :-)
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:11:51
Isn't that pretty good though? For the 7000 nodes currently using xGB per month (500?) we can cut that IN HALF, almost immediately with no change in functionality or fork risk. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 07:04:51
So if I buy cinema tickets with bitcoin for the new batman film (after hearing the mixed reviews) - I don't mind the loss if it's rubbish, but I'm taking a gamble because superheroes are entertaining... Is that a spam transaction?

There is no way an insurance company will buy large amounts of bitcoin. It's too risky at this point. Insurers are very risk averse.

They're not out yet and probably won't be in the next year... 
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:04:25
Blocks only doesnt validate transactions, so isn't much help for the network. Thin blocks still does both and cuts down bandwidth for everyone, no fork risk, can be done now,and replaced later if a better solution comes up. Incremental win/win. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 20:59:23
Isn't it so low powered (mining wise)  that even if they sold boatloads of them there would be very little impact on the hash rate? 
@_date: 2016-03-22 18:24:33
That's why nodecounter and coindance no longer count them... 
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:17:15
How long would a legit chain usually be?
Is this only seen in spam transactions? 
Would a rule to drop long chains be beneficial? 
How about a rule to prioritise the start of a chain to clear a blockage?

I'm pretty shocked that it works to be honest! Is that an actual shot, and you're running it in a gui?

It's that easy when you already have bitcoin....starting up, not so easy...
@_date: 2016-03-16 08:49:03
Exactly. So that's not really much help. It keeps things ticking over but little gain.

There are about 200 nodes on 0.10.2 - if they cant upgrade, does the network really need them? probably not.
@_date: 2016-03-16 08:26:29
Is that Fund but not spend? And also doesn't really bring any efficiencies that segwit brings? 
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:08:57
Is this being developed for a hard or softfork in production? (or does it not matter yet?) 
@_date: 2016-03-22 07:57:11
Ahhh, I see, that makes sense. However, would the orphan risk  not be a good deterrent here? It also assumes that again the miner has 100% of the hash power to game this system. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 18:53:57
Probably luck. Blocks are on average every ten minutes, could be more, could be less... 
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:34:03
A lot? 
@_date: 2016-03-29 23:00:49
Hang on... They're paying 5x the usual fee? I fail to see any issues with this then. He's paying his way in the 'fee market'. He's doing the network a favour by trimming down the utxo set. The only problem is there is no scaling solution. Segwit doesn't help here (I think). The lightning network doesn't either (plus, it doesn't exist..) - a bigger blocksize would help though..
@_date: 2016-03-15 21:02:47
A better question is how is the surrounding ecostructure doing with the roll out of the work to support segwit? Arguably that needs to be underway before the core deployment. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:17:06
But that's just bad management and completely outdated view of how things work in the real world. Either they need a manager, or a change agent, or just someone that can be their contact with the rest of the community. You can't just force through your own plan without doing some marketing/influencing/negotiating,it clearly leads to resentment. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 12:30:51
In coreThink, 24 hours this is worthless because someone else already does it better. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 16:27:45
I was just going by your 'factor of 2' for my 'half'. Based on 20% of the above numbers (all assumptions!) that's over half a petabyte of bandwidth savings across the network. 
There shouldn't really be that many isolated / fresh nodes, it's not like they pop up that much..
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:21:16


Which ones? And how does the assumed-valid in bitcoin core (which appears to be the same thing, but slightly more flexible in you specify your own block height) mitigate these same vulnerabilities?
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:18:43
Yes. I see that. But what's the point of doing that in response to a hard fork by classic? 
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:03:13
I wasn't interested in ethereum before and certainly am not now! 
@_date: 2016-03-19 10:50:46
Only? That's a good start for op, and the network gets the same benefit.. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 14:02:45
I think It's quite clear what's happening
@_date: 2016-03-28 19:07:28
True. But they aren't doing that - they're just going for what has a fee - so going back to the original point, the blocks are not 18% full on some arbitrary measurement of what person x may wants miners to actually mine.
@_date: 2014-06-24 07:47:03
Obviously step 1 here is be involved with and search a lot for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:45:07
If i'm understanding it correctly, a BUIP is bitcoin unlimited improvement proposal? This probably (maybe?) wouldn't be considered for core?

@_date: 2016-03-25 14:11:41
not sure I fully understand this, but, right from the dev's mouth(s) 
"Suhas Daftuar asked for discussion about standardness policy, the optional policy that nodes follow by default to decide which transaction types to relay or mine. The segwit soft fork will create a new type of transaction the same way the BIP16 soft fork created the P2SH transaction type, and just as it was the case that anyone who spent a P2SH output before the P2SH soft fork activated (and people did) could have the bitcoins in that output stolen so again will it be the case that anyone who spends a segwit output before the segwit soft fork activates **could have the bitcoins in that output stolen** if the spending transaction is sent outside of a block or if the block that contains it is forked off the best blockchain.
“I believe we decided to advise wallet authors to wait some time after segwit activates before using [it]”, said Daftuar"
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:06:42
You can email Holger Gundlach at support and ask him yourself. I have no way of trustlessly proving it, so ask him yourself, he was very open about it - but here's a copy of the conversation seeing as you were so polite about it.

Aren't these sorts of transactions GOOD? It's pruning the utxo set... Or am I missing something?

Why are miner irrelevant? They have to actually mine bigger blocks. Which the nodes then need to relay. They're both as relevant as the other..?
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:32:28
That doesn't make sense. 28 days from launch isnt the same as 28 days from a hard fork launch in terms of urgency. And actually, if they got 18% in 28 days after 75% are already on board, that's 93% total. 
However, nowhere did I say 28 days was appropriate. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:08:04

@_date: 2016-03-07 22:26:28
So what if they're disparate? They can still have a leader. Look at gavins current / past role. He leads by communication and education.

@_date: 2017-03-06 19:27:35
Excellent contributory atmosphere you've created! Keep that power tight in your hand. Don't let anyone else in! 
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:41:46
Of course they won't package a Malleability fix with the blocksize fork. It's more risky to do multiple changes at once. That comes later,one big step at a time. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 22:44:54
First point assumes that the malicious miner has 100% of the hash power. 
2nd point, I don't yet understand - would nodes verify a large transaction with 0 fees? 
@_date: 2016-03-19 11:03:35
That's good (others did have problems, glad you didnt).
I suppose we we can close this thread on the basis that
 
A) my isp connection can handle a bigger block size
B) your default fee paid would stay the same with a bigger block. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 16:55:02
I like that there is a contract with an anonymous hacker. Like that means something.... 
Also, this doesn't say it's THE hacker. Could potentially be some sort of recovery hacker.. Hack this wallet/guy and we'll pay a commission (unless there is a full explanation somewhere...) 
@_date: 2016-03-16 07:40:03
75% for initial turn on, 95% for 'no going back' cut off. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 07:39:34
Oh, I thought it would be a lot cheaper than that. A longer scale DDOS attack would cost a fair bit then, especially at 20mb blocks
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:24:41
Again, why would a miner act in that way ('miner cartel coin') and destroy their assets (I think 50% of the network is about $100m now?) 
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:19:24
How is it a defense? It's pushing all miners to the classic/old POW chain (because they're already invested) 
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:13:07
Of COURSE it does! You sign a document and it magically changes! Happens all the time. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 13:42:09
The problem here is, however you categorise them, the transaction group you don't want (10+chain) is taking space for the group you do want ("retail type" transactions). 
You cant just say that blocks are 18% full because 70% are transactions you don't want to see. 
They are still actually there, actually taking up space in a block.
@_date: 2016-01-19 21:15:00
I'm not sure I understand what this does, can you eli5?
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:52:23
Well that's not true - there's 2 solutions on the table from the big block side already (at least). It's just seen as a lower priority than the blocksize increase. Just like in the other side it was seen as a higher priority. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:13:42
They are both risks, but different risks.
The risk of packaging is extra complexity leads to higher bug possibility. For our first real hard fork change, I'd definitely keep it simple. Block size only. 
If a Malleability fix is as non contentious as you think then there will be no split when a 2nd hardfork happens. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:20:25
No - its definitely true. I recently spoke to the owner of  - he does it both to support BU (not as effective as he might think) and to advertise (appears to be working pretty well)

Haha, I didn't notice that until a few re-reads! I think I'm going to take the compliment and not re-engage... ☺
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:57:47
They're not larger blocks if the majority of nodes accept them, they're normal sized blocks. 
I'm not sure you understand how AD works. It's certainly not how you described
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:14:26
Can multiple nodes take a chunk of the transaction? 
@_date: 2016-03-16 07:54:33
Interesting. How does that work? 
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:20:25
P2P through an intermediary who must lock as many coins as all the transactions running through it. Who's going to have that many coins to lock up at once? Centralised big players
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:58:00
Sure. I could find a way to make your statement correct and incorrect without judgement. 
1) yes. It's not an official currency. 
2) no.  I can go to any guy on the street, prove its gold, and have them take it off my hands in exchange for something else,at a certain rate. That's like a currency. 
So without qualifying what you're saying at lest a little bit, it is meaningless. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:52:56
How do you expect to *see* censorship??? 
@_date: 2016-03-06 20:56:07
At what point do they? 
@_date: 2016-03-11 16:59:17
I meant the two results from scenario 2.
@_date: 2016-03-23 08:02:22
That's because it's not an attack. These are perfectly functional nodes, just too centralised and a bit misguided. 
@_date: 2016-03-19 11:06:57
The solution for op is to limit his node's bandwidth use. That lowers it's utility to the network. Running x thinblocks then gives us 12% increased utility. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:54:00
Bit that would make it an altcoin! Hard forks are BAD

@_date: 2017-03-06 22:56:04
Well, you've already looked at it (I mean..apparently. there's no proof that your FUD is actually true). It can't take that long to even quickly note (as you go, afterwards, whatever) - you've even just written a few posts on what you've "found" - which probably took longer. 
Unless you have an ulterior motive.. Plenty of people did massive amounts of peer review on segwit, and there were many bigs squashed. nothing starts perfect. You shouldn't really complain about no peer review, and then refuse to give any (even when you've actually already done some)
Obviously you aren't actually going to do this. And thats perfectly within your rights, just kinda disappointing :(
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:37:13
You mean BU doesn't have invalidateblock? I think you're wrong.... 
@_date: 2017-03-06 01:06:27
Thanks,yes,i did some Googling - it appears that is the one (and only?) long reorg. The rest don't get past 4 blocks (natural forks). 
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:02:12
Dont I have to deposit money at a node to use it thoufg though? So id have to manage my deposited amounts across nodes.... It's all a bit confusing. I assume most would be handled by the wallet, but all the pieces don't really fit together right now... 
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:35:56
What's the biggest reorg that ever occurred? 
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:29:38


It wouldn't, unless absolutely everyone used segwit, which isn't going to happen, as its an "opt in" softfork.

@_date: 2017-03-06 18:41:01
You're being quite vague - it would be really good to get specifics, maybe those issues can be easily fixed. It may be that the idea is worth persuing, but the implementation isn't - then implementation issues can probably be fixed with proper peer review (not just "I've found bugs but wont tell you what they are")
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:44:38
... Yes. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 08:21:59
So what about weak blocks (or similar) - that will smooth out the bandwidth requirements to 1x8mb over 10 mins not 30 seconds. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:28:36
I hadn't really thought about it working like that,interesting use, would (artificially?) up fees thoigh. Would need controlling, the uncertainty of what will be paid would be a problem, I think calculating an average fee upfront fee would be much cleaner...also, how often would it tick upwards? Couldn't miners just game it by waiting x minutes to mine anything? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:38:34
The miners have more at risk than anyone. The mining equipment is worth hundreds of millions. Exactly what scenario do you see where it gets bad enough to need to change the POW, leaving bitcoin utterly insecure?

There are quite a few assumptions - dataCenter count is fuzzy, as its difficult to determine what is what from an IP - but they both use the same counting method, so it should be fair enough. Data is also yesterdays (I only collect at midnight, and today wasnt representative of BU)

Its a simple TARA decision. But please. do something. 
Transfer - send the spam to another blockchain - not possible?
Avoid - You can go away - ...
Reduce - Real world strategies welcome?
Accept - It is what it is. Lets move on.
I choose Accept. They pay the fee, they get into the blockchain. What do you choose?
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:16:58
Wouldn't they have to sustain that forever though? Blocksize would just adjust back down... 
@_date: 2016-03-08 18:26:21
I'd say absolutely not, no,id think the concerns are political. There was a thread last week where the relay network was bought up, which is a more efficient but off protocol solution,so this gets NACKed. I think slightly less efficient but better than the current protocol is a great addition to core, it's not consensus changing and could be removed for a better solution if one arrives. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 21:45:33
No, that's the point of a fork. The money exists in both as separate entities. But their dollar value can't stay the same,and eventually the smaller chain will cease to exist as btc too.
@_date: 2016-03-28 18:01:19
That's the point of a fee thought isn't it? pay your way, get prioritisation in a block.
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:40:51
Sure. 
This entire conversation hinges on one thing. Is using nakamoto consensus an attack, or a part of bitcoin. 
If it's an attack to raise blocksize, you're right.  It's a scary world out there, we need to stop this terrible thing!
If it's not, and it's a natural function of bitcoin, this is not a security increase, it's a mockery of what we all signed up for. 
Your attack is my inherent functionality. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:16:11


Seems fine to me. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it wrong. You're free to continue a minority fork. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 21:29:44
Awesome, that will negate your statement of '650 GB bandwidth upload per month could be just 10 new users installing a full node'

@_date: 2017-03-20 22:35:22
Valid blocks is what the economic majority thinks it is, at any time. Right now, core and bitcoin unlimited agree on a rule set. Maybe in the future they won't. I'll follow a majority either way.
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:00:53
I wouldn't expect it to sync past a hard fork... 
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:37:21
So really, there's no innovation here? It's the same as a checkpoint (but appears a bit more flexible incase of a giant reorg?) - Edit (not that its a bad thing. just its not quite as exciting as i'd hoped)
@_date: 2016-01-10 02:26:34
1mb is what we have now... Does bitcoin not work now? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:48:22
I suggest you write a BIP to stop the "spam" - currently, it exists, it is real transactions, therefore we are hitting 1MB.
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:54:33
So... No hard fork of the blocksize because it's contentious. 
Changing the POW with a hard fork.. Not a problem. 
Great logic 
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:47:47
I see how that might work out quite well. You'd maybe have to sit online to babysit it though, your private key always available. 
You can already do similar by the wallet calculating up front based on past confirms /fees / mempool etc. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 08:13:19
The good thing about it is the remaining 50% is spread more or less equally over ten minutes (transactions received) . The 50% discarded happens in (iirc) about 30 seconds (block propogar)

Good job the nodes will punish those blocks then isn't it. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 11:08:56
If Nodes are soldiers, miners are generals. Your soldiers will never be promoted to generals, if your soldiers walk the other way, the battle continues with the generals and the soldiers do nothing. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:17:58
Thats strange. yesterday F2Pool mined two empty blocks (none by antpool) - if you've got longer term data, that would be great.
FYI - Those two blocks (out of 151) would increase the system capacity by 1.3%.
IE. It wouldn't help. Try again with a better argument.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:40:00
For *any* blocksize increase. Even one where segwit and lightning takes off and it's needed. This is shooting ourselves in the foot.

Obviously it's more than a simple one party rule - miners, users, devs all push and pull on each other but are jointly responsible for the direction.

Why would it be? I see no scaling solution... 
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:02:34
So why can't we have some trust less way to report nodes, and have forks launch when x% are on board?

You ever heard of the funny fact about the Indiana Jones movies? If he wasn't in them, the outcome would have been the same.. The nazis would still have opened the box. 
Your node is Indiana Jones. Miner nodes would see the double spend and not build on it.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:30:11
Because it doesn't help. most people know that.  However, large quantities of nodes are being spun up by both sides.

Increase the blocksize to 2mb,you increase the cost of a spam attack by 11x (assuming 100kb headroom in a block that needs filling)

How do miners steal coins without the private key?


Whats a time window and timewarp?


Fair enough. That makes sense - using a hash is a known entity.
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:05:43
That PR would a) never be accepted and b) users don't need the settings changed for them, the whole point is they set their own.


I don't see how this is different with core with emergent consensus patched in  or BU as the majority client
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:12:31
How about we remove blocksize completely from the consensus layer, and leave a soft limit (like we used to have at 750kb) at 1.5mb? then the limit can be changed when our demiGodDevs deem appropriate.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:54:51
That makes more sense, thanks ;-) good job. Nice to know this is still possible. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:13:59
I'd like you to explain the bit you think I don't understand that is relevant to this... 
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:27:56
I don't see why that couldn't be automated 
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:35:44
I actually haven't got chance to look at it,no,so thanks. I'm not sure what the problem that solves is. Thin clients have no need to know about blocksize at all. It doesn't enhance their security in any way,  It just stops makes it harder to move away from a 1mb blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:34:44
It's a good thing this is all covered in the white paper that we all signed up to

Bitcoin doesn't distinguish, microtransactions or not. 
Bitcoin Core has a vision where bitcoin does care, and is implementing that vision.
@_date: 2016-06-06 21:23:31
Its not rocket science if you think about it for 3 seconds..
"Yes we've seen you've just made a transaction to us, thanks! now sit tight while we wait for x confirmations"
Makes all the difference to the user experience. Just like a loading bar. Or a little spinning colour wheel. or any number of widely used things.
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:49:42
Sure. That's quite a big number. Got any data to back it up though? Or is it purely a theoretical risk? 
What happens if small pool b then lowers it's fees to attract more hash rate? We're back at square 1,but with bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 07:22:04
That's not really the same though is it? A common argument is that 'classic doesn't have an active enough dev team' - if there is a PR written already core could release both versions (as being from the same team at the same time), and let the market decide on that single change. You don't run a controlled test by changing many variables at once...
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:05:49
no. you're not getting it because it sounds like you're thinking in absolutes.
SOME hard forks may bring greater profits than others. SOME hard forks may bring greater profits than a soft fork. SOME soft forks may be more profitable than hard forks. SOME soft forks may bring greater profits than others.
No one should have a rule to ban all soft forks or all hard forks. They should be taken individually on their own merits.
Alternatively - i'm sure some of these would lead to higher profits.
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:23:01
Did you? I didn't say it helped decentralisation. I meant the effect of the relay network negates some of the effects of big block centralisation (to inside the gfc). No idea about the 'private'  network (not sure if it's alpha or private) but the relay network is open to all. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:57:47
This is the best answer. There's no need for you to take bitcoin for one transaction. You'll lose 5% or so just getting it back out to usd. If you want to get on the train then take the BTC, and strap in.. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:28:26
no, its saying it has zero confirms therefore not confirmed. It is currently unconfirmed. It does not have 1 confirmation, or any number above 1. It exists in the mempool, but as yet, not a block. 
Lets try this - I have zero apples in my hand, I call that "zero-apple" status. I'm not saying I have an apple in my hand, at no point does that infer I have an apple in my hand. Just like zero conf doesnt say it is confirmed.
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:44:19
Having drawbacks or potential issues doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What you mean is you think it no one should accept a transaction with Zero-conf, not that it doesn't exist (because it clearly does) 
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:46:38
If they were using a regular bitcoin client to mine. But they aren't. They're using the relay network, and also a new private network that removes the problem of block propagation. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 20:11:28
Which bit didn't give you that impression? 
@_date: 2016-06-06 21:48:40
*sigh* you're being deliberately awkward. I'll just try one more time.
scenario 1 : You go into a restaurant. You shout your order into the air. You're not entirely sure whats happening, but you wait 30 minutes, and it arrives.
Scenario 2 : You go into a restaurant. You tell the waitress your order, and she recounts it back to you. You comfortably sit and chat with a friend. You wait 30 minutes, and it arrives.
Scenario 3 : You go into a restaurant. You shout your order into the air. There's a computer screen hidden at the back of the room that you know about from experience, it shows your order. You comfortably sit and chat with a friend. You wait 30 minutes, and it arrives.
Scenario 2 is what would be described as "user feedback" in this case, and is very much preferable to scenario 1 and Scenario 3 - the advanced user knows where to look for his transaction (some sort of block explorer) - but not everyone does.
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:55:42
I can't give you all the technical detail (but it's not headers only as far as I'm aware). I'm simply talking about one issue. 
Larger blocks take longer to propagate. This centralises towards one side of the GFC (guess which). Smaller blocks = less of this issue. Relay / xthin makes blocks smaller. 
There may well be other issues at play,  But that's usually the reason given behind 'big blocks cause centralisation' - maybe you were asking a loaded question and you can tell me what you think...
@_date: 2017-01-02 07:50:52

@_date: 2016-06-21 17:54:27
If I'm reading this correctly, it's real but uncommon. One per day. One. 
Orphans would be down to the miner to control. Too large blocks increasing your orphan risk? Soft limit them a bit smaller. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 11:51:10
Routing can be done now, but it's the first version. Not scalable (every channel is broadcast and known to all so you can figure out a route 'reasonably'  easily)

@_date: 2017-01-23 09:53:34
I'm neither that dumb or a troll...im just calling you out on one specific word.  
I'm not disagreeing with you that if you add on on some fee analysis the information would be better. But you specifically said the OP was 'misleading', and still haven't answered why. Youve said meaningless, useless (maybe to you, fine) - but not why it's misleading. 


That's nice. This statistic would then say 100% full blocks. Which they would be. (although in reality, default minimum relay fees would stop you) 
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:20:47
It's just happened. No one died.the system continues to work (for everyone). 
What's wrong with a HF? 
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:09:32
That is already the case though. There are a few big pools. Their size is self regulated (see ghash.io). If centralisation of mining pools is indeed a problem, it needs a direct solution. But I see no evidence of that so far?
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:22:18
Won't you be exposing when you split them though? 
@_date: 2017-01-23 08:50:55
But it's not about fees..It's about the size of blocks. 
It may not be as interesting *to you*, it may not have as much use *to you* as fee distribution stats, but that doesn't mean it's not interesting or useful to someone else. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:58:57
Didn't you moan about semantics trolls in a post yesterday? Zero. Un. No. I don't care what you prefix it with, they are the same. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:45:19
The devs have said there isn't much chance of that. fees will be so low because its a race to the bottom - theres no barrier to entry for a node.
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:54:34
What do you mean invest? There's no money to be made from running a lightning node.. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:03:18
Well, they matter, but not for the purpose of releasing transaction capacity. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:05:08
What's misleading about this? If you want fee information, this isn't it. This is about blocksize... 
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:59:06
I'm not sure it's immoral either. There was an upcoming potential rollback, leaving exchanges out of pocket. No one was bribed into halting trading, it was done to protect themselves. Free market at work. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:46:19
Do you know I don't write software? Nope. But you've made some very specific claims (which are untrue). Seems as though you're not thinking logically at all. 
Also, Really great answers to my points.  Thanks. You've Really got me there. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:06:10
Sure, how about a Malleability fix. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 11:48:53
That isn't fully correct. Segwit is just some code in bitcoin core that stops transaction malleability (in part). It's not a person or service
The rest is reasonably correct. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:42:58
Sorry.. I'm lost. Are you saying a majority fork is an attack? You're so far into the echo chamber, i feel bad about it. The incentives bitcoin is built on stop actual attacks. A POW change would do nothing but decrease security. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:13:52
It was a facetious question, but thanks for clarifying with the parent! 
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:43:40
That's why the general public should have absolutely no part to play in things they don't understand (politics, technical issues) 
Unfortunately, bitcoin has no 'fix it in the mix' - you make a poor design choice, it's there for all time. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:11:33

@_date: 2016-11-28 14:38:01

@_date: 2017-01-09 08:39:17
Can you describe how more profit for all involved actors leads to less censorship resistance? 
For instance. More miner profit = more miners. Spread geographically. Higher censorship resistance. 
Bigger blocks = more users = more nodes = higher censorship resistance.

@_date: 2017-01-02 21:05:13
I'm not sure why you're beating this drum so hard, but I haven't said anything is HF specific or that you cant do something in a softfork - you've forced the conversation down that path. My original point was HF and SF are appropriate at different times depending on the change, you shouldn't rule one or the other out.
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:34:19
I guess the first question is what are you using bitcoin for? 
You may be better off with a thin client wallet not a full node (like core) if you don't need to fully validate every tx back to the genesis block.
@_date: 2016-11-16 12:39:12
Still nothing.
Unless they also operate a lightning node. Then there is some possibility to get routing fees or for other services rendered (monitoring etc). But how that works in practice is vague. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:02:17
Wouldn't that encourage people to go ahead if a major fork is deemed a non event? 
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:58:52
New nodes have to get that data from someone/where to validate back to the genesis block. If everyone prunes, that is no longer possible (in the current system) 
@_date: 2016-11-19 08:37:42
Supports segwit but also supports and promotes altcoin use. rule meltdown. Let's see what is most important to them..

Sounds cool . more detail please! Is there a video of the presentation, or transcript? 
@_date: 2016-11-28 16:35:56
Well, not with a pure vote, but by for instance, holding back large blocks for a period of time. That's a very real cost for the miner (orphan risk) - artificially bloating blocks wouldn't be a good idea. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 06:27:03
What for? 
@_date: 2016-11-18 07:49:03
OK,ill bite. Want to explain while carefully including the 'only segwit' part? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 08:01:42
Nodes don't matter. It's wallet support that does, that's where the transactions are generated. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:27:54
The same would happen in bitcoin,explicitly because core is the reference client. The protocol spec is the code, bugs and all. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:11:01
Nope, clearly you don't understand BUIP001.
Its designed to converge competing forks around blocksize - just like bitcoin does now with competing propogating block forks, but with additional user set parameters around the acceptable size.

Kotler outlined four levels of competition, based on the degree of product substitutability.
1. Brand competition.
Companies that are offering similar products and services at similar prices.
2. Industry competition
Companies offering the same class of products.
3. Form competition
Companies offering a product to serve the same need.
4. Generic competition
All companies that are competing for the customers' dollars.

This bit isn't quite right, sorry - It goes genesis-&gt;new and also fuzzed wallet age-&gt;new (the 2nd one is obviously quicker unless you're satoshi)


It speeds up the time to be able to use the software - yes, there is a trade off - you have slightly limited security at that point, but its a one time tradeoff.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:22:07
Absolutely. But it achieves the same as a soft fork (pretty much) in that there is only one viable chain,which appears to be your main issue?

And what do you think it means in this context?
@_date: 2016-12-04 12:39:26
It's also almost as close to DOUBLE 17%. Especially when you take into account the internal improvements,its way above double what is proposed. It also doesn't take into account actual usage. 
A fixed % is not appropriate at all times, that's a problem. It might be a line of best fit for some rough statistics of a few different datapoints but that doesn't make it automatically suitable for the real world, or take anything else into account. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 07:46:34
OK, that's easy, if we're just making up hypothetical situations that might happen.

If 100% are lightning transactions, I guess there's no upside,so yes - Why bother running a node in that scenario? 
maybe to run a lightning node and get the fees you must run a full node as well - I don't know. like i said, it's all very vague. 
I don't believe bitcoin needs many thousands of full nodes anyway. It needs nodes to service thin clients + nodes to maintain censorship difficulty  + nodes that for some reason must validate their own transactions + margin and no more. 
What are your thoughts? I'm not sure why you're asking me questions leading down a specific route (re lightning) - can you explain? 
@_date: 2016-11-19 08:55:58
It would either be delayed or lost, yes. I suspect that it wouldn't be lost (you would keep relaying the transaction until it got it) and I dont think they'd scrimp on fees either, so it shouldn't be delayed much by lower paying spam. 
It's either in there now or it didn't happen. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:23:05

Firstly, Grow up. This is a place for adults.


It wont help FULL sync, obviously. But it does help get new nodes up and running quicker, thats what we're discussing - adult comprehension needed.
But, seeing as you've mentioned it - about your points
1) Stating the obvious.
2) You can limit it using hashing limits, or miners wont include those large transactions if they think it will hinder their propogation / validation time. Or you can hard fork that issue away. or you can use segwit.
I fail to see a material effect on decentralisation unless you can prove it somehow....which you can't because you cant even define it.

Agreed - I think you cant have a 2nd layer without a functioning, still working as is first layer, and the 2nd layer should be completely opt-in.

Fine. I'll jump straight into the first BIP - 141.


Triggered when a scriptPubKey is a P2SH script, and the BIP16 redeemScript pushed in the scriptSig is exactly a push of a version byte plus a push of a witness program. The scriptSig must be exactly a push of the BIP16 redeemScript or validation fails. ("P2SH witness program")
Why two? why not just a native segwit address or transaction type? Thats a technical debt that has to be carried forwards.


 As a soft fork, older software will continue to operate without modification.  Non-upgraded nodes, however, will not see nor validate the witness data and will consider all witness programs as anyone-can-spend scripts (except a few edge cases in version 0 witness programs which are provably unspendable with original script semantics). Wallets should always be wary of anyone-can-spend scripts and treat them with suspicion. Non-upgraded nodes are strongly encouraged to upgrade in order to take advantage of the new features.
 


-Witness programs are hashed to 256 bit "redeemscripts" which are then hashed to 160 bit P2SH. This format is fully compatible with currently existing wallets that support P2SH. Upgraded wallets will be able to send and receive to and from older wallets without any problems.
technical debt, splitting the network into "can verify" and "cant verify".


A hardfork can take the opportunity to clean OTHER technical debt as well (for instance, other repurposed fields), which you appear to be ignoring.


Doesn't exist. See  (maybe you missed the update at the bottom) - *Don't trust. Verify.*




You literally quoted the part where I said it didn't destroy old coins.




Great. thats irrelevant because again you've ignored the bit where I said HF segwit wasn't the requirement. A HF malleability fix is the requirement.
You seem like someone who is intelligent, and has a decent grasp on bitcoin and its workings (better than mine), so I don't see how you cant see that these things wouldn't exist without a soft fork requirement being the driver of the solution to malleability.
I have no issues to raise with the actual code in segwit - i'm sure its very well written and tested. Its the delivery method driving the solution that I have an issue with.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:47:48

3 immediate reasons you're wrong, and probably many more given a small amount of logical thought.

3) 1 client encourages centralized control and group think. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 07:25:46
Not sure what you mean. Fees are a product of the limited blocksize vs demand / fee market / built into wallets,not miner choice. 
Any single miner will not raise the blocksize unless there is sufficient tx volume to keep total fee volume the same or greater (or shouldnt) - so it seems unlikely that us will mean a return to near free transactions (at least short / medium term) - once you start earning something, it's difficult to just give it up. You don't want what you've never known, etc etc
Any single miner also wouldn't raise the floor price when supply is over demand because they leave money on the table. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 08:38:02
Of course.  All miners optimize their own block. And that optimum point is where demand is greater than supply, not the other way around,i expect.

They won't, because the transactions are invalid on BCC - there's full replay protection. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 13:50:34
There's definitely potential for the 1st point about miners to be correct. Sounds like it's happening mostly unrelated to blocksize unless we're talking massive blocks right now, which we aren't. 
However, the more space doesn't equal more users is rubbish as you Rightly say. I'm not going to magically start using it more if there is a larger blocksize. But new users could. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 07:23:32
Yes. It's an upgrade. But they are not compatible with each other. There is no 'soft forking' it in. See Wikipedia.

It Has Been Proven several times. You just don't like the alternatives. 
1 -  flexible transactions
2 -  BUIP hard fork segwit proposal
3 - common sense logic.  wrapping a soft fork in a soft fork, then later wondering how a new segwit address will work,  must be more complicated code than 1 single new transaction type which is backwards compatible with old utxos (which the above are). You can't remove the old type with segwit as it relies on it. You probably could with the other two. Technical debt builds up with segwit. 
It's not a lie. It is potentially an opinion, I'll give you that. But neither of us can prove it either way, so opinions will have to do.

**I think you misunderstand me. I don't care about segwit VS flextrans, or core vs classic.** I'm not specifically advocating for flextrans, or expecting it to go mainnet right this second (however, it does seem like an interesting concept). If the **features** of segwit came as a ground up HF - i'd be happy running it. (except maybe the new blockweight calculation part - I don't see that as a necessary piece, and it woudln't be with a HF - you'd just increase the blocksize, maybe set a quick limit on sigops in the legacy transactions)
I'm using flextrans as a talking point, because it appears to have solved the issues that segwit was trying to in a completely different way. It may not be as tested yet, but that could happen. It may have undiscovered bugs, but they could be discovered. Segwit went through MANY code review and fix stages over 12/18 months. Flextrans is just at the start of that process (but seems to be an uphill struggle, because politics)
Anyway..lets go back to the post: 


Anytime soon, but maybe sometime? so we need to support both types when that happens. technical debt building up there...Why not start the right way? (answer : because hard forks are "evil" and ruled out from the start)


source please? BIP 141 says it'll be easier to roll out this way, nothing about larger changes. Flex trans seems to have been able to pull off a malleability fix without this spooky FUD excuse of "breaking consensus critical code" (if your code cant be touched by your best devs for fear of breaking it,there's something wrong with it in the first place...)


This doesn't appear to be correct. You keep ignoring the fact **Flexible transactions supports moving old coins using a new transaction type, with no malleability.**. This allows complete removal of creation of new transactions under the old type. You keep the parsing code, just segregate it from the main code, and don't actively update it unless absolutely necessary. This clears the technical debt for new developers to get upto speed. They can go into it if necessary, but don't have to.
I'm not sure what your experience is, but if you haven't thought that through, then maybe you're not on the right side of this conversation after all, unless you can give me some actual reason its not right, except "OMG DESTROYING COINZ" FUD


**Dont trust. Verify** You seem to just be taking old quotes and expecting them to still be accurate.


yes,but I believe its feature complete now, so looking forward to you listing those TODOs like you had me list some technical debt.


Dont trust. Verify. That wasn't "segwit" as it is now. The question is ALWAYS answered literally (as you've already parroted back the difference between HF SW and SF SW) - a HF segwit is not the requirement. segwit was built ground up as a softfork, so a ground up hardfork malleability fix will be different. At least you didn't say 100 devs though, congrats!


so? Its not his design,product or even protocol level. Its not finished. Id say that there aren't many people that do understand it at this point. However : 


nsequence and all BIPS that lightning require are fully integrated into flextrans. You're trusting old information, and haven't verified for yourself.


Trusting old information. Fixed quickly. Please verify.




Don't trust. Verify. See classic develop branch for a working implementation.

And so has flexible transactions..
Note the caveat around deployment. I realize hard forks are a different type of complexity. A one time type though. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:11:00
Because you literally just said 'if anyone should oppose hard forks, it's miners!' - which lumps all Hardforks in with a hardfork to change POW. Which is absolutely untrue. 
For instance, a hardfork malleability fix would be fairly uncontroversial to miners. Why would they be against that? A hard fork POW change would be controversial for them.

@_date: 2016-12-02 19:21:42
(borderline) Autistic core developers have told you that. It is Correct if the question is interpreted absolutely literally. segwit as a hard fork is  'a change of the Merkle root location' - but That's not the actual requirement. 
A hard fork malleability fix (not segwit) as a hard fork is simpler,code wise.
Granted,  Deployment, not so much. But not insurmountable.
@_date: 2016-12-06 08:41:41
At some point (and it has been mentioned before by the devs) it would make sense to track any non trivial forks (or all forks?)  if you have the need to do so. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 15:24:33


In what way? Fixes exist - they're not quite ready, but engineers have engineered and will continue to do so.


because segwit removes the quadratic scaling problem for segwit transactions. Engineers have engineered again! imagine that!


Thats not how it works...YOU brought it up, YOU think there is an issue.

No one is suggesting getting rid of old transactions/blocks. But they could be phased out eventually. That's not the point. 
Again, you're assuming the hard fork would be 'segwit' the package of moving the witness, script versioning, fee changes, blocksize calculation changes (and more)? I'm not suggesting that either.

What does segwit do in this context? 
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:59:08
Common sense? A soft fork inside a soft fork holding other potential soft forks cannot be simpler than a separate piece of code. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 09:02:46
All major things can be fixed as a hard fork too
@_date: 2016-11-22 19:42:32
Language barrier? Traced could mean "visible next week" or "viewable by a third party for escrow purposes"
@_date: 2016-11-23 12:25:39
I read the image, yes. It states that core will never hard fork. but I see its in the roadmap, so one of them must be wrong.
@_date: 2016-11-20 08:32:47
I guess it wouldn't be eligible now, it's already been made. 
No grant terms have been released, but maybe future work could be funded. I expect it will be paid on the basis of new features or r+d. 
@_date: 2016-11-05 08:29:01
Not sure on theoretically, but practically for current use, it's 1mb + 70% segwit + 20% shnoor = 2.04mb effective size
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:51:56
**mic drop**
Good spot ;-)

Cool "facts", bro. Well argued. An excellent discussion. 10/10.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:23:05
If a hard fork is not a lot simpler, they're either equal or a soft fork is simpler...whixh one is it? 
@_date: 2016-11-29 07:36:23
Bad example which proves my point, not yours... Ipv6 is essentially a large block altcoin, running in parallel - they are not interoperable in any way (at protocol level).  The market is slowly but surely transitioning over to ipv6 because ipv4 isn't flexible enough to suit changing needs.

It's almost as if it's EASY to upgrade the network, given features that are wanted by those upgrading...
@_date: 2016-11-23 11:42:21
It doesn't depend on segwit at all. It's just maths. Having segwit is a handy soft fork method that can be used to deliver it.

Do you really think cpu speeds *haven't* increased in THIRTEEN years?

How much did internal efficiencies boost processing speed? Libsecp was what, 5x Better?

@_date: 2016-11-16 11:20:50
So that's nearly 10% false signalling? When BU / Classic did this on the TESTNET, there was outrage.
Where's that outrage now? This is incredibly dangerous behaviour in production.
@_date: 2016-11-18 07:42:53
I understand that segwit is a way to get script versioning. But it's not the only possible way. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:49:07
I see. Thanks, but like I said, not all of those are future proof. Not sure any are,or they'd maybe have been adopted. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 09:42:18
Why do you not have a record *somewhere* of when/how you gave them away? Either on chain, or whatever changetip like service should have something you can use? 
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:48:08
I haven't said segwit is bad so don't really have to prove it. However, I do think fitting a soft fork inside a soft fork to allow further soft forks doesn't make sense long term and there must be a cleaner way to do it (quick analogy - fitting a square peg into a round hole or making a new hole and/or peg) 
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:24:52
Already answered the same question elsewhere. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 13:42:18
The Date doesn't matter. The Accuracy does. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 09:37:10
Of course it will. Within the confines of the 100tx limit, it will work fine. Maybe they could add in some additional fees to ensure you get in. After that, maybe they'll change what type of transactions they accept, that 100 limit might be a bit higher. But they'll be charging more fees all the time so people will probably use it less eventually. 
We'll see. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 20:48:10
Not at all..i can write complicated code to do the same thing as simple code. And vice versa. Technical debt doesn't have to be just removing features. Its refactoring code. Stopping repurposing fixed fields under certain circumstances, etc. 
A new transaction type *could* eventually remove the ability to make old style transactions (time locked transactions, blah blah yes I know) . A soft fork never can because it relies on the old type. 
There's nothing wrong with soft forks per se. But knowing when it's appropriate to use them is important. This is not a tightening of existing rules.
@_date: 2016-11-14 07:42:48
There's the Cornell paper (recommending 4mb Max, but it's a bit outdated now) and also Tom Zander has written some great blogs.

@_date: 2016-12-15 08:22:52
If you're trying to advertise segwit, the fact that an attacker could make a completely useless 3.6mb block is not a good thing.

Everything is vaporware until it's not.

Sorry - who was Bitcoin's creator again?
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:33:04
It's reversible because they don't pay merchant immediately, and they can net off the balance of future earnings. Or they take fees to cover it. That can be built over bitcoin (but I'm not too sure why) 
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:21:31
Or schnoor sigs. The idea is unfinished, let alone the implementation. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:49:57
I'll just repeat the question.


@_date: 2016-12-02 20:45:12
Three fixed overflows. Big deal. It's the start of an implementation. Why not jump in with some code review? Tom has added the latest BIPS to flextrans that you previously  said he was leaving out to stop lightning,surely it's worth another look as an idea if not full implementation. 
Segwit had many bugs, it took over a year of code review to be released, Which is fine. These things in general *are* inherently complicated. Relatively there are differences. 
But let's not pretend segwit is the *only* way to achieve a given solution. It's absolutely OK that other things exist. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:29:15
This is absolutely the key point. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:28:43
Sorry you guys get a bad rep in here. People be crazy sometimes. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 18:42:27

@_date: 2016-12-10 15:34:56
Reading that exchange, you absolutely didn't tear anything apart. If anything, you probably lost the argument.
People can verify to a point. For instance, I'm an average programmer but not a cryptographer. I'd HAVE to trust an opinion on that subject (preferably multiple,from an unbiased source) . If you think otherwise, you're not living in the real world, and frankly, your bias is clouding your judgment. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 12:45:08
There's a script versioning built right into bitcoin already..No need to force a softfork ontop of a softforked softfork (shnoor in segwit in p2sh)
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:35:10
Basically, The soft fork part of it kills the minority chain by making the old block version invalid - no blocks can be created
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:45:06
I think With the new system of measuring over a larger number of blocks, this isn't correct. Any variability will be averaged out
@_date: 2016-11-13 12:25:31
It's not that they can't for most people (maybe it's a bit complicated. Or they have bandwidth caps) ,its just they don't need to. Thin clients are perfectly acceptable for most peoples needs.

@_date: 2016-12-11 09:31:13
You've been drinking to kool-aid for too long to think logically, solely because you brought up the next point. This will be my last reply, thanks for your time. 
Yes. If you wanted to do 'segwit'  as a hard fork you could move the Merkle tree root. But that's not the requirement. The requirement is a malleability fix. 
Apologies if you can't follow my replies. I'm on mobile, so it's difficult to quote properly. 
The bit about technical debt is always relevant. If you don't understand that then there's no point in talking about this. 
No one is suggesting destroying coins. In fact, flexible transaction works with the existing utxo set!(and lightning - your favorite sequence numbers are in there).  Even if flexible transactions isn't what you want, it's an example of a cleaner malleability fix. There's also the hard fork segwit proposal - which is just a proposal now (not sure if there's any code yet) but it aims to be a middle ground between segwit and flextrans.
Thats 2 examples of a cleaner implementation. 
Yes. Deployment would be more difficult. But I'm not worried about that. It can and would be done. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:33:27
Some of those fit the criteria. Some dont.whats your point? 
@_date: 2016-11-23 11:39:28
Well once core finally hard forks (it's in the road map... Right? It may not be now, it may be 5 years down the line if bitcoin still exists in any meaningful form), I'll be happy to see the back of these types of people.
@_date: 2016-11-19 11:49:33

@_date: 2016-12-02 07:39:23
That's why the days of 'increase a constant'  are over. Blocksize needs to be solved in a future proof way. 1 hard fork. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:58:28
If B is inside A (segwit) you can't ever get rid of A. If A and B are separate (hard fork) you can most likely get rid of A eventually. 
Honestly, it's common sense. If you ignore all the politics, the labels, etc surely as a concept, the above makes sense?
@_date: 2016-11-17 20:49:47

You : "Do you people realize what the downvote system is for? It's for spam and off topic stuff. "
Me : "Your reply was off topic to our discussion. "
You : "HOW DARE YOU DOWNVOTE ME USING MY OWN RULES FOR WHY TO DOWNVOTE SOMEONE"
Does this make sense? It does not.
Tell you what - would you like me to cancel that downvote, and apply one to all the replies where you complain about downvotes? because they're certainly off topic.
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:54:06
Can anyone give me a rundown on the final license details, and why everyone is leaving? 
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:23:14
Wouldn't that make it easier though? Instead of brute forcing each letter, you'd just get a dictionary list and brute force those word combinations.
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:18:33
Off topic and disagreeing - The two are not mutually exclusive.
Now im thinking it would be *REALLY* funny to go down vote everything you've said for being off topic.
Let it go, it's ONE downvote.
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:21:59
ahh, yes - 2 words made up changes what i'm thinking, as they wouldn't be in the dictionary list, then you would have to go down to character level.
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:20:21
Yeah - I agree with that would be better. I was specifically referring to the XKCD comic - should have made that clearer
@_date: 2015-08-30 10:49:02
I don't see this being a production release..its a working release, but clearly not production ready, as it runs from a ruby command line.

@_date: 2015-08-30 16:38:42
I absolutely agree with that one - but my question is why it is not easier to brute force words, not remember letters/words.
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:30:03
*Wow...* I'm not sure I need to explain myself here, but I will.
I've downvoted you once out of 3 replies, for your last one, because it WAS off topic to our "discussion". You made up stuff that I didn't say, and it wasn't a relevant reply.
Neither was your third (complaining about a downvote? definitely not on topic) - but we'll let that slide because you seem annoyed about it.
@_date: 2015-08-30 14:01:44
The i stand corrected, and that's kinda weird...
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:57:49
aha, yeah, that makes sense. I had underestimated the number of words in a dictionary file as well :) thanks!
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:24:29
not really - there would be no value in it, because no one uses it. Its like making a new alt coin, now, and then expecting it to be worth the same as bitcoin. It wouldn't be.
@_date: 2015-08-15 11:19:38
I'm kinda impressed.
did you scan the entire unspent output list? how big is that?
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:07:10
I did. It looks like it's adding up the letters though, which is the bit I dont get, its just 4 words, not 25 individual characters. Im not being contrary, I just dont really understand how the the maths is calculated.
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:05:06
95^25 is greater than 10000^4 ("correct horse battery staple")
Or am I completely mathing wrong?
@_date: 2015-07-19 09:04:41
No. The transaction confirms when someone finds a block. It may or may not be you
@_date: 2015-07-12 10:49:30
I think this is one of the competing strategies for handling the blockssize issue. Can't remember who's it is though. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:32:00
OH. I'm an idiot. Yes. 
I was comparing the 25 letters in 4 words to 4 words, when the comic is suggesting 8ish letters against 4 words.
I get it now. hah. i'm a dumbass.
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:10:04
No one said that it would fail - but there would certainly be a period where is has no/little value / traction, which means the miners would be making little/no money, when they could be mining bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:58:04
Traffic isn't the issue for China (that happens over 10 minutes).  It's peak bandwidth (happens over 30 seconds). 
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:43:31
No. This will never happen under any of the possible outcomes. At no point during a fork will you lose any BTC, if you just sit tight and ride a fork out. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 23:55:43
But I only buy a coffee once every few weeks... I'd rather pay a few cents on top than tie up 100 for two months (or more in this case) - what about that there are 3 coffee shops outside my work? 2 supermarkets. A few bars. That's a lot of tied up cash... 
@_date: 2015-07-04 12:19:19
I understand the sentiment, but saying that way makes it seem like you're almost as biased as them...
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:05:37
Sounds pretty complicated, but if it works out better, great! What's be pros against something like XThinBlocks? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:27:00
Absolutely not now. It's a cesspit of politics, conspiracy theories and frankly, pathetic behaviour,and then the software is frustrating and the barriers to entry are still high. 
  They'd never even finish downloading the block chain, let alone meeting some random guy off localbitcoin and finding their first transaction hasn't confirmed for 12 hours.... 
@_date: 2016-02-28 11:40:44
You cant "abandon" the potential fork - the code is out there, and people can access it if they want

If you've got the time and inclination, sounds like you know your stuff, and could immediately jump in as a reviewer and add a large amount of value (if you don't already)
@_date: 2016-02-21 16:55:12
Definitely a good thing. Bitcoin (on reddit anyway) in general has become a cesspit of X vs Y, conspiracy theories and generally just sad, depressing behaviour which is a complete turn off.
I'm still here (and have no particular allegiance)..but new people coming in, probably a lot more fickle.

@_date: 2016-02-26 22:32:01
So what you're saying is there is currently no bottleneck with block propagation, because miners use the relay network? Remind me again why we absolutely can't have a block size increase? 
@_date: 2016-02-22 06:38:10
Oh. So it's not a one to one channel, it's payment to any merchant, like a prepaid visa debit card?
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:08:27
No bias in that headline at all.... 
@_date: 2016-02-23 13:27:09
You mean regular people with normal use cases and mainstream needs? 
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:09:33
So what you're saying is that we CAN support a block size increase because the miners who "can't"  support it already have an off chainsolution? 
@_date: 2016-02-06 14:57:54
10/10.would visit. And it would be a really great real world example of segwit scaling (all seems very theoretical right now) 
@_date: 2016-02-07 16:08:23
I had not considered this,ive never heard it before. Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:11:16
I wouldn't say peanuts...block reward is going down to 12.5 soon. Assuming fees continue the way they are, it's 0.4btc / 1mb block, that's 3% revenue,and probably a lot more in net profit. (not taking into account orphan risk here though) 
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:42:38
Yes. But they're not uncompressed. Theyre compressed via the relay network (or thin blocks) 
@_date: 2016-02-28 09:31:10
I guess they're much easier to track when they're frequent posters on reddit tho.. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 08:46:11

@_date: 2016-02-11 13:37:23
On the contrary, it is literally the definition of consensus. It's not 100% agree, or 90,or 75,uts a generally accepted decision. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 10:52:04
That's not my point,i don't care if it's RN or TB. the point is, the blocksize increase is stopped because miners in China can't cope with 1+ mb blocks. But they're not using 1mb blocks,theyve already solved the propagation issue with RN. What remains to stop a blocksize increase? 
@_date: 2016-02-27 11:51:26
You're probably the man who will be able to answer this for me... 
Tests say that we can't increase block size, because Chinese miners can't propagate bigger blocks quick enough. OK. I see that. 
I didn't know the relay network existed. This appears to solve the problem of block propagation (all the big miners run it). If they can't propagate 30kb (or 4x 10x),then they've got little hope anyway.... 
What is the biggest blocker for larger blocks now? (technically, not politically) 
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:03:59
True. But we can't measure nodes with reliability. 
If the nodes don't follow the miners, the blocks would orphan and the fork never happens. No problem there.
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:48:56
Actually, that's not true at all. If it was 50/50 exactly it would be essentially luck based which one prevailed.

Not really, because there is no fork. There may never be a fork, so it's still bitcoin. If there is a fork, it will be because of the majority rule, then it's still bitcoin. 
When bitcoin changed its block size from 32mb to 1mb it didn't stop being bitcoin...

It's a software fork but until the block chain actually forks the consensus rules are the same. It may not happen (and probably wont)

In all seriousness, mining is HARD. You're unlikely to make money, if that is your goal, unless you're going at scale (which I assume not). If you're still interested, check out the antminer s9. I believe they're the best around.

The thing is, you've taught me absolutely nothing - because you have nothing to teach, you have nothing of substance - but you do have loads insults, and wrong assumptions (i'm not American for a start..) - congrats, you've added no value to anything, because you have no value to give!
I assume you're not going to prove me wrong and answer the question :




@_date: 2016-09-21 06:49:21
But that's a completely different scenario. Here you're simply spinning up a node with low/no barriers to entry and no product differentiation. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 20:52:55
Why would there be any of these of the current tx version number is 1 (from what I can see on the wiki) 
@_date: 2016-09-18 12:13:45


that does sound suspect, I cant think of any reason why that would be a good idea - However, if it's paying an appropriate fee, there is no downloading of "extra" data. If it's paying no/very small fee, it wont get relayed by nodes. If it's in the middle, its probably a mempool issue for nodes - if miners don't have this transaction, they will just make a block with the other transactions in. (if i'm understanding that bit right, there may be orphan considerations, but I don't think other miners would include a transaction like that either)








Now i'm confused. If it's no threat, then nothing you've written has any point.
@_date: 2016-09-24 10:00:31
Isn't this the point of flexible / tag based transactions? it can be added as a new tag if necessary.

You're essentially leveraging yourself massively, except you cant lose more than you put in (which you can with margin trading)
If you can afford the monthly payments on the loan, its not a *terrible* idea with rates being so low. Its not a good idea either though...

@_date: 2016-09-09 16:00:11


Maybe that's not the right term - i mean something like this :  - if your tx is in the weakblock, then it will go in the big block, so, faster confirms.


Incorrect, it actually increases security in the short term (and matches in the longer term) - 


How can it be *the same* security? The security of a confirmed bitcoin transaction is way higher than a non confirmed lightning transaction.
@_date: 2016-09-27 13:09:29
I also have thought this for a long time. But core have clung in so long to the 'no hard fork' narrative, and 95% consensus, I don't even know if it would ever activate. 
Looks like maybe 80 to 90% of nodes have upgraded since v11 (based in a visual check of bitnodes.21.co)

@_date: 2016-09-06 06:54:50
Youve gone on ('explained') about increasing orphan rates leads to massive centralisation. 
You haven't explained how the current orphan rate (less than one a day according to blockchain.info) has lead to the current centralisation level of less than 10 big pools. 
Orphans rate is only going to go down from here with compact blocks, fibre network, etc. Are you worrying too much about orphans here? Seems like you've a bit out of the loop. 
@_date: 2016-09-09 19:22:36
I didn't say 17 seconds was an appropriate period for bitcoin to use...just that slower &lt;&gt; less secure, its more secure in the 10 minutes where bitcoin isn't secured yet.
If the network orphan rate rises, isn't everyone at the same disadvantage, so no difference? (I'm not sure if thats true or not - just thinking out loud, if you have any thoughts, i'd be happy to hear them)
alternatively, why not 100 minute block time? in your mind, thats *much* more secure?




well yes, but if you're just making one transaction you may as well just use a standard bitcoin transaction. What you've done is committed your money to the lightning network, anything after that isn't secured via the blockchain.

why are we talking about 2mb blocks though? that's not even related to the discussion.
ADSL2+ theoretical max is 3.3mbits.
Is OP in Australia? They've got worse internet than 50 other countries.
"According to the report, the average broadband speed for Australia in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 8.2Mbps, putting it in the 48th spot (down from 46th) compared to the rest of the world.
In terms of average peak internet speeds, at 39.3Mbps, Australia fared far worse, plummeting to 60th position (down from 46th) in the quarter."
Ignoring the "it can / it cant" nitpicking, my main point is that OP is effectively dragging down everyone else with "my connection cant handle x, so its unfair". 
When it comes to increasing fees, the answer is "tough, you pay more because that's what the network costs are, freeloader" - why is the answer not the same here? If OP has a genuine need to run a full node, that has a value attached, and upto that value should be spent on a server somewhere that does have enough bandwidth to cope.

@_date: 2016-09-11 07:08:57
What do you currently use bitcoin for? 
Do you have better connections available? 
Once you've got the initial download (about 4 days of 100% bandwidth use) your connection will be fine to keep up- with normal (possibly - with some tweaks), blocks only / xthin blocks / compact blocks modes. 
Alternatively, there's pruning mode where you only store / download the latest section (your choice on size) of the blockchain 
Edit : there's also bandwidth capping options you could look at in some clients (not sure core has this natively, but you could probably do it on your router)

I can't remember the full details now, but I think it's probably to do with that once it's included in the blockchain, it's unlikely to be reorged out, it gets deeper quicker, and eventually is the same security level
. Just look at the pretty graphs for the detail :-)

@_date: 2016-09-20 17:05:59
Well, there's the capital requirement.
 If you've got $100 in a node,  that will get easily tied up, and you won't be able to lend over that (assuming there's no clever/complicated splitting going on) - if you're a big bank/company, you can put $1million in and probably charge less as well.

Looking at the numbers on that site for 2mb blocks : 
Down: 0.107 mbps
Up: 0.747 mbps
Without knowing a bit more (op didn't mention his actual upload speed, or WHY he needs to run a full node), its hard to say exactly - but that would indeed be just about possible on most ADSL2 connections. ( - a few capping tweaks and then compact blocks, and you're well within limits if you REALLY wanted to - its probably not really something that you'd want to do, but that's not the point, the point is its possible, especially @ half the numbers you've provided - unless i've got something wrong in those numbers? (checked my units twice just to make sure I wasn't confused, but happy to hear otherwise)
Like I said in another comment, having an ADSL2 connection is pretty damn uncommon now, so op isn't exactly a typical (or even close to) user.

PS - I used statoshi.info to get ACTUAL stats for a node in my first post - what I didn't realise at the time was that ADSL2 was so slow on the upload, but going back and checking as above, its still possible to run a full node, even in *Australia*, on a home connection.

@_date: 2017-09-24 15:22:44
Lets stick to the facts here. We wont see 8mb blocks, so thats OK as well. current blocksize is dipping below 1mb due to having hit the current limit for so long. We might see it increase to about 4mb over time, but that depends on segwit getting a lot more adoption (5% at the minute - 
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:11:24
Happens often? not sure about that - interestingly, there have been 0 orphan blocks for 3 months..
Obviously you'd split to your own wallet, if it fails, then you try again. no loss of funds....
Right now, if you use bitcoin, you're not average - An "average" user wont even try to split their coins. They might leave it to an exchange (hell, i've been around for years, and I did that).
Yes, it might be complicated, yes there are risks. But the people at risk are traders / gamblers. Seems like you're over egging the issue to me.

Well, I'm not sure it's bad for bitcoin, but it's certainly inefficient. As an example : Its like the argument that x nodes on a vpn server is no more security or decentralized than 1 node on that server. Taken on a larger scale, how many nodes do we need to ensure decentralization? 100 spread across each continent? That would probably be enough to stop censorship from a government. Maybe 1000 in total spread acroas the globe? Anything more than enough to provide that security is kind of just a waste of bandwidth. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 15:35:11


Probably in the wrong sub for this, but the answer is : Because there is a self configurable soft limit underneath the "no limit", which is set by both miners and nodes for more decentralised control over the blocksize - the community works together to discover the consensus on the limit.

@_date: 2016-10-16 11:51:32
I think we're at the point where the devs don't really listen to the users at the bottom. They constantly think they are above a mere user. 
It's a lot more difficult for people at the bottom to get their opinion heard. 
There's a lot of reasons why, and no easy way to fix them. Your voting analogy is fairly apt - I know after brexit, someone said 'look what you've all done, I'm glad I didn't vote!' - my head almost exploded.

@_date: 2016-10-15 16:54:38
Well...you brought up blocksize, we were originally talking about trust models.. I haven't said anywhere about costs of full validation, so i'm not sure how I can lie about that.
It is well known is that the cost of full validation has been dropping dramatically internally via scaling enhancements like libsec, compact blocks, etc etc. it also drops externally via technology moving onwards and getting better.
**All i'm saying is we can safely offset that drop with an increase. and no one will be losing any trust model that they're using now**
I'm not arguing for 100mb blocks, or anything that would stop people validating completely if they want to. Just calculate the drop, calculate the increase, that can be net 0 if you really want to keep things the same.
@_date: 2016-10-11 11:30:27

@_date: 2016-10-15 10:28:56
A few issues : 
1) What system takes 11 minutes to verify an 8mb block? Is it 0.1%, 1%, 10% or 50% of nodes?
2) At what point in the future will the system generate an 8mb block? It certainly wont be in the coming months, even if there is a hardfork tomorrow. While building upto 8mb blocks slowly and safely, we can optimise that 11 minutes down - just like over the past year(s) transaction verification and block propogation have been optimised so 1mb is quite easy for the current network to handle.
@_date: 2016-10-16 10:14:54
That's exactly what top down is. The devs being the top, users/markets being the bottom
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:12:08
... And that's relevant how? 
@_date: 2016-10-15 13:35:47


And thats my choice - i'm distributing the trust out, i've done my risk assessment, and i'm comfortable with it. Why is SPV **impossible** again?


Everything is black and white in your eyes isn't it? "no choice" "impossible" etc...
The same model applies with a 0.5mb blocksize, a 1mb blocksize, or a 1.2mb blocksize. or a 2mb blocksize. or a 4mb blocksize. probably not a 100mb blocksize though *at this time*. Maybe in a few years though...who knows where development will take us? Maybe we'll never need 100mb blocks. Maybe we'll get upto 10mb and then something comes along and completely changes transaction use (Lightning v1, v2, mimblewimble sharding, flextrans etc), and we go back to 5mb. or 1mb. that's fantastic, as long as all valid transactions that are available in the system at the time can be processed safely and efficiently.

You could say that's a good thing. It'll clear down the utxo set. 
@_date: 2016-10-30 09:08:53
It is probably a factor to push down blocksizes somewhat (same as now, but I expect stronger)..but the fees available from transactions should push it back up. With a floatable blocksize, equilibrium then happens naturally.
It also does counteract the "miners will do anything to raise blocksize to infinity because fees" argument (which is wrong anyway, because fees go down to 0 in that case anyway)

Thats a little more than "No commits for x months = policy to revoke access".

Not really, no. That was a definite contentious fork. A version of Segwit as a hard fork malleability fix only seems like a sensible thing. Not sure why it would be controversial at all, except for being a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-10-15 14:02:31
Sure - lets move on :)
I'm not actually sure what you mean be "only do a change of a constant if it's absolutely needed (**like $1 fee**)"
Also - I cant reconcile "in favor of doing a significant change to the concept of the blockchain (braiding, tree-chains, etc.)" and "only do a change of a constant if it's absolutely needed" - how do you do the first without the second?

Your data is from 2015. Version 10.x of core. That's so far ago it's almost completely irrelevant...I'd like to see that data recollected on 13.x - I suspect it would prove your point that these incremental increases are being done, and my point that these efficiency gains have removed any immediate issue with a sensible blockchain increase. 
Tom Zander collected some node syncing results recently IIRC, and it was in the order of hours to sync, not weeks or months..
Off chain is fine, I've no problem with that. But, should we not be encouraging these massive amounts of companies to come on board? They're the ones that will find the solutions. Instead they're sitting on the sidelines.

If it's an orphan risk for miners, they won't make larger blocks. If the fees from larger blocks outweigh the orphan risk, they'll do it, therefore orphan risk is not an issue to sensibly raising the block size. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 16:07:14
Absolutely, but the reason given isn't a defined policy. It was singularly used against Gavin.
He may not contribute right now, or need commit access. But he did have it, and it should be his to give up, or a defined policy, not a knee jerk reaction (which was later incorrect). 
Give it back, create a policy and then remove again, fine.

I'm not sure that's entirely a 100% correct statement. However, "could not happen" can never be proved correct "probably wont happen" is more likely because : 
There are large differences between a blocksize increase and a fundamental immutability reversal. 
There are also differences between bitcoin and ethereum in handling difficulty drops (ETH makes it much easier for the minority coin to survive)


You can use that argument on the "small blocker" side - get control over development (actual or via leadership), get money via "Expert" power. Push people onto Layer2, get more easily funnelable money streams..

Well, that is their decision - this is just bitcoin as designed. longest chain is the consensus - nothing dictatorial about it - if the developer truely believes in bitcoin, they would continue developing. If not, it cements the view that they are in it for only their own gain/ideals.

@_date: 2016-10-23 15:41:40
Its interesting, because too many nodes is potentially unhealthy due to the replication of data that happens across all of them (see : creation of the lightning network to mitigate this). Also, logically, making a node as cheap as possible to run entails that the blocksize should be lowered, which is probably not a good idea.
There should be a balance between all these things factors. Unfortunately, its not really known where the balance lies, and no way to anticipate it up front.

Of course it lowers validation costs. You only need to validate your set of the chain. I'm assuming there would be a way to quickly validate the other shards (such as how mimblewimble does it). I don't think that the whole scheme is worked out yet, but it *could* work like that, which means your unequivocable statement is not correct.
I didn't mention those other things, we're talking about *total node costs*. But there would certainly be an effect, yes.

You're right, we've both heard it all before. All I can say now is...**prove it**. Show the world current data that you're right, and you can stop this entire drama right now.
I fully agree that it's all scaling. but it's scaling one thing (efficiency), making it safe to scale another (capacity) - but then not doing it, I just can't see the logic there.

Don't worry, they've thought of that too. Nodes and miners can set their 'acceptance depth'. Of they do happen to be on a minority fork like that, after x blocks it will accept the larger block and you'll go back to the majority fork.
@_date: 2016-10-15 17:10:24
**One time gain** from two separate things - libsecp256k1 and compact blocks? That's 2 times at least...so not wrong at all. Incremental increases happen in every single release, they're just the big ones. 
What exactly are you referring to with "one time gain"?
Progress is absolutely being made in efficiency. But not capacity. That is a fact - no judgement either way - you agree or disagree with that as a statement?

I believe it's just miners that must to upgrade to lock this in. 
Any node that does upgrade can generate a segwit tx.
If a node doesnt upgrade, they will still forward on segwit transactions, but not understand them.

I'm not handwaving - i'm not mentioning those things because we're talking about node costs, not how mimblewimble works. 
I mentioned mimblewimble as an example, not a concrete "this is what is happening" - I don't fully understand the protocol, but I do know it has some sort of proof beyond full chain validation - any limitations it has do not apply to my theoretical example of why your unequivocable statement was incorrect. 
I could give another example if you want?


Lets say there's a new transaction type which takes longer to validate - some new sig scheme that is smaller in size, but takes longer to validate in CPU terms. Next year, CPU speeds in general are faster, for about the same price as a current year one. It negates (and more) that extra CPU time by being faster overall.
Your absolute unequivocable statement is now incorrect.
edit - look, at this point, we're going around in circles. All i'm saying is you shouldn't use 100% absolute statements with "always" and "never" and "forever" because they're very unlikely to be true because external factors change which affect what you are talking about.

Let me summarize. I understand that changes made now make a difference into the future.

Ask lukeJR. Run a node, and they'll connect to you!

Changing the number of decimals will be just as hard if not harder than changing the blocksize. Every piece of software out there is hard coded to 8 decimals.

The only possible data reduction seems to be after receiving. You no longer need to keep the sigs after you've proved they're good - a bit like pruning but you can still keep the history. 
Not sure that's a good thing for the long term health of the network though...bootatrapping a new node gets harder. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:22:44
Equity is the residual interest left after liabilities have been paid. If they're under bankruptcy protection they cant afford all their liabilities,shareholder equity is not a liability (in this context), so the equity is eventually lost. Regular shareholders are at the bottom of the pile to get anything back. 
Unless you're talking some kind of bitcoin stock not real life,then anything goes...
@_date: 2016-10-29 21:04:14
Interesting... I thought they did look like standard transactions, and that was the point of doing it as a soft fork.

Wtf is this about? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:17:20
That's not exponential, that's double..? 
10 nodes @ 1 mb = 10mb
10 nodes @ 2 mb = 20mb
If you have a bandwidth cap, you cap your bitcoin client bandwidth usage via a target bandwidth or connecting to less nodes or using compact/thin blocks, or blocks only.
 If you don't have a cap, or have a higher cap, then you can indeed handle a little 2mb block. 
Remind me again how it's exponential and incredibly expensive, I'm still not seeing it.
@_date: 2017-07-22 07:44:26

Or, the same for companies that want a small block size. Everyone has an agenda. It could be 'help the unbanked' (large blocks, free transactions) or 'make my VC backers money' (small blocks, layer 2 solutions, high fees) or anything in between. 
Painting one side as massively worse than the other is wrong. There is good and bad on both sides. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:54:05

It's not correct at anytime. I was being facetious and missed the /s.

You've forgotten that the economic majority (exchanges, shops etc) need more than 1 block per day,so won't be on your chain. 
You might be able to spend between the few hundred actual nodes on your chain, but few legitimate businesses will be there.. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:23:21
Did you just decide that hardfork rule now? Because that's not a fact. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:14:47
You're forgetting that miners have to wait 100 blocks to sell the block reward. That's over 3 months with no revenue, and an uncertain future. 
By the end of day 1, bitcoin would be 144 blocks ahead. By the time a miner gets to sell any usaf coins, 14400.  There's no way to recover from that and wipe the legacy chain out. 
Bip148 coins are not risk less. The risk is they are worth nothing.

its not really that complicated to do...shoot me a PM, im sure we can work something out if you need a coder.
all you'd have to do is send out some small payments to whoever asked (obviously keeping either a database of takers, or ip addresses, phone numbers or emails etc to stop people getting multiple payments)
my question is - how would you fund it? BTC faucets are few and far between (that actually work), because the value of 1 BTC in USD is higher than it used to be.

there's some people on bitcointalk saying that often BTC-E will only list a coin if they can pre-mine / pre buy a large amount, to pump + dump when it is listed.
of course, there's a million conspiracy nuts on there.
all you have to do is look at the value of any of the smaller altcoins thought. down down down down.
they bring no value, they bring nothing new to the table, and are essentially worthless. litecoin MAY survive. the others probably wont in a meaningful way.

I think at the minute, that's probably the simple way of doing things, and probably almost acceptable if the values are low. But as the tax framework updates, that will definitely not be the case.  For instance, if I pay you 100 pounds worth of beans, you've still got a taxable income of 100, even though it's not GBP.

I'm sure bitbargain does work - like I said, the system looks fantastic. Its just the faster payments option which it relies isnt available on natwest at weekends (well, not to me anyway...i assume everyone is the same)
sounds like that seller may have an old price still listed..send an email, see if they reply. if its the right price, then as long as the seller shows you the secret code for your transaction, you're guaranteed to get the coins.
however...if they mug you and take your cash, thats another story...but im fairly certain the odds of that are very small... ;)
