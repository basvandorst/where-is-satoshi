I personally dont give a fcuk whats bitcoin value. Lots of ppl would be happy if bitcoin price stabilized, even if thats at 50$/coin. Lets hope get-rich-quick and other like minded people will leave bitcoin alone (and they are doing that right now, as we can clearly see).

Well, Greeks themselves took loans of useless paper (as you say) and traded it for new shiny cars, Prada bags, new railway system etc. So it looks totally reasonable they now do the same thing vice versa.

Powerhouse which cant issue new money and most of existing money is owned by people in shadows. Even if they bought all bitcoin trading now on public exchanges to fuel up their central bank, there would be tons of coins sleeping and waiting for a chance to destabilize whole economy.

How can this actually work? I guess i can just guess some whitelisted email and send emails with "from" set to that email anyway.

Thieves will just use their stolen coins to buy steam keys or paypal money or other valued virtual items from random dudes, leaving them holding the stolen coin bag. This is bad idea. Just protect your coins ppl.
