The price is not the most important thing.

You can do it with coinomi app : send funds(btc) to new adress. Import private key of the old adress( that contains btcgold and bch) in coinomi. Extract or trade(in coinomi you can use shapeshift to exchange for btc)
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:55:29
Check the dates. If you had btc in your wallet before these dates you own the forked coin.

Where do I download this vid? :)

Btc price going back up,I hope everyone bought the dip!
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:48:28
Yes i agree its all speculative since only bitfinex knows whats going on. We should deffinitely keep asking questions! Look if they are solvent and such. Just want to be carefull spreading rumors without proof.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:53:21
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:34:16
Buy now. This is the dip.

The hacker can't even spend the theters since the adress is flagged. Why does this affect bitcoin so much?
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:16:32
If the hacker was smart he put down a margin ahort right before the hack. Might be his whole reason for hacking theter
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:17:14
You should be good mate. Might be that you also can not send any funds if its not (fully) synced. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:50:16
It's dipping now..
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:20:14
The hack will probably be an even bigger reason for an audit
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:25:11
Kraken, bitfinex, bittrex, poloniex, OKcoin just to name a few..
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:04:07
Simply copy/paste those keys (they kinda look like btc adresses, sort of..) in electrum (import keys window)
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:27:59
I too have some questions about theter but i don't see how one of the biggest exchange would pump the price this way by risking the future of there existence. There is no good reason for them to do this. The btc price would go down. The exchange would stop existing etc. They would destroy themself.
The influx of new investment entities true OTC trades and the increase of the price of btc is in my opinion the best way to explain the increase in theters. 
Don't you think other exhanges have fact checked theters before even listing them? If it is really a bubble all of the big exchanges would have a problem. I can't see how most of the trading platforms would all be in on a big conspiracy and on a road to destroy themselves. Saying this is fud to me. And I dont think we ever get to see the records about theter since these are from private investors.

You can export your private keys from core and input them in a ew wallet. Core wallets dont have a seed

Download a new wallet. Replace the new wallet.dat with the old wallet.dat and wait till the blockchain is synced. When you want to send funds it will ask for your password.

Yeah meant seed words. Diddn't know it was the first private key, thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:04:33
Invest it all. Thank me later.

I like jaxx, has a nice UI. Put the wallet on a (encrypted)usb for extra security! And make a backup on a other usb.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:04:39
Get a xapo card! ( or similar type btc card )
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:56:22
Did the same traveling true Asia for 10 months. Only thing I regret is cashing out btc at such a low price..
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:50:20
Bitfinex lets you trade your future B2X coins @ +/- 15% of the btc price.

I have the same question regarding the core wallet, are my coins going to split if I keep them in there?
