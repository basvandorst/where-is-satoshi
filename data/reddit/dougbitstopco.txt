Andreas is the one that kicked me down the rabbit hole we call Bitcoin.  I figured why not?  He has never been shy about getting behind a charitable cause or posting weird stuff online :
Plus I wanted to challenge people that had the power to challenge other notables in the community.  Muhahaha

No Problem :).  It was fun and definitely felt great to do my part.  As someone whos family has been affected by this horrible disease Im just happy for the opportunity to raise awareness.

The one bitcoin is just something we decided to do.  In fact your supposed to either do the ice water bath or donate.  But many people do both.  Being so closely touched by ALS we decided we wanted to donate a whole bitcoin.

I understand your concern.  But the ALS Association doesn't just fund research.  They help the family's in need with all sorts of help. When something horrible like this strikes its typically unexpected and devastating. You would be surprised how something as simple as getting around from point a to b becomes a big endeavor and very costly.  Comprehensive support for both the patients and the families in need are just as important as a cure. 
No doubt in my mind non for profits are not perfect with their funds, but should that stop people from donating.  Hopefully technologies like Bitcoin will help increase the transparency of all charitable organizations.
I decided to get behind this because a couple of days ago most of my peers had no idea what ALS was.  Thanks to the ice bucket challenge that has changed.  That in itself is a success.
As for being late in the game I would have to disagree.  I think we are just in this middle of this giant social media equivalent of "The Wave".

Our fee is 10%. We charge based on the USD inserted into the machine and quote you the global bitcoin average.

This sign will be seen by over 400,000 travelers a year, most who are not bitcoiners. Hopefully, it will spark conversation between travelers while they wait for their flights.

Another option is to go with a lamassu and use takekontrol.co to manage your back end dashboard.

Yes it's new :).  Requires no permissions except access to the internet. Always smart to be cautious though.
