This could just as easily be an exploit of Intel vPro, which lets a remote user access a file system and vnc into a machine remotely. The vPro tech is specifically designed to do all of this stuff out of the box and it has scared the bejeezus out of me since I first learned about what it can do.

BTCC just mined another empty block, they're the real cancer here. Transactions with fees are valid and should be included in blocks based on their bid. I'm cool with that. When miners produce empty blocks, however, the protocol doesn't work.

Be careful, Coinbase tracks where coins go when you send them. If they don't like where the coins go they'll ban your account.

This. I'm already looking at FUDing a larger percentage of my holdings to ETH for stability, but if BCH ultimately overtakes BTC it's gonna have to do it without the goodwill of the BTC developers, the people who are buying BTC post-fork, the people who owned pre-fork and can't figure out why they can't access their BCH from the Core wallet, and the people on the sidelines of crypto trying to figure out what's going on.

This is a bunch of dumb money that bought last December selling on the advice of their accountants to lock in short term capital losses. This is an excellent opportunity.
