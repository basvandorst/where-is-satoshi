Supply literally means nothing, as market cap can adjust.
BTC has 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshi. Smaller units than satoshi can exist, too, with a simple fork/update.
Point is BTC and BCH are not both bitcoin because, and this is verifiable, most people never redeemed or immediately sold their BCH. Which means the BCH rich list is way worse off than BTC's rich list, and means that market manipulation is way more likely and possible. 
And there's the whole fact that BCH was not wanted by a majority of miners and users alike, but yet Roger touts it as the "real bitcoin" and that "core" is the impostor fork.
BCH is not bitcoin, it's a scam.
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:24:33
No, not just if you're trying to get out.
I agree you shouldn't sell it all if you want to stay in, because who knows where the bubble might pop... but I, for instance, sold almost all of my BTC at $9,000 when it hit that the first time after a constant year+ climb from ~$600.
Wouldn't you know it came back down significantly from 9k. Of course it went higher, too, and I could have made more.. but if I was strictly hodl, I'd have less BTC (and others) today.
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:31:18
By use, BCH is comparable to BTC in 2012.
By fees, BCH is more expensive than BTC in 2012.
So, not sure how you call that scaling or cheap or anything else.

a small number of.
The median numbers you gave were like 60KB. That's only a few KB to most people. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:06:50


A small but indefinite number. "few roses were still blooming", do you think that means only 2 or 3 roses literally?
"few women have led troops in battle" -- again, only 2 or 3, literally?
Maybe you're not a normal english speaker. A few can mean anything that's small.
KB are *already small*, and so anything less than 4 or 5 hundred could be considered "only a few KB" when talking about file storage.

So weak men sell at insanely high prices? Because in the graphic good times = high prices, and weak mean create hard times which seems to be low prices, so weak men sell and create hard times..

Except no, because bcash is shit.
Edit: "Why is bcash shit?"
Bcash is shit because it's an unwanted fork created by a small group of scam artists to get even richer. It doesn't have anything impressive over bitcoin, and its scaling "solution" has been criticized as giving up decentralization and security. 
Bitcoin is about consensus. That's what satoshi wrote in his paper. But bcash ignored consensus and forked in open rebellion to bitcoin. Since then, the money behind it has posted misleading things about bcash being the real bitcoin, etc.
If regulation were in this space, Roger would be going to jail for defrauding investors with his lies.
Check usage comparisons between bch and btc. BCH is used about as much as BTC was in 2012, but the fees for BCH are more than BTC in 2012, they are closer to BTC in 2017. So even by usage, BCH cost more in fees than BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:27:02
That seems like it would only create hard times for them, and not really everyone else. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:25:37
Defeated in logic? lol. 
So only a few roses still blooming means 2 or 3 roses?
So only a few cents a day to starving kids is like 2 or 3 cents?
The past year average is literally less than 60KB, and for BTC the past year average is like 800KB.
OMG GOOD THING YOU GUISE HAS BIGGER BLOCKS CAUSE THAT'S SCALING.
I think the defense is plenty coherent. If you want to ignore half of the real english uses of "few" then be my guest, but don't pretend like that's normal.

Average BCH fee is comparable to BTC in 2017, but average tx per day is comparable to BTC in 2012.
BTC in 2012 had *cheaper* fees than BCH's average.
There stress test yesterday was flooding thousands of transactions worth $0.0025, which of course have low fees. Real world usage is cheaper than BTC today, but it's also not anywhere close to BTC volume.

A vast majority of people have not touched it.
The barely computer literate people who were buying were doing so because BTC jumped from ~$600 to $19k in roughly 1 year.
So yes, at $5000, $10000, $15000, people were peak interest.
The same thing and more will happen at $50k, $75k, and so on.
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:51:34


Yes, this way BTC mining can become akin to farming in that you need a lot of land in specific resource-rich areas (in this case high-wind or solar)- and farmers can sell their goods (BTC) back to the people.
In no way does this sound like it would become monopolistic /s


Yeah, you know, except for the thugs with guns, protecting the millions of dollars worth of equipment.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:14:01










Actually 2017 is when I built my current computer and I had no problem buying a GPU on amazon and getting it in 2 days.
Yes, those companies were rushing their shipments of thousands of GPUs via plane- but they still had the same (minus bulk discount) price per unit and have the same electricity consumption as anyone else.
They rented planes so that it wouldn't take 3 months on a boat to show up.
That's a lot different than, "We're the only company in the world who has access to this new chipset we designed- let's mine with it until it's barely profitable and then sell it to schmucks."

Okay, but you realize SHA256 also had no ASICs originally and was also secretly ASIC mined.
Also I at no point said that GPU coins were a solve to the problem. 
POW is pointless long term. $10k in the best new miners will take 2 years for a ROI. Do people report the machines lasting longer than 2 years at constant use? Not often.

@_date: 2019-11-21 16:02:11
Yes, there are flaws with gpu mining as well, but at least everyone has equal access to the equipment- until we get to ASIC's.
You mention secret asic optimizations for gpu coins, but why would you believe for a second these don't exist for coins that already have ASICS?
In 2014 ASIC manufacturers were mining with their ASICs for months while they filled pre-orders, until the profitability was anything but a guarantee. 
Why would we not assume the same is true for any new ASIC optimization? Why would a manufacturing company sell equipment that prints money? 
And in no way am I saying that equal-miner-opportunity is a trivial problem to solve. Even POS consensus favors the already wealthy. There isn't really a feasible way to prevent class-divide in mining.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:35:42


Can you give some reasons why? ASIC is a class divider making it impossible for anyone who isn't already wealthy to have a positive endeavor mining BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:36:22
POW is a dead end.
What is the argument for consuming so much power to solve arbitrarily more and more difficult hashes? 
Does having insanely fast sha256 devices help with *anything* other than blockchain mining? The tech is only good for a single use-case, and it costs the world huge amounts of energy during a time when we are in a literal energy crisis with global warming.
In my opinion, what really needs to be solved is "Proof of identity", in a way that doesn't actually identify the person. Not sure if it will ever happen, but it will be the only good way to have "one person-one miner"

@_date: 2019-11-21 16:47:26
I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. sha256 was fragmented across a thousand coins in 2013. They all got attacked due to lack of ASIC resistance. BTC is secure because it's  in price and it's the common-sense place to point your otherwise useless sha256 miner. 
Eth is not more centralized than BTC, with more nodes online than BTC by far.
Back to the discussion though... what stops manufactures from taking advantage of "secret ASIC optimizations" ? 
It's been the case for quite some time that if you have $10k and want to invest in BTC, buying coins outright has a higher return than buying ASIC miners. 
It's also been the case for some time, that coins have found ways of being secure without terrahash sized networks.

Odd that you think pensions should only be in the public sector. Did you read the article?


Also this isn't a typical pension. His is high because he signed up for it in 1973 under different rules and then worked at the same place for 60 years. 


But I will say that there are those who abuse pensions. Mostly in the public sector, because the private sector would never let it happen in the same way.
Example: Throughout my school district growing up, we had a new principal and new superintendent every few years. The local newspaper reported on it, and it turns out that these people were working for a district for the minimum number of years to collect a pension, and then immediately leaving and starting at a new district, with the same goal. 
Some of them are retiring with 10 different pensions.

And what if my only response was, "The 1% in PoS hopefully..."
Also if ASIC innovation is near its end, how is your 1% going to be tech-heads and entrepreneurs vs old money?
The eventual end-game here is for some chip manufacturer (not some indie group, but intel, amd, and the like) to design the best ASICs, and for their biggest customers to be nation-states. 
PoS, while, again, I never suggested using it, is still in its infancy. Criticizing it's current implementation doesn't mean that it won't grow into something better.
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:44:48
No.. people still need to want to buy it. The issue is that miners won't be willing to sell it at a loss. Which makes available market supply lower. If you've ever passed by someone and overheard any conversation about economics ever in your life, you might understand that lower supply and an unchanged demand means higher price.

That's possible, sure. It's incredibly unlikely though, given that BTC is incredibly useful, and cannot simply be killed like a website. 
People have given value to bitcoin. They will be hard pressed to lose that value. Bitcoin will always have use cases. With 3rd gen blockchain, bitcoin will be inter-operable with other services. So even if bitcoin isn't the lead dog, it will still exist and have value. 
Someday it might become novelty only. I expect then for the price to be much higher than it is today.

@_date: 2019-08-23 05:20:07
Sure, but spending serious amounts of money on something so new and speculative isn't as easy as having a handful of sites you visit once a day to click a button. 
Obviously faucets were never the best way to make a ton of money, but that's not the point. They were viewed as a waste of time because you'd only get maybe 1 or 2 cents at a time, with a once a day or once an hour type limit.
Even at that rate though, a handful of faucets would have eventually returned thousands of dollars.

That being said, we can expect crypto (at least some of them) to do really well and for these prices to seem like (because they are) entry level prices.
The jump can happen in days, as we've seen time and time again.
If you are truly confident in your investment, selling at a loss is the worst thing you can do.

Hey you're the one that said the car, cell phone, and internet didn't try to replace anything and that bitcoin can't be compared to those.
All I said is that they all did replace things, and so it's just as possible for bitcoin to replace fiat in the ways that these techs replaced their predecessors.
I never said it was proof it was going to happen. Don't be an idiot.

Can you short a spot market with leverage? I think that's the big thing. People want to take a fiat, and bet it on bitcoin going down in price. They don't necessarily want the bitcoin, so waiting for the drop and then buying does not satisfy their needs, or provide them with a profit at the time of the dip, whereas shorting it does. They essentially sell btc they don't have, using fiat as collateral.
edit: even if they wanted BTC, if they knew a dip was incoming, shorting the market and using the profits to buy would result in a higher yield than just waiting for the dip.

I used to think faucets were a joke, but looking back, I probably could have made thousands more dollars if I had used them.
When BTC was $80, the idea of &gt;$10k was still just a dream.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:09:22


I'm confused though, if they sent you 10btc and they only liquidate $7k collateral, do you still owe close to $70k at current prices?
edit: nevermind, this isn't a loan that sends btc over a tx, but rather a loan only on that market.

Less than 5 years before that it sold for less than 1 cent.
The trend is upwards and always has been.

Oh don't worry, if I were going to beat myself up it would be for selling 11 BTC at $600, and 20 ETH at $12.
But also, faucets were giving out proportional to BTC's value, and some weren't too shabby. 
If someone had used 10 faucets a day for a year when BTC was $10-$100, they could easily end up with a few grand today. Not anything for anyone to beat themselves up over, it's just an observation.

It is supposedly backed 1 to 1 with USD, but it operates on the bitcoin blockchain.
You'll see it on many exchanges as USDT
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:09:08
Right. But since I'm not privy to the auditing of tether, I think it is fair to point out that over a third of their entire circulation has been created in the past month.
It's important, whether it is shady or not.

The funds nearly all go to the same address, which is labelled as Bitfinex on tether's official site:
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:08:03
I'm not trying to claim anything fishy about tether "propping up" BTC. There is enough fiat volume for this to be an impossible endeavor, if the demand didn't exist outside of tether.
Just odd that tether has printed $230 mil in new tokens and hasn't made any kind of announcements or anything else.

Well, no. You said that if bitcoin pre-segwit had value, then so does BCH.
As far as people thinking BCH is "good", they're mostly victims of propaganda. A smear campaign against bitcoin put on by Roger Ver, all for the sake of wanting to be a trillionaire. He's a greedy piece of shit and literally posts articles on bitcoin.com entitled, "Bitcoin cash IS Bitcoin"

Because their market cap has gone up 50% in the past month?
It seems like a big step up in adoption, and most companies would have some sort of news involved with that big of a jump

But it does raise the market cap of USDT- which is still important news.

No, Bitfinex. Their current funds are only 8.6 million, but they are the recipient address of nearly all of the new USDT generated this past month.
In the main link, the "granted tokens" are sent to Tether's reserve wallet, and from there to Bitfinex.

Why? Will you absolutely need the money in 6 months? If not, why sell at a loss?
It's almost a guarantee that it will go back above 18k if you just wait.
It could be $100k in 5 years. Then you'd be a real idiot for selling at $8k in 6 months.

I'd say the parent company of the NYSE opening a BTC futures exchange is more of a bullish indicator than OP's chart.
The problem with charts is that they can say whatever you want them to say. [This one]( says BTC will probably take a few more years to reach new highs.
Edit: chart is overlay of BTC '13-'14, and BTC '16-'19 (next in pattern would be '22-'31, with ATH in the center, so ~2027)
Edit 2: for more clarity, look at bottom of chart where it shows time scale. The shaded box on the left is the 2013 bull run, and the shaded box on the right is the 2017 bull run. Based on this. we wouldn't be at the beginning of a new bull run yet, we'd be at the tail end of the last bull run. (the end of the shaded section) - which says we have a LONG accumulation stage ahead.

People who bought at $18k would be a whole lot better off selling at $12k than holding all the way down to $3k.
Of course there's no guarantee what will happen, but "don't sell lower than whatever you bought" isn't flawless advice.

~~Well the chain size exceeded 1TB in 2018 and I see his post is from 2019 so not sure how he plans on having that work out.~~
Edit: Sorry that's for archive nodes.
A laptop is not ideal for running a full node, as he mentions battery dying, losing connection, etc. 
He tries stopping his full node multiple times to run with different settings.
Sorry but this guy failing to run a full node doesn't prove anything other than he made a bunch of mistakes.
@_date: 2019-09-28 01:37:14
It's pretty simple math.
If you bought at $18k and hold, and it hits $100k after a few years, you make $82k
If you bought at $18k, sell at $12k and rebuy at $3k, and then it hits $100k, you make $382k.
That's $300k more.
If you're not in it to make smart decisions, don't get in the game.

And does this one person qualify as "many" ?
It just doesn't logically make sense that there's a market like that and it's not saturated. There's not a demand for $10k per month to be spread across "many" people. People just don't buy that much RS gold.

Log scales are great for looking at the long term trend (not necessarily for predicting based on that trend).
What log scales are not good for is seeing the significance of losing more than 50% of value. In order for the lines not to look like squiggles, it would have had to drop to under $2k, or a 90% loss for anyone who bought high.

@_date: 2019-09-16 16:52:17
That's not what OP was asking. OP specifically asks about people's perception of it being bottom. Nothing about support levels, etc.
Also, strong long-term support levels don't form near a current long-standing price. $100mil support wall for instance might seem like a lot to a new investor. It fails to account that support walls can be cancelled without being traded, and that support walls generally hedge bets to get BTC at a discount. 
The longer BTC sits in one spot, the more comfortable people may become gambling for 5% discounts, but whales know that people chasing 5% have weaker hands than they do, and that's why we see 10-20% plummets when support levels are highest.
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:11:41
It's reasonable to assume bitcoin will whether the storms, sure. It's also reasonable to assume bitcoin will hit $2k between now and then. And that's based on historic chart data as well.
There have only been 2 halvings. Not exactly golden guarantees here.
But the person didn't say it's reasonable. They said historic chart data was the *best* indicator for btc, and asked how long it's going to take for people to see what's happening. (not what's likely to happen, but what's happening as if they do KNOW)
