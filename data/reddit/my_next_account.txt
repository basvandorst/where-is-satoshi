because this sub blindly upvotes misinformed meme garbage if it 'makes sense' to them

That's great, so eventually when the developers are hijacked or just get greedy, the malicious browser addon can swap out all the addresses I try to send money to.

When you search google for "Turkish Lira 30%" the only results you get are for 1) ZeroHedge and 2) this reddit post
How could a 30% single day crash not be reported anywhere but a conspiracy theory website?
Even more interesting is this graph: 
I don't really have a clue but I can see that Google says the Lira was worth $0.20 on August 5th and $0.15 on August 12th. That's 25% in 7 days, which is definitely less than 30% in 1 day. Can anyone explain what ZeroHedge knows that nobody else knows?

maybe you didnt learn that because it doesnt actually matter anyways

Lets see you try to buy a house without taking out a loan. You gonna just save up for 30 years and buy it all at once? While renting? For 30 years?
Oh but wait, that doesn't matter because you're a professional crypto day trader who's gonna be a billionaire tomorrow, right?

Why did you remove the music? Its much better with audio. Why not just post the original?

why the fuck would someone want to pay for something with $10,000 cash
I mean I get it, you guys don't like regulation, but nobody here would ever be affected by this at all. I understand the principle but why are you guys getting worked up over something so stupid? What kind of dumbass would carry OVER 10 grand in bank notes just to go make a purchase

This is so misinformed that it probably belongs here.

Browser addons can add something called "javascript" to your webpages, which is essentially computer speak for "a program." This means that if you install an addon from a sketchy publisher, they can run "a program" that changes what you see on your computer screen.
To make this as simple as possible, so that someone like you might have a chance at understanding it--its like someone intercepting all your mail, and changing things about it in a way you'll never notice, then delivering the mail to you again, sealed. So all your bills? The address is different, to trick you into sending money to the wrong person.
This has been done many times to popular browser addons, specifically gaming addons. Either the developer gets greedy or gets hacked, and the addon starts using malicious code to change bitcoin addresses on webpages to their own. So that eventually, when someone sends you an address, the man in the middle switches the address for a different one and you lose your money.

Cryptomat, get it? Its like a laundromat, but for your money, using crypto.

Awesome!! I totally forgot about Bitcoin until I saw this. I had no idea! I had a bunch from sooo long ago! I just gotta find my notebook so I can remember my MtGox login :) I haven't looked at for years but I just can't wait anymore.

The variance in the predictions just hurts so much. Like they "predicted" a bunch of exact spikes and swings. This shit-tier post is just a big ad for whatever garbage pump-and-dump blog that domain leads to. Fucking "arzdigital" less than two years old no name cryptospam site posting pointless artifact-riddled jaypeggs that are such low quality half the text is melting into the pixelated background.
OP should be banned from the internet for ten years, who is with me?

Some people can just call their parents if they can't pay a bill, but sometimes selling their crypto is less awkward than asking mommy &amp; daddy for a couple grand.
So while its a gamble they 'cant afford to lose', they really can afford to lose everything anyways because theres always a back up plan.

Your opinion is based on Reddit comments lol? You probably don't even understand the scale, US is huge and areas vary greatly, the big states are probably bigger than your home country in population and size, and Russia is pretty much just Moscow and a bunch of captured territory.
You just want to 'win' an internet argument but its pretty hilarious that you think the US is a bad place to live and that you'd prefer Russia. I mean if you like vodka, depression and suicide then sure Russia is your dream.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:07:13
The difference is that I'm right about Russia and you're wrong about USA

If you have to include your reasoning immediately after saying "pretty much confirmed" then maybe your theory isn't pretty much confirmed?
