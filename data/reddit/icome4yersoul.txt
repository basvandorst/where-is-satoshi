Who cares? We could threaten them with UASF round 2, then promise then whatever deals, they will comply.

You tell me? I love Blockstream, I love sidechains! Don't you?
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:31:41
I thought we wanted them to fork off? Isn't that for the best? I've been reading in this sub for months of the hatred we have towards them and their evil overlords (Jihan and Roger, devils incarnate!).
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:09:14
Ok, you believe in 300kb then, good for you :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:37:29
anything anti-blockstream is heresy, you heretic!
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:48:58
All inventions change and grow, this is the nature of our world.
Should we allow a recorded history? Or should we rewrite history and records (without letting people know of such changes) to serve our purpose?
This is the essence of re-writing white papers without amendments. But hey, if its for Blockstream and OUR coin, then we should do it! Fuck the future, all they will read is OUR version of the white paper that fits OUR coin!
This is how we shape history and peoples perceptions :)

But if people are not using segwit because there there is too much block space, then how can we fix malleability?
I just read how Luke is trying to reduce the 1mb to 300kb (though I think if we do 300kb, we might aswell do 30kb no?). I think its a great idea, it will make everyone use segwit and then we can finally fix that malleability thing.
good idea yes?
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:06:10
No, its a brilliant idea. Everyone can get capacity using the lightning network and sidechains, its obvious? We will be able to finally take fees from the fucking evil chinese miners ok? We've been fighting for this for years! But the damn bitcoin cash trolls have freed up space on bitcoin, they were spam anyway.
Reducing block size will make sure everyone uses our solutions and fixes malleability, and everyone wants that!
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:58:07
Research into what? why do i need to do any research? we just need to follow Blockstream, they know what's best. And once the White Paper is re-written to follow the Blockstream dream then what is there for non-bitcoiners to argue against?
They'll see the re-written white paper and will see that Bitcoin was meant to be for Sidechains and Segwit all along! Because the white paper was clearly wrong, we have 6 years prior to 2016 of Bitcoin clearly NOT working to show that. Greg said Bitcoin was broken anyway, so clearly the white paper should be re-written to his vision.
Your OP fits perfect with the dream, I don't know you argue against me :(
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:19:11
that 'spam' is a lot of people with coin exiting BTC into BCH, and the show has only just started
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:45:09
I agree, but I think we should put it 1 step further, if we do 300kb we might as well go to 30kb. Just imagine the number of amazing Sidechains we will be able to use!
We could create limitless tokens for whatever we wanted on Sidechains, it's a treasure waiting for us all to use wisely and carefully. :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:08:48
I fight for the Blockstream and Bitcoin Core dream :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:56:17
And we should use BCore for us, to help the newbies, it will really show the newbies the difference between the 2 coins, good idea!
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:31:41
I don't want to, I'm a BCore fan forever :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:50:48
apparently that silly bitcoin cash is
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:48:07
Yes! This is what I mean! No White Paper is infallible! We should be allowed to change them at will! Fuck amendments, who needs those? 
We don't want people to remember what was originally in such White Papers so we need to make sure its a rewrite and not amendments like other white papers. Honestly, I think you're onto something hot, if Cobra can get this rewrite through then we can start rewriting ALL the White Papers that slightly disagree with Blockstream and OUR dream. 
There's a few other White Papers out there we could rewrite after Cobra is done! We can rewrite history and shape it as WE deem fit!
I like the way you think ;)
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:13:31
lemmings away!
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:53:03
hmm? I take it you don't agree with Luke?
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:01:04
I think Luke's suggestion is great, not sure why you disagree with him, he's been right so far and we've all been better off for following him
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:35:27
I believe Tesla wrote his own papers on AC, they were very different from what Edison wrote (I'm a BIG fan of Tesla). The Edison papers/DC current were just forgotten about in the dustbin of history. 
We just moved onto better electricity (AC). But the papers on DC and AC were never 'rewritten'.
But neither have anything to do with Bitcoin, I'm just reminiscing (I didn't like how Edison tried to steal and claim Tesla's inventions as his own, this is known as "Intellectual Dishonesty", didn't mean much back then, but it means a LOT more now). 
Re-writing White Papers about Bitcoin though (and pretending Satoshi wrote it), that's all gravy (there's some others written by some contemporaries that back Satoshi's vision, those will have to be re-written also).
(because Tesla = &lt;3 )
 (this paper doesn't "re-write" Edisons paper, it acts as an 'addition')
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:17:12
derpity derp!
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:31:56
It should've read "Buy BCore", because we are B(hard)Core!
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:32:21
I don't know what you're talking about friend :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:14:15
I am, that's why I said you follow Luke's dream like me, so therefore you want to reduce 1mb to 300kb :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:52:54
Why so much aggression? I agree with you! Are people here normally as aggressive as you?
Like you said, its not a fucking bible you ignorant fool and this isn't some stupid religious cult! So what's wrong with Cobra re-writing it to fit Blockstreams dream vision for us all?
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:34:08
Yes, I believe this is the case.
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:33:11
have an upvote :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:35:53
they have smaller withdrawal limits if you're not verified (something like 5k euro per day, equivalent in crypto), but otherwise seem fine
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:22:17
hurp herp :D
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:58:18
cobra is going to re-write the white paper, so we should wait for him to get it more aligned to Blockstream's dream vision, then we can show people our better version of Bitcoin as a settlement layer, remember, bitcoin is NOT for those who live on $2 a day (ignore what the white paper says, its wrong! bitcoin is ONLY for those who can afford the more expensive life)
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:55:39
oh, I see you're posting here. I'm not sure why you're against Blockstream or Core, but you belong in that other troll sub if you don't agree with Luke and our vision, go troll over there!
