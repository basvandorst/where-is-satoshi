The most important thing is to spend a few months studying the neurology of small rodents in general, as well as ferrets specifically. You want to make sure that your species of pet has enough cognitive uniqueness that an attacker could not raise their own pet, under similar circumstances, and produce the same private key by chance. That's how I lost my first chunk of Bitcoin, which was valued at the time at $0.27. Turns out a farmer was using captured voles to produce private keys, and the neurology is similar in the two species.
Another important consideration is that, if someone kidnaps your ferret, they could reproduce the private key. To be extra-careful, I would recommend training the ferret to simply attack anyone but yourself. Ferrets have simple minds, and can't understand complex commands. My second chunk of Bitcoin lost was when my ferret tapped out the binary hexadecimal string in morse code upon the wrist of my girlfriend of 3 years. She immediately swiped my wallet and kidnapped the ferret. I had over $23 in that account... but that wasn't a failure of Bitcoin. It was a failure of me to trust my fiance. It may be years before I can trust her again.
I actually know a guy who is working on generating a private key from the frequency and distribution of piles of ferret poop he finds laying around, among his 43 ferrets. It might be a couple years before he perfects it, but I think he's onto something. If you're looking to get into pet-generated private keys, his technique might hold more long-term promise.
I'll let him know he can find someone else who's serious about this stuff. He'll get to you soon!
