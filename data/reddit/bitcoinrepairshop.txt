"I think it's people who are insecure about Bitcoin that end up being maximalists."
I started with Litecoin because I was insecure about Bitcoin. Then I bought Ethereum, Golem, OmiseGO, and some other shit, also because I was insecure about Bitcoin and wanted to bet on 'the next Bitcoin'. After being misled by FUD I eventually studied Bitcoin with due diligence, sold every shitcoin, and now I'm a Bitcoin maximalist, because I'm more confident than ever about Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is money, all the rest is just an investment like the stock market.

Bitcoin is a **Global** Monetary System.

It's because the world runs by the people working for the elite, however, the people believe the world runs by the elite working for them. As soon as the people realize they don't need 80% of what they want or have—that saving money is **not** bad—the fairy tale of infinite economic growth will crumple fast.
This is what's sad about all these protests in the world. While I encourage taking action against corruption, disproportionate wealth inequality, etc., far too much it comes to down to "change things for us!", while they don't know what they actually want. The most effective and nonviolent thing those people could do is just stop buying things, or stop giving money to governments they distrust, en masse. Don't lose an eye fighting incompetence, let supply and demand do its thing.
