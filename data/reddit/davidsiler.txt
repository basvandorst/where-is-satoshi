I’d avoid the Coinbase app altogether. Last time I transferred to Coinbase with the app (intending to transfer to Coinbase Pro) it put my funds on hold for 18 days. All it would let me do was buy coins on the app at higher fees. It wouldn’t even let me transfer to Coinbase Pro or withdraw the coins for 18 days either. 
Now I haven’t used Pro in a while except to transfer out to my bank. So Pro my have the same hold bs. If I remember right the app fee is 1-1.5% and to place a limit order on Pro is 0.25%.  If your bank is linked on the app it should already show up on Pro. 
You can buy and withdraw BTC on Cash app. Doesn’t charge any fees, but I don’t know what kind of spread they have. 
[Abra]( has a 1% spread and is much cleaner to use than Coinbase if you don’t want the hassle of the Pro Exchange. They have a $25 sign up bonus. 
I use itBit to transfer up to $3,000 out for free. Deposits are only wire transfers. 
Gemini is good too. Same fees as CB on the app, but around 0.25% on their pro exchange.

On BTC? Yea, that’s 1.25%. My goal is 0.25% max. Trading limit/maker orders on exchanges, Gemini is 0.25% and Coinbase Pro is 0.15%. I’m willing to go through the trouble to save 1%. That 1% premium is what some are willing to pay for convenience.

Where did you get that mug? That’s awesome

Yep. You can take a hit and get out, or you can wait a couple months to break even. Zoom out. This will probably bounce off 8.8k and keep going up. It just went from 3 to 14, this is a normal correction.

I’d wait for the correction to level off and trend higher. Most agree on $8,800 as a good support range. I’d wait. But if you’re going to just hold to 100k in a couple years, I’d buy up every dip.
