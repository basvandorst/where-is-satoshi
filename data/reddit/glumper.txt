English in neither my first or second language so bare with me. I can see how people thrive on a different opinion on reddit and are so narrow minded on certain cases. 
Also what makes you the pinnacle of information based around this subject, how many times have honestly debated with an American economist around this subject?
Finally I will leave this sub alone
But please invest wisely in future

Thank you for the help and links! 
Even if the price inflation would not increase the production but after viewing people's reactions they have a arrowed view that the price of Bitcoin will continue to maintain or keep this massive growth in the value?

How can this currency be exempt from inflation because you know the distribution limits, there are many factors which are involved in inflationary pressures not just the supply side being regulated can control such influences

Unfortunately I am not to familiar with the American citizens entitlement with what there currency is worth outside of the trusted fiscal value. But any form of physical currency still has value in it no matter how small the value maybe. 
You are right I do see this as an exciting venture in to a new form of currency not based on a group of politicians limited understanding of markets but it scares me to see how sure minded people are the future regarding inflation and the base value of it.

I can see your point and I'm sure that the majority of people know a significant deal more than me in certain areas but when people believe that this currency is exempt from certain factors which apply to any currency or business model. 
Another factor that certain people always bring up is the FED inability to control variables which can be controlled in the form of currency however unlike all other basic currency's on the FOREX the have a form in monetary value behind them e.g (gold) value but I'm personally not sure which monetary system it is based on?

That is fine, I can defiantly agree with your statements and take on board all off your criticisms as I can see you have knowledge of the subject.
But I still do not understand how people can be certain that there will be a flat rate produced?
Has there been any cases of fraud so far and how much protection is there to stop a sudden influx of fraudulent currency being used in the market? 
Also if you would be so kind to help me, from all of my research so far I have found that bit coin is stored on a physical device is this true or can it be stored digitally as well? 
And finally would would happen if Bitcoin started to be reject as a form of currency and value dropped overnight, meaning the majority of investors would pullout, do you not believe this would alter the set inflation plan?
