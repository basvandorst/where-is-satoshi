The best advice is just don't. If you want to try getting rich, do something more stable like traditional stocks and shares.

You people are obsessed to the point of delusion

I think the sub on the whole is pretty enjoyable. Just think these silly fantasies of overthrowing the international banking system and the purging of anyone who thinks otherwise are driving people away from the community in droves.

His point was that it's not useful as a currency due to its volatility. Why should somebody use a clunkier, more volatile currency over something as stable as USD

Stop avoiding his points and just address the statement that it's not valid as a currency.

Again, you're just using this as an excuse to not argue the statement that bitcoin is not a viable currency for the reasons mentioned above. In face, you're not even correct about currency not being attached to an underlying assets, as non fiat currency is often pegged to some central reserve of precious metal. Stop dodging the question and address the points that bitcoin is A. Too volatile to be used as a currency and B. Not easily transferrable (fees, tx block size etc)

It's forever going to be volatile because it's got no real underlying asset to pin the value to. A measure of a good currency is it's stability and ease of transfer, bitcoin fails on both of these fronts and as such is bad as a currency, not difficult

Even if we throw out the underlying asset argument, it still doesnt pass the litmus test for a good currency. You're attempts to bypass the argument are pretty glaring dude.
