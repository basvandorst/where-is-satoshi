This applies to anything you can buy on credit. Literally anything. Cars, clothes, homes, whatever. You’ve never bought something that you no longer wanted? What about electronics that loose value like bitcoin. You buy a $4,000 computer and 2 years later it’s lagging and garbage in comparison to what’s out. But it’s only worth a few hundred now. Do you not pay back your credit. It isn’t the fact that people won’t pay back the credit, that’s why we have a credit rating system. It’s a level of trust. If you trust someone to pay you back a certain amount of predetermined money, they should be allowed to spend it on whatever they want. Don’t act like you can’t go to Vegas with a credit card and blow every dollar in a day. 
And if anyone should be scared it should be the Wells Fargo customers. Isn’t Wells Fargo the real scammers who stole thousands of identities to open accounts?

how they start and what they are currently defined as in law are two different things. its not a currency NOW so you are wrong about that. Don't get the term cryptocurrency confused with it being a legitimate currency. There is no country in the world required to accept crypto. legal tender(currency) is required by law to be accepted as a form of payment.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:06:06
um thats not called laundering money. laundering money is the process of making money looking like it came from a legitimate source. you clearly dont know what you're speaking on. a bunch of people giving you money from returning electronics is still just a bunch of people giving you money. so if you have 100,000 in cash and they use credit cards to buy and return then get the cash you still need to have paperwork onwhere the cash came from "oh 10 people just gave me $100,000" isn't going to cut it.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:02:16
But it’s not considered cash. No law has crypto as cash. None! It’s fraud, then pyramid scheme, then digital asset. But cash? Nope! Never been cash

I understand your concern but I say trade. I have a hardware wallet but you can’t really day trade from a hardware wallet

This is false information. Returns are not always done innoriginal payment method. Can’t think of any at the moment but I have done it many times before. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:11:46


In fact, that is what you insinuated with the quote you wrote I'll put it below in case you forgot. keyword **always**, meaning, impossible otherwise.


You've worked retail, you didn't create the guidelines for every store in the world. I never had to work retail because I always made my own money with my own businesses and investments. so, for you to try to use the fact that I didn't slave for some company as a way to prove your point which is still false is ludicrous
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:37:39
But you originally stated that it did not happen. That’s what my original comment was about. Rather it happened at your place, or only some places, or if it’s a stupid idea is irrelevant. I was correcting your statement that it’s impossible or doesn’t happen. That is all. 
You got in to the “why it shouldn’t happen” I stayed on the “that it actually does”
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:38:01
no, it. isnt a currency.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:48:21
there are plenty of stores you can purchase items from on credit and return them for cash as well. should we consider those stores to be cash advances as well?
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:07:22
i did read your contradictions, yes. but you also stated it couldn't happen. make your mind up
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:46:24
I disagree, an individual willing to scam will find a way. Rather that’s buying a bunch of shit to return it for cash and buying crypto with that. There’s a million ways to fool the system. There will always be a work around and people will simply exploit it. Their only blocking for lack of a better term at the moment those legitimate customers who aren’t looking to exploit the system 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:41:54
i dont know many people who buy homes with cash or start businesses entirely without a business loan

I plan to put it on another exchange to transfer to another coin. 
My original plan was switch to BTC on exchange 1&gt; DGB on exchange 1&gt;transfer to exchange 2&gt; switch from DGB to BTC on exchange 2&gt; then buy the coin I’m looking to get on exchange 2. 
Lot of work. But could all be done within 15 minutes. So with BTC being cheaper and faster, did the exchanges like bittrex specifically drop their fees for withdrawing and are they also up to date on the speeds of transfer? Would save me a bunch of fees and shit if I cold go straight from BTC on exchange 1 to exchange 2 within 30 or so minutes. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:01:15
That wasn’t the original post I commented on. You added that in on a later response. But I’m not going to continue the debate on something so trivial. Enjoy your day
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:57:26
I’ve done that. But there’s 2 of them that I don’t know what they are for. That’s the issue. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:12:54
Then your credit rating drops and you won’t receive the credit anymore. Its all a level of trust. I’m not for or against it, as I don’t buy crypto on credit, it’s just odd that it’s considered a cash advance when it isn’t cash. Sure, it can be liquidated quickly but so many other items you buy that aren’t considered cash advances. I can buy a brand new laptop and drop it and break it or spill coffe and Fry the motherboard. Do I not pay the credit card company? Well, that depends on me as an individual. All I’m saying is, this is not a cash advance, I am not withdrawing cash. I am buying an item. We keep talking about these crashes. But I’ve had much more success in crypto than losses. There’s two sides to that coin. Is it a cash advance if I purchase a website to drive traffic to for ad revenue. Spend 5,000 dollars to set it up designed to a tee and don’t make a dollar from it? At what point is the line drawn? Can we figure out what crypto is first because at this point crypto currency is not in any way shape or form considered cash by any entity. I’m not arguing the point because I’m mad, as stated I don’t use credit to buy crypto, and what is it $10 and a little higher percentage for the advance. You can easily safely trade and do 10-30% profit on crypto daily. I don’t care about a cash advance fee. It’s them putting one on something that isn’t cash. A crooked company at that. Doesn’t trust its customers, but is the one to have committed fraud against them. Doesn’t trust their customers but grants them credit. I mean make your mind up. And the way you stick up for them is quite crazy. It’s not really fraud. Some employees turned to fraud because of the pressure that Wells Fargo put on them. Come on now, really? So now the ceo has to commit the fraud to consider it company fraud. This wasn’t the case of one employee. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:00:50
Of course I see this happening. That’s one thing I’d agree with you on. But that has nothing to do with our conversation. I don’t see the point. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:15:47
Do I have to work in retail to be a customer that gets cash back from a return on a credit card purchase? I don’t see the significance of the question. 
I never said all places do it, and you’re right that it’s easier with debit card purchases, but it’s not impossible with a credit card purchase either. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:03:49
Wish it were that easy. I have 15 + of them. And the 2 I can’t figure out could belong to a number of sites that I may never remember. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:40:00
what does any of this have to do with the cash advance fee? this same scenario can apply to anything that you buy and most of those things dont even have the possibility of you being able to resell them at a higher cost.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:01:40
That’s a risk they take and the amount of risk depends on the trust they have in you to repay your debts. We act as though people don’t default on loans and credit all the time. Crypto wasn’t the beginning of this phenom

@_date: 2017-05-08 05:11:17
coinbase was waaaaaay easier for me to get into. the point im making though is, even if it is hard to get in coinbase, they wont accept your money until you are verified. kraken will take you through two timely verification steps, then tell you "oh wait, you are in the US, you need to go through a third verification step" then once they take their sweet time to verify that will tell you you are good to deposit money. you go deposit money and they don't put it in your account. the money gets locked "by the bank" supposedly (synapses bank) which of course I tried contacting and they have a google voice number which I find quite funny. there is no way to get your money back and the process is another 5-10 business days for this additional verification that they never told you about. Ive been trying to work with kraken for a looooong time and my money still is not in my account with no way for me to get it back. I simply have to wait on them to figure it out however long that takes.
I'm on day 43 from the time I started the first tier verification to today. and my money still has yet to arrive in my account. about 15 of those days don't count though as I didn't immediately start a deposit once I was verified tier 3
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:26:34
dont do kraken. they will lock up your money after verifying you all the way to tier 3. once you deposit your money it will be locked up on hold with no way to get it out
read my thread [here](
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:46:06
Just thinking about how they operate. You'd probably not even have to wait for the wire. They'd probably credit you instantly. Then as soon as you deposit that $500+. Here comes the drama. Lol. What makes me the maddest was that money was going straight to ethereum. It had more than doubled since then. Lol jokes on me

MAY 8TH 2017 UPDATE: I have been trying to get in touch with snyapsespay as kraken says synapses stopped the transaction because they needed a photo copy of my social. so to speed things up, I have tried calling synapses(which is a google voice number by the way) and emailing them. I finally receieved an email from them today stating






so Im not sure what to make of this, but it my emails to synapses I mentioned the hold up being them needing to verify the photo copy of my social security card. in their response, they had no mention of this and basically told me to contact Kraken. so at this point Im thinking that kraken is holding my money without reason

Finally was able to get support to reset something and allow for me to upload my SS card.  and here is the response


so, this would make it up to about 10 days from the time I wired the funds to have them in my account. thanks kraken
@_date: 2016-07-20 22:12:17
2nd possibility is odd. Why coinbase would allow a 2nd account to use the same bank info tied to my account. I guess I will just have to wait for a response from them to find out whats going on.
@_date: 2016-07-22 20:33:22
Its a bitcoin forum. is it not possible that someone else has had the same experience with a bitcoin exchange?
For someone who complains about people whining when they have reason to be concerned, you certainly do keep coming back in this topic to whine.
Are you as crazy as you make yourself out to be?
@_date: 2016-07-20 23:24:12
These weren't deposits.
@_date: 2016-07-21 04:00:18
the amounts were under $5. I do recall seeing the option for recurring buy but highly doubt that I set it up. If I did want to set that up I would certainly do it for more than these amounts. It was 2 amounts on the same day as well. I'll double check though
no recurring buy setup.
@_date: 2016-07-21 01:49:11
Are you upset? Its been known that coinbase takes quite a while to respond to their support tickets. I also posted a question in the OP thinking that maybe it was some test that they do every so often of not using the account or something else that I was unaware of which is why I posted what I did. Given their slow response times, it would be nice to have some insight if there was a legit reason for these charges. Maybe some fee or something that I missed out on. I'd rather not wait a week for a response to find out that my bank account info was compromised. If you have any issues, feel free to not read the topic. Do you work for coinbase? if so, maybe you should go and respond to the ticket?
    Is there some bi-monthly fee or something on coinbase?
that was the point. What was the point of your useless response?
    like someone here has the answer for you.
Well, I wouldn't know if they did or didn't unless I asked, right?
@_date: 2016-07-24 05:16:07
UPDATE: Well, after about 4 days of waiting to find out about these fraudulent holds on my bank account, I finally recieved a response from coin base. You ready?
It said " sorry for the delay. if you still need help with this issue, please respond to this missage"
are you fucking kidding me? So you guys are placing hold/charging bank accounts without autorization, force people to communicate with you, waste 4 days on their time only to tell them the wait was long so you should have it taken care of, if not feel free to wait much longer by letting us know that we didnt provide you with any help the first time. this has got to be a damn joke
@_date: 2016-07-21 06:36:40
I dont know much about these issues as I've only used them a hand full of times. I've never paid more than the rate shown on the main page and it has always been instant and never had a double withdraw. This is the only time I have had an issue with them it's just odd that it comes months after my last time using them, and the amounts being so small has me scratching my head.

@_date: 2016-07-22 02:48:43
then stop reading, idiot! is it whining when your account has money missing, randomly charged by a company that wont respond to you? You must work for coinbase. I find it odd that you decided to respond though. If your tired of it, why come in here and reply at all? What you are doing is considered whining. I have a reason to make the post that I did. whats your reason? oh, to whine. get lost
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:53:38
I understand I will still have the coins but I assume bitcoin will have a separation of sorts. With this, I'm guessing one version of bitcoin will start to loose value while the other gains value. How do we get on the proper version of bitcoin at that point?
