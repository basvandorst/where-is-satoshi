And I invested in a scam and lose all my savings. Now I am trying to save again, and I hope that I can save enough to pay for my daughter's college tuition.
If you know any good Samaritans open to donate some extra BTCs feel free to pass my contact :)

well, the bottom bottom is $0 of itself (Rick and Morty reference here lol)
But I would shoot for $3000
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:27:06
No, but same story
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:02:06
Time to sell! :)

Robinhood accept BTC and US stock trading.

Thank you for the empathy! I appreciate it. My psychologist say that talking about it will help to stop the "bad" thoughts.
I would appreciate any ideas of how to get back any of my lost funds
@_date: 2019-11-06 20:16:29
I don't say it is the same, I say it may be similar to the past. But it may also not be even close, so nobody knows. There are not a way to predict the price, but you can predict a pattern based on the past performance, and low your risk

**Hug my parents for one hour**, and **pet my dog**, and go on a walk with him, and play fetch with him in the park with his favorite orange.
You know, true happiness is not in money, it is on family. 
And we never appreciate what we have while we have it.

DID HE SAID WORTHLESS???
I am also open for donations lol
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:39:54
Yeah, it should grow over 11k and fall again under 3k.
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:45:19
In a way, I have to give you some credit, I think I was greedy, but not to get rich as you say, I am trying to get out of my debt and pay for my daughters college tuition. I am not coming from a rich family, I am a hard worker trying to save for my family. Every penny that I lose I earn it and save it. I know I did it wrong, that's why I was looking for help.
Well, it is life, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, I just make sure to learn from my mistake and move forward.
Thank you for the comments though.
@_date: 2019-11-06 18:01:46


I would say that you will lose everything if you sell when the price goes down. Prices always go up again, but there are cycles, understand the cycles to know when to sell.
We are in a time of incertitude, nobody knows what it is going to happen, prices may go up or down, but at the end luck benefits to the most patient.
Please never sell on panic or you will have big loses.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:20:30
This makes me so depressed, that I may well put an end to everything if BTC ever reach that amount. 
Recently I was victim of a online scam and I lose 4 BTC, and I have to pay for my mortgage, credit card debt, and my daughters college tuition, and struggle to get to the end of the month.
Scammers don't know how fast they can destroy a life when they scam middle class workers like me and take all the savings.
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:49:24
At least you didn't lose your BTCs like me. When you get to the point where you can pass KYC they will release the founds. But in my case, I lose my BTCs to a online scam.
If this helps, some times KYC takes a lot of time.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:54:23
I am glad that my mistakes are helping you to get some lessons. 
Next weekend I am going to be working on the development of a web crawler that is going to automatize my transactions using machine learning (.NET ML). Maybe multiple services working on parallel. 
At least I am getting motivation to do cool projects.
@_date: 2019-11-18 16:31:17
Thank you! I will take a look of that.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:17:58


The limit is around 3k indeed.
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:55:11
At least you still have the BTCs on your wallet. I fell for a scam and lose my BTCs.
Now I am driving Uber to save for the loses, on top of my full time job. 
Some life lessons take too much from you.
Right now BTC price is going down, and it may reach the bottom at $3000, but it will raise again. Very likely to reach near 20k again, so HODL ;)

I invested on a system that promise me to increase my investment and grant a daily percent of return. I was thinking to invest until I have enough to pay for the credit card debt and my daughters college tuition, and a couple of medical bills that are over $1k. 
I calculated that it will take around 3 months if I invest my retirement savings on it. 
The though of becoming debt free and being able to save more money to pay for my house and being able to buy a new mower was very exciting to me. 
I test that I was able to withdraw my investment a couple of times, just to be sure, and everything was looking fine. So I cashed out my 401k and I bough BTC. I invest it and wait for 3 months, after that once I was ready I try to cash it out, but the system was telling me that I wasn't able to cash out because there was another pending transaction, so I contacted customer support, and they told me that they escalated the issue to the IT department and they where waiting for a response. 
So I wait few days, and then I contact them again, receiving the same response. 
I keep waiting and contacting them in an endless loop for two months. Eventually the website disappear and my BTCs with it.  
I feel so stupid and powerless, they got away with my savings and I could use that money to pay part of my debt instead. It is truly depressing, and I just want to roll into a ball and hide under a desk and die every time that I think about it. I don't know if I ever will get over it. 
There are other things that happened in the mean time, I was sent to the hospital with a hart attack and then I received the bill from the hospital (more than $15k) just to discover that the health insurance does not cover everything and I have another large bill to pay.
At this point it makes me happy to know that I have a good life insurance and if anything happens to me my wife and daughter will be well covered, because man, you never know what is going to happen next..

I am going to watch The Office again, starting this weekend.
I think I watch it 8 times already, but again..
After Michael left the show has never been the same.
But definitely Dwight was one of my favorite characters. But I would never understand why he chose to marry Angela, instead of Esther.  Angela keep rejecting him while Esther is open to betray her family to be with him.
Angela's son is also Dwight's, so he should be taking care of him, but not marry Angela because of that.

This is the world that we live on now, there is no way to be out of cryptocurrencies. Learn, adapt or get extinct.
One mistake is not going to hold me back, even if is an huge mistake like mine. 
Rather this is going to be a learning experience, and help me to progress.
@_date: 2019-11-20 18:56:15
Good point, I didn't noticed :)
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:02:57
I didn’t get to the point that I cannot get out of debt by myself, but it will be nice to be debt free.
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:08:38
I guess in a way you are right, but greed may not be exactly the best term, since I am not looking to get rich, but to become free of debt and give my daughter a good future.
The scammers are soulless people that wouldn't hesitate to steal your grandma's retirement fund.
In my case, I still don't know what I am going to do with my taxes, but there are people that lose everything and are too old to work.
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:07:35
That’s good to know! Thank you for the information!
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:55:11


Thank you Sir! I have a positive mindset, and I know this is just a rock on my path :)
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:30:38
My wife is the boss, I am only a worker :)
@_date: 2019-10-29 18:08:34
I am the same way, but it gets hard when you have a bunch of things to fix on the house and the car plus pay for the medical expenses that are not cheap at all.
In USA there is no universal healthcare, and even with medical insurance the bills keep coming and coming. Last year I had a mayor surgery and the insurance covered most of the bills (yeah it reach $25k), but I had to pay $3k from that, plus they just sent me another bill of $300. This system sucks!
What I mean is that even if I am good saving and I try not to use my credit cards, there are some things that you don’t expect that also need to be paid. And that always bite you back.
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:00:38
See, that’s where you are wrong, my goal was to save money for my daughter college tuition, and pay my credit card debt. If there where any extra will be to pay part of my mortgage. 
I love my work, and I will probably never retire, I am a hard worker and I am also the type of guy that come to the office and say good morning and bring donuts for my fellow coworkers. It is not about being greedy, it is about freedom ;)
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:00:13


I guess I did.. I am not feeling good for that, but definitely a lesson learned.
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:07:50


I don't think that I am lazy or greedy, I am just concerned by my daughter's future, but I guess I envision my future more comfortable having the profit that Profitcoins was promising and I felt for it.  
I was very busy during that time, having a new born, being home owner (sometimes thats another job lol) and working full time. Definitely I didn't do enough research of it, and now I regret it. But lesson learned
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:49:31
lol I prefer to be on my jeans and sweater, no Adidas, regular shoes. I am a family guy (not like Peter Griffin)
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:59:00


You are very wise, and totally right, I do appreciate the encouragement words! I am feeling bad about that, but I am looking at my future with a positive mindset. I hope you guys get a very good Karma for this amazing help.  Thank you ChampOfTheFuture :)
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:47:51


I am originally from Europe, but I am citizen of USA now, and very proud of being a citizen since I can vote now. Thanks for asking :)
And yeah, crazy as it sounds, I actually did that mistake of trusting them, I got my lesson and learned from it.
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:53:56
As soon as I have enough time I will text you ;)
@_date: 2019-10-29 01:40:40
My friend, the American dream is more than a concept, it is a feeling, and a way of life. It took me years to understand it, and now I am living on it.
@_date: 2019-10-31 13:46:55
Yeah, I don't like to have to pay every time I am going to the doctor. Last time I had a pneumonia and I had to pay $200 because the doctor want to see xrays of my chest to do the diagnosis.
Next elections, the candidate that offers free universal healthcare will get my vote (most likely Bernie Sanders)
@_date: 2019-10-29 20:44:53
I wasn’t expecting to get that amount of money, my plan was to withdraw when I had enough to pay for the credit card debt and my daughters college tuition.
I am sharing this so other people can also learn from my mistakes, as I did.
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:53:25
I am totally agree with you, lessons like that are priceless, but some times comes with a small price tag :)
The key is to be open minded and take it with a smile and move forward.
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:13:26


I never smoke! Not that I have anything against smokers, but I try to be healthy. (Ok, I like fried chicken, but it is not everyday that I eat it)
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:18:33
Thank you for that! I know I am not the only one. It is a big shock to discover that one made the worst mistake ever and got scammed. I was investing my retirement savings to get money to pay for my daughter's college tuition. I know I will never get my BTCs back, and I don't really care if I become homeless as long as my daughter has a good future and a good education.
Eventually I will buy more BTCs and keep the keys at home.
I know it is a life lesson, and I definitely learned from it.
By the way, the platform was Profitcoins, which is already offline. But I just found out that they are now Profitcoins24. 
Here is the site on trustpilot, please feel free to review the site before they scam more people.
Thanks again Paskapilluperse, I deeply appreciate your comment.

Also it is a way to gamble based on his own word, something that is gone missing over the years.
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:58:38
The study of historic patterns is always very interesting, sometimes you can do very good predictions over the future price.
And to do predictions nobody is better than an AI. 
That's why I am building my own automatic trading software, using Selenium and Microsoft Machine Learning .Net ([ML.Net]( For now I am getting a compound daily interest of 5 to 10%, but I hope that with some fine tuning I will double or triple that amount. 
Wish me good luck :)
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:22:27
Pay off my mortgage, and debt. And most important pay my daughters college tuition.
If I have anything extra, I will also save for my daughter so she has a good head start after college.

And I just want him to bring me back my 4 BTCs that I lose in a crypto-scam, and invest it on my daughter's college tuition fund.
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:14:18
If there is something that I learned by hitting my head against a wall is this:
Not your keys, not your coins
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:29:28
be careful, I felt for a scam and I lose 4BTCs, and it's not joke, of course I bough it when it was cheaper, but wait for the price to drop, and HODL :)
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:36:26
Absolutely stunning video.
Too late for me, I already lose my 4BTC on a scam, but I love to see this type of videos because it helps people to avoid investing on scams and do the same mistakes that I did.
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:07:25

@_date: 2019-12-03 22:01:52
wait for the responses lol
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:15:26
I am not agree with this, it looks like people in college are smart enough to reject free money if they don't know where it comes. That is a very smart thing to do.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:53:30


Just noise, HOLD :)
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:01:13
I already lose my 4 BTCs, I don't care about BTC anymore.
The moment I invested on BTC was the second biggest mistake of my life.
(I am mad right now, probably I will buy some BTCs tomorrow, but today I hate myself for even thinking to invest on it..)
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:37:00
Just noise, weak buyers are panic selling instead holding. No worries
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:02:25
Time to buy! Actually look at the price rising :)
@_date: 2019-12-27 21:37:11










Very likely.

@_date: 2019-12-20 14:59:21
This is the best comment of the year.
I have a better idea: 
 **Any price prediction should be preceded by "** ***I will donate to every BTC account on my comment if is not going to happen. But if happen every single account on my comment will donate to my BTC account.*****"**
It is more fun, since there is two ways of outcome, that the guy lose all his BTCs, or the guy gets rich..
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:44:46
I don’t think so, all the information on their site was fake. Also fake staff and fake address. No way to recover it. 
Maybe a Christmas miracle if I recover from my loss. In the meantime I had to take two jobs to get to recover a little bit. It sucks to work 80+hours/week, and don’t get to spend more time with my family
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:36:22
Not always that there is a server error it is a scam. I have a lot of BTC invested and they are giving me a big profit. I am going to pay my daughter college tuition with this.
