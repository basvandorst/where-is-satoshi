Yeah there was a big argument when it was posted earlier this week some people didn't like that it said ' peer to peer' as that hasn't been the case for bitcoin for years; but it says that it was created for use in P2P txs not that is *is* P2P txs only.

I don't think this is right. Satoshi said that when we hit th eblock limit we can raise it higher. His exact proposal had flaws but everyone agreed with the idea and that is what we all thought would happen. The block size limit is there, and we may bump against it but we are *never* pressed against it.
That's a bitcoin I don't want to use, it's not in line with the white paper, it's not in line with the ideas of cypherpunks or those behind Bitcoin.

So? We can speculate all day long, I know very little about bitfury other than they were working on advanced miners, the've raised some money, and the land registry thing recently. No idea who rogers is.
But you allege that BF is working with some part of the security agency for US, no?
Let's speculate on how, or why
BF may be founded by ex members of the gov, they may have been working 'off the books' so to say in a sort of unofficial capacity.
BF may have used gov connections to facilitate the mining production facilities it currently has.
BF may have used gov research or advanced knowledge in designing it's ASICs and other infrasture.
They could all be making money together, rogers could be an investor.
Could they do anything nefarious? How could the hurt other people from their point of control?

That seems a sort of retard question to ask doesn't it. if the majority or hashpower went to classic, we would still have Bitcoin. Obviously. The exchange rate might be trending up because of FOMO or overcoming years old technical problem or showing that Satoshi's idea that bitcoin can fork if the devs ever go against the system works.
@_date: 2016-04-15 14:09:43
Of course, much will depend on the technology itself, **its scalability**, its level of maturity, the controls and environment surrounding it, the standardization and accessibility of transactions data, **the quality of management and governance**, and the **policy environment in which it is deployed**.

@_date: 2016-04-22 00:11:17


this is not true,
A pre-release of the whitepaper and the release of the white paper itself both happened in 2008 but Bitcoin the network didn't operated until Jan 3rd 2009, and Satoshi didn't even tell anyone until the 9th. (though it is strange that block  doesn't appear to have been mined by SN but seems to have been mined before SN released the network to others)


that's not how you write that either
@_date: 2016-04-23 00:09:13


Citation? Source? 
I've read everyone publicly available he wrote and that is not the impression I have.
I see that he didn't address or consider node/mining split, and that he considered SPV nodes for individuals but that isn't what I am talking about and it isn't the subject at hand.
Business right now don't run full nodes, why should they? But if btc continues to grow they might be the ones, not regular people, who could and would run the full nodes.

This was posted to //btc yesterday, I hope we can have a civil discussion and not just ban or censor discussion
Oh I've seen this argument before, shall we address some of the specious reasoning?


There is ample evidence Satoshi designed Bitcoin to never have full blocks, there is no evidence I have ever seen that indicates he designed it to have always full blocks.     
Blocks are full, for all intents and purposes, so this is as many people as can ever use bitcoin in their current capacity. So those who think the block size should never be raised are also saying that it is fine if bitcoin never grows anymore than it currently is.


-citation needed- not that some people say it, but the actual numbers I have seen indicate that we would be fine to have bigger blocks right now the nuances of the situation are such that 1) Bitcoin was designed this way (read the white paper and comments by SN) 2)how, exactly does it decease decentralization and what is the acceptable limit. I see a lot of handwaving and forecasted doom but no specifics and no supporting data that isn't greatly exaggerated beyond reality.


What is that limit? It sounds like the OP doesn't fully understand the situation. Aside from having a bigger limit =/= the blocks being that size (see all of the history of btc before we started having frequently fully full blocks), is he talking about nodes? because, again, bitcoin was not designed for every backwoods farmer to run a full node - please re-read the whitepaper OP. Does he mean miners (who should in theory also have a full node), in which case, what is the meaning of his use of the word decentralization?


A adaptable limit or flex cap of some sort would solve this problem, finding a solution that isn't so easy to manipulate by any one body is the hard part


Have you read how Satoshi suggested we raise the block size whenever it got reached? Just like the last point this was too easy to manipulate and it is probably the only reason it wasn't implemented. However the idea that the designer designed bitcoin to never have full blocks is very apparent, also the idea that the designer of bitcoin designed bitcoin to increase the blocksize whenever needed shows that the OP is talking about some alt-coin he wants to exist but not Bitcoin (much of the problem with this debate is old users are censored and new users get bad information and know no history or facts and just recite false ideas)


This is a point of view directly contrasted by the point of view in the Bitcoin whitepaper which states that nodes including full nodes will be big data center like things in the far future 


Oh I think this is another big misunderstanding that people who haven't done any research often repeat. What happened to Ether is exactly what was supposed to happen in a bitcoin forking event, again have you (OP) read the white paper? Have you read anything Satoshi wrote? Have you done any research on bitcoin?     
The fork went off exactly as it should have, and as any fork would have; may the strongest chain survive and if multiple chains arise then all previous holders are double coin holders.


*perceived effects* by the public, bitcoin would recover, you all want it to be a honey badger and that's just what it would do. it would be fine and there might be some bad media, idiots would lose some money, the world would go on and we would be so much better for it


So, the devlopers work on a software client for bitcoin (the reference client - there can be no main reference client), 


That is your perception, but from everything above you have a tenuous grasp of the situation, its cause, and any solutions. In fact the BIP102 which had a jump in the block size limit (not actual block size, remember) was rejected at the time as being too conservative; so the OP who has no understanding is happy with this


Where are you getting these ideas from? seg wit will give some max ~1.7 multiplier when it is fully implimented, but not to everyone, the same for Schoor but that would totaly rewrite all of the bitcoin software and basic engine design, so not coming soon if ever. and again, that only saves data for some people, not all
So no, what OP said is again misinformation, there is no 2X increase and if there was via SW+SS it woulnd't be for everyone and not for years at a minimum. 


Sweet lord athie, you (OP) have not a single clue as to what you ahve been saying other than the words, you have done no research, you don't understand all the jeopardizing changes at the protocol level you yourself just suggested, in lieu of the simpler design idea proposed by the creator and designer of Bitcoin (who many people accepted as the right idea, that is why we feel so betrayed at the change in direction after a new set of developers took over and kicked out the person who gave them access, who SN gave access to)
No one is saying we shouln't invesitgate other things, but they aren't here and the earlier proposed and accpeted solution is not being implimented, that scene in billy madison where they are dumber from hearing the speech, that speech was  your comment. 
OP has done no actual research on Bitcoin, they don't seem to have any idea what they are talking about.      
Can someone please get this to them?
@_date: 2016-10-25 02:08:12

@_date: 2016-10-25 02:10:49
The obvious retort would be that when miners set their own limits for minimun tx fee then a *real* fee market will arise. If you read some of the thoughts on btc by its designer you might see that he said it was likely *some* miners would always allow *some* small number of free txs to those willing to wait longer than 10 minutes.

To your title I think is still operational, if a bit strange without more input.
To you question, as has been said the orpahn rate is the problem. To say more precisely, with half the time, twice as many blocks per time unit are found, which means on average twice as many orphan blocks (napkin math, don't judge).
Not to say it wouldn't be better, but we'll probably never know. Satoshi said he made educated guesses on many variable and with layer 2 solutions (if they occur in time to save bitcoin) we will probably never see anything between a 10 minute and 10 second time frame

The CIA thing only shows how dumb some people are, the CIA would not invite a cover agent to publicly present on a topic they had him in. 
If anyone is a CIA plant in regards to Bitcoin is almost has to be anyone *but* Gavin. A better question would be, who gained interest not too long before the CIA asked gavin to come in, and who contributed more after that as to gain the trust of the early community. 
Think like the enemy, which Gavin is almost certainly not, at least not wittingly.

There should be no problem with allowing some on chain scaling for growth to continue while 'off-chain' scaling is perfected and starts to be used.
It seems to me there are just some very vocal whiners who don't want to allow any increase in the cap because they might have to ado something similar in the future. It's like they are spiting the community and network for the sake of their pride.

From my readings of publications from banks I get that they don't like btcoin, they can't control the supply of it and they can't take it away from you seem to be the two main concerns.
*But* I also haven't seen anything that bring actual benefits of blockchains without a token; so I think some sort of tokened money ust be used if they want to use blockchains (with POW &amp; decentralized) and since they don't like btc I assume they are working on creating and launching their own cryptocurrency or digital money

No one, no one, wants that. I don't know what you think but that isn't it.
Early in btc's life the community agreed the limit could be bumped against but never pressed on, those that were an early part of the community feel turned on by a small and loud group new group that doesn't seem to fully understand bitcoin or its history.
One camp wants to keep btc working like it awalys has, with a block data cap higher than normal use and not an issue to the point technology permits. 
A second group seems to want to introduce higher fees (instead of more of them) earlier than most early Bitcoiners suggested or thought necessary, they can only do this but trying to maximize the 20,000 txs/block max with the current 1 MB limit. 
No one wants centralization, that's just a silly thought and coming from a moderator here I can't say I am surprised but slightly ashamed, having been reading this subreddit a few times a day since 2012.
