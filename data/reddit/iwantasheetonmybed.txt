Hahahah, oh wait you're serious.

No you're wrong, bitcoins are not a bubble. They will rise to over $2000, I read it on the internet.

[And I say this as a sane person](

Do you have any clue what you're talking about? Have you ever done any vague form of speculation based trading before?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:37:07
Not at all, I'm completely right. I've been looking at bitcoins for over 4 weeks and during that time all they have done is rise.
Check the trends, they show that I'm right.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:22:47
It's going to definitely rise back up to $270ish and then proceed from there, probably up to $330.
My investment of $10000 a few days ago is looking great!
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:58:47
Yeah OP you're completely
fucking mad.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:01:56


No what but I have to pay my college stuff next

fuck 
that was everything what is the price

I am an expert. I invested in bitcoins yesterday and have known about them for a month, they have been rising nonstop while I have been looking and there is no doubt we will see them worth over $400 by next week.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:59:36
Yes! Bitcoins are only going up up up!
That's what I read on the internet anyway
