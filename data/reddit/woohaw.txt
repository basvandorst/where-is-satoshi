Which website do you see this on?
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:06:00
I actually just used them to send money to Mt.Gox and it was in my account within 5 minutes and the time before it was under 10 minutes. They have exceeded my expectations both times I used them, though I have never purchased bitcoins directly from them. Hopefully your issue gets resolved!
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:02:04
Do you think if I submit the bill, would I be moved to the back of the line or would it just be considered an edit?
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:51:42
Whenever I play, I'll only send myself .01 or even .001 and that will last me for at least an hour or two.
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:56:03
crud, only submitted ID
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:26:27
It seemed like there wasn't very much manipulation when there was a 5 minute delay from Mt.Gox
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:56:23
I placed my order on Sunday and still haven't received mine. I have sent 5 emails asking for updates and havent heard anything back. Getting a little worried.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:07:22
I sold as soon as soon as the clock turned and mine sold at 80
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:25:13
Great game, I love it!
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:32:52
Lol was he really judging your professionalism off of an exclamation point and smiley face?
@_date: 2013-03-23 06:51:58
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:56:54
lol all he really had to do was be semi right at least one time to get some btc from people, but he failed. Horribly.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:13:19
I think it would be a great idea if there weren't assholes in the world.
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:08:14
I mean, it says on their website that as soon as the payment clears the customer will receive their key. I understand that anything associated with bitcoins takes time, but when they don't have the decency to email a concerned customer back or list a working phone number it really irks me.
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:35:27
If he retracted the request I'm sure it was just a very sloppy mistake, but a complete disregard for your security nonetheless. You should see about speaking with someone higher up so this doesn't happen again.
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:05:51
I think he's an asshole
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:18:12
Did they respond to your emails?
@_date: 2013-03-25 12:26:35
First world problems =p
@_date: 2013-06-16 13:30:29
Well considering the fact that he copied the documents and fled to CHINA, one can probably come to the conclusion that he's sitting pretty right now from selling the documents. He's also a criminal so I have no doubt this would give the community a bad reputation
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:37:45
We only know of the documents he made public. My point is there is a lot the public still doesn't know about so until more information comes out, my coins will stay where they are
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:42:06
Scam. The dude printed out a piece of paper, tri-folded it and put primeAsic on it.. and it looks like it's in his living room. No way this is real.
@_date: 2013-03-25 11:25:35
I didn't even know those were a thing! Pretty neat
@_date: 2013-03-25 11:40:39
Then you should prolly start a new post
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:30:34
Christ, and I feel terrible after losing .05. I'm sorry :/
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:24:58
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:37:21
lol yes you would think it would be abnormal. I hope it drops a tad bit more so I can have the chance to buy in again. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:41:52
Consider yourself lucky. You still have your family, friends, a home to live in, and obviously a computer. Your life isn't bad, just learn from your mistakes.
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:42:15
Ditto. Maybe our transactions are just getting a little extra attention from the confirmation gods.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:22:53
well..  19WVMQT8oA6YU5A2ddbUAmZqRsXMzQTzVE

Personally I would have no idea how to sell information to governments, but I can guarantee someone who is a former contractor for both the CIA and NSA would have a pretty good idea. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:11:19
They added "a few" new servers, which probably means 1. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:11:05
I'm going to stop by sometime after work next week so ill be sure to take a few photos! 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:41:38
At least bitcoinity is displaying minutes instead of just seconds now so I don't have to use that math stuff
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:13:30
prove it
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:03:05
I mean I like the idea, but I check the prices from when I wake up until I go to sleep. Literally every 10 minutes. Maybe if we could customize the time that the message is sent. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:47:39
I live 15 minutes west of there. Might have to go take a little looksie poo. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:44:43
Bitinstant. You only hear about the bad experiences and they probably make up a small percentage of all their transactions. I go to walmart to send the money with a moneygram and it has always been in my mtgox account within minutes. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:37:06
I'm pretty much in the same boat except I already have a 7970 and would like to add one. You don't think it would be a good idea to add a second 7970 and resell it when my ASIC comes in? Electricity is pretty cheap in the Midwest. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:32:53
Do you know if you have to provide both the ID and bill? Or just one of them
@_date: 2013-06-01 15:55:02
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:36:54
How long does it usually take for the funds to arrive?
@_date: 2013-03-24 02:09:45
I have been mining for a few weeks now and have gotten 2 bitcoins so far with my 7970. I just added a second one that I plan on reselling after my asic comes in. It's making me money, so I figure I should just keep it running until asics ya know?
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:05:04
I have a second computer with a 6950 in it that gets about 300 mhash/s. So your xfire setup will probably be as good as a single 7970, which will be around 1.5 BTC a month. Depending on how much your electricity is it could be a nice little chunk of change.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:56:09
So is Mt. Gox not doing the 5 minute delay thingy anymore?
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:52:13
Seven for the Dwarf lords in their halls of stone... But who has the one?
@_date: 2013-06-02 14:54:17
I've never had any issues with  Bitinstant. I've used them 6 times now and the longest transfer for me was about 15 minutes. The money is usually available in a couple of minutes. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:06:52
You guys are absolutely ridiculous. They just launched their new website and you didn't expect there to be any issues? Give em a break. Regardless of what you think they are probably working their asses off and have to listen to a bunch of impatient assholes bark at them all day. You'll get your shit when all the kinks are worked out
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:29:00
They commented on every dollar because it was a milestone for bitcoins, a new high. They aren't commenting now because price drops are nothing new. It's all a part of the cycle.
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:22:50
Awesome, thanks a lot! I think it's great how you interact with the players.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:02:31
I'll have a gander
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:07:52
