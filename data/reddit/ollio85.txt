I know plenty. And yes I know crypto is 90% speculating as of now. Maybe not in 5 years.
The point I'm making about selling on a downward trend in crypto markets, is that it is fucking reckless.
It goes against every rule in investing, whether long or short term, low or high risk. 
The people in this game who take your advice will lose everything very quickly. You want good investment advice. Buy land and property. I have 2 houses. 
This is just speculation for me. I'm either going to make a million or I'm not. But it won't affect my life on the journey. But I'm not going to lose my portfolio selling on a downswing. You're fucking crazy.

         Good for you, bro.

You're too stupid to warrant any amount of effort trying to teach you the basics of investment strategy.
"Buy high, sell low" 
Keep it up, pal. You'll go far.

It has literally just recovered almost $2k in minutes.
Dunno why everyone is so worried.

There is every chance your assets will have a value of over $150k by the end of the year. Just don't worry. And don't panic sell. But it has to be said, life comes before crypto. Only invest what you can afford to lose.

So just to confirm, if we are closest, and the price of BTC hits a million this year. There will be no dick eating and you'll give us 5% of whatever you invest this year?

By the end of the year?
0.4 BTC

You just need to follow a few simple rules.
The first is that you only risk what you can afford.
And as long as you don't get emotionally attached to your investment, why would you need to sell at this point?

It really isn't. Bunch of panic merchants. It's a correction. That's.it.

Stop losses are literally the most dangerous way to deal with Cryptos.

I've heard of catching a fall in knife in terms of buying.
But catching that knife by selling with a view that it will decline further, has got to be the riskiest move you can make.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:12:51
So yeah. You only realise lost value if you sell.
Anyone selling now is a fool.

I manage my risks through a lot of research, diversification, small gains and sticking with reputable coins.
But most importantly just hodl for the fucking moon, baby.
