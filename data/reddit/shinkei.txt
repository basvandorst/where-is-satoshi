Great post. I know some companies have dividend offerings either monthly or weekly--including those traded on Havelock's site.

Existentially or practically?
Practically speaking, this is akin to forensic accounting. 
We can argue all we want about what's 'none of my business,' but if the information is out there in the blockchain or other public forums, then there is no expectation of privacy.

I'm laughing at how much people misunderstand the nature of protest and are creating a false dichotomy between the potential 'better' action these people could've taken vs. the one they did.
So first, protest is a personal action--you can feel free to criticize the destruction of public property and disturbance of the peace (i.e. riots, arson, vandalism) but in the USA you are wrong to criticize the destruction of private property or other legal 'expression' of a person's speech (1st amendment people).
Second, history has shown us that some of the most memorable forms of protest involve this kind of pseudo-violent action involving destruction of an object symbolic to the heart of the debate (i.e. flags, bras, draft cards) and so yes, it's a pretty smart protest actually.
Finally, this idea that 'oh they wasted a perfectly good phone' can easily be debunked. Think of all the CPU cycles/energy/money being wasted to mine Bitcoin that could've been donated to some hungry people/orphans with diseases/your favored cause and you suddenly realize the shamefulness of your comparison. We cannot feel guilty for the things we do when we compare it to the large world stage. If we do that, then every bite of food is a symbolic theft from those who aren't fed in some other part of the world. 
That being said, I do wholeheartedly agree with the famous ["Iron Cross"]( speech in the sense that we should feel guilty about our destructive acts in a world of those in need. But there is a balance somewhere. People have made good arguments that we live in the most peaceful, safest time in all of history. And who paid that cost?
So yes, destroying an iPhone is a form of protest that is neither 'idiotic' nor 'pointless.'

With these kinds of returns recently, it certainly seems like a very high-risk commodity.
That's one reason I am trying to find a place to use the 'capital' in a constructive way.

I mean I never liked Adrian Chen, but could he even attempt to write an article without editorializing?

Forgive my ignorance, but if he indeed has a fortune this large... wouldn't there be a wallet listed in blockchain with a balance of this much?  I mean would he have divided it among 10 or even 100 wallets?

I'm sure what he is thinking is, "the enemy of my enemy is my friend."
