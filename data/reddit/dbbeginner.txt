Got it resolved. See my reply to myself, thank you for helping though! :)

Sometime ago, I started downloading the blockchain before deleting Bitcoin, etc. So there's a stub left.
I just deleted the entire Bitcoin directory from /Users/&lt;me&gt;/Library/Application Support, and relaunched the client, still didn't get ask where i want the blockchain, and it still thinks it has some of it.
It says last block time 61, 2016, Progress 53.54%, etc, and this is after deleting the Bitcoin directory from Application Support AND emptying the trash.
Looking in other places now. 
There is no Bitcoin directory in /Library/Application Support
No Bitcoin directory in /Users/Shared/Library/Application Support
Not seeing anything in Preferences...

OK, found the directory I had previously started downloading to in ~/Documents/Blockchain Data
Once I deleted that directory, and relaunched Bitcoin, it asked where to put the chain and i was able to direct it to an external drive. That doesn't explain how the App knew the data was there when there are no preferences, and its folder in App support was deleted. 
So, making progress now, just seems like its odd behavior to remember that setting with no preference file (unless it's hidden something somewhere else). And it seems like it wouldn't be a bad idea to add "storage directory" to the GUI preferences.

I don't have an external drive at the moment. I guess I'm just going to order that 128GB SD card when I get home and then go from there... Seems like the simplest method, I had just thought/hoped I could use the storage on my network for this, but it's turning into too much of a headache!

Thanks for the research and response!
Oddly, I'm having the issue right now that I can't find the bitcoin.conf file anywhere in my filesystem. It doesn't seem to be anywhere that it says it should be under OS X

Hi can I ask you a second question?
Regarding running a pruning node, with the QT client on a mac, can I enable pruning by adding "prune=2000" to my .conf file, or is it something that can only be turned on with a command line switch, and therefore I can only launch QT from the terminal?
@_date: 2016-05-28 19:26:06
I accidentally downloaded 9GB of the blockchain, but then got the prune=2000 added, quit and relaunched Bitcoin, and immediately it pruned it down to 2 GB (plus associated files)

making a symlink to the data directory doesn't work. I might give suggestion of letting core create its directory in my home dir, then making a symlink only to the blocks directory on the remote volume, but that seems iffy. 
I'd hate to download it all, then forget to gracefully shutdown Bitcoin once when I was taking the laptop out and corrupt everything. Looks like a 128GB SD card is less than $40, so that might be the better route to take.

A) Eventually I would like to run it only as a pruning node, just connecting when I'm able. But I thought I had to download the entire blockchain first?
B) I would look into running Bitcoin directly on the NAS, but, again, the ultimate goal is to have a portable bitcoin node installation on my laptop, so that my vagrant/homestead box can connect to it.
My main issue is the fact that I have an SSD, which I love, but I don't have terribly much space available, and the upgrade cost is huge relative to the amount of extra space I would get. And knowing me, within a few weeks, all that space would be eaten up as well, and I'd be back to trying to balance things between the laptop and NAS all over again... :)

When i launch Bitcoin, and specify the remote directory, I get
"Cannot obtain a log on the data directory /Volumes/Share/Bitcoin Data Directory. Bitcoin Core is probably already running. Operation not supported".
I've manually removed the .lock file from the directory more than once (that gets created), but otherwise, no success. I am the owner of the directory and everything within.
Any ideas?
