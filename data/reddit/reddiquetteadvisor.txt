I think you're confusing propagation with mining. Propagation involves receiving the transaction over TCP, validating it against the UTXO/ECC, until all transactions in the block are received and verified, and *then* the block is broadcasted to peers. Latency, orphan transactions and conflicts (like you'd see in chainforks) make it even more likely for block propagation to be slowed by including transactions.
The more nodes that receive the attacker's block first, the increased effectiveness of the attack.
Botnet operators used to make zombies mine blocks with no transactions to increase propagation time of their blocks. This topic has been discussed on bitcointalk many times before.

Technically it does affect transaction security; I can't imagine a selfish miner has any remaining incentive to include transactions in blocks, considering the subsidy dominates them, and they increase their chances of orphaning the public chain if their blocks propagate faster.

It wouldn't result in fewer blocks being mined, however the wasted hashrate on both sides would produce an eventual public chain with a longer average time between blocks ("less blocks for the network over time"), and thus a plummet in difficulty.

Like I said, including transactions slows down block propagation and makes the attack less effective. Since right now fees make up such a tiny portion of the total reward, it makes no sense to include them.
And yes, the accepted transaction's security (namely the ECC involved) is not affected, but I'm not sure that anyone disputed that. It is dangerous, though, as the risk of a 0 confirmation attack increases. Even inadvertent double-spends will occur during a chain fork.

It is trivial for the miner to queue a transaction to be included within the next block it mines, simply by validating it and adding it to the merkle tree. Pools do this for miners.
However, when the block is actually solved, it has to be relayed to other nodes. It's not just a race to solve the block first; you need to get it in the hands of the most amount of hashrate you can, so that other miners build off of it, lest another block be solved at the same height to challenge your block to an orphan race. This is especially true with a selfish mining attack, which at various stages depends on competing with an equally sized chain.
Sending the block to another node, along with any transactions that node may not already have (including the coinbase transaction) adds latency and bandwidth and validation time to the mix. Each of those nodes needs to validate the entire data set before they will relay it to other nodes. This process is called block propagation.
Pools often have nodes (or networks of nodes) with large network visibility, so that they can propagate their blocks faster and decrease the orphan risk. A selfish miner would have to do the same thing, but because of the added complexity of performing re-orgs and deliberately orphaning chains, and the differences in transaction validity between chains assembled at different parts of the network and at different times, propagation is a very sensitive part of the attack.
A selfish miner could carefully observe these network characteristics and determine what risk including a transaction would have on the propagation time of the block vs. the fee, but I can't see them bothering for such a small amount of money *right now*. Even if they did, transactions which didn't make the risk/reward cut have their security threatened by a (perhaps inadvertent) multiple-confirmation double-spend.

The miner can ultimately demand proof from the pool, through *any* mechanism external to the blockchain if they'd like, that the pool is being honest. Just because the blockchain protocol *allows* for the pool to obscure its responsibilities doesn't mean the pool cannot issue a proof (or even a ZKP) of their honesty via another mechanism. Miners will use pools that prove they aren't cheating.
Not to mention that the real problem here is probably just cloud mining, not centralized pools.

That's not the point at all. GHash.IO can't know when they will mine 6 in a row in advance, and so it's not even remotely a concern. They *need to know in advance* in order to perform an attack. They can't just wait for it to happen.

*We* create the incentive structure for the miners, NOT the other way around. Keeping most of the previous miners happy after a PoW change is the optimal strategy. But we don't need to pity miners who don't feel like making money with the hardware they purchased. It's really not that complicated to set up a full node. If setting up a full node costs miners more than it's worth (which might be the case for some) then oh well. It's worth it to decentralize.

Blockchain.info shows how many blocks ghash.io has found in the last *n* hours, but this is a separate characteristic from hashrate. In order to pull off an attack, you MUST have more than 50% of the hashrate, not *just* be lucky enough to find 50% of the latest blocks.

It takes over a month for the attack to be profitable at that hashrate percentage in a block-subsidy-dominant environment. (The wasted hashrate will produce less blocks for the network over time, increase orphan rates and the difficulty will plummet immediately.)

It actually does matter. Transaction fees can be collected by blocks in a private chain, public blocks' rewards cannot.
Here's what happens. When the selfish miner (say, at 30% hashrate) begins selfish mining, the work done on the public chain will drop by about that much. The difficulty will also ultimately go down. Most importantly, as the attack progresses and blocks are orphaned the chain will grow slower due to the wasted work/blocks.
This means, while the amount of blocks the selfish miner obtains is higher than they should be receiving, the revenue *per hour* is far less. The mobility of transaction fees in rewards for the attack changes the incentives so that revenue per hour doesn't matter. But right now, the block reward is the vast majority of mining revenue.

You don't make any extra money from selfish mining for a month at least. The decrease in the rate of block creation as the result of the attack makes you earn less over time than if you had not attacked at all. Just because you're solving more blocks than others tend to does not mean you're making more in block rewards.
That is exactly why transaction fees affect the incentives of the attack. What, exactly, are you disputing? There's lots of literature about this attack I can point you to.
Further, losing out on those rewards for a month isn't trivial for someone with that much hashrate given the growth of the network. There are far more easier attacks on bitcoin than this which make more financial sense.
@_date: 2014-06-19 17:46:11
The attack was just overhyped. While the block reward makes up most of the mining revenue, the attack is not profitable without a miner sacrificing a month of revenue first, and the miner would need a lot of hashrate still (over 35%) for it to be feasible.
In transaction-fee dominated blocks the incentives are different and the attack is plausible.

*That's not a 51% attack.* A 51% attack means you have 100% probability of orphaning the chain no matter how many blocks are solved. You indefinitely own the chain. You are not capable of doing this with any less than 50% of the hashrate. And what you're discribing is called block withholding or even a Finney attack and the exponential cost of the attack built into proof-of-work discourages that.

This isn't serious because it's happened before and we know it will happen again. It's statistics.
Even at 20% hashrate, you will mine 6 blocks in a row with some certainty. In order for it to be a concern, the attacker must be able to anticipate when they will mine 6 blocks in a row, as you need to know in advance. They can't do that reliably without &gt; 50% hashrate, hence the name of the attack.
Just because GHash.IO mines 6 blocks doesn't mean anything. How many blocks in the last 4 days have they mined? 32% of them. They can't attack anything except 0-confirmation transactions.
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:59:07
Can I have your reasoning please: "not enough for a miner to ignore the ~$100 or $200 that the fees currently add to a block."
Including transactions decreases attack effectiveness. The attack is already sensitive enough that the optimal scenario requires complete network superiority (sybil attack). Any delay due to transaction propagation can significantly affect multiple states of the attack. For the miner, risking a payout of 25BTC is not worth $100 at some threshold.


Yes? Whenever you're dealing with re-orgs of potentially multiple consecutive blocks mined by multiple parties, you will have double-spends, even accidental ones. During last year's chainfork (due to the db bug) there was a [$10000 double-spend](

The Bitcoin wiki describes the scalability concerns in greater detail.
It is assumed that not every node will be interested in storing the blockchain, and will defer to supernodes (perhaps bitcoin payment organizations or trusted network nodes) who do store the blockchain. The merkle tree helps a node verify a transaction is part of a block without needing to download the entire block (which could be immense).
This will create a hierarchy of nodes capable of managing the blockchain, without necessarily sacrificing the computational security of the network. I'm sure whatever is implemented will be best for everybody.


Thus this is not a problem. Nodes do not need to see every recent transaction, just supernodes.

It's for CPU miners to rebel against the increased hashrate of GPU/FPGA miners by making the algorithm incompatible with those devices, but it will fall to ASIC eventually.
@_date: 2012-12-17 15:04:40


This is because there are hard-coded minimums (in the source) which can be changed softly. There is no stable market for transaction fees due to the controlled currency supply so it's necessary.


There is a strong economic disincentive to lose coins, so these growing pains you speak of will barely materialize in the market. Besides, it's becoming all the more likely that bitcoin banks and online wallets will be handling coins for users, if not also brain wallets which can only be misplaced through a lapse in memory.
It's also difficult to objectively determine whether coins are lost or not. Sure, individuals could send the coins to themselves to prove stake, but some outputs may appear lost but actually must be redeemed in some way to fulfill an external contractual obligation that the software cannot resolve on its own. M to N transactions also do not seem to fit within the recycled coins worldview you suggest.
Indeed you could construct scripts which appear to (potentially) entrench the spending of the output, avoiding the transaction fee necessary to renew stake in the coins. At that point, why wouldn't everybody do it to avoid losing their coins permanently? What about a person that awakes from a coma to discover their brain wallet has been lost to wealth redistribution? There's hardly any security or sense in recycling coins.

Why do people think we need to recycle coins that haven't been spent in a while? It just increases the value of the rest of the coins at the financial expense of the holder. The supply is divisible by up to 8 decimal places.
Nevertheless, a Bitcoin "contract" preserving certain characteristics of the currency is just an overly explicit way of advocating against a hard fork. It seems silly and unnecessary.

The storage effects of 20 or 30 years worth of wasted outputs are far eclipsed by the effects of a successful Bitcoin, i.e. one that handles as many transactions per second as Visa. You would gain almost nothing from recycling those old outputs compared to the massive amount of outputs involved in active transactions.
**By the way, miners do not need to store anything.** You only need a merkle root to mine a block, which can be provided to you by a mining pool. Pools are much less of a danger of being centralized; if a pool became rogue miners could switch from it effortlessly. In fact, miners have an incentive to distribute their hashrate among as many pools as they can.
I also explained [here]( how it's difficult to assess whether the coins are truly lost and retain the flexibility of scripts.

It forks when some users accept a block, and some users don't. Because blocks build on previous blocks (and only blocks clients believe are valid) the chains split off.
In the case of the last fork, because 0.7 was exclusive of blocks, miners downgraded to it to make the 0.7 chain longer, forcing 0.8 nodes to recognize it as the best chain.
Forks are not always bad, because they *can* be indicative of a security attack your client has recognized. Preventing unwanted forks simply means fixing and avoiding bugs in the Bitcoin code.

* A single 51% attack could mean the end of the currency, making all coins instantaneously worthless.
* Mining is currently incentivized by an arbitrary reward. Once transaction fees take over, there's no reason to believe the incentive will be large enough to defend network security.
* Costs of being a full node will rise in the future as transaction rates increase, as blocks become larger and relaying blocks to earn rewards becomes difficult. Even with optimizations, it's possible that blocks will be orphaned more often, or the cost of network attack decreased.
* Lack of zero-confirmation security means merchants must wait to trust that they've received payment. 3rd party services will need to fill this need for bitcoin.
The best thing Bitcoin has going for it is the ability to fix or change all of the above, with thorough consensus and clever developers. That's why my bets are on Bitcoin. But EFF is right to be a bit skeptical about it.

You would have to sustain the DDoS long enough to change the difficulty. And solo-mining operations don't need any more than a dial-up connection to mine if they need to, though it's bad for the network as they won't be verifying as many transactions.
Though I agree it would be easier for the government to just take over these large companies and attack bitcoin that way. Good thing they're all selling hashrate and getting it distributed around the world as fast as possible.

Some miners may deliberately not mine transactions at all. The blocks they produce are smaller and relay through the network faster (less likely to be orphaned) and they don't need to sit on the network listening/verifying transactions. Transaction fees are the only thing which can discourage this behavior.

* About ~163962 shares will be paid back to 0.1 in dividends before the other shares receive dividends (early return).
* Right now hashrate is upwards of 5TH, but deployment of 7 more TH is likely in the next two weeks. Deployment of an additional 50TH is somewhat likely next month.
* BFL/Avalon are selling much more efficient boards, so depending on their rollout rate, ASICMINER could ultimately lag behind in node size. But production rate is unrivaled.

It's not as cut and dry as you think. Bitcoins are not physical property and participating in the currency requires only sending or receiving data -- it doesn't require contracts, and it's not enforced by court authority or law. Banning Bitcoins or the outright ban of their ownership would be concerning for free speech, as it is much like a "point system" that a consensus of its participants have agreed to the nature of.
If the government could ban Bitcoin, it would take the commerce clause much further than ever before. But this is just my distant perspective.

If friedcat made it too cheap too fast, I would be concerned. It would trigger a fierce price war when a lot of revenue can still be made for a couple months.

Essentially, everybody (who is mining) is competing to create a hash that starts with a certain minimum of zeros. The hash is of a block header, which references the previous block and the contents of the block. Given enough computing power, there's a certain probability for finding a hash that starts with 1 zero, 2 zeros, etc..
The minimum amount of zeros changes every 2016 blocks such that the average time between blocks is 10 minutes. (A timestamp field also is in the block header.)
Why are people competing to find these hashes? It's a good objective way of ordering transactions in the ledger. Transactions cannot just be added to a list that everyone magically agrees to. The dynamic difficulty of adding a block to the chain helps prevent spam, double-spending, etc.. In effect, miners are protecting the network. In return they're given coins (slightly devaluing everyone else's coins in the process).
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:20:58
Yes, they need external funding to spend the coins, which makes them uneconomical (you will not ever spend them unless they're colored coins or something, which is not the case now). The fees are worth more than the coins themselves. There's zero incentive to spend it, and thus every single one of the transactions is an eternal waste of space on everybody's hard disk. The fact such a huge portion of the UTXO set is filled with these outputs is worrying.

Right. I guess that makes them both creators and discoverers depending on the software's condition for rewarding coins.
@_date: 2013-08-19 20:04:20
The amount of bitcoins to be created is pre-ordained by software.
The bitcoins to be rewarded on block  25BTC
The bitcoins to be rewarded on block  12.5BTC
This cannot be changed. Thus, they have already been created, they just haven't been serviced to the network yet. The software has implemented conditions on its release which are immutable.
edit: when you think about it a bit deeper, there's all sorts of interesting questions that arise. For instance, what if you don't know the amount in advance? I'd wager it's still being discovered, because the software's conditions are still immutable and the coins still derive from the result of that software. It is not being created by someone's discretion.
But what if an entity had an incalculable amount of hashrate? Would they be creating bitcoins? Because they, in effect, have sole discretion of when they are issued by the network.
Thus I'm starting to think it makes more sense to consider miners creators and not discoverers, it is their conscious effort that issues the currency. If everybody stopped mining right now, nothing would be created.

Beneath the hologram seal is a private key. You can scan it with an app like the Bitcoin for Android app, which imports the address (and its public key) into your wallet for spending. The seal is tamper-proof.
Exposed is the public key (the *address* related to the private key) which you can use to fund the card. You can check the balance of the card with that public key. If you unseal the private key, you know you are the only person to have seen the private key and have access to the coins, which gives the cards their value.
This is something which is not possible to do with any other financial instrument. The only weak link here is the creators of the card could keep a record of the private keys and steal the bitcoins after they go out of business or something. But if you trust that they were careful and deliberately secure (I do, because they have a long term financial incentive) then you can trust these cards.
Cascacius coins are the same thing but coins instead of cards. I think the cards are really awesome -- they're cheaper and just as secure.

Great news.
What's really great about 135/65/55nm node sizes is it's possible to mass-manufacture hashrate on these big node sizes far faster than *current* 20-30nm fabrication pipelines, even considering a 100x difference of efficiency. TSMC can fulfill massive quantities of chips at 65/55nm, which ASICMINER should be taping out at in a couple months, just in time.

The fees cannot be set correctly. Every single idea people have come up with is possible to game with a small amount of hashpower, with a large amount of bitcoins, or a little of both. There is no easy way to dynamically change the fees. Maybe there will be in the future, but there is nothing now.
This dust limit is flexible, you can set it to whatever you want as a miner/node for relaying and memory pool purposes. In the future the dust limit can be set to whatever interesting idea someone comes up with based on what's actually getting into blocks. But those ideas haven't been ironed out yet. This change is a framework for future changes.
As gavin explains:


@_date: 2013-03-16 23:16:06
You can learn pretty much everything you need to know [here](
* tx is shorthand for transaction
* when you receive a transaction your client may relay it to other nodes, but it'll ask them if they have it first to avoid wasting bandwidth
* when you receive a block, same thing happens
* nodes will occasionally give you new IPs for you to record
* blocks form a blockchain, setting the best chain can involve a change in your wallet balance, which requires a sync/flush/whatever
* versions are sent during handshakes or when your height changes
I have a feeling you're doing it for research purposes in which case you're going to want to take a look at the source...

Peter Todd et al. want the blocksize to stay where it is to further their belief in off-chain transactions. Gavin doesn't want to sacrifice the current usability of the currency for future off-chain transactions which haven't been developed yet. The way I see it, Peter or one of his friends wants to make a ledger service and knows these changes will make them uneconomical for some time.
It's not that Gavin ever had a problem with off-chain anything... he just doesn't want those undeveloped ideas holding back important changes.

If you look at the original Bitcoin whitepaper, there is a formula. ([See 11. Calculations](
     &lt;math.h&gt;
    double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)
    {
       double p = 1.0 - q;
       double lambda = z * (q / p);
       double sum = 1.0;
       int i, k;
       for (k = 0; k &lt;= z; k++)
       {
          double poisson = exp(-lambda);
          for (i = 1; i &lt;= k; i++)
             poisson *= lambda / i;
             sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));
       }
       return sum;
    }
z is the amount of confirmations, q is the percentage computing power smaller than 0.5

Somebody can still force or trick you into sending payments from an address multiple times.
* Say somebody sends you a shitload of 0.0005 BTC outputs. Once you try to spend the coins you received on the address, you will hit the transaction size limit or the vin length limit, forcing you to sign a different transaction to get the rest.
* or if you received multiple transactions and spent only a fraction of them, one or more of the unspent outputs would not be directed into a change address forcing you to sign for them again later.
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:33:42
That's not true...
You have the block header, which contains:
1. how many transactions exist in the tree
2. merkle root
You can then select a random subset of the leaves of the tree, knowing exactly how much depth you need to read, in order to verify they are valid. All you need now are the transactions referenced in the txin's, which you can easily get from any other node. You don't need to see every transaction, just *those*. And other nodes can prove they existed in the blockchain at an earlier height.
You cannot fully validate a block, especially the coinbase transaction, but that's not what I'm talking about. It's been suggested that the merkle tree should also contain the values for easy lookup and verification, which would make verifying the coinbase transaction easier.
Hell, I could do this right now right in front of you.
Block at latest height:
Let's say my random subset is just one transaction, this one:
Is it valid?




We'll need to grab the prevouts...
Inputs valid, scripts check out! How do we know they were in the blockchain before??
They were included in

They're using the same company everyone else does.
That applies to Avalon, ASICMINER, KnCMiner and probably others as well.
I just doubt they can get 28nm production capabilities from TSMC so quickly... fabrication at that scale is in high demand and very expensive to do mass production. Unless they already had the contracts paid for and settled months ago, before pre-orders. It costs a lot to design 28nm, and takes a long time especially for high heat density things like mining devices to get them simulated, test runs, etc.
However, this orsoc has an okay reputation so it's possible they won't have a problem with it. Maybe I'm underestimating them.
September just doesn't sound realistic though.

There have actually been studies of the economic activity on the silk road. I think now bitpay handles more in a month than Silk Road processed in a year but I'd have to look for those statistics again.
People who try to manipulate the price by selling are not manipulating at all. They're selling at a certain market price. It's a process called price discovery. They're going to have a bad time if they think they can predict what the market will do as a result of their selloffs.
The only sure way to 'manipulate' the price is to attack services and buy bitcoins when the price drops as a result, like DDoS attacks.
edit: Also, while the risk is shifted to the consumer, the consumer should be practicing care in who they purchase goods from. There's a reputational risk to the merchant, or at the very least an incentive. Part of the baggage of bitcoin being a global currency is that it forms a global economy, all commerce could potentially be fraudulent.
@_date: 2013-07-08 05:22:19




The price is unstable, because the market is constantly changing and we lack the liquidity of more mature financial instruments, but this doesn't matter to a merchant who uses bitpay or coinbase, since they convert the BTC to USD immediately. It's zero risk. There isn't even chargeback risk like with PayPal.

That's a true, but separate concern. However, did you really expect in the future that every Bitcoin node is going to be processing 2000 transactions per second? Privacy cannot scale without trust: that is, you will need to use an external service to keep track of your bitcoin balance -- a service which stores the full blockchain.
Our goal is to reduce the cost of participating in validation of the network for security purposes, which bloom filters accomplish.

No, fees float. Fees are considered all leftover value that is not claimed by an output in a transaction, so if you mess up when manually building one you will accidentally send more in fees to the miner than you intended.
Fees float because higher fees increase the incentive to confirm the transaction faster. Eventually fees will make the bulk of a miner's profits. Unlike merely accidentally sending someone money, you are quite literally paying for a service. It is not fraud to keep what you make in transaction fees.
If you're building software you should test it on testnet to avoid losing bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-29 22:05:02

If you had an infinite amount of hashrate you could solve 1000000 blocks right now. The timestamps are only used to coordinate the difficulty adjustments. Nodes also try not to relay blocks outside of some threshold. Those don't matter if the difficulty doesn't impact your capability to solve blocks.
By the way, there are things like the [time warp attack]( Timestamps are not reliable in bitcoin in the presence of a 51% attack.

Ever heard of bloom filters? They've already been implemented into Bitcoin. You can take a random subset of all transactions (which consists of transactions you're interested in) and validate/store those. If every node had some more or less storage space or bandwidth they could adjust how much validation/storage they can provide the network, allowing it to scale just fine without any centralization.
What cannot scale right now (as far as we know) is a way to isolate the cost of propagating a transaction. This changes and is highly dynamic and no models have been put forth which allow it to adjust automatically and not be gamed by some sort of Sybil attack.

Well, specifically a fraud proof that isn't identified by everyone else, but is valid because of a bug in the fraud proof code. All you've demonstrated is that it isn't a good idea *now*, while Bitcoin is still being developed. I agree. But it's the perfect solution for distributing full validation of the blocks.
I find it incredibly unlikely an arbitrary re-org would be possible without a bug in the proof code. All you need is *one* fully validating node to prove to all other nodes invalidity, not to mention a large number of probabilistically validating nodes.

I think I may vote for **Joerg Platzer**. The guy did fantastic work in Berlin practically creating the first local bitcoin economy so he would be a perfect candidate for the foundation. He also understands crypto-politics very well.
I especially like that he's focused not solely on how the foundation will interact and achieve its goals, but to act as a counter-balance to prevent U.S. businesses from co-opting the currency. We're seeing a lot of U.S. businesses enter this space and absorb the liquidity and financial infrastructure; this gives the U.S. tools to achieve economic balkinization which will stunt growth by welding technical decisions with political decisions.
At the same time, **Elizabeth Ploshay** has great lobbying experience and could be a valuable resource for the foundation. First impressions do matter, and if bitcoin stumbles today it may be more difficult to navigate its future. My only problem with her is she doesn't have much experience in the community; though, like me, she only jumped into bitcoin because she saw something wonderful and exciting. She would also help a lot with public experiences, PR, education, etc. which the other candidates don't seem to be capable of doing aside from Trace Mayer of course.

It is a market, but it sets a cost for network attack in relation to the volume of commerce. Why is 25BTC per block enough to secure the network today?

Yup! It just turns the cards (which aren't unsealed) into physical assets which are pegged to bitcoin's value. Anyone who receives the card can (and should) trade it again, as long as they don't unseal it.

Personally, I think the best way to "explain" bitcoin is to describe its construction from scratch. If you had a video which went through the entire concept from start to finish, at least the more interested types would be curious enough to sit through it.
You could start by describing a 2-peer currency where only simple transactions &lt;to,from,value&gt; occur, and both nodes have the same copy of the balance sheet. Transactions are sent back and forth to reflect changes (deltas) in the balance sheet.
* If we want to let an unknown number of nodes connect, we need transactions to propagate. **So, transactions need to be relayed.**
* Well, now if you wanted you could claim to have sent value from one account to another without having authorized it. **So, transactions need to be authenticated using public key cryptography.**
* Well, now if you wanted you could double-spend transactions. Or, what happens if you temporarily disconnect and nodes disagree about the order of transactions? Who do you trust? We need to chain transactions together to agree on the order, **so we'll use a linked list type structure and hash functions to prove integrity.**
* Well, now you could just spam the network with transactions. Also, what if two chains exist with the same length? Which one do you pick? **Now we need a proof-of-work structure to make it 'difficult' to append to the chain.**
* Well, now you could just amass enough computing power to defeat the spam protection. **So, we need to adjust difficulty to reflect the transaction rate.**
* Well, now the transaction rate is capped. Also, every participant needs a larger amount of computing power as the network grows. **So, now we need to bundle transactions into blocks which are chained in the same way**, and make the difficulty adjust so that on average a block occurs every 10 minutes. We can make the difficulty adjustment take place every two weeks.
* Well, now miners exist, but what incentive do they have to participate other than to apply their own transactions? **Now we can allow for transaction fees and a controlled currency supply** to incentivize competition and increased computing power.
* Well, now that exists, but now nodes need the entire balance sheet to verify a transaction. **So, we allow for arbitrary inputs/outputs which are 'spent' and ditch the balance sheet.** We can use the UTXO set as the "balance sheet", but nodes only need references to txin's in order to verify a transaction.
* Well, now transactions are fungible, but how do we create more advanced authentication mechanisms? We can abstract the authentication into a turing-incomplete scripting system and embed the signature checking into that. Then, later we can add functions and maintain reverse compatibility.
Otherwise if you tell a noob "blocks", "blockchain" etc. they just think it's a bunch of arbitrary terms. Why does it work this way as opposed to any other way? Why a controlled currency supply? etc.

Not really. Keeping the public key hidden under a hash is mainly to cut down on transaction size. It also makes QR codes smaller, and of course addresses themselves. ;)
This particular flaw might be exploitable after multiple transactions have taken place (as is its nature), but a separate public key flaw may be exploitable with only one transaction. If you intercept the transaction and, say, increase the miner fee and change the output address, you could hijack a transaction before it enters the blockchain if you have discovered some incredibly unlikely flaw in ECDSA.
Hiding public keys behind hashes to cover up bad implementations of cryptosystems actually sounds worse than letting those signature flaws get exploited sooner.

Oh. Good distinction.

coinbase already has supply problems during volatility, look up the complaints on this subreddit from the bubble and just recently. I'm rooting for them but until the exchange market is more liquid instant BTC transfers may not survive huge volume spikes.
