Upboat, although I didn't get it nearly as bad as you.
I will repaste my issue.
MoneyGram'd $150 at $75 a coin and got 1.2 BTC instead of 2.0 BTC after an 5+ hour delay.

I learned the hard way that doing direct to address instead of Mt. Gox just lets them jack you :(
Update:  Charlie made me whole again.  I emailed him after I exhausted all support options.  Please exhaust all your support options before you email him, but if you already have it is worth a try.  He's a stand up guy.

I did get it eventually but it took a couple of months and a whole bunch of hassling them in public places (bitcointalk, reddit, etc.).  I never did business with them again.  If it has been 4 months then I would definitely file the complaint.

I ordered a Kookaburra on April 3rd and it is still processing.  I emailed their customer support and they just said there's a big backlog.
I ordered a Silver Eagle from Amagi Metals on the 10th and already have received it.  I also have 3 more orders from Amagi that should be coming next week.

Do NOT use the direct to wallet option.
If you think that premium was bad it is much much worse if the price is fluctuating and/or there is Gox lag.
Support would not help me on this.  I had to email the CEO and he credited me the difference.
Always use deposit to Mt. Gox or another exchange so you have control over when you buy and avoid the nasty hidden premiums and delays.
BitInstant should remove the direct to wallet feature OR disclose the premiums and exactly how much BTC you will receive on the quote.

There's a pretty big premium on direct to wallet.  There's a ton of info we have been able to piece together on other threads if you check my post history.
In a nutshell you will pay a premium much larger than what you would pay if you just deposited the cash and paid the exchange fee then withdrew.
Perhaps I was a bit hasty saying they should remove the feature since it is tougher to be completely anonymous when using an exchange.  However BitInstant should definitely be disclosing all the fees and premiums and how much BTC you will receive.

For the future you may have heard of this company but for Bitcoin to metals Amagi Metals has never done me wrong.  I have ordered probably 20oz of silver and a couple 1/10th oz gold coins from them.  Their shipping is very cheap and the prices are the best I've found.
I used my affiliate link but I have no affiliation with them other than a happy customer and you can cut it out if you'd like.

Ahh yes I also had trouble with them long ago when I ordered a Kookaburra.  This can definitely be used for any online company that is refusing refunds and not shipping products.  Best of luck to you!

Exactly the same for me.  I submitted my ticket Friday and have heard no response so far.  I attempted to contact them in the Bitcointalk newbie support thread and they told me to make a ticket.  I told them I submitted it Friday and they said they have a "support back log" (quite the understatement)

I have the iPhone 5 (not the S) and I got the same error on my first attempt at logging in.  Very weird.

Irreversible transactions are an incredibly important part of Bitcoin and it protects businesses against fraud and chargebacks.  All online businesses should be accepting it just for that reason alone.  It is free from issuance and abuse of central governments.
What we are talking about here is something else.  If a business is operating illegally by not shipping products and refusing refunds then they should be held accountable.
Bitcoin is an incredible currency and tool but don't confuse that with a license to commit widescale fraud against consumers.  That is not okay with Bitcoin, fiat, barter, or anything else in any country.

This happened to me and I got absolutely murdered.  No response from support.

Will do.
Update:  They shipped this on Monday.  I should receive it this week.  I will update when I receive it.

Yes, you receive cash in your Mt. Gox which you can buy BTC immediately and withdraw.  If the exchange rate changed while your funds were being deposited or there were any delays you can wait for a better price.
You don't have to be verified to use Mt. Gox with a cash deposit so if you want to get the most BTC for your money I recommend this method.
