According to  you'll be waiting 30 minutes to infinity minutes.  I lean toward the latter.

So is Bitcoin,  but at least XRP is functional.

If Bitcoin continues to be nonfunctional we can safely assume it will be under $1000 in 2018.

Thanks a bunch man, I was hoping that was the case.  But now the next question is, if I pay a whole buck for fees, shouldn't it be processed in 24 hours?  I understand that the low fee transactions can get stuck for a while during busy times, but at the time I made the transaction that $0.94 was over a buck.
Edit:  I don't know if one of you helpful bitcoiners did something, but well after a day of waiting I just saw the first confirmation show up.  Go figure.

Blockchain.info does calculate the appropriate fee, or so they say—and once they tell me what fee I should pay I multiply it by three or four it just to be safe, because I'd like to see my transaction happen in a few hours.  
Apparently I should have multiplied it by ten or twenty instead.

So weird, it's been stuck for at least a day (2 days?) and as soon as I post about it things start moving.  Anyhow, knock on wood—thanks.

Private key?  It's a web wallet, I don't know anything about a private key.
I do have that giant phrase of nonsense words, "flood simply surround sunburned freeze minivans... etc" that they told me to print out when I made the account. I didn't actually print it out, it's on my desktop in a file. 
So who has the private key, blockchain.info?  Nobody at all?
Anyhow thanks for saying something.

Will do, and thanks so much!!!

I don't think you're listening to my story.  Somebody said "I want to send you bitcoins", I replied "Sure thing man, you have my address, send it."
I did not know at the time that blockchain.info was breaking the link between wallets and addresses.  So he sent the funds to an address which has become "decoupled" (for lack of a better term) from my web wallet.  So I can see the wallet floating out there, I can see my money on it, but how to get to it? I suppose only blockchain.info knows for sure.  They maintain private keys to all their web wallets, right?  I guess it's their bitcoin now.
I really don't care anymore.  I've come to the conclusion t's not worth the fucking hassle to use bitcoin.  The next time somebody says "want me to pay you money in a month or bitcoin right now?" I will be intelligent and say "I'll take real money later!"
