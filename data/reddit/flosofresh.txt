The wait while the BTC stays at a stagnate level is the best time to come to this thread. Predictions and arguments about said predictions are the purest form of cringy entertainment.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:57:23
Here are recent stats, from the past 4 weeks trend. 
THU to FRI, average **117 gain**.  
FRI to SAT average **-261 drop**. 
SAT to SUN, average **291 gain**.  
When people speak of the weekend dip, we need to understand and keep in mind, that late Saturday, early Sunday morning is typically our lowest point, but the price typically recovers and has actually improved between Thursday 5pm to Sunday 5pm. We have averaged **147 gain**  
Per usual, this is not trading advice to anybody, I'm just trying to adjust to trends, post 11k.

Interesting, I have square cash but I'm not sure if I can just use it, or if I have to convert the BTC to cash before I use it.

1) Do you think BTC will break 15k within 1 year from today?
2) Do you think BTC will drop below 1k within 1 year from today?
3) Do you think BTC will break 30k within 2 years from today?
4) What do you think will be the Low and High for 2018?

I bought bitcoin for breakfast. Love starting a day with a low price. Cheers
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:27:52
My gut tells me we never see &lt;4k again. The world saw it hit 20k less than 3 months ago, lol. Possibility of 5x your investment... how many people in America alone play the lottery? At 4k, your odds of making money seem inevitable, therefore, I'm not expecting to see it. I know nothing, but I truly believe that 7 will be your new floor and rarely happen in the next year. Just stating an opinion for "I told you so" conversations later on. Plus, all these moody hell and damnation predictions are bummin me out, lol

The best advice you will ever hear is make sure its money you are willing to lose every cent of. Most people have enough of a concious to not give trading advice because the market is totally unpredictable. Taking a look at charts and deciding for yourself is the only real way to go. Crypto Bobby is a cool guy to follow and has some i sightful advice, he also answers live questions on his youtube channel

The last 2 dips under 8k didn't last longer than 24hrs. Too juicy of a price to pass up.
See you doom and gloom dudes later, I'm gonna catch up with the astronauts on Tuesday afternoon.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:12:13
I was being sarcastic, boys.
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:34:35
How much lower will it get?
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:39:04
Totally see where you are coming from. Like I said, it's just an opinion from an optimist, not advice to anyone.
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:36:50
We've barely had a 300 spread in the last 24hrs. How does somebody get burned day trading when nobody is buying and nothing is moving?
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:44:06
Day and night from the predictive posts last night, lol. Doom and Gloom to Gleeful Optimism.

Thank you. I'll check these out.

Couldn't agree more. Much better for long term investment as well.
@_date: 2018-03-24 02:44:18
I think we are still too high to buy. I'm expecting $8,400 by 5pm tomorrow with a low of around $8,100 in the very early sunday morning. This is a biased opinion from a guy who sold at $8,989 and is still holding off on buying back until it drops.
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:33:25
I like where your heads at. I'll buy
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:28:24
On a positive note. I brought my BEP to $8,850 today.

I'm curious as to the average age of a r/bitcoin user. The level of aggression to posts in a discussion thread is hilarious. This daily discussion thread has made the subscription to r/Bitcoin totally worth it. Cheers
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:11:07
I bought, my logic being...
600 in 14 hours was a big dip when we hadn't seen more than 300 movement in a 24 hour period in over a week. I think this market is really starting to stabilize. The lower in price we get, the less likely a 1000 dip day is, IMO. A trader looking for a 3-7% flip can pretty well assume we will see 8,600 again in the next week.
Of course it could totally go lower before it raises again, but after 600 dip, I think it is more likely we hit our recently common 8,500 mark, than dipping &gt;800. People are buying in the 7's at mass so it doesn't stick for long. I'm selling and making money as soon as I see $8,600 again.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:51:39
Does anybody know of some good articles/tutorials for trading over $10,000? I'm also getting eaten alive on fees/market markup as my investment grows. It's possible this is normal but the market sits at $8,050 and I buy coin at an exchange rate of $8,200. I'm going to hit the Coinbase and Squarecash weekly buy limit at 10k very soon. Any thread or article to help guide me through not shooting myself in the foot would be appreciated
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:10:31
Patience paid off for those of us who held off on a $8,350 buy back yesterday. Trust your gut, ignore your nerves. I say this and watch it drop another 500 out of nowhere, I will be eating shit for buying back too early. Where's Goldbergger? I need affirmation
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:46:22
I passed on buying at 8200 this morning because I was sure I would see 8k again by lunch. Surely we will see under 8k again by the end of the weekend, right?
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:44:57
Out of curiousity, what are your BEP's at? (I'm at $8,147.30 for BTC)
@_date: 2018-03-25 01:42:40
If you are trading "a couple bitcoins", that is far too much money be taking advice from users on this discussion thread. No offense to any of us, lol

Low saturday dip, translating to a low Sunday-Pumpday and another 24-48hrs in the "8500 abyss". Strap in for a slow start to the week

Do you truly believe it will never get back &gt;$8,500?
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:07:07
Thanks, fuck day day trading, then
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:03:17
So if you are long term, and its lower than a price that most assume is still coming, where is the imminent regret?
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:52:27
Thank God somebody around here knows where the bottom is
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:52:33
Noob tax question. I'm at $9,069 for a break even price. If it gets back up to $9,500 and I sell high, then buy back when it hits $8,400, do I need to factor in paying taxes on the ammount that I sold for at $9,500?
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:13:30
It seems to me to be getting more and more stable with every week. Im confused by what you are saying. Bitcoin is in a loose &lt;2k spread for day traders and hodlers have seen the drop finally slow down. It really looks like 7k will be the new 1k for a while. I, for one, am not angry with you at all. There is money to be made my bag gets heavier every week.
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:06:30
I was late to the party so selfishly, I'd like to see it keep this "11k to 8k" pace for a couple months. Need to pocket more than the .109 coins I'm at. After the general public seeing it get so high, I don't see the community allowing it to drop below 7 for more than a couple hours. The price has been all over, but pretty protected by buyers when it gets around 7. Then again, I know nothing, and I'm not a trader, just thought bitcoin would be an exciting way to save disposable income. Supporting the cause.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:11:49
Update, I didn't realize the USD Wallet on coinbase has $100,000 limit, that will suffice for a long time. Seems like fees are hard to avoid when dealing with large amounts.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:46:35
Yesterday was refreshing. Being a part of Bitcoin has been exhilarating. I'm fortunate to have a disposable income to play with, and the patience to slow play my buys. Hats off to the day traders, I can only imagine the type of anxiety highs/lows that would bring. Cheers to good week with at least one good dip for a guy who needs to make his weekly buy.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:41:08
Coming from the perspective of someone who DID buy at $7,600, I still would selfishly like him to be correct. This is only because I sold at $8,989, and want it to drop back down before I buy back in. Not everybody who is hoping for a dip missed out on a buy. Ja Feel?
EDIT- I double checking, I actually bought at $7,790

So I pay 25% of my profit from original investement. I was under the impression I would be taxed on the entirety, including what I initially invested. Made me curious how day traders could ever make a profit. Thank you for the help

That was an eventful 50 minute commute to work. Don't trade and drive. Unless the market is doing THIS

Squarecash. You have to transfer it to cash first, but I have a physical card and the tranfer is instant.
