I guess he means more expensive fees

Is this a joke ??? Cryto-currencies are supposed to free us from government. And you guys are crying and threatening of lawsuit.

Probably Tethers

This is an attack on Bitcoin. How dare he uses our name ?
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:22:41
And wait 24 hours

Sounds familiar

A sheppard, that sounds like he's herding sheeps

They can fork however they want and use the name that pleases them, why is that an issue ? 
The small-blockers and big-blockers couldn’t be reconciled so they splitted. Why do you think one ideology deserves the bitcoin brand and not the other ?
In any case, people can whine forever, the market decides. And that means new entrants.

Blaming the disfunctioning banking system. You sounds like MtGox

Wishing ill to buy more is the perfect example of bubble mentality. I sense it might be time to get out or buy alts.

Yep. If you look at  whatam8 is keeping slow-mobius threads alive. Suspicious. People be safe with your money. Lots of bad people out there who may take advantage of your gentleness.

You should keep your BTC balance secret and not shout it on reddit

I would hold if I were you. You don’t place all your eggs in the same basket.

It seems that the attacker has to lock funds for a certain period with this attack. It’s an opportunity cost like locking funds for PoS

With lightning you don’t have to open a channel with every person you want to transact with. Think of it as cash that you put in your Wallet. It’s less secure but all the money that you committed can be spend without any fees.

The poll is a joke. There are only 300 people that answered your poll; and you have no idea of how much bitcoin they own. 
Seems presumptuous to assume “clear indication of lack of support”.
PoW solves that problem and it means miners decide.

Amazon is never going to accept BTC with the current scaling. A few months back it costed more than 10$ for a single transaction

Free speech sould go hand in hand with decentralization

According to the article, the Chinese exchanges themselves will not be able to operate at all. How is it harder to create an account if you already found a way to go around the great firewall...

Dude, we know quantum computer can ruin bitcoin’s security. It’s not a concern because we’re still years behind that.
How is that different from an ASIC resistant scheme that will last several years ?

Apple manufactures their transistors.
