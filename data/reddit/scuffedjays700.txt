High frequency trading happens on every high volume exchange. You used to have morons who thought they knew about trading talking about walls on here. Those "walls" don't really exist they are just computers knowing if you buy X at that price in bulk from the wall, the computer will be able to make X by buying up all the lower cost coins and some high cost coins. Same goes for selling just reverse what was said. Those walls disappear once all the lower cost coins is bought and if you buy from the wall they buy up the lower cost coins. It is impossible to buy the wall and buy the lower cost coins.  High frequency trading functions the sameway  whether it is stocks or cryptocurrency.

Not buying the story. I heard about people doing this but doing that much money doesn't happen quickly like he is saying. Could of happened but just not  buying it. 99%+ of people who trade currencies lose all their money. Most currency trading is a 0 sum game because the currency market doesn't move fast enough. Now to cryptocurrency the margins are similar to stock because the amount of money that is coming in. Which makes it not a zero sum game. The biggest problem with day trading is high frequency traders own humans as a whole there are some humans who are lucky or great at trading who knows which one it is.

Just stop if you mined bitcoin in 2009. Your average desktop at the time was getting over 1000 BTC a day. So unless you mined for less than 20 minutes which means you got everything set up which took awhile and then quit. The story did not happen. Participating in a bitcoin faucet in 2010 would of got you more than 2 bitcoins.

Bitcoin is 14k the max accepted rate for bitcoin is 5 million that includes there are no other alternative forms of currency that have much value which will take decades and probably will never happen. In that scenario you only 416 times X (amount you purchased). In your case that is $416,000. In a more realistic scenario you buy at 12k goes to a million in 10 years you have $83,000 (83 times your principle).
Is it worth it? Not really you can get a good job and earn more in a year. You have to work or get in on the ground floor of something to become rich off of nothing. The ground floor of bitcoin was 2009-2012. If you invested a $100 in the ICO for  IOTA in December  2015 you would have over 10 million dollars. Invest  when you have money.

Not really how shorting or a put option work. If shorting and bit coin doubles in price and then goes to 0 you lose all your money. You can replace double with triple... it will eventually get called in. With put options you pay a massive premium for the further out the option is.  If you have a put option that requires 20% for a year to have that option meaning bitcoin needs to fall further than 13000 otherwise you lose money on the amount you bought the put option on. The closer the option is the less you pay. There are people who shorted the housing bubble and lost money because the bubble didn't burst.

The way it works there are coins under the 1000 BTC for sale at a worse price. So if you buy from the 1000 BTC stack just at a worse price which makes no sense. Now let's say you want to buy all the coins under then buy the 1000 coins. It will never happen because you either will buy the 1000 coins first which the bot will buy the coins under the price or you buy the coins under 1000 BTC  order which the bot cancels then lists them for a higher price. What these bots know is the price they could sell all 1000 BTC and buy the ones under it plus some above to where it always makes a profit with its algorithm. So at the end of the day if you buy that 1000 BTC you are always paying a premium. Essentially  it would be the same as you going to grocery store wanting 2,000 bananas they have 1000 bananas for $500 the guy tells you he can sell you 2,000 bananas for $1200, but will not sell you just 1000. You can pay the $1200 and not do any more work/driving or you could buy 1000 then find another 1000 at another store.

Yes we are talking about a single order. That is how exchanges work in 2017. The reason exchanges work that way in 2017 it benefits the exchange (higher volume = more money ), benefits all major corporations in finance (makes money off of the bots), benefits daytrading major funds if they are smart because it creates a lower buying price since they know what they are doing, benefits major corporations in finance with dark markets,  increases the public's trust in the market because it decreases the amount of time the market dips and lastly liquidity which most Ivy league economics and finance graduates will point to as the biggest help. Whether the last one is true or not is debatable
The disadvantages  are it can cause a market to collapse (has never happened but a small possibility), disadvantages all small traders, disadvantages people who have bad money managers like pension fund managers, and when the general public finds things like this out they say the exchanges/market are rigged which creates a distrust.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:12:24


China, Japan, and South Korea basically Asian countries are the reason for the massive increase. People hope that South American countries currencies collapse and switch to bitcoin.

That is the dream scenario that Venezuela or Argentina dump their currency for bitcoin.

You don't understand how daytrading or how finance works in 2017. None of those rules effect anything I said.  All those rules say is they will find the best price at the time. 
No they don't match a order at once. They match the order one by one in time so small you could never tell it was shorter with the human eye. So when the book matches the price at the lowest possible, the bot immediately takes down the order. This happens again and again unless someone is dumb enough to buy at the higher price then the bot beats the buyer and scoops up the prices at the lower amount. 
It has been that way with every exchange in the world since the financial crash of 2008.

Transaction fee was probably not enough it will take a lot of time for it to get there. A tiny amount sent will require a bigger transaction fee.

There was a guy who had over 300,000 bitcoins. If he saved a third of it until 2013 (about 3 years later) when coins were worth $1000. He would have 100 million dollars. He made about 2 million and most of it he donated to Wikileaks. Knightmb
As far as people now retiring off of bitcoin it is possible if they got in at 1000 or below.  If they get in at 10k+ I don't see it unless they already have money.  If you need 50 bitcoins to retire that is already $500,000 you're investing which is quite a lot of money to invest in something that could go to $50. So if you have 500k most likely you already have enough to retire. I don't think it will but it isn't out of the realm of possibility it goes to $50.

Hype, speculation, and traders 
First two are self explanations. Traders create a massive buy cycle because  they buy to prevent prices for falling then sell when prices drop a lot.  It's the same reason oil was over $100 a barrel. Traders provide stability though since the massive price drops don't happen so often. By traders most of these are done by computers now through algorithms.

Sell before holding for one year is short term capital gaines tax. The  taxes are the same as ordinary income just ordinary income + bit coin profit.
Holding for a year plus is long term capital gains and taxed at 15% or your lower tax bracket if you earn very little. If you earn $418,000+ it is taxed at 20% which if you earn that much you should have an accountant. 
The current rules on taxes is once you sell or spend your bitcoins that is when taxes are due. "Spend" takes into account gambling which you would owe money on the bitcoin increased value from purchase and if you win on the amount won at their current value you owe income taxes on.  Online gambling doesn't report it so it is up to you to report it. The exchanges report you for amounts over $10,000 and I believe it is actually lower than $10,000 now, but you still only pay taxes when you spend or sell it.

You don't understand the market. Miners today are making $8000-$12000 in net profit off of 1 coin at today's pricing. Meaning if they mine 365  coins a year with $10,000 net profit that is $3,650,000 straight into the owners pocket. 
The way futures work they can buy a contract that says if bitcoin falls below 12,800 I pay you the difference but to get this contract you must pay me X amount per a bitcoin depending upon the amount you want and time table. It is just insurance that in case  bitcoin falls they still make a profit. Airlines did this with oil and I believe Southwest made a fortune off of it since when oil was $100+ a barrel they were paying maybe $50 since they got a futures contract when oil was under $40.
So if bitcoin drops to $700 like it was last year. Most likely mining companies who have futures contracts will just stop mining.

Daytrading was profitable in the 90s and early 2000s because there was nothing trading ups and downs of stocks besides humans which was necessary for financial markets including when people would want to sell a large amount of stock. Now the bots are too smart and are able to tell when a large sell or buy order happens. They also process news faster than any human is able to.

To be fair his point of selling 10k+ of coins would cause a dramatic fall in price if you sold 40k of coins it would severely hurt the price. Can the market stand 10k of coins being sold but if a person wanted to get rid of coins the fastest it would produce rapid selling from everyone at 40k  the number the price drops would be gigantic. Number of individuals who own 40k coins is incredibly small probably not even 10 though.

Kraken  always has the lowest buy prices.

-500 to 1000 (price triples) in a few months .

No that isn't how it works. A bot offers a 1000 BTC hoping some idiot will put in a buy at a higher price. The nanosecond  the lower amounts get sold it takes it off then reoffers it again at a higher than the previous price. Let's say you buy all 1000 it becomes a technology war on who can buy the lower priced btc which I'm guessing game the guy with 1000 BTC wins. On top of that they might have a cancel button and most "exchanges" have some sort of button for this which allowed the flash crash to happen on the stock market.
The bot is designed for day trading not just for having coins at a higher price than the current market price.

Same way any market crashes. Bear Sterns (Tether) is overleverage when the housing market crashes they cash out of X to make up for it, people find out abandon Bear Sterns, Bear Sterns has no money to cover anything so they are sold.  Which leads to Lehman Brothers (bitfinex traders in bitcoins) eventually failing and causing bankruptcy (bitcoin collapse). Causing a housing market/banking collapse in 2008. It takes one major domino to fall for a collapse.

Only company that sold  which allowed you to store them on their site in 2010 is MtGox and they got their coins stolen. They might be settling soon but you will only get back around $450 per a coin. Bit coin market existed, they just sent coins to your wallet if you bought I believe (peer to peer but not even sure). Other less known sites existed but they definitely were just site to wallet.
2009 new liberty standard exchange existed but I believe that was a address (wallet) to address (wallet)transaction site. Nobody was buying in 2009 though. If you mined yourself on one computer you were getting about a 1000 BTC a day in 2009.  If you bought $50 in 2009 you would have the first 50,000 BTC transaction which is not the case and doesn't exist.

Says the guy saying he has bitcoins worth well over 10 million dollars on a broken laptop asking reddit if he should take out the hard drive and recover over 10 million dollars.

Bitcoin is at 150 billion. Widely accepted the max bitcoin can get to is 80 trillion market cap ( 5 million per a bitcoin) or the global GDP.  Which would wipe out all forms of other currency and crypto to very small worth.  I believe it will get to 100k in two years and 500k in value in sometime, but as far bitcoin mining/faucets where it was easy to get whole bitcoins or if you bought bitcoin at $3 that  dream of taking no money and becoming rich is over. Bitcoin is a solid investment but the days of people turning nothing into millions is over.

At the very best case scenario for bitcoin, everything goes from dollars, euros, pounds to bitcoins. So the stock market shares stop being $100 to ________ bitcoin for a share. Bitcoin is a currency, you buy items and services for currency. Cash becomes almost worthless. So a famous painting gets sold for ______ bitcoins.
The rich still will have valuable property so no matter how high bitcoins go they will still be rich.

I think bit coin is a great investment but don't plan on being a millionaire from it now on a 300 GBP investment. Bitcoin market cap is about 145 billion. I think Bit coin will hit 100k in 2 years but it will have a market cap of 1.5 trillion. US GDP is 18.6 trillion,  total of all the world's equity markets is 62 trillion, and world's GDP 78 trillion. Only so high it can go in terms of currency and competitors.

Was about to type this. 5 million is the max for present day... Meaning all other crypto and currency is very low value.  It probably will never get there because there will be alternatives to bitcoin which will have value.

Who wants the million dollar+ cost of hiring a lobbying firm/firms? Answer is you will find no one to do it since most of the crypto inventors are libertarians. Libertarians economic principles align with Republicans but social issues most crypto investors are under 40 who believe in democratic when it comes to social issues. The biggest problem with libertarians they believe the market will always win. Ask online poker players and operators how that worked out? 
On top of all that no one wants to be the person footing the bill for over a million  dollars alone. Best bet is someone like Peter Thiel, but who knows how interested he is in protecting cryptos.
On top of all that coke is about a 200 billion Corp and spends about 8 million a year on lobbying while cryptos market cap is about 500 billion.

That plan won't work. The minute the IRS sees that you have millions in bitcoin an audit will happen. All this stealing is possible but once you leave the other country you're a resident of you will be arrested. When you don't have citizenship extradition becomes a lot easier for the US. Just look at the guy who ran btce.
On top of being stuck in a single country, your investments are stuck in that country or you have to money launder them. If you have ten million this plan is way easier but a billion dollars the 250 million in taxes is way easier to pay considering all the money you will lose in the future with investments.

THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT. Every course/major in every college there is a free alternative that can get you into a top level job. Programming, supply chain, finance, English... learning something faster, easier, and making it easier to get you the entry level job is what all colleges should do. 
All college/courses scams are really based on how well their students do outside of the college.
