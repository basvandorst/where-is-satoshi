Is that how price predictions are usually done?
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:51:57
Well, valid point!
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:41:03
Sounds purely logical, but economical laws and previous experience deny this, as corporations will easily earn more than "the state" in the majority of cases (depending on what he defines as "the state", of course)
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:27:38
These are "forks", Noah, people tend to use them differently...
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:42:42
The most hilarious fact is that people do it over and over and never learn. Any type of investment -- especially with such a high volatility -- is not for people who never learn.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:21:37
I keep it under my pillow.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:32:52
We have crypto and all thanks to Alan Turing, so it's not off-topic. And it's a shame what people have done to him. Finally we acknowledge all what he created for us in some way.
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:46:34
Can't judge as we all have "been there, done that"
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:30:46
As someone who supports cryptocurrency ideas, among which is privacy, you should've disguised driver's license plate number.

We'll buy a video review on our service there! Brucejuice98, send us your packages, please!

"Long term hodler" is a tautology. HODL = keep patience
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:17:03
I'm risky, not mad haha
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:50:17
Um... I guess we buying dips on these early black friday discounts
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:37:20
That's what I call buying the damn dip!
@_date: 2019-11-12 17:32:20
does it taste like gold?
@_date: 2019-11-15 15:51:55
bitcoin pizza day must be big there!
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:39:48
I'd say this friday is rather... RED
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:41:27
Dodging bullets better than Keanu did in the matrix
@_date: 2019-11-28 09:36:57
Buying dips is worth it... but idk tho
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:49:29
oh, you're a native? say something in internet
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:49:16
a real stripper would punch you for that
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:40:16
Just hodl on, we're gonna shop
@_date: 2019-11-27 10:35:41
He's saving for a tesla
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:38:16
Coz Reddit keeps telling us we're gonna be the richest generation because of it!
@_date: 2019-11-14 17:13:28
some real revolutionary thoughts these are.. priceless insights
@_date: 2019-11-29 15:09:16
On Wednesday it had the biggest one day rise in this month!
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:13:56
Another 6k down and I might afford one!
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:48:56
progress is moving in bigger and bigger stept! we love to see it
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:25:00
this will still probably work to impress those who don't know
@_date: 2019-11-21 09:49:16
This is fascinating to watch!
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:31:31
I mean he basically said that you CAN do it, just need a couple of states to throw together a couple of billions... I mean, I agree with him that it is unlikely to happen but like... if they wanted to they could :/
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:40:51
let's hope he uses hardware wallets
@_date: 2019-11-29 15:10:05
I was gonna say to the moon, but like.. bitcoin is there even when it falls... so, I guess.. TO MARS!
@_date: 2019-11-12 17:32:52
aren't they worried that filling in the wallet address will take longer than the performance?
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:23:34
I love the way this release matches with the Libra story.
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:25:24
It is not cool to steal someone else's pics, guys.
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:00:24
Really, really great news! I think crypto payments are the thing that will be popular in Portugal very soon.
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:20:04
It's a transaction-hash-cookie!
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:37:04
Lol me everyday.
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:27:55
It was there all along... crypto for the win! But also Monopoly, much like crypto investments, is all about the right cash at the right time
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:38:19
Banks are hot, no doubts!
@_date: 2019-10-25 14:42:21
Well, not everyone is hodling Bitcoin, what about other coins?
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:11:52
How many $BTC for this beauty?
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:19:37
Yes, you're right, that's the basics of economy. But why would people buy it now, when everyone knows that it can drop to 3k after 19k rise?
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:52:11
I think that banks are more likely to adopt crypto, than be defeated by it
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:31:21
Haha, hilarious!
@_date: 2019-06-05 11:55:04
Aren't people getting more and more freaked out with prices every time Apple release something?
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:24:25
Print more money, eat less food, -- this is how it works when inflation joins the game.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:36:47
If Bitcoin is your "little buddy", then who are you??
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:21:18
Isn't 15k too much for a market today? Something unusual must happen for BTC to rise so high.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:27:19
What's wrong with memes, aka entertainment in the scope of everyday hobby (or even a job, if you consider trading a job)? It's a very common phenomenon.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:47:42
4 years old.. that's what you call a Million Dollar Baby, the 2019 remake
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:22:13
The info in a headline is quite... obvious?
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:31:45
One day it's gonna be 5 BTC in a museum
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:20:49
Thanks for the nicest infographics, it helps!
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:13:36
But how are they going to actually control it? Id like to see them try
@_date: 2019-12-27 11:35:50
The hologram tho... mesmerising
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:11:59
Fair point!
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:22:09
The power that these majestic creatures have lol
@_date: 2019-12-20 09:23:48
Too risky at any given moment.. so we hodl on!
@_date: 2019-12-09 15:45:22
Crypto Christmas Day it is!
@_date: 2019-12-26 11:51:33
crypto can be quite like wine
@_date: 2019-12-06 16:01:01
But it will go over 20k tho... right? Please tell me it will
@_date: 2019-12-16 16:00:33
But the only wallet you should really have is not on a screen
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:37:44
Remember to hodl on on  a crazy ride like this not to fall out!
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:26:29
As many people as there are btc hodlers haha
@_date: 2019-12-30 15:19:53
"It's wIlD what's going on"
@_date: 2019-12-23 14:51:50
The only way millenials and further generations do garage sales ��
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:33:40
Looks kinda like the new tesla truck... can imagine the bills from this thing!
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:51:46
I guess, redditors who wanna massive upvotes have already prepared their 20k-memes (me too, me too)
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:53:51
But is he gonna drop a milli on us like he did on TeamTrees?
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:22:33
aNy dAy NoW!
@_date: 2019-12-16 16:04:54
That not only BTC&lt; but crypto, in general, has been proving itself the best performing asset type over all the traditional ones for the past couple of years.
@_date: 2019-12-16 15:58:47
LMAO crypto folk would like to see his body too, preferably alive!
@_date: 2019-12-05 12:12:04
As always - just hodl on, he'll sober up eventually... its been a stressful month
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:35:35
Adoption bringing us new ways to earn on bitcoin haha.. we selling rings now!
@_date: 2019-12-26 17:02:21
There is always a way! Our community can build its own platforms, there already are some!
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:05:35
Amazing for you! Just be careful with what you got now!
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:12:29
This will be the official recognition we deserve haha
@_date: 2019-12-27 15:16:52
Great footage of crypto taking over the world!
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:38:41
Well the discounts have been crazy!
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:58:59
Is it what mass adoption looks like?
@_date: 2019-09-18 16:26:55
I wonder if it's a promo again or a real payment possibility that is here to stay!
@_date: 2019-09-06 12:31:10
It seems to be rather exotic!
@_date: 2019-09-13 19:28:23
This is what people mean by "Time is money”!
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:58:50
Oops, I did it again...
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:03:17
Isn't dying for Craig Wright a bit too much?
@_date: 2019-05-16 08:58:37
I'm scared to compare BTC and Gregor Clegane, cause Gregor was actually A THING no one knew how to defeat, and its creator never revealed a secret . Oh, wait...
@_date: 2019-05-24 11:12:00
Looks very cute, but does it really make sense to  pay for such stuff in BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:59:01
Maybe they are busy deleting their tweets and comments about BTC, lol
