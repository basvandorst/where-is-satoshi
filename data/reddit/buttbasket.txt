listen mate, I don't know what you're up to but I will assume that your intentions are good. Bottom line is, don't try to outsmart the law. The fact that you are in this situation indicates that you have no idea what you're doing. 
Just go through the legit channels like an exchange or LocalBitcoins and you will be fine.

Excuse my ignorance but what do you mean by "inputs are more expensive than outputs"?

Paypal will just freeze your account if they sense a suspiciously large amount of funds added to your account lol

1) What are the drivers for the price of Bitcoin? 
Is it purely based on the volume of trades or are there other underlying factors that could effect the price up/down? 
2) What are forks and could I potentially "double" my money when a fork happens or do I need to decide which fork I want my coins to transfer to? Can I take advantage of forks to make more money? 
3) can I import my private keys in more than one digital wallet? For example having my wallet on both Exodus and Electrum. Exodus is east and has a nice UI but Electrum allows me to set my own fees 
Cheers everyone!!!

Hi there, 
Thanks for the explanation!
From my understanding, the more channels you open the more fees you will need to pay, correct? for example, you will need to pay a fee to miners on the main blockchain if you want to open a channel with Starbucks, A supermarket, your friends, your work and any other place you plan to make/or receive regular payments to (by fees to miners I mean the fees required to transfer your BTC balance to an LN wallet and create a smart contract with a party on the LN network). The other option would be to at least have 1 channel open with a person and hope that this one person has connections to all of the parties you expect to make/receive payments from/to. Am I understanding this correctly?
If yes, then, my question now is: What's stopping a service, say Paypal (or company x) from opening channels with all of these businesses and having you open only 1 channel with them, making transactions hop less and also reducing/eliminating the fees of opening multiple channels on the LN? Wouldnt that make more sense? What about a Bitcoin IOU? Wouldn't that be more scalable and less headache-y to everyone? 
Please forgive my English, it is not my first language. I hope that you were able to understand my post :)
