Not 6 months, but on highly contested launch dates, people purchased iPhones to immediately sell them at 2x the price on ebay.

Not the dude you're responding to, but I'm pretty sure that'd be the 4% fee for buying with a card instead of a bank account.

Why would this affect human nature in that way?

After careful consideration, I've decided this is a Ponzi scheme devised to impoverish the gays.

I can't decipher the code. Is this crypto?

Hey, it seems like a demanding job, but I'd be willing to make the sacrifice and step up to the plate. I've got about $100 in bitcoin. Is that enough skin in the game to become a "Bitcoin CEO"?

Hmmm I would have livestreamed it, but 
A) I think that violates twitch.tv terms and
B) Like hell I'm livestreaming my private key!
Such a nice secure feeling knowing that my private key is safe between my cheeks.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:51:24
Would that give me the ability to separate the coins? Or will I only have access to whichever blockchain has more proof of work?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:22:54
So I need to move my bitcoin to another platform? Which secure platform makes splitting the coins easiest and safest?

As soon as you really need the value in fiat currency. One approach is to hold until you can deal entirely in crypto and bypass fiat entirely, but that's not necessarily feasible if you need to cash out in the short term. A good approach is to purchase things with bitcoin that you would spend fiat on anyway, and then replace that bitcoin with the fiat you would have spent, so you are maintaining your crypto holdings, getting what you need, and increasing the cryptocurrency's transaction volume.

He's not saying it would necessarily be a good thing that they get involved. It would let Bitcoin legitimacy, but as you say, it would incentivize price manipulation.

Perhaps we believe that because that's the way the current systems have been designed to operate. It could be that bitcoin is just a very good thing for a very large number of people. What you said is of course possible, but I'll reserve my judgment; in the case of such a burgeoning technology, only time will tell.

I think BTC will be used much more in corporate dealings than gold has been. It is a store of value for the common man, but also a powerful tool for business.
