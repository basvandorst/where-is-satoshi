Trump was the best thing that ever happened to crypto currency.
Markets thrive when things are predictable and consumers have confidence.  Nukes, WW3, trickle down economics don’t really give people the warm and fuzzy.  I’m still convinced nothing has changed since the ‘08 retraction, so I’m expecting a repeat, just worse.  
Bitcoin is my lifeline out of the next disaster, and I’d like to thank Trump for speeding along the process.

Technically you can’t “mine” Bitcoin with a 1070, but before the Nicehash theft, you could’ve used your 1070 for mining, and get compensated in bitcoins, which is basically the same thing.

No one is probably willing to admit it, but Trump's presidency is a major factor in the transfer of wealth into digital currency.  Markets like predictability, and he makes Gold look about as safe as a pink sheet.
Edit:  pink sheet reference is a fucking exaggeration

Hah!  Wait until the next '08.  Nothing has changed fundamentally yet the stock market keeps on bubbling.  Ain't no interest rates and bailout packages that can stop the dominoes when the next Lehman bros fails. My point was that if the pres was the typical pres, btc would still be far below what it's worth today.

I haven't been around since then, but I wish I kept mining when I started a few years ago (pre silkroad debacle.) I'm back for keeps now.  Good luck my friends.
