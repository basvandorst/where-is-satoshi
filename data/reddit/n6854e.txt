Did you read the website?
Download it and run it for yourself.

Seems okay for sending a few bucks and then withdrawing it to PayPal, or using their Shift card. Sure as hell wouldn't leave anything more than necessary with them, but it's easy enough to send what you want to spend and then spend it. If you use the shift card I'm pretty sure there's no fee aside from the transaction.
But yeah overall Coinbase fucking sucks.
