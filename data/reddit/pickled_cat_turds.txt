Some loser who thinks he's a genius now posted a video...
He has a puchable face.  Where was he 4+ years ago?
Fuck him.

He's a disgusting piece of shit.

Bithumb is quite possibly one of the stupidest possible names for a BTC business next to now defunct Google backed "Buttercoin."
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:45:17
LMAO.  If this is true, they have completely missed the point of the Bitcoin Blockchain.
This is hilarious to me.
Edit: Whomever came up with this idea and those who agreed should all be fired for their lack of technical knowledge.  This is pretty much identical to the early internet days when corporations wanted to build their own because their in-house "experts" told them that was the best idea.
Some of the most brilliant minds on the planet are developing Bitcoin...  It's backed by the most powerful computer network on the planet.  But, sure, go ahead and listen to your internal IT guys and shareholders.  That will end well.
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:43:49
Yes.  It will drop to at least $200 USD.  It will remain there until Davos decides what they will do to deal with it.  At that point, they will be 3-4 years behind the tech and will have another conference.
Fuck them all.  They are ruining the planet.  All of these ignorant fucks need to die so we can fix things.

I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico.
You pulled out your .2 or less BTC?  Please tell me more.  /s
I hang on your every word going forward all-knowing Oracle.
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:30:31
You, rwill NEVER be wealthy as a result of bitcoin.
Your newly registered site also will not help you.
You either laughed at all the smart people years ago or think you are going to be wealthy by making a shitty website and jumping onboard.  You are not going to be a gazzilionaire thanks to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:01:17
I got the exact same email last night.
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:27:35
You all do realize that the people manipulating things read these posts, right?
Some of them are in this thread.
They are going to crash it several thousand more.
So, you better have your big boy pants on.
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:08:46
Are they using the most powerful computer network and decentralized network on the planet or are they using a database?
How much longer is this we love Blockchain shit going to continue?

How much longer until Asia is completely banned at the protocol level? (China/India)  This shit is seriously getting old.

Sell your .2 BTC and go away.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:08:53
Well, you're not going to get that either.
It's funny how all of the people who have flocked here over the last 4-5 months think they're geniuses.
They aren't.  You lose. bye-bye.

The article was written by a "contributor" not Forbes.

"This sounded very russian."
Hold up everyone we've got a motherfucking genius here. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:27:15
He's a "contributor."  Some random asshat who was allowed to publish a piece on their site.
Pay attention.

Can we just ban Asia, please?  The government manipulation has been going on for years now.

This guy knows what he's talking about.  He clearly knows paragraphs.
I don't read shit like this.

It's back to where it was 14 days ago.  Are you kidding me?
Sensationalist article.

Hi new guy who has .2 BTC or less.  You have no idea what you are talking about.

Thanks for your opinion.

I've only seen your posts over the past few days and I can already tell you have no fucking idea what you are talking about or doing.

This article and others like it are crap.  The DOW is where it was 14 days ago.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:41:14
If you are serious, why are you asking for the opinion(s) of random people on the Internet?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:57:30
LOL.  You are a fool.

You are a fool.

He's an idiot.  Even people who work with him in the White House say he's a dumb motherfucker.
I work with people like you who would defend Charles Manson if he was the Republican ticket (he's dead now, I know).  It doesn't matter anymore.  Nothing matters.  Stupidity is in control of this country.

How is my post jerking anyone off?  I never said hodl.  I never said anything you suggested.
I think it's all hilarious.
You are not a bright person.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:51:03
Over the 5 years I've posted here, I've been laughed at, downvoted to oblivion, etc.  Ultimately, I have been proven correct about almost everything I have suggested every. single. fucking. time.
So, fucking blow me.

All of Asia should be banned.  Every ~6 months China bans bitcoin.  I'm tired of this shit.
I know a ban will never happen in the protocol.  
I can dream.
