Something strange is happening, before every drop dumped alts harder, now alts seem somehow increase their ratio against btc and only btc loose more value. Is the dominance shaking?!

Another day, bitcoin still alive. Cheers every one.

Congrats to the moderators of this thread. You manage to drag it to 50 comments on average per day with your useless bans. This used to be a great community, you ruined it.
@_date: 2019-11-25 14:24:19
That's a lie, in 2015 it made a lower low.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:04:08
Didn't know what to buy for my birthday, so I got more btc.

If from 14k to 7k, there was 7k $ wiped out, it can be possible for another 7k to be wiped out and value to be 0?!

Stop thinking that bitcoin will be the currency some day because it won't, is mathematically provable that all coins will be lost, we already lost lots of them. Indeed, there will be blockchain and will be used worldwide and BTC will be just the way to invest in the technology , a store of value. So yes, definitely good news for BTC price today.

There are rumors that there is a big pump coming today, anyone to confirm that?
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:57:15
there are 3 days left bro, don't bet against the prophecy
@_date: 2019-10-20 14:43:59
Not sure a out 6k but I am expecting a drop below 7500 tonight.
@_date: 2019-10-10 07:19:27
ETF rejected, expect a crash soon?
@_date: 2019-10-14 07:29:16
good morning, any forecast for this week?
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:18:48
Brexit deal, gold falling sharply, crypto follow the same patern?
@_date: 2019-10-27 08:34:54
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:36:21
Bull trap?
@_date: 2019-10-25 07:32:17
It's been so long since bears are making money in the market, don't you think should be time for a reverse soon?
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:40:48
Bitcoin just finished a full rotation around the sun, moon next?
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:22:01
BTC started to get media attention, long term support 6.5k promoted as the lower part of the rising channel from 2013, we are going for a huge run up now, get ready.

If quantum computers are for real, bitcoin will be the last thing you should be afraid.
@_date: 2019-09-18 07:18:58
Shall I trade my btc for alts? This looks really irresistible.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:21:53
I was reffering to the technology, is always evolving so that is why I am wondering why should be only bitcoin and no other better technology can replace it? That's why I made the comparison with mobile phones, they evolved, something better appeared. So why should we keep beeing bitcoin maximalists? What is the reason behind it?
@_date: 2019-09-18 07:24:59
so btc will start to rally soon?
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:38:15
looks like officially is bearmarket now
@_date: 2019-09-27 10:36:48
Maybe a silly question, but how will bitcoin survive overtime? I mean people will eventually die and I don't think that everyone will transfer their private keys, so in time will end up with a lot of btc blocked / lost in network, right?
@_date: 2019-09-30 14:59:13
Good morning America, thank you for pumping!
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:10:42
BCH is pumping, will btc follow soon?
@_date: 2019-09-23 16:23:42
Why it should be only bitcoin and no alt coins? What is the reason behind it? And please don't tell that bitcoin was first, Motorola was also first doing mobile phones.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:27:47
This is unbelievable, waiting for Bakkt for over a year and now when is finally up and running, btc is dumped. Lesson learned, when others are greedy, should be a bear.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:16:26
Why did I get so many downvotes when I just tried to help everyone here to avoid loosing money? This was kind of obvious, da fuck? People here only know to type moon and lambo? This is so toxic environment.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:49:36
and boom, we are shooting up
@_date: 2019-09-24 09:44:11
still waiting for the breakout to see which direction is bouncing
@_date: 2019-09-18 06:48:34
Shall I change my btc for alts? This is starting to look irresistible.
