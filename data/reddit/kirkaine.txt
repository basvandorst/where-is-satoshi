A 20% difference in a 0.628% factor is small.  If we want to be technical, it becomes a 0.13% difference.
I don't work for the government, but I do work with economic data, which is why I actually understand it.  What industry are you in, I wonder?
Also, do I really need to add that 'the government are lying idiots because I day so' is not evidence?  Please show some actual evidence for your claims next time.

Like I said, it tracks prices.  In order to determine how much we should care about the price of beef vs the price of gasoline, it's weighted by a snapshot of consumer behaviour.  However, because comparison requires consistency, this snapshot is only updated once every 20 years or so, it's not continuously tracked.

So, bitcoin solves nothing.

I never said it didn't look at spending patterns.  It's a measure of how prices affect people, of course you need to know where people spend their money in order to do that.  What I've been saying is that it does not *track* (i.e. continuously monitor) spending patterns.  If you want the quote for that:

And if you think that 5% is hyperinflation (nevermind how you magically got the that figure, true inflation is actually lower because of things like falling tech prices) you need to find a dictionary.  USD has never had hyperinflation, and never will, unless the entire FOMC get lobotomies.
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:00:52
Minor adjustments (like the number of eggs in a carton) are unavoidable, and do not significantly compromise consistency.  Nevertheless, that doesn't change the fact that CPI tracks prices, not habits.
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:15:51
The FOMC could have solved inflation too.  The USD has never been inflated, nor can it be.  
I know exactly how the CPI is calculated (and I should lose my job if I didn't).  It tracks the change in prices of a number of goods, weighted by average purchasing habits in 2009-2010.  It does *not* track changes in those purchasing habits, as you seem to think.
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:36:36
Yes, the CPI considers the typical person.  Is that supposed to be a problem?

You can't honestly believe that, can you?  What about the millions dead in famines in Bengal, Bangladesh, Ireland, and Wollo (to name but a few) who starved to death because they couldn't afford food and they didn't have an effective government to provide aid?
@_date: 2014-12-22 23:59:37
The corn laws were axed shortly after the Irish famine began, and other tariffs were relaxed with them.  The potato blight was obviously the initial cause of the famine, but if the best argument you can give for libertarianism is that it can let millions of people die from a single crop disease that's not really a point in its favour.
Food was being exported out of Ireland during the famine (as it was in Wollo, Bangladesh, and Bengal), as farmers sold their food on the free market for export because Irish potato farmers were too poor to afford to buy it.  A responsible government can step in here and prevent this by providing short term aid to the people affected (just look at India or Botswana for examples of this).  Libertarianism can't, and simply allows the poor to starve.

And the USD can not be hyperinflated because the sanity of the FOMC is, for all intents and purposes, just as reliable as the source code of bitcoin.
All you've shown there is a quote saying that the Fed use CPI (alongside other indicators), not a definition of how it's calculated.  Make no mistake, CPI is calculated from the prices of a fixed basket of goods.  This is the kind of shit you learn in the first lecture of university macro.
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:58:01
I don't know how you missed it, but here:
That document gives all the data collection and processing procedures for the CPI, and tell you *exactly* how it's calculated.  I recommend you read it if you still want to argue that the CPI is being manipulated.
(On the topic of seasonal adjustment, it's so that it better reflects inflation.  Apples becoming more expensive when they're out of season is biology, not economics, so we want a measure that accounts for that in order to get the economic effect.  Nevertheless, the BLS do provide the unadjusted numbers.)
And as for the M2 numbers, inflation is defined as an increase in prices, not an increase in M2 (and the relationship is far, *far* more complicated than you might think if you learned macroeconomics on libertarian youtube channels).  They data is perfectly consistent.
Now, back to those three questions.  Do you want to at least give me an honest answer as to why you're avoiding them?
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:25:09
Beef and veal accounts for 0.628% of the weighting in the CPI-U^1 (a fact we know thanks to the transparency with which the BLS publish their specification) so yes, a 6 percentage point difference in that 0.6% is a small effect.
Stop dodging the question.  Without starting from the point that 'the government are lying idiots because they just are', give me some actual evidence to show that the CPI is being deliberately manipulated, or that it is not transparent.  While you're at it, tell me what standard of evidence you require to deem a measure transparent.
1.  And 0.808% in the less common CPI-W.

You're missing the difference between real and nominal data.  Honestly, you should really go and take a first year college macroeconomics course to clear some of this stuff up.
Nominal inflation refers to the amount of money there is.  The US has a nominal inflation rate of 4.9%.  Real inflation is the change in the amount of stuff you can buy with the same amount of money (i.e. purchasing power).  It's different for a number of reasons, such as the fact that the population is increasing, and that manufacturing technology is making things cheaper.  If we want to measure purchasing power we should look at purchasing, and that's exactly what the CPI does.
Seriously, go learn some actual economics, it'll do you a world of good.  Now, back to those three questions.

The US dollar can not be hyperinflated, but paper money can.
Bitcoin can't be hyperinflated, but cryptocurrencies can.
What's the advantage to Bitcoin here?
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:25:57
Inflation is good, because of babies.  If the population is growing, the money supply should grow with it.
It *is* a fixed basket, or at least as close as it's possible to make it.  As your quote shows, the basket is updated when it becomes incalculable, not when consumption habits change.

I suppose you can follow that claim up with plenty of examples of efficient and fully functioning completely private roads, hospitals, public safety, fire prevention, and education?
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:18:38
Right now.  Just go here 
and click 'detailed report tables'.
That Forbes account is targeted at the media, not the government.  The government put all the data out there, it's just that newspapers tend to only pick up on one measure without actually investigating it properly.
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:06:47
You can not inflate the US dollar using the current Fed policies, what's the difference?
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:43:46
So we're agreed that hyperinflation is a non-problem that bitcoin doesn't really solve.
You also might want to go look up the definition of CPI in order to avoid future embarrassment.
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:46:36
I already showed you the document, as well as explained the discrepancy.  BLS seasonally adjust (in order to get broad macroeconomic trends), while USDA care about the direct payments to suppliers, so they don't.  Something like agriculture is pretty dependent on weather, so it's unsurprising that this has an effect.  Everybody knows what's going on, because they put the entire procedure up on the web for everyone to read (as I suggest you do, because you still have a number of misconceptions about the data).
Show me these other discrepancies.  Every step of the way I've defended my claims with actual data and evidence, while you've responded with 'but it must be lies, because it's the government'.  So. to recap:
1.  What evidence is there to show that the BLS manual I linked you is not how CPI is actually calculated, or what scope for abuse is there within that specification?
2.  What hypothetical evidence could I produce to show that the CPI wasn't being manipulated?
3.  What exactly do you do for a living, because I'm kind of curious.
@_date: 2014-05-12 08:04:03
I guess I should have used clearer terms.
Cryptocurrencies solve nothing.
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:04:55
Alright.  I've given you the actual formula for how CPI is calculated, I'm not sure what could be more transparent.  Perhaps you should make your position more clear.  So, tell me then
1.  Why do you not believe it is transparent, and what evidence do you have for this?
2.  What standard of evidence would you require from a transparent  (by your definition) economic measure?
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:14:53
The USDA don't seasonally adjust their figures, the BLS do.  That's a small methodological difference, not a conspiracy.
You still haven't answered my questions.  What standard of transparency do you want that isn't satisfied by the 108 page specification of the formula?
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:30:05
Reflects spending patterns in the 2009-2010 Consumer Expenditure Survey, and uses them to track prices.  There's a (big) difference between using spending patterns in building an index, and tracking them.  Directly from the BLS

Higher courts don't use juries, only judges.  Most of the trials are people being quizzed by judges, and third parties far and wide can write their opinions and send them to the court.  Higher courts most certainly get all the information, they just get it from a wider range than expert witnesses who are paid to push one side.
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:54:52
Barely any transparency?  I really don't know where you're getting this.  [Here's the 108 page manual for how the CPI is caluclated]( published on the BLS's website.  They're completely open about their formula.
