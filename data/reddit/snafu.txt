Honestly I would invest everything I have. But instead I'm a broke ass student with rent and now I have 6 dollars to my name. But I have .003 Bitcoin! So looking to the future and the moon.

Absolutely, but really wanted me some Bitcoin. Bought some around 4500 and had to sell at 9000. All and all didn’t lose any money but I was super upset I had to sell.

Can't remember the name but it's the Bitcoin episode on Inside Man that CNN series with Morgan Spurlock. The guy who did the Super Size Me documentary. He tries to live on only Bitcoin for a week.

What should I use. I recently purchased bitcoin through Coinbase. But I've read some negative things about it.
