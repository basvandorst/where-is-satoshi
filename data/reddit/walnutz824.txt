Same way ur mom gets great tips while working at hooters. She's ugly as a horse. But she knows the owner. Get me bra? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:55:28
Wonder how many he owns? and at what price he bought in? just curious? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:52:56
I can't see it?
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:42:19
So a coinbase vault is no good?
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:42:53
I notified support again.. they are looking into the issue. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-12-06 16:06:15
It can also be downloaded for apple? according to the site. And yeah im down to do this. I just dont understand why its not a good idea to keep in a vault on coinbase? it has like 4 factors of identity... I will def look into this tho
@_date: 2016-12-06 16:03:15
LMFAO! This guy can party!

@_date: 2016-12-02 13:39:52

@_date: 2016-12-07 02:35:02
Thank you so much. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:32:24
I also agree. I honestly think it is going to surge....very soon. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:33:35
Coinbase is easy , which is what I use. Then I do a transfer to my offline vault. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:09:31
Lets give it sometime buy buy buy! 2017 is going to be a milestone and personally i think it will increase at least 400%
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:18:44
I have them in a online vault...now we wait and see. thanks for the support friend.
@_date: 2016-12-06 16:13:10
I agree. Thanks so much.
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:24:18

@_date: 2016-12-07 02:34:04
I agree did my research and I'm taking them all out of the vault waiting the 2 days and I'm done. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:31:02

The end of paypal is near. Me and my friends all had to collect money to pay for bachelor party. One person says Venmo,Paypal..etc..  Long story short all 14 people paid via Bitcoin and it was awesome. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:53:04
Makes me feel good dumping my life savings in this at 620
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:24:18
I feel like it could be a inside job. You need to think long and hard of everyone who has access to the wallet(s).
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:18:40
This is probably the most interesting thing i have seen in a while on here.  good luck. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:58:39
Freezing accounts. Can't pull out issues. Id verify issues. Weeks to get bank transfer. Just so many issues. I'm over it 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:59:45
coinbase alternatives? bank wire buy? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:49:01
Coinbase gav me a bad taste in my mouth. Sold most of my coins weeks ago oh well my loss
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:03:38
