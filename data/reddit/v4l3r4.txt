Referring to brainwashed North Koreans. They call this sub North Corea. It's not racist unless you're the special kind of stupid.
They do somewhat have a point since some members here are far from objective and are very committed to the idea of Bitcoin only being something they can sell to others for profit instead of the whole global digital currency thing.
Both of these subs are truly toxic, half of the discussion is shitting on the other sub and the rest is crypto news affiliate link filled website spam and really poor memes with maybe one interesting discussion a week about the technology.

No, capacity is a silly feel-good measure of usability. Last I saw you still can't reliably send more than $30 worth of btc on LN. Once the average node can reliably route a few hundred dollars worth then it'll be all good.

This is a completely asinine correlation. You don't mine bitcoin with that 1080Ti, you mine altcoins in exchange for bitcoin - altcoins which have fallen in price more than bitcoin itself has, thus driving rewards for GPU mining lower. You need actual ASICs mining actual BTC and maybe then you can try to correlate bitcoin price to mining rewards.
