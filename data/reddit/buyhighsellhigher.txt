doesn't look like they are in the US. LibertyX (libertyx.com) has been doing this for over a year now. Bitquick (bitquick.co) also before they went under.

Why do you want to have a leader for bitcoin? You're missing the point. Maybe that's why you sold all your coin.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:35:34
Awesome. Thank you!

A bunch of those companies probably no longer support 2x. They just haven't updated their position. They are waiting for others to do so first and then it is easier for them to say they want to avoid a damaging split.

What does that mean for Tether? Wasn't Kraken the only place you could trade USD for USDT?
Feels like more of an issue for Tether than Kraken, which has other fiat onramps

Good point. Should be more decentralized than solar then.

Sounds like we need to dump bizcoin if/when they waste resources supporting it

funny how when a bank copies innovators they are pioneers, but when innovators did it they were suspicious and dangerous
banks were able to copy innovators by using the BSA / terror as an excuse. shameful and unamerican, but what do you expect.
cool thing ab hodling is that even this behavior accrues to hodlers.

Isn't 2x working on a loophole to get around 0.15.0.1's protections?

A lot of support lists are opt-out.
Most don't care to waste time getting themselves removed from various fake lists.

You don't need to fire your bitcoin traders either because they just retired

Please stop the contentious hard forks

Dude it's still early
I know it may feel like everyone owns bitcoin, but they don't
Very few people understand it; far fewer actually own it
