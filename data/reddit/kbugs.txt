Thats got nothing to do with how much money artists make from spotify. If record companies get better royaties from spotify then they have more money to either keep or pay their artists.  The point I am making is that spotify doesn't pay artists they pay labels. If artists are getting a shitty deal then they need to speak to their label and stop having a go at spotify. No one ever seems to take issue with youtube, the biggest music streaming service in the world, who make shit loads off advertising and don't pay musicians anything.  People that rip on spotify always have massive flaws in their argument.

Spotify doesn't pay artists they pay record labels who own distribution rights. If artists aren't getting enough money from digital sales then thats their fault for not having better deals with their label. Spotify pay 70c in the dollar they make. I challenge you to find any business that pays this much out of their profit in royalties. Get your facts straight before ripping on a company thats revolutionising the music industry.

I was thinking exactly that. There's so many people throwing their toy out of the pram. If you want decentralised this is what can happen.  So suck it up. Warning signs were there. There is no excuse for lazy

So...this ones always bugged me. Most legit currencies have a value that is back up by something tangible like gold. Bitcoin is not backed up by anything other than a collective belief that it does hold value. Is this an issue? Discuss...

Oh man!  I've been involved with BTC for ages and the amount of snobbery is mind boggling.  The stupid thing about it is that the people with the attitude almost always have no real understanding of how to maintain BTCs longterm success and value.  Until these idiots start to realise that BTC is a currency not a stock, and use it accordingly,  BTC is aways going to be an unstable entity.  IT IS NOT REAL GUYS.  GOLD IS REAL.
