Add on to that with all the press and normals buying it just to see what it's about just got a wake up call. Unlike the last spike in 2014, this time there is a lot more attention on it, and it's all turning negative and the prospective buyer pool has taken a really massive hit.

Let the community know if you go through with this and I'll be the first in line to get one! Also, are your shirts the really soft kind?

You should do a special run of Bitcoin shirts as a promotion for accepting it! Been looking for a good bitcoin shirt for a while and there aren't many around you can actually buy with bitcoin. I see you have 'I accept Bitcoin' but I'm looking for just a bitcoin logo or something, would rather not advertise like some kind of gigilo out on the street :)

I think another part of it is that people got home from work after all the Bitcoin press, their eyes bugged out, and many are participating in a large selloff right now. The seller volume is nuts.

As someone who just started working at Bloomberg, I also didn't expect as much charm from Bloomberg, but they are really changing into a pretty cool news source.

If Deeze is English, he would refer to this as boxing day (they have Black Friday the day after Xmas with the crazy sales)
