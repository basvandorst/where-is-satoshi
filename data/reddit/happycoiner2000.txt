Shorts are already gone dude...
@_date: 2018-09-01 23:48:39
Oh yes. And I'll be shorting my way down to 5k baby.
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:23:04
Yeah that's how you know we're getting close to a reversal of trend haha
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:08:38
Not really a surprise tho
@_date: 2018-08-28 10:48:10
Try selling at 20k next time

Truth is we lost money cause we didn't know what we were doing and just jumped on a hype train. Obviously things don't just go up and have to come down and it's our own fault and mistake. If you had sold near the top and waited to buy back in at these ridiculous prices, you would've trippled your amount of btc. This is a hard lesson for everyone and personally I've been learning a lot since then. I can now say that I make consistant gains in this market even in bear mode. The past months have been thw best opportunity to learn.

I bought last summer. I keep thinking if I sold in December/January, I could've bought so much more at this current price. This has been a good learning opportunity. I won't be making the same mistake again.

Nothing tells me it will hit $1M so no thanks I'll make money with what I have, doesn't really matter to me where btc goes. I guess I'd like the technology to be successfull tho.

I know what MC, circulating supply and price is. You can put it however you want but coins with low volume/low MC = higher volatility/bigger price spikes and vice versa.
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:10:28
Really? That's because of the low volume. If btc was to replace fiat currencies, the volume would be incredibly higher and there would be no more of those hige spikes in price. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:26:30
Coins with lower MC have lower volume by the way, which means more volatility. Why the hell is MC a lie and an illusion that makes no sense...
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:01:54
Ok I'll take a look at that!
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:06:09
Why would you want to buy a lambo with BTC at it's current price?
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:26:51
What? Your comment is unrelated to mine and doesn't disprove it. Traders set the prices, yeah and so what? Doesn't change that low volume = low liquidity = high price spikes (up or down). It's a fairly basic concept. Someone buying $100 million worth of btc will have a much bigger impact on the price if the market cap is worth $1B as opposed to $1T.

Just wait for it
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:05:16
That's a pretty sweet fire hydrant
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:10:20
Bitcoin hodlers weren't like that when price was at 3k. r/quityourbullshit
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:54:59
Wait that's poutine?? :o
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:22:30
Not sure what I'd do with that!
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:07:14
I really don't think we need another subgenre, except for this one.

Meanwhile, Julian Assange still isn't verified.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:56:42
If people didn't care the price wouldn't dip every time there's one of those FUD news.
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:31:23
I WONDER WHY
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:46:45
You got that right!
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:20:25
It'd make sense if he appeared as a big fat red candlestick.
