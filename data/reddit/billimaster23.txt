Will bitcoin ever be useable in day to day life. Like buying coffee or beers or going to the restaurants. Is there any plan what so ever to be able to buy McDonald using bitcoin? In 2020?

If I used 5k in bitcoins to buy a car. Wont that count as a gain in capital and counts towards my taxes
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:58:41
From what I understand you cant use bitcoin in day to day life. Fees will continue to grow making sub 300$ transactions not that worth it. 
People say that you could use it to send 20 000$ across the globe with minimal fee. But the beneficiary would still need to switch it to regular currency to be able to spend it for everyday needs which cost fees and time. 
Can someone clear this up for me?

It's not that much for me. 
I had a few hundreds over the last years and it made me a few thousand, Its just a shame I didn't invest 20k before
