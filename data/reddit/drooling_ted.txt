And by the way there is no means to buy BTC with USD here in India and the prices here are about 3000 dollars higher than the prices on most of the exchanges!!
Was wondering if someone played like by buying with USD and sending it to a Indian exchange and encash it, he/she could easily gobble up 3000 dollars of super easy cash!!
Any thoughts on that??

How do you sell??
You gota be having an Indian bank account to sell!!

Ain’t sure if non Indians can trade there or not.
Funds are withdrawn directly to the bank account that has been linked!!

Worst exchange to buy BTC
But the only one available in India!!
Nor do they lower the prices when the BTC prices fall but they make sure to increase it exponentially whenever there is a price increase!!

Dead cat bounce??

What if all the people who bought BTC higher than the range of USD 9000 start to sell it off and take their profits, I bet the prices would start to fall and they could rebuy when the prices crash!!
I see the daily volume being 10 Billion, cant they just wait for the prices to fall before investing??
Like a coordinated dump??

And now m wondering how to make up for the losses!!
It’s the whales who determine the market flows and the small time peeps like me are the ones who get hit the hardest!!
