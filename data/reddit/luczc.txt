Seriously, the weekly volume on Bitstamp is around 100kbtc. If you want avoid being more than 10% of the volume, you can still buy 10k per week. Just buy randomly 140btc 10 times per day, and in three weeks, you will have 30kbtc. So, buy at market or slightly above, no need to burn cash when the market can provide the same volume.

Leaking the MtGox business plan was a stupid move and propulsed MtGox from a state where fiat withdrawals were slow but still possible to a state where everything is locked up. 
My understanding is that you created the damage, and Mark Karpeles is moving as fast as possible, while probably under a gag order and with a lot of funds seized, to limit the damage and protect MtGox customers assets.
TL;DR You are the bad guy, not Mark.

Some small holders are selling. A big guy is buying. The buyer is bigger than all the sellers combined. 
The buyer is big because he has been mostly right in the past. The small sellers are small because they were mostly wrong in the past. Morality: follow the big guy.

Why should we trust you? You are asking us to help you to access the old keys and broken code that may allow access to MtGox cold storage private keys. It looks to me at a heist attempt. 
Even if you are honest, the mafia is reading us and may pay you a visit, on the possibility that you may have the info leading to the MtGox cold storage private keys. Do you really want to live with this on your back?
I think that you may inadvertantly create some risks for you, just because you consider the probability of MK being completely stupid greater that the probability of the US gov. issuing a "don't touch cold storage, we will see it" and gag order.

You have some security questions here: 
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:36:16
Here is a possible scenario:
- Hi Mark, I am a big investor, I want to buy 2.5M$ of BTC, but I don't trust you, so I will not put a cent in MtGox. Would you please setup a bot to buy for me 2.5M$ of BTC, in small amounts, in order not to push the market upward?
- Sure, let me set up a bot to buy 2.5M$ of BTC with my own money
- (later) I have a wallet ready with the requested amount, and a log proving that I did buy in small amounts. Can we meet to exchange the private key against a big check?
- Sure. You can start another bot on another account for the next trade. What are the fees?
- Free for you. Your buying activity create a higher price on MtGox than on other exchanges, and it is good for my business. Please feel free to make as many 2.5M$ purchase as you want, I will open a separate account for each of them.

I think a proof of solvency is useless. Mt Gox did a proof of solvency some years ago, by moving all the coins they have. And? See where we are now.
Kraken has proven that all the coins are here. But they can be hacked, and all the coins gone tomorrow. What we need, to estimate our risk, is a proof of security. I don't know if it is even possible.

I take a 100k cut for family, pleasure, etc
so I have 900k to invest. How many good investments will I found? And by good, I mean as good as btc. If I found one, 450k on each. If I found 2, 300k on each. Not 900k on one btc bet, but not 20 investments either.

Thank you, Sir, for your kind answer. 
Now, in order to answer your initial question, let me propose an innovation on my own (yes, I am an inventor, with my name on a lot of patents).
What is the problem? A mining pool comes, mines a ton of blocks without much difficulty, in a short time, and goes away with the reward for mining such blocks, without providing a real service for this coin ecosystem. This is bad.
What is the service block miners should provide? Creating blocks for the blockchain in order to publish transactions. What happen when blocks are mined at a fast rate? Blocks contain very few transactions. So the first idea is to say that the reward for mining a block is not fixed, but is proportional to the number of transactions published by this block. If you mine very fast, you grab the reward, but the reward is small.
How to cheat this system? Well, create a lot of small transactions with you own money, in order to increase the reward. Ok, let us improve the variable reward system: the reward is proportional to the number of coins moved by the transactions published in this block. How to cheat this reward system? Well, you need to buy coins, then to move them between wallets to create a fake transactions volume, then you mine a block. Ok, next improvement: the reward is proportional to the number of coins moved by the transactions, counting only the coins that are more than three hours old (i.e. not moved previously for at least three hours or xxx blocks).
I am sure that miners will try to game this system, for example by buying a lot of coins, waiting three hours, moving them, mining one block, waiting three hours again ... So you will need to add tweaks, such as a reward cap, or a reward in log (number of coins moved). Anyway, I think this proposal has some value. If nobody is mining for you, the reward / number of transactions waiting increases. If blocks are mined too fast, reward goes down. If they are no transactions, there is no incentive to mine. Premining is not obvious. There is a chicken and egg problem, because you need to create coins before being able to create transactions, so you need a minimum reward to inject coins in the system to begin with.
Tell me what you think.

Well, I may be wrong. But if btc and fiat were really stolen, Mark would be detained by Japan police. He is the obvious suspect. 
There are others clues. There is a procedure of civil rehabilitation and a comprenhensive prohibition order. So there is a hope of financial recovery. So the funds are not "stolen" and the btc are not "gone". And there are a lot of MtGox btc going out of cold storage.
Those are facts.

*Do you know how easy it is to write some code that can calculate your current balance based on the public adresses of the wallets that you own and the blockchain?* No, you can't. If I buy 10BTC with dollars at MtGox, you don't see it on the blockchain. The transactions inside MtGox don't show on the blockchain, because MtGox is an exchange. To see my BTC on the blockchain, I have to withdraw them (and I tried, unsuccessfully).

Another security question for Bitstamp
When setting-up Google Authenticator 2-factor method, you display a QR code and the authentication key. But you don't tell the user to write down the authentication key, and as soon than the 2-factor method is activated, the authentication key is no more displayed on the following screen (this is very different from, say, localbitcoins, that told me to write this info down, and was still displaying this info on the screen following the 2-factor method activation).
Why do you do that? Do you expect uninformed users not to record the authentication key, and to be unable to access their account if their phone is broken or stolen or replaced? This would be  consistent with your behaviour of arbitrary requesting more papers to identify the user, and meanwhile to lock the user's funds. You are setting up money and BTC traps. I will avoid to have cash or BTC in my account.

"Patternless" means Bitcoin has no pattern, no determinism, no mecanism, no consciousness. And it is true.
But the markets do not reflect the mouvements of Bitcoin. The markets reflect the opinions and decisions of buyers and sellers. The hive mind may exhibit sheepish behaviour, erratics movements between walls built by big players, and bubbles. 
We are not monitoring a currency. We are participating to a social experiment, on trust and distrust, on evangelism and medias, and, at the end, we are looking at ourselves.

Forget the missing bitcoins one second. Bitcoins are making your reasoning unclear. Bitcoin is a strange technology, judges and police don't understand it very well, and don't really care about it (it is not "money", it is merchandise). The legal status is not clear.
Focus on the missing fiat money. Fiat money is perfectly understood by police and judge, is easier to track, and there is a ton of fiat money missing. IIRC, Mt Gox spend 3M in accounting / audit in 2013. So, at some point, this money was not missing. If I was a criminal investigator, I would start by the missing fiat money problem. The fact that Mark Karpeles is not yet incarcerated tell me that he is not obviously guilty in this case.

Let us start with [the logarithmic regression model](  
According to this model, today price should be 713.7, but is ~316$ in reality. So we are under the model by a factor of 316/713.7= 0.4427
According to this model, next year price should be 2014$ (yes, really, try 10^(2.9065  * ln((number of days since 2008 Jan 09)/days) - 19.493) in  and 2008 instead of 2009 to add one year).
Logically, with such a rise, we should be in a bubble, so above the model, by the same 0.4427 factor.
So, my prediction for the price on 31 December 2015 is 2014/0.4427 = 4548,7$

Cool, they will not be able to inherit if something happen to you.
Good idea, the paper wallet printed with a low cost printer, you will be able to conduct a study on the fast degradation of QR codes with time, because the ink falls from the paper.
You can also laminate one wallet, using a low cost service fitted with a high resolution "security camera" with automatic backup of everything laminated.
I will dig in your posts to try to identify you and pay you a visit irl. As there is only one password, and not multiples signatures required, it should be easy to make you tell us the password.
