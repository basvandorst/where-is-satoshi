As the guy who bought at 1200 in 2013 and sold in 2015, before buying again 3 weeks ago, btc won't crash tomorrow cause I won't do shit tomorrow. I'll hold my stash, the one that could have been 10x bigger weren't I the less intuitive trader.

A vey few big hands are squeezing the sponges to make them seem like they’re losing water until they dry out.  That gives them time to buy as many big sponges as possible.

Don't know if it's pure coincidence, but it started on friday with the global stocks surge (following the news about oil producers cutting production). Investors, flat or btc, share the same behaviors.

If you transfer your holdings to Electrum, one of the best solutions, write down your seed (series of words, which is the key that lets you access to your wallet) on a piece of paper, keep that piece safe, and delete your seed from any online file that may contain it (Dropbox or anything).
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:15:44
Damn, I've just sent my coins to electrum.

"A bank without any arbitrary borders, fees, restrictions, or regulations" ? It was already there : higher financial sphere, especially in Geneva.
Can't wait for Bitcoin to put an end to that old fraud.
