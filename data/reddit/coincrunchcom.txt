i am using stripe for CC... Bitcoin enabled is only for U.S. clients
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:41:22
hey julia, its done but i am with gear from mycelium now... i will get back to bitpay if i am unhappy... my suggestion is to not put "account suspended" on new accounts checkout page in the beginning. thats very unprofessional
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:39:29
these are longterm savings... who gives a fuck what happens in a year. its only fluctuating so much because not enough people use it which makes inflation have a bigger impact on volatility as supply enters the market without corresponding demand. if supply would equal demand. meaning more people would use it it would remain stable. right now its stable because demand=supply
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:53:43
looks really nice.. great pic
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:15:14
looks good.. will give it a try
@_date: 2015-06-15 09:26:32
i will be immediately sending out anything that comes in so i dont care
@_date: 2015-06-15 06:13:40
but than you have to run the bitcoind with th full blockchain on the server?
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:11:32
i am upset with bitpay because i implemented there system and then they suspended the account because they needed more documentation on my business. but in their control panel they say that you can give the docs a bit later depending on how much volume you do. needless to say my customers saw the "account suspended" notice. i didn't think thats very funny. and since its bitcoin i rather would deal with some provider sitting outside of the US especially since my business is also outside of the U.S.
@_date: 2015-06-29 04:59:39
nice try to pump bitcoin you american :-)
@_date: 2015-06-15 06:16:30
i need the IPN and i rather have someone else take care of it.
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:32:50
custom... i will take a look at this thread again if i am unhappy with what i have now
@_date: 2015-06-29 04:59:55
yeah its 100% fake.. nice try
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:29:42
setup was fast and easy.. really like this.. and they are from vienna which i also like :-)
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:13:58
+ it takes them like forever to confirm the docs that i send them...
given that i did 0 volume so far with them i think its all crap
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:48:08
i am just going to be testing it and seeing how it works. will report back when i know more. i liked the team from france so i do trust them

phd thesis as far as i understand.. once a crook always a crook. the diploma wasnt faked.. he just copied parts of his thesis from other works as i understand.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:15:37
one must also add that getting so many places to cover their story gives them tremendous amount of link juice for SEO. that is worth a lot to online retailers

there will be only one "master" coin which is the most secure and most anonymous and fastest... everything else will be just for fun but nobody will be interested.
the only reason so many currencies exist right now because countries want a competitive advantage with their currency by being in sole control of the supply
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:25:30
hey.. we just launched yesterday...
good way to stay up to date
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:11:12
you didnt say why.. i would be very interesting to know why you have had it as your first stop
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:12:27
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:32:30
i agree.. could be shorter :-) but i thought its noteworthy for anyone who might need it... it would be good to have someone else create a shorter version

dumbest petition ever
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:34:57
dont say that too soon.. the marketing machine of dogecoin has become huge... thats the biggest thing dogecoin has going for it... and the weirdest things are starting to go mainstream nowadays
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:34:27
i agree... :-) but they set their own prices... with time i will give them direction
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:48:45
haha funny.. i dont know the script and i was sure i heard creep :-)
prepaid makes more sense :-D
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:47:20
not sure.. i was one of their crowdfunding supporters.
but they have been in beta for some time so just sign up and i am sure they will be launching soon
@_date: 2014-07-12 18:14:13
ok thx for the update... i figured out what the problem is .. you have two logins.. one says "desktop login" and the other "web login" one is with just the passphrase the other is with username and passphrase. they open two different accounts. thats extremly confusing because i assumed i am in the right account when it seems i created a second account with the same passphrase.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:00:14
you got the 2 right but the rest is wrong :-D
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:39:55
if you take a look at overstocks financials they barely ever break even.. if it just gives them a slightly better margin it already pays off
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:39:18
looks amazing... great work on those charts
@_date: 2014-07-13 10:46:30
i think its in everybodies future interest to actually stop thinking nationalistic

yes.. i meant to correct my headline... but there is no edit option after submission... 
@_date: 2014-07-06 09:57:53
we figured individual shipments don't make much sense... unless there were a distributor who buys several kegs at once... but through a partnership we fill up bottles too

i have some money in lightinthebox ... that concept will eventually kill all outside of china retailers
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:53:31

@_date: 2014-07-21 09:02:09
i tried running a bitcoin related news site... waste of time. bitcoin people dont signup to mailing lists, they dont click on advertising, they dont click like on twitter or facebook. they are just interested in holding bitcoins so they appreciate.. simple. thats probably why coindesk is trying so hard ...
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:14:33

 accepting bitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-13 05:51:03
interesting you pointed that out.. its very true ...
@_date: 2014-07-12 18:15:51
in general you have to make the system a lot more user friendly.. in all aspects. the UI etc... general layout is okay its just confusing at times. do a focus group with a couple of newbies
@_date: 2014-07-04 08:04:01


you are right.. i read up on it.... fair use is when the original which is parodied is not economically harmed
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:55:06
in a month thats okay... lets say it makes $10 million a year.
if its $20m next year and so on it could make up 10% of revenues. thats not insignificant. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 07:17:36
sure go ahead :-) why not :-D i am not one of those smartass redditors :-D
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:02:33
thx for your response... :-)

thank you :-)

millions could be possible one day :-D
@_date: 2014-07-06 06:08:22
thank you :-D
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:52:09
that answers everything :-D thank you

3 years... 1 year amazon, ebay, paypal...
the rest of the years everything else
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:03:09
thank you! :-) any kind of support is highly appreciated...
if you know anyone who wants to be a guide point them to us...
good for students or the elderly as well :-) or just anybody who needs a job
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:15:03
one thing that is odd about the sites that start to accept bitcoin you can't see it anywhere on the first pages...
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:24:04
should have used the twitter confirmation protocol before every tweet :-D
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:14:34
GHASH.io sucks... you destroyed your reputation forever.
the only thing you can do now is really fix your act
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:05:06
we were the first brewery in the world to accept Bitcoin :-) 
problem though is nobody here (high valley Wildschönau in Austria) knows about Bitcoin AT ALL :-D
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:16:41
you are right! sorry
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:09:39
this is a pretty cool move
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:56:58
they fixed that they are improving the system all the time. no system is fully secure so as long as they keep that there priority i am still up for it
@_date: 2014-12-06 18:24:23


i will go check it out :-) thx

from what i understand is google is giving full access to NSA even to gmail accounts
@_date: 2014-07-20 14:58:52
banks and funds seemlessly allowing to buy bitcoin. which is not going to happen. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 10:43:37
the general problem is that people still label themselves by nationality. which is completely absurd if you think about it.
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:43:10
i am assuming the .dat is transferred on the USB and then your wallet software is redirected there. not sure. as i understand it there are documents included in the shippment which explain it. i can report back once i have them. do you use any other?
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:56:46
yes absolutely true.. but that was kind of obvious from the beginning that it would slow down.
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:07:11
nice try bing :-D
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:51:17
just downloaded bither.. seems really good
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:09:18
okay true.. we started in 2013 the earliest :-D
@_date: 2014-07-04 08:04:33
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:13:32
distribution... it needs a million USD of new money to come in every day.. otherwise miners just sell the coin at any price to cover costs of mining. 1 million USD of bitcoin created every day. i expect the price to go down to $150 before it stabilizes. thats still 15 million USD that most come in every month
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:34:43
a meetup for whom? for the redditors supporting?
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:53:41
i am working on the redesign today. we just launched
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:49:28
yes. berlin is a whole different story :-D
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:34:50
thank you :-)
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:11:43
i am definitely in +10 years... started at 80$. i see it as my pension :-)
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:14:24
thats exactly what you have to do.. wait until the inflation is lower than money coming in .. until that point keep buying then stop.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:27:26
and you still believe you live in a free country.. if you are not upset yet then its really problematic
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:36:29
thx for trying though... :-)
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:57:52
and its the best performing currency in the last 6 years by far ;-)
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:55:59
i know that. it doesnt eliminate that someone is snooping but it eliminates that someone is reading what already arrived. when sending email out you can leave the message on the servers and give out a password. you are just sending the link to the content. so that works if you don't want people to see your messages going out.
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:08:54
i created an indiegogo campaign if you prefer to donate that way. but the bitcoin link is on the actual wiki site.
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:07:48
i agree... as a merchant i dont get any sales from bitcoin yet
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:44:17
most of my subscribers on that facebook page are from outside the U.S. lot of people from africa. so i just wanted the name Bitcoin to get out there... i don't expect people to go and really act on it right now.
so i think for that its pretty effective. In terms of real world use i totally agree with you. but i think there will be much more physical Bitcoins (maybe as tiny wallets) in the future anyway. definitely more than there are now. maybe not in the form of coins
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:58:40
i started this site really 3 months ago... 
i have to fight to make it stay alive... it costs money to run a site.
Chargebacks, hosting costs etc etc... if you are a wealthy person you would know that starting a business you have absolutely 0 possibility to make extra money for living especially without seed capital. most businesses are in the red the first few years even if they become successful later. i am not here to discuss hepays.com anyway. i was just here to help a friend with his projects in ghana. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:45:02
i just gave you guys a green rating ... for the quick response...

you sir are an idiot... while you try to come off as smart i actually found two friends who already contributed... 
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:04:05
down because people need the money to actually buy stuff to live
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:43:10
i know the problem... i had it on one of my domains too.. i would try to get some people to post better testimonials and push you in the green.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:23:41
thats me and i am holding it cause normal people can relate to it better..  its actually Titan BTC 
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:39:40
btw, its obvious he never wanted to donate or anything like that.. he is just a smart ass sitting way too long in the basement...
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:27:57
great.. reminds me of "paypal wars" :-)
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:09:40
there are no finances you bum cause nobody hardly ever uses bitcoin for purchases.
i pulled that address of hepays.com several weeks ago and use it for this charity run now.
hepays is my project and its in the process of changing registrars. Lucie is my sister and has nothing to do with it. she runs her own company. and because you are such an idiot you will probably say why don't you spend your own money...  well cause i have none but at least i try to do something positive in this world in comparison to you

@_date: 2015-07-01 07:49:49
that quote is kind of right... i am huge into innovation but bitcoin is just speculation for now because either you are in EUR or USD.. both are good and safe unless you are in greece
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:46:20
