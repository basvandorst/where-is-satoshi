I think there are many people who jumped on the bitcoin wagon on its way recently (not gonna lie, I did the same). Many got emotionally attached to it and believe it should grow indefinitely, so any rival to bitcoin should be shunned.

Bullshit I say. Computers have been around since early XX th century. Check IBM.

I thought the principle of bitcoin is that its flow cannot be controlled by a government... How exactly can our gov confirm that this and that Janusz Szczypiorski has made a transaction?
Did I miss something?

Sorry but you're wrong. And I feel exactly like OP each time anyone brings this myth.
edit: it was the priests who were scholars and studied stars in most places of our world well until late medieval. The modern "scientific method" of determining theories came up hundreds of years later.

Gold standard is gone since 70s. Until then (and since ww2) all major currencies were based on us dollar.




I'm on a phone, so quotes are from Wikipedia and sources are [there]( under "References".
edit: Cpt. Obvious here, reporting on duty. I am not really sure if everyone here knows that, and they should.
edit2: gold standard, not golden. my bad.

Ordinary people had neither interest nor possibility to study anything. It was a matter to scholars - and the switch from geo- to heliocentric theory came naturally.
Scientific method as we know it now formed in XVIIth century, as it shifted to basing on theories rather than axioms.
We can say that medieval scholars hampered the scientific progress - but the same can be said about the the miasma theory that lasted until late XIX "thanks to the scientific community".
The scientific progress is an evolution. There are elements that hamper it, but these same elements help preserve it from dangerous bullshit.

It's still more of a memething than a statistic. There are many creative thoughts that could stem from it, (like "all these are inventions that improve communication and create a vivid global community", or "revolution in transport, information sharing, value transfer" or even "bitcoin spreads so fast thanks to evolving communication, it's an endless process we can be part of") but all we got is ambiguous "Bitcoin?" comment.
Picture itself is not really related to bitcoin.

Isnt bitcoin effectively a virtual item that has value as long as there is demand? Like hard currency in shitty microtransaction-based games (e.g. LoL, candy crush, HotS)?
Sorry, I'm a newb here, bought 0,02BTC out of curiosity in May and would like to learn what is the basis of btc's potential success.

Cool now everything is Google.

I thought this was r/factorio for a while...

Well, I know it's secure, however I can't see why it would get demand. Fiat is deeply merged in our mentality and most people don't even think if it's worth its worth as long as it can be used to purchase stuff. It bases on popular trust, as its name says. Gold is pretty and to be frank, that alone is making demand for it (outside of fulfilling currency requirements). Bitcoin is on the rise because of increasing media coverage, but that's temporary. There are other virtual currencies. Hell, anyone can be Satoshi and create new virtual currency based on key hashing and p2p userbase.
I feel like some retail and online shops accept it now as it is an alternate way of investing in BTC for them. Once this speculative demand is satisfied, BTC might crash and never regain attractiveness again. I look for a plausible catastrophic scenario here.

And so the speculation bubble grows...
