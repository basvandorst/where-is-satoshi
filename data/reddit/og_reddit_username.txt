Well, the suspicions of you being on cocaine are confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:48:48
Thanks! :)

Your username explains what you're up to. I highly doubt the card belongs to anyone you know, and even if it did, you could easily walk the owner of the card through the verification process on coinbase.

Thanks, I think I'm going to try QuadrigaCX :)

Try to download a previous version of Electrum (not too old, or Electrum won't connect to any servers.). I had this problem and downgrading allowed me to import my private key that the newer versions didn't.

When I signed up with my account I was required to verify immediately
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:44:41
As your account grows older, your limit increases. Coinbase is the best option IMO unless you want to risk losing your money with a sketchy exchange.

I think he means Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:59:49
And? He is talking about a paper wallet. A wallet that has a single address &amp; key printed on it. I'm only referring to it as a paper wallet for the sake of not confusing anyone.

How much is the bonus? In the end you'll probably end up losing money because of the fees 
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:07:00
Man, it must suck to be so poor that you can't even afford $15 in Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:08:15
The key point is that he doesn't want to send his ID anywhere. Coinbase requires verification with your ID before you're able to purchase with a card/bank.

I've had no problem withdrawing. I think the reason his bank account was shut down was most likely due to ignorance on the banks side. He should probably be able to get his account reopened with the correct paperwork.

There are plenty tutorials online. The one I followed was downloading electron cash and importing it that way. MAKE SURE you download electron cash from the correct website. There are 2 out there and I know that 1 steals your Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:16:04
Your bitcoin cash would be in your paper wallet. I would make sure all of the funds from your Bitcoin wallet are transferred out before messing around with Bitcoin cash.

Weird. I'm getting that in Canada too. Hopefully the FBI hasn't stolen their servers!  (obvious joke)
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:34:34
I understand it sucks to get scammed, but this subreddit has nothing to do with whatever forum you were scammed on. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-09-20 09:34:28
And? I'd personally boycott the Erik guy instead of the service he provides, ShapeShift is an awesome website 
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:48:46
There is no option to access your wallet with a pin code. What I think he did was set up a pin code for the wallet app on his phone to protect the funds in his wallet in case his phone was stolen or something, and thought he'd be able to access his wallet from other devices with that pin code. Unfortunately if he didn't take any proper backups he won't be able to get his funds back.

If we're talking about iPhones and the Blockchain app, I'm fairly sure that when the phone is updated to a newer iOS, the data associated with the user-installed apps are deleted too. Since the data associated with Blockchain was deleted from his phone, so was his wallet, resulting in the "pin code" not being an option as there is nothing to unlock.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:12:01
Yeah PayPal is a really crappy place to do bitcoin trades because the chance of chargeback is 99% xD
@_date: 2017-09-20 09:25:59
What is wrong with Shapeshift?
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:32:38
Signing a message with the address means that we can verify its you. Otherwise, you're not fooling anyone.
@_date: 2017-09-09 11:06:52
Awesome!! Make sure you back up both of their mnemonics in case they break their phone or accidentally delete the app (i've seen it happen)
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:41:51
So are you going to sign the message that dmdeemer requested? It honestly seems like you're trying to draw some attention to yourself because of all the recent "muh bitcoin was stolen" stories on this sub.
