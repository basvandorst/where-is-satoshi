My Bitcoin Strat:
1. [Sign-Up for Latium Coin]( (you get 5 for free!) | [How to Use Latium](
2. Invite Friends (each friend = 5 Latium)
3. Sell them at an [Exchange](
4. Invest profit to [Hashprofit Cloudmining]( (they mine Bitcoin for you, takes some time but if you add up it'll be a very nice passive income) 
If you already have some Bitcoin to invest: Use [PBMining](
here's another Guide for [Bitcoin-Trader](

what if bitcoin drops under $100 in the future? no one cares about bits tbh. I don't even care about mbtc or other smaller units, it's just too confusing

GAW defaulted on the monthly payment. BTC.com was escrowed/leased
