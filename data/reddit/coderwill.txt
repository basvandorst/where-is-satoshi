Thanks for the feedback, we just setup a mailing list sign-up over the weekend. I've removed it altogether, and will probably do a link somewhere in the text on the site that is more noticeable instead of the overlay, based on your feedback. Apologies!

Thanks for the kind words!

...should be pretty straightforward on the payments side, they just need your BTC address. you should probably make sure there is a clause regarding BTC as a payment option in the lease agreement though. same thing with security deposit agreement - there are some municipalities that require it be in a separate interest-bearing account (i.e. fiat-backed bank account).

Yes, Xapo is legit - they are also backed by the same investor group who backed Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram. Your SSN is required as part of federal mandates via a regulatory body called FINRA that companies like Xapo must remain in strict compliance with.

Chain ( was awesome for helping put this Hackathon together. Bummer Fortune didn't mention that!

Thank you - there is no markup when converting USD/BTC. Users get the Coinbase spot price.

For each Tip-Up we charge a $1 processing fee - this is mainly to cover bank fees on our side for taking credit cards. There are no other fees, and users get the Coinbase spot price on their Tip-Up.

No, this site is not affiliated w/ ChangeTip - it is independently operated.

Hi! Thanks for requesting an invite. We'll get you in as soon as possible. Also, feel free to message me or email us anytime at support - thanks again for your interest!

That's an incorrect assumption - we maintain very tight PCI DSS and KYC/AML to avoid fraud and/or disputes and chargebacks and to maintain compliance in various jurisdictions. The threat of what you have alluded to was one of the very first challenges we sought to overcome during the development of our platform.
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:57:22
As soon as possible.

Tip-Ups can be purchased in $10, $25, or $50 increments. When a user purchases a tip-up, they provide the link to their ChangeTip profile. tipUp.me then automatically sends a tip to that account in the amount that was purchased.

Hi, at this time, no, as TipUp.me is in private beta.

this is pretty epic. basically, we're talking about a computer that immediately starts giving you your money back as soon as you plug it in and connect it to the internet, then in addition to that automatically connects you with a network of everyone else who bought one who you can sell stuff to. it's like ebay paying you for signing up and then letting you sell stuff without listing fees.

April fools. :)

Thanks for the additional feedback - please accept my personal apology that you feel there is any dishonesty. Will definitely keep that in mind for future messaging - that's definitely not the intent! :)
Hope you have a nice weekend.

Yep - there's three different reporting options that help them minimize reportable gains and maximize reportable losses to compliantly calculate their overall tax liability.

It doesn't cost anything to sign-up for LibraTax. There are paid plans if you want additional features. For most users, our free plan is sufficient to handle their reporting needs for last year.
Thanks for the heads up about the stock image! We actually didn't intentionally "steal" this, but used a meme generator that provides free stock images (according to their site). We did not notice the water mark, but thanks to you have fixed this, this morning - all good now.

This article is saying that even though a person may not have seen a profit holding Bitcoin in 2014, they can still utilize the loss to offset other income (outside of Bitcoin), effectively lowering their overall tax liability.
