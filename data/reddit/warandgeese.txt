The goal here should be to emphasize preventing this from happening again. Victim blaming doesn't help.

The parallels are obviously there. Because there's a limited supply, the more people buy and get into it, the higher the price goes, rewarding the people who got in earlier. New members have to pay to get in and then they collectively get rewarded by proselytizing it to others. I wouldn't consider it an MLM but the parallels are there.

What doesn't it fix? If it reliably brings transaction times to near-instant and near-free then that's pretty solid.

Ethereum is working fine and is faster and has lower fees than bitcoin, I've been using it and ERC20 tokens with no issues during the cryptokitty complaints.

I support you challenging the patriarchy since other people here are disagreeing with you. I think it's a good thing to do.

This should be done on wallets like electrum but shouldn't be part of the bitcoin protocol itself. Proper separation of tasks.
Edit: Looks like one or more BIPs already do this so I'm probably wrong

Look at that image again and look at the [two-year view here]( they're pretty close. I don't think it's going to go anywhere near 30k before crashing but we'll see, I don't know either.

There will be 21 million BTC total, so at $1 million per coin the market cap would be $21,000,000,000,000.
It looks like [in the US, M0 is $1.2 trillion, M1 is $2.5 trillion, and M2 is $10.5 trillion]( So for bitcoin to be more than that it might have to have replaced currency, all money in checking and checkable accounts, all money in travelers' checks, and all certificates of deposit under $100,000.
Alternatively, the GDP of the US is $18.6 trillion. So if bitcoin was used for every single transaction in the US for a whole year then it it might be worth $1 million.
In reality though people wouldn't have every transaction in bitcoin, bitcoin likely won't replace currency, so the total value of bitcoin as a currency and store of value would probably be a lot less than that, even if it overcomes all of its technological issues.
We can increase our numbers by adding all other countries to our work, and we can decrease our numbers by recognize that bitcoin won't replace every type of transaction.

I'd put money on Delusion but that's just me speculating

A lot of people glorify the rich business men

I think the attention just died down and there were fewer people posting altogether, but I don't remember it all that well because I also stopped browsing.

Good point

Support causes that actually need it. Lightning network will either work or it won't, spending a lot of money to speed it up won't help as much in the grand scheme of things. If you spend a lot of money on lightning network and it ends up not being such a big deal then it would be a shame because the money could have gone to charitable causes. Lightning network doesn't depend on Pineapple fund money being donated to it now.
