To play devil's advocate:
A commercial foundation is not necessarily a bad thing. Commercial businesses which benefit the most from Bitcoin may wish to pay Gavin the most, and are better positioned to offer a guaranteed salary than individuals making one-time donations. Competition between members of the same commercial foundation is also not necessarily a bad thing. Without competing interests present, the foundation may simply be pursuing the agenda of a single member, whatever its name happens to be.
Let's look at the members of the Linux Foundation (which the Bitcoin Foundation is explicitly modeled after):


  
  


  
  


Many of these companies are competitors and have engaged in lawsuits with each other. Yet, I'm still thankful they all wish to contribute towards paying Linus Torvald a healthy salary.
What I would consider structurally the most harmful is if Coinlab representatives run out of money \ no longer contribute annually toward Gavin's salary and still get to keep some form of hereditary representation.

The Bitcoin Foundation is explicitly modeled upon the Linux Foundation, which also has a board of directors, and which also has proven successful at paying the lead developer of an important open source project a salary. It is not modeled after a central bank.

If rational agent A wants to build a fleet of 100,000 faster than light ships to maximize its intrinsic preferences, and rational agent B wants to terraform the surface of 1000 planets to maximize its intrinsic preferences, and one of the agents does not possess all necessary capital and resources to complete its endeavour, there will benefits to trade and exchange.
Currency simply means a medium of exchange. If there is a demand for trade, there will be a demand for currency, due to the inefficiency of barter.
I don't see this as being dependent on whether the agents are human or artificial, their planet of origin, or upon their level of technology. I see the concept of currency as here to stay until the end of time.
