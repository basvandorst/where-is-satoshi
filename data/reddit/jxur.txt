No. They can still manipulate the price to benefit them.

A very simplified explanation;
A huge sell off by large investors would drive the price down. Then rake in money(USD) selling the entire way down from where they start(15k&gt;11.5k) to the bottom. Then take the profits and buy back in effectively ending up with more bitcoin so when the price goes back up they have made a decent profit by owning more coins

That’s retarded and I’ll explain why.
If bitcoin is worth 250,000 each and someone trades directly for goods/services as you suggested, it’s still worth 250,000 dollars. When valuing something you have to compare its value to something else. Whether that be x amount of dollars or x bushels of corn it’s still compared against something.
If I trade you some wheat for your tomatoes, my wheat and your tomatoes would still have a $ amount they’re worth even if the USD isn’t in the transaction at all. Same as it would have a btc/euro/any other commodity/currency value. 
What he said doesn’t make him an asshole, and what you said doesn’t make him wrong

Can you please expand on why you say this and possibly where I can find further reading about this? Thanks in advance

I find a trustless, immutable ledger to have inherent value personally.

If they were so wonderful, they’d already be  
@_date: 2018-09-23 14:43:18
It wouldn’t be any good. Bitcoin would be good to hold if the dollar collapsed. That’s the whole point of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is money.

When is the next halvening supposed to be?

Makes sense. Sell gold to service debt, then people flock to it as a safe store of value in preparation for a crisis?
Interesting stuff. How does one find out more about this?
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:25:49
You’re wrong and misled. Google how the federal reserve works and prepare to have a new view on currency

They use deposited money to loan out to make more money. If they’re making money off MY money why can’t I get a share of the profit?
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:49:21
Lol you mean they get bailed out and somehow all the guys up top still make huge bonuses 
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:33:20
Do you not understand how banks work?
Hey bro, let me borrow $20. I’ll hold it for you and I’ll loan it to my buddy and next week I’ll have $30 off your $20 by putting up $0 of my own money. Oh and if I fuck up and can’t return your money my dad will give you your money back
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:36:52
I do use a very good credit union. Still they only pay .125%. That doesn’t even match inflation. 
Google fractional banking and how banks actually work and learn. It’s pretty bullshit. Why should they charge me to access my own money? Why should they charge me to move my own money, in some banks they charge you to store your money there. If you don’t think big banks in the USA are abusive then you’re a fucking idiot plain and simple

I especially loved the part he explained his reasoning behind the baseless prediction

Remember when people like you were saying that when btc was $1000 ?
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:31:11
By bitcoins design, it isn’t open to nearly the same amount of currency witchcraft he’s talking about

Really? I think bitcoin is strong right now.
Robinhood, lots of media exposure, LN getting close to coming out, it’s back down to a fair price and staying stable.
We have a lot of new exchanges on the horizon including FairX and Legolas to attract institutional investors. I think we’re poised for a breakout soon

I really appreciate the thoughtful response and the amount of effort you put into explaining that to me.
I️t is very appreciated.

Explain how. Seems to me you’re talking out of your ass. What political action could help bitcoin other than sec/etf stuff? 
Isn’t John mcafee a wanted fugitive or something? Probably not gonna get elected 
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:28:54
What about that 94% crash we recovered from?
