Mike Maloney is pretty informative in regards to his videos on the market, 
This is a newer one, but make your own opinion about the state of our financial sector.

Bubbles pop and the vast majority have faith in fiat over bitcoin so folks panic sell, which really carries the trend.

Between now and then it might go down but honestly if people are going to spend/buy with Bitcoin it will be on Black Friday. The market demand for them will increase, especially if they fall in price because many folks will be jumping on the bandwagon for the first time or again, refilling their wallets, or spending it on things.

I just figure the same,  I accept that it may lose value before gaining value,  but I'm not going to pump and dump because in the past it has discouraged me from owning bitcoin. By the end of the month my goal is to be 100% bitcoin.

Dude copy pasting your own post isn't cool. I'm on board with shift, but I always try to ask if they take bitcoin first. If your goal is to eliminate your bank account and have an emergency, its a good option vs rushing to find someone on Lbtc. I'm closing my bank accounts and shift card still works w/o a bank acct

Dollar cost average has been shown to be a so-so method of investment, but better than lump sum in many regards. It's what I was doing until the end of this month, when I'll be 100% bitcoin

But currency is fiat, its not backed by anything at all. Even if I lose currency, don't you want actual money? IMO, an economic bubble is currently underway and the next 4 years will see a crash bigger than anything we've ever seen before. If not bitcoin, buy metals to save.

Did it pop?

All I use is bitcoin, so I don't have a pile of cash lying around to begin with. When noobs panic sell and btc crashes it just means you value your fiat over bitcoin and shouldnt have invested that amount to begin with. Maybe someday I'll sell 200 btc or something, but as it stands that's a dumb thing to do all at once and I don't have 2 hours to sit in front of Kraken or bitstamp and hope my sale doesn't crash the market. Even a quick glance at bitcoinity will show you only $20 million at once is required to really throw bitcoin for a big loop in either direction. Kinda silly to thing that while you're in panic mode over a crash, anyone with $20 mil in their pocket, perhaps even a lot less, could start buying up bitcoin and instantly change the market outlook.

About a week ago I gave a free trial of .005 btc to a friend of mine to help explain the concept.
He was hooked.

I buy either way, if your goal is to hold and you have the cash, now is the time to buy. I could care less about what people think of a short term crash, more bitcoin for me. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:04:44
I am still buying. Its only going to go up when black friday comes and the fees are gone for a day.

The best time to buy BitCoin was 2009.
The second best time is now.

Speculating the market is just about the dumbest thing you can do.
