I don't think that will ever be the right move

Thats what I did. Coinbase to Coinbase.

That's where I fucked up. I know that now though.

I introduced my parents to Bitcoin and sent them $10 through coinbase and paid $31 to send it. I felt that right in the giblets, but I'm happy I was able to help them.

I did this same thing

I use coinbase pro to not be charged anything from fiat to crypto. What's another good way?

I would just buy, move to cold storage, and hold. If you want to trade, feel free, but your taxes are going to be a nightmare, and the chances of you selling before it goes up and doesn't drop again are high. We are in the start of a bull run (in my opinion), and it's very unpredictable. Trying to time the tops and bottoms often ends up burning people in the long run.

I don't mind this drop at all. If anything, it's a relief because of how long it was due for. It was amazing watching the volatility though. I watched live as it was doing $200 swings back and forth every other second. Absolute madness. What a ride. I can't even imagine what the future holds.

Never thought about this before. Don't know when I'd need it, but really glad I know the knowledge of it now.

I'm sure others have ways that are probably superior to this, but I deposit USD into Coinbase, and then after a few days it goes through, I move the funds to Coinbase Pro, and then buy through there at the price I'm willing to pay, and then send it to my own private wallet. 0 fees from start to finish, but the downside is KYC and waiting for banks to clear transactions.

Personally I'd say no. The difficulty is so high and only getting higher. Add in the fact that electricity costs eat into a lot of the potential profit and you'll come out negative or break even maybe. Use that money and just buy bitcoin directly.

Try being a bigger asshole next time to get your point across better.

Will this be my first gold. Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z!

They are dumping large amounts of BTC to fund their hash war. Because people believe this war will continue, they are selling now in expectation that it will continue to dump until eventually one or both of them gives up.
