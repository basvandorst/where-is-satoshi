its a diss on Ethereum for fucking the chain in response to the DAO exploit (Ether drained from the common account via a recursive exploit) and then rolling it back with a hard-form (aka "move fast and break things").  the unforked chain (ETC) split out after, continued trading, and is now gaining momentum against the Ether on the forked chain (ETH).  many early adopters/big players in Ether were apparently heavily invested in the DAO - played the fork card t recover their funds, but the general zeitgeist is starting to sour on the fork following the public dissemination of this perception.

No, exactly!  Just the harbinger of volatility implies risk, and risk lowers value.  Now if the "1%" all decided to empty their bank accounts and shovel the money into BTC, it would raise the price up to the point where $1000 swings wouldn't be considered "volatile", *per se*.
Stock example, I know, but look at Berkshire Hathaway's A shares - a $2500 swing is considered "normal" on the intraday chart, and yet its only about 1% of the equity's MA.  With that level of capital invested, as long as everyone doesn't suddenly run for fiat or gold or whatever alternatives at once, the price should stay relatively steady if the accumulation/distribution ratios remain equal, leaving BTC a somewhat better store of "world wealth" (we'll call it) than anything else outside of the reserve asset class.

Do not backup your wallet unencrypted (or at all, just for good practice, just in case) on Google Drive - their default privacy settings will allow anyone with the link to your drive to see, access, and copy/steal your (unencrypted) backups unless you go to the properties and change all your files to "only me" viewability.  I lost my first wallet that I ever had (only 11k satoshi from a 2-FA enabled Blockchain.info wallet backup) from this vulnerability.  It was mostly scary only because I've been pretty comfortable with BTC for about a year and a half now and thought I knew everything - so no matter what, with your most valuable wallets, keep them on physical, removeable and in-hand media, at least until someone invents and implements a widely-used encrypted cloud solution based on the blockchain's architecture.  Your wallet files will always be hosted on completely hackable servers and through sites which may have vague privacy settings on the user side to boot.  Getting hacked seriously sucks because BTC are like bearer bonds - only the holder can fully and truly claim ownership of their private keys...

We have a thing called the velocity equation for money that could be used in a dynamically-adjusting system to solve for market prices in a trustless equilibrium and you're still worried about how much of the "money-stuff" is  going to be floating around...
In the long term, because we could set prices in real-time, it wouldn't matter if the monetary base was inflationary or not since everyone in the world would be paying the most efficient price for everything at confirmation-time intervals (maybe with a first-order Taylor approximation et al to adjust pricing).  The best part is that this 2nd-layer pricing protocol could just be built on top of bitcoin.

(Someone correct me if I'm wrong)  
Basically its the signing mechanism that will differ, though it bears no practical difference.
The multisig address will still sign transactions with a P2SH schema (even for 1-of-1) - a hashed script that contains the private/pubkey pair, whereas a "normal" address simply outputs the pubkey pairs.  
You might end up paying higher tx fees for a multisig (even 1-of-1), as the script constitutes/adds a larger output than a regular address.

The devs do need to do one thing to make it work - implement a change in the code that increases (or hell, decreases) the total supply based on real-time transactional and price data similar to how the difficulty increments work.  In the real economy, you can't have deflationary currencies because the money supply needs to grow to accommodate the transactional value of the economy it supports.  
The BTC M0 can't stay at 21 million forever if its to support a world economy someday.  Keynes was somewhat right in this regard when he wrote his theories on monetary policy.  That being said, this bail-out-the-rich quantitative easing bullshit isn't what Keynes envisioned, and I think most of us can agree on that.  Keynesian economic policies support a monetary supply increase that's proportional to GDP growth, so it could make sense to do something like a 1% yearly increase in BTC for every 3% increase in GDP or something to that effect.  Keep in mind that a small amount of inflation has historically been beneficial to the economy, as it encourages people to buy goods and services, which drives up the velocity of money to power the economic "engine".
The key to this argument would be that it would truly be done in a democratic fashion, with (hopefully then-radically-distributed) mining power choosing to claim the excess coinbase rewards.  The government could still offer *incentives* like tax credits to those miners who choose to follow a currency policy (as opposed to mandating said policy and dictating the money supply), but miners would still be free to choose what to do in their best interests based on the additional revenues they earn from transaction fees.
Ideally, the transaction fees on the network would accommodate the entire schema via the classic monetary velocity equation - higher transaction volumes in the long run would tend to mediate the entire process nicely (as Satoshi intended).  In the future, we may see the type of technological singularity that would enable more and more people to live off capital income (monthly stock dividends powered by real-time financial auditing and recording, interest payments on steady-state perpetual mining bonds - analogous to Treasury Bonds today, etc).  If this were the case, perhaps we'd see a 20 hour work week be the norm worldwide or something to that effect as people are able to work less to achieve an equivalent standard of living with the aid of rapidly-advancing technology.

I've got a close one - taxi medallions (licenses to operate a taxicab) issued in big cities.  The medallion conveys a right to operate a taxi business, and generally, cities only issue a certain limited number.  
Until the advent of Uber et al., they were relatively valuable to the point where they were sold on secondary.  In the practice of business, this isn't *too* too different from something like a bond...a title that enables an operator to generate a return through commerce.  
Obviously its not a perfect comparison in that the physical medallion is not in and of itself virtual, *per se*, but perhaps it points to Bitcoin (and "bitcoins" in general) as being the first decentralized and excludable virtual private asset.  
As an aside, since the medallions are essentially tokens of authoritative (centralized...) provisioning of resources, a future-state system would be simply and practically "blockchain-able" (and with much less beaurocracy required to run, to boot).

Wait, but we're not accounting for an assumed rise in population against a (to-be) fixed supply.  
According to Metcalfe's Law, the network value is proportional to the square of the number of users/nodes participating:
V(n) ∝ n^2, d(V)/dn ∝ 2n
The increase in network token *should theoretically be* (...lulz) a linear-sum game in time with a maintained positive population growth rate.
In any sense, this - at the very least - makes crypto less of a zero-sum game than an unfunded social security pension system (coincidentally, one where the current account gets borrowed against down to nothing merely to depose small-time Middle-Eastern despots, *but I digress...*)

No, its blaming Coinbase for a problem with platform performance, reliability, and trust - especially significant considering this now-joke of a financial tech-services company was formerly the benchmark for the crypto exchange sector.
Those on this subreddit who are active retail customers whose primary platform was Coinbase know what's going on, but everyone else just assumed its more haters talking shit.
There has been a straight-up avalanche of bugs on the platform that nobody at Coinbase seems to be too keen on resolving, with support tickets left unanswered for 1-2 weeks while meanwhile users' liquidity is totally frozen due to some of the issues, including stuck trades, unexplained revocation of trading permissions, and an impossible-to-complete mandated ID verification, which for some, is the second or third round of ID submissions (which...if you weren't going to save the electronic documentation we submitted the first few times around...).
Its gone way beyond a corporate-cultural disagreement of philosophy, with zero acknowledgement or response from executive management.
Go ahead, big guys.  Sit in your ivory tower down in the SF bay with all your VC dollars.  I can assure you that for every one of the ~$85M you've pulled in this year from the VC's, your blithe attitude toward your retail customer base and the associated utter embarrassment of the GDAX rollout will someday have cost you a future customer to match each and every one.

Dumb, dumb response.  You really think that more likely than not, the seller is going to want to hold onto that 0.00002386-odd BTC that's left over afterward, that dust-sum that they can't even independently move off your platform in any practical way?  
that akin to admitting you and your devs don't even understand or at the very least least acknowledge, practically speaking, the whole precision concept introduced with a computationally-operational currency.
admittedly though, the OP's response here is a bit presumptuous; guess what happens when insurance rates are built out - those numbers aren't divisible at 2 significant decimal figures, either, but guess who takes the extra surplus?  and hint, either way, it's because devs/end-users don't do more work than they have to to meet basic requirements, whether that be coding a precision logic into the limit order functionality or yeah, spinning up the on-screen calculator to beat out those USD pennies into hundred-thousandths of a Bitcoin - both sides simply don't have the incentive to go the extra mile and a half.
same reason too why corporations split their stock to increase investment demand (and boost the share price) through liquidity-via-divisibility + compounding reinvestment, or why a 1000-to-1 (i.e. appreciation) revaluation of the USD would have disastrous consequences for global investment.

Furthermore, this request has nothing to do with the fact they're being compliant, it has to do with the project sloppiness and lack of customer-facing communication surrounding the effort.
After trying over 15 times to upload my ID docs, as I was instructed to do by support, trading privileges on the GDAX side of my account were disabled with no indication of why, whether I had done anything wrong, or anything else beyond a 'Trading is disabled' message popping up in the order form when I try to place an order.

Sorry but Paypal was also behind BillMeLater (just Google horror stories), and despite my and others' current frustrations with Coinbase, it would have to sink a lot, lot lower to get on that level.

Right, because you think somewhere in their organizational structure both platforms don't fall under the responsibilities of a single manager or executive?  
Naive.  Its still a start-up.  They don't have enough staff to adequately manage the **support ticket queue**, let along hire separate development teams.

Looks like first comment on StackExchange OP puts this to rest, at least for the objective future:
	
"1 MB per 10 minutes is about 1.7 KB per sec, 2 MB blocks would require 3.4 KB per sec. Anyone who doesn't have several orders of magnitudes more bandwidth than that, should not be part of any online network in the first place (but instead, get a decent connection). Old fashioned mobile 3G or even the lowest grade budget consumer internet connections offer thousand times faster speeds than that." – RocketNuts Mar 6 at 15:55
But furthermore, I feel like this centralization challenge, if it were to eventually pose a serious concern, could be defeated with an incentive mechanism, e.g. essentially compensating (read: "bribing") nodes to propagate at a net-neutral speed.  But then again, I'm no expert - anyone have ideas why this wouldn't work?

This...is actually not a bad strategy, considering most attackers out targeting your wifi...for many BTC users, the most valuable thing they could steal is your wallet file.

Puh-lease, have you tried verifying an ID with the asshat NetVerify software they're trying to use?  I've yet to hear of an uploaded document to be accepted anywhere either here or on the coinbase.community forum.

burn the witch!! (aka migrate+punish!)
@_date: 2016-07-09 02:26:51
for real though, do they not give their devs a sandbox environment (or dev, or test, or staging, and on and on...) to play around with with before just pitching these Hail Marys into the user-facing production?
@_date: 2016-07-14 06:48:37
just curious, did you cross-post on and if so, has it been taken down by mods (yet)?
it seems as though that (competing...?) subreddit is practically the very den of the weasels (CB specifically, alongside similar others) themselves.

No exactly I'm just a normal user, which is why I asked why this doesn't work, smartass.

Sorry, posting title was misleading.  I thought you meant we should stop talking about bitcoin securities and bonds.

good thing you know how to spell 'capitalist', but regardless, I'm with you 100%

Let's poll for a consensus answer.  I just threw yum out there for a potential answer.  Amazon sounds good but companies like 7-Eleven are into online offers too (they do free coupons on the iPhone, etc.)

In case anyone else gets attacked by this IP, I use BitMinter, Blockchain, and have accounts on a few sites within the community.  List what sites you're registered on.  If passwords were obtained through one of these sources, maybe we can narrow it down and figure out where the breach came from.  
We could be using this method to crowdsource security.
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:18:50
agreed.  "wah, they're building programs that can trade faster and smarter than me"
maybe everyone should take a few programming courses and develop their own algorithms instead of crying on reddit.

Obviously you can reroute IP's, but here's the location.
