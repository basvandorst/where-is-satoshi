Roger Ver is one the most anti establishment people in the world. Just because you disagree with scaling doesn't change that fact. I would bet he's more anti establishment than you are.

Yeah, just read anything from Ayn Rand. She pretty much lays it out.

In Economics and philosophy proofs are impossible unless they are axioms or deduced from an axiom. Rational self-interest is deduced both from Mises' work in "Human Action" and Ayn Rand's philosophy (Objectivism). You can disagree with that, but I would like you to propose any scenario where it would be possible for a human to not act for their rational self-interest. Can you falsify the unfalsifiable?

To be fair, I did say "You can disagree with that..." meaning I'm open to discuss/debate it. I do accept it as human nature, but if I'm wrong then I'll reevaluate my position.

Very nice rates, what separates it from Shapeshift? Also, be the first to add IOTA and I will be in love with evercoin.com

Must vary, because I just checked all coins and they were better than Changelly except for ETH which is disappointing bc that's one of my favorites.

I like the fossil fuel industry, although I would rather have the nuclear industry already setup.

They are what people value most at the given price range. You cannot say otherwise or it would be incoherent. You would be projecting your values on others. You may value hardware over software but another person might not.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:16:08
Yes, most people really enjoy those products or software that you mentioned based on price and compared to the competition. Most people love Apple iPhones and Apple stuff in general. They really nailed the software integration.

No, to that person it is superior. Superiority of a product is subjective.

I look at daily averages because a business doesn’t have the luxury of picking when the exact moment they can transact. A customer comes in at 9 am or 4 pm and purchases a product and the business has to accept that transaction at that point. So why the hell would you use one data point in your estimations. “Oh fees are too high, guess I’ll wait 3 hours until the mempool is cleared.” Oh yeah, big financial revolution you got there! If Bitcoin keeps crippling itself another Cryptocurrency is absolutely going to take over. Bitcoin has already lost much of its dominance.

JPM isn’t buying it for themselves. People who use the bank as a broker are buying it on their own behalf.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:33:26
No there shouldn’t. Stop being such pussies. Are we really trying to get the law involved. The law would much more likely side with JPM CEO rather than the Bitcoin community. He also didn’t buy shit, do any of you people know what a broker is??
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:07:31
Stop your complaining you commie tard.

Where is your source? I see average txn fee is about $2.00 - $2.50 on 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:42:08
It does when others are competing for the same spot. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:41:52
I mean like why Bitcoin? The biggest popcorn costs $5 and the fees cost too much. Also, it takes a while for verification unless he’s running it with 0 confirmation txn.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:35:31
Okay, so that’s not how averages work and your experience should not be extrapolated as the norm. I have also had low fees at certain parts of the day and fees up to $6 some other days. A business operates more than half of the day so daily averages are important.
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:09:55
Used to be 10% or 15% I think but since they integrated Shapeshift they are going to start keeping 50% which is huge.

"Yeah, that's fucking retarded."
Well I said what your country does is fucking retarded, more specifically.

Market cap isn't even used to value companies, it's used as a metric to compare the size of companies. It's really not that great of calculation. It is useful, but mostly from a filtering perspective (finding comparably sized companies to benchmark against) and it's used in financial calculations such as determining cost of equity.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:07:42
Wtf? Innocent until proven guilty is how things work not the other way around. You don't prove you didn't commit the murder. What kind of backwards country do you come from?
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:10:45
I feel like that should be reason to hold USD for short term spending and hodl your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:51:32
Yeah, that's fucking retarded. How would you even go about disproving that shit? Do you also have to try and disprove God exists? If the FBI (or whatever your equivalent is) plants fake information into the court case, how would you even disprove that?

Forced them into what they agreed to in the Hong Kong agreement? Lol okay.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:49:23
maybe they bought high? Either way bitcoin should only be bought for the long term unless you are in Venezuela and have no other choice but to use it as currency..
