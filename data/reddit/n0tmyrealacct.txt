I realized something positive. I'm probably just catching up. 
But anyway, businesses are not going to want to miss out on a sale because lightning didn't work. So there will be in incentive for companies to set up their own nodes, well funded in comparison to the product they sell and relatively well connected. 
So, I'm imagining that Starbucks would have a node in each major city with many channels where each channel is lightly funded, maybe $200 or something.
Likewise, Amazon may also put a node in each city, maybe more well funded because they have more expensive items so they'll have well funded channels back to the mother ship, maybe $100k, and $5k to nodes in the city.
So some nodes will be centralized in the sense that they are high capacity nodes. But they are not banks and they are not in the business of making money off of money. And they are easy to replace, assuming they accept lightning payments somewhere in their organization. So they can only stay a hub as long as they don't screw customers over too badly.

I am naive in this, and I realize I'm naive. I don't even know in which corner to begin and I don't believe I'll be the person developing this. But I'd like to understand the possibilities so I could try to figure out different scaling scenarios.
My end result is not a docker image, but a realistic vision of a solution and spreadsheet with different scenarios to figure out how lightning scaling would work if we had a solution where individual or a small group of people set up a relatively powerful node.
I'm well off but not filthy rich. But the idea of me setting up a node and bleed $100 a month. Maybe the monthly cost is more but maybe I'll make a little money running the node.
I think I could fund it with maybe $10 to $20k which right now would be 1 to 2 BTC, spread over however many channels that would be efficient. If that server has plenty of low latency bandwidth I think it could serve quite a few people in a sort of 2nd tier way.
As I said, I'm just trying to figure this out. My driving motivation is to see how I could respond to the statement that LN will make things more centralized.
If there is something to read about lightning scaling I'd love to read it but I haven't found anything.

@_date: 2018-01-21 19:06:52
Yeah, I am most certainly missing something. Doesn't that push other transactions up a level and now the have to pay a little more.
Let's say a person that is a bit more nefarious and with a bigger wallet does the same to effectively block out another level. Maybe not a billion transactions, but let's say a million.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:20:04
You might want to elaborate.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:37:01
Let's say double the current transaction queue, at 20 satoshis.
Or enough to fill the mempool  at 350 satoshis. Enought to push out all transactrions under that level.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:21:55
Will the transaction fee be lost or returned. If it is lost then that discourages the spammer. But if was returned they can do it again.
And they can do it again and at a higher level, thereby pushing everyone else up a notch.
Let's call that attacking from the bottom.
Also, I looked here:
And I think the 24 hour total fee is 24.37 bitcoin. I think that's how to read it. If so, for the cheap cheap price (for a super villain) of 25 bitcoin he can cause serious issues for bitcoin for a day. Or for 50 he can pretty much shut it down and push all legitimate transactions out of the queue.
This would be attacking from the top.
This would be very expensive, but not prohibitively expensive to someone that has lot to gain from the public losing trust in bitcoin.
Interestingly I think Lightning would help protect from the attack from the top scenario because users only need to pay the fee twice and for a large number of cups of coffee.
But still, I'd be happy if my contrived scenarios weren't possible for some reason.

I've been trying to understand what resource usage for a lightning node would be.
I'm not sure I can even phrase this question correctly but I'll try to make it make sense.
Imagine that you have a lightning node with one connection into the lightning network and it is acting as a leaf node of sorts so it has a ton of channels to end user nodes (wallet, end user).
How does it scale? How much resources does it use per channel to an end user? Let's assume that each user does 5 transactions per day (that's approximately the max of how often I use my credit card per day).
So for example, if it has 1000 connected end user channels, it would need to support of course the 1000 channels, but also the traffic of 5000 transactions per day. So the node would have to support one transaction per 17 seconds on average which doesn't seem like a lot.
How many end users could a raspberry pi support? How many end users could an $800 dollar PC support?
I'm not looking for an exact number. More like ballpark.

You might want to try coinstar.
I don’t know the cost of using them, but it might be cheaper to go to the bank and get quarters and buy via them. That’s certainly doable for $25.

It could also be something like Veriblock which I feel is parasitic. It seems to work similarly to a leader election.

I’m no spring chicken so I have seen what has happened.
I’m merely pointing out that we are in a paradigm shift for banking. Maybe of the same magnitude as when the gold standard was dropped. And the banks have to change with it. Maybe even bigger.  Our banks today are very refined versions of a banking system that has been going on for hundreds of years. But the blockchain is not an improvement. It is just something entirely new.

Veriblock is already doing that, securing their own chain. 
At the moment of writing this the BTC block chain is 16% Veriblock traffic. When the price goes up a bit they drop to like 2 percent.
I am now a firm believer that the way to scale is to first make transactions as efficient as possible with technologies such as Schnorr, MAST, Taproot, Side chains and of course Lightning. With those technologies the number of bytes needed is much less per transaction, hence they can cost more and still be cheap. But it prices out Veriblock et al.

Yes the backgrounding is a problem. I think in reality people should use it enough to not be a problem.

1. From person to person. Anecdotally, one of the first transactions was one guy that paid ₿10000 for a pizza. At that moment that was how much, or little, a bitcoin was worth back then.
2. There was ₿50 created every 10 minutes. So at inception there was 0 coins and after one hour there was ₿300.
3. This gets complicated. Not sure I can explain it. But basically the miner is awarded a finders fee for solving a difficult problem. The new coins, the finders fee, is made available in the new block. What makes them valuable and have a limited supply is that they are only worth something if the next block that is mined points back to that block. That’s why it is called a block chain. Only the miner has the private key, or the password to be able to control those coins. That let’s them move them to another persons wallet which has it’s own private key.
And here comes the answer to your 4th unasked question.
How are the coins moved? If you control(or own) the coins you can move coins or fractions of a coin by signing a transaction from your wallet to their wallet using your private key (or password) by signing it. It is basically the name of your wallet, the name of their wallet and your signature (created from your private key). This signed transaction gets put in the next block that a miner finds and this is irreversible and public.

Reading this article made me realize a facet of how momentous BTC and technologies like Liquid is.
It just fundamentally changes how money is transferred internationally. Companies that embrace this will have a competitive advantage over those that don’t. I think smaller financial firms might be able to compete with companies such as JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs. It removes a barrier for money transfer.
No more will it be making a request to accounting to transfer the money. Instead the executive team will agree in a meeting and 3 out of 5 people present will sign off on the transfer. And then it is done.
And if you can agree with a customer or supplier to transact using BTC, maybe against spot prices to keep the valuation grounded to something less volatile.
Mind blown (I realize I’m probably a little behind here).
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:07:32
This is an interesting problem.
Would it be possible to transfer the key to a new quantum resistant PoW before the time lock expires assuming the private key is available.
Also, we have seen mistakes such as selling 600 000 shares for 1 yen instead of 1 share for 600 000 yen. I wonder if someone is going to time lock something for 200 years by mistake. And then lose access to the coin. It won’’t be entirely worthless because because as it nears the time lock date it will slowly get its value back. And at any point in time it should be worth some growing fraction of that.

I saw a very interesting infographic. There has been many different world reserve currencies over the years. Portugal, Spain, Holland, England and now the US. So the idea of changing reserve currencies is not an alien one.
Japan has made ₿ legal tender. I’m not sure whether $ is legal tender in Japan. If not ₿ has better legal status in Japan than the $.

@_date: 2019-07-07 20:07:25
I’m confused. Is there something wrong with what I said?
BTC _will_ be deflationary. But right now the the BTC new supply is larger than the US inflation. Until the next halving, at which point there will be less newly minted than the inflation of the dollar.
It just so happens that the demand is higher than the supply anyway so the prices go up.
In 2140 or so the last new BTC will be mined.
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:43:12
Once things can be priced in ₿ I think that argument will melt away as well. 
And over time some will realize that more work goes into creating BTC than the dollar.

Once people can buy things like that the value of a crypto is not thin air any more. So I don’t think that argument will hold.

I heard you have a lot of bitcoin. How about I follow you home to make sure you get home safe? I will bring this wrench for no particular reason.
But what is special about BTC is that you might have felt that revealing that you had $25 worth of bitcoin in 2010 was ok. But that is what one guy for a pizza, using 10K BTC. And that is worth $100 million today.
So even if you disclose that you have a small amount it might eventually become an amount that is worth torturing you for.
And you might not even still have it then. Because pizza.

The de minimus scares me. It might push up transaction prices since people will be willing to pay a higher fee to avoid taxes.
I heard that the limit might be $600 and if it is then you could save maybe 30% in tax which comes out to $180. So this means that a transaction fee of anything under that saves you money and the mem pool would explode over night.
But on the other hand it will encourage and enable actual usage. It would speed up Lightning adoption right quick.

I kinda hope that this transaction pressure could wait a little while. Like maybe 6 months. I think LN is on the brink of being fully usable, but it could use some more polishing.
For instance, I hope we’ll have solutions to use channel factories and state chains to load our LN wallets. Because if we do then BTC can handle several orders of magnitudes of transactions and on boarding.
If the rush comes to soon people might turn to coins with inferior long term promise for the quick fix.

It would be no less safe than any current mutual fund and they aren’t known to be unsafe. This is what regulation does for you.
Theoretically having your own multi-sig with multiple brand hardware wallet is the safest.

The US Dollar is the center of this partikularitet world though.
The dollar is the reserve currency of the world so it puts the dollar in a situation of no other country. Bitcoin is better for every other country than the US which enjoys great benefits from being the reserve currency and ₿ may unseat it or at least make it less important.
I’m afraid that the US will fight for this privilege. And this fear slows down the acceptance of ₿.
Meanwhile ₿ marches on but I’d prefer faster than slower.

And invest that money on something else. That is why it is dangerous. Their new business model might be a bust and by milking their old business model without reinvesting in it they will burn away faster.
I mean, I’m not a business man. I’m just reflecting on that in 20 years the whole banking industry will have changed. The banks that remain then are the ones that have found new profit centers. The ones that tried to cling to the past will be gone.

I’m really not the guy to ask. I can just speculate but I’ll give it the old college try.
Imagine if Amazon announced that they would support lightning. Node operators would rush to fund those channels in anticipation of liquidity.
For a small merchant it works the same, but it might be an up-hill battle that you have to fund yourself at first. If I had to do it myself right now I would buy BTC off an exchange and send to my node. Or take a look at the emerging technologies for this, such as loop-in and loop-out and channels opened with Liquid.

Microsoft was an incredibly successful company. They had Windows and the Office Suite among lots of other products. They got big.
Then their business model failed. There had been a paradigm shift. They could have fought it. Instead they slimmed down the company and identified a new business direction building on what they already had. But the old Microsoft was gone. But the new Microsoft now has a higher market cap than ever before, I believe. It takes courage to be able to steer the business around like that.
If they hadn’t they’d be the old Microsoft, but smaller and smaller every year.

Aren’t mobile devices almost always online? I’m thinking cell service is more reliable than land lines for the average joe.
There is no chance a cell tower will be down for two weeks. And even if it is, think hurricane, you’ll be going somewhere with cell service anyway.
I think maybe the problem is that it can’t run in the background but if you open the wallet at least once every two weeks I think it is safe.
So, I’m not understanding why the mobile use case is problematic.
And remember, if you only plan to buy stuff rather than receive payments it is risk free anyway because the other side of your channel can only cheat by publishing an earlier state and if you only used lightning to buy stuff then that is to your advantage. Like with credit cards I think charge backs are going to be rare.

If I had to guess Trump just don’t like the idea that he’d be the president under which the Dollar was unseated (or the beginnings of it) as the global reserve currency. If it even happens it would take a long time but there is a cycle and a global reserve currency only stays such for maybe 150 years. Before the US Dollar it was the British pound and then before that the the reserve currencies have been from Holland, Spain and Portugal before that.
It may feel as if the Dollar never could be unseated but I think people in Britain thought that about the pound as well until it wasn’t.
The economy of the US was 40% of the world when it became the global reserve currency and now it is 20%. Of course the US is still incredibly rich but less so relative to the rest of the world.

Aah, not the same as with spammers sending 4 sat/byte transactions.
The minimum fee would have the same effect without the spam transactions. I was hoping that this would mean that the spam would then become to costly and the chain wouldn’t be permanently full with crap which in turn will let the technology catch up with the chain size.
Well, that is the crux of my question. Could that work in some way? In no way am I thinking we should do a fork for this. It is just a though experiment.

This report made me feel crypto is completely inevitable. Not just something people say.
It is long, but at least skim it. It really blew my mind.
It reads like a brief to billionaire investors that got leaked. I mean, it is public, but that’s the feeling I get. I read it with the feeling that I was given information that only billionaires have. And maybe it was but maybe they were given it a year ago.
Anyway, crypto will not go away no matter what the US does. The only question, will the US defend it? Or try to be a leader.
I feel that comparison with the Internet is poignant. Will the US have the blockchain equivalents of Google, Facebook, Twitter in 10 years? Or will those companies be in Russia, China, Europe and Japan? Japan has made BTC legal tender. That’s what the U.S. has to compete with.

Funds move from consumers to merchants. Public nodes will fund its channels to service that.
However, there is no natural incentive to tie up BTC for a channel to a consumer that you might only use a couple of times a year. They could use that BTC for something better.
If you need funds but isn’t a vendor then you can buy inbound capacity. There are exchanges now that support lightning. You could buy BTC from them.
Or you could just buy stuff until you have enough inbound capacity. For me personally I spend thousands of times more than I need to charge back. I’m just comparing with my history with my credit cards. Money comes in as salary, and goes out as small purchases. In my personal case I’d be fine with only being able to spend and use some different method to receive BTC the few times I need that.
But that aside, there are other technologies that I can’t explain that is forth-coming. Loop-in and loop-out and splicing, and opening channels with state-chains and liquid. And channel factories.

It is interesting to think about how this this will affect the average citizens view on their national currency.
They will find that the price for a ticket stays the same price in ₿ but that it is getting more expensive quickly in the national currency.
The powers that may be must have considered this and in a way it is a capitulation because people will now have a very direct comparison of high inflation versus low inflation.
And they may realize that it might be better to front load their ₿ wallet. And so it weakens the national currency.
₿ price is volatile which is a problem. But at least it isn’t guaranteed to lose 50% per year.

I’ve ordered two cryptosteels. You can do 24 words on it. 12 on the front side and 12 on the back. I plan to create two wallets and record the first 12 words on the fronts on the two cryptosteels. Then switch the devices and record the remaining 12 words for for the other account on the back.
And then, not that I’m paranoid or something, but I think I’ll store them in a safe deposit box in two separate banks. I think that’s like $25 per year for a small box. A total of $50 per year for peace of mind is no problem.
It is of course also possible to just use paper. I’m going with the cryptosteel just because I like the idea of a little bit more physical representation than a post-it.
Also, you can lock them with padlocks which adds a little bit of protection against some bank employee getting into the box.
I’m aware that this is total overkill, but I like the idea. And overkill gives peace of mind.

@_date: 2017-12-12 17:41:29
I’ll gain that if someone gets into my safe deposit box there is a buffer of time that I have to create a new wallet if I get a heads up from the bank (like robbery).
If a sneaky employee gets into the box and I get no heads up then there is the brute force scenario.
It isn’t like I’m planning to make the 3 or 4 or maybe 6 words public. They’d go in an envelope stored with me, my brother, father and a buddy I’ve known since pre-school. And I would ask them to keep it as secure as possible.
At least this is safer then giving them the full seed phrase. And the odds that a bank robber will find them is small, and the odds that they will rob my bank is even smaller.
Compare this with having two safety deposit boxes with half in each. But someone reminded me that if I lose one I lose the wallet.
So the safest thing I can think of is having two safe deposit boxes with the same few words missing, and have the remaining with my trusted people.
Then I’d have to lose both safe deposit boxes to lose my wallet. Or all my trusted people lose theirs, and me too.

I hear that sentiment often. My view is that it is not spam for the miner but it is parasitic of the currency. Spam is just the simple descriptive word for it.
Don’t get me wrong. I think the per byte cost should be high but the technology to utilize those bytes effectively is not here yet. Such as Schnorr, MAST, Taproot, LN and channel factories and side chains.
So the spam on the blockchain that has no lasting value for the chain such as Veriblock data increases the cost for transactions that has a lasting value for the chain, namely usage of the currency.
Another example is the Bitcoin SV weather data which could be done in safer and more efficient ways. Storing it on the chain is the most costly way of storing data that is of low value because it is sparse and isn’t verified before it is stored anyway. It is a hammer looking for anything even remotely similar to a nail and they found the worst possible solution because they want their chain to be busy at any cost.
I think that assuming that the miners made the same money it would be better if it was because of transactions instead of storing other data.
I feel that the only reason that a high price is good is because it puts pressure on introducing the mentioned technologies.

My advice, set up a small purchase for once a month or whatever works for you. Don’t just repress it. Make it small if you want. But make it something.
I bought some when it went from 600 to 800 to 1100 and then the bottom fell out and I wrote off my investment. To painful to think about.
If I at that time had set up a small monthly purchase... Because it dropped down to $200 for a few years.

I realize reading this how lucky I am with family and friends. 25 years ago my parents lent me $8k to help with my condo purchase. 
I have tried to pay that back ever since. I basically had to trick them. I didn’t plan it that way but that’s how it worked out. I bought a miner and made a deal with dad. He would get a percentage of the bitcoin I mined and he would keep the miner in his house and pay for electricity.
It ended up with him getting 0.4 bitcoins per our deal. I rounded up to 0.5. And since this was a deal and not a gift or trying to pay back the loan, they accepted. And with bitcoins crazy journey their half bitcoin covers the electricity used as well as the loan they gave me. And maybe it will actually cover the loan including interest some time in the future.

If someone would attack the LN network in the order of the most connected nodes first, how many routes would fail. With the blue line, even before a single node is taken out about maybe 5% of routes fail and you if you take out the 125 biggest nodes 100% of all routes fail.
It’s hard to actually judge how good or bad that is. Well actually, it isn’t very good, but it is easy to see that it has improved a lot from feb to may.
So, the real question is, what are we trending towards? We want it to be resilient.
So there’s many questions around that. For instance, how would the LN network fare if all of China or Russia went dark? Hopefully the effect on the LN network should be minimal.
But that said, the linked chart gives us a great way to look at the data.  Note, chart is logarithmic.

I feel that the word centralization is thrown around a bit carelessly today, and always with a negative connotation. Centralization is in itself not inherently evil.
For instance, many trust based systems, such as banks, are centralized. But LN is not trust based.
Banks are centralized, and they can censor you. LN can not censor you, even if there are large nodes.
But those that don't like LN say large nodes is centralization and is therefor bad. But I want to ask, what are the problems with large LN nodes?

@_date: 2019-03-13 10:44:29
I don’t think that’s how it works. In the scenario given I think the max transaction will be $40.
If the scenario instead was that nodes 2,3,4 and 5 had a direct connection to 1 and 6 AMP would allow a transaction up to the sum of the channel capacities of nodes 2-5?
And then I needs to be rebalanced to provide more capacity to the channels 2, 3, 4 and 5, which now are locked up waiting for the transaction to complete.
AFAIK AMP in itself does not provide rebalancing.
Please correct me if I have misunderstood.
But maybe automated rebalancing could be added as a feature, but then AMP wouldn’t be needed. We’d just need a lot of rebalancing.

Miners need nodes but nodes can run without miners.

@_date: 2019-11-18 01:19:53
Well, if you run nodes then you probably know a heck of a lot more about this than I do.
But my understanding is that all nodes have to hold all transactions because they are part of the network that disseminates the transactions everywhere.
@_date: 2019-03-13 12:19:27
I haven’t heard about such a feature. Think of lightning as an abacus. Once you have moved all the balls to one side you don’t have any more balls to move to that side. So then all the nodes need to “load up again”. That’s what I mean when I say re-balancing. And then you can send another transaction. But I don’t think re-balancing is automated yet. And I don’t think you can repeat that process of one transaction and re-balancing in one atomic transaction.
I don’t see why re-balancing couldn’t be automated eventually. And maybe the two step process of trans+re-balance can be automated into an automated series of steps in an atomic group of transactions, eventually.

I’m not trying to do this. I’m speculating on what might be possible.
I think the realtor service is an interesting case study because I think they charge an obscene amount of money and people pay it because it’ll be the biggest purchase they’ve even done in their lives, so what’s a few more percent.
Realtors will continue to play a role but I think with the block chain there’s a few of the services that they provide that we can replace. Such as maybe escrow. And if they provide less of a service they will cost less.

The mempool is limited. At some point a transaction that was sent will not be going through.

No, it can’t grow infinitely. It can’t become bigger than the number of satoshis, which is 21M * 100M. But since the average transaction will be much bigger than that it will be a smaller number.
There will also be unrecoverable satoshis of a sort since the transaction to use them will cost more than the UTXO is worth to recover them.

The Ledger is designed to be safe to use with the assumption that your computer is compromised.
The entire transaction is signed with your private key which never leaves the Ledger.
This requires of course that you have to read the recipient address on the hardware to verify that it is the address you expected.
Given this, using Bluetooth does not make it less safe. It could send it clear text on WiFi and you’d still be safe. In fact, that is the transaction that is going on the public blockchain anyway.
All they could do is not send your payment and let you believe that you did. But then it is as if you had never sent it.
I think. If someone knows otherwise, let me know.
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:21:58
Sure, I realize that there must be a contract. But I figured that instead of escrow the contract could be that the seller states a willingness to sell and the act that constitutes the sale, such as “This property is sold when a transaction from this wallet to this wallet has 6 confirmations and this offer is valid for 1440 blocks”.
If that can be the legal definition then the moment the money is transferred the ownership changes hands. There needs to be no escrow middle man. One can always refer to the immutable transaction on the blockchain to see the transfer of ownership.

I argue that he hasn’t fully digested what Bitcoin means yet.
He said something like it was safe to leave your money in banks and there is nothing wrong with that.
Personally I’m starting to think that it is foolish to have to trust the banks.
It could either just be a desired narrative by some lobbying effort. But if it is Mark’s genuine reaction I think maybe he hasn’t digested what ₿ really means. As you get yourself comfortable, no matter how you twist and turn, Bitcoin is safer.
I don’t know if I’m right but I’m wondering if this is becoming peoples opinion over time? And Cuban isn’t there yet.
So my analysis is that Mark told us his honest opinion or he wants people to trust banks over bitcoin.
If he hasn’t yet grasped bitcoin we in this reddit are ahead of at least one billionaire. If it was a planned narrative its purpose seems to be a wish to keep prices low in order to gobble up more.

Wow, when you put it that way it sounds epic.
How about this scenario, would the following be possible? Script or not.
A 3 way multisig that requires all signatures, however, with only one signing you’d have to wait a year to transfer the money. However one of the other key holder can go in and cancel that transaction.
Would that work?
I see this as a very safe way for wallets for for instance whole countries. It would be very unlikely to get the money stolen, but it would also be very unlikely to permanently lose control of the money.
I imagine something like a 15 way multi sig where the transaction is instant if all 15 sign but 10 minutes with 14 signatures and then double the time for every missing signature.

That’s what I mean. I think they would eventually be forced to charge. Sure, big companies will run full nodes for a while. But when the cost to run their nodes creep up they are going to have to start making money somehow. Or prune the node and deny requests for anything other than UTXOs.
When that happens the pressure will become higher on the remaining full nodes. Which of course might put someone else over the edge.
But I agree with you. It really must be negligible cost to run a full node.

Forks with the same mining algorithm is a bad thing. I think.
I wish that the original protocol would somehow not only pick the winning fork but also make sure to destroy the loser. An attack now would probably be criminal, but if it was a known feature of the protocol at the outset then the politics around mining would be completely different.
Having a lingering loser is a dangerous thing and it detracts from the value of BTC.

I think it is B. He has people that he could put on menial stuff.
But I like the idea to put some kind of watcher on my hot wallet and just count it as a taxable event when I do. Even better if I could also track my lightning purchases but I think it might just be good enough to ignore the time of those small transactions and assume some kind of average price.
But it sounded as if the problem wasn’t tracking them. The problem had something to do with how it would have to be reported. There didn’t seem to be a completely automated way to then create the report to the IRS.

I agree that a single store isn’t as interesting as MetroPCS everywhere. But we have to start somewhere. Maybe this is a trial?
I hear no mention of Lightning or side chains so it can’t scale. But it might help MetroPCS figure out the back end before a larger roll out.
Is MetroPCS a franchise owned and controlled by owners? That would be the difference between a local enthusiast and an important move by a company.

Once I learned about VeriBlock I realized that no matter the size of the blocks they will be full.
We need the price per byte to be higher to price out VeriBlock and others BUT transactions needs to become very cheap. Solutions include Schnorr, MAST, Taproot, side chains like Liquid and LN with channel factories, or running off of liquid that way c-lightning already does.
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:35:50
The ultimate value is the cost for all transactions in a block, not how many. Having higher prices per byte will also work, but we still want the bytes in the chain to be worth that price.
The value per byte can be optimized by things like Schnorr, Channel factories for LN and side chain settlements.
We want the cheapest possible transactions with a small as possible blockchain with a fee market that makes it worth while for miners
This is interesting, because small blocks put miners solely in the business of mining, not data storage and serving.
They don’t like it because that gives them less control and ultimately the mining share of the money will be less. But mining profit is not in our best interest, miner profitability is.

Here’s why this is suspicious. You ask for an email and a password before you generate the seed.
It would be simple to use this to generate a seemingly random seed from that information. It could even be somewhat random.
Someone with a network sniffer would only see that you sent this seemingly innocuous account information but it could be used to reconstruct the seed or at least narrow down the search space.
If I used Muun my seed could possibly be compromised and I would act as if it was. I’m not saying it is, but in a trust less world I would have to assume it could be. I think asking for this account information is a terrible idea and in particular asking for it _before_ you generate the seed. 
In short, Muun seed must be considered compromised.

The biggest hurdle to adoption for me is taxes on capital gains. I fear that if I spend more than symbolic amounts, like playing casino games just to try out Lightning then at some point it would come back and bite me in the ass.
If there was a solution that solves that, either by making it tax free which is unlikely or a technical solution where you can dump money into a stable coins once a month and only that transaction would have capital gains tax, then I would be a one man hurricane.
I would buy and and replenish as much as I possibly could and I would start asking if I could use crypto.

@_date: 2019-08-02 04:51:36
The satoshi is the smallest unit recognize by the bitcoin protocol.
But you can tie up a satoshi off chain and have a mechanism with which you case choose exactly how much each person owns of that satoshi. It’s like owning a house together and you each own a part which can be specified with an arbitrary precision.
When you want to settle up you have to give it to one of the two participants in full. I believe the method to do that is by random, possibly giving the odds to match the current percentage of ownership.
This is how it currently works. Maybe it could be changed but that level of understanding is above my pay grade.

The reason that ASICs have outcompeted everything else for mining is because they are very energy efficient for mining. The current mining equipment are designed for maximum capacity per unit but they can be made smaller.

I know that when I trade I withdraw as quickly as I can.
When more people get involved with trading, more will do that. That’s what’ll fill up the blocks. Not because people suddenly decides to buy their groceries with BTC.
I think SW and batching is crucial for this.
When we get some regulatory clarity so that people reasonably can use BTC for their Starbucks then that’s a different problem and at that time we will need side chains and lightning.

What I meant is, what is wrong with the BTC SPV wallets?
On op_return, it is data that never again will earn a transaction fee, but it needs to remain available.
With WeatherSV data this is not a big problem. But if we for a second assume that someone comes up with a way to use it as a one-time cost web storage. With the proper client functionality this could even be a plugin in Chrome.
Users will find a way to abuse this. One might think It would be silly to store web pages on the blockchain. But there’s tons of static data even on a  dynamic web-site and you can buy not rent bandwidth. Like, imagine if Google put its front page on the blockchain..
This is untenable of course. So someone will either have to eat that cost, making mining more costly over time, or they will find a way to charge for the access. They could delay it to make this unusable for an interface. But the removal of this delay could now cost money.
[This link explains the problem of OP_RETURN](
I figured it out myself and I found the link only after, so it must be a pretty obvious issue.

Thank you so much. Super interesting.
I’m thinking that there are many interesting voting schemes with delays and cancellations depending on how many sign vs counter sign versus abstaining.
Like if someone starts the transaction it would be with a delay, more people signing would speed it up. Counter signing would slow it down and with enough counter signers it would be cancelled.
The counter signing part after the transaction has been initiated, would that also be possible?

This is cool, but it also seems that it would attract investors of the kind that can’t tell a good business plan from a bad one. So the main business idea might be to finance something and then disappear with the money.
I have no idea. But looking at the report they have a graph that shows the business development cycle and they compare traditional business with crypto businesses and they then mark us being in the “early majority” phase. I think we are much earlier than that so that seems a bit misleading.
It might be legitimate af and just waiting to soar. But in general I also expect that we’ll see eager early adopters that jump on board to quickly and that we’ll see years of bankruptcies that will look bad. I think that is part of the process of adoption of something new so it is expected.

I don’t know if they’ll be successful, but this slow ramp up is not surprising to me. The target market for this are very sophisticated traders that run their own software with massive amounts of cash. They hook up directly to Bakkt’s market data feed and their order gateway protocols inside their colos.
There are going to be two types of traders, some which trade on behalf of their customers. They will bring on a few customers at a time. Probably the ones that are asking for it. It’ll take a while before they, think JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, start first making it available through their products, and yet a bit more time before they feel comfortable enough to start pushing it through their channels.
Then the second type of trader. These are the high frequency traders. They can’t trade on their own in any volume. They need the first type of traders to be present first. They will then jump in slowly and increase their trading volume for maximum profitability. It will take some time because they won’t ramp up the volume just for fun.

If we imagine a network of trusted nodes that use FIBRE between themselves across the world as sort of a super highway, could other nodes outside this highway trust what it gets from one of these nodes as much as nodes that aren’t using FIBRE. In other words, if they fool me will my node safely detect that and act properly?

I have the ledger Nano S and Nano X.
I’d say that they are both very good. The S is as secure as the X but the X has Bluetooth so you can use it on your mobile or tablet. The X is a bit bigger but has a nicer screen. My main gripe with the X is that the iPad app is just the scaled iPhone app.
But I think it boils down to this. If you want cheap, go with the S. If you like the idea of using a mobile or a tablet, X is your choice.
I have the Trezor One and T as well.
I don’t like the One because you have to use your computer to type in pin and validate the transactions. Trezor claims it is safe and maybe it is, but it makes me uneasy.

I particularly liked how he talked about block sizes. He argued that with big block sizes only companies could run large nodes and so they would be regulated and required to do oversight and enforce rules for spending. 
He compared with PayPal which also started as a disruptive technology but which has been transformed into pretty much a bank.
So, the argument is that large blocks leads to control and possibly censorship. It makes it so obvious that big blocks is a dead end and leads to a lot of problems. I’m more convinced than ever that keeping the block size small is the right thing to do. It may cause transactions to be costlier but the chain remains beautifully decentralized and safe.
He said other great stuff as well. Well worth a listen.

This made me realize something. I was arguing with a supporter of a different crypto beginning with a B a while back. He was of course arguing that his chosen currency was the real Bitcoin.
It is using a different logo with a green B tilted the other way.
But with this symbol there is no room to look just a little bit different. It’s black and white and just using a different font or tilt won’t be enough for people to keep track of what this symbol means. They need a different symbol.
So no matter what you feel about technology and project members the expectation people have is that the B sign (which isn’t on my iPad keyboard for some reason) represents BTC.
It feels silly to make this point but the guy I was arguing would accept no argument that BTC was the real Bitcoin. 
We should start using that symbol as often as possible to drive that point home.

I think that the crazy rally the last while was to enable this attack, if it is an attack and not just volatility in a historically very volatile instrument. 
1) to be able to attack the price you must have coin to sell.
2) it is easier to attack if you were able to pump the price first. The higher you were able to pump it up the bigger the drop is perceived, even if the price was artificial. Which also could explain why the price went up so much in just a few days. The quicker you can pump the price to a certain level the cheaper (I think).
3) if you are a miner you can help it happen by not selling your coin. That limits the supply, driving up prices, and it builds up your attack war chest of bitcoin supply. 
4) because of the very strong HODL attitude of this community it is very easy to drive up the prices. For example, if not a single person is willing to sell the price is infinite, but that is not its value. If very few people are willing to sell then it is still easy to drive up the price, and since trades took place it is actually the value. But it is vulnerable and it is only the true value until those pumping up the price decides it isn’t the true value anymore. This makes this community more vulnerable.
Now, the following is pure speculation.
This could possibly be just a good strategy that miners have found to be more profitable. That’s a good thing or a bad thing for you depending on whether you already are satisfied with your holdings or whether you are in the market for more. Whether you like it or not it is a perfectly reasonable thing for miners to do. 
It could also be a part of an attack on bitcoin, such as SegWit2X. Although I understand that particular fork has been cancelled. Let me ask to allay my worries. Is that cancel a confirmable fact or is it just words out of someone’s mouth?
It could also just be normal liquidity for an illiquid instrument. If some btc millionaire decided to buy a penthouse in Manhattan. 
Note, pure speculation. I’m not a btc expert.

I’m all for buying crypto, but if you make money trading then it is pure chance. You have almost no chance of learning trading to the extent that you’ll make money. There are firms with employees that have this as a job.
Imagine trading the dollar. Do you expect you could learn enough to make money off of that?
The difference is that crypto’s are more volatile and you could earn or lose a lot more with the same invested amount. So it is tempting. Good news is that I think this is a good time to get in.
But my advice, like many others, invest only as much as you can afford to lose. And then wait for the long term.
There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. If bitcoin indeed is successful then there is not enough of them that every millionaire today could buy even one. But that is an if.

I find it satisfying that there are more coins mined than there are left.
16.7 mined. That means that there only is 4.3 M left of influx of coins left.
I read somewhere that when all 21M coins is mined bitcoin is truly deflationary.
That’s near 80% mined. And only 20% of influx “pressure” until done. That probably a naive way of looking at it but it is probably not to far from the truth.

Energy can be stored in batteries. Or it can be stored in Bitcoin.
I think it is possible that Bitcoin mining will drive renewables. I think the capacity will follow the sun as the world spins and we will use BTC to store the value of energy.
Hear me out.
Areas with a lot of renewable energy has an energy storage problem since renewables can be finicky.
However storage is very expensive so some of that energy just goes to the crows on good days.
So, an alternative to storing energy is to mine bitcoin and then buy electricity from other places that are having better days. And yes, in the really bad days to buy spot energy from not so clean sources but hopefully that will decline.
This can fund over capacity of renewables.
Over time the competition will be such that mining only is profitable if you have access to free/cheap electricity. The only free electricity we have is overcapacity from renewables.
Renewable power companies will store some energy in Bitcoin.

One technical aspect of Bitcoin is that you have the key to prove that some public entry in the blockchain belongs to and can be controlled by you. 
A bitcoin wallet contains nothing. It is just the private key required to prove your ownership.
This is why if you lose your wallet the way to get it back is to know your private key, which is a 12 or 24 word list of words.
This was one of my early and most crucial understandings.
Before that I was very worried that my wallet crash or the device with it would be lost. And what happens if you have a wallet on more than one device.
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:02:14
Was it stolen from you or did someone acquire it from you in some way, like maybe a foreclosure or repossession thing?

Also, can you track your devices in some way, like find my iPhone?

The Nano S and X is a pretty sweet combo.
I might be stating the obvious but I recommend creating the seed on one of them (new wallet) and enter the seed words on the other one. Entering the seed words is a royal pain in the tuckus but it is doable.
Then I’d store the S with a trusted relative or in a safe deposit box, or some such safe place. When you choose this place the most unsafe place is at home, because one event can destroy both, but on the other side if someone finds it they still can’t access your wallet because of the PIN code. The risk with losing one of them is that your backup now is gone. Not that others have your Nano.

I guess the simplest use case would be that a wallet wouldn’t need to support AMP but if the node it connects to does then it could split up the payment.

That’s assuming that the capitalization reasonably should be 1 million BTC.
Here comes even more ridiculous assumption napkin math. 
Let’s assume a transaction takes 1 second. And let’s assume a transaction is on average 0.01 BTC (or $40) and let’s say an average hop is 10 nodes long. Then a transaction will lock up 0.1 BTC for a second.
That then means that 1 BTC in the LN network can do 10 transactions per second.
I think the number typically compared with is the peak capacity of VISA which is around 40k/second.
So 4k BTC could transact as much as VISA. For one second. After that we have to worry how the BTC sloshes around there and channels will have to be kept funded in some way. Some of it could be on-chain transactions. But there are likely going to be very efficient rebalancing within the LN network. It won’t be that efficient to begin with but it will get better. 
If we assume that the rebalancing will take 10 times as long as doing the actual transactions then we will need 40k BTC.
We probably want a 10 times margin so I’ll wing I and say we want $400k for the network to be capitalized for global use. 
if BTC goes up in value then we’ll need less BTC to keep the nodes and channels funded.
This is of course a very naive analysis, but I think it gives some frame of reference to reason around capacity.
I’m going to stick my neck out and suggest that 400k BTC at current BTC/$, is a reasonable capitalization.

The way it is designed, it is impossible not to.
There is a 21M bitcoin max supply. That’s it.
So that’s what the term 21-million club comes from. It means you are a part of the 21 million people that could possibly be owning one full BTC. It is actually less than that because coins are missing for whatever reason. And in practice it will be even fewer because someone will own many BTC.

If I understand correctly it is mostly receive support. There is some pay support but it is manual, whatever that means.
I guess what it means is that there is more work needed before it is considered fully supported.
BUT it is very exciting news. It means that MPP (AMP I guess) is getting to be the next feature in the backlog and all the features needed will be in the coming releases.
It is also exciting that the main network is becoming the default network. I guess Alpha, Beta and Release is just a fluid movement but with this release we took a giant leap towards production ready.

Imagine that you had a technique to perfectly predict price movements.
Then you would always buy low and sell high. By doing that you would alter the market ever so slightly.
Now imagine that everyone knew your TA, then everyone would buy at the low and sell at the high. But now it’s a competition. You’ll have to sell just before the high so you can sell before the crowd jumps in. But everyone is going to do that. Same for the lows.
Thereby invalidating the TA.
There are only two ways to make money off of TA.
1) finding an indicator that nobody knows yet. But it is an arms race so you will only have that indicator for yourself for a short time before it gets invalidated.
2) create a following and get them to move as one in a way you can exploit.

Thank you for that insight.
However that means that the mining cost for those coins are highly reliant on the bitcoin transaction price.
Which _really_ means that the transaction cost can’t be too cheap because veriblock technology coins would flood the blockchain. 
I wonder if Scnorr, MAST and/or Taproot would affect this in the way that veriblock activity gets more costly versus regular transactions. 
However, it could also mean that the value of those transactions are so high that normal BTC transactions become unfeasible. Let’s say for the sake of argument that it would be profitable for a veriblock miner to pay a transaction fee of $1000...

It’s just annoying that when the entity providing content AND the audience are crypto fans, we miss that opportunity. How can we expect others to use crypto in that case?
I guess the argument could be that we just aren’t there technically. But this seems to be the perfect training wheels use case to start with. 
It may be that the email database is very valuable to them, but I would at least like to have the choice even if it was $10.

In 2140 a few months won’t matter, but a history of stability will. I understand that there is pressure from other coins, but a failure of security is worse.
I feel that forked versions of bitcoin with their increased block sizes are solving the capacity problem similarly to peeing in bed. It’s nice and warm in the moment but it’s going to get cold and nasty in the future. And it is irreversible. Like peeing in bed.
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:36:03
One suggested bill would tax exempt crypto gains taxes for purchases up to $600. In some cases that could up to 35% (short term capital gains) for the gains.
If we have a bull run, let’s say to $20k a lot of people would have a 75% gain and that works out to $157.5.
With a transaction of $600 would save you that amount. Any transaction cost less than that is a savings. 
And will create a BTC crisis.
I don’t want it. I fear it.

For long term capital gains the tax is up to 15% and for short term (a year) up to 35%.  If we have a 2017 bull run then quite a few will have a sizable bill for a $600 crypto purchase.

I think his point is that it is a good sign when blocks are full with only transactions people care about.
@_date: 2019-04-29 04:19:47
I would like to know more about veriblock and at which point they stop being profitable. My guess is that their business model requires that they get their transactions in quickly. Maybe pricing it for pretty certain inclusion in the next block, and if they don’t get in, up the fee to for sure sure make the next block.
I’m thinking that maybe they constantly are at the highest paying tier. Getting secured by the most formidable blockchain by the typical highest rate transaction fee is a bargain.
It makes me realize that maybe big blocks is a reasonable solution for other block chains. But the BTC blockchain would always be full no matter what size it was. Because it is the most attractive way to secure whatever it is you want to secure.
Veriblock would pay much less fees if they moved to one of the forks. But then they can no longer say they are as safe.

But however it works by the end we have a new lightning user I think it would be great.

I'm a HODLer. But once I get viable ways of spending bitcoin I will start using and replacing.
Maybe think of it as me having a savings account and a checking account.
The below is just my understanding and my guesses.
But bitcoin is not an investment long long term. It will be the most stable store of value. It goes up in value now because it is in early phases of adaption. But long-term once there has been a massive adoption for a long time it'll be stable. But I'm thinking that is at least 100 years out. So for 100 years it'll be an investment.

I think lightning will increase transaction pressure.

Ironically I fear that Lightning will cause more issues for the transaction queue.
My reasoning is that almost no transactions is due to people actually using bitcoin to buy things right now. Most of the transactions (I speculate) come from investors.
When Lightning comes the investor won’t go away. That will stay the same or maybe even increase. But on top of that stores are going to start accepting bitcoin.

Yeah, optional. Any LN wallet. My post comes off, I realize, as the custodial wallet being central to the idea.
I just think for a good while a custodial wallet will have the lowest bar of entry. And someone developing a custodial wallet would like a tipper bot to drive business to them, and therefore spend the effort to make a ripper bot. 
But I’m thinking the tipper bot would accept any address, and just offer a link to one or more wallets to get started for those that don’t have a wallet yet.

Yes, I love this. I hope people will sell things that is so cheap that people won't mind paying, like 1 cent, but is to expensive to pay through any other means than LN.
I hope people will be creative about it. Uses that nobody has thought about before. Like grammar check your post, sending a birthday card, reverse lookup of a phone number
Or a collection of specially collected clown porn or the ability to click on a web-cam-girl with a penis cursor.
Or to cast a vote for which is better PS4 or xbox one in an interactive tug of war. Resets once a day.
Or an indie game that is free to download, but to respawn and continue from where you died you have to pay a cent. 
This is the USP of LN, Unique Selling Point. Selling things that cost very little is possible with LN but almost nothing else.
So, if you have an idea that you think a lot of people would pay just a little for but many times then here is your chance.

You could be paid directly on the second layer and channels can be created 20 times cheaper with Schnorr, MAST, Taproot and channel factories.
BTC is the safest asset on the planet.  Safer than gold in Fort Knox. Part of the reason it is so safe is because the block size is small which means that users can verify transactions themselves. For this to be possible the blocks must be small.
It is a bit unnecessary that a transaction for 2 dollars needs to have that security. Especially when it means that the security of the BTC blockchain would suffer.
We can solve this with the second layer (as you are alluding to), and still make it many orders of magnitudes safer than a bank even in a country with minimal corruption. And we can do that for a child working in a factory in a corrupt country with very small transaction fees.
But all of this relies on the security of the blockchain that backs the value of the asset on the second layer. Because the second layer can never be safer than what it builds on.
Most people may never transact on the blockchain in the future. And that’s ok. Because we still get an inflation free and extremely secure system. The second layers of BTC will be safer than most other cryptos and Lightning on BTC may be the second safest way to transact crypto. Safer, cheaper and faster than transacting on on chain on BCH for example.
I’m not share why I wrote all this because it doesn’t seem as if we are really disagreeing on things.

I’ve been seeing a lot on negative interest rates for bonds, where someone buys the privilege to hold an instrument with negative yields.
At some point people are going to think that BTC might be a better alternative. Currently BTC is very volatile, but that isn’t going to last forever. As the market cap goes up eventually it is going to become more stable than national currencies.
So the ability to sell instruments with a negative yield is going to disappear.

I'm eagerly awaiting the 3 lightning nodes to have their production releases. And this is of course a great piece of the puzzle for adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:39:16
I'd suggest that they add an expiration date for non released source code. 4 weeks should be plenty of horizon for lightning nodes.
A developer can easily take that out if they want. But if they do that and don't follow the appropriate forums where protocol changes are discussed. And set up a lightning node in production, then I don't have a lot of empathy for a loss he might incur.

What do you mean that you had a laptop account for payments? Is that a separate wallet? Did it have the same balance?
You can have the same wallet on many different devices and it’ll be no safer than the most insecure of those wallets.
For instance, if you have a hardware wallet but you also have the same wallet/account on a laptop then all your money is only as safe as your laptop wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-07 22:07:07
I agree with your goal but not your reasoning.
More decimals would make on chain transactions more expensive thereby making the coin less valuable because it has less utility.
But I don’t think this is a huge problem. Compare with using an ATM. You can only withdraw twenties. But when you go to the store you can spend far less than that.
It’s the same with a satoshi. You would have to withdraw at least one satoshi from the chain. But with side chains and lightning you can use fractions of that in stores.

You seem to have a great understanding about all this stuff, are you working on blockchain software, or one of the lightning implementations?
Ok, so my understanding  of LN is this.
1) If you ever only send from a channel then you are always safe, online or not. The remote node could close the channel but only to a previous state and any state other than the last is to your advantage.
2) If your wallet/node doesn’t go offline for a long period, like 2 weeks, you are also safe.
And with safe I mean safe with the full force of the encryption power of your key.
The caveat to this is that if you are using a software hot wallet for your signing then you are only as safe as that. But could it technically be secured by hardware signing?
Edit: Adding to 2) or use watch towers.

I think Bitcoin has the opportunity for one more non contentious hard fork where the old chain will just die. And that’s when we are forced to go to quantum resistant PoW.

Well, that is my reasoning.

There'll be pent up pressure at some point. Probably small stores jumping on board.

For me the major factor holding me back is that I don’t want buying a pack of gum being a taxable event.
What I need is legislation or a technical solution that fixes this.
Technical solutions could be using a stable coin solution which because of coin stability would be exempt. Or it could be an automatic tax solution where my wallet automatically helps file the taxable event.
Or it could be legislation that removes capital gains tax.
When one of those are in place I would use crypto wherever and whenever I could.
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:55:14
You are using words such as still and not solved yet.
You are right. It is complicated to solve this problem well and it will take time. It would be easier to just raise the block size. That would give us a good solution for now at the price of never being great.
We could in fact go with the BSV unlimited size strategy for even better throughput but an even more short term solution.

Your own hardware wallet is the safest option if you know what you are doing.
If you are only going to buy a little bit then it might be a better option to keep them on an exchange. There are many reputable exchanges in the US that you could trust with that amount, I use Coinbase but I think Gemini is a good option too.
People like to say not your keys not your coin. What they mean is that the exchange could prevent you from using your money. That is a real risk. But on the other hand, with your own wallet, software or hardware you could be scammed.
So you have to weigh the risks of being scammed against the exchange stealing your money.
I think when you first start out, keep it on the exchange but create a small wallet and transfer ₿ to it and get used to handling it. I’d suggest making sure that you can restore the wallet on a different device before you put any serious money on it.
And then when you get comfortable you’ll likely know enough to make your own choices. For hardware wallets Trezor and Ledger are the two most popular ones. Unfortunately they will eat up a large amount of the capital that you are planning to invest so that might be something you do later.

Square has point of sales systems right? Currently I don’t think that BTC is one of the promoted payment options. It’s still credit cards.
I find this interesting in the sense that Dorsey clearly likes BTC and the fact that it not yet is an option is not for a lack of will or interest.
I also speculate that the reasons aren’t technical. Which leads me to my point. I think the reasons are of a legal nature like for instance capital gains tax.
In spite of some calling their crypto “cash”, no crypto is yet viable as a large scale currency. Because who wants to create a capital gains line item for buying a pack of chewing gum?
There are exceptions where there is no capital gains tax but those are rare. But in those places they are a usable currency. In the rest of the world cryptos are mostly a store of value regardless of how easy or cheap it is to transact.

Nothing. I’m confident in my and everyone else’s inability to predict the market based on historical data.
I think we can make guesses based on fundamentals, such as supply and demand. We know the supply is going to go down. What we don’t know is how much the market already has priced that in and we don’t know what the demand is going to look like in the future.
I’m betting that the demand will go up. The halving is one factor. In my mind the bigger unknown is legislation in the US. There will be new legislation and there is some kind of expectation on what that legislation will look like. The unknown is whether this legislation will be disappoint or impress investors and users. We also don’t know when this legislation will arrive.

Bakkt is for institutional trading and this is not like trading on a web GUI.

So, bottom line, we can’t rely on the bitcoin core behavior of transaction propagation because a malicious actor could just do away with that behavior. 
But the more nodes we have the harder it would be to pull this off. And the bigger the blocks the fewer the nodes we will have.
So, big blocks makes 0-conf less safe.
And truly the only safe solution is waiting for some chosen number of confirmations.
And RBF just makes it possible to pull off this attack without having to inject malicious nodes. However, the RBF attack vector is only a problem if you mark a transaction RBF and the receiver doesn’t wait for confirmations, which obviously should be prevented by the receiving wallet software. 
The (Bit)coin just dropped i think. Am I understanding this correctly?

Right now BTC is safer than any other asset on the planet.
Cheaper to transact comes later. Even if it was free to transact the legal framework to use BTC as an every day currency is not there yet.
So therefor transaction cost is not our current problem. However once the legal framework is done the transaction pressure will be brutal. So it is a pressing problem but not a current problem.

It is much easier to create a good user experience with a custodial solution. The user doesn’t have to worry about channel creation or inbound versus outbound capacity.
In an ideal and honest world there really is no disadvantage. But in reality it has all the issues of a bank, such as lack of privacy as well as requiring trust.
A non custodial solution is a better end game. But it is much more complex. This matters at this point in time because it’ll take some time to get Lightning to be mature. But in a hundred years nobody will probably even remember the short moment in time where custodial wallets was a thing.
But for the time being, custodial wallets fills a purpose, so here’s 100 sats.

@_date: 2018-04-09 20:26:54
I don’t think it is what I think banking is. I think it is a general list of problems because of centralization. And I don’t know what that list.
If someone had that list we could go trough the issues one by one and rate LN against each of those issues.
For instance, I think one of the issues with centralized banking is high rates because you don’t have many alternatives. I think LN doesn’t have this problem because if one node starts charging to much then it becomes profitable to compete with them and an alternative will pop up. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:57:37

Ok, cool. Ty.
I asked because I also worry about the cost of running a full node. The cheapest you can buy big storage today is about $100/TB. I realize that it’s going to get cheaper over time but bch relies on it to fulfill the goal of decentralization.  If one asks a bch fan about that risk it gets swept under the rug.
I was not aware of the block propagation issue. How does that affect decentralization? Bigger miners have bigger inter tubes and can get stare d quicker and get an advantage that way?

Can you describe what a bridge node is?
What would the numbers look like if you removed nodes randomly instead of focusing on the nodes with the largest connection count?
Alternatively, what happens if you remove nodes in the opposite fashion, the nodes with the least number or connections?
I think this is a pretty interesting scenario because smaller nodes are more likely to fall over. Many small nodes might be home servers susceptible to power outages.
And may also be more susceptible to denial of service attacks.

Item 3 is not true.
I bought a cryptosteel and they came organized with little compartments exactly like yours does.
I find it unlikely that you happened to choose exactly the design that they did.
The laser engraving sounds like an improvement and I'd be an interested consumer but to the best of my ability it seems like you are lying to make your product look better. And I don't reward liars.
So, explain yourselves.
For consumers, Trezor.io has the original. 
edit: I'm amending my statement above. I feel this was an unfortunate series of events (with me receiving a later generation cs that seems to have had that packaging issue resolve) and not some kind of purposeful dishonesty. I wish this product well.

Ok, you seem sincere.
However, my cryptosteel arrived with not a single tile in the wrong compartment (that I found) so I would remove the statement that says "they come all jumbled up" to something talking up how well your design works in this regard without talking down the crypto steel.

I think they'll be late to the game.
Let me illustrate. I was going to buy a lighter. Xikar is a brand I like. They have a web store so I want there to find my lightter. But then I realized that I would have to create and account, type in my address and credit card (which is in a wallet somewhere else).
So, I went to Amazon, found the product and ordered from there.
Having the credit card and address of a customer is a giant advantage. It ties my purchasing power to them. And they probably have some really great deals with the credit card companies. Much better than Xikar.
If I instead have an LN wallet, and have a way to both approve a purchase and also choose the shipping address from my device. Auto fill is pretty close, but there it should be possible to do something much more elegant. Maybe you type it into your LN wallet once and for all and there is a hand shake between the site to tie the purchase to the address.
Then there would be very little resistance to buy something from their site. Having an account would be optional.
So if I'm right Amazon will resist until they have no choice. That's the bad news. The good news is that smaller product web sites will have a better chance to compete against large companies.
Imagine one item producers, like cryptosteel maybe. A web site with only one product is viable now. 
Amazon still has 99 advantages, but an account ain't one.

Ok, here’s why this don’t worry me.
TA like this can’t work, because if it did it would move the market before the descending wedge happened in anticipation. So then we’d have to come up with new TA that takes that into account, which then would move the market because this new anticipation. Ad infinitum. Any known TA can’t work for this reason.
The only kind of TA that might work is TA that you and I don’t know anything about. And even shops that employ teams of PhD’s to do this are seldom successful.
TA is like a war, the moment you figure out a winning strategy and use it, it will stop working. And the strategies we read about in these forums stopped working in the 50’s.

When/if we get close to ATH, and possibly shoot right past it, then BTC prices will be news worthy.
The author is right though that there’s a lot of people that doesn’t need to search bitcoin specifically. But maybe some will google “Bitcoin Microsoft identity”

Well, you can pay AT&amp;T bills with BCH now. And currently it is the better option than using BTC because of fees.
And for now BCH is really the better option until LN becomes ubiquitous. Of course the BCH scaling solution is like peeing in bed, nice and warm now but it’ll get nasty fast. And this re-org is one of those examples. However, the average AT&amp;T user don’t know anything about that.
This comment is made in the context of the user experience of paying a $70 bill for the casual user. Big blocks solves the capacity problem the same way that peeing in bed does when you are cold. It gets nice and warm but it is a terrible long term solution. There is no need to explain to me why BTC is better than BCH.

I’ve tried both and I prefer both Nano S and Nano X over Trezor One and Trezor T.
Entering the seed phrase on a Ledger is torture though. It’s a trial of fire that tests your mettle.
But after that is done I prefer the Ledger.
Trezor one I don’t like because you have to type in the pin on the computer. Trezor T is much better. I’d even call it good. Except my sausage fingers can’t hardly type in the pin code on that screen for ants.
With the Nano X I have only one real gripe. The ledger wallet app for the iPad is just the scaled iPhone app. Well, I have a minor bonus gripe as well, the X rattles a bit. Doesn’t affect function, but it’s not something you expect for a device this price.
But those aside, it having Bluetooth and working with mobile devices is super.

My comment was a bit unclear. I meant it was the better option for paying small bills.
My fear is that BCH will gain acceptance in this critical moment of Bitcoins development. The moment when it is to expensive to use for small transactions but before LN is ready.
They have a value proposition that is going to evaporate in the next few years. But if they become a standard option in many places we will have to live with that manure for a long time.

I’ll add to your list of gripes.
It does not support the iPad natively, only the stretched iPhone version. It’ll still work but it feels very clunky.
It does not list the counter value per ETH (or any crypto). It’ll list the total value for your account but sometimes I’d just like to see the per coin value so I can compare with other sources.

When they are amazed at how fast it is I wish they would tell is if they are connected to a random node or to the same node as the store.
This speed could be very impressive or very meh depending on how they are connected. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:41:15
I’m 100% with you.
I have owned The Trezor one but the fact that the pin code could not contain the number 0 just turned me off. I set it up to see if it would redeem itself but no.
I also got the Trezor model T. It is nicer and I like Trezor as a company, however the screen is to small to reliably enter the pin code. I’d rate this one with a good but not for people with sausage fingers.
I have the Ledger Nano S and I also like it. I find the navigation system is fast and reliable. Entering seed words is a pain but you don’t have to do that often.
I also have a Nano X on its way. I can’t review it but I’m very hopeful for that one. The coolest feature of the X is of course that it can work over Bluetooth. I’ve wondered if that is safe, but my current understanding is that it is. I think hardware wallets are designed such that your funds are safe even if your computer is compromised as long as you check the addresses on the device. So then Bluetooth is safe for the same reasons as long as you check the transaction you are signing.

It could be limited by the capacity of secure elements. And I wouldn’t be surprised if that capacity increased in the last few years so Ledger could now use a bigger and better secure element.

You are right they are different. But they can also make HW keys safer.
Right now I have some amount of trust that my HW key doesn’t have some kind of backdoor. But some kind of backdoor attack of a multisig with one part signed by a Trezor and one by a Ledger is just not likely to happen.
After having read the article I think that I might do that for my cold storage with a 2 out of 3 multisig. But not until it becomes more main stream.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:41:41
Wow! That is absolutely fantastic.
This is a super cheap way to get all the hardware needed to accept payments.
I wonder what kind of devices that will pop up from this. I guess some things will just be replaced, like maybe some vendor machines.
But it also opens up a market for really small payments. Something you’d really only would be prepared to pay a few cents for. I think the limit really will be the time it takes to pay for whatever you are buying even if it just is a few seconds.

You all are displaying a lot of bravado. Like, they can’t ban bitcoin.

Very good advice.
My plan is the hardware wallet in a safe deposit box and just petty cash available from home.
As long as I have and make fiat I can transfer to my cold wallet without being able to withdraw from it. I only need physical access to it when I need to withdraw from it.
So a threat against my physical person will likely get you nowhere. They’ll have to let me walk into a bank with cameras and people. The bigger concern I have is that if they kidnap someone near and dear to me then my personal security doesn’t matter.
So, the over arching best practice that everyone rightly is putting forth is stealth. Don’t brag.

Here’s a few options.
If you have an android phone you can use your nano with a special cable (not Ledger specific, but to use the phone as a USB server rather than a USB client).
I don’t think this works with Apple but that is apples fault for how it supports USB.
You are probably not wanting to drop money for a ledger right now, but if you did you could get a Ledger Nano X which will use Bluetooth and will work with both iPhones and iPads.
Finally, you could install Linux onto your old PC and run ledger on that.

Back then it was going towards an all time high. Every single person who bought Bitcoin became richer by very quickly. And we didn’t know where the limit is. “$6k? ridiculous, when will this end” “$9000 9000!!!” “$13k, this is legit crazy” $17k, where will this end? Nobody knows”. “$19.5K, when will this end? NEVER”. “Two weeks later, 1 BTC = 4 cents. Oops”
Now it’s different. A large group of people are still hurting from the previous crash. They are not becoming richer than they’ve ever been. They are recouping their losses. Their happy, but it still hurts. At $20k we are all richer than we’ve ever been so that is the first emotional step.
The 2017 bull run saw the price go from $1000 to, for one second, $20k. I think people are sort of expecting/dreaming for the same to happen again.
The next ATH would have to go to $3k * 20 = $60k before we reach the same level of incredulity as last time.
So, in peoples minds we are only in the baby bull run stage yet. We’re not even sure if it is a bull-run. We are so used to hurting that it is hard to truly become optimistic.
Well, that’s just my 2 Satoshis

Is this solution perfect? No it isn’t.
If I’ve understood correctly it is custodial, KYC and the vendor never sees BTC.
But it is a step on the way and it won’t destroy the memory pool. And it makes BTC viable for one more use case. This is great for adoption. It’s a huge leap forward for people to get paid in BTC.
I’m interested in using this myself. My only concern is how to handle taxes. Do I really have to keep up with capital gains tax for every grocery store trip? I need some kind of solution for that.
Either tax exemption for smaller purchases or some kind of automated capital gains tracker in the app that is simple to add to your tax declaration. I don’t mind if the IRS get’s a list of capital gains events for my chewing gum purchases as long as it can be done without paper involved.
