So with the system being discussed, I can use my private key to generate a signature, and the public key can be used to verify that the signature was generated from the private key? 
I take it the math working behind this works differently than, say, https connections? Again I'm no expert.

So I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to this sort of thing. I understand public key cryptography and how it works in many contexts, but not PGP.
Wouldn't all of these keys mentioned in the article be the *public* key, ie. the key used to lock a message to send to someone, in this case Satoshi?
Or are these some other sort of key, used to verify that the sender of a message is who they say they are? If that is the case, how does that work?

I have a question about how reddit works. Is there a way I can block all posts that include any of the following criteria from showing up on my homepage?
- URL contains "
- Post title contains "AndreasMAntonopoulos"
- This guy's fucking widow's peak thumbnail.

Hey, I was in this same coffee shop when this was posted to reddit! I feel so connected to you, OP. I've sat at that table, too.

I actually didn't pay in bitcoin. But still! It's cool to see one of your favorite places on reddit while you're there.
You wouldn't happen to have been the woman with the "Bitcoin: decentralize all the things" sticker on her laptop?
