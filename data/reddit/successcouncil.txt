The 3 biggest complaints from mainstream about about Cryptocurrenices have been solved.
1.	A stable cryptocurrency
2.	An entire Smartcontract decentralized ecosystem with minimal reliance on third parties, and
3.	A way for everyone to earn coins without any large investments or technical know how.

I see bitshares as critical infrastructure to secure bitcoin. Bitcoin is resilient to any attacks by force. But the key bitcoin infrastructure, like bitpay, coinbase, bitfinex, coinapult, etc, are vulnerable. I think you will see in the next year or two, all of those businesses will put large portions of their functionality on the bitshares decentralized exchange, thus making the entire bitcoin eco-system resilient to attack. Then innovation without permission will take another huge leap forward.

You are missing the point.  It will be sufficiently decentralized (even more so than bitcoin) and at less the 5% of the cost.  Plus the rewards for creating blocks is far less so there is no need to "envy" delegates. It is not that desirable a job.

Regulation does not protect consumers.
This is a big topic and will not be settled with slogans.  For those genuinely interested in understanding why they do not, watch this video by Milton Freidman.  It shatters another myth.  Regulation protect workers.
As this video expertly and exhaustively demonstrates, Workers are not protected by regulations or Unions for that matter. They are protected by competition among Employers. Likewise bitcoin consumers will be protected by many competing exchanges and wallet services.  All regulation creates barriers to entry and restricts competition therefore, all regulation (except that which prohibits fraud) hurts consumers.
If you understand the workers argument you will understand the fallacy of the consumer argument as well.

Eric, the collateral does not need to be gold or USD.  For example you may want to lock $100 worth of bitcoin.   I may want to leverage my bitcoin.  Therefore I could put up  $200 of bitcoin as collateral.  
The limitation is you are only protected from a 50% bitcoin price drop.
I like Locks, and I think the UI is the best and easiest one out there.  When you guys designed locks there was not a trustless environment to hedge bitcoin price.  But there is now.   Perhaps in the future you may  integrate your system with one so that your customers can keep their own private keys and eliminate third party risk.
Above I posted a video where I compare locks to other products, but I will post it here again.

Hey Sgornick.   
Thanks for your post. Great points. To be clear I am not suggesting that bitcoin is on the verge of vulnerability and will soon collapse.  I think your points are valid and a successful attack is near impossible. I think bitcoin is very secure and I hold way more bitcoin than any other crypto. 
What I am suggesting is it either is possible or will be very soon to have the same or more level of security for less than $650 million dollars.

HI Ilogy,
Thank you for the post.   Some great points that I had not considered.  IS there a way to move this thread to the top?
I don't agree with everything you said. Especially on the invalidity of regression theorem however your point on POW eliminating competition by its nature is brilliant.  I had not thought of it.  
However, now the question is raised? Is it advantageous to have 1 dominant currency to the exclusion of all others?
On the surface there is a convenience factor, and even a bias towards that reality because the State dictates to us what currency we shall use, but beyond that I cannot see any other advantages.
On the flip side I see competition is generally tremendous for innovation, as well as making systems resilient.   This point actually makes DPOS even more resilient than first though. IF a single DPOS coin is more decentralized than bitcoin... how much more decentralized is many of them?
We start to get into Smart wallet discussions at this point as to whether it is practical or not.
But certainly in concept there is nothing offensive about going to a shop and finding it is priced in Apple stock, Amazon stock, and Alibaba  stock.  Likewise it would be fine to see goods priced in BitsharesX BitsharesY and BitsharesZ
@_date: 2014-09-16 09:45:50
I agree.  Let me be clear. I am not in the least bit interested in bringing bitcoin down.  Nor do I think it will be brought down. I own more bitcoin than any other crypto.  I want to see it go to the moon.   It will go to the moon faster if we can create a more efficient algo.
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:19:02
It is not the cost that defines security.   You would agree 1 person spending $650 million dollars on a single mining farm is much less secure than 650,000 people spending $1000 on mining.   Among other factors, the question is how much decentralization bang for your buck do you get?
Sadly as POW scales it tends towards decentralization.

@_date: 2014-09-17 13:59:16
1) agreed.
2) rising prices have historically always attracted more buyers to bitcoin than flat or  falling prices.
3)Inflation is always destructive, though in the case of POW it is also necessary.  If that rock from Mars was infinitely divisible then inflation would be bad.
3b) Actually you do need the price to skyrocket.  Since you cannot expand the supply above 21 million, then in order to have enough value to go around, the price must explode to have a market cap in the trillions and be a global currency

You would agree that 1 person spending $650 million of mining is a lot less secure than 650 people spending a million each on mining right? the question at hand is how much decentralization bang for your buck do you get.   Sadly as bitcoin scales and spends even more on security it is centralizing.
With DPOS, the decentralization bang for your buck is significantly better.

There is an incorrect assumption in here.   Each miner must be able to run the entire network or else they cant mine. (Remember each block is mined by one miner at a time.) The size of the network is irrelevant to how many miners there are. The number of miners only relates to decentralization.

It will be interesting to watch... True bitcoin has plenty of plasces it could improve and there are a number of other algo's out there already better than bitcoins POW.  But network effects are very valuable.
Alt's have to be significantly better to topple bitcoin.  Look at the Qwerty keyboard. It was specifically designed to slow typists down on daisy wheel type-writers.  Better keyboard designs can't topple something that was specifically designed to be terrible for todays uses.  That is the power of network effect.   It is a huge hurdle for alt's to jump.

I dont think you are the type of person to actually be curios and learn, but for the others out there.
Its not magically true it is just provably true.
And you make being it sound a like a delegate/miner can arbitrarily make and change transactions.  All a delegate or miner can do is include a transaction in a block or not. If they don't the transaction will just get picked up by the next delegate 10 seconds later. A delegate is a low level employee with very little trust required. McDonalds built a system so sound that it can run on 16 year old minimum wage earners. Blockchain technology achieved the same. You don't need to be a genius or that trusted to be a miner or a delegate. You certainly do not need to pay $650 million dollars a year to a dozen or so mining farms.

I say... the internet makes everything better right? Email is better than sending letters, Google is better than card catalogs at a library and netflix is better than blockbuster. But we dont have internet money.  It turns out there was a really good reason. There is a 3,000 year old problem called the Byzantine Generals problem that made trusting anonymous people impossible. For example... How do I know you didn't copy  your internet money and send it to someone else before you sent it to me? Well this 3,000 year old problem just got solved a few years back by some genius and now we have magic internet money. Soon the whole world will be using it.
I then normally go onto to say....
There are lots of amazing things magic internet money can do but the thing I like the most is it is helping poor people. I didn't know this but 10% of America is unbanked. Meaning banks won't give them accounts for one reason or another....perhaps they are homeless and do not have an address. When these guys get a paycheck they can't deposit it and have to go to a payday loan shark who will cash it for a 30% fee. Magic internet money allows even the poorest homeless person to have a bank account for this money and spend it without banks and payday guys stealing 30% of it. Now as good as that is for America, its even more amazing for these poor souls in say Africa where up-to 80% of the population are unbanked. Bitcoin is going to big time reduce  poverty!

No one is suggesting that governments are on the cusp of launching such an attack. What I am suggesting is that we are spending $650 million to defend against that attack.   I think DPOS is a way to spend less than $5 million for a superior defense system against that attack.

With regard to your bosses saying just let them change btc for cash - 
1. Then they will most likely pay with CC and you are back to 3% fees and security risks, and 
2. Its like saying Just accept Visa, and make mastercard customers go and pull cash out of an ATM and pay us in cash.  First rule of business... make it easy for customers to give you money. There are people out there with bitcoin with limited places to spend it.  Make it easy for them. Entrepreneurs job is to make it easy for the customer.
3. If you do exchange it into cash immediately (which I think you should do), then bitcoin is a just a payment network to them.   Great. Your tone suggest that has no value.  That is like saying paypal, visa and mastercard have no value.  Of course they do.

Thanks Penny,  Great points.
I dont think DPOS is perfect. Bitcoin is the undisputed leader of the pack and there is no point comparing DPOS to perfection but rather bitcoin.
I always think of the following: What happens if a nefarious force wanted to destroy the coin and had unlimited resources eg: govt's.  naked aggression. Putting guns to people's head. 
In POW - Bitcoin, I could put a gun to the head of the owners of 2 mining pools, but my actions would be short lived as the hashing power would quickly be point elsewhere.   SO I must take control of the actual hashing power.  Right now that seems impossible, but I think in a year or two you will find well over 50% of the hashing power in a handful of giant purpose built mining farms. That means I have to put a gun to say 20 peoples head simultaneously.
In the case of DPOS, I can put a gun to 51 delegates, but that will be short lived as the voting will strip the compromised delegate of their position. 51 Delegates &gt; than 2 mining pools
SO I my next alternative is to point the gun at 51% of stake holders.  I think as the exchanges and coinbases of the world pop up it is possible to see these custodians of peoples coins holding a lot of voting power.  But with all of the private coins held, this is only a maybe and there will still me a lot more than 20 exchanges/wallets/services.   
So on either front I have more decentralization and the costs of the attack are higher in DPOS than POW.  At least that is what I hang my hat on.

The point of distribution is an interesting one.
Security threat  Coin Distribution
It is worth noting that the first implementation of DPOS is BitSharesX and it has not positioned it self as a currency or payment system like Bitcoin. It is the world’s first profit producing Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC). Given this is its primary use it is perfectly fair that the creator be the 100% share holder. He need not give any of his company away and simply collect the profits himself.
But lets assume that in time, the creator does choose to sell or give away a small portion of his company. The market would have to factor into its price the centralization of power that stems from this. In this instance while still being a fair distribution of coins I think we can all agree that the market would be unwise to choose this DPOS chain as a general form of money because of its centralized nature.
If however a coin distribution method was used, that in the markets opinion created a high degree of decentralization, then it perhaps may be wise for the market to adopt this coin as a general everyday currency.  This would be similar to using your Apple stock to buy your groceries. If the technology allowed that to be frictionless, inexpensive and anonymous, then why not?
Having said that what bitshares did was very clever.  They crowd sourced development money for over 6 months.  coins were allocated in proportion to funds "donated" for development.  Even the original creators only got what they chipped in.
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:15:27
You cant just point a gun.  You need an army to take and defend the mining farm. (basically a government).  Of course this would destroy bitcoin and so the only people to profit is the banking/ government partnership.   The degree to which the mining is decentralized and the speed with which you could render the attack useless is the defense against such a hostile government of coalition of.

POS tends towards centralization at scale as well. It also fails to reduce costs to the degree of DPOS.  DPOS is at present only used by bitsharesx.

@_date: 2015-01-31 04:07:35
Perhaps I will make the next video on this?  But here is a quick explanation.
The easiest way to understand it is to consider the COMEX can have a wheat futures contracts without having any wheat on hand.  How do they do it?
Lets say I think the price of what will fall and I want to profit.  I can sell wheat today, and then buy it later for cheaper and I can profit by selling high and buying low. But how can I sell that which I don't have?  I can place $'s as collateral with the exchange.  If I sell a bushel of wheat at $200, the purchaser now has an IOU from me that says I owe him 1 bushel of wheat in the future. If the price goes up and I have to buy a bushell for $250, then that $50 loss I made is taken from my collateral.  Notice I both bought and sold wheat and yet there was no wheat... just $'s.  In this case, it is said that the settlement instrument was $'s.
So what if rather than have a wheat futures contract settled in $'s.  We had a dollar futures contract settled in cryptocurrency?
Instead of selling a bushel of wheat, I sell $1. I place cryptocurrency on an exchange as security for the buyer. Now in the future I owe the buyer $1 no matter the excahnge rate.  Either the rate moved up an I made a profit, or the
rate moved down and money was taken from my collateral and I made a loss.  Either way, the buyer receives $1 in the future no matter the exchange rate.
Therefore the buyers fully securitized IOU for $1 is always worth $1.  ie: it has a stable value.  And it is always backed by collateral (the cryptocurrency held on the blockchain.)  Hence the $1 IOU is fully securitized and has no counter party risk.
This is what bitshares has achieved.

As long as we have centralized solutions this kind of thing will continue to be a problem.   I think 2015 will be the year of the decentralized exchange.

Hi Eric,  I don't normally ask people to clarify their statements on reddit, but you are one of the smartest guys in crypto IMO.   I was curios what the important concept you were +1'ing was?   Is it that pegging is not possible?  I can think of hundreds of examples off the top of my head.  Or is there a deeper issue I am not getting? Are you saying it is an unworthy goal?
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:53:17
It is a valid thought.  Because the rate of inflation is predetermined, it can be argued that all inflation is built into the price.
But that does not solve the issue of expense. $650 million dollars is still spent on mining each year and it is being paid for by bitcoin holders because the price is not accelerating as fast it it would because that inflation is priced in.

Bitshares is not really an altcoin. It does not compete with bitcoin.  Its a business built on blockchain technology.   Imagine if OpenBazaar was built on a blockchain.  Think of it like that.  
What bitcoin is to money. 
OpenBazaar is to ebay. 
Bitshares is to exchanges.

These are all great questions.  I think we can safely say the market peg is working.  the other questions are quite interesting.

Although expect the the halving to be front run and the bull run to start about 9 months in advance.  So you only have to wait a little over a year.

That is correct.  Here is an explanation of how those tokens are created so you can decide for yourself to trust or not trust based on information and not rumor.

Hi Kyle,
That is not the reason bitshares has value. Bitshares has a clear business plan and is on course to be profitable.  ie: owning bitshares will pay you a dividend. If you invested in bitStamp you might expect a dividend one day and that is what bitshares believes it can deliver.   Like most startups it is choosing to run at a loss at present for rapid development and growth.

Sounds convenient but what are the spreads.  That is where the cost is.  If you buy bitcoin with Euro and then buy euro with bitcoin using the service how much do you lose (including any fees and spreads along the way?)

Valid point. Videos with no views can't do any good.   But it just goes to show how thin the skin is around here?   And by the way I do know this.   It was kind of a test to see just how much it had changed if at all.

Perhaps you could change the title and repost if you think the video is worth viewing.

Everything Stan said is correct. Also you should note that BTS is nowhere in the equation. In the video I showed the bts:bitUSD orderbook as it is the most active. There is a bitUSD:bitBTC order book which you would use for a bitcoin decentralized exchange.
The process looks like this for selling bitcoin for USD
1. Transfer btc &gt; bitBTC using one of many gateways. (this process takes minutes and you are exposed to counterparty risk during this time.)
2. Place order on the decentralized orderbook. There is no counter party risk before or after the trade is executed  and your order may sit on the exchange for long periods of time .
3. Transfer bitUSD &gt; USD using one of many gateways. (this process takes hours/days and you are exposed to counterparty risk during this time.)
The counter party risk you experience on steps 1 and 3 are the same as you experience at say Bitstamp.  However, for most people the vast majority of their time they are exposed occurs in step 2.  During step 2 on a decentralized exchange all counter party risk is removed. And perhaps equally importantly is because the huge carrot has been removed the number of hackers trying to hack gateways will be greatly reduced, making steps 1 and 3 significantly safer as well.

re: lastname. Fair point. That was a silly assumption of mine that he was referencing THE Gandhi. I apologize.
Not quite sure what you are intending with the quote. Are you suggesting intelligent people are never wrong? Or are you just pointing out my typo where I missed the "may".  If so, thanks. I have corrected it above.
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:15:49
I agree with mostly everything you said.  The gateway services can be decentralized with Mycelium and localbitcoins on small scales.  I think the regulation around gateway services is significantly less than exchanges. That means gateways should be abundant and simple.  I see it working like this.   Simply wire me USD with your account name in the subject and I will send you bitUSD minus a %spread.  From that moment on you are decentralized.  This solves the problem of people using mtgox as a wallet.  The exchanges no longer have wallets. Your blockchain wallet is the exchange.  It may not be perfect but it is a significant leap forward.  Also the benefit exists that all order books are centralized on a decentralized ledger.  That means tighter spreads and a more effecient eco-system.  thanks for the great questions.
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:18:44
no it would not, btu that is not what is happening here either.
A closer analogy would be, would the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) work if the settlement instrument was stock in the NYSE instead of USD's?
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:34:40
Do you have any productive criticisms? Intelligent people are trying to solve the very challenging problem of centralized exchanges. They may be wrong, they may be right. They may have a good idea or it might be bad, but what kind of tool just posts one line name calling nonsense. You are an embarrassment to yourself and bitcoin.  And that is definitely not what Gandhi would do.
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:44:43
That sucks dude. I am so sorry.  I had 1400 bitcoin stolen from my blockchain.info wallet back in the day.  Ironically, I also had a bunch on MTGox so I was not completely wiped out. Luckily those bitcoins were in cold storage by the time Gox went under, so I still have good supply of btc.  But these things are going to keep happening for as long we rely on centralized exchanges.  As I said in another post bitshares is 12 months ahead of any other solutions in the decentralized bitcoin exchange arena. Hopefully we get some more eyeballs on it and some of the amazing bitcoin developer talent will start contributing to the code and we will get the decentralized exchange we all want sooner.
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:18:40
Bitshares developers are solving these problems by building a decentralized exchange that can help solve a massive problem in the bitcoin world.  I can't code so I try to help out by educating my fellow bitcoiners where possible about the potential. But that is perfectly obvious so I assume you asked the question to avoid answering mine.   Do you have any productive criticisms of bitshares? If you do I would love to hear them. Maybe there is a gaping flaw in bitshares that I am not smart enough to see and you can save me from wasting my time?  Maybe you see something that can improve the bitshares decentralized exchange and then all bitcoiners will be more safe? But if you dont have any productive criticisms or you don't know much about bitshare then why would you post lame one line ad hominim attacks?  It makes no sense to me, but you obviously get something out of it or you would not do it?  So now you have me curios on that front too. If you don't have productive criticisms, then why do attack it?
@_date: 2015-10-16 05:40:36
HI, I am the guy in the video.
I am glad we agree on so much.  :)   On the issue we disagree on, it appears to me that it is possible for merchants to hold onto bitcoin only so far as they expect to be able to spend it in the near future... and even then they still have currency risk. This is where bitcoin gets into a terrible catch 22. 
Alternate currencies are accepted (on mass) only at locations where significant consumer demand is present for the alts. tourist destinations are a good example. That means consumers spending the bitcoin.  But if consumers intend to spend the bitcoin... Why bother going through the hassle and cost of converting fiat to bitcoin just to spend it? The only reason to go through that headache is to buy and hold for appreciation.  To add insult to injury they just lost the points they would have got if they would have used their CC.
I agree that quick growth, volatility and FOMO are now the primary reasons people get involved in bitcoin. Free samples from CPU mining are gone. Great PR for accepting bitcoins has largely gone.  I don't think the FOMO is a sustainable reason for bitcoin growth.  Your thoughts?   
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:51:49
The technology exists people. Lets band together as a community and never let this happen again.  2015. The year of the decentralized exchange.
@_date: 2015-02-16 11:35:04
So you hate memes as a form of advertisement? Bizarre, but whatever.  So why did you call me a bitshares shill, if you have no criticism or dislike for bitshares?  You would not call say Andreas Antonpolos a bitcoin shill. You would call him an advocate or an evangelist or some other respectful term. The fact that you called me a shill reveals that you have some dislike for bitshares. Yet I have asked twice and now a third time and you have been unable to come up with a single constructive criticism of bitshares? Do you know why you used such a disrepectful term like shill? Do you know why you don't like bitshares?
@_date: 2015-02-16 12:22:11
So you did not intend it to be offensive?  No problem.  Must be my over sensitivity combined with your lack of knowledge of the definition of the words you are using that caused the problem... Man life must be hard when it is that hard to say I was wrong. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:39:05
Bitshares is the only functioning decentralized exchange out there. I agree it is not perfect. But it is more than 12 months ahead of anything else. We would love some productive criticism, and help making it better.  I am confident a decentralized bitcoin exchange will be the dominant exchange in less than 24 months.   Perhaps bitshares improves in the ways that it needs to for that to happen, or perhaps some other idea steps up and is even better.  If that happens I will promote that option instead. I will sellout to the best most decentralized solution available.

I like the analysis and its an important part of the picture, but your comparison to previous technologies is way off.
There is an infinite number TV's, Radios, VCR's, Cell phones etc. The exponential nature will continue for longer this time around I think. Especially with regards to price even if not applicable to usage.
