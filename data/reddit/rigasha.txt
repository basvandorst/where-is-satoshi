It's amazing and exhausting that this needs to be repeated. Imagine if people actually read the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:47:28
I'd argue that it is blind optimism but then we'd just be disagreeing on the finer, less important points. If the LN is implemented in 6 months time I'll begrudgingly admit that my assumptions about its timing were wrong - I also do hope that it succeeds at being the cheap, fast, censorship resistant currency that Bitcoin once was.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:42:08
I watched the video, but it does reduce the number of transactions miners are involved with by design - therefore reducing quantity of fees they get (while, yes, increasing the cost per fee). You're also asking people to pay a 'LN tax' each pay cycle to place their Bitcoin for small to medium sized purchases.  
This doesn't feel like a revolution anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:30:02
Hahah that's very optimistic
RemindMe! 6 months "LN in 6 months"
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:47:35
The information is right there idk why you would bother lying about it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:16:20
Shhhh are you trying to get us all banned?!
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:59:47
And what exactly is a runway in this scenario
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:13:52
You made a post 2 months ago about how you're new to crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:31:50
I meant Verr and Co but wasn't very clear.
Seems like a way to cut miners out of the picture.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:58:03
Potentially, but it would be odd for someone who has been holding since 2013 asking how to store a crytpocurrency on Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:59:22
Edit: double post
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:40:06
Sure, and I definitely dont know the finer details of how the tech will work. However it does sound like I'll have to put coins onto the LN at the on-chain fee. If, for example, I get paid each month in fiat/BTC I will have to pay the fee and wait for that transaction to be included in order to use my coins as a reasonable form of currency for everyday transactions. I could be wrong, but that's the impression I get from researching the LN.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:51:28
Probably says more about me than it does about you that I approached this post with cynicism.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:12:48
It's like having a one lane highway and an eight lane highway.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:24:24
Sorry I should of been more clear about that. The tax I was referring to was putting your money into the LN each pay cycle and paying the on-chain fee to do so (as well as the cost when you close a channel). 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:02:02
But whats in it for them? Lower tx fees means lower income per transaction. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:30:52
are you trying to get us all killed?!
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:42:05
So like....adding a complex second layer to the system is a bad move?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:47:05
That jet still needs to take off and land on that  congested one lane highway - for a fee.
Fuck this analogy is great.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:50:02
It's what I call uncited tweets
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:51:01
The problem is that neither does BTC - hence the current situation 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:29:04
None of those announcements address fee pressure and delayed transactions directly...the bitgo announcement indirectly discusses it. You do have the understand the word 'directly' before you can use it though.
Forget the 18 months then, but seems like it would be good to have an idea of when the LN will be implemented.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:44:15
Every non-contentious hard fork of BTC has 'survived', it's just no not mined by anyone (because of the lack of value) and/or can't be mined by us mere peasents (due to the difficulty). 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:45:56
Actually the biggest question is why the value will be non-zero, or who will be meditating these transactions. There's legitimate concerns/critiques of BCH - this isn't one of them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:08:21
Shhh you're going to get us all killed
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:33:26
I'd rather have a band-aid while waiting for my life saving surgery then just staring at the gaping wound.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:36:41
I'm not going to be able to make an educated comment on Bulletproofs since I know nearly nothing about it.
The other three points are important (not LN per se, but second layer potential) however its just three tweets saying "hey we're still doing that thing we said we are doing and its going great." 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:57:19
Is this all part of the 18 month road map? Improvements to the network and client UIs are great, but what's the point if we're ignoring fundamental issues (fees, transaction times)
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:25:57
Well, yeah. Look at the cryptocurrentcy dominace that was lost over the last year because the figurative line was too long.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:52:37
You can't claim that high fees are no longer a problem AND "normal oscillations" are causing high fees - that's literally doublethink.
A currency thats vulnerable when too many people use/abuse it isnt a good currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:53:36
Right, people just started using and valuing altcoins more because bitcoin was just doing too well. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:42:24
Or even that spammers wanted community support for segwit but not 2x. I'm always tinfoiling.
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:41:05
But it should be able to be traded safely, cheaply and quickly....right?
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:44:48
Are you implying that tech advances linearly?
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:46:14
Genuinely curious on what you believe bitcoin is for now - digital gold, an uncensored currency for the upper middle class and beyond, or?
@_date: 2018-07-09 13:01:43
Dear FBI
Please stop the evil internet man who's claiming that one fork of a decentralized block chain shares the name (but has a different ticker) than the other fork of said decentralised block chain. I also think he is, like, stealing money somehow so you should probably investigate that. 
Thanks,
