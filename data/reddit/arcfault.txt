Small but important distinction:


Mod, not admin.  Admin is a term usually used to signify an employee of Reddit.com.

Thank you.  Pity was hoping the evidence/claims against him would be laid out in the plea bargain... but it wasn't.  I'm curious the extent that he went to that earned him 11 years.. a pretty hefty sentence.
@_date: 2015-08-30 10:18:21
Or you know, perhaps they were complying with a valid Court Order?
Just a thought.
@_date: 2015-08-30 10:14:56
Correct, but say, for example,  a person contacted their nearest ISIS representative directly and layed out a complete plan for an anonymous donation system complete with all technical details, a plan of action, a timeline, and a budget (bitcoin seems incidental here)...
That might be construed as illegal under current US law.

You know, I don't want facts to get in the way of a good ol' (and probably somewhat valid) conspiracy theory... 
but he did a bit more than tweet some unpopular ideas...
@_date: 2015-08-30 05:47:33
@_date: 2015-08-30 05:49:59
you know, and a few other things....
@_date: 2015-08-30 05:42:15
That is interesting.
Obviously, ianal, but based on the terrible article in the OP, I was concerned that the teen was being sandbagged for exercising 'unpopular' free speech on Social Media, however if the Statement of Facts is accurate this is clearly not the case and he appears to have indeed provided direct assistance/aid/ etc as described in [18 U.S. Code § 2339B](  I'd be curious as to the reasoning the Judge used to arrive at the 11 year figure - I can't decide if he was made an example of or if the punishment fits.
@_date: 2015-08-30 05:30:24
He did way more than that.  Here's the Statement of Facts from the Court Proceeding courtesy of The article is shit.  Everyone should read the source I linked and arrive at your own conclusions but it appears he did a lot more than what the article portrays.
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:30:04
How exactly does one access that document through that site?  The court docs seem to be behind a login prompt.  Is it not public record?  Can someone rehost the documents?

More evidence that r/bitcoin and Reddit in general is largely a place where people vote for their biases regardless of accuracy
@_date: 2015-08-30 05:46:46
Would you consider editing your comment and including this link at the bottom: 
Its the Statement of Facts from the Court Proceedings - it appears he a did a lot more than just promote extremeists on Social Media and the article is dogshit.

Why did it take 10-15m out of curiosity?  It's on the lan and there's no way the ROM is that large, so I assume it has something to do with the write speed/processing power of the STB?
@_date: 2015-09-03 09:43:03
The sub voted that idiotic post to the top entirely on the premise of "omg conspiracy against bitcoin" without bothering to check any facts.  
 There were a dozen comments in that post directly refuting that wildly flimsy statement from the mailing list informing OP that he was wrong - complete with instructions on how to configure the ATT 'Gateway' device.  Edit: Nor did any of the Mods flair the post.
Pretty good lesson imo to anyone that's under the impression that  is some sort of intellectual oasis any better than the rest of Reddit.  Maybe it used to be before it has 172k subs but not anymore.  Regression to the mean.  
So as usual, if you care about accurate information, don't believe the shit you read around here until you've verified it for yourself.
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:19:37
Yea I don't think OP knows you can config the firewall on the gateway.
On a related note, ethernet over those set-top boxes was terrible - if someone was running HD streams in the house the packet loss and latency was dramatic.  Acceptable for web-browsing for sure, but not anything beyond that lol.  Also, for unknown reasons, if you reset a STB's it would take a literal 10m-15m to redownload/reload/bootup to a functional state.
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:18:59


Good idea, from now on we should promote and widely disseminate wildly inaccurate information first before doing some basic fact checking on our own* especially when we can come up with a sensationalist title that fits nicely into a preferred narrative!  
Which leads to things like [this comment.](
\* In this case, that consisted of the arduous task of checking the comments.  I think you are kidding yourself if you think people who voted that up even bothered to open them.
EDIT: [ **WE DID IT REDDIT!**](
@_date: 2015-09-02 13:43:39


Ahh, there it is.  Neat!  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:10:33
I am 90% sure you're wrong here OP:
Are you sure you're not talking about a "Gateway" - (Router/Modem Combo) that services like  Uverse use?  If so, you are aware you can log into the gateway with the info stickered to the side of it where you can adjust the firewall's settings, and everything else, or just disable the entire routing part of the device?

From their FAQ:




The plot thickens.

You're comparing communities with gigantic differences in populations - one has 180k subscribers, the other 20k subscribers.
I think you had already formed your "conclusion" prior to this, IMO.
@_date: 2016-07-21 21:57:15
I'm listening.  Go on...

Just because the currency is "unregulated" does not mean you forfeit the ability to sue someone for defrauding you no matter which method you chose to exchange value for goods/services.
