Just a wild prediction: btc will get a major correction
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:03:14
I dont understand. Isnt this lightning network make bitcoin less bitcoin?  Offchain solution on a blockchain??  To me this seems like a fake blockchain. Pls explain if you think i am wrong
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:42:43
Just a wild prediction: major correction starts in 6 hours. Have a great trading day to all.

@_date: 2018-08-29 21:17:49

I think smart people will go for pos coins today to see profit in the future. Pow coins are just outdated in my opinion
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:58:29
No are you? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:56:38
If you are not a pump and dumper dont worry. They will release your funds eventuLly.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:22:53
Fuck bitcoin cash I am talking about all mining coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:26:52
Yes there is check Cardano
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:28:11
Can anyone pls explain me why in the world we would want to use  minning coins in the future instead of staking coins? I dont see future in minning coins. We know that a singel bitcoin transaction takes as much power as 7 households per day. This is the biggest scalibility problem not transaction fee or what so ever.

Really I dont know what will happen. But something tells being in btc is getting dangerous...
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:27:57
Be honest did you do alot of pump and dumps? If yes, there you go why it is under review...
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:27:32
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:08:56
Do you think? I see more and more people backing bch. Like
McFee and one of the original
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:30:37
Thing is if the big guys who hold btc from early years desode to move to bch it will collapse
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:29:35
Then maybe they suspect you of pump and dumping. And are looking up tour trade history. I really hope you did not do pump and dumps. Because if they find out you are in trouble. Pump and dump is basicly stealing money...

@_date: 2018-02-01 19:40:01
I will buy if everyone panic sells
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:05:13
This may be the main reason behind the selloff
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:25:05
Bottom is getting formed. Time to buy ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:18:11
First we need to flush money that wants to play us. Dont worry we will be back to the top. If you dont believe I really have no time to convince you
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:03:58
Do you guys think we may crash hard ?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:20:00
Woow mate. Its amazing. I bet it would be worth $$mil some day
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:41:09
5600 is like a wet dream ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:42:02
When you sell at 20.000 and buy at 5600 ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:25:42
But it does. It shows how much power these banks have over us. It is up to us guys. We dont need banks anymore. Platforms like Cardano can easy replace banks in the near future. Take back the power to the people. And change the world!
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:21:09
I am a bull and I will ram these skinny bears for you. All in!

Mark my words. The first country that will fully support cryptos will be gain huge tech advantages in the future!

 Bitcoin was pioneer not the next big thing. The next big thing is probably Cardano
