Credit Unions are typically run by a local board and members (i.e. account holders) are able to be elected to it by other members who attend the annual meeting of the credit union.  (Not all credit unions are the same, but in general this is true)  As a member of the credit union, you can complain to one of your board members if something like this were to happen to you, and they should be much more accessible than, say, a Chase Bank board member.
They might take the same action, but it would be a policy by their member board.  If you are worried your credit union would do that, consider running for the board to help ensure it won't happen.  Or at least attend the annual meeting and make your opinion known so the board knows how to vote in the future on these issues around cryptocurrency.

I think people who are interested in crypto should try to get on the boards before they make policies like that.  Hopefully if we get involved we can help influence those policies to favor crypto instead of fearing it.

Still counts.  Good god man, you live in Wyoming.  Take credit where you can. :)

Wyoming was the first state to give women the right to vote.  They've got a history of setting a national precedence :)

Buy the Trezor, get it setup and then go to 
You can arrange with somebody to buy Bitcoins from them for cash.
