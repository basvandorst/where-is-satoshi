As of today is Coinbase a safer option than Electrum for splitting ? I was planning on moving everything to Electrum but haven't done so yet, but now that Coinbase will do it for users why risk anything?

Are others dips possible soon?

As of today the main limit of bitcoin is security and the community has to figure it out before people trust it for real. What this sub does not seem to understand is that people are not easily willing to hide their money in paper wallet in their house or rent a safe deposit box. Things will start happening, like a fire or a flood or simply someone passing away and not leaving his keys to his kids, and huge amounts of wealth will be lost forever.
This sub is full of people who look very tech savvy and rich, willing to go the extra mile for this dream. But average people work hard for a few k a month and probably value money differently than early adopters who had 100x gains or bull runs that made them earn 10k in a day.
I think hacking and the risk of losing everything without recuperating it might be the real issue here. Look at that post from the guy who happened to find 8400 btc after only 6 years. People were suggesting that the guy would be hunted down by criminals and tortured. That is just something nobody is willing to deal with, like nobody is willing to lose their annual salary or store it on hardware or paper that can always be lost. Figure out security and fund protection, even partially at the cost of anonimity and decentralization, and it may become a currency. This is way more important than fees and usability which tech will solve.

I'm going to move my btc from coinbase to electrum in the next couple of days. This will be my first movement outside of coinbase and I've read a little bit on how to do it and split coins after the seg2 fork.
Any specific precautions I should take? Should I move them a little at a time? Also what is the deal with the bitcoin gold fork? After splitting the coins, where do you recommend sending the fake btc to dump as soon as possible? Also, my electrum wallet is on an online mac, what are the chances of getting hacked on mac and losing it all? Is there a specific antimalware you would suggest for macs and cryptos?
There is alot of info out there but most people here seem to have it figured out already.

This will drive everyone crazy... Bought at 1.8 in july and at 2.7 a little after, bought some more at 4.5 convinced it would keep going up. Sold some at 3.7 during the crash and woke up at 7 30 instead of 6 30 otherwise I would have bought back at 3.
Still up a few k in a few months but it could have been 5 if I had played my cards better. All a learning experience, especially knowing that it will most likely go back down do 3k soonish

Who's going to buy BTC1 if everyone will dump it right away?

True and I think a great solution to the current 5k wall would be starting to speak in terms of smaller units. People would get it more and would be more willing to buy. I'm talking about regular people not crypto experts or even just reddit users.

I think 5k will be a psychological barrier for a while. Who on this sub would ever by at 5k, and if so why aren't they buying already as much as they can and converting all fiat right now? The price has grown so much but it comes to a point when people are going to feel like it's late or just to risky for this speculative game, which is the reason 90% of early or current adopters are in right now.

Why are people not supposed to use SPVs during the fork? 
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:08:22
I panic sold at 3.7 after big gains in two months.now kinda waiting for another dip to rebuy as much as I can afford

What's bitcoin gold going to be worth right after the fork and is it going to be easy to split on electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:58:18
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:06:49
Yeah might be similar to what people said before, but personally I found 2 and 3k affordable seeing how much it kept goin up, 5k way less given that as soon as it hit that number it tanked.

I have some btc on coinbase but was planning to move them to Electrum for the split. Would you advise against that?
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:16:56
Sorry but I'm writing on my phone during lunch break lol
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:32:36
What exactly is the risk of keeping btc on coinbase when the hf takes place? Also where would you recommend moving them for someone with little knowledge of wallets?
