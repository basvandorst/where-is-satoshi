Bitcoin isn't like a stock. Maybe you could compare it to buying penny stocks from a risk perspective, but buying a fraction of a BTC is more like buying 1/16th of an oz. Of gold or something similar. 
It might be easier to wrap your head around when you realize 1 BTC is just a denomination. E.g. 1 BTC is 100,000,000 Satoshis the same way one dollar is 100 cents.

Not sure if it will work on Shopify but I've played around with [Mycelium Gear]( before and it seemed pretty neat. No need for a middle-man

Yep, you can even set up recurring buys through coinbase. (E.g. $50 every 2 weeks)

Pretty sure there are other withdrawal methods, cheque/draft is just the free option.

Canada has had chip cards for years and bitcoin is going strong up here. I'm honestly surprised its taken the US this long to implement it.

Where are you seeing that? Bitinfo says it's around 170gb..

Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if a large part of the blame lies with Worldpay. They are a nightmare to deal with.

IF they managed to do that I'm not quite sure bitcoin would be that much safer. Paper wallets, maybe. But the integrity of online exchanges and wallets would likely be compromised as well, no?

Unless it drops below $100 per coin I feel like mBTC is still a perfectly reasonable naming scheme.

Just checked it out and apparently HuoBi does direct bank transfers? If thats the case I dont think it will last long. From what I have heard banks tend to crack down on that as soon as volume picks up, at least I think that was the case in Canada with VoS and CaVirtEx, maybe china is different though

You tried Vault of Satoshi? Lower fees for trading. Doesn't have much volume though..
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:03:33
Wow that's some impressive volume, my interest is definitely piqued now.

"in some Chinese way that we don't know yet" 
At this point I doubt the Chinese even know what is going on. What are the volume differences like between these exchanges? That could potentially explain a lot.
