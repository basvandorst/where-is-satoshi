So are you ever going to release how this happened in the first place ? What is the point of using BitGo when they seemingly did nothing for this to happen

fear mongering? 3/4 of this sub is fear mongering because everyone says the price of BTC will just go up but not actually comment on the fact that this is all speculation. And then posts the most realistic comment that I have seen in weeks and that is fear mongering lol

I️ have been waiting 2 weeks now to get my account verified. Apparently they couldn’t find public records of me, they also don’t let you change your address on your profile. Like I️ used my actual current address but I️ assume whatever system they are using still probably has my old address. And then I had to take like 10 different passport photos and it still didn’t work as it wouldn’t recognize the picture. No flare, even scanned my passport and the upload system said it was too much glare. 
I️ moved to binance with no issues.

@_date: 2014-02-25 17:42:18
So who exactly are the thieves ?
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:57:24
Yeah I used electrum and I like it so far, it seems a lot simpler than most other wallets out there. I like the seed password process, where when reading and researching about other types of wallets, this way just seemed a lot easier. Security is very important, but having everything right there instead of having to worry about outside factors is nice to know.
The only thing I have issues with so far is buying bitcoins from an exchange. I live in Canada have only looked at QuickBT so far because it just requires your wallet address and can use Interac debit through my bank which makes it seem really easy in my eyes. But the thing is you can only buy small amounts of bitcoins, but I can't find out how often I can buy them is though. Thanks for the post and info though! I will give you a tip once I get some bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-12 12:23:58
Here is a hypothetical question, what if Bitstamp is in as bas as a situation that Mt.gox is in? Everyone is acting like they are handling the situation like they should be, which is true, but what if they are just trying to mask what is going on behind the Mt.gox problems?
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:10:49
I didn't have my deposit go through until this morning on VoS, just after the price went up ~$100. Just my luck!
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:06:05
So if MtGox is insolvent, what does this mean for the future of bitcoin and its price?
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:51:48
Thank you for the response! I really appreciate the write up and it is starting to make a lot more sense to me. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:39:08
I said this in an other thread a while ago, it was almost too good of a coincidence that BTC-e started seeing trouble right when Mtgox started to come into trouble.
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:37:20
I find tipping annoying, and a really cheesy gimmick, just like dogecoin in itself. I don't want your 5 cent tip. The tipping "culture on reddit" kinda reminds me of when Facebook first came out with "poke". Yeah it was cool to poke someone at first, but after a few days no one really cared.
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:06:06
So I have a wallet through Electrum, I am getting an account through the Vault of Satoshi and say I will buy 1 BTC.
How do I get that bitcoin into my own wallet? What exactly is withdrawing from the exchange? I am just getting confused from having it be in my wallet / on the exchange / withdrawing it, if that makes any sense. Thanks.

So who has these 750,000 bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:10:42
I basically want to put them in cold storage as a long term investment, I just want to buy about $500-1000 in bitcoin and leave them in my wallet for next few years.
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:21:09
Am I the only one who finds dogecoin to be incredibly annoying? I am a more than a supporter of crypto-currency and the future of technology, but just everything that I have seen and looked at regarding dogecoin just comes across as annoying to me. The whole tipping a couple of cents all the time thing, talking in dog meme all the time, the annoying to look at sub-reddit, I just find everything about dogecoin annoying, and I am trying to like it. Is that reasonable to think?

Where exactly?
@_date: 2014-03-17 08:00:34
Probably 2 years ago, I heard about SilkRoad and started researching that. I basically wanted to buy some drugs off SR and started researching how to do that, which is where I came across bitcoin. At the time everything seemed way too over my head and confusing so I kinda just ignored bitcoin and SR for a while. Fast forward to now and I wish I bought some bitcoin years ago!
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:21:22

I don't think you fully understand what actually happened...
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:17:24
Thanks for the response, it makes sense. I was never worried that this will hurt bitcoin in the long run because I feel that is just a minor bump in the road. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:56:07
People talk about security being their number  priority when it comes to bitcoin, yet they go and download cryptocurrency related addons and extensions. Like really? Regardless of if you think you can trust the developer of this, it just seems like a bad idea from the beginning. If you want to always know what the price of your coin is, just leave an exchange open in a tab. It sucks that they were stolen, but you had 60 BTC in an exchange and you list it due to an unfortunate situation. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:52:51
Can someone give me a well written ELI5 on why someone should be interested in bitcoin? Why they should purchase it, why they should use it and why they it is important for our future? I want something that I can give to my friends and the FAQ and Common Myths didn't quite have what I wanted.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:10:11
Good to see that they really do care, when I read your story the other day it just seemed like the system made a mistake.

@_date: 2014-04-28 07:12:41
People are lazy/not as smart as they think they are. Like look at the guy that lost 500 BTC the other day because he left it all on his exchange, had one of these coin tracker extensions installed, tried to take out his BTC and they ended up getting stolen. I really think its people acting like they are a lot smarter than they actually are, because if people actually care so much about security, you would never, ever install a fucking BTC related extension.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:17:47
Is that because Mtgox is such a large exchange with a lot of bitcoins? I actually was going to buy bitcoins tonight for the first time as I just got my first wallet. Guess I should wait a bit then.
