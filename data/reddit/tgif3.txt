So if I just wanted to run another full node can I grab one. I got 5 vps's right now that I pay for all in bitcoin which are full nodes from greencloudvps.com I figure its awesome to run a full node and pay for it in bitcoin.

Ask mtgox to pay my legal fees for not keeping good records that we were not able to export when mtgox was a functional site? I want to say it was probably a few $100 but a few hundred bucks in btc back then is pretty good now.

Sadly my balance was zero but I had a withdraw to Liberty Reserve being processed by mtgox that they never sent. Sadly it shows my balance as zero though. Liberty Reserve got shut down by the feds later too so even if mtgox says they sent the money back then I have no record of it.

@_date: 2015-10-15 15:16:46
Call their phone number and tell them it's in their list. Record and post for all the bitcoin whores in this subreddit.
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:02:29
Who are you to say what I can afford haha. If i gave my bitcoin talk username and you looked when I got involved you'd speak differently lol. A lot of them don't have prices listed.
@_date: 2015-10-16 12:02:30
I try go get out as much as possible. At least I'm not a meth fueled meth head.
How did you recognize me so quickly lol.
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:54:12
They normally aim the cameras high enough so it makes sense.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:55:15
Fucking lier it says 5 days.
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:15:18
You should still ask it.
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:30:21
Same your golden. Even if you buy now and hold. I have coins I have held since they were 3$ a piece and 1$ after the 30$ bubble crashed. Granted I do still buy and sell but these are so pretty to hang on to. Just like silver and gold bars but more rare.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:55:23

That's a really shitty rep.
@_date: 2015-10-16 13:53:05
DarknetMarkets = dnm = buy whatever illegal substance you want with bitcoin and get it delivered in the mail. I frequent there often and he recognized my name posting in another sub which is not often.
