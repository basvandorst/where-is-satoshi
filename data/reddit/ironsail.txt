I believe zerocoin should be implemented in its own separate protocol and people could trade back and forth between them should the need arise.
The day bitcoin implements anonymity is the day governments actually try to shut it down, and they will be somewhat successful with that. We can punk them though, if we keep bitcoin legitimate (i.e. they have a hope of controlling it) it can be our gateway to the more freedom-fighting financial systems.

Something should be done to prevent things like this. Huge transaction fees should be not be allowed.
An example idea: blocks where the largest transaction fee is greater than the combined transaction fees of the 2nd to 20th largest should not be valid.

Bitcoin is money. Websites do not give away money for free.
I might though. Send me your address, I will send you ~$5.

No, stop this line of thinking at one.
Cash is the best way to keep other's noses out of your business.
You know what the government really wants to do is discontinue cash and migrate currency onto debit-card/national-photo-IDs like they are in Nigeria [1] so they can get full records of every purchase you have ever made whenever they want.
I am going to fight for cash until the end.
Bitcoin for internet.
Cash for real life.
That is my policy.
