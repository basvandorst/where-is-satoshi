That's a big no from me fam.

It's sincere man. I'm kinda throwing myself into the world of stocks with small amounts of money to see how I do but I'm being stupid and starting with crypto. Could you elaborate more on what you're saying?
@_date: 2019-04-27 01:00:50
Dude I really appreciate the tips. I've been reading non stop for the past week and I hope to learn a lot more throughout my years. I know day trading is risky as fuck and only like 5% are successful so I'm def not going to take that route. Thanks again for your comment. I wish you and me luck :)

That must've been an awesome experience tbh. Did you get a decent cash out with that investment?
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:12:05
Just did. Didn't feel anything abnormal.
@_date: 2019-04-27 13:49:34
Got the goosebumps from that. Well done man. That's a hell of a win at only 18. I'll be there pretty soon myself

Remember guys. Money laundering is not a crime.

As soon as it hit 8k it dropped to 7,700k then jumped back to 8,057k, then dropped again back to like 7,500, then jumped back up to like 8,200 all in under 2 min. Now it's rising fast asf.

Yeah I know. It's kinda is starting to get annoying that people just rush to Reddit for answers when they can get their answer in less than .2 seconds.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:01:17
You seem like the type of guy to pray to Satoshi every night.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:13:01
Holy shit were actually gonna hit 8k today lol
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:18:20
Please don't remind me of those ads. Make me wanna blow my head off.
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:49:35
Well....this definitely isn't a beggars post.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:39:44
Holy shit dude bitcoins about to pop off. Like big time. Wait until Reddit and all the other social media catch on to this bull run. I wouldn't doubt that mas usage would be driving up the price based off the last run.
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:22:56
The internet told me you're stupid ASF.
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:02:41
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:06:02
It's gonna be up more than 5x this bull run. Hold on to your seats my friend.

No. Your submission has been flagged for removal.

Sorry man. Just seemed like u were the owner of the site and we're advertising it. Plus one for you though for supporting Bitcoin. Good luck on this bull run and stay safe!
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:50:43
Just download Robinhood and buy straight away
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:42:11
Hope you bought in ��
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:28:02
LMFAO. Right there with ya. Wish I actually knew what was driving it up.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:50:54
Can you reverse the push up if it goes down?
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:00:52
Yeet bruv
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:39:39
Had a feeling it was a bunch of people cashing out. The crash today gave Bitcoin a lot of attention so that good also ��
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:15:06
It's a crime bro.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:11:44
You always remove my posts.
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:37:58
It's going to disappear
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:56:41
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:20:59
We should start telling people that it's going to crash when they ask. But they'll just go off and make a new post asking why it's going to fall. Bitception.
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:03:43
I'm gonna go shoot myself now.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:38:26
Imagine if we hit 8k today.
