I agree and if anything the Government will embrace and end up making money off bitcoin and try to prevent other altcoins from reaching the same level.

Craig's got the ATO on his back though. Why would he prove he is Satoshi? So he can lose all his money to tax? So he can be kidnapped and tortured to give up his keys? Why exactly? If I was Satoshi I sure as shit wouldn't be proving it either.

Do you think it might be smart to buy BCH once it looks like BTC starts to drop? I think your theory is right.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:43:31
So where do you suggest someone invests to make money out of this?
