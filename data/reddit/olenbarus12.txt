How many of the forbes top 400 comes from a low-middle class background? 
Are you temporarily embarrassed?
You may not realise it, but you could be a temporarily embarrassed millionaire. Do you plan to someday in the future have more money? Are you concerned that your taxes are too high, because someday you might pay too much tax. Do you ride the bus only because this year you can’t afford that luxury car you’re going to have? Do you live pay cheque to pay cheque like most people just because you haven’t had your lucky break.
You aren’t rich and it’s very unlikely you ever will be. The economic and power systems of this planet are not designed for you to get rich. The American dream doesn’t exist and it never did. Stop being a temporarily embarrassed millionaire and just be a person.

When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with "quantitative easing" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.

We use fiat to measure value... but we will end up using btc to measure value.. so.. the more value btc has the more stuff you can get/do

Inflation is theft because its produced by the banking cartels unregulated overproduction and unequal distribution of new money.....
Thats why Bitcoin is incredible, nobody can manipulate it, we can all agree on how it works and build our world with it as an inmutable base....

Bitcoin (rated C+) gets excellent scores for security and widespread adoption. But it is encountering major network bottlenecks, causing delays and high transactions costs. Despite intense ongoing efforts that are achieving some initial success, Bitcoin has no immediate mechanism for promptly upgrading its software code.
Steem (B-) enjoys a relatively good balance of moderate strength in nearly all the key factors considered along with a social network feature.
Ethereum (B), the second most widely adopted cryptocurrency, benefits from more readily upgradable technology and better speed, despite some bottlenecks.

The boom and bust cycle is a key characteristic of today's capitalist economies..
Since the mid-1940s, the United States has experienced 12 boom-bust cycles...
During a boom, the central bank makes it easier to obtain credit by lending money at low interest rates. Individuals and businesses can then borrow money easily and cheaply and invest it in, say, technology stocks or houses. Many people earn high returns on their investments, and the economy grows.
 
The problem is that when credit is too easy to obtain and interest rates are too low, people will overinvest. This excess investment is called “malinvestment”. There won’t be enough demand for, say, all the homes that have been built, and the bust cycle will set in. Things that have been overinvested in will decline in value. Investors lose money, consumers cut spending and companies cut jobs. Credit becomes more difficult to obtain as boom-time borrowers become unable to make their loan payments. The bust periods are referred to as recessions; if the recession is particularly severe, it is called a depression.
Im sure you have watched Ray Dalio "How the economic machine works"
We are at the point where wealth redistribution must be done, but of course the billionaire/royal class doesnt want to. Theres a reason the French Revolution happened... Thankfully now we have technology to help us do that redistribution----&gt; Enter Bitcoin

1) The government creates glorified IOU's called BONDS
2)These BONDS increase our national debt and put the public on the hook to pay it back...These IOU"s are swapped to create currency, the Treasury sell the Bonds to the banks, the banks sell our IOU's to the Federal Reserve Bank (which is another bank which they probably own, an not a part of the government) at a profit ...The federal reserve then opens it's checkbook which doesn't have a penny in it and buys those IOU's with IOU's it writes, check on a checking account that has a ZERO balance...then they give those checks to the banks and currency just springs into existence and the the who process repeats...this results in a build up of bonds at the federal reserve and currency at the treasury which is really just a supply of numbers...the treasury just deposits this supply of numbers in the various branches of government...

Holding Bitcoin makes the price rise which attracts more miners which makes the network more secure... we are not digging a hole in the ground like with gold...
Inflation is theft. It doesnt work and we might as well try the sound money approach..

After lots of suffering I managed to do it. Very unfortunately mycelium does not even support importing their old keys.
Fortunately they provide a backuputil which converts the private key in their format into WIF (Wallet Import Format): 
I takes some effort to built this tool but afterwards you obtain the private key in WIF format. This in turn can be entered in the new Mycelium on iOS.
Again, very unfortunately, the key is NOT imported but rather the funds transfered to the Mycelium account. This results again in unnecessary transfer fees.
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:33:14

1. It doesnt matter, what Im saying is that valubale resources are usually discovered and hoarded by a few, then they get distributed as they are traded.
2. Its was unsustainable due to the fact that is hard to settle big transactions in gold. We needed something faster. Sadly in the quest for speed we were chained to debt.
3. Currently 5 people have more wealth than 3billion.... Sadly the guillotine is not an option. The only way to take their power away is to stop using debt money. 
4. Bitcoin will be more desirable as the tech advances. Having an inmutable unit of account is priceless. Thats not why gold is valuable... 
5. You think that because I can open and e-commerce store Im on the same level as Amazon? Lol


Most americans dont even have $1000 saved... The rest of the world is in a even worse situation..  I doubt it matters.

Except the 6% dividend to private banks
The federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors. The federal government receives all the system's annual profits, after a statutory dividend of 6% on member banks' capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.[23]

When times are tough, the two entities help to formulate and put in place economic policies designed to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates and making more money available to banks and consumers. (Read more in The Federal Reserve's Fight Against Recession.)
When a decision is made to issue tax rebates, the Department of the Treasury is responsible for taking money out of the Federal Reserve and putting it into the hands of consumers. Consumers, in turn, spend the money. Through their spending, they funnel money into the economy, resulting in increased sales of consumer goods and increased employment to create those goods.

Bitcoin is a baby market... Voltility is to be expected 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:19:42
Why haven’t they killed torrents then....?
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:11:34
Lol have you ever bought gold? How do you know if its not fake? Can you run the tests to verify it yourself?? You would get scammed a lot
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:55:21
Its a baby market. Volatility is to be expected in the beggining. As the market matures we will see less and less of the wild swings.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:14:46
Uh whats his central point then
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:22:49
I guess we will find out
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:55:37
Also many "traders" are using their entire stack to trade which is basically gambling. Trades should be less than 1% of what you have

Both sides are made of puppets whose end goal is to increase corporate profits. You can see it by looking at how much wealthier and bigger corporations are getting.

Yeah you cant because decorative lights is useless and bitcoin mining isnt

The average chinnese now earns more than the average american lol

So their valuation is based on faith? Tesla has 0 profit.
Couldnt Bitcoin valuation be based on it replacing the gold market for example? Or maybe 10% of it...?

They cant... theres already too much money involved... greed is what will kill capitalism ...

@_date: 2018-03-11 18:23:08
That would just open a black market.... it would make bitcoin thrive even more. If they can’t ban drugs/alcohol/weapons how can you think they can successfully ban bitcoin? It would be pointless....

Do people sound crazy when they say inflation is theft?

Well currently 5 people have more wealth than 3 billion... We are already at the extreme 
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:13:34
Get out of here troll
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:14:59
Yeah not everyone can do that. The current system ensures that just a few can rise up through the cracks. This is why many of us believe Bitcoin can be a good change on the world. The only way for more people to win is to stop playing the rigged game and start a new one, one in which everyone has to play by the rules

Their crypto division is the interesting part of Overstock (Medici Ventures)

The problem with inflation is the way its created... Which is the whole fking point
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:58:08

The way you beat stronger players is not by becoming stronger but by being smarter
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:05:18
Whats the point of good news? It only makes the price go up, therefore you can buy less BTC. This is why none of the whales like promoting BTC
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:02:28
Or maybe you should study the history of how our financial system got to this point. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:16:39
Yes you can and many people do. You just have to be positioned in the right circles

Keep in mind that the USD has lost 95% of its value and it keeps going down.... 
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:10:31
Im saying that even the biggest and most revolutionary companies do lose 50% of their value many times... Bitcoin doesnt lose 50% every week but ok..
Bitcoin is volatile because its a baby market..... And it will remain volatile until institutions come in... And they will,  theres a reason everyones been building bridges for them to come
If you are not smart enough to see how revolutionary Bitcoin is, then feel free to miss out
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:15:42
That's irrelevant. Hollywood Stock Exchange was an exchange and wasn't subject to KYC/AML. The fact that people exchange data and show a price does not mean its a financial activity; it is publishing, nothing more.

You hit the jackpot. Nobody knows who owns what. Stocks didnt have a smooth conversion from paper to computers.... thats the reason naked short selling has been used to much...
It was also one of the causes of the 2008 crash. Many people own the same stock, as long as they dont take it out or switch it to another brokerage. Thats why it takes weeks to switch from brokers.
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:25:47
Yeah and the Big Four also audited Carillion and said everything was fine. Lol
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:23:20
Well a couple banka got fined for doing exactly that

So then its not eating that much energy
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:32:53
As longs as theres no institutional money bitcoin price will go down after a FOMO run, this is because theres nobody left to trade it constantly every day like in the stock market

Although an instrument of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms."

They cant even agree in noncontroversial stuff. The probability of most of the major countries banning BTC is extremely low. I find it more likely that countries nationalize exchanges and steal all the BTC

Ok grandpa. Bonds hahaha have you seend the current state of the bond market?
I agree with blue chips, but Im still confident that at least 1% will go to crypto and thats still a shitton of money. Remember the market is incredible small. Dont believe the media saying that everyone is already in BTC...

A part comes from taxes but a big part comes from DEBT. Why the fuck do you think US debt keeps growing... Currently 21trillion...


The Bureau of the Fiscal Service manages the Government’s debt. That means it keeps records, takes care of selling the debt, and handles paying back people who loaned the Government money.
The U.S. Treasury and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service do not decide how the money is spent. The legislative branch of Government (Congress) decides how the money is spent.
There is a maximum amount of debt the Government can have. This is known as the “debt ceiling.” To raise that amount, the U.S. Treasury must get Congress to approve a new and higher limit.


. 
Why do you think prices rise? Its because the dollar loses value as more of it gets injected into the economy. As long as there is growth everything fine. But when things start to slow down.....

@_date: 2018-02-27 11:25:35

Why would I buy at 13k if I can buy at 7k on an exchange?
Im pretty confident. Theres a reason most countries integrated BTC fairly fast into their financial system. Would you do that if you expected it to die off? I really doubt it.

Fortunes are made by concentrated investments, no risk no gain, when you are young its better to make concentrated investments since you can recover for it, as you grow older you switch to low risk

Yep, the government prefers that you lose your money slowly, if you lost it all at once people would start to revolt...
At the end of the day the effect this regulation has is that it keeps concentrating the wealth, idgaf about intentions, I care about what regulation actually does.
If I put a rule to protect people but the result is that the rich get to accumulate wealth, then it puts huge doubt on the actual justification for the rule...

Necessary is a strong word. The problem with inflation is that its a very powerful tool onn the wrong hands especially if ita managed by a corrupt entity..
Although an instrument of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms."
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:06:08
You do know Bitcoin mining will end right? After that mining will just be used to secure the network there wont be a lot of incentive to keep increasing the hash rate. We also could have regulations you know?

If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered....

Edit: central bank corruption is nothing new, in fact Andrew Jackson had to fight  in the Bank Wars to destroy the bank....
Dont you find it odd that we keep increasing the debt ceiling without any way to pay for it!? We are enslaving the future citizens so we can pay today for retarded wars...
Theres also a reason the other super powers have been hoarding a lot of gold. As the debt increases it becomes less likely that the US can fulfill all of its obligations, in fact it cant anymore and thats why many social programs are being cut....

The funny thing is that many of those that own crypto are very aware of this. I mean, crypto basically forces you to swallow a big fat red pill. 
Its just a matter of time before more people realize this. 
Especially when the poor/rich countries start to have:
* Crazy populists movements (US, UK, Italy+) 
* Banks runs (Latvia), 
* Confiscation of wealth (South Africa),
*  Big government contractors getting bailed (UK, China), 
* Corrupt politicians escaping after stealing billions (Mexico)+

Remember Bitcoin supply is completely predictable. If the economy adjusted accordingly, it could bring a lot more stability. 
Inflationary currencies are something like a cheat code in a video game. Pay2Win players use it to give themselves money which lowers the value of all exisiting money (your money) and also lowers value of the huge debts they have from the military-industrial complex,t the banking/company bailouts + all the corroption.
In summary, they steal your money as you dont get a lot of the new supply because you are a peasant.

Same with Bitcoin?
The valuation is based on predictions. Even if they don't make any profits today the macro trends suggests that **cryptocurrencies** are becoming more and more popular and **Bitcoin** being a key player in it are predicted to take a slice of that market share, a market which is currently expanding. Obviously there's some faith in it too as they are predictions and thus everyone will have their own analysis of the market. But the key point is that there actually is an analysis made and not just a gut feeling.
You think there are no analysis made on Bitcoin? Theres a reason we have futures now.. theres a reason hedge funds jumped in... theres a reason JP Morgan did a 180 in the last days... theres a reason Japan made it legal tender... theres a reason China banned it... 
Bitcoin has been going up for 9 years, 0 hacks 0 downtime. Miners and adoption increasing every year. Technology developments are insane. SegWit, Lightining Network, MAST, Schnorr, MimbleWimble etc etc

Please tell me the rate that the Fed will have in 3 years. lol
The bitcoin inflation rate steadily trends downwards. It just happens to halve every 4 years. 
You have to read what the Austrian school has to say about that, but currently there is around 1+ quadrillion dollars of useless junk in the financial system and it just seems to be increasing so...
Deflation can cause a fall in prices. But calling falling prices "deflation" is a profound confusion between prosperity and depression. There are two distinct causes of generally falling prices. The leading cause of falling prices is economic progress, whose essential feature is an increasing production and supply of goods and services, which operates to make prices fall. The other is a decrease in the quantity of money and or volume of spending in the economic system. Falling prices is the only effect that they have in common. They differ profoundly with respect to their other effects.
Could people save more to buy stuff that lasts longer? Will people save to build stuff that helps in the long term? Will deflation allows us to save capital for bigger proyects? In the end everyone needs to eat and live.


True, the good thing is Bitcoin is totally voluntary to use. If you find that something else is better go ahead, maybe there could be a sort of battle between fiat, metals, oil, bitcoin etc. SDR style
They will have to do something crazy thats for sure. There is no avoiding a binge this intense.

Get real.

But nonetheless it WILL happen.  Just like when QE started anyone with half a brain KNEW stock prices would increase to retarded levels. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:54:00
Prices keep rising due to inflation, wages dont.
Who loses? Everyone who depends on wages (almost everyone)
 Who wins? Those who benefit from the stock market (almost nobody)

Are you seeing how fast governments around the world are integrating Bitcoin? Its naive to think they dont like it. As always just do the oppositr the media tells you. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:48:04
Why did you even buy in the first place? You knew it was highly volatile and risky af.
Did you even look at the historical graph? Did you expect to become a millionaire?
Why didnt you have a stop loss?
Are you for the long term? Then this doesnt  matter
@_date: 2018-07-05 06:47:27
Yes you can lol go read how and why Bitcoin works
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:07:12
The wave of people understanding why BTC is only getting bigger and also the wave of people getting angrier at our current system is increasing.

Remember guys theres no such a thing as a double bottom
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:12:54
Blackrock CEO says nobody has asked about BTC. Its a lie but it tells you that they wont push it to the average guy until they can stock it.
Thats why the futures where implemented so quickly. They needed a cap on the price to start the actual accumulation phase. Remember that even if they believed 100% that BTC was a scam, THEY LOVE SCAMS. They actually make most of their money from scams. They have been doing them since the financial markets began. So yeah just watch the trend but ignore the noise.

Inflation is good when used well, but it NEVER is. Neoclassical economics only works on paper not in real life.
Banks are corrupt, this is  a fact (their main activity is literally laundering money) . For some reason we let this private banks run the Fed.. What does corruption+ability to create money =??
How can a rational being argue that this is a good system?
Thirld world countries will prove how retarded central banks are anyways

Remember that the media made BTC look as if everyone was buying it and was clearly a bubble. In reality most people didn't buy and those that did barely dipped their toes. 
The bull run may take time but it will come. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:17:53
Yeah but if you follow the debt trail where does it lead to? We are basically paying for no reason to huge banks bc nobody wants to talk about cancelling debt which would help all the people but would hurt the rich, and when the rich feel hurt they retaliate with wars.
Yeah that video is pretty good. It basically says that we are bout to get WRECKED, son
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:34:29


































Why did you even buy BTC? You knew it was extremely volatile. Are you a long term investor or a trader?
You have to think before you act or you will keep getting rekted
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:48:42
Once we get open source miners crypto will change... 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:30:28
Yea but it will be peanuts compared to the profit. Thats why corporations have such an easy time buying politicians... for an individual 1 million is a lot but for a big corp its nothing if they can save 10x on the long run

What I am saying is that people trust that Elon Musk is going to make Tesla profitable at some point and thats why the valuation is high... 
Just like people trust that the Bitcoin ecosystem is going to keep growing and developing.... therefore providing more value than the current one...
There has never been a deflationary currency that is decentralized... 
The only thing I know is that the central banks of corrupt countries are going to fuck up sooner or later like they always do. When that happens Bitcoin will be there...
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:13:43
All of them secretly own Bitcoin, it would be retarded for them to not have it. They just cant say Bitcoin is a good investment because the FOMO it would cause would be unreal .... although its just a matter of time before it happens... 9 years 0% downtime 0 hacks just that is fucking amazing

Remember all the "hodlers" did sell a shitton at the top

What I am saying is that Bitcoin properties do not derive only from the open source code..... Without devs, miners and users your copy will be completely useless. Also its just a matter of time before the copies of BTC start getting attacked. Look at what BitPico is doing to BCH....

Go ahead a do it. Lets see if anybody gives a shit.
Theres a reason Bitcoin is still king after 9 years

Most people are talkers. When it comes to having skin on the game they bail.
Also it was basically uninformed people getting even more uninformed. The blind leading the blind.
The ones that did around me mostly bought anything but BTC which they said was old. Everyone likes to think that what they discovered first is the only and best thing to get.

The trick is not getting caught
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:20:34
I said similar levels of development... Its harder for users to use and understand Bitcoin since it requieres you to see the Truth of the financial system, but from the number of wallets and transactions Id say we are experiencing similar growth

BTC has worked perfectly since its creation. Its a success by every metric 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:44:39
Restrictions like sending money to Wikileaks, or sending money on the weekend, or sending money overseas, limits in your account, withdrawal costs, etc
When people dont have ownership of their money and we entrust somebody else with that reponsability they tend to use that money/power to do anything that can bring even more, which is usually fucking bad for us

@_date: 2018-04-18 09:16:37

Yes because thats the truth.....
"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"

It seems you are just another sheep that cant see past the price. Can you explain me why then does this asset have a futures market? Why does every big institution has investments in the exchanges? Why do regulators agree its here to stay and they should help it grow? 
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:29:52
I bet the number is way higher than we imagine, plus many people buy small amounts every day/week/month

Overtime this will have a huge impact on supply

Keep in mind that most of BTC gains occur in a very short period of time... so if you get out of the market its highly unlikely that you will be able to get back on time...
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:30:16
Its mind blowing how we accept this
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:17:33
What happened to those countries will continue to happen more and more.....

Low level trolling is annoying

If we let them join the global economy maybe they can do something that someone somewhere will think is valuable to them ans they will get BTC. 
Maybe you should be the one using your head.....

Because DBZ is amazing and very meme worthy

Not everyone has your work ethic standards, in fact is has been proven over and over that corporations use statistics to lie.

Yeah Im sure the next Jobs or Satoshi is slaving his life away there
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:11:23
Unless we change the system.... Thats the point of BTC.... Fixing the current problems from inside is impossible.... 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:47:42
Yes its hard atm, but everyone is working on making it simpler.
Anyways whats more likely that the poor village gets first, a bank or a cellphone? lol
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:21:40
The only real innovation is occuring in BTC..... The rest are literally just scams without working poduct. Even ETH is just a scam factory that everyone can own... 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:04:13
Depends on the stability of the currency in your country, many latin american countries will soon (5-10 years) experience a doze of Venezuelan magic... if that happens maybe it will be easier to measure things in satoshis :P
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:37:08
That's the problem... The rich can hide their money and use the best tax strategies......
Banks (criminal cartels) laundering and having control of money is the problem
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:02:57
You know people giving the loans lied to the customers right? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:12:50
The thing is that Bitcoin is for everyone to use. It has no restrictions... The possibilities that arise from that are endless
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:22:22
At the top of Bitcoin hype(google searches):
Daily Facebook searches is 9x
Google 9x
Amazon still 3x
Barely reached 1 day of twitter searches
Same hype as the Iphone 8
Pokemon GO was still 4x
Iphone 7 was 2x
Prince death 2x
How to buy slime had more searches globally than how to buy bitcoin...
We are very early guys...

So why cant I afford college, housing or hospitals anymore? Also where's my pension? 
Haha gtfo

Your line of thought doesnt work. Improve it or accept you are wrong and adapt
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:53:09
I think you should go complain about casinos, they do 1000000x more harm than BTC.....

Tone Vays is a hodler
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:12:58
Its that crypto morons trade with their entire stack... 1% is already a big trade
Tone Vays always reminds people that hes a hodler. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:18:03
It seems you are just another sheep that cant see past the price. Can you explain me why then does this asset have a futures market? Why does every big institution has investments in the exchanges? Why do regulators agree its here to stay and they should help it grow? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:06:55
Hyperwave broke, if 4k doesnt hold we will visit 1.3k before going back up. Sadly it seems likely
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:24:56
Support to continue wars? Hasnt this been the case in like 60% of the wars the US has been involved? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:16:42
Where did money from tax break go? Jobs and infrastructure? 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:18:03
Hyperwave was broken... We are going to 4k... Sorry moon boys

Check the wallets that havent moved since 2012
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:59:52
You are giving wayy too much importance to price... Exchange price for BTC doesnt mean anything as most trading occurs OTC and there is clearly still a lot of demand.... 
Market sentiment can change extremely fast.... 
You are also forgetting the exponential innovation going on in crypto... Bitcoin is here to stay... 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:37:31
Let me ask you something, would you rather get paid in bolivars or in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:37:35
You can still get loans...

People never talk about how organized crime is involved in most major events.... Theres a reason for that... They kill you if you do

Bitcoin went crazy due to shitcoins getting insane returns, now that the pyramid was completed Bitcoin price will return to its still fast but not insane climb to the moon.

Im not arguing for government. Im just saying that corporations behave in the same way as governments do. Thats why we need a new system built on Bitcoin as the base layer
