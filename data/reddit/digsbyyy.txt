I've done it. Blockchain fees like what was said. I like quad. Its basically our only half decent exchange as a canadian. The volume is low though. Sometimes the market feels stagnant in contrast to watching GDAX fly off the charts.

Hahaha rekt.

I would agree. To be quite honest, I've moved all my BTC over into alts. I'm tired of all the fucking bullshit between BTC and BCH. I'm not advising anyone do that, I'm taking my own risk. But Christ the BTC / BCH drama is too much.
I would not be mad if Roger got hit by a car.

Agreed. People can think all they want that BCH is some magical saviour to Bitcoin. But the truth is it doesn't have the TX volume BTC does. That and their block size increase a temporary bandaid fix to a great issue.

where do I buy $55 worth and receive said 55 million dollars back?

A friend and I started doing the same. Found that in order to truly make a good bot you'd need to be able to crunch a boat load of data. I'd be curious to see what you've done here.

Not too bad! So you could theoretically increase those gains by quite a bit with a few hundred thousand more data points. The problem is the computing power required to crunch that data. ML service on AWS and Azure gets pricey pretty fast.

That's pretty normal. I lost a bit before gaining a couple days later on my initial investment. You're buying into a volatile market. Once it goes up and finds better support at a higher value you'll secure some profit. Regardless it's only 4 bucks..

damn is thirsty.

Good and cheap are two things that don't belong in the same sentence here. I wouldn't waste your time. Anybody who's running a GOOD bot doesn't offer it on the low if they even offer it to the public at all. I've done a bunch of research on the subject and contemplated building my own. I quickly found out that the amount of data crunching required to build a GOOD bot would cost me an arm and a leg a month on server cost.

You're right but the accuracy of the bot would be insane if you managed to pump through a few million points of data. The issue is at that amount of data, you're looking at monthly server costs up into the 10's of thousands of dollars.
