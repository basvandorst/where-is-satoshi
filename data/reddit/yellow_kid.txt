Because they would have to redesign from scratch.

And then they post memes like "losers focus on winners, winners focus on winning", while 80% of the content in there is bitcoin bashing and conspiracy theories. The irony is too much.

So we should just take the word of strangers on the internet for it?

If you buy gold with money tokens that turns out to be fake the gold doesn't automatically lose value. But the guy you bought from got stuck bagholding fake money.

Why won't this meme just die already. The corporate dunce types keep repeating it louder and louder.




 
That's how retarded they sound.

Volume isn't everything, but it always means something. High volume doesn't just fall out of the sky, and most exchanges charge fees to trade.
Tether is a tiny fraction of the whole market cap of crypto. Even if we assume the market cap of crypto is effectively just something like 10% of the 500 billion, it's still  20x bigger than the total amount of minted usdt.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:40:58
Ugh, what question?
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:12:05
Ok I see what you mean there and you're right, but tether's market cap is like 2 billion while the whole crypto is 500 so I still think any effect on price would be psychological.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:34:54


But someone was selling for that price so that was the price.
Yea but anyway that can't possibly be the case with tether as most btc trading does not happen through it. Tether is a puny 2 billion matter, no matter what bitfinexed's bosses tell him to say.

Not "OK", there's the potential of double spend attacks. That's why people wait for confirmations.

Why not just do away with a static limit? A dynamic block size limit that would expand as/if network usage further increased, but also shrink if/when layer 2 solutions took root would be ideal.
If a hard fork is to be made might as well get it right the first time and get the block size debacles done with. I'd like to see such a proposal backed by core devs.

Technically no person ever sees the present as it takes micro seconds for your brain to form a perceptual experience from the sensory inputs.

I don't understand what you're disagreeing with. Journalists are oblivious and these opinion pieces are essentially worthless. We seem to be in agreement.

My bet is this is craig's new PR gimmick to imply he's Satoshi.
Interestingly this last week I saw some people argue with CSW's paid shill on 4chan against him being Satoshi. Often Nick Szabo is mentioned as an actually plausible candidate, including the fact that in 2008 Szabo pubclicly declared intent of releasing a live version of the bitcoin-like "bit gold" concept he had already written about.  Even though craig's PR agents tend to dilligently monitor discussions and reply to any anti-craig comment fairly quickly, when these facts about Szabo are bought up their reaction is ignoring and replying only to other comments.
What a coincidence that now someone is trying to fabricate a similar story for craig.

List of cons:
1. It will require a subscription fee;
2. It's a "hub and spoke" network;
3. Wait, actually it's vaporware.

Lol no. He's the living stereotype of the manipulative salesman, but with a sociopath twist:
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:30:37
If craig were Satoshi why would he steal any amount of bitcoin at all from anyone ever? This doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:05:30
Just the ones that are known to have hired PR firms to help perpetuate fraud, i.e. craig.
