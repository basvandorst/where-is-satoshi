Someone who graduated in Dutch Tax Law here. You're completely wrong. The only reason why you can consider NL a 'tax haven' is because the Netherlands has never taxed royalty payments. The Starbuck thing works in that way that for every coffee they have to pay a royalty to the Dutch Starbucks company that holds the rights to the royalty. Which as you now know is not taxed in the Netherlands. 
Since I don't see why bitpay would use royalty's at all, their normal operations (profit) will be taxed at a rate of 25%.
TL;DR: The Netherlands is only a tax haven if you focus on one tiny peace of tax law (royalty's).

I know. But it is unfair to put the Netherlands with a Corporate tax rate of 25%, a progressive income tax (52% above € 54,000 a year) and a 21% sales tax in the same bracket as a tax haven like the cayman islands which has a 0% corporate tax rate and a 0% income tax.
