So with OneName, now all of your social media/identity info is on the blockchain... irreversibly. Even if you dont put it on yourself, they or another anonymous entity might do it for you. The entire internet could be fed through this filter, which essentially molds the experience of all these networks into one user experience.

well, bitcoin transactions go to bitcoin wallet addresses. even with login/verification process, the bitcoins could be sent anywhere. 
I suspect that this can be done via colored coins, i.e. inserting the IP address data into the padding of a transaction

You would have to make periodic trips to physically exchange currencies...
Like say someone in Brasil wants to send BRL to the United States... Instead of paying the *20% bank transfer rate, they go to you. You accept their BRL and send the apportioned amount of BTC to a BTC/USD cash service, where the BTC would be tendered. The money gets to the final destination, and then you have your clients cash. Only thing is to get more BTC, you need to buy in again, and you don't want to spend 20% transfer rate to top up your own "CoinbaseBrazil" wallet.... You're selling off BTC and getting stuck with a limited currency. Most other currencies have geopolitical barriers.  I think that for the moment, BTC is labeled volatile, so this doesn't yet make sense for westernunion like idea, but I'm positive that creative approaches will be taken. I'd also like to see this discussion come up more often.

i got verified today. I don't think any user has USD on the site, so it makes it hard to sell BTC. I couldnt even sell my BTC below market price to get USD. It was kind of ridiculous. This could be great, though it is a stalemate for the moment. Once cryptsy has USD market, they will have hard competition.

this needs to be marked as misleading,

whered u get this chart?

buying other alt currencies with bitcoin could have a potential benefit, but as of right now bitcoin is trending up so hold onto that.

all good, some critical bearish patterns did not form completely.

my indicators have it going to 500+, not sure on the time frame though...

Right, like the chinese passing 1000 CNY/BTC today. From what I notice the main psychological indicators of price flux are based around significant numbers like this that indicate a breaking down of a barrier. Looking at the order books confirms this. Also price action also seems to be based round previous highs, such as the 168USD point which was the rally for the the april BTC drop. Once BTC goes past the 250USD April spike, say goodbye. BTC will be going going gone.

i dont have face book, but do they have an update on their page there? This might be them updating their engine to Midas.

LTC is much faster than BTC. It seems to me a very practical advantage that the coin may have. With 4x the amount of coins that BTC will have, it is undervalued. I consider it to be an investment with long term (10years) payoff... whereas BTC has short-term payoff
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:55:55
really? what currencies have they had experience with?
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:56:49
ha. i like this.
@_date: 2013-10-25 14:06:53
now would be a good time to stop
@_date: 2013-11-17 09:37:41
cool. I hope it comes to philly next.
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:43:34

I do think that copyleft ant the BTC community complement eachother greatly, I'm not sure what your getting at though, it sounds a bit exclusionist, and perhaps scheming.
