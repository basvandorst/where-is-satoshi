A lot of the proposals have to be implemented for this to become truly possible in an efficient and secure manner, but essentially the support for these types of things is an end goal.

Not yet, I need to make a formal page / process of explanation (especially if people are going to be asking "What's Bitcoin" when we put up a Bitcoin sign in the office) :] we'll discuss this tomorrow.

It sure would be, I only trust stuff I can compile myself when it comes to Bitcoin wallets. (Even 3rd party financial tools unrelated to Bitcoin, if it doesn't come from an SEC compliant company, there's no one to take the blame, so I can't inherently trust it.) I just haven't seen a tool specifically designed for recovery after format. I've seen ones for corrupted wallets, but nothing tailored to this purpose.

Wow, that's very neat. However how do you protect against a blatant chargeback of a malicious user? (EG: Someone just takes the money and runs, essentially.)

Hi HighBeamHater, I'm the lead developer that works on Bitcoins For Charity, and like it says on the website, we choose only to list charities that have their own Bitcoin address to accept donations at, so we don't have to deal with any paperwork (in the event that there was, if there were any) and can be 100% transparent about what we help raise for charity. We currently don't even have a Bitcoin 'tip' address on the website.
Currently, the only charity listed is the Free Software Foundation; we did a soft launch today while I'm building the dynamic portion of the website to aggregate, list and sort through the rest of the charities.

What prevents people from doing chargebacks?

Updated my comment, sorry about that!

Can't this be annulled since it's easy to prove Bitcoin was in circulation and use before June 22, 2011?

You should put the actual Reddit ticker instead of just the submit button. Otherwise, cool idea! Is the prize really a full Bitcoin?

Apparently the 432,000 transfer was them securing the remaining liquid assets @ Mt. Gox to a new, uncompromised location:

You forgot to mention the actual place you work at accepts Bitcoin, too! ;)

What in your eyes remains to be done with it? (Just installed FF6 beta and am in a foxy kind of mood if you know what I mean.) ;)

I'm converting it to reupload to Vimeo now, it seems I don't have Director privileges on YouTube anymore. I apologize.

Wrote about this just a bit ago, screenshot included for those who missed out on the Pudding Pops.
