Thanks, I've made a few smaller transfers but all of them were below 0.1 btc. I'm unseasoned to how everything goes, but I actually just now received it in my wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 06:27:48
Yea I'm in the middle of transferring a majority of the funds out of the hot wallet, I should have done that as soon as I could
@_date: 2016-08-01 06:33:18
Damn, I heard some rumors about Coinbase recently. But then again their are always rumors about Coinbase. That sounds pretty likely tho with everything happening these past few days. Is it all FUD that caused the drop or what's going on with that? I been reading a lot since yesterday trying to find out what news there is on it and what others are saying.
@_date: 2017-02-01 20:28:19
Unfortunately not in the USA, over in other countries tho you dont. The USA gov will never let human innovation thrive, you can count of them to hinder it and steal from everything in the form of taxation. Fancy word for theft. And if someone doesnt pay taxes, violent force gets used against them. So these demands for taxes (theft) are backed by the threat of violent force. No matter how you wanna look at it, it breaks down to theft and violence.
@_date: 2017-02-01 09:34:55
Yeah meters would be one of those things you'd need fiat for, some take debit cards but the ones around where im usually at just take change. A lot of people seem to use Xapo cards, idk if its because its been around longer or what, i was thinking about getting one but I just recently got a Bitpay debit card and have been using it for most things. Is bitcoin used a lot in South Africa or is there any restrictions or taxes on it there? In the USA there is and its ridiculous, otherwise I know a lot more people would be using it for more things.
@_date: 2017-02-01 08:07:00
Its hard to break from it entirely, with all the fees still tied into everything its difficult to rid all of the legacy. Damn yeah thats true with the Xapo cards being not entirely bitcoin, been using a bitcoin debit card myself a lot since i got it recently. I think im gonna set a goal to do that too, where can you get your necessities tho where you can do wallet to wallet other then online? Thatd be ideal, i guess with purse.io and overstock there is a majority of the things you might need available on there. Its dissapointing how little amount of brick and mortar stores accept direct bitcoin payments tho. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 10:41:53
Are you outside of the USA, cause its a lot easier im pretty much every other country, except Iceland. Its worse there. Vermont is the worst US state, but most countries arent hindering bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies like the US does. Hoping crypto changes from being considered personal property to something else, at least a commodity. Would be great if it was just left alone by the gov, they just cant let human evolution and innovation thrive. Always hindering our growth, they just have to steal off people in the form of taxation. Its theft plain and simple, backed by the threat of violent force of course. I wish Uber started accepting bitcoin, they did in Argentina, but only because the gov there banned banks and credit card companys from providing a payment method for Uber. Yeah getting paid in bitcoin is tricky and dependent on the company. Bitwala is a way, but its still using a bank and taking 2%. But thats not too bad for not supporting the legacy system.
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:33:32
That isnt gonna happen if you use wallets with xpub keys, or you can use a different wallets. If you use the same address and same wallet for everything the yea that could happen theoretically, but its very unlikely. Plus most wallets offer xpub keys now anyways.
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:47:12
Why would they need to open additional bank accounts? Or is it cause their current bank might not allow transfers to and from Coinbase/Glidera?
@_date: 2017-02-14 06:52:32
Oh thank you i really appreciate it, that is what i was looking for exactly. Makes a lot more sense now
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:24:58
Oh i dont believe so either, some whales just probably cashed out but some whales are probably buying in because its low. The ride is going. People in the USA are getting their tax dollars back at any point so that should effect the value soon 
@_date: 2017-02-01 08:00:11
Lol same here, any savings should be in bitcoin, why wouldnt it be. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:47:01
We do have trepidation of FIAT! And the US gov do grab as much money as they can all the time and run off with it. They use it for various things like alphabet agencies, LE and of course lots of war to steal from more people. If someone is ok with knowing that your money is being stolen in the form of taxation and funding the harm of innocent people then they are something else. Bitcoin is ethically a much better currency for that very reason, and many many other reasons.
@_date: 2017-02-02 19:42:30
The EU definitely sounds like its been getting better, they are always a good ways ahead of the USA with stuff regarding freedom and collective advancements, i know we would be able to be a lot further ahead then we are currently over here if it wasnt for having a government that holds us back so much and taxes every possible thing heavily. Yeah i just found that out about Uber the other day, it would be nice if Lyft and Uber started doing that everywhere or at least allowing drivers to make it available as a payment method if they would want to. A lot of people have been against Uber lately for various reasons, i mainly dont like their privacy practices, but wouldnt not use them if needed. I try to take Lyft whenever i need a ride, but there is a new decentralized service called LibreTaxi thats supposed to be available everywhere and they will accept bitcoin and i think some other cryptocurrencies too. Just heard about LibreTaxi yesterday, i need to look into them more. I think businesses would be more likely to accept and pay their employees in bitcoin if they knew how easy it is, with Bitpay its pretty easy, its mapped out real well in their application and has a real good and simple UI. The lightning network will be really good, everything ive heard sounds like it will be a big move forward for bitcoin. Havent read a ton about it but its been talked about frequently in some of the videos i watch about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:17:49
I know, thats what im talking about. But the BTC value at the time of funding isnt fluctuating much in reflection to the going rate. At least not how youd imagine it would, sort of inconsistent or however it does isnt making sense to me.
@_date: 2017-02-01 08:12:53
True, of course the western world has hindered human innovation once again to make way for the fed coin. Cash has advantages still, yeah until bitcoin can replace every little thing its gonna be difficult to rid the fiat. I only use it on an as needed basis tho
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:11:54
Probably, yeah most likely unless there is a better way that isnt too costly. Like a Raspberry Pi or something
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:47:44
Oh really, damn i never heard of them. Thats weird they folded up, was there no reasoning behind that?
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:10:36
i am wondering if some of this BU fork is FUD and an attempt to get the price lowered before it goes back up after bitcoin unlimited fails or never happens. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 06:18:17
That makes no sense about paying in large sums of bitcoin, how is it different from anything else of value? There isnt anything specifc about it that makes it a problem. Someone can slip someone a paper demanding many things of value. It is true about the cops not knowing how to deal with the subject, most probably know nothing about it at all. At best they may of heard of it or know that its some sort of digital currency.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:54:25
no, im asking who the hell is actually concerned about anyone other then the governments. Thats all that matters, id much rather have some random person accessing my money then the gov
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:12:30
Yeah now that you mention it I'm wondering that too
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:27:17
Ohh ok, yeah that makes sense then why theyd be having transactions haulted on Coinbase. Hopefully theyll be up and running soon
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:30:42
What if he is the real Satoshi Nakamoto?
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:39:26
thats important tho cause once the ETF goes thru the price of bitcoin will possibly go above 5-6k very briefly, possibly before the ETF changes or posts the approval status
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:17:19
What are the problems with the Gemini exchange?
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:27:36
Ok decentralization is crucial and so is p2p and security of the funds. If there is a way to go about improving bitcoin without a fork wouldnt that be better?
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:07:12
What possibly could they be trying to do tho, i guess prevent Coinbase from closing their account. But thats about it. I cant stand when someone mentions the invasive spouse scenario
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:36:19
i've heard great things about Mycelium, John McAfee always talks highly of the Mycelium app and Trezor hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:34:41
what do you mean hive went bust?
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:34:56
What is the AWS outrage?
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:25:14
Yes there should definitely not be any form of central governing of bitcoin, or anything for that matter. Reaching a collective agreement is better or having no central governing whatsoever would be ideal, sort of like the plan with Ethereum originally. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 00:55:21
Thanks, that makes a little more sense. But there is a lot of stuff that doesnt make sense to a lot of people it sounds. So if you bought 0.1 btc from Coinbase and then sent it to your Airbitz wallet later that day would that be considered selling it? If so how would you know the rate at which it was sold? I've been hearing that is considered a sell when you transfer it from Coinbase to a different wallet. It's ridiculous but thats what I'm hearing its considered. Also if you bought 0.1 btc in October then bought 0.15 btc in November and transfered or spent 0.2 btc how would you find out how much your gains tax would be since you bought the 0.1 and 0.15 at different times and at different rates?
@_date: 2017-01-16 10:18:48
Im just wondering what everyone else is doing, jesus christ. We dont even believe in taxes, its theft by definition. But we gotta do what is required to avoid the violence the government backs their laws by.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:41:43
Yeah i understand, it doesnt matter who created it really. I just wonder where the idea came from because its so complex. I used to think it could of been an idea that was influenced by how banks store their digital money since about 97% of all fiat money in the USA is in non physical form. But after seeing Bamking on Bitcoin i understand more where the idea may of stemmed from, BitInstant and BitGold and some other startups
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:53:22
Oh nice, thanks i appreciate your help
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:30:25
Chill the fuck out, there is no other subreddit where any perspectives on this question will be shared. Its a question that only a smaller amount of people will be able to even know about
@_date: 2017-01-17 00:49:22
If you bought $75 worth of bitcoin in November and then spent $60 worth of it in December, would you have to include that in any documentation?
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:08:39
Are people holding off on transactions until they get their tax returns?
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:33:51
Damn, they do? I wondered if they did or how focused on privacy they are. Should've known. Whats a good opensource mixer?
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:36:00
So any bitcoin in my bitpay wallet is no longer bitcoin? So it got converted to bitcoin cash or is it no longer usable on the bitcoin network?
@_date: 2016-11-02 18:21:21
Damn I remember reading that when I set my wallet up, but didn't know how that works really. How do you uninstall the ledger wallet bitcoin in Ubuntu? I'm trying to figure it out now
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:48:03
Oh okay so they take 2% out of your paycheck for the service. Thats cool that they can split direct deposits, tho idk if my employer would do that. How much more rigorous would the verification be compared to Coinbase? I dont fully understand xpubkey but from how you described it I have a general idea of how it may work. So would your paycheck go directly to the Bitwala wallet or could it directly go into a third party wallet like Ledger or Mycelium? 
@_date: 2016-11-02 13:54:33
Oh really you just have to uninstall it and reinstall, that's a relief then. Was getting pretty worried since I store all of my bitcoin on there. Didn't know other people have issues with their Nano S, I emailed Ledger support and they said it didn't look like anything on there side that was wrong. But I'm gonna reinstall the app today, thanks for helping me out with this.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:54:11
wow, i cant believe no one at Coinbase was aware of what would happen until the fork was actually implemented. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:49:10
Yeah of course the check would be written for the senders bank, but can the reciever take that paper check and put that into bitcoin without using an additional bank to convert it?
@_date: 2016-12-16 02:17:43
Is there not a company i can give my check to in exchange for bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:15:25
They just never commited it seems, its funny how people argue that "you cant hold bitcoin in your hands" but how the fuck would commerce work it everything had to be physical. Jesus Christ, thats lile reverse evolution. Its the people who cant wrap there head around bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Just the thought of it gives them a headache and they often assume its something coders and techies can only figure out. When in reality companies like Coinbase couldnt make it any easier to aquire.
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:11:52
Lol i forgot about that, they do haha. Jesus christ, theyre awful
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:48:54
I figured there had to be some service that could do it, are there any well known ones or which services do you know of that do that? Just to list a few off
@_date: 2017-01-24 06:52:16
You are right about another cryptocurrency, it will just shift to a new one. I know this is a bad comparison and i really hate synthetic drugs, but seeing what the US did to try to ban synthetic drugs and all the other analogs by trying to enact a coverall law on synthetic drugs or any analog substance that produces mind or mood altering effects and how it did not stop anything at all, I can see the same thing happening if a government tried to ban all digital currencies that arent given government permission specifically thru some type of legal application process that meets certain conditions. Any digital currency could be considered something else thru legal fiction, it could be considered a digital commodity, or a code or a digital sticker or whatever it needs to be considered to bypass any legislation.
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:36:29
I didnt know you can buy bitcoin on Uphold, damn thats cool. Is it the Uphold app or their desktop site or both that you can buy it from
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:55:18
What keyboard on ios is it? I cant find it in the stock emojis and i have ios 10.2
@_date: 2016-11-16 09:00:39
I agree with you for sure, ten cents is nothing for being your own bank. Boycotting is the idea also. I'm surprised that some conglomerate like Google hasn't started doing free transactions in turn for selling every stitch of data possibly extracted from your account and interactions. They probably have something in the works, or maybe it's still to risky for Google to be involved. Then again Google is a government front company and most likely would be the biggest advocate against bitcoin, saluting the banks and the concept of fiat.
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:17:02
Oh there isnt, damn I must of been confused with the dormancy fee. Thats better tho cause Ill be using it enough each month to avoid it. Thank you, I appreciate it.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:23:27
True yeah I definitely can see that being the case in a lot of the people and  agree with what you are saying about having a good mix of hedges. The bitcoin network would be very different if the US government started charging people with felonies or something not even that harsh for mining, selling or using bitcoin. And even more different if many of the world governments were doing the same in other countries. Hopefully it never gets to that point, but I can see governments trying to stop or at least regulate it heavier when it starts having a big enough impact on the population and its effecting fiat significantly. Id imagine if it effected even 5% of the US Dollar there would be some sort of intervention or shut down on the exchanges located within the US. If the government does that tho they are seriously hindering human innovation and bringing us back into the stone age. But it wouldnt be the first time, so I wouldnt be too surprised. Not surprised by anything really anymore.
@_date: 2016-12-24 09:50:23
Huh thats odd then, when I tried to log on it wouldnt go to the site because it said the connection isnt secure. Then i tried logging on from a different computer and of course I had to confirm that I authorize that computer thru an email, but the link in the email wasnt working. Like you couldnt even click on it where it said "I authorize this computer." It was just text and not even an active link. Of all times to not be able to get on GDAX too, I cant buy bitcoin off of the Coinbase app at a 4% merchant fee. Thats ridiculously high. What other sites sell bitcoin that take credit card and arent as high as Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:41:01
Damn ive heard some bullshit that originated from Zerohedge, ill have to read some articles just to get a kick out of it. It is sad tho, pisses me off. These people making that trash should transfer there shit to bitcoin as they can, feel like they already are just with a bad attitude about it. Probably because their predictions didnt come true
@_date: 2016-12-24 10:26:39
Yeah, thats too bad. Whats ACH?
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:40:10
Yeah it does seem like people here dont trust Coinbase. When is the fork supposed to happen?
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:43:52
Or if you cant figure out the exact amount is overpaying it a little going to suffice?
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:30:55
I have a Ledger Nano S, why do you think itd be better to let Ledger spread out the fork coin?
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:40:21
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:42:24
Coinbase just suspended transactions because its happening in the next 6 hours, only wallet send/receives have been suspended on there
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:28:36
I couldnt figure out anything but seen the email Coinbase sent
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:42:56
Do you know if most tax accountants would be able to help with it, what about the whole Coinbase issue with everytime you send bitcoin being considered spent/sold bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:41:30
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:14:37
Yeah it does seem to be a less common thing right now, Bitwala seems to be the most popular but its 2% of the pay in order to convert it.  Thats cool tho that you can split it up, they didnt even have direct deposit where i worked at before lol. Idk how to go about getting paid in actual bitcoin, that would be ideal tho. If your employer is knowledgeable with bitcoin and cool maybe he could find a way but its not something that is very common to happen id imagine. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:39:47
Denied is what it says, so it's not delayed. What needs to happen in order to try again?
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:37:49
So it got denied, that means what then in order to try again? 
@_date: 2016-10-12 06:39:35
Yea but I wanna know as soon as possible for I can pull if needed 
@_date: 2016-10-12 12:47:08
They're gonna be going sideways. lol they'll go up if a company signs the ETF. If not they'll drop down. Probably around $20 at least.
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:02:36
It is actually delayed, I was wrong. Not sure if some changes need to be made for bats and the rules proposal or if it's just gonna be delayed until they can try again to get signed by a company and approval from the SEC.

Go to a headshop and get one of those stash cans
@_date: 2016-10-25 07:14:04
Yeah I agree with him, definitely mention that and make clear the difference between decentralized currency and fiat currency. And mention that bitcoin is finite, there is only 21 million bitcoins. But bitcoin breaks down to 8 decimal places, while the dollar is not finite and breaks down to 2 decimal places. Explain how bitcoin is consistently going up in value and show them graphs of the past week/month/year if you can. And maybe list off a bunch of the places you can spend it and how to spend it at places that don't accept it directly.
