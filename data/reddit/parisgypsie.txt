History seems to show that individual people are pretty average, make mistakes every now and then, and fuck up (see: every post on r/bitcoin of people losing/not properly securing their bitcoins). People are lazy. They don't want to figure out the intricacies of Bitcoin. It's much easier to off-load that onto someone who does know what they're doing (like a bank). Especially when it's free, like every decent bank offers. Couple that with some FDIC insurance that we all pay taxes for anyway, and you're good to go. No waking up and seeing that your entire savings is gone because you downloaded train_album.avi which had a Bitcoin virus in it.


Unfortunately that database takes ten minutes to process a transaction as legit, and since we've been raised on instantaneous credit card transactions, I don't think this is an improvement to anyone. Also, note that mainstream consumers do not give a shit whether you think the government or banks or credit cards are "corrupt." The bank stores my money. It works. I don't really care if the federal reserve keeps printing money. It has a minimal effect on my life.


Chargebacks don't charge the customer, who are the driving force behind which currencies fail and which succeed. You have to cater to the customer if you want to succeed. Credit cards will cover your losses as well if your card is stolen. Consumers have literally zero disadvantages with using credit cards. I'm curious how much the total amount of Bitcoin lost, scammed, and stolen as well as the cost of mining equipment and the coal-plant powered electricity used to power them totals to?


Credit cards work great on the internet. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.


Is this vague terminology supposed to make me feel good? "Digital global network for payments." I can buy stuff anywhere in the world with my credit card online, dude. That sounds digital and global to me.


Until society (or the Bitcoin cult) decides it doesn't value it anymore. Are you seriously saying that you trust society's valuation of Bitcoin more than say, whether or not the US government will exist tomorrow (which is what backs USD)?


Is this QVC? "Limited technology?" WTF? Paying in seconds? 600 seconds maybe... Totally secure? People can barely manage a simple computer password, do you really think entrusting them with the security of their own life savings is a good idea? Or anything close to secure?


Now you're just fucking with me.


Is this what you guys are calling the yearlong downtrend?


Just shy of 400 dollars according to society, currently.


Oh wait, but I thought Bitcoin gets rid of the risk of chargebacks? All these Bitcoin risks, though? Fuck you business, that's your problem!

Is 80%-90% not close enough to a true monopoly to reap the benefits? That 10% can't have the infrastructure, ad revenue, or brand identity and loyalty of a near-monopoly to compete.


Microsoft in its heyday reached a market share of 97%.
This sub flipped out when a company reached a simple majority of market share. Was that fear unfounded? Maybe. Time will tell whether ghash stopped growing because of the market or an internal move to monopolize at a later point.
Government force creating monopolies is for simple stuff like utilities, where a regulated monopoly is the only sane way to build infrastructure. Projects with huge infrastructure costs gravitate towards monopolies simply because of the start-up capital required. Which is why internet needs to be a utility and be regulated *more* to where a provider is given a monopoly and can't provide shitty internet at a shitty price. Your electric provider can't give shitty electricity for a shitty price, why should internet?
Regulation is key. Do you want 8 different water companies laying 8 different sets of pipe across the whole town? Electrical poles and wires? When one company establishes itself as the provider and finishes the infrastructure necessary, it can streamline the system and offer competitive prices because it doesn't have to fund infrastructure. A start-up company entering the same market can't offer competitive rates because it has to finance infrastructure.
The fixed costs are too high. I can start a small store to serve a small number of customers and slowly grow my business. I can't start a small electric company because the income from a small amount of residents will never be enough to cover the fixed costs inherent to an electric company.
If there are four different electric companies that serve a quarter of the population of the town each, then those fixed costs are distributed to only a quarter of the population, leading to a high cost of electricity. If one company has the whole market, those equivalent fixed costs are distributed across a larger group of people, and so a lower cost of electricity.
Monopolies and regulation have a place in society. I can't wait to see how Bitcoin's free market intends to provide my electricity and water for a cheaper price than current "monopolies."

For the checking, you're allowing the bank to reinvest your money, and it's also a cheap service the bank can offer for free to entice you to explore other things like savings accounts, debit and credit cards, and loans that are more lucrative for the bank. It's more a mutually beneficial relationship/loss leader.
As for the FDIC, that would be your taxes funding that. Also if you use Bitcoin, you still have to pay taxes that go towards an organization you can't even use.
The gold thing: I don't think Germany's $1.41 billion of gold is stored under the same terms of contract that individual depositors to a local bank receive. I don't know everything about the situation, but maybe the bank has a certain amount of time before they must give the funds back or any other number of reasons stipulated in the contract.


Louisiana is part of a first-world nation that has the FDIC so yes a run on banks would not be a problem. If you're talking nationwide run on banks, then you have a global economic crisis (read: gonna be hard to find bread and water from here on out) on your hands and no start-up internet currency will be saving the day.


Is the European Central Bank insured? Is that even possible? I'm not really familiar with European banking, but if the entire system in Europe collapsed, then yeah we have the same economic crisis as before except the US dollar is still worth something (and England should be fine, since they wisely stuck with the pound). 
But again, how is Bitcoin going to save the day? Is Bitcoin self-sufficient at this point? Unless entire industries are running on Bitcoin and paying their employees in Bitcoin, it's going to be hard to get employees to drive trucks to deliver you your food or let you buy it in the grocery store.
This all assumes you fixed the dozen other problems with Bitcoin as well. I'd get your currency up to par with current ones (easy to use, consumer protections, inability for corporations to control half the market (isn't that the point of Bitcoin? How did you fail that?)). Then maybe you can build a supercurrency that can save the day when the US dollar crashes.

Despite all that, the members of this subreddit still think this thing is going to revolutionize the world any day now. It's near cult status at this point. That's what makes this a train wreck.
I don't know what the price will be tomorrow or what it will be in a month. I can tell you that Bitcoin will still not have conquered the world, and it won't in every month after that.

I do see Bitcoin succeeding as a currency for black market deals, it really shines in that area. It *might* even become more popular for those needing to send large amounts of currency internationally. Other than that though, I don't really see it taking off. Visions of it becoming the new worldwide currency and replacing fiat seem pretty delusional to me.

If an appliance doesn't last long enough, then you'll buy from a different company that offers a more durable product. The first company you bought from never gets the repeat business.
Also, more durable products cost more. A lot of people just want the cheapest thing that works, and are okay with buying a new one every 5 years instead of 10. You can offer a durable product but you'll have to have a higher price point so your company can afford the extra material and stay in the business until it's finally time to sell another product. Unfortunately, the vast majority of consumers don't care about durability. To them, every washer in the showroom looks about the same; they're looking at the price tags.

Umm, I'm pretty sure they're not adopting alternate currencies because they are **useless** as currencies. I cannot pay my electric or water bills or my rent with Bitcoin. I can't buy groceries with Bitcoin. I can't pay my tuition with Bitcoin. It's about as useless as Euros would be for someone in the US. 
OP's friend could have just said "Yeah I'm not going to accept your speculative digital currency as payment for this debt." What then? No court is going to make him accept it. You'll have to pay in US currency, the only currency recognized by the US that you must accept in payment for a debt.
I also could have bought Apple stock before it went big and be a millionaire today, but I didn't. No use beating myself up over it. Or making fun of the general public for not trading in it. That's what bitcoin is: a speculative investment. Not a currency.

Western Union doesn't have high fees just because they can (that's part of the reason). There's an insane amount of overhead when you're sending money across borders.

There's no reason for Bitcoin to be what everyone immediately switches to though.

Well, why the hell wouldn't they? If you demonstrate that you can't pay your debts in a reasonable time frame, then you don't deserve to have more money loaned to you. If you just want a safe place to store your money, as other posters have mentioned, banks will gladly do that without a credit check. They can invest it elsewhere and make money off you that way, no loans required.
Bitcoin replacing banks is retarded. There's nothing keeping you from running off with other people's money (regulation is bad right guyz? /s) and every third post on this sub is about some idiot sending all their coins to the wrong address with no way to get it back (anonymous transactions are good, right guyz? /s).

Sorry, but you guys are going to end up reinventing the wheel. People are selfish. Government and a society as a whole are required to keep things orderly. Self-regulation doesn't work on any large scale. Consumers will never accept a currency that affords them no protections. Greedy companies will take you for everything you have and disappear because Bitcoin has no regulatory authority.
You guys all saw a few cons with how modern currency operates, and forgot to look at all of the pros. Now you just have a (broken) currency that has none of the pros of USD plus a whole new set of cons.
But that's all beside the point. First thing you guys need to do is stablize the exchange rates between Bitcoin and USD. It will never go mainstream until the volatility goes away. Until then you're all just gambling on a (very) risky stock. Nothing more, nothing less.

It's all those great things that make fiat so useful that make it "expensive".

I guess that would mean the entire fucking collapse of a large portion of the world economy. I'm sure everyone's first move is to set up Bitcoin payment protocols and bow down to the Bitcoin early adopters.
More likely, there would be rioting, looting, probably no electricity, and have fun with your internet tokens.
Even more likely, the dollar is still here in 10 years, or USD 2.0 is. Most citizens do not care how much money the FED prints or who gets rich off of it as long as they have a way to buy things at reasonable prices and feed their family. Simple as that.

We already have a currency that works. We aren't scared of the government because we're not paranoid. Most of us don't need to internationally trade currency. We just want to pay rent and bills, and put food on the table. When a vendor fucks us over, we like having consumer protections that enable us to get our money back. We don't dabble in risky investments.
Bitcoin has zero improvements over USD for pretty much everyone. Most of us are down-to-earth people. Bitcoin is just not useful to most people as a currency. Don't fault people for not being interested in it right now.

And that's because companies like Apple depend a lot on public perception. The only reason they can charge so much for their products is because they're perceived as hip, cool, trendy, cohesive, dependable, and reliable within the closed ecosystem. They try really hard not to mess up because that ruins their public image. If they mess up, they do their best to fix it and repair that public image, because that's what their livelihood depends on.
Bitcoin is just a protocol and if you double pay it gives zero fucks.

You have to admit gets a little cultish sometimes. The whole "to the moon" stuff and posting articles that have barely any relevance to Bitcoin in some vain attempt to keep it relevant. Your latest big events have been buying Bitcoin from the government you despise, multiple posts about Bitcoin extortion (so much for good PR), one of the largest exchanges collapsing and taking everyone's coins, and daily posts about people being scammed.
This doesn't even mention the delusional visions some people in this subreddit have of Bitcon replacing fiat (it's not gonna happen before Reddit's main demographic reaches retirement age, I'll tell you that much). So calm the fuck down. It's cool to talk about the pros of your digital currency, and where you can spend it, but you guys need to be more realistic. Fiat is successful for a reason, you can try on improve on it, but you've somehow managed to lose all the good things of fiat in the process, making it look like a step back.
And the price thing. You guys refuse to recognize that things are looking bad. A core developer backing out made the front page, and none of you bat an eye. I'm not saying quit at the first sign of trouble, but falling prices are usually bad, and not "yay cheaper bitcoins to buy". This is how people go broke. Everything is not good for Bitcoin. If you want your currency to go mainstream, start acting a little more sane and down-to-earth.
You guys probably won't take any of this advice, though, so is here to catalog the idiocy for posterity.

This doesn't make Bitcoin inherently bad, but I don't think you should be playing up this aspect if you want it to be accepted as a legitimate currency by the general public. You act like illegal drugs and contraband are good for society.
As for the government watching you part of your post, is that really a problem? I don't really think they keep tabs on you as much as you think they do (you're kind of acting a little delusional). Unless you're famous, have a high-profile job or position, or are part of some large criminal organization, I don't think the government really cares about you.
You act like a "fascist, corrupt, banana republic" is what our country is going to be in *one generation*? I seriously doubt that.


Are those important things the aforementioned illegal drugs and contraband? Those aren't as important as say bread and milk to feed your kids. I'd like to see a list of these "important things" that every person can buy with Bitcoin "today."


Yes, but can you *use* it without access to the Internet or power. I sure as hell can use my USD without power. If anything, it would be *harder* for the government to keep tabs on me by using cash.
You haven't countered my point that Bitcoin's price fluctuates, either. How are you going to convince people to spend it when everyone is hoarding it? Why spend it on the "important things in life today" that you mention when I can hoard it and buy twice times as many "important things" a month from now.

PayPal/Amazon is pretty fast. Buying money on an exchange, handling wallets, deciding if vendors are a scam or not is not so fast.


How many international transactions do you think the average joe is doing? Bascially zero. Most people don't have this problem.


Already covered this, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say setting up and using a Bitcoin is a *little* harder than fiat.


Is.... this a problem where you live? My government seems pretty cool with the currency we use and has not yet threatened to take it away. I'll let you know if anything develops, though.


This is why Bitcoin fails. Businesses don't drive the market, consumers do. Consumers will shop where their money is safe, they don't care about the safety of the vendor. If I'm dropping $1000 on a computer do I use a credit card so I can get my money back if the vendor doesn't deliver, or do I use Bitcoin where the vendor *may* deliver and if he doesn't I'm shit out of luck? What do you think the average person is going to choose?


I guess you're talking about data breaches and stuff. If that really concerns you then I guess you can use an anonymous currency where you have to type in a 30 character alphanumeric code (so fast and easy to use) to send money. For most people though, data breaches aren't that dangerous. Banks can refund you your money, and credit cards can reimburse you when the charges are obviously fraudulent. Someone steals your Bitcoin wallet? You're shit out of luck.


This is getting into economics way beyond my ability, but I don't think this is that bad. At least USD doesn't change wildly every week. Bitcoin can't even maintain a stable price, good luck becoming a currency anytime soon.


You don't have to broadcast your fiat transactions on a megaphone either. Also average joe is not doing anything secret with his money. The government could care less he spends his paycheck at Taco Bell and on the electric bill.


Only the vendors who *may* steal my money and the speculative investments that are the only thing holding this currency together.

It's also incredibly inconvenient. What about keeping a physical copy of your passwords? Disguise it as a letter or invoice and keep it in a locked drawer (or an unlocked drawer if your disguise skills are top notch).
Or just memorize a base of 8-10 random characters (it isn't too hard, memorize more if you want) and add another character or two before or after it according to some simple rule you think up connecting the website to the extension. Bitcoin password would be bitxxxxxxxx, facebook would be facexxxxxxxx. Or put it in the middle or the end. Whatever.

Well, that's self-selecting. Scams are naturally less prevalent in ecosystems that have the ability to chargeback. If you're running a scam you will realize zero profit, because everyone will chargeback (scammers have to be more creative).
With Bitcoin, you can just act like a responsible dude, convince a few people that you're legit, more people want to get in on the deal (it's easy to scam people with something too good to be true) and when the orders jump, you run off with the money.
Modern currency has eliminated simple scams with chargebacks. Bitcoin hasn't.

The problem isn't that our economy runs on US dollars. The problem is that physical cards and merchant databases have CC numbers stored on them.

How so? Those businesses only work because of regulation, the bane of Bitcoin. Coinbase (or any other Bitcoin bank) could declare bankruptcy, disappear with your money and you're shit out of luck.
All of the benefits of credit cards will be gone. Chargebacks can't work with Bitcoin. They'd require your financial information if you wish to open a line of credit, they're not just going to loan anyone money and hope you pay it back (so much for being anonymous).
Fraud and scams will run rampant without regulation. Eventually you'll all realize this, haphazardly implement changes, and find out you just reinvented modern currency, while experiencing every single growing pain along the way.
And even if digital currency does take off someday, it *definitely* won't be in the form of Bitcoin.

Cold war had just ended, capitalism was booming, gas was cheap, unemployment was low, wages were decent enough to live off of, technology was starting to revolutionize our world, cell phones, digital TV, the internet. Life was good, people were happy.

You can still do this. Go down to the bank and purchase a safe deposit box. Put all of your cash in it. Done. The bank will store your money in the vault and it will be there whenever you need it.
Of course there's a downside: you have to pay a monthly fee for the box, but that's because you won't let the bank reinvest the money (and they have to make money somehow). For the general consumer, it's cheaper and easier to store your money for free by letting the bank reinvest your money. The chance of the bank collapsing is insanely low and the FDIC has you covered anyway. But if you're okay with spending a monthly fee to satiate your paranoia, then go ahead.

You shouldn't be writing checks for amounts larger than what's in your bank account. It doesn't matter what order the bank processes them in, because there should always be enough money in your account.
You know those ledger lines in your checkbook? Right above the checks? Those are so *you* can keep track of your account balance. When you write a check, you subtract it's amount from your balance, keeping a running total of what you have left to spend.
You're an adult. It's not the bank's job to keep track of how you spend your money. If you write a check that you don't have enough money for, the bank is going to give that money to whom it is owed, and come after *you* (the fool who can't keep track of his money) for the difference plus fees.
Some banks are nice and have things like overdraft protection and just refusing to pay out if you don't have the money. These are *additional services* and not required by a bank (if you read your contract).


And then what? Do you instead want to get served a small claims court summons from the business you owe money to?

The sheer volume of transactions Dell does makes any fraud insignificant.
Anyway, it doesn't matter, merchants don't choose the currency, consumers do. If your store only accepts wampum, consumers will shop somewhere else. If your store doesn't take PayPal or credit cards, consumers will shop somewhere else that lets them chargeback. Businesses must entice the consumer, not the other way around.
Is a 10% discount (and I agree that number is just a marketing ploy, standard rates would just be 2-5% off fiat prices) enough to persuade customers to lose the ability to chargeback and instead figure out a currency that is hard to understand and set up for someone not familiar with technology or computers? I don't think so. Someday additional security platforms may be built on top of Bitcoin, but then you've just made an inefficient replica of current payment processors.

A nation has the right to secure its borders. Border control doesn't need probable cause to search you or your things.

So anything over $10,000 requires you to file a form with proof of how you got it.

You need to use something that measures the value of what's being produced like [GDP]( The number or volume of transactions isn't useful. Money changes hands internally in companies all the time, and people move their personal stash of Bitcoins around as well. But comparing the value of goods and services produced (and in theory sold with Bitcoin) from year to year shows if the economy is growing or shrinking. 
Of course this would require a central agency that collects businesses' Bitcoin income and expenses. Unless you wanted to do some sort of self-reporting mechanism (which wouldn't be very accurate). It's easy for modern nations to measure because you have to report it all for taxes anyway, but Bitcoin lacks that, and thus is hard to measure.

Most, nay, the majority of Bitcoin users are not from Cyprus. Any first-world bank is pretty damn safe.
The Germany article is about $141 billion in gold with the Federal Reserve. This isn't even the same thing as a checking/savings account at a bank, but nevertheless if I had $141 billion in a bank (which is stupid because the insured amount is only $250,000) I would expect it to take some time to withdraw all that. We're discussing personal bank accounts anyway, not governments trading gold (which plays by different rules).


Do banks even charge fees for checking/savings account? They make all their money reinvesting your money (and savings account even make measurable interest for me). You could be talking about banks tacking on suspicious fees (which should be listed on your statement, call them up and raise hell if you disagree with them), but unless my balance goes down, the bank hasn't stolen any money.

Otherwise some huge company will mass produce his invention for cheap because they don't have any investment costs. They just copied his idea.

First off none of those have progressed further than maybe the 1800s technology wise. There are less than 100,000 San people. Pygmies seem to be in small groups as well. Aborigines seem to have integrated into modern society.
I'm sure in the 18th and 19th centuries those forms of society were valid and successful. But you'll notice that any contemporary attempt at anarchy fails. Modern society cannot function in an anarchical way wtih modern technology and everything it enables. Definitely not on any large scale.

Most people investing in Bitcoin aren't in a fucking third-world country though. Take the US, where banks are literally the safest place you could ever store money (and the safest investment is probably Treasury bonds). It's insured by the FDIC to over $200,000. So your bank could be robbed, burn down, and go bankrupt in one day, and you'll still have your money.
And if the US government collapses? Well, you'll have bigger problems to deal with than recuperating whatever was stored in your savings account.

It says they have some left from 2011, so I don't think it looks good for 2013 and 2014 unless they managed to stop that downward trend. Also look at that credit rating. The only reason they can borrow money is because everyone knows when the federal government says they will pay you back, they *will* pay you back. Government debt is the safest investment in the world. An independent nation that has a deficit from inception and taxes mainly coming from wealthy people (who are quick to vacate at the first sign of trouble) doesn't sound like a safe investment.


I'm thinking about things like interstates, medicare, medicaid, social security. All of that is now shouldered by the independent nation, one that has to set up all of the infrastructure necessary to support these things before they can even pay for it. If no one loans them money, something will go unpaid, people get mad, and joining back with the union looks like a good idea.
Basically staying with the federal government has to become a really, really shitty deal before declaring independence actually looks like a good idea.

They're probably in a wait and see mode but also have the research and accounting divisions cooking up some ideas of what they can still make money off of. Western Union has a huge client base that probably won't jump ship all at once but gradually, and that's only if Bitcoin takes off. They will probably have time to see if there is a spot for them in the new paradigm or have plans for something else by then. If Bitcoin flops, then WU can just keep on chugging.

The government sells off lots of shit forfeited to them because it was used/stolen for criminal purposes and never claimed or bought with money obtained from criminal dealings.

You have a right to break away, but the government doesn't have to just sit back and watch. When they wrote the Declaration of Independence I don't think any of them were naive enough to think King George would just let his colonies leave. You're going to have to fight a war to prove your rights.
Presumably other states would be joining you or you'd have a foreign government's support. To break away because you're quality of life (which is already the pinnacle of the first-world), *could* be better is absurd (I'm pretty sure it would be worse). One doesn't secede because something minor upset you, secession is for grave attacks against your rights, like Jefferson listed off.
Revolutions are bloody, destructive wars that tear families apart, destroy people's lives and jobs, and throw a society into turmoil for a few years while the war plays out. They usually don't work (the colonists were pretty damn lucky), and shouldn't be attempted unless you have a *very* good reason like Jefferson did.

So to answer your question:


It depends who you ask. Are people resigning from the government to support California? Are masses of people vacating California because some revolutionary people are on a power trip? Everyone has to make their own decision as to whether "intolerable oppression" is occuring. Not accepting Bitcoin is not intolerable oppression. If the government is imprisoning you without a fair trial, that might be something to start a revolution about.

Jury nullification is an unfortunate side effect of our system. I think the jury system is still worth keeping due to all its advantages. And when clear jury nullification has taken place we have to accept the ruling for fear of undermining what the entire system is built on.


But we don't have to encourage it. In fact, if the defense attorney (or anyone else really) mentions nullification in front of the jury, they can be found in contempt of court/disbarred, because it skews the jury's purpose.

Scamming people out of their Bitcoins is a lot easier than robbing a bank, though. So self-interest should lead thieves to stealing Bitcoins.
Basically, everything you listed is a calculated risk. The self-interest of the other driver or food company in preserving their livelihood is what makes driving and buying a food a very low-risk activity. For the average consumer, storing your money at a FDIC-insured bank is low-risk. The chances of your money being lost/stolen with no recourse is insanely low. It's the same with credit cards and PayPal. Those companies rely on the goodwill of consumers and would quickly get shutdown if they started scamming people. With Bitcoin (remember I'm talking average consumer with *average* skillset), ehh.... it's pretty risky. No consumer protections doesn't bode very well.

Bitcoiners have this weird idea in their heads that if they create a system that is slightly cheaper than the current one, then existing businesses will just collapse. Western Union is not stupid.

I think you're hugely overestimating the amount of fraud a typical business gets. And how do they really know if it's fraud? Do they personally hand-deliver all of their purchases? Businesses should be building lost merchandise into their profit margin. Not every single unit is going to be properly sold and profited on. Some will be damaged en route, some will get lost in the mail, and some will arrive fine but the customer fraudulently chargebacks. Nothing you can really do, it's just part of running a business.
Not to mention the business has to cater to the consumer. *Consumers* like protections and chargebacks. PayPal may fuck over some businesses, but to the consumer it's one of the best things on the internet: a reputable middle-man that let's them buy anything anywhere securely. I don't think it's going away anytime soon.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:42:25
Yeah, but you have to look at it from the customer perspective. They don't care about your protection. You're just a business, providing them with a service/goods. If they pay you money and you don't send the goods, they need a way to get their money back. Paypal lets them contest it, credit cards let them chargeback, and so on.
That's why those payment methods are so popular. They protect the consumer. Bitcoin doesn't. You send money, it's gone. There's only the goodwill of the company you sent it to to rely on. That's way too much trust necessary for the average consumer. The consumer chooses what payment methods are acceptable to them. You, as a business, have to cater to the consumer. If the consumer doesn't like the fact that there's no protection for them in Bitcoin, and that's all you accept, they're going to take their business elsewhere.
Not to mention how complicated it is to set up Bitcoin and transfer USD. I personally think you're alienating a large part of your customer base, on the idealistic assumption that it will help support some "digital currency" (which is likely doomed to fail as a currency).

In the 19th and most of the 20th century, you'd be hard-pressed to find a jury in the South (usually made up entirely of white people) willing to convict a white person of crimes against a black, despite insurmountable evidence. *That* is jury nullification. Those jurors probably thought they knew what the law should be too.
Juries are not empowered to determine what is wrong and what is right. They are only finders of fact. They evaluate the evidence and decide whether it meets the criteria specified by law. *Not* whatever they personally think the law should be.
If you don't like the law there are legislative avenues to have it changed. Juries are not supposed to let their emotions or desires influence their decision. Jury nullification sounds romantic and allows you fight your own little battle against the man, but really it's a slippery slope.
You've already made up your mind as to whether the accused is guilty or innocent without seeing any evidence. That's one small step away from vigilantism if you ask me.

Yes, but freeing yourself from government and regulation means no oversight. There is only the movement of the market and the purchasing power of consumers to persuade companies to act in a "right" manner. It doesn't look like its working with Bitcoin. Ghash was acquiring more and more of the market, and everyone was saying "miners will move to other pools," but they didn't because consumers like money and ghash is providing the money.
Unless your economic system flawlessly aligns greedy company interests with the community of consumer's interests (basically an impossible feat), then those greedy companies will exploit every single loophole in the system they can find to maximise profits. Capitalism creates ugly things like monopolies, fraud, and companies skimping on product safety and employee safety protections to generate the most profit possible. The government remedies this with regulations and oversight. If the company wants to make a profit at all, they will follow the rules society has created and that are enforced by an encompassing body (the government). We started with an imperfect system and patch the holes that companies exploit as they find them. It works fairly well (as you can see by the US GDP).
Bitcoin disallows an overhead regulating body, creates a protocol for transactions, basically says "this is how transactions work, nothing but the free market controls", and sits back to see if it works. A novel idea, but one that seems more doomed every day. When loopholes are found: mining companies consolidating control of the hashing power, scammers running free, inability to regain stolen money, and so on, it becomes difficult to impossible to patch those holes without compromising the entire point of why you started the currency.

Maybe you're using a different definition of freedom than me, but I'd say national currencies' abilities to buy pretty much everything within their borders gives citizens a lot more freedom than a digital currency that is barely accepted by anyone.
An analogy would be using Confederate dollars in the north during the civil war. You may believe it's going to be the currency of the future and some merchants might accept your confederate dollars, but it definitely isn't useful to buy pretty much anything.
Unless you were just talking about buying illegal drugs or hitmen, in which case, yes Bitcoin does give you more "freedom" (whatever that means) than other currencies.
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:33:33
If we had one national bank, then yes I would agree that it shouldn't fail, but we don't. Banks are just businesses subject to a lot of regulation. Depositors let banks invest their money elsewhere in return for keeping it safe. Banks use it to give loans to other people or put it on the stock market or whatever.
Some banks are not very good at giving out loans, or suck at the stock market, and they fail. Not very often, but they're a business, and businesses fail. This was a problem in 1929, the government realized that, and created the FDIC to remedy the problem. The turnaround isn't a problem, your bank fails, the FDIC usurps all of the accounts, and cuts each of the depositors a check for the money owed.

To the average consumer, credit cards have no oustanding flaws. They still work fine. Sure Bitcoin technically has some advantages, but none of them appeal to the average consumer who has everything they need in a payment system already. Mainstream consumers don't care about fractional reserve banking or identity theft or chargebacks or corrupt bankers making money off of them.

What did Facebook and Twitter have? A unique idea that filled a hole in the market that people didn't even know existed, combined with a slick user interface.
What does Bitcoin have? A unique idea, sure, but it really isn't providing anything. People (read: mainstream consumers) already have a currency that works for them, and a low-cost, fast, and easy way to buy things online. And Bitcoin's user interface: non-existant/godawful.
It's kind of like [this xkcd comic]( Everyone already has a currency that works for them. Bitcoin's technology includes new use cases, but those were fringe to begin with. Nobody (read: no mainstream consumers) needs them.

I think you guys are forgetting something important too. Unless you are the only person that has whatever the hackers are looking for, you'll be fine. They go for the low hanging fruit, not the passwords that take 1000 days or even 100 days to crack. They probably just take the list of 1000 most common passwords, plug that into every financial website they can find, and rake in the dough.
If you have a moderately decent password (say a base of eight random alphanumeric characters and change one or two between websites), you're most likely fine. Your security questions in case you forget the password are probably easier to crack (mom's maiden name? you're doing it wrong).
Or use a currency that lets you get your money back in the event of theft.
@_date: 2014-10-26 15:36:29
That's a skewed definition of best. A currency is defined by its usefulness, and I sure as hell can't buy gas, or food, or pay the rent with Bitcoin. You can name random stats, and I can name things like user adoption, volatility, ease of use, and storage security that would get Bitcoin laughed out of the room in the face of fiat currencies.

Now that's a load of bull. You guys have fucking log charts and rainbow graphs with lines drawn everywhere predicting everything under the sun, so I don't think you can really tell anyone off for "misrepresenting information." If anything, the "trolls" are the ones reminding newbs that no, Bitcoin is not guranteed to go up, it is still volatile, its inflation puts third-world countries to shame, and that you can spend it pretty much nowhere. If you do find a place to spend it, Fiat -&gt; Exchange -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; Processor -&gt; Fiat is never going to be better than just using fiat. You just paid a fee to hold some internet tokens (that probably dropped in value) for a bit (pun not intended).

[From Wikipedia:](


Also, check out the [Freedom in the World]( survey. China has a score of 7 for political rights and 6 for civil liberties (quite bad) and is labeled "Not free". The US has a 1 in both categories and is labeled "Free." Or pick whatever other poll/study you want; China is going to rank way below the US every time.

Just a technicality:


This is only true for debts. If I owe you $1000, I can pay you in pennies and you'll have to take all 100,000 of them off my hands. When purchasing something from a merchant, there is no debt involved. You can always walk away. Similarly the merchant can restrict what you can pay him with. You see this a lot in gas stations and small stores that refuse to accept 50s or 100s because they don't have enough cash on hand to make change.
So, if a merchant wants to accept only Bitcoin for purchases (a supremely retarded idea), then it's their right to do so. They could also only accept beaver skins or wampum. Not the smartest business move, but legal none the less.

If you don't like that survey, pick a different one. They'll all tell you the same thing. Every survey/study has biases but it's not like the US and China are neck and neck. One is always way farther up the chart than the other. You can't find one neutral study that actually says China has more freedom than the US.

If it's an in-person transaction then you can use cash, which doesn't require a fee to convert in and out of, and can be used *literally* anywhere. If you don't have cash, then that's the point of a credit card: you don't have to pay the bill until later.

Ain't that the sticking point. The problem is, those governments backing currencies are what make them stable, useful, and encouraging to economic growth. Bitcoin is at the whim of the free market. You might think that is good, but 40 years of economic depression because your currency is wont to do that and no one's allowed to fix it is not considered good by most people.

I think you forgot one common criticism: Bitcoin's security is shit. Newcomers have to know pretty much everything about digital security if they have any hope of storing them securely. Too much effort for mainstream consumers. Even veteran Bitcoiners get burned (and then post their sob story on begging the hacker to return it). It's never going to take off in its current form. I guess you could implement some third-party software to store them securely, but now you're just reinventing the modern banking system on a 100-year lag with none of the advantages that the current system has.
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:36:58
You forgot a key point. A currency is only as valuable as society deems it. A dollar bill is just a piece of paper, nothing more, nothing less. It's what we as a society assign it that gives it value. The United States backs it and businesses accept it in exchange for goods and services.
Bitcoin is similarly just some numbers in a database. Pretty useless if you don't have electricity. Also pretty useless if you can't spend it anywhere. I can't buy my groceries or get a haircut with Bitcoins, so please don't fault me for using USD. Society may deem Bitcoins worthless as a form of currency (as it mostly does right now), and then it's back to just some lines of code.
But, hey, speculation isn't all bad. Bitcoins may be the way of the future. I just wouldn't put all of my capital into it right now. It's essentially a stock.
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:27:04
Banks are even pretty good at securing digital information. I'm pretty sure their servers are better protected than whatever you have at home. Millions of people use them everyday, it's not like our bank accounts have money stolen from them regularly.
Unless you're up to something shady, and you consider the IRS, FBI, and federal banking organizations investigating your spending habits as a reason to not "trust them with your money." In that case, yeah, if you're buying drugs online or committing tax fraud Bitcoin might be safer than a bank.
The only other thing I can think of is you just don't want the government to be able to look over your shoulder (even when you've done nothing wrong)? Well, that's fair enough, but most of the country is quite alright with the way it is. We don't *have* a problem with the current system. By all means, switch to your new currency if you like the additional privacy, but realize it's never going to go mainstream the way it's set up now. For most people, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

It's definitely not "tragically funny" that people don't know how our currency is manipulated by the government or the intricacies of how bank funds are transferred or how "most of our money already is digital". We don't fucking care. It *works*. I can use it to *buy things*.
 In the grand scheme of things fiat is pretty useful. The general public is not crying out for a new currency to save them from the horrors of fiat. So don't be surprised when they take no interest in something that isn't quite relevant yet.

Wrong actually. Assume 65 adults arrested. Only 40 cases are accepted for prosecution (that's 38% dropped cases right there). 10 of those jump bail or abscond ( that's 15% probably guilty, but not punished). The other 30 go to trial. 27 of those plead guilty (because, they probably were in fact guilty). Only 1 (1.5%) is acquitted (because most people who are actually innocent aren't actually prosecuted). 2 (3%) are found guilty by the jury.That's 29 out of 65 sentenced. 8 (12%) are put on probation and 21 (32%) are incarcerated.

Except in a deflationary currency, your money gains purchasing power just sitting around.

It's been five years now, bud, and the Bitcoin economy is still nonexistant. Just keep waiting I guess...

Transfer fees? It costs money to send your money to someone else, so the discount is really just offsetting that and we're back to square one.
With credit cards the cost is obfuscated via the vendor. With Bitcoin it's "Wait, I have to extra money just to buy something? Fuck this."
 And you're also assuming a lot of generosity on the part of vendors, exchanges, and processsors. Greed is a much more prevalent thing in Bitcoin due to the lack of regulation, and as you attain more and more of the market, and become more established you can increase that payment processing fee.
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:25:41
He sounds more like "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." Credit cards are doing just fine. Bitcoin is a stunted fringe internet currency for the time being. Visa is a giant. It won't go out of business if Bitcoin ever starts gaining market share. If anything, Visa has the knowledge and capital to play hardball: increase rewards, reduce merchant fees.

Most businesses should be able to build this into their pricing model. If your margins are so thin that a couple of fraudulent charges significantly changes your profit, then maybe you need to re-evaluate your pricing. Also if the scammers are caught, the merchant can sue for the money equivalent.
Objectively, Bitcoin eliminates the fraudulent chargeback problem. But for most businesses (and really any successful business) this isn't a problem. They have accepted it and found a way to deal with it. And so far Bitcoin's negatives have outweighed this one small (to them) positive.

Until Bitcoin supports these things, I don't think it's going to grow or go anywhere really.


And consumers get to choose where to shop and what currency to use. Why switch to something that offers *less* protection. Are the advantages of Bitcoin so numerous that it's worth losing the ability to chargeback? I think most people would say no.
Right now you have a niche market for tech geeks who like playing with technology and are willing to pay exchange fees and processing fees, and lose the consumer protections. Your currency is stuck from going mainstream because mainstream consumers can't deal with these things (living almost paycheck to paycheck, fraudulent vendors would destroy your financial standing).

That's only the result of your own stupidity if you overdraw. Checkbooks exist for a reason.


Yeah, that's the terms of the contract, so again, it's your own fault. Also, I don't believe that many people have a problem with this (I've never been told I'm withdrawing too many times).


Not common at all for mainstream consumers, and it's not like it's unfair. The bank offers a service and it costs money. Sure, Bitcoin is an alternative, but it still has a 1% fee on both ends (although I agree Bitcoin has potential in the remittance market). 


Aren't you paying the same prices with your Bitcoin? I don't see any discounts out there. Thanks for subsidizing my debit card, I guess.


That's okay, I didn't put money in my savings account to make interest off of it, I put it in there I have immediate access while keeping it safe.
Also, 0% interest is better than the negative interest that Bitcoin seems to be accruing every day.
Look at what else I get for free:
* Security - bank is insured against theft
* FDIC - my money is safe if the bank goes under (sure it's funded by tax dollars, but you're paying taxes too)
* Fraud protection
* Ability to reverse transactions

The FDIC was created for a good reason. People making an honest living who want to store their savings securely shouldn't have to gamble on whether a bank will fail or not. People distrusted banks enough as it was. The creation of the FDIC did a lot towards repairing that trust (because storing money under your mattress is a patently bad idea). Now account holders aren't liable for whatever risky investments the bank takes on. 
I don't think banks should be kept from failing though. If a bank can't process withdrawals, the FDIC takes over, covers all accounts, and dissolves the bank. Account holders have their money and can pick a different bank. Of course, in 2008 they did bail the banks out. Those were really big banks that had ties to numerous parts of the economy, and bankruptcy would have repercussions everywhere. I don't have a PhD in economics, so I'm not going to attempt to make blanket statements on whether that was the correct decision or not.

That's what I'm thinking too. Western Union can charge exorbitant fees because they're near monopoly status. If you make the market competitive, that doesn't mean WU just quits. They can play hardball too. With the hundreds of years of experience they have in this market, they know exactly how to shave costs and streamline their process to remain competitive, plus the huge existing client base. Bitcoin companies who are new to the market have to entice clients (which costs money) without going bankrupt.
It's the same with credit cards. If Bitcoin starts grabbing market share, the credit cards will just drop their fees to remain competitive. It's going to be an uphill battle for Bitcoin the whole way.

I have paid fees for 3rd party ATMs but when I withdraw from it, it says "There will be a $3 surcharge. Is this okay?" and I'm okay with that. It's the cost of accessibility and isn't really a "fee" so much as a service provided by someone other than your bank. I have never actually paid any fees to my actual bank. If you find a bank that covers 3rd party ATMs for you, then awesome, that's a nice bonus.

Without banks, the only place to store your money is under your mattress (where it can be easily stolen).
Banks let you store your money in a secure location. They're also insured (FDIC and whatnot), in case the bank goes bankrupt, is robbed, or destroyed. If the money under your mattress is stolen, lost, or destroyed you are shit out of luck.
Banks also provide other services, like safe deposit boxes (for storing physical goods) and loans.

I never said it was a good return. The war had to be fought. The World Wars were not optional. The Cold War not so much but that's just the way international politics work. We didn't get a good return, but we got a return. Yes, if all the war money had gone into the economy the economy would be better, but that's never going to happen. The money had to be spent on war, which boosts the economy but not as much as if it had gone straight to the economy. And that is the answer to his question: war is good for the economy.

It's funny that [quality of life]( correlates pretty closely with [developed countries]( which (surprise, surprise) all have governments. It's also interesting to note that those countries with no or ineffectual governments have some of the lowest quality of life in the world.
I also submit as evidence everything in [this article]( Notice that none of those exist anymore (except maybe Somalia, but I hope that's not your posterboy for showing how governments are bad). All of them were replaced by *governments* by the people.
Your berry example shows that yes, innovation is good. We started farming, settled down, and *created governments*. The first government created being a resounding success is the reason they are so prevalent today. It works.
By all means, start your anarcho-capitalist society or plain old anarchy or whatever. I think it will fail. I may be wrong, I may be right. Who knows? I'm just saying you have zero data points to support your side and I have near 100 data points supporting my side (and negating your side).
Making snide remarks on the internet about how sucky our government is is not the way to push progress forward.

So I should exchange my money for an alternative currency (so that's a couple percent gone), then buy a *gift card* to where I actually want to spend my money, and use a gift card to buy the product? That's a lot more complicated then hitting one button on Amazon *and* I have to pay an exchange more money to even get the alternative currency?


I'm not going to profess to totally understand what these things are, but I assume they hold your money until the vendor delivers the goods, and then pass it on to the vendor? Wouldn't they charge a fee to provide this service? How is this an improvement on consumer protections we have in fiat?
We still have:
* "Can I pay my bills with it?"
* "Does it even hold a consistent value over a period longer than a week?"

Rare and credit card covers all losses and sends you a new card instantly. Bitcoin theft on the other hand...


Still haven't seen these "cheaper products." Credit cards have at least 3% rewards which negates any price markup. Losses due to fraud? That's a calculated business risk. Should be built in and a negligible part of revenue.

Might be price gouging and they sort of have a monopoly, but credit cards are massive operations, requiring huge datacenters. There's a lot of overhead there that needs to be accounted for in maintaning all of that. If Bitcoin transactions ever scaled up to the size of fiat (haha), those rates will probably increase to be comparable to credit card ones, if not more.
Credit card companies are established, have been plying their trade for a while, and know what they're doing. If they wanted to be competitive, they could probably be competitive. Coinbase would be at the limits of their capacity and new to the business of managing a huge corporation. And after all they're a business, why would they be more generous than they have too. If you were one of the leading Bitcoin payment processors and had brand recognition, why wouldn't you up that percent a bit. People will pay it.

Except every single one of those (or the vast majority of) revolutions instituted a better form of government. Every time a nation descended into anarchy, it was chaotic and clearly worse off for pretty much everyone. It was always resolved by creating a government. There are close to 200 different governments across the world. That's 200 different groups of people that decided instituting a government was the best way to do things. There isn't one example of a peaceful sizable group of anarchists.
I understand where you're coming from with everything listed in that paragraph. Those things would all be great, but it just isn't possible. Anarchy always descends into chaos. I guess if you like chaos and the survival of the fittest then that's great. But most people don't. It's like how some form of communism/socialism is regarded by most scholars as the best form of government, but it doesn't work practically at all because humans are corrupted and someone always takes power. Democracy+capitalism is the best alternative we can come up with. And it works pretty well.

Why does that have to be a problem? As long as it's relatively slow and steady, there's really no harm. It motivates investment and drives the economy.

I don't think anybody 200 years ago was stockpiling money in the hopes of spending it around the turn of the millennium. Inflation drives the economy. It's not difficult to beat inflation. Your piss-poor deflationary economy that barely exists is full of people hoarding internet tokens. Great economy. That's what deflationary economies do. Stagnate. Nobody wants to invest their money.
Unfortunately you won't get to see the true effects, because Bitcoin won't be deflationary for 100 years (fantastic job with that by the way). In the meantime it's more inflationary than just about everything else, which means people sell it off whenever they get a good deal, and it descends further into obscurity.
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:52:30

Like 99% of the time? Credit card companies are incredibly lenient. They want you to continue being a customer paying that minimum payment for the next 40 years. You'd have to fuck up pretty bad to have the CC company not reverse the charges.


This just isn't as prevalent as this sub makes it out to be. Usually the credit card company can help clean that up too (or whoever lost your identity).


You have to remember this is the extent of people's ability to secure anything.


This is already too much effort for average Joe. He just wants something that works. He already has to remember a password for work. Don't make him make another one and backup shit (who the fuck wants to spend 4 hours figuring out how to that?).


Oh it costs $120 to secure my money? And that's better than my *free* bank account? And I have to spend countless hours figuring out how it works? Sign me up...


This is just ridiculous. Your average person understands like one word in that phrase.




Is that like my HD TV?


Hahaha. Be realistic dude. It's nigh impossible to be completely free from malware, especially from the way some people trawl the internet these days. Especially in the hypothetical scenario where 99% of people store all their money on their hard drive. You think malware makers aren't going to jump on that?


So, we're back to centralized storage? That's at least a little more sane, but I'm not sure how this internet "exchange" has any improvements on the inherent low-riskness of a bank account.


Live in fear? lol


Not sure what your point is. If we're still talking about CCs, then it's not my money, I'm borrowing it from the CC company for a month. As for a debit card, 99% of my purchases are made in the local area which isn't going to trigger a fraud alert, and a 5-minute phone call when I go on vacation is well worth it so some dude in China doesn't empty my bank account.
I.E. THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT. Me and any average person sucks balls at security. This bank actually knows how security works. And is offering me a free bank account. And using the money is still seamless. Why do you think 99% of mainstream consumers use debit and credit cards? BECAUSE IT WORKS.


Uh, what? Why would they not give me my money? Is the bank insolvent? FDIC resolves that. Am I suspected of a crime? I don't think that happens on any regular basis to people outside of those who probably were involved in criminal activity. Otherwise a phone call or visit to the bank should clear it up.
If you don't like the way one bank treats you, just find a new one. It's not like there's only one option.

2-3% CC rewards + 1% fee to buy Bitcoins leaves only about a 1% discount. Is that worth it? Also you lose the ability to chargeback. I've never heard of "hairlosstalk.com" and have no idea of their reputability, but the ability to chargeback is worth more than 1% off to me.

Switzerland isn't a continent-spanning country with the largest GDP in the world and a large multicultural population that is at the forefront of technological innovation and a cultural trendsetter. We were more or less forced into the role of world police, because our country touches every part of the globe.
You could say the same thing about the British Empire two or three hundred years ago. Every empire has skeletons in their closet. To blame Americans for paying taxes that "support" bombing and torturing is nonsensical. I am not a master of international relations. I can't tell you which wars are justified and which aren't and I'm sure it's all blurry and grey anyway, but the simple fact is, Switzerland was never dealt these cards. They never had to make a tough decision about whether to invade a country halfway across the world.

Not really, no. A jury is not tasked with making the laws or deciding to whom/when they apply. They only evaluate the evidence and apply that to the criteria set by the law. No more, no less. Jury nullification is just an unfortunate side-effect of our justice system: juries can't be punished for a 'wrong' decision, and a not-guilty defendant can't be tried again for the same crime.
OP never mentioned what the trial was about or why he decided to take the law into his own hands. Jury nullification was rampant in the south before the civil rights movement. White juries would never convict a white of crimes against a black; blacks were most likely assumed guilty. That's presuming they even got a trial; half the time they just went and lynched them (and a jury would never convict the lynch mob of murder).
If you support jury nullification, you might as well just throw *the entire fucking legislative branch* out the window. Because you prefer letting 12 people play God instead, each of them with their own idea of what's wrong and what's right. Have fun.

A solution to a problem that 99% of the world doesn't have. Unless you improve and simplify pretty much every aspect of Bitcoin, it's never going to see mainstream adoption. The existing systems work pretty damn flawlessly for what 99% of the world does on a daily basis. Bitcoin's advantages appeal to niche libertarians and people paranoid of the dollar collapsing. Computers and the internet had real features, applications, and advantages that the vast majority of people could use and appreciate.

So you'd rather have a bill (x2) for your kids' education, another bill because you drove on somebody's road to get to work today, the electric company just raised their rates to exorbitant amounts because who else are you going to get electricity from (or alternatively, there's now six different sets of power line poles lining the roadways in the name of "competition")? Some dude robbed your house today, and that detective you were going to pay to look into it just asked for more money, so guess we'll just have to give up on ever getting that back.
Your sister's cut is now infected, because when you took her to the emergency room they refused to treat her without payment first, and you just spent your last bit of money on groceries, and payday isn't until next Friday.
Oh, the water bill is also due, but you're really pissed because it's been a funny brown color for the last month (all the neighbors say the same thing) and the water company doesn't seem to give a shit.
It's too bad you don't have that 5 acre field of corn you used to tend anymore, could really use the money from that. Ever since some rich guy and his mercenary pals with guns decided it was now his corn field and "what are you going to do about it", it just hasn't been the same.
Oh, and you got a new boss at work, but he immediately fired you because (and I quote) "I don't like black people."
Guess those two kids will have to start working cause we just can't afford school any more. Too bad the only place willing to hire them is the factory down the road (the one spewing out the smoke that seems to coat everything in this town) tanning leather for $1/hr. Guess it's for the best, since there's not much to do for fun in this town ever since the local fishing spot just has river banks lined with dead fish (wait, is that related to the factory and brown water? Doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it anyway).
But otherwise, life is good, because I'm not being robbed at gunpoint. Unless you count the cornfields, and the many times I've been mugged (detective and mercenary prices are just too damn high, and the muggers know it). Oh and that guy who charges $100/day to cross the only bridge leading to your (former) place of employment. That's not robbery though, just an honest business transaction. Hey, maybe I should get in the bridge business (pipe dream, I know, since the bridge guy has some friends who burn down anyone else's attempts to build a bridge. Oh and where am I going to get the money to build a bridge anyway? I spent the last 40 years saving up to buy this run-down house (plus cornfield no longer in my possession).)

1) There won't be bank runs. That's what the FDIC prevents. Banks go bankrupt individually because of their own stupidity and the government can easily refund the accounts at one bank. There would only be a bank run on every bank at the same time if the dollar is crashing, and since that is backed by the US economy, well... think of how catastrophic a scenario that would be.
2) Your Bitcoins would fair no better. With the aforementioned crashed US economy nobody is going to be buying much of anything, and your Bitcoins will be as worthless as they are now.

You've basically described 17th century stratified society. You are the wealthy elite who can afford the best, and the common rabble make do with the leftovers. The wealthy do what they want and the commoners have no one to address their grievances. They just get by. 95% of the population lives in relative poverty. Your birth determines your life. There is no way to advance up the social ladder.


Somebody has to have kids. You're not the only one in this scenario. And the scenario has to be good for pretty much everyone or it will always just be a fantasy in your mind.


Every road you've ever driven on is a toll road? And payments will be no more expensive than a fuel tax?


Because both those things are affordable to most people. Especially in a scenario where we're nowhere close to the first-world economy.


Well, I guess it's good the thieves know that every house is up for pickins' now. Your solar panels and wind generator will probably be the first to go.




I guess I should have expected that. You'd let someone die at your feet if they couldn't pay the bill. Typical.


Just everyone else, right? Fuck you, I've got mine?


Cool, more stuff to steal. And stuff that's only been developed and made in first-world nations.


I don't know, you got all that cool equipment, and you can only snipe so fast. Good luck with that. Also, you going to spend every day for the rest of your life defending your property and boiling water? That sounds fun. You being military-trained also falls back into the elite category. This is why governments are formed. So we all don't have to be military-trained to keep our stuff safe.


Every job opening you see doesn't hire black people. Guess you're now poor like the rest of us...


And how do you suppose they do that, in between defending their lands and boiling water and acquiring food? Form a government perhaps...


Monopolies can easily form through natural or illegitimate means, and are demonstrably bad for consumers. Mr. Moneybags can buy all the bridges, or hell, he can buy the damn river (control it, more accurately) and charge you to cross it in whatever way you want.




I'm thinking most people would choose to pay taxes, when the alternative is Somalia. So by any reasonable definition taxes are better.


Haha. This happens all the time (cf. every revolution in history). You'll note that the successful revolutions usually result in a new form of government, not "hey let's all go home now so in a bit a new guy comes into power and we're back where we started."

Yeah, I'm not watching a 30 minute video about the banking system, because it's beside the point. Whether you agree or disagree with fiscal policy in America, if you borrow money, you have to pay it back. You voluntarily went to a bank and asked for money. No one forced you to sign a contract.
As for buying property outright, no middle class person is able to do that. They'd have to live in a shithole for 20 years before being able to save up enough money to buy an $80,000 house. It's easier to have a house now and pay that $80,000 loan plus interest off over the next 30 years. You may think differently, and that's fine. But play by the rules.
Also I'm curious where you live and how you've totally avoided banks and "counterfeit money."

Bank accounts aren't used to stay ahead of inflation. They're used as a secure wallet (via debit card) and for keeping a small emergency fund. Your daily funds don't stick around long enough to be affected by inflation and having immediate access to your emergency fund is well worth whatever small amount of inflation impacts it. Apples and oranges.

Banks do a lot more than just hold money. Those are genuine services the "blockchain" can't do (like give you a loan or hold physical goods). 


Bitcoin exchanges are still going to need physical security. Also in this hypothetical wonderland where "everyone is their own bank" you just make it easier to steal money. Walk into house -&gt; point gun at occupant -&gt; demand password -&gt; send bitcoins -&gt; move to island -&gt; practically unreversable. So I guess everyone also needs a gun because the only thing standing between an attacker and your bank account is yourself.


You somehow think a digital currency will negate the need for vaults and secure storage equipment?


At least the money-making process doesn't expel millions of pounds of CO2 in the name of mathematical security. And like I said before, they have other jobs as well besides processing transactions.

I don't think people are doubting the mathematical underpinnings of Bitcoin. And I don't think the majority of people interested in Bitcoin are only here to see if the code is solid. They want a functioning economy free from regulation or they want to get rich quick or they don't want to pay credit card fees. Bitcoin is still incredibly niche and nowhere near mainstream. It's been 5 years. Is popularity gonna pick up soon or will it be another 10 years or 20 or 100? That's what people are doubting. Bitcoin going mainstream doesn't seem very likely anymore despite however secure it might be.
So if you set out to create an incredibly inefficient mathematically secure and decentralized accounting ledger, congratulations, you mostly succeeded. If your goal was to have it support a functioning economy, well you've so far failed.

You can spin this right round and it still holds true. Lots of folks on here who wonder why the masses haven't dropped their credit cards and run to the nearest exchange to get some Bitcoin. Refusing to acknowledge a steady downtrend and clear faults beyond "It's going back up soon, guyz", "It's in the wiki" and whatnot.
Of course I don't think everyone involved with Bitcoin is stupid. Everyone's entitled to a hobby. If you like playing around with internet tokens then be my guest. But lots of posts/comments here are just stacked with the quotes above and more.

That's built in though. It should come as no surprise. Bitcoin just lost 80% of its purchasing power *in a year*. Why does that not bother you?
Inflation on a hundred year scale doesn't mean anything. Nobody holds dollars for decades as an investment. And bringing it up every time we talk inflation just makes you look ill-informed. Until you can address the fact that your currency dropped *80% in a year*, you can't complain about USD losing 1-2% a year.

I'm not an economist; I'm not going to claim I know what will happen. But there's a lot of smart people that work for the government who do know what they're doing, and I don't think anything truly catastrophic is going to happen. If something does, your Bitcoins will be just as worthless, since they won't feed you, or shelter you or protect you from marauding gangs anymore than my pieces of paper will.
If the system is broken to the point where lots of people have lost what they expect in their 1st-world life, they will demand a solution. And I'm sure the government will have one, and implement it. And life will go on. And it probably won't involve Bitcoins.

The Constitution protects only American citizens and those currently in the US. Guatanamo is mostly enemy combatants who aren't either of those, and so don't have a right to due process or anything else guaranteed in the Constitution (unless the US wants to give it to them). Since they also violated most of the rules of warfare, they lose the protection of most of the Geneva conventions as well. Which means they really are only owed basic human rights. I agree that those basic human rights have probably been violated at Guantanamo, but basic human rights are different from what's given in the Constitution.

Sorry to smash your 14-year old beliefs but Bitcoin will not end poverty or "endless wars." Bitcoin already has more wealth inequality than most fiat systems. Also, I'm pretty sure economists agree that small, regulated inflation leads to a healthy economy that encourages people to spend and invest their money (which, you know drives all that innovation of the 21st century). US dollars have been increasing in value against pretty much every other currency and asset all year.
But please, keep ranting about fiat currency while most likely enjoying the benefits of an economy based on one.
