You don’t get it, it’s not about the solution, it’s only about trust. Nothing else. Bitcoin can’t be in a bubble, it’s basicly priceless. I’m not joking either.

Haha, bloody grateful instead. Thanks for this taste of my own medicine! ;)

Well, long time lurker here. But this as good a first post as any ;) 
What I'm doing on birthdays is: "Gimme your phone and a piece of paper" then I install a wallet on their smartphone, write down the back-up pass phrase and send them 0.1 BTC instantly from my own phone wallet. I then tell them to read up on it and spend it on whatever. 
Works every time, no negative experiences so far and I've been doing this for more than a year. Back to lurking now :P

They only **witness**, so what's the problem? 7 out of 12 would have to collude, comparable to a 51% attack in Bitcoin. Only much harder to convince Julian Assange, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Xi Jinping, Melinda Gates, Demis Hassabis and Tuur Demeester to collude than it is to get a bunch of miners reach 51% hash rate, wouldn't you say?
So let's just agree that no cryptocurrency is 100% trustless then.

Byteball is DAG based, read [this Medium article]( for a short explanation.
The benefits in short: Byteball has a user friendly wallet, it’s fast, has no PoW/PoS yet is still 100% trustless, very active development, extremely strong privacy through Blackbytes, human readable smart contracts that actually work already (insurance, prediction market, lottery, betting bot, blackbytes exchange, altcoin exchange, etc.), a fair distribution, and a limited supply.

Haha  :)
You are right, I was talking about the desired situation in the future. At the moment they are still run by tonych.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:34:56
Byteball Jesus, our saviour! Amen.

OK, so it's not 100% trustless, I will stop saying that, but neither is any other cryptocurrency then. 
12 seems like a low number but a witness in the Byteball system ideally is not just a single person but someone who represents a big business or institution with a lot of real world value. Let's take Jeff Bezos as an example. He has so much to lose in the real world that it would be very hard to persuade him to collude with 6 other very high profile people of high market cap companies/high profile institutions across the globe. Let alone, abduct and torture 7 of them before anyone finds out and can replace them.
All the assets of a witness in the real world, its entire reputation, all that is a security bond, not just what it has or what it earns in the internal economy.  This makes the witnesses anchors to the real world.
From a game theoretic point of view I would argue that a 12 witness system like this is actually more secure than a PoW based one. If you up the number of witnesses it will be much harder for users to know and recognise them all so they would just go with the "default" and not care about it much. So you have to have a number that is both safe and practical, 12 seems to fit the job. This number is large enough to protect against occasional failures but is not too large so that users can still know every witness.  
And we want the witnesses to be accountable, that’s why there is a way to replace them.  The way it works is that every user, with every transaction, posts a list of 12 witnesses he trusts.  But we won’t have consensus if the lists posted by different users are too far apart.  That’s why the lists of neighboring transactions on the DAG must differ by no more than one position.
The fact that witnesses can be replaced is another difference with miners.  The witnesses are accountable.  If a witness loses trust of users, users immediately signal their mistrust by changing their witness lists.
What miners do, they look at your transactions and decide, “I like this transaction and will include it, or I don’t like this transaction and won’t include it”.  With witnesses, it is the reverse.  It is users who look for witnesses to determine the consensus order of transactions.  **Witnesses don’t decide anything about individual transactions.  They are expected just to be there.**
What we do know from 9 years of Bitcoin / PoW though is this:
* Miners are gatekeepers; they have the power to include or not include your transaction. So the access to the ledger is not quite free, you have to meet the miners’ criteria for your transaction to be included in the next block.
* Miners are not accountable; they are supposed to make money, period.
* Fee market is an uncertainty; When the blocks are full, there is competition to get into the next block. Paying a higher fee supposedly increases your chances to get into the block.  But a payment system which is supposed to be used in everyday business, is not a game of chance, there must be guarantees that once you send a transaction according to all the rules, which is properly signed, spends existing money, and is not a double-spend, after you send it, you can immediately disconnect and still be confident that it goes through.  In blockchains, when the blocks are full, there is no certainty, no guarantees, no such thing as the right fee.
* Trade-off between security and cost;  block reward is supposed to be reduced over time and eventually go to 0. This means that miner incentives from block reward will decrease and they should be replaced by fees.  Which means that the system is as secure as the total amount of fees paid, and there is an uncomfortable trade-off between security and cost.
* Negative balance of resources; miners burn energy and have to pay to energy companies, outside the ecosystem.  Which means that the balance between resources flowing in and out of the ecosystem is negative.
* Outside incentives are ignored; lastly, miner incentives are only inside the ecosystem.  They make more money by mining honestly than by doublespending Bitcoins, that’s true under assumption that all their incentives are inside Bitcoin.  If we forget about the outside world, as if it doesn’t exist.  But in reality, outside incentives do exist.  Even more, if there are other tokens issued on the same ledger, as it is the case on Ethereum, the block reward is still in the native currency only but now this should be balanced against doublespending not only the native currency but the other tokens too. If the tokens are worth more than the native currency, the system becomes insecure.
So it does make sense to try out other consensus mechanisms. I really **like** Bitcoin a lot, but I **love** Byteball for trying something new.

I know it's much more complicated but to dismiss the witness system as "nothing" is also oversimplifying things. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:09:14
You don't recall correctly, there is no PoW in Byteball. Again, read [this article]( please.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:49:02
I think almost everyone agrees on that. They just recently hired a marketing &amp; PR director though, so there’s hope that this is actually going to change now. All of the focus has been on development so far, not marketing.

You couldn't be much further from the truth. Check [this page]( for a comparison between IOTA and Byteball. Byteball has a fully working product and is almost ready to be an ICO platform. IOTA, well ...
Zero confidence seems to be a bit short sighted, but I agree that none of them have been brutally battle tested like Bitcoin, so we'll just have to wait and see.

I try to explain it in the link I posted, [again for convenience](

Haha, loved your americanpegasus posts! Thought you just vanished like most people from back then.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:36:51
Let's agree to disagree then. I think it's much easier to do a 51% attack than to abduct and torture 7 people / businesses before you can replace them.
