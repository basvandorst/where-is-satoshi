Exactly. So the analogy isn’t a good one
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:55:04
Coincidentally, C+ is also the average grade for bitcoin investors. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:01:28
That is why I said this was another reason it will likely end up at 0. Not "the" reason.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:01:48
Yeah, this guy really nailed stumbling through a statement that amounted to him saying that he "thinks" Buffet doesn't understand crypto. Great insight. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:22:56
Nice, two of the most corrupt nations in the world using bitcoin. This is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:48
The fact that "experts" are predicting it to rise to anywhere between $20k - $1mm should give you another reason why bitcoin is nothing more than a complete gamble that will probably end with a big 0
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:00:36
you forgot the /s
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:09:49
Newsflash, emotional sentiment is already being influenced by every crypto "expert" and fanboy who has a voice. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:54:28
Did I miss Tesla completely replacing the auto industry with their car? Might want to go back to the drawing board on that analogy. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:26:03
Did you ever find one. I am looking too but really don't want to verify through bitstamp that requires you to send them a copy of your license or passport. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:39:30
You came to the wrong place if you wanted to make a rational argument based in reality. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:14:41
How long should people be willing to let interest mount on credit card debt? Even if you believe bitcoin is the future, which I’d be willing to bet is not the case, it’s probably decades away. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:21:45
Decision making skills seem to be underdeveloped. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:15:27
The thing is that I am invested in it, but don't believe it has any long term value. for me its the equivalent of playing numbers in roulette. Either I lose it all or make a bunch and walk away from the table. Anyone putting money into bitcoin thinking its a good long term investment in lieu of say an IRA or 401k is taking an enormous risk. I'm like the 90% of people who are just trying to make a quick buck in bitcoin, but am not afraid to admit it.
And please get back to me in the next few months when transaction fees are down to zero. But something tells me you wont have any news to report on that front. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:14:25
Who says I am not involved? Just because I think bitcoin will eventually be worth next to nothing doesn't mean I am not currently capitalizing on it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:30:07
amazing to see the bitcoin community start talking about which financial institutions to support. I thought bitcoin was going to replace them all?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:21:21
Lol. 3 years....
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:11:11
I’d call it a delusion. But gl
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:31:36
I think one of the more delusional and insulated positions bitcoin proponents hold is their belief that there is some large majority out there who want it to completely replace the banking system and fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:55:25
So you expect that in only a few years you wont need fiat because all your local stores (supermarkets, gas stations, clothing stores, restaurants, mass transit, online retailers, utility companies, landlord/mortgage, etc, etc.) will be accepting bitcoin? 
Yeah, let me know how that works out for you. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:20:05
lol yahoo finance is a joke
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:20:47
If you’re getting your talking point from Kim Dotcom you’re a fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:13:33
Bitcoin isn't an investment, imo. It's more like day trading penny stocks. Sure you can make huge gains, but you can also lose a ton in the blink of an eye. The swings are wild and generally unpredictable with no real fundamentals to make sense of. I also don't really see what the end game for it is. It's incredibly inefficient and expensive as a payment method, and there are thousands of other coins that can be used as a "store of value." So why chose bitcoin, which is one of the least efficient and effective versions? Because it was first? 
At the end of the day, governments are going to regulate the shit out of these things, which is the antithesis of its mission. There is just no way they are going let them operate without getting their share. I also believe that it's only a matter of time before banks and even the likes of Amazon will make their own block chain backed technology that will actually gain mass support and have a practical purpose. 
At this point I think bitcoin is 90% people trying to get rich quick (which is fine), and 10% people who actually believe in the cause. I think its a recipe for inevitable disaster. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:59:40
Congratulations, you sound like an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:01:00
If this guy overdrew on his account to invest $300 in Ethereum my guess is that he doesn't have a tax consultant or a financial adviser. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:35:14


The thing is, gold's value is based on the fact that alchemy isn't real and we can't produce any more gold. Gold is also used in many practical applications.
Sure bitcoin is similar in that only x amount of coins will ever exist. But there is nothing stopping thousands of other coins popping up doing exactly what bitcoin does, but better. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:01:41
Ahh, the great minds investing in cryptocurrency. Gives me a lot of confidence. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:39:15
If he’s wiser than you thought how are you not surprised. Your comment literally does not make sense. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:59:10
nice job
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:26:03
A total economic and foreign relations disaster.  
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:15:25
At this point it's gambling, plain and simple. If anyone tells you different, turn and run. They are not there to help. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:00:30
I’m trying to but the website is a disaster. Says verification isn’t even available. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:25:54
"Lets see who has more muscle"
Without question, the banks.
"thousands of customers"
Thousands of customers doesn't mean shit when millions of customers couldn't care less whether their bank is suspending crypto accounts. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:55:17
Lol I was agreeing with you. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:36:37
 I’m aware of how it has been doing. But just because it’s been posting gains doesn’t make it a reasonable financial decision to over draft on your accounts to essential gamble. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:36:43
Yeah, it's definitely a huge advantage to pay astronomical fees for transactions on a things people are promoting as a currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:18:30
I am not allowed to care about something I find absurd and that is probably going to burn a lot of people?
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:03:41
I would definitely not recommend buying on credit if you don't have to. Its a great way to start and/or reinforce really bad financial habits. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:32:52
I don't think people here understand how big the financial industry is in general. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:25:50
You're right, this week has been rough. But I was lucky enough to buy at some lower levels to where I am still up. Of course I only put in what I was okay with losing. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:33:09
You are an utter moron if you think the stock markets rise since 2009 is comparable to bitcoins rise. Be less informed, you can't.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:34:17
My guess is they'll make their own blockchain backed technology and all but destroy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:31:11
Never said the technology sucks. I think blockchain technology is very promising. I just don't think the first iteration of cryptocurrency that has yet to prove a widespread practical use has any long term value. 
Enlighten me though. Why bitcoin and not one of the other thousand + alt coins out there?
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:09:43
That holds for traditional equities. But is really bad advice regarding bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:48:00
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:01:11
I agree that all nations are corrupt. But its ignorant to think America is more corrupt than Russia. It objectively untrue. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:04:05
Yeah, but not everyone can be responsible, and it is therefore the banks fault/problem! - Most people in this thread.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:17:56
So rather than over drafting why not just buy ethereum with a bank account that actually had the funds? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:27:22
Wild to think that someone who has $40k to throw into crypto would be stupid enough to include all that information.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:29:48
Only years away before what? It replaces banks?
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:42:51
This makes absolutely no sense in the context of the question. Let’s hope you don’t run for government. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:31:18
Lots of stop losses will start triggering. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:26:17
This week - not capitalizing.
Last 12 months - I am doing alright.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:06:50
You make $200k a year and have so little in your account that you had to overdraft by $300 to by on pure speculation? Something isn't adding up. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:31:57
When did I make any statement about how mining works?
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:58:13
Are you suggesting Buffet is where he is at today because he was right about one industry?
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:32:32
Let us know how that turns out...
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:33:34
Woof. That sucks. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:59:18
Maybe it will, maybe it wont, hence the use of the word probably. But it certainly isn't ignorant to think a totally made up "currency" that is slow, expensive, and competing against thousands of other coins will eventually cease to have any value. Just because I am not delusional doesn't mean I am ignorant.
