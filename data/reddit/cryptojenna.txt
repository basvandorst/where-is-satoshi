Another step towards the global cashless revolution

Joking aside, this is a really important psychological barrier when it occurs. Very bullish for the near\-term :D

Big institutions are going to be seriously assessing entering the crypto space \(those that haven't already\) now that the 'crash' is over and optimism is returning to the markets. HODL :D

Tim Draper: Eyebrows &amp; fistbumps. Absolute legend!

The market's current situation has got me wondering when it will once again cost 10,000BTC for 2 pizzas :'\) I kid of course. HODLers will prevail!
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:13:55
This is actually how I bought my very first BTC almost a year ago\- a very important bridge between crypto and the real\-world for potential investors\- putting aside the extortionate fees, of course :D

Twitter integration with BTC wallet= WIN. We can only dream.

You don't often get to see one of your childhood cartoon characters come to life XD

Incredible idea :D you should get donations just for your ingenuity!

Speaking on macro\-terms, so long as it's correct to assume that adoption follows advancement, which is generally the case, then it's only a matter of time until we reach the ATH once again. Unless the whole market crashes for good, of course, but with the speed of tech advancement for BTC, I can't see this as a realistic outcome any time soon!

I'm of course bullish on BTC long\-term but I have a feeling that Mr McAfee will be eating a sausage dinner come the end of 2020

I think at least for the forseeable future it will be a case of crypto and fiat existing alongside one another, there are too many powerful forces at play who do not wish to see crypto take the place of fiat.

Everyone needs a vacation, but I think it's time for Bitcoin to get back to work ;)
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:32:44
Where I live your lambo would just get stolen so you're better off with a corsa :)

Good ol' Roger Ver and his Bitcoin misinformation campaign, unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your stance of BCH)
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:13:47
The banks are running SCARED. Bitcoin provides an extremely attractive alternative to fiat for anybody willing enough to learn about the tech. Such a shame most banks are anti\- or neutral on BTC, instead of trying to adapt to the inevitable, but we will prevail! HODL :D
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:16:57
It feels like there's some market manipulation currently at play; weather the storm guys, HODL strong :D
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:33:23
I know the market has been (to put it mildly) boring for the last couple of months. But unless the tech is going to be completely abandoned, surely it's ONLY A MATTER OF TIME until we reach and surpass the ATH. Stock up while it's cheap :D
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:30:58
BOOM! This is exactly what we need; easier access for the general public to convert fiat to BTC. I know many people who are afraid of using even centralised exchanges, but have used the BTC ATMs here in Manchester, UK, because they feel somehow safer dealing with a physical machine. At the very least a great gateway to crypto for the masses :D Even if the fees are extortionate most of the time :P
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:27:23
Bang on. I fear this type of manipulation will remain part of the crypto economy for a while, but not in the long term. HODL people :)
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:55:31
Yeah that's exactly what I said, you're so smart... If you believe that this industry is not dying literally right now and has any kind of future, then its very continued existence and progression (however quickly or slowly) bring new natural growth and investment as it advances- up to and way past the ATH, whenever that may be
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:43:48
Been telling my friends the same this past week! Glad I just about got my fiat deposit in time :D feeling like a boss lol
