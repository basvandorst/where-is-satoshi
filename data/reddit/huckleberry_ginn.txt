There is clear evidence of accounts on this sub Reddit pedaling info and upvotes based on the manipulators agenda. 
Bitcoin has been manipulated since it really started to see large gains. You think hedge funds and other well resources investment shops were avoiding an asset appreciating at 20% a day? No way. 
Just like politics subreddit, there is a troll farm on this sub Reddit appeasing people manipulating this market. I'm not invested in crypto and I do envy people who got in early, but fuck, this is a pure speculative bubble and it's very dangerous. I'm afraid of a lot of people losing TONS of money buying in now before the massive sell off.
It's dangerous and please be careful.

Thank you. I really am just trying to understand. I work with financial markets but this concept is a formulaic market with a controlled release of bitcoin with a clear end. This is so weird compared to other limited resources.
Gold is a precious metal but we don't know when it will run out. It could run out in 2030 or 2450, we don't know. We do know, however, bitcoins supply ends 2140.
Not to punch back at those criticizing my knowledge base, but I think a lot of people are replying in a defensive aggression because a lot of bitcoin investors don't fully grasp it themselves and lash out in response. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:03:57
Yes, i don't. Which is why I asked questions with my assumptions. Why the harshness? I thought this sub would be a good place to learn. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:48:16
Cool. As mentioned in the thread there are a lot of weaknesses in classic financial institutions, but I think a lot of questions are still on the table about the future of bitcoin. 
It seems like a very innovative idea with great upside and great downside, which is why I categorize it as a speculative gamble at this point. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing unless people are selling their house for it..
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:17:29
I was walking through my assumptions I had made and clearly indicated at the end of post 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:41:54


^ building a $100 billion market cap product on an idea and a hope seems very speculative to me. But to others, it may not.
What I'm currently struggling after 4-5 hours of research is the current market growth. Currently, with a 12,5 bitcoin release per 10 minutes, this results in 427k per hours, 10.2 million a day, and 3.7 billion. This is assuming $5,700 as a price. If the price reaches $7,500 these numbers change to: 563k per hour, 13.5 million per day, and $5 billion a year. These numbers are a supply that exceeds demand.
The reason why most markets function is because of supply and demand functions. If supply is a constant amount, it could fuck with the interaction of demand and exacerbate a fluctuation. 
And yeah, it's not a bubble till history says so, I agree.

High frequency trading is not often speculation it is creating a price target via fundamentals 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:54:41
I totally agree. What is this currencies relationship with the current economic cycle. Will it be counter cyclical? Will it provide a hedge against traditional investments? 
We don't know... and we won't till another true recession, but I'm not dismissing bitcoin. I've said places, I'd be happy to allocate 2-5% of my portfolio but I'd accept it as a gamble. So many people on this sub Reddit are blind optimists. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:51:55
The amount of trades a day is not a speculative question or not, you don't seem too familiar with traditional investment markets. This is a liquidity point. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:22:54
Well, I guess my own worry is the whole market place is based on cpu power. Hackers can't alter the block because of the CPU power on the side of miners (*see I'm not sure but this is my understanding now).
If miner supply decreased and a hacker had the CPU resources to hack a chain, then the coin itself could be hacked. 
I may be far off but it would seem that as miner supply decreases--&gt; CPU power decreases --&gt; hacker success increases?
Yeah, after learning more, the transaction fee can make up for the mining, but this may lower its value relative. (Obviously none of us can foresee currency in 100 years :) ) 
Thanks for answer, I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:04:58
I think so many people invested in bitcoin have little idea what they're actually invested in and the long run economic value of it. Everyone shrugs and says it will be fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:42:16
I will after work but I don't buy anything that says the bubble doesn't start to 400% growth lmao 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:46:33
No, completely new to this universe. There is a wide spread concern about the life of bitcoin at its max capacity (21 million) because the validity of the chain will not be monitored by miners because the reward is not there. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:06:20
Well, the reward is diminished over time, right?
It's an assumption that efficiency will pace with lower reward? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:06:55
It is a lot like gold, and I fear that one day, people will decide it's just a few characters with no backing behind it. Like the tulip mania which people have mentioned before.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:06:56
But VC is seeking a strong return from a product that few people know of. It's investing in your local tech shop with an innovative idea.
This is a cryptocurrency that is not currently being used as a currency because of its volatility - this seems to be agreed on by even the strongest supporters. Bitcoin is a pure speculation bet right now with a backbone of a formulaic system. The difference is when this shit starts to collapse, there is nothing to bolster it. It's tulip mania all over again. I don't think many would consider a bubble in 2011 when it was barely worth anything. It's a bubble when after 8 years of existence the price jumps from 4800-&gt; 5800 over night. That is speculation that isn't a release of information or anything.
Markets react to information, the information around bitcoin isn't changing often because it's a rule based system. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:01:43
So the currency won't deal with the market fluctuations because of the stable release of 12.5 per 10 minutes. 
Which is a strength of the market for sure. I still think currency started without any backbone is highly risky. Gold and other precious metals are based on a long history. They are trust related and I know bitcoin had the trust element built in but still... worrisome that it has no underlying ties. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:04:15
Okay, well I'm open ears. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:16:11
Yeah. I'm considering buying after a price collapse as a means of diversifying my portfolio (2-5% across different cryptos?). But with the current trajectory I have no idea when it will fall off a cliff. The recent gains seem baseless and more so pure speculation. 
Then again I think this entire currency (AT THE MOMENT) is pure speculation. In the past and maybe in the future it was and will be a currency but at the moment, no one is truly using this as a currency - at least I wouldn't imagine they are.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:44:38
Well, almost everyone in this thread and who I have talked to has said that bitcoin is not currently used as a currency. I could pull numbers but I bet transactions are low, it's simply too volatile. 
I mean, what causes the jump from 4800-&gt;5800. Obviously an opinion but absolutely nothing changed in a day. It's just speculation fueling Growth and this is the derivative of a bubble.
I think it's a fine investment but to say it's anything other than a speculative gamble is a little bit off the deep end - in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:57:02
So who regulates or decides when to expand the supply? Isn't this the issue of a decentralized currency?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:29:19
But the available gold in the market is comparable to bitcoin at the moment. Theoretically, gold will run out. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:08:17
I'm sorry but 300k trades for a 96 billion market cap is next to nothin. GE has a 196 billion market cap and 30-140 million trades a day...
Yeah, I agree and have said elsewhere in the thread that I would consider 2-5% of my portfolio in crypto. It's just a speculation bet though, which you agree with. It's not an investment honestly, it's a pure gamble. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:00:18
Well, their profits depend on their security. If they get hacked, their stock prices fall and they lose money. There are contracts where money is insured up to a certain point. A hack on the block of bitcoin could cause an instant collapse of the "DNA" chain. I may be wrong here but from my understand of how miners operate in piecing together the transaction history, a hack could have enormous consequences. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:46:38
Haha, well, nobody cares about my opinion, sure. The market, however, is an aggregation of everyone opinions, that is how a price is determined. A market is like the guess jar for number of gum balls in a gum ball container. Usually the average of the guesses is pretty damn close to the true amount. This logic applies to the market as well for any item.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:13:56
Cool, good overview
