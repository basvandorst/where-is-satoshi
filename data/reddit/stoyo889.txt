Did you short lol
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:04:34
Miners take a cut so it's not zero, but it's a lot lower yes

If I was this whale, I would:
\-Use the BTC to get heaps of Tether
\-Continue pumping price of BTC via Tether
\-Gradually sell some BTC on the way up

Price of Bitcoin is determined by the majority of exchanges, the circulating supply, market cap etc.
If someone owns 100k Bitcoin and arranges an otc over the counter sell of the coins it doesn't take place on an exchange. Therefore sometimes the Bitcoin price won't move up and down based on there massive orders done in person.
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:50:55
If this whale acquired btc a long time ago otc the holdings may not be fully factored in. So yes it's possible.

Not until it can scale pal. Needs lightning asap for full merchant adoption.
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:23:41
Ln and batching
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:21:16
When LN is ready everything will be handled automatically ie you will never manually have to create/close channels it's all done by LN/wallet. LN is probably going to need another 6-12 months before its ready though.

You troll, who is laughing? I made the post, there is no schadenfreude here enjoying the misfortunes of ppl ruined by corrupt governments and banks mate. 
You accuse everyone here for being a dummie, go back under a bridge where you belong.
At the end of the day there is clear evidence that volume for BTC trading increases from countries going through economic turmoil or hyper inflation and this post was simply pointing out that. Do you understand this mr Spartacus McTroll?
@_date: 2018-08-31 06:46:37
Haha thanks mate had a good laugh reading your post on the train. Do me a favor and sell your coins and unsubscribe. You can't handle it clearly. Your head is like a Pentium 1, very dated and simple.
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:07:12
Interesting - SEC made comments that majority of BTC held was controlled by a few wallets. This could be an effort to split up the bags of some major hodlers to make BTC look a bit more spread out? It's all happening pre VanEck ETF which is the big one a lot of ppl are waiting. Just a theory...
@_date: 2018-08-31 01:18:56
Agree, I dont want or like this but it's inevitable with the broken system of money, debt structure, bonds etc that we have globally. 
Something that can help is DLT tamper proof money. If it's not bitcoin, the only other solution is a digital DLT currency that is backed by gold. Either way BTC will complement what ever future money there is, i am a permabull for a number of reasons.

I can tell by your post you either have a low iq or are under the age of 21. The research is already out there cretin go and look into it before insulting others. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:35:10
Mine it
Get paid in it
But it with Fiat
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:18:04
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:15:10
Exactly some sideways movement with minor ups and downs is fine. Ppl just expect a space x rocket one way to Pluto just calm down ppl.
@_date: 2018-10-02 02:59:33
Your the hero BTC needs and deserves. I will try and chip in!
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:19:22
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:59:50
I agree, not only that but it's less energy intensive. I personally would love to see BTC fork into a proof of stake/shard chain. We could be performing 3-4k TPS like Zilliqa if we did that. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 05:45:24
mate I hope so otherwise LN/mass adoption will be much harder!
Its just hard to find a clear roadmap on LN/usability as opposed to other projects. Not a bad thing maybe because its open source it's this way...
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:52:40
Awesome that's what I was looking for. This has put me at ease to know everything lightning related will be handled automatically behind the scenes! Any eta on when lightning will be ready! Some people think this year or next...
@_date: 2019-02-26 10:53:51
Sorry means fk all since 90 percent of btcs value is traded vs PayPal which is transactions/purchases.
@_date: 2019-04-24 04:39:53
Who says every user needs run a node? Modern lightning wallets will auto manage opening and closing of channels. The user never has to do anything other than adding btc and paying
@_date: 2018-11-02 00:54:39
Which is why BTC needs to modernize and move to POS. Mining giants and satoshi religious extremists wont allow it.. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 08:21:12
Auscoin lol
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:35:41
Still faster than pos though. Not saying it's the perfect solution but better than pow. Nexus is unique in using 3 methods for security and scale. Iota and nano are cool too.
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:58:19
Not the only way but the faster way it would happen. Those assets would still have value but btc is in a way digital gold. You can transact quicker, online and  across borders with btc, can you do that with gold and silver?
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:09:03
Is there not an energy cost to mine, refine, protect and store gold? Btc might cost more energy but still, physical assets don't cost zero energy. I also think with the fast up take of solar, the energy issue won't be problematic in a few years. I also hold iota and Nexus. Very little energy cost compared to btc, and they are quantum resistant.
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:45:20
It will complement Fiat and gradually grow to dominate most transactions. Eg by 2025 twenty five percent on of transactions will be done in btc by 2035 sixty percent etc. I don't think it will ever completely wipe Fiat.
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:39:25
Global financial collapse (Fiat crashing basically via hyper inflation) which is still highly probable especially for the USA could be the ultimate catalyst to make crypto and btc completely dominate and takeover Fiat.  Either way you should hold btc, not holding somecould be the biggest mistake of a lifetime.
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:26:09
I wish they did actually. With pos you can easily achieve 100+ tps on chain with lower fees. It's also much more sustainable but slightly less secure. If they forked to do this the miners would just keep mining the old chain calling it Bitcoin cash 2 it Bitcoin super lol
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:12:46
Yep, lets keep reposting this every month or so. Its basically the best introduction to what BTC is and why its so important. Great listen for anyone who thinks its useless or scam. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:32:02
Umm no, maybe 24 hours ago but it's dropped very hard since.
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:06:55
Wrong, lightning is secure, but it cannot March the security of the main chain end of story. Btw your also wrong about channels, wallets will auto control all things channel related, used won't even have to know what a channel is. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:20:27
Not interested, IOTA already does this but its super centralized, same with Nano. Lightning achieves almost unlimited scale and its getting better everyday... I have used it myself. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:18:45
Its a 2nd layer of tech that sits on top of the bitcoin ledger (layer 1). When you take your BTC off the first layer and put it in a lightning wallet, you can than make payments that a very very fast and have incredibly low fees. 
The only trade off is the txns are less secure. 
Lightning is suppose to be for ppl paying for things under 1k USD - anything over or larger should be done on the BTC chain. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 03:23:33
In Australia we have living room of satoshi, a website that lets you pay any bills with bitcoin. This allows you to have a credit card with a small 1k limit, pay it off via LROS and use the card to spend at merchants that dont accept bitcoin yet. 
Canada has Bull Bitcoin that does the same thing, Im sure there is one for your country. 
Another option would be to withdraw fiat from a bitcoin ATM for day to day spending, but some of the fees are bad on some ATM's. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:11:25
Think of how many ppl would jump at the chance to buy BTC at 2 or 3k. Very hard for BTC to drop below 2-3k. Just be patient, Baakt by end of Jan may swing sentiment in a positive direction. LN should be ready by mid 19 also which will help adoption. I just bought BTC at 3.6k, not worried. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:42:42
Yes a country could develop there own lightning wallets and the wallet will display the countries unit of currency, but in the back end it's all btc. Current wallets already have the option to show the tough Fiat amount 
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:13:03
Lol Bitcoin will make more than 1.5 percent in the next 12 months I can guarantee it
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:23:28
relax - that type of condescending attitude wont help adoption. Paraphrase - 'you would be a fool not to own some bitcoin now, yes its risky, but it will also be a huge mistake not to own some' link them to Pimliano's off the chain discussion with Murad - great starting point, or even Andreas recent talk on youtube.
To help adoption you can also install a user friendly btc wallet on family and friends phones, send some satoshi's over and show them how easy it is to use and secure....
@_date: 2018-12-17 03:24:52
Fkn all wrong, im always at bars, eating out, and love going to the movies. Whoever wrote this needs to be slapped repeatedly. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:19:09
Me too pal, dont worry 2019 will be huge. Baakt, more economies tumbling and ppl seeking shelter via BTC, LN nearing completion which will help adoption etc etc. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 10:01:34
Yep bitmex definitely is and I hope it gets fkn shut right the fk down. I knew the moment futures were introduced that it would drive the price down.
