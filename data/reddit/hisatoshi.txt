I'm guessing this sort of thing requires manual review so someone has to sign off on it.  Bitcoin has been going through record growth due to all of the recent press and I imagine they are up to their ears with AML\KYC requirements for all the new users.  Just keep bugging them. :)

That is not Satoshi telling us what to do.  That is Satoshi describing the process from a technical point of view and nothing more.  In that same thread he also agrees with Theymos that running an alternative client is not recommended.  Which is what the BU team is advocating.  He says we can phase in changes "later if we get closer to needing it" but he does not elaborate on the criteria for needing it and the process.  I would lean more towards phasing meaning soft fork rather than hard fork but I am extrapolating.

That is not bitcoin.  What will happen is that bitcoin will continue to be bitcoin and banks that cant use bitcoin directly will not use it for direct payments.  Someday we will have wallets that can automatically transact between different crypto currencies at the same time and you will be able to use whatever crypto you want.  You will probably not choose to use bitcoin to buy coffee but you might to buy a computer online or a car, maybe even a Tesla. :)

In the same linked thread you can see Satoshi warning against doing what BU is doing(running an alternative client).
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:15:07
Bitcoin isn't really private.  Privacy comes at a high cost in terms of resources needed to run a node so it likely won't be incorporated into bitcoin itself but rather offered on a side-chain in the future.  Right now, you need to be very careful with how you acquire and spend your bitcoin to achieve privacy with bitcoin because all transactions are public and can be traced.
  
There are alt coins that specialize in privacy and they may fit your needs.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:41:17
There is no real evidence that the hash rate is real.  At this point we should question everything that cannot be verified 100% and we cannot verify that the miners signaling BU are actually running BU nodes.  I would bet a big chunk are actually core nodes spoofing BU.  Question everything.

You've probably triggered AML\KYC requirements by sending so much money at once.  I bet you haven't done that before or don't do it often.  They aren't going to let you play with that money until they fulfill their reporting obligations.  Just a guess.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:39:01
I'm fairly confident that Coinbase will issue BU coins and associate them with your balance at the time of creation.  I am confident they will not let you do anything with them until BU has implemented code they don't appear to have written yet.  I don't personally believe there will be a fork anytime this year.

Maybe I have this wrong but I think it is actually a serious condemnation of BU.  I am reading that BU will not be traded or fully supported until BU can deal with replay attacks.  That is an affirmation that BTC is treated as the main chain if there is a fork.  Am I missing something?

Yes.  We all have to worry about this because if someone finds a way to do it, they will do it.  If you notice over in the other sub, people are complaining about the attack and trying to accuse core for it.  But in reality we don't know who did it and it would just as likely happened if the bug was in core code.  I don't doubt for a second that rbtc would be frothing at the mouth if the roles were reversed.

How much is your identity verified on Coinbase?  As a first step, you might want to save yourself some time and just go hand over all your information and make sure you are verified to the highest level.  There is no getting around this if you want to use an exchange like Coinbase or Gemini with the amounts you are discussing.

Bitcoin: 'Blood Diamonds' Of The Digital Era
  
Jason Bloomberg ,  
  
  
I write and consult on digital transformation in the enterprise.
  
Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.
  
Bitcoin has long been the transaction currency of choice for drug dealers and extortionists, but this month, the IRS has upped the game. Just as tax evasion finally took down Al Capone, now the IRS is looking for tax evaders and other tax cheats who have been using Bitcoin in an attempt to hide their tracks.
  
The IRS recently subpoenaed customer records from Coinbase, a leading Bitcoin exchange. However, the subpoena is but the latest skirmish in a years-long war against criminals who have been leveraging Bitcoin for a wide variety of nefarious purposes.
  
The specifics of the IRS subpoena, however, make one thing clear: the majority of Americans who trade in Bitcoin are likely breaking the law.
  
Coupled with Bitcoin’s popularity among ransomware extortionists and all manner of other cybercriminals, we must now face a chilling realization: the underlying value of Bitcoin really has little if nothing to do with its artificial scarcity or popularity as a medium of speculation.
  
On the contrary – the only reason Bitcoin has value to anyone is because of the underlying value as a medium of exchange for lawbreakers. If we could flip a switch and eliminate all illegal uses of Bitcoin, there would be nothing left of the cybercurrency.
Bitcoin: Strength in Numbers
  
Zach Copley
  
Bitcoin: Strength in Numbers
  
The ‘John Doe’ Summons
  
The most recent order from the IRS to Coinbase is a ‘John Doe’ summons, which means that the IRS isn’t naming any particular Coinbase customers, but is rather issuing a blanket request for information about a large number of individuals – even though the IRS may not have any suspicions about all of them.
  
In response, Coinbase says that while it has a policy of complying with all legal orders (of which this is one), it believes this one overreaches, and is thus fighting it in court. “Suffice to say, we feel the IRS’s subpoena is overly broad and incorrectly implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes,” writes Coinbase Cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong in a blog post. “Asking for detailed transaction information on so many people, simply for using digital currency, is a violation of their privacy, and is not the best way for us to accomplish our mutual objective.”
  
The IRS, however, is on firm ground with the John Doe summons. “The IRS uses John Doe summonses to obtain information about possible violations of internal revenue laws by individuals whose identities are unknown,” the agency says. “The IRS not only has a suspicion that the John Doe class includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law – it knows that the class in the past included such violators, and very likely includes others,” it continues.
  
Such noncompliance, in fact, may not always be intentional. It’s likely many Bitcoin enthusiasts are inadvertently running afoul of IRS’s guidance that Bitcoin is property, not currency. As a result, every Bitcoin interaction is potentially taxable individually, leading to a paperwork headache for active Bitcoin traders.
  
Be that as it may, the IRS has reason to suspect virtually all Bitcoin traders have fallen into this trap. According to the IRS, it “searched the MTRDB [Modernized Tax Return Database] for Form 8949 data for tax years 2013 through 2015.” Form 8949 is the one that Bitcoin traders must use to report their activity. “Those results reflect that in 2013, 807 individuals reported a transaction.” Furthermore, the number for 2014 is 893 and for 2015, it dropped to 802 individuals.
  
Given the number of US citizens to conducted at least one Bitcoin transaction in 2015 probably numbers in the tens or hundreds of thousands, 802 is a mere drop in the bucket. The IRS is quite justified in presuming, therefore, that the vast majority of American Bitcoin traders are breaking the law.
  
Rationalization to the Rescue?
  
Armstrong’s exhortation that the IRS summons implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes is thus an overstatement. More worrisome, however, is his opinion that taking a legal action to enforce tax law is a violation of privacy.
  
The blogosphere, in fact, is rife with related rationalizations. The most extreme Libertarian proponents of Bitcoin are against taxes and the IRS in general, and even for those individuals who allow for the necessity of taxation, many believe that they are justified in using Bitcoin to evade more onerous legal constraints like the ‘Bitcoin is property’ guidance.
  
Another fallacious line of reasoning: the IRS is overstepping because they’re looking for a needle in a haystack. “It amounts to nothing more than asking for large amounts of hay in the hope they might find a needle,” opines Michael Beckerman, President and CEO of the Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Coinbase as well as companies like Alphabet Google GOOGL +0.79%, Facebook FB +0.98%, and Amazon.com AMZN +1.33%.
  
Such arguments, however, do not sway the IRS. “The IRS not only has a suspicion that the John Doe class includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law,” the agency says. “It knows that the class in the past included such violators, and very likely includes others.”
  
Charles Stross, popular author and blogger, summed up the situation nicely. “Bitcoin is pretty much designed for tax evasion,” he quips.
  
Tax Evasion Merely the Nail in Bitcoin’s Coffin
  
Running afoul of the IRS, however, is merely the focus of the latest news. The fact remains that Bitcoin is enormously popular for all manner of criminal enterprises, from illegal drug dealing to extortion cons.
  
The most popular con, in fact, is ransomware. The US Justice department reports that ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016 to an average of 4,000 per day, with extortion amounts ballooning to $209 million for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $24 million for all of 2015.
  
While there is broad agreement that most of today’s ransomware extortionists demand payment in Bitcoin, there remains disagreement as to whether Bitcoin is the primary cause of the rapid growth in ransomware attacks.
  
Is Bitcoin in fact tied to the growth of ransomware? “It’s helping. I think that’s definitely true,” says David Emm, Senior Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab. “The existence of effectively anonymised payment mechanisms definitely plays into the hands of cybercriminals.”
  
Maya Horowitz, Threat Intelligence Group Manager at Check Point Software CHKP +0.32% Technologies agrees. “It makes it much easier to avoid law enforcement,” she says.
  
And while it’s true that Bitcoin is not fully anonymous, many criminals are simply using a Bitcoin-based money laundering operation known as a ‘mixing service.’ “If you want your money in one wallet but you don’t want anyone to be able to trace it back and know how you got it, then you take it though a mixing service – like money laundering – and then it all eventually gets back to you after being mixed with other money,” Horowitz says. “It’s pretty standard for Bitcoin.”

@_date: 2017-03-28 18:52:13
Cue the Rationalization Again
  
Once again, however, there are a number of voices seeking to diminish the connection between Bitcoin and ransomware – or criminal enterprise in general.
  
One argument: if it weren’t for Bitcoin, bad guys would simply use something else. “The reality is cybercriminals will always use what is available to them,” explains Greg Day, VP and CSO, EMEA at Palo Alto Networks. “In many ways they’re inherently lazy, so if Bitcoin wasn’t there they’d find a different process to channel funds through.”
  
Another argument: paper currency is just as bad, so why all the fuss about Bitcoin? “The U.S. government should find it awkward to regulate bitcoin on the grounds that it facilitates illegal transactions,” opines William J. Luther, Assistant Professor of Economics at Kenyon College and an adjunct scholar at the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. “Its own currency — and the $100 bill in particular — has done so for years.”
  
And then there’s the argument that Bitcoin isn’t really anonymous in the first place. “If you catch a dealer with drugs and cash on the street, you’ve caught them committing one crime,” says Sarah Meiklejohn, a computer scientist at University College London. “But if you catch people using something like Silk Road, you’ve uncovered their whole criminal history. It’s like discovering their books.”
  
Silk Road, of course, was the Bitcoin-driven clearinghouse for illegal drugs and stolen credit cards (and other contraband) that law enforcement shuttered in 2014. Bitcoin – and Bitcoin-related crime – have only flourished since.
  
Bitcoin-centered ransomware is so popular among the criminal element, in fact, because it is dead simple. Any modestly skilled bad actor can simply download the software off the Dark Web, create a Bitcoin wallet, and send out phishing emails to find gullible targets. The number of such extortionists and the typically modest ransoms are usually sufficient to avoid law enforcement investigations – a gamble such criminals are obviously willing to make.
  
Is that Bitcoin in Your Wallet? Didn’t Think So
  
For the readers of this article who are law-abiding citizens, the cold reality is that there is little reason to get involved in Bitcoin in the first place. “Bitcoin transactions are not very useful in casual purchases, thus there has been little mainstream consumer adoption,” admits Mikko Ohtamaa, CTO of Gibraltar-based cybercurrency trader TokenMarket. “Bitcoin shines in anonymous online payments and most day-to-day and/or point-of-sale payments don’t require this level of anonymity or the complexity it brings along with it.”
  
The final question for law-abiding, tax-paying citizens who may be interested in speculating in Bitcoin: does the fact that the cybercurrency is primarily used for criminal purposes taint it for other uses, a la blood diamonds?
  
Such a question of morality is beyond the scope of this article, but important food for thought for anyone interested in using Bitcoin for legal purposes.

This is why all the talk about full blocks and raising the block size is bullshit.  No matter how reliable the network is, even when you are getting your transaction into the next block every time, it still takes 10 minutes for at least one confirmation.  It is a tired argument because this is how we have achieved good security and is why people are even looking at it to begin with.  SegWit and LN can't come soon enough.

Bitcoin started off anonymous in practice and will continue to trend towards near total enumeration in its maturity.  The act of creating coins is itself mostly anonymous.  As the coins are sold or moved on the blockchain this changes because the blockchain is not opaque and people make this situtation even worse through their actions.
  
This being said, if you are resourceful you can use bitcoin anonymously.  But you have to source it as anonymously as possible and preserve it through your own actions.  In the end, criminals will use everything available that fits the situation.
  
There are coins trying to fix this and one looks like it has but everything comes with compromise.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:46:18
Don't be silly, cryptocurrencies can be anonymous.  They mostly aren't because it is not easy to implement and comes with compromises that need to be addressed.  Only one coin has really achieved it and that is monero and it has compromised on scaling.

I did not soften my argument.  The risk is in the hard fork to get there and the increased resources needed to run a node thus raising the barrier to entry for participation.

Wu and Ver are selfish actors and 2M fixes absolutely nothing.  They are pushing for something that causes a hard fork and core is resisting a hard fork unless it is needed.  2M does nothing but introduce risk while segwit actually fixes things and make improvements without a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:52:57
It would be maxed out quickly and would increase if the cost of supporting the network which could ultimately weaken it.  So it doesn't fix anything because it is not a solution for scaling like segwit.  This issue is not as simple as you say.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:54:34
Bitcoin cannot scale to serve everyone without side chains and segwit enables it.  There is no reason for a hard fork at this time.

There are a lot of different answers to your question depending on who you talk to.  The proposals he has backed have been reckless.  His tactics have been reckless and I personally appreciate on some level that the system is being tested in this way by him.
  
He is backing proposals that are reckless and people hate him for that.
  
He is backing alternative communities and pushing boundaries and people hate him for that.
  
People hate on him for lots of reasons but I've given you the main ones that are relevant today.  Ver is a bad actor, keep your eyes on him. ;)

Yes.  As soon as he realizes gains, whether they are currency or property he owes on the gains either short or long term depending on how long he held.

@_date: 2017-05-04 16:20:21
Your argument falls flat on its face here because Wu and Ver have both endorsed SegWit under conditions so clearly they are alright with that complexity if they get what they want.  And what they want fixes nothing.

You are being disingenuous or you really don't understand this.  Raising the blocksize to 2MB fixes nothing because we cannot scale bitcoin to serve a global population by raising the blocksize.  And by raising the blocksize we create a barrier to entry for people as time goes on due to increased resources needed to participate.  There should be as little barrier to entry as possible to participate, especially this early.
  
It is widely agreed and accepted that bitcoin will have to have sidechains to scale to meet a global demand.  There is no way around that with current technology.  Segwit makes sidechains safer and is the first step towards our ability to serve global demand.  To stand in its way for an arbitrary block size increase that does nothing but introduce risk is reckless and I consider you a bad actor at this stage in development if you support it.

You have to hold the keys in order to ensure the techs future(ask Elon Musk).  That is the way it is in today's litigious environment.  The author knows this, admits from the very start that his accusations are based on nothing except his past experience which is arguably not applicable since we are not writing a standard that people are forced to adhere to in order to participate in the market.  In fact our environment is the exact opposite of this with people bucking and redefining standards on their own and constantly moving the goal posts.  I hope they have a bad day.

I disagree.  These loans are usually at very low interest and can come with additional perks if they are for things like buying your first home.  Your average wage slave isn't going to get a better rate.  Now taking out a loan to buy bitcoin, that's just crazy because of the risk.  Never invest more than you can afford to lose and if you are taking out a loan against your retirement, you probably can't afford to lose it.

Blocks will always be full and raising the blocksize impacts full nodes so we can't just raise it arbitrarily.  We need layer 2 for bitcoin to properly scale and we've always known this.
