Stupid question. Sorry
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:09:46
About time 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:26:19
Yes after a while...
 Who cares... 
   It's normal and good
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:42:07
Once Airbnb start accepting crypto...  cryptocribs will suffer
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:34:23
God Dammit coinbase. Pay developers 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:15:05
Haha where do you guys come up with those ideas haha
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:18:25
Was worst 2 weeks ago
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:50:41
If you believe in a coin you hodl through the storms.  Long term it is a winning strategy. Trading can reward much more but comes with a higher risk.  I Was planning to sell all yesterday and rebuy lower... thought same 2 weeks ago too.  That sucks lol 
Also planned to dump at other times just to see them go up 20% next day. Glad I didn't sell
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:57:07
Look for otc trade 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:25:49
Bch guys now scrambling to find a new strategy
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:57:04
Nopp will be cheaper longterm
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:57:36
Great news! Moving in the right direction 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:15:23
I mean a coin that is actually being used and getting adoption.  Not coins that have a whitepaper and nothing more
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:58:54
Awesome.  That's true
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:13:06
I guess. Xlm got boosted though  was planning to load up the other day :(
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:11:03
Wow still missing. You need to take the next step in putting pressure. Legal 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:58:06
Market did not care... 
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:11:04
Don't know but you can google
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:44:29
negative 
..  even if he sells.... it would be impossible
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:17:47
Just hodl or trade(gamble)
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:59:49
Like asking what is the winning lottery numbers
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:39:46
Ouch to the guy. Never have 100% in one place. Not even in a bank
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:57:20
how does 1 bitcoin look like?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:38:29
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:19:16
they like to manipulate the market
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:08:11
you would think they would pay many developers to accelerate development of bitcoin. it is in their best interest. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:09:11
any sources.  visa on lightning? did not hear that before
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:29:16
haha  reminds me  of bcash
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:07:39
20k will look cheap in a year
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:01:04
i imagine holder with huge amount of btc have began paying developers to speed up things.... investing in lightning network and the likes
that would make economical sense.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:00:45
might look better 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:58:34
yea... every time he talks.... bcash looks less appealing lol. he likes to play dirty and in the long run it will not work 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:13:04
someone else sells 100.000 worth of coins and cashed out 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:00:52
the bounce will be nice 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:02:34
after Jan3 when people get back to routines. we can start seeing activity up
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:30:42
you will feel it when it crashes and you will not have time to react
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:24:07
lightning  network
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:57:25
hope they also enable segwit
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:29:43
5-10 % of net worth is a good investment
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:08:26
send small amount and find out 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:20:54
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:19
yea that is the best strategy. no one expected to grow so fast when it did
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:00:03
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:02:31
you need to do your own research.... .. people will say anything. pick a project/coin that you feel has great potential.  invest what you can afford to loose.  don't be afraid when value drops like 25 %. hold and it comes back most the time. if you sell you lost if you hold you recover 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:58:59
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:43:04
I'm not selling.  this is normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:17:10
this is wow super fast too. 2018 will be amazing
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:00:27
ok share address to check
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:38:28
once released mass adoption will take off.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:48
I don't think that is it but I m holding regardless 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:46:38
no but here is the deal.
1- to move from hard wallet to exchange fast enough would cost me $$.
2- I am not in for fast profits. i compare it to interest a bank would have given me and if in 2 years it's 20k a coin that out beat the bank.  of course I expect 50k by then but even if not anything more than 30% profit in 2 years is being greedy :) (600 profit on each coin)
3- I am diversified in ripple and other coins so who cares if btc corrects. lol healthy.
4- too much fud spreading by bcash. people expect btc to suddenly reduce fees. it will take time. I have time.  also what Roger says is bullshit. less than a penny to send  a million and instant.  lol people believe anything jesus is telling them.
5- 2018 get your space suit on
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:42:15
it's like they brainstorm and keep creating posts on the internet about how they are better
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:03:31
me too
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:33:34
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:10:29
not really but ok.  market cap is calculated on last highest paid btc price.  so 10 coins at 1 dollars10 dollars.... now someone decides to buy a coin for 10.000
now market cap 10x 10000 .= 100.000   
so it is not exactly worth that much 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:07:44
haha I think he is angry he missed out and thinks it is too late. I respect his post though, we are all entitled to our opinions
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:35:09
never sell btc unless you need the money. you can't beat bitcoin lol. I tried many times and I gave up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:04:45
fraudsters did not enable bch btc trade. they know that would have been good for btc 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:34:02
don't panic  sell if it drops to say 9k
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:28:58
hahaha not going to happen 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:27:56
you have a point 
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:48:09
indeed he did
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:51
now only at 20k 30 k 50k
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:21:59
no cash. my new strategy Will be to always have some cash around
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:19:42
better it is like night and day
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:39:33
exactly 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:40:32
I feel they talk about bitcoin if they have something negative to say.  most are bcash fans
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:51:25
pull back is healthy
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:06:05
at the time I guess
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:52:27
real bitcoin
I'm bitcoin etc 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:44:08
what if...just what if...   he is nakamoto ?
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:17:25
not this time
@_date: 2018-08-02 18:05:47
me too cloudminingbitcoins.com
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:44:49
lol what do u think lol
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:52:56
people spend more to charge their phones... etc. Your point? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:00:06
and bitcoin is least of concerns when it's available and IF cryptography is the same then
@_date: 2018-05-10 05:34:32
and they too would hace been lucky.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:32:33
millionaire?  yes 288k would be hard but if you are a millionaire you can move on. sucks either way :(
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:26:06
yes share actual link to banks site.  this can be created by anoyone
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:21:54
Almost no one clicks that  link anyway
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:52:04
he was lucky and had enough money to risk
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:01:11
not a problem. just like we went from floppy to 128 gb usb. technology is constantly improving
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:59:20
people these days are so ignorant and believe anything they read.  if I post I made a million. someone will read and tell a friend this guy on the internet made a million even if I just made it up. ps I have 2 heads 5 arms
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:11:14
that is what they have to call it to keep it
@_date: 2018-05-25 05:08:27
i would like to know too
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:24:16
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:49:00
it's the media that will attend and release a shit load of news on the web. that will bring new people
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:20:59
person just wants to spread fud
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:07:04
haha way Off
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:53:58
made my day
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:32:00

@_date: 2018-06-24 18:22:12
lol happy to see 10k in july
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:30:13
the domain of that site alone makes me disregard it immediately
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:05:40
dollar dirtier
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:07:46
lol. wonder what club I'm in for buying more
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:59:26
what is a lot? for me it's like 100 coin for another 12
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:59:32
no need to prove anything.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:20:10
lol I never thought people can be so ...ignorant. sorry but it is the truth.  lol cant stop laughing. you made my day. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:16:37
lol happy to see 10k in july
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:57:32
that was one hell of a 10 year trend
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:31:42
someone getting fired soon lol
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:38:39
at 10k same was said
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:17:06
lol happy to see 10k in july
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:42:05
I'll hodl
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:18:37
yea haha that would be nice.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:10:23
so funny
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:25:36
the dump will be epic as the pump
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:24:45
the idea is that it will be much more usable ... cheap tx. fast tx etc.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:40
ok. good luck.  that is a gamble
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:24:26
coinbase are trading you bcash 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:55:00
but all this is a pump.  it would not be at that price if it was not for the forks and FOMO..   
so once that is done with what can a correction bring it down to?
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:00:34
never took me more than 4 working days.  just make sure you entered everything correctly and reference code. did you do it through online banking? cause Clerk  could have done a typo?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:30:09
10k by xmass
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:28
you can't predict the turning point.
exchanges crash and you are unable to get back in.
safer to hold until you are needing to cash out
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:55:43
it was expected guys. goes up comes down and goes higher.  I sold at 8200 earlier.  only half of my coins since rest are in safe keeping lol.  people take profits and rebuy same coins cheaper.  don't panic
how low can this go?  6500? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:33:58
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:25:21
btc will bounce back so I am ready for 2018
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:12:23
10 %
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:12:37
correct.  unless the wall I removed or dumped to fill the order 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:57:02
that was dump.  i Said mega dump ��
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:31:53
you mean bear market not bull
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:51:30
did a payment a week ago came in. not sure why you had issues. maybe your bank had  a typo in the reference that you need to enter so kraken knows who sent it
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:54:35
very stupid
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:33:36
miners need to get paid. nothijng is free in this world man. be realistic. ok 7$ might be steal but if you transfer 100.000 USD 7 is nothing.  perhaps  they should have it a % so on small transfers it is just pennies. 
i just see people posting... fee 60 usd fee 45 usd... I am just curious where?  probably coinbase fees etc and not btc
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:49
but their profit potential is capped so they... those big players will decide ..to just buy the real thing
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:37:44
kraken goes down but it is also due to surge in interest from public. even coinbase hangs
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:49:52
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:27:18
or nano ledger
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:52:03
5000 complaints? source please
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:55:03
if people believe it is worth 10k. the market will react and 10k it will be
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:02:32
does that mean 21 million club ? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:22:26
I have had issues on other exchanges too. even coinbase.  so unless you are trading on many you are unaware of the state of the other exchanges under peak  traffic 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:28:42
Roger ver might dump his btc but many ready to get In on cheap btc and get it to 20 and forget 10k.  last attack just made btc stronger. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:40:03
they are all the same.  change and find out 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:15:52
depends on life style 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:51:24
blame Roger ver
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:33:11
thanks. it was luck but I was watching big buy wall on btc that was at around 5500 and figured it is a good entry point.   but who knows what happens next 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:45:47
at that point you probably thought it was heading for 10.000
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:50:36
inter galactic travel
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:07:05
buckle up
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:18
hold ... trade and you will be back higher 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:00:39
you have a point. didn't think of it in that perspective
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:59:22
I don't think it is worth it. they will learn about it in due time
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:24:44
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:25:05
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:36:55
we already know that.everyone knows that. now it gets to 10 he Will say he predicted it 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:14:57
yes many of my friends think the same .. until I explain they can buy fractions 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:33:58
I like how that red line is drawn close to tulip mania peak hahaha no were close yet
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:15:11
a keeper
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:17
profit taking. normal
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:30:24
I assume you have been cleared for deposit of that amount? just a question don't get mad lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:29:28
no doubt it will and correct as people cash out profit for holiday season
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:37:36
by morning. thank you koreans in avance 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:02:14
satoshi nakamoto has equal amount of bch as btc. he can easily collect bch and dump and his coin is saved.   
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:47
exactly.  all people watching said it was high are now really excited
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:45:03
it never ends haha
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:59:48
bch was a nice train to ride. earned me a shit load and got so many btc and now  btc will head to ath
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:09:05
and if it goes to 0?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:42:38
exactly but great opportunity to take advantage of rocket
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:23:00
only if it was in cash or an Exchange for some property etc...  quick deal
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:53
veterans knows this is normal
noobs  panic selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:24:35
that is What i came across too
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:01:02
that Is bad
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:42:32
just hodl
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:48
expecting more now is a gamble.... you end up buying in higher 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:31:48
I got out on time and bought in at 5500 per btc.  it is already going down on kraken. sold bch at like 2400 now it's 1950. high was 2599 briefly on that exchange.    site crashed and was lucky to get a small window to sell all for btc
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:34:21
risky but he will see profit. just make sure to take out your initial investment and wish for the. best on the rest.
but yea this is a fake post  I think. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:14:48
expect turbulence on the way due to bch winds 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:36:45
i just look at it as.... last year this time it was way cheaper.    my Bank give me 0.75% interest. holy cow 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:40:14
no you didnt
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:26:49
Cash is being used less and less with or without crypto
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:42:39
1 year
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:15:11
To order 20000 btc have 20.000 x 3600 usd in fiat in Tour exchange
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:59:55
 It would be priced in the new price and market will not care
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:15:13
I believe so
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:02:04
so when we hit 2900 on btc that chart pretty much out the window
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:50:15
I would pick 35 or so coins easy :---)
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:12:47
No one would process crypto with credit card not knowing who the buyer is. Too risky for chargeback.  Maybe 50usd can pass but bigger amounts will need verifivation
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:45:29
About time. Better late than never
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:12:03
They banned exchaange ceos from leaving. .... harsh enough
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:03:30
We still have the usual weekend dip to look fwd to and Monday sec mertings
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:17:34

@_date: 2018-02-05 02:16:39
Tank for me please :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:52:36
Can't stand the guy. His ads keep showing all the time on youtube
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:28:39
yes but they have failed at many other attempts like waves     now move along Google fan boy
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:50:32
not unless you sell your coins :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:47:20

@_date: 2017-10-24 13:32:22
