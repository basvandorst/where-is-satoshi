400k came from him equating the market cap of bitcoin with the market cap of gold. He’s literally saying his minimum value on bitcoin is £4m because that would equate the market cap of bitcoin with the market cap of gold. He even says that in the quote you referenced: “400k it would be digital gold and equal to gold’s market cap”. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 08:44:47
So in the 400k scenario, gold becomes worthless and bitcoin takes its place? People start making jewellery out of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:25:12
OP  came up with $400k because it equates to the market cap of gold. In order for this argument to work bitcoin would have to take 100% of gold’s market cap.
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:00:25
Ok, we’ll then the market cap of gold is irrelevant to the argument 
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:48:17
Ok, great. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:10:05
The comment I originally replied to used the market cap of gold  as a basis for valuing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:32:07
You kind of did. You said you think 0.1 Bitcoin could be worth $400k because it would equate the value of bitcoin to the current market cap of gold. This would only be relevant if bitcoin takes all of gold’s market cap. If the argument is that bitcoin is a substitute for gold, your argument falls down if bitcoin’s market cap is the same as gold’s is now, and gold’s market cap is unaffected. An increase in the market cap of gold would cause an equal decrease in the market cap of gold. 
If your argument isn’t that bitcoin is a substitute for gold, then the market cap of gold is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 08:28:35
Your $400k estimate is just a finger on the air estimate then. 
At the moment there is $7.8 trillion worth of assets that people want to hold in gold. If bitcoin is has the same purpose as gold (which is the basis of your $400k estimate) then that $7.8 trillion has to be shared between gold and bitcoin if no new money comes in. I think you agree with me here.
If your argument is that extra money can flow from other asset classes to the gold/bitcoin asset class, then even if we assume 100% of that money goes to bitcoin rather than to gold (which I think is a ridiculous assumption, based on nothing), then $7.8 trillion would have to flow from other asset classes to bitcoin for it to reach the market cap of gold.
Now we reach the crux of my issue with your estimate. $7.8 trillion is completely arbitrary here. Why do you think $7.8 trillion is going to flow to bitcoin in your worst case scenario? Why not $20 trillion? If $7.8 trillion new money does come into the gold/bitcoin asset class, surely it’s just as likely (or arguably more likely) that $7.8 trillion flows from stocks to gold?
To summarise: if your $400k estimate doesn’t allow for new money coming in, see original argument. If it does, then the $400k number is based on an arbitrary amount of additional money coming in from other asset classes. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:41:56
In reality, no. But it is in the context of OP’s $400k estimate. He’s valuing bitcoin at $4m per bitcoin because it equates the market cap of bitcoin to the market cap of gold. If the argument is that people will use bitcoin as a store of value rather than gold, then it would require everyone holding gold to sell and buy bitcoin instead. This is where the $4m valuation falls down.

In answer to your question, no I don’t think amazon will create a crypto currency. However, i do believe that if society lost faith in fiat and started to value bitcoin more, Amazon may well create their own rather than use bitcoin. Crypto gaining traction is bitcoin’s first battle. Maintaining its popularity in a world where a few massive online retailers will have such influence, and could potentially be competitors would be battle number 2.
Also, I wasn’t comparing bitcoin with childhood drawings. I was using childhood drawings an example to illustrate that scarcity isn’t a source of value. I agree it amplifies value though.
Also I never really get the speed and cost argument. At the moment I can transfer money instantaneously and for free through my bank. Why would I want a system which costs peanuts and is only almost instantaneous?

I would say forget about the $500 you’ve lost. It sucks, but it’s happened. Now you have to decide whether you would like to invest $500 of your wealth in bitcoin. If the answer is yes, keep it invested. If it’s not, disinvest.
A big factor is whether you’re willing to lose it. Bitcoin is a very volatile asset. In a years time it could be worth nothing, it could be worth 10x what it is now. No one knows. If your life would be a lot worse if you lost the $500 disinvest now. If not and you believe in the product, keep it.
One thing to keep in mind: assuming crypto currency catches on to the mainstream, if the mainstream chooses a different currency, Bitcoin is worthless. Bitcoin was first, and has the highest market share at the moment, but imagine the impact if amazon, google or Facebook created a crypto currency. Investment in bitcoin is not the same as investment in block chain or investment in the concept of crypto currency.

@_date: 2018-03-14 15:21:34
Yes, exactly. Think of it this way. If the spot price is $8,000 and the 1 month futures price is $9,000 then you could buy 1 bitcoin and sell 1 bitcoin future. Then in 1 month, no matter what happens you’ve made $1,000. This is because you can use the bitcoin you bought a month ago to settle the futures agreement (I.e sell it for $9,000 even though you bought it for $8,000. 
If the futures price was actually a lot higher than the spot price, then you could short the spot and buy the future.

Eh? My argument wasn’t ad populum and I don’t particularly care about whether bitcoin is or isn’t defined as a currency.  
The point is, a currency can’t be too volatile to be effective. If you disagree that that’s common sense, I can expand. It is important for people to know how much they can afford to spend on goods and services each week/month/year. If the currency they use is too volatile they won’t know this. I can expand further if you like.

I can kind of see your argument if this was an illiquid market, but this is a liquid market. 
Let’s say you had $19,000 3 months ago and decided to buy 1 bitcoin with it. Then you still have 1 bitcoin now, but you are worse off than if you hadn’t bought bitcoin. If you had kept it in USD then, you would still have $19,000 now which you could use to buy 2.5 bitcoins now. So effectively, you are 1.5 bitcoins worse off from buying three months ago. 
Trying to say you’re not in a worse position now is delusional. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:55:25
Yeah, but you’ve got less buying power with it. If 1 bitcoin used to be able to get you 10% of a Lambo and now it can get you 5% of a lambo. You’ve lost 5% of a lambo worth of stuff per bitcoin. You’ve lost buying power.
 If you have a mug but it breaks, you still have all the pieces, but that doesn’t mean you haven’t lost anything. A broken mug is useless. You won’t feel the loss until you next want a cup of tea, but you’re worse off from the moment the mug breaks.

More specifically, if you have more people wanting to buy than people who want to sell, the price is driven up because there’s not enough supply for the demand of the wannabe buyers. If there’s more people wanting to sell than people who want to buy, then the price is driven down because there’s not enough demand for the wannabe sellers.
Basically, if there’s one chocolate bar between the two of us, that chocolate bar becomes more valuable because we both want it. If there’s 4 chocolate bars between us, it’s a lot less valuable.
Bitcoin is like that, but instead of a chocolate bar which releases happy hormones on consumption, it’s a bit of code which releases happy hormones on its value increasing.

I think the bigger point is that houses have an inherent value that is measurable. You can model the overall growth of a population, you can model the rate at which new properties are built, you can model  a stream of cash flows that you could get from renting out a property. There’s a lot of information people can use to come up with a valuation. Because of this, it’s unlikely that the market is going to ever overvalue properties by more than 100% or so. So when the bubble pops, properties aren’t going to lose 99% of their value.
The problem with bitcoin is that it’s impossible to value it because it doesn’t have any fundamentals. The only thing it’s got going for it is that it’s the first mover. It could conceivably lose 100% of it’s worth.
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:32:29
Drawings I did when I was a kid are scarce. Doesn’t mean they’re worth a lot of money. Scarcity on its own does not create value.
It’s all very well being the first mover, but if someone big who is already involved in a lot of the world’s transactions (e.g Amazon) decided to create their own crypto currency, bitcoin’s first mover advantage wouldn’t stand a chance.
@_date: 2018-03-10 10:18:38
It could still work. The reason only 10% is cash in a bank is because they’re lending you other people’s savings. E.g if I put $100 into savings, they may lend $90 of that to you. You use it to buy a new lamp. The person who sold you the lamp puts the $90 in the bank. The bank then lends $80 to someone else who buys them self a lamp. Eventually that $80 ends up back in the bank. Then there’s me thinking I’ve got $100 in the bank, and two people thinking they’ve got $90 and $80 in the bank even though there was only $100 to start with.  As long as no one defaults on their loans and we don’t all want to redeem our savings at the same time, it works alright.
There’s no reason this couldn’t work with bitcoin if banks started operating on bitcoin rather than money.

I don’t get the issue with people using young accounts. Most people browsing reddit are usually very passive on it. They use it to view content and don’t really contribute. Occasionally people read something which makes them want to contribute and it’s often a lot easier to create a new account rather than to try to remember what the account they used very briefly 6 months ago was called. I personally also don’t like the idea of there being one place where you can see everything I’ve ever said on social media. This is why I personally have made about 7 or 8 accounts in the 7 years I’ve been on reddit. 
I guess you have to ask yourself what’s more likely: a handful of bitcoin millionaires spend their days making new reddit accounts trying to encourage small time holders to sell so that they can buy more bitcoin cheaper, or a handful of people with an interest in economics are fascinated by what is happening in this market, but find it difficult to hold their tongue when they see misinformed people putting in significant portions of their income into a system which they believe out of faith and desperation will skyrocket in price over the next few years.
If the former is true, why wouldn’t these bitcoin millionaires just create dozens of new accounts each every day and spam the subreddit until 99% of all comments are negative rather than just create on account every few weeks and right a couple of negative messages?
People post negative messages about bitcoin, because from an independent outsider’s perspective who has a basic knowledge of economics, this subreddit makes bitcoin look like a cross between a pyramid scheme and a religion.
For bitcoin to be a success, vendors need to start accepting it and employers need to start paying it. This won’t happen until volatility drops right down which won’t happen until speculative traders lose interest

It’s the same as borrowing money and investing it. If you have $1000 and borrow $4000 to buy $5000 worth of bitcoin, then the current value of your investment is only $1000 because you eventually need to pay $4000 back, but you have $5000 worth of bitcoin exposure. Therefore if bitcoin doubles in value, you have $10,000 worth of bitcoin, and owe $4000, so you have $6,000 of value. You’ve then made 500% profit whereas bitcoin has only made 100% profit.
The very bad downside, is that if instead of doubling in value, but coin were to half in value, suddenly you only have $2,500 worth of bitcoin, but you still owe $4,000. So your value is now -$1,500. I.e not only have you lost your original $1,000 investment, but you’ve lost an additional $1,500 as well, which you have to find a way to pay up.
Bitcoin is already the most volatile ‘asset’ I can think of. Leveraging it up is just asking for trouble

He’s got a point though. The only thing that’s going to push the price up massively, is a sudden boost in demand. I don’t think that’s going to happen unless someone with a lot of influence says crypto currency is the future of all transactions. As it stands I don’t think anyone would say something with this much volatility is the future of transactions. People want to know how much their weekly shop is going to cost them each week. Crypto currencies can’t regulate volatility in the same way actual currencies can.
Suppose crypto currency is the future. If Bitcoin isn’t the chosen one, it’s rendered useless. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:53:13
I am with you on this. Block chain has inherent value, bitcoin does not. Bitcoin’s value increased because people expected it to. Now the only people who expect its value to increase are the people who already have it. As soon as these people have run out of new money to invest into it, demand will dry up and volume traded will die right down. People will be holding onto their beloved bitcoins and hoping for change right up to the point where they need the money for something real and are forced to sell. By this point everyone else will has lost interest in bitcoin and they’ll have to sell for incredibly low values.

Low interest rates are designed to encourage spending. This helps boost the economy. If no one’s spending money, business owners sell less, workers earn less and the economy comes to a stand still.
Inflation is just a by product of monetary policy, but it encourages investing rather than spending. This also helps boost the economy.

What you’re saying makes no sense. How can you say Bitcoin will help get the power back to the average Joe, and also that if the average Joe waits until Crypto is accepted it will be too late. 
If what you’re saying is correct, the power will merely be transferred from banks to the early adopters of Bitcoin. That does not sound like it’s an improvement of what we have at the moment. Why would the general public buy into a new system like that? At least the current system is regulated in an attempt to stop corruption and manipulation.
@_date: 2018-07-21 17:52:15
I’m no expert, but I thought inflation was pretty volatile (at least in the U.K.) in the past, when the government focussed on fiscal policy to control the economy. Then when there was a shift to using monetary policy, inflation volatility went right down. Please correct me if I’m wrong though.

What’s the significance of 7800?
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:16:28
I disagree. For example:
Imagine I borrow 100,000 to buy a house. The guy I buy it off now has 100,000. He wants to save it, but wants to make a bit of interest on it so he lends it to someone. The person he lends it to uses it to buy a house. The cycle repeats. The same 100,000 is getting lent out over and over.
It doesn’t matter if it’s done centrally through a bank or through peer to peer lending, it is the same mechanism. If people lend money to gain an expected interest and borrow money to be able to be able to do projects quicker, money supply will increase.
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:00:21
By selling them in the future. The mechanics behind it is this: Bitcoin’s current value is $7k. You promise to sell me 1 bitcoin in a week’s time for $7k. Thing is, you don’t actually own any bitcoin at the moment. 
One week later you buy a bitcoin, and you sell it to me for $7k as promised. Let’s look at two scenarios one week after we formed our agreement.
1) the bitcoin price is $6k. You buy one and instantly sell it to me for $7k. You’ve just made $1k.
2) the bitcoin price is $8k. You buy one and instantly sell it to me for $7k. You’ve just lost $1k.
The effect is the same as if you had held negative 1 bitcoin from day 0 and sold it on day 7.
The risky thing with selling futures is that there’s no limit to how much you can lose. You know how people say “only invest what you can afford to lose”, you can’t do that if you short. If in a week’s time bitcoin’s price is $20k, you lose $13k. If the price is $100k you lose $93k. If you don’t have the money you declare yourself bankrupt. 
As a completely independent person with nothing at stake, I would advise against shorting such a volatile asset.

It wouldn’t do anything in the long run and not a lot in the short term. 80% of bitcoins which ever will be mined already have been. The regulator wouldn’t have much wiggle room to affect the supply of bitcoin. At this point it’s demand which is controlling the volatility of bitcoin, not supply.

First of all, thanks for not shouting at me. I’m not sure what your point is though. Ok, maybe if I demonstrate the same example in two systems: 1 with peer to peer lending and 1 with fractional reserve lending you’ll be able to tell me where I’m going wrong.
Peer to peer lending:
Person A lends 100k to person B. Person B buys house from person C for 100k. 
Person C lends 100k to person D person D buys house from person E for 100k.
Total cash = 100k (which person E has)
Total value of loans = 200k (B owes A 100k, D owes C 100k).
Value of cash + loans = 300k.
Fractional reserve lending:
Person A deposits 100k in bank. Bank lends 90k to person B. Person B buys house from person C for 90k. 
Person C deposits 90k in bank. Banks lends 80k to person D. Person D buys house from person E for 80k.
Total cash = 80k (which person E has)
Value of loans = 170 (B owes bank 90k, D owes bank 80k)
Value of bank reserves = 20k
Value of cash + bank reserves + loans = 270k
Ok, now let’s look st the situation all the people are in in both examples.
Peer to peer example:
Person A has 100k if B doesn’t default
Person B owes 100k but has a house
Person C has 100k if D doesn’t default
Person D owes 100k but has a house
Person E has the actual 100k
Fractional reserve example:
Person A has 100k if bank doesn’t default
Person B owes 90k and has a house if they don’t default.
Person C has 90k if bank doesn’t default
Person D owes 80k and has a house if they don’t default
Person E has 80k of the original 100k
Bank is holding the other 20k of the original 100k
In both scenarios person A, C and E all think they’ve got money the sum of which adds up to more than the original 100k.

Banks don’t like bitcoin because they don’t want their debtors going bankrupt.

@_date: 2018-04-06 07:14:11
I disagree with your first paragraph. There are always buyers and sellers. Broadly, the market drops if more people want to sell than people who want to buy, and it rises if more people want to buy than people who want to sell. Obviously, it’s to do with volume rather than number of people, but it was easier to write that way. 
If a market hits the bottom, it is because the number of people wanting to sell becomes in equilibrium with the number of people wanting to buy. This could either be because the lower price has attracted more buyers or because its deterred the excess sellers. Usually, it’s both. It is not purely down to the sellers, like you say above.

Interesting theory, but it’s not a logical one. Prices won’t rise in May just because that’s what they’ve done for the last two years. If you can form a rational argument for what would cause the price to rise every May, then you much have something. But without that, I would say your prediction isn’t very useful.

First of all, you’re quoting from the 1700s. The banking system is nothing like it was then. Second of all, private banks don’t control inflation, central banks do, and by the way they’re independent of the Government.
Also, you haven’t addressed anything I said. You’re saying that anyone who doesn’t invest in bitcoin when it’s really cheap will be left behind. This implies that when bitcoin takes off, the power will be in the hands of the select few who were early bitcoin adopters. This isn’t the same as restoring the power to the people. What you’re describing is a shift of power from the banks to an equally small number of people. How is that a better system?

That still results in more money than exists being in circulation. Any type of lending results in this. Banks aren’t just imagining money out of nowhere. They’re lending other people’s money and that is what causes an increase in money supply. The same thing happens with peer to peer lending.

If enough people try to buy at the same time, the price will go up. No one wants to be the last person to buy in that situation because you will be the one buying at the highest price. If I knew a large amount of bitcoin was going to be bought in a short period of time, and I was contributing to that I would want to make sure I get in there first so that I get the best deal.
My point was, it doesn’t make sense to have everyone buy at 12pm in their own time zone because then the more west you are, the later you are to the party. 
It’s supply and demand. You are increasing demand, but not supply. The first wave of this extra demand trade with the people willing to sell at the lowest price. The second wave of buyers don’t have the same choice of sellers to buy from. They end up trading with the sellers who were prepared to sell for a bit higher. The last people to the party take the dregs left after the rest of the additional demand has traded at whatever price it can get.
As a very simple, but extreme example, let’s say there are two limit orders on an exchange to sell BTC. One at $3,600 and one at $3,650. Let’s say there are also two limit orders to buy at $3,590 and $3,550. 
Ok, so then the bid price is $3,590, the offer price is $3,600 and the mid price is $3,595. I.e the exchange quotes the price of BTC as $3,595. 
Now let’s say you convince two people to buy bitcoin right now.  The first person will match with the $3,600 limit order. After this, the offer price (next lowest sell order) is $3,650. The bid price is still at $3,590, so the mid price is now $3,620. I.e the exchange quotes the price as increasing from $3,595 to $3,620. The second person to buy will match with the $3,650 limit order and pay a higher price than the first person.
Now of course, this is a very extreme example. In reality, the effect will be a lot smaller than this, but if enough extra demand is created, it will increase the price of bitcoin and it will be the people joining later who get the worst deal

If you’ve managed to convince people to invest $10 and hold it, the resting price will be higher than before, but it would be the same as if you convinced those people to invest $10 over a staggered time period. Convincing people to do it in one go will just increase the bid/ask spread meaning you’re paying more money to market makers. I.e the people you convince will, on average, get in at a worse price.
