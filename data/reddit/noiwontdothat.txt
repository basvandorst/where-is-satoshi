You should monetise this by selling as a print only purchasable with BTC.
Pretty sure you'd make BTC.

Promoting the actual spending of BTC is a great thing to do.
Stay cool.

Why would you tell anyone you have bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:01:36
This is still publicity for Bitcoin.
If it's in the news then it's being fed to the public.

If you can live without the money then go all in.
If you need money for life costs; continue DCA.
If you go all in and it's a lot of money to you, you'll probably sell at the first correction - me.

Why should we waste our time convincing you of anything?
If you can't be fudged to do your own research then you simply aren't ready for it.
Stay being governed by others and believe what you are told.

Use Coinbase as an 'on-ramp', but you should be transferring to cold storage after each purchase.
Get the Bitcoin Ticker widget and plonk that on your home page - you can set it to pull prices from Coinbase at an interval of your choice.

What does the gold chart look like today, I see the image only goes to 2009-ish.

I went to the link in the bottom right and its some sketchy 'exchange'.
