FYI: if you want to short this, wait until everyone in here starts saying the “correction” is over.  This will probably happen when the price recovers to 11, 12 or 13k in the coming weeks or months.  Wait till EVERYONE is convinced that the “correction” is over.  This will happen, remember what it felt like going from 11.6k to 17.1k just a few weeks ago.  That is the way it will feel.  That is the time to short this market.  
Under no circumstances should you use leverage to short the market, you will get rekt, I guarantee it.

I’m in gbtc in my Roth right now. 
GBTC is great when the market is going up.  It actually outperformed bitcoin from its inception through the end of the bull market.
GBTC performed abysmally in the bear market.  I’m ok with holding it right now, because I don’t believe there is much downside left to the bear market, if any.  But I want to get out of it on the next 6 months or so if possible and into actual bitcoin or if E-Trade is able to offer something that tracks bitcoin 1:1, I’d be ok with that too.

IMO if you sell at 40k, you are probably missing out on the biggest gains, but a win is a win.  
If BTC ever manages to get to 20k (I’m betting it will, but maybe 5 years from now), then it will reach close to 500k once the fomo and hysteria sets in, and then crash back down to 50k or so, but that’s years and years in the future if it happens at all

Because holding long term will inevitably lead to holding it through a bear market, which like I said above would be disastrous for capital preservation, versus holding actual bitcoin.
