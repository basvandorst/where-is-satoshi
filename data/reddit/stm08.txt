its almost guaranteed to be, cause it only measures the geek vote.

the voting machines and process is currently untrustworthy.

Dont forget that the average person probably isnt named joe, more like jose or mohammed. 
And, just as an example, jose could utilize your item  and trade some pesos for bitcoin from a friend. And now jose is much more capable of participating in a global economy, which might mean he buys media, courses, products, raw materials for a project, whatever.
This is far more painless than trying to get into, for example, the visa network, in the third world. 
Anyways, thats my counter example to "literally nothing to offer to the average person".

The average person is broke and locked out of the credit card / banking system altogether.

Try getting them to workout, lift weights, or eat healthy. Should go just about as well. You cant change people, no matter how much it would benefit them.

I do suspect that it's 90% politeness, 10% keeping antennae up for scams or extortions or other problems. 
It only rubs me the wrong way if I'm already in a bad mood.
And it helps that my tellers are smokin hot....

Neither money nor algorithms can have a plan. And nobody knows what the inventors plans were/are. Certainly Btc can't replace currencies without first coexisting with them. ..
But yeah, companies can switch--they'll have to learn a bunch of new stuff and invent policy though. Think of who gets allowed to use the company credit card. It'd be like that, only with each BTC addresses containing money. 
In fact, it could even make budgeting within a company easier, if each department could only spend what's allocated on their particular wallet. Interesting.

There would need to be a cogent argument in order to debunk it. Brb buying new lives in mortal kombat.

That would certainly be a complex way to not solve the problem...
