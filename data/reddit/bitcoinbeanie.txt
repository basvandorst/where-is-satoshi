Bitcoin can’t and won’t be regulated. And if the exchanges can’t grow some balls and tell them to fuck off then we will stop trading on their platforms. It’s very easy to play underground. This is why I️ warned people of that clownmegroup! I️ knew this was coming.

Well we will just have to move our money to monero. A lot of sites are starting to accept monero. Tired of this. I️ loved what Bitcoin stood for as a currency but now it seems as if it’s going to hell. Thank the CMEgroup. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:30:10
This has nothing to do with bitcoin. You’re not even using Bitcoin. You’re using cash. The way I️ see it is, they’re very much piggy backing off of bitcoin’s growing popularity. The fake news wants to make it seem like it’s because of them(CMEgroup) bitcoin has gained much more adoption but that isn’t true. I️ really wish they would go use ether and make people bet on that. No real bitcoin user is going to support this madness. We are not in to make those rich assholes richer. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:25:37
So don’t spend Bitcoin? Everyone must buy and hope to get rich? Instead of spending it and using it as the currency it was meant to be? Instead of helping countries with hyperinflation? Instead of supporting bitcoin businesses? Everyone must get rich quick without contributing to the bitcoin ecosystem. You want to get rich quick? Go play the lottery and go to casino!

You can’t even buy a damn thing with your bitcoin because you complain about high Tx fees like a little baby. But you want irs to tax you on top of tx fees? You’re a psychopath. If I told you to buy a beanie from my store you would tell me that tx fees are too high but then you want to pay irs lol funny little kid.

@_date: 2017-11-06 17:55:20
As I suggest? Or as the white paper tells you what it is for? The fees must be paid! Miners aren’t eating electricity for free. Choose the right fee and wait! How come I support bitcoin business and never have a problem? Do you complain about inflation, bank fees, atm fees, paying merchant service etc? No! So don’t complain about paying miners for the advantages you gain when using bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:59:52
You can beat them. Shapeshift beat them. Move out of the us. It’s that simple. You don’t have to comply. They would be going against everything bitcoin stands for if they comply. If the irs regulates bitcoin it would be pointless to have bitcoin. You are better off putting your money in a bank to decrease in value.

Bitcoin is only taxed by miners. It kills me how people are willing to let government tax them and they are already whining about tx fees....Funny! So now you guys will pay two fees!

Bitcoin is NOT a STORE OF VALUE. It is a digital currency! Read the white paper for Christ sakes! Keep thinking it is a store of value and you’ll be fucking drained! What do you think will happen if everyone holds....its purpose will never be fulfilled. I spend bitcoin all the time and never have any issues! Thank me for helping!

It affects bitcoins protocol by making people shy away from using Bitcoin. By the negativity that will come behind them using bitcoin in their gambling joint, people that would have been interested in see how incredible bitcoin is are now going to look the other way. Sad that you can’t see this. Quit reading fake news for a second and get into reality. The protocol gets affected when no one uses it. Bitcoin isn’t as great as it should be today because of the scum like the ShitMEgroup. Rich punks that want to get richer. How the fuck can you try to gamble on a unpredictable market. Then your going to have criminals trying to manipulate the market at an all time high. Man this is just fucking bad!!!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:52:13
Shit even if you get in at 350 now it won’t be late. If you get it at 350 now you’ll have about 5% of a bitcoin. So let’s say the price of Bitcoin hits 1million, your 350 will be 50,000.......That’s amazing if you ask me.

That has NOTHING to do with Bitcoin! That is what you don’t understand! It’s just betting! They’re using Bitcoin’s name. You can be blind to the facts all you want but I️ see them for what they are. A RIGGED GAMBLING JOINT for the rich and lazy! Who am I️ to say who’s a real bitcoin user? A bitcoin user! Someone who supports and is surrounded by people that supports bitcoin. See, a lot of you guys are just in bitcoin to get rich quick, but not I️. Bitcoin’s name shouldn’t be used for scams and rich punks pushing a false agenda for their own benefit.    Bitcoin at its core is about escaping the fraud! Using blockchain tech! Now these rich regulated punks want to mix the fraud in? Not going to happen! I️ definitely would not waste my time with them.

Bitcoin wasn’t made to be taxed. Bitcoin was made to be a decentralized crypto currency. Bitcoin is the total opposite of what Uncle Sam stands for. Further more, Bitcoin can’t be taxed. The irs can only put pressure on those corporate punks. Localbitcoin.com serves a great purpose and in the end it will be the only site that matters. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:04:44
Who said bitcoin was a company, trademark or a dumb little club for you to talk nonsense about? The point is Bitcoin is called Bitcoin and the way the public perceives bitcoin can determine its faith! You are clearly so blind to the facts! Who gives a flying F*** about those contracts? They are not beneficial to anyone. They are irrelevant! Talking about trademark and company this and that..., don’t you see the bad stigma Bitcoin has gained because of its use in the dark market? I️ was talking to my uncle about bitcoin and all he knows is  the negativity surrounding Bitcoin’s NAME! because of the news! You are clearly blind to the facts! This is why I️ know you will be in that bullshit futures contracts fraud ring and then come here and cry! I️ hope you come back and apologize to me when you lose money and realize that company is a fraud! 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:34:23
How were you late? You didn’t have to keep buying. Your money would’ve returned in the next two or three bull runs after your loss regardless. Right now is the best time to get in, everyone keeps on forgetting that we’re still very much in the early stages of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:28:02
Facebook, google and who ever all take people’s fiat money. You know a lot about taxes but know so very little about Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper and what decentralization stands for. If I️’be received education it’s because a central government told me I️ had to or else my parents would be in prison. That’s not decentralization. I️ don’t owe the government shit. I’m not building prisons and paying other people’s debt with my bitcoin. With the fiat, yes. Whatever fiat money they believe I️ have is what they will get. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:50:39

Problems that you don’t even know you have and which I won’t go into details about. Google is your friend. But you’re a “hodl” so go hodl. Build the bubble. Tell everyone that they must hodl and hope to get rich. Nobody must spend anything. Everyone must hodl and ray to allah that they get rich!

I hope everyone hodl fiat and see how it helps inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:11:44
No. It will happen because more and more people are finding bitcoin useful. But, bank accounts are dying. I can buy an entire Wells Fargo database for $5 bucks. That isn’t dying? People are tired of paying banks to protect their money from the banks bullies. If you have me your money to keep safe, would you like me to ask you for money to hire security guards because a bully keeps taking your money from me? The banks bullies are hackers. A man with common sense wouldn’t give a bully magnet his money to keep safe. Bitcoin will continue to rise because people like myself find bitcoin very useful. Not just for a storing value.

Your secondly proves your firstly. You think it was too late because you have doubt. You have no faith in bitcoin. You came into bitcoin thinking it was a get rich quick scheme and this is why you think it’s too late. You wanted bitcoin to make you a billionaire. Very sad. How about starting a business and earning some bitcoin. Be helpful to the bitcoin economy and spend some. Use it for what it was meant to be. A currency! You want to get rich? Earn it! Bitcoin will always go up in value as it helps many many people who use it for the problems it solves. As it helps more people it will gain more and more adopters. Bitcoin is still in the early stages as I have said before.

Shut the fuck up. A tax is a tax regardless of how correct you want to put it. If you want to sell something in my business, I’m taxing you. Tax is fucking tax. But that’s not the POINT! You’re missing the point! The point is you whiners complain about paying TX! to miners but you are ok with IRS taxing you? You will be left with no gains idiots! You might even lose money!

Yous both are wrong. �� Go read satoshi’s white paper please!
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:32:03
Everything is constructive in my posts. I’m warning real bitcoin users. No one wants to pay tax and tx fees. They already don’t want to pay tx fees alone. There will be no point in using exchanges if you have to pay tx, tax and exchange fee. You get the point. And you  very well agree. You know you will lose a lot of money pay tx, tax and exchange fee. You know that is worst than inflation on top of bitcoins volatility. You would be idiot not to agree!
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:44:15
Yes, I agree. Those areas are very much in need of bitcoin due to hyperinflation. Also, third world countries need means to get money into the country faster. When I send fiat through transfer companies it takes about two-three days for the person on the other end to receive money. Suppose they needed for an emergency? They would’ve  died because highly regulated western union failed to get them the money soon enough. Bitcoin solves many many problems, some problems are way too advanced for my understanding but I am aware of the ways it has helped me. That is why Bitcoin will keep rising. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:48:49

@_date: 2017-11-06 18:08:22
Hodl until mass adoption? That is the dumbest thing someone have said to me all year. So by “hodl” people will find bitcoin useful? Or they will also come in to hear someone like you telling them to hodl and become a hodl as well? I wish everyone tucking hodl then! Watch the value of bitcoin disappear. No one will find it useful. The will come and hodl then see there money decrease and move it back into fiat. Let’s all hodl guys. Let bitcoin die. Slow leak. Let’s build a huge bubble and watch it slow leak....

Bitcoin is such a joke and not real to them so leave the companies that trade it alone. Tax the companies because they are the ones selling something that’s not real.

You’re one of the reasons it is never going to be too late to get into bitcoin. This is how more people should be using BTC, as another currency. Bitcoin will have a slow leak if people keep jumping in with the one mission of getting rich quick. If they want to earn money, how about starting a bitcoin business like I did instead of hoping to get rich out of thin air. They’d be doing themselves and the bitcoin ecosystem a big favor.
