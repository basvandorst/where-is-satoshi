Not always. During the Greece deadline, everything fell, except for bitcoin.

This article seems to imply that bitcoin is free from inflation, and would still be even if it became mainstream. Surely that's not true, is it?
My understanding was that inflation happens when the economy grows. More specifically, since I can invest a dollar today and get a bit more than a dollar back tomorrow, a dollar today has more value than a dollar tomorrow. If bitcoin was mainstream, that would still be true, so it would still lose value over time. (i.e. inflation). Is that right?

In regards to oxidation,  I must have been thinking about silver.
In regards to conductivity,  I only meant that gold is a worse conductor than silver and copper, which are less 'valuable'.

So true. I just tried getting my first bitcoins recently.  It took a week to get them.
I tried visiting 2 bitcoin  ATMs. One was no longer there, the other was out of order and has been for a while.
I looked into an online market where you exchange with an individual,  but that seemed so risky and complicated. 
I signed up for an exchange. It required 3 different types of government ID,  and that info was then sent to the government. (Why do they even need to verify my identity?  *I'm* giving money to *them*.) Even though the identity verification was "automated", it took hours.  The next day I deposited real money into my exchange account. It didn't show up in my exchange account balance until the day after that. Then I could convert to bitcoin,  then send it to my wallet.
So it was about 1 week between 'I want to get bitcoins' and 'Yay I now have bitcoins'.

I love how the title says "1000$", not "$1000". The backwards convention ($1000) makes no sense. This way (1000$) is consistent with the order it is pronounced,  and every other unit.

Can you recommend any specific relevant resources to read?

Our monetary system is so silly and circular.
Gold is valuable because people want it. People want it because they think it's valuable.
It's frightening to think that the world's largest and most important institutions spend time and resources digging up a metal which is ductile, an okay conductor and oxidises easily, then they melt it into bars and bury it back in the ground.
