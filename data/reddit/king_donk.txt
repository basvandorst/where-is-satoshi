This is what happens when your away from bitcoin for too long. No clue what this means....
@_date: 2016-04-10 12:04:06
Yes no cloud mining. Either invest directly or use a skill you have to earn some bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 05:31:40
I think you need to have a verified account, but its worth a try. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 12:26:24
There are thousands of places to use you bitcoin. With bitcoin cards like  and other cards you can use bitcoin anywhere you use a card. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:03:59
It seems this is a major overstatement. With bitcoin cards you can use bitcoin anywhere. With this, its very limited right now. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 18:17:10
I use e-coin everyday and all over the world. I have heard good things about some other cards as well.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:52:39
haha... Well my feed is a little funny anyways.
@_date: 2015-12-13 18:20:09
exactly! Existing infrastructure is in place. When I go to US I expect them to accept my EURO Visa card. Bitcoin is now another currency. Whats wrong with that?? Its not like I expect the 7-11 in New Jersey to accept my Euros....
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:15:38
Yes all the bitcoin cards do. E-Coin, Cryptopay, Bitnations card, and all of them. For cashing out bitcoin there is no need for BTM's
@_date: 2015-12-13 18:16:00
I use my  card every day. It lets me use bitcoin everywhere. I am sick of these anti-bitcoin cards people. The payment terminals are there. Lets use them!
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:51:17
 he is looking for an alternative to the Bitcoin Foundation.   could be what he is looking for.  It will be launching later this week!
@_date: 2014-05-18 12:45:45
I think this is a fantastic idea.  A platform open to all to discuss crypto is what is needed.  I have heard there is a group already doing something real similar.
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:55:23
I have heard about Factom. Neat video thanks for sharing! This project is extremely interesting.
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:14:58
Gems is an amazing project.  Good luck!
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:00:46
@_date: 2014-11-23 19:06:34
This is Koinify's first project. I actually think they will become Kickstarter for the crypto world. Gems is being held to a lot of accountablity during this crowdsale. They have to hit benchmarks to get funds released. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 12:54:55
 this is where you can buy Gemz. Over 500 bitcoin sold with 24 hours left in round 1
@_date: 2014-11-30 20:21:25
bitcoin is now used by so few. Its complicated and most people just dont get it. Integrating a Counterparty wallet that doubles as a bitcoin wallet into the Gems app. Gems is built on the idea of viral marketing and rewarding the users for inviting their friends to the network. The more you invite the more Gems you get. Unlike altcoins Gems has value built into the token. Its advertising throughout the network. As Facebook and other social media sites are advertising to the users the Gems app is the same. Unlike other platforms you get paid directly from advertisers to view their ads. Advertisers needs Gems to advertise and will buy them on the market form users creating supply/demand.... Ultimately making a easy and secure way for people to get their hands on crypto/bitcoin with a simple app we all use everyday.

we would be happy to list it and promote it on our site.    PM me if your interested.  
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:55:45
most everyone who has came in the last 1 year has lost money. Its too bad this giant bubble was created. I am very confident bitcoin is going to change the world but maybe not as a currency. Factom, SpaceBIT, Providence, Ethereum, Counterparty, and many other awesome projects have spawned from this. Long live the Blockchain
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:43:37
Providence seems like a fantastic project! Good luck guys I will follow this one.
@_date: 2014-12-29 15:45:10
have you really read their materials  and white paper? I would say this is as exciting as bitcoin itself.  
@_date: 2014-08-07 04:44:14
legislation is sure to be coming soon in the EU.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:06:22
great news! Latin America can benefit greatly from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 12:57:40
  to buy Gemz
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:31:11
You can see the App at work here 
Token Sale is through 
December 30th iOS release. Bringing crypto to the masses.

I guess no matter how legit a project is there will always be haters. I thought the Gems switch to Telegram was brilliant and the right move. If we had to wait till May for the Android someone would have beat Gems to market. Koinify is IMO the most classy crowdfunding I have seen. Majority of Kickstarter projects do not deliver. Gems has every reason to deliver. And yes even $1 million is good for them. I am invested and hope they raise the full $1 million. The more they raise the more chance this project has. Face it people if Gems gets 20000 downloads which is nothing it will be  all time next to bitcoin itself. Lets support projects instead of tearing at them.

Yes there is an option to opt out of ads
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:01:35
interesting article 
@_date: 2014-08-22 19:04:59
good marketing but its 1.5 years from now.  Not likely to happen since they do very little business in btc and altcoins as is
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:04:07
XGEM is the term we will use for exchanges and such because there is already a Gems listed.
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:03:29
there will be the ability to remain anonymous on the network

time for the next level exchanges to come out like Providence.solutions
@_date: 2016-03-09 07:17:50
I think we should start a class action against Coin Desk. Lets make a list of people who were hurt from this.
@_date: 2015-01-10 11:31:41
I dont like all these regulations coming in
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:53:51
without research what do they offer?  why would someone invest?

The great thing about Wirex/E-Coin is you do not need to worry about bitcoin volatility. You can load your card when the price is where you want to convert, and you can re-buy bitcoin later if you like and the price drops. No other card offers this. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 06:54:04
Yes, everyone keeps talking about how this hole team is a piece of work. Hopefully people will stop using them. They do not even have liquid reserves. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 07:19:19
agreed. Lets start gathering a list. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 07:20:52
We had bought tickets as well. Lets get a list going of people to take action against Coin Desk.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:07:08
It sounds like you are asking for a bitcoin debit card, but at the same time not. Are you wanting to pay a bill with btc?
@_date: 2016-03-12 06:21:14
Wirexapp.com said they are about to launch this option to buy bitcoin with PaySafeCard. Should be in next couple of weks. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 07:33:28
this exactly. We need to be vocal about vulnerabilities. If you can break it, break it and then we fix it. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 14:27:15
I would just use a local p2p exchange. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 10:12:53
They were just trolling her. Pretty disgusting in my opinion. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:08:07
I use Wirex.  Good and reliable.  Also the only two way card to buy and sell bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 07:21:07
Very misleading. Withdrawal to PayPal is no big deal. Companies like wirexapp.com allow you to already buy bitcoin with PayPal in 37 countries. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:20:53
great product! I just got my e-coin last week and use it everywhere
@_date: 2015-09-07 07:29:58
its been fantastic. I use it everywhere with nothing but smooth sailing!
@_date: 2015-09-12 07:23:56
There are so many good explorers and wallets I would almost forget about them
@_date: 2015-11-08 06:32:19
I do not think they are dishonest about their rates. What you see if what you get when you load your card. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 08:17:03
I will stick with my e-coin card. No need to support a centralized company like Coin Base. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 06:28:29
You can buy bitcoin through  through Poli and local bank transfer 
@_date: 2015-11-19 09:07:30
@_date: 2016-05-10 06:29:33
I like my Wirex/E-Coin card.  
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:11:54
I believe Satoshi did not even use the word blockchain in his white paper if I am not mistaken.
@_date: 2016-05-03 08:17:33
Looks sub par right now.  What does it provide over Wirex or Xapo? 
@_date: 2015-10-16 23:38:35
great show!
@_date: 2016-05-14 19:37:53
I enjoy mine as well. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:52:59
Some really good deals today!
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:29:53
 is by far the clear winner IMO. I hear they have the most on the market so far as well.
