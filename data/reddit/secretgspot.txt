You're joking, right?  These twats wouldn't be able to get into their own computer with a password 123456!  I think you're so far off the reality scale and have no clue what you're dealing with.   Which medications are you prescribed to?
Do feds give same punishment?  Then why the fuck Charlie Shrem only got 2 years for "supposedly" laundering a million dollars?  Try that with feds money or with IRS, they'll stuff you away for 2 decades plus minimum. 
Get your head out of your ass, son.

I think he's new to Internet!

are people really that stupid?  It's like saying, whoever ate the piece of pie confess and all will be forgiven when reality is that's the trick to catch someone.  No one in their right mind would even be connected to internet since the hack.  I'd have it printed on a piece of paper, fly to Dubai or something and split it into million 10,000 accounts

did they every catch that Mt Gox hacker?
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:43:17
I did that in it worked. I had 1000 coins and after paying 250 coins I was able to get it back.  Took 37 minutes.

LOL! Nice try, mom.
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:32:07
kids today.. you kids been watching way too many cartoons!

Just like Hillary's missing emails and other Clinton files?

see, son.  Money is copyrighted and protected by U.S. Gov't.  You don't want to fuck with families who are running things.  It's probably Feds are the ones who cleaned out the place if it wasn't Bitnex themselves.  Why?  Tax for not using "their" system. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:25:04


you keep thinking that.  What is it with every woman lately uses that to try to offend males?!   Ohh GET A JOB, OOH MOVE OUT OF YOUR MOMS HOUSE, OOOH LIVING IN THE BASEMENT.   Do women say stuff like that because their kids are like that and they assume everyone else is too? 
Anyone who can hack 60 million worth of anything is DEFINITELY not an anon fan living in the basement.  I guarantee anyone with skill like that can easily net 10k a day doing various schemes. 
And  why does everyone assume Suddenly Gov't gives a shit about BTC?!?!  They have 0 invested in it, so they could care less, if anything they'll tell you to keep your money in the Bank next time where it's FDIC insured for 100k.   LOL!
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:06:49
SPOT ON!  What's more retarded is who these idiots are trying to plead with the hacker... OOOOH PLEAAAASE RETURN OUR MONEY!  Bwahahah
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:13:18
they probably aren't insured and just had it on their site for confidence.  Feds DO NOT SUPPORT BTC, get it thru your thick heads, retards!!!!   FEDS WANT YOU TO USE THEIR MONEY aka Dollars! 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:29:36
LOL!  Did anyone figure out what happened to Mt Gox and where the coins go?
@_date: 2014-08-07 09:41:11
I think you're taking this bitcoin craze a bit too much. There will be decentralized currency, but it will not be bitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:26:20
HEEEY HEY HEEEEY.  I want to get paid $80k/year.. who do I need to bad-mouth?
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:22:54
can someone explain to me for the need of so many curencies?  why can't there be just BTC and LTC and that's it.. wtf is the deal with 100 more out there?!?!  What a waste of resources and time
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:29:38
UUUM JAIL TIME FOR THAT FUCK!  Some people lost their entire life savings on this crap.   Yes, it's high risk, however, this guy allowed his "BANK" to have a weakness, well for that he should pay with his time in JAIL!

what goes up, must come down. this spice is to collect all the "noob" investors in one bucket.   I predict drop before halfing to 400 or so mark then recover back into 500
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:56:47
