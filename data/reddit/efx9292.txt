Darkwallet is possibly the second best thing after Bitcoin. Go on guys, long live freedom.

How long has it been like this? The most annoying thing with building hypes like this is that it actually works!

I hope someday we can use bitcoin just like credit card to make purchase, I believe that day is not far from me.

bitcoin will be the new petro dollar
usd is shit and dying/ rmb is too closely controlled to be a world currency
gold is too pain in the ass to move around

And as all real revolutions it will not be televised. The revolution is here.

it is unavoidable trend for merchants to accept BTC payment. No surprise to here this type of news.

bitcoin will make the government accountable for every dollar, instead of printing to abandon
banks will have less controll of scottish government as they cant print and give money to the government

I want to use Shamir's Secret Sharing algorhythm to make a paper wallet in a way some risks are lowered : paper wallet lost, burnt or stolen.
My first idea was to use  with 5 shares and 3 required and then to set in 5 envelopes one share with the secret and one bip38 paper wallet.
But i do not see clearly the benefit of sharing a passphrase versus directly sharing the bitcoin private key.
If someone could clear my mind on the subject

The US doesn't actually control this much of the bitcoin network, but rather 40% of the network is located in the US. This is a very big and important difference.

This is a difficult one because so many people can accidentally send coins to others which were not meant for them in which case you using them could cause a problem. If I was not sure they were meant for me I would hold them safely until I could either trace the person that sent them or someone came to me saying they had accidentally sent them. If I knew they were for me I would more than likely invest in some kind of bitcoin business.

Innocuous enough for now though its the future implications that scare people. 
“We’re looking forward to increasing our involvement in formal working groups as they engage on specific issues relating to consumer protection,” William Wade-Gery, CFPB’s acting assistant director for card and payment markets, wrote in a May 6 letter to the GAO.

Awesome video! In my opinion understanding what is money and why certain things became money throughout history is the most important stepping stone which allows us to understand why bitcoin is such a huge improvement in money

You might want to look into BitShares, Ethereum or Nxt AT for tech that will be able to do this most likely before the end of the year (especially in the case of Nxt AT as I am managing that project and it is progressing very rapidly now).

Vancouver is an awesome city. I haven't been back there since before the Olympics

While the GAO report didn’t specify the issues that should be addressed by the CFPB, fraud and security have been serious problems for some bitcoin users. For example, an exchange based in Tokyo went bankrupt in February after losing most of its users’ accounts to hackers.

Waitin for Wall Street Journal to start publish bitcoin prices

While I applaud this kind of mainstream media and would be perfectly happy if Bitcoin was the cryptocurrency that smashes control of the banks and FED. why is there never much mention of possible successors like NXT etc. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 12:08:24
Thanks for your work. When some good article about this will appear I'll read it as soon as I get a chance.
@_date: 2014-04-30 14:16:57
A little disappointed with the crowd. I guess at some point you get far enough down the rabbit hole to forget what it was like on the other side.﻿

Good project, it can include risks one can try to search btc address owner accounts on web and try to hack it...
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:13:43
Really amazing! I loved it. 
It reminds me of the time when I was a kid and had the dream to be an astronaut Cheesy
Congratulations for your interesting hobby and project!

Are you currently putting all your money into bitcoin?  If you say this, you show you believe it by your actions.  I am putting all my money into bitcoin - I see a possibility of $50-$100+ per coin this year.  Just think, once the "bankers" and hedge funds find out about this, we are going to the moon.

Once my bitcoins are $1,000+ I will be able to pay off my growing college loans and maybe get an apartment, and my first car Smiley

I guess they added it to their spy network of things to watch 
I don't think they need to be everywhere and see what everyone's transactions is but it should be easy enough if they build a blockchain targeting app.

I know BTC is the main story but I bet there will be little mention of alternative crypto in the whole mainstream discussion.
