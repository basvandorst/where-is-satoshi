From the looks of it, the whales are selling.

I hope you’re right. However, I went through all those emotions over the past 5 months and now I’m feeling complacent. The things that has me believing that it will turn around is that we haven’t hit an ATH yet, the Libra coming out, and the halfening next year.

Have you guys been through the previous bubbles before? I was only invested in 2017. I lost a little but held on to most of my coins. I hate the fear of losing on my investment. I bought a bunch of Bitcoin a couple days ago and it hasn’t been looking so hot. I wish I knew what it was going to do.

I buy high and sell low so I can get a tax write off. STONKS.

The major players of bitcoin, especially the guy who started it are already already rich. I’m going to choose to believe that with all the money they have, they wouldn’t be behind a greedy scandal like you describe. Obviously I don’t know the truth, but I do believe that major players of Bitcoin would like to see the long term success of cryptocurrency and would coordinate any move necessary to inspire mass adoption.

I thought the stock plummeted because of Trumps tweets about tariff wars.

Similar concept: if you would have bought a lottery ticket last Wednesday with the numbers 3, 14, 28, 45, 55 R3 instead of whatever numbers you picked, you would be a  multi-millionaire today.

How can you argue that yesterday on Coinbase, we weren’t able to sell when some of us wanted to. There’s even articles about it in the news. We should be able to sell when we want. That’s what’s crazy about the whole situation because when the price tanked, we couldn’t do anything.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:47:08
You should go look and compare. Hit the buy button on both sites. I’ve don’t that a few times now and I’m getting a better price through RH and that’s not including the Coinbase fee.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:55:07
I’ll look into that. Thanks!

You prefer to pay a fee when you have the option to avoid it? And I’m foolish?
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:52:06
That’s a really good thing I think. I was hoping for bitcoin to stabilize and move up a little slower. I’d prefer slower, longer gains versus a faster, shorter one. I think that bitcoin will hit a higher record high of it goes more gradual.

I don’t HODL the wheel while I check bitcoin prices. Tesla’s autopilot does the driving for me.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:56:15
I might be alone in this thought, but I’m worried with how fast it is going up. I wish it were rising slower so it has less chance of popping. I didn’t expect for it to be gaining $1k-$2k per day until months from now. I wasn’t paying attention to bitcoin on the first couple rally’s. Does anyone see this following a similar pattern? Has it ever gained this much in just 6 months before?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:20:21
I just compared the price to buy Bitcoin on both RH and Coinbase. I’m sure this can fluctuate both ways but I was able to buy Bitcoin for less on RH.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:25:46
I been hodling since 2017. So far, I made the right decision to sell at $13k because it hasn’t bounced back yet. It’s on a decline at the moment so I’ll probably be buying back in when it reaches around the bottom.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:26:48
Agreed! Twice to me.

I don’t know much about the other trading companies. Is Robinhood not available in Europe?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:00:04
My guess is that it hits around $10k and then slowly starts climbing again.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:17:01
I’ve been holding since 2017 even through the crash. I upped my investment back in December and again a couple days ago. The main point I’m trying to make is that when Bitcoin starting sinking rapidly yesterday, I was able to get out right in the middle of the sink when it hit $13.3k. It obviously continued to sink much further and I was thankful that I sold when I did. I would have lost a lot more money. But I couldn’t sell my bitcoin from Coinbase so I lost more than I would have liked to. I intend to buy back in, but I don’t think we’ve hit the bottom yet. My guess is somewhere around $10k.

True about not being able to move your crypto off of RH, but that doesn’t matter to me because I’m just trying to buy and sell for profit. To compare, I checked to see how much I could buy Bitcoin from both avenues and RH gave me a better price to buy. That wasn’t even factoring in Coinbase fees.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:35:22
Yeah, it looks like this bubble has popped. Glad I got out when I did. Wish I would have sold closer to the $14k mark but oh well.
@_date: 2019-12-18 02:09:33
I think you should have invested in TSLA instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:18:53
My thoughts exactly! Burn them at the stake!
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:02:01
Sell, sell, sell.  Once it hits 9k it’s gonna tank back down to 8k. Then buy back in cause it’s headed up to 10k and beyond(over months).
