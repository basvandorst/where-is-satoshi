Lol you think a Japanese guy made bitcoin. lololol. obviously not. Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym not someone's actual name. 100% American libertarian creation. 
Also bitcoin will ensure stronger borders. With sound money the American economy will be stronger than ever and their won't be any need for immigration ever again. Bitcoin is going to wreck you libtards.

100% Hillary would have started world war 3 by now if she was president, I guarantee it. 
Libtard media trys to make trump look clueless or dumb, but we all know he has to be one of the most intelligent person on the planet. I can sleep easy at night knowing trump is in charge. It's no coincidence crypto began getting attention after trump became president.

The average yearly salary was also $2500 back in 1913. I now make that in just one week. Purchasing power of the dollar has decreased, but purchasing power relative to income has been really stable thanks to the Fed. It's why the US debt is the safest investment in the world. Go read an actual economics book before parroting horse shit. People like you are why someone like Trump can get elected in this country.

The majority of my savings are in farm land. The rest is divided amongst mutual funds, US debt assets, and blue chip dividend value stocks.
 I've recently bought some bitcoin and bitcoin cash, I'm not a big fan of investing in precious metals so I don't do it, but I find the idea of crypto to be interesting.
Very glad to be born in a country like the US and have the luxury of living in our great financial system.

I do keep USD on hand, but right now is a risk on economic environment meaning the global economy has been booming and investors world wide are willing to invest in riskier assets and take on more risk for higher yields. This is why we are seeing record levels in US equities and also the equity markets of all major economies are at or near all time highs. It would be unwise to be missing out on the higher yields.
The USD, similar to us debt, is a very stable secure asset and is a global safe haven during economic crisis. During a deflationary event the Dollar's purchasing power will shoot up and the wise will be holding a majority of their wealth in USD. During the great financial crisis I was able to liquidate my stocks and from the summer of 08 to late 2009, 70% of my net wealth was in USD (at the time I didn't have a house) and the rest was US debt assets and a little bit in Asian currencies. This is when I was able to take advantage of the high purchasing power of the USD and was able to get into real estate investments for cheap, mainly fertile farm land, and slowly moved back into equities. Of course you can't expect to time these deflationary events, but lately I've been sizing down in some of my equities and increasing my USD holdings, the equity market has been looking over-extended since 2015 and I'd rather be prepared for a possible correction by having USD on hand.
