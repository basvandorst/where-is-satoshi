Good old fashion meme from the boys at r/wallstreetbets 
Thought we could all have a chuckle, but tough crowd

Not to be rude, but you claim his research and studies are used to sell lies. Yet you don’t tackle any of his points or provide information of your own.
I’m not leaning one way or the other but to call his research “manipulation” while your view has no “proof” that its false. Would your comment also be considered “manipulation” ?

I had a good LOL as well. Not sure what country this guy plans on living in where the government is just going to allow this to happen.

I did not say they will take your bitcoin, I said the federal reserve can issue their own coin like other countries have already done.
The federal reserve can absolutely pass a law to ban BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:30:49
This is why bitcoin can’t go mainstream for the average user. This whole thing is a cluster fuck,
You got people saying he posted his key and others saying he dint.
On top of that he has no idea how he lost 1.5 BTC
Imagine if everyone was using BTC, there would be 5-10 trillionsair scammers and lots of broke common people.

I disagree, a 3rd world like Argentina would not resort to a digital currency.
They would revert back to Gold or some sort of precious commodity that can be used for easy bartering. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:23:46
Stop limits! 
Decide how much you are willing to lose, if the price breaks that level you are out. Same with appreciation, set a price you want to get out. Letting it ride forever it’s not a good strategy.
At least set a target, once you hit that target at least sell half position to take some profits.
This is basic investment due diligence.
It’s boggling my mind people are investing tens of thousands of dollars without any proper theory or training.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:36:35
If the government goes bankrupt and the system collapse.
Who the fuck is going to maintain the internet, power plants and all the utilities to keep bitcoin running?
The world will be in chaos, no one is going to give a shit about bitcoin. If time gets tough people are going to trade precious metals.
Don’t be such a autistic piece of shit

Not sure how you got to your conclusion from my comment.
People make trades on emotions, you can you technical analysis to understand how others are trading. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:30:19
Thats right, one is a real thing with intrinsic value and the other is just made up stuff. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:26:15
You hit the nail on the head.
You think the old US and A is going to let thing this ride if it becomes to big?
The Fed could issues their own crypto tomorrow and make bitcoin illegal tomorrow and BTC will be worth zero.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:32:35
Wait for bitcoin to find its bottom, check out trough technical analysis. Lots of people saying $2000-4000
Maybe that’s a good time to buy in, now is not the time.

When you compare a chart like what he has shown it has nothing to do with the underlying asset, stocks, currency, bitcoin... What technical analysis is and meant for is to track the human aspect of trading. What you are seeing is patterns in human nature sure as Fibonacci
You can see direction from bitcoins chart. You hit a all time high, drop, rally that fails to meet previous high, drops, rally again and fails to meet the previous high...
That’s indicates the stock is unable to find support and looking for direction which is downward trend

My question is, with sea of alt coins.
What gives bitcoin legitimacy over other alt coins.
Gold is rarer then silver, Gold has different applications in industry compared to silver.
Besides perception what makes bitcoin more valuable then other alt coin alternatives. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:11:19
It fluctuates to much, imagine if I budget 1 BTC for a vacation. When it comes time to pay 1 month later, BTC drops in value and now I don’t have enough.
The value needs to stabilize for it to be useful on a daily basis. Business would go bankrupt overnight.

No backing to justify it?
Everyone in America who pays taxes backs up that “fiat money” 
Feds print money based on bonds. Those bonds have never defaulted.
To sum up your post. The tax base including you is the backing of the currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:19:22
How many citizens are willing to break the law, what good is bitcoin if you can’t spend it.
You need mass adoption of bitcoin for it to be worth anything.

How is the government going to operate and provide basic functions? 
@_date: 2018-07-15 01:55:43
Lol, why would anyone choose bitcoin over gold if the economy collapsed.
How much of America even knows about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:55:56
Lol 
Every dollar is backed a bond
Government issues bond = 1 paper dollar printed.
Dollars are backed by bonds.
A bond is a IOU with interests.
When you make comments like that make sure you understand how the finically system works first. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:29:10
If thats the answer you want to go with, then Gold will be the next standard. Not bitcoin.

Money is created out of debt, 
It’s a bad system but its the best one we have so far.
If we all moved to bitcoin it would be even worst.
We already did that with gold and it din’t work. It’s a finite supply and can’t expand with the population. 
Inflation is what keeps everything running. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:14:47
Gold standard.
Gold &gt; gold bond aka “gold backed currency”
Current standard.
Bond &gt; fiat money “backed by the bond”
Money in America is backed by Bonds.
Those bonds have value because the tax collected by America’s pays those bonds yields.
As long as America is up and running those bonds are as good as gold.

What cant the US government pay private servers to verify transactions.
Pay per hash rate, not mining for new coins.
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:05:49
Now we are getting somewhere.
So I think we both can agree that bitcoin wont be taking over anytime soon unless there is a melt down like in Venezuela?
In a sense bitcoin is just a store of value, not a real alternative to the USD. In the case of a collapse bitcoin can be used to trade.
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:49:07
The argument is all over the place, so I want to consolidate my idea.
I don’t see a situation where a sovereign nation like America would allow bitcoin or any de centralized crypto to replace the dollar. Allow mass adoption where its tax base could significantly be affected.
I brought up the idea of government backed crypto as the only plausible scenario.
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:06:37
You still live in that country and fall under the rules and jurisdiction. 
You should take a look at what happened to people who owned gold and when America went off the gold standard.
It’s as easy as making it illegal and punishable by jail time. I wonder what the price would do after that news. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:34:26
Bitcoin market cap is 280 billion
US GDP is 18.57 trillion annually.
“Government would have less miners.” At first I thought we were having a serious conversation. 
You yourself mentioned its all about perception, even if bitcoin was more secure it will not beat out the official crypto. They would make bitcoin illegal and the hash rate would just start mining US crypto. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:10:06
Bitcoin security is based on block chain technology.
Now going back to your original comment about fiat money always fails. Bitcoin is secure because it uses block chain to secure the network.
Is it more likely that the US government (if the chose to abandon fiat) would use block chain technology and issue an official US crypto currency. 
The backing of government would  make it perceived as safe and more people would flock to it. In turn that would make bitcoin less secure and it would lose its incumbent spot as most secure great affecting its value. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:27:26
Not just that, even if the government did nothing and let bitcoin take over.
The tax revenue would dry up and America would shut down. No more military, no more police or defence spending.
It would be like mad max.
People don’t understand that you need inflation to keep things moving. This is why we got of the gold standard. Because its a finite amount and cant expand as the population increase.
Most of the bitcoin is owned by only a few people, that already wont work.
