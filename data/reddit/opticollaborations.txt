Why does the article refer to Segwit2x being released?

It's unforgivable that a media outlet like this can peddle such baseless, nameless, third hand, copy paste, unverified horse shit. Until I got involved w Bitcoin never realized what a bunch of useless pawns they were. WSJ included.

What US based exchange recommended if pull coin from GDAX? Or best to keep in wallet and wait for things to get sorted out?

Thanks mate. Cheers.

Are you expecting a rise in price when LedgerX trading starts or do you think this baked into the current price?

It's pretty extraordinary and scary that a couple of statements can bring down the market like this. Makes you think if they really wanted to end the party they could pull the necessary levers to get what they want- whether that is to control as much BTC as possible (which they must do already) or make it very painful for a lot of good people. Frankly I think JD's comments are reckless, irresponsible and reveal the very dark side of the banking system. Scary folks.

Welcome to the darkness. Today's events should remind us that at any time of their choosing the government and its pawns like JD can step in and if not end this party, cause a lot of good, innocent, well-meaning people to get very hurt. He should be in prison.

Exactly. This whole thing makes me want to puke.
