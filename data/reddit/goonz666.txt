Thanks for the real answer first off. Now if only I can catch it this time, unlike in September when I was tipped off to buy but just waited. Also might be a dumb question, I'm a n00b at this, but if bitcoin were to lose 85% let's say. And I only buy $5000CAD. Does that mean I would lose $4250CAD. Or I would lose 85% of the whole value ($9480CAD), so essentially lose everything.

Cheaper than Canadian Bitcoins. My friend works for them and I still use Quadriga. It’s cheaper than Coinbase for Canadians since it’s out of BC. Take a look but I think it’s a much better option.

Why not use Quadriga?

So do you think waiting it out now is a better option? Or just buying what one can afford and HODL it regardless of a 20% or 90% crash?

Yes double coins. Except one will be BTC and one will be a useless Shitcoin.

Honestly thank you for replying. Stocks community on reddit is very secretive (obviously for a good reason) and I can never get help out of them lol.

My uncle in California has been telling me about Ethereum. So it might have some nice value. Thank you!

Ok thank you. I'm in Canada if that means anything. Also not to push into your personal space, but would you suggest that or anything else? Thank you.

Thank you. I actually see this low as the perfect time to invest.
