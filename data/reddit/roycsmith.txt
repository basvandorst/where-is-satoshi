Seems pretty impractical to me, I mean the fees make it cost like twice as much as it's worth unless you're buying KFC for like 50 people

Hi all is well, we are overwhelmed with fud but the future is on the way and nothing can change that, whatever we say, bitcoin goes up and it will continue ... hold!

Keep in mind that price can go up large %s, but can only drop a maximum of 100%. So that 50% drop is equivalent to wiping away 750% of that rise

And still they call teams from crypto projects to give presentations at their HQ. I'm positive MZ will launch Facebook's own currency in less than 18 months.

I agree that 12000 is now a major support line after a recent double bottom BUT currently BTC is trading in a narrow band between 13200 and 14500. One of these will break soon and I have no idea which way. 50/50! I don't see how anyone can justify rediculous figures of either 6000 or 20000 by the end of this month!! Please enlighten us as how you have managed to arrive at these wild figures! I am happy with anything above 20000 but don't see this happening in the short term but maybe by the end of this year but who knows it might be 6000!!
