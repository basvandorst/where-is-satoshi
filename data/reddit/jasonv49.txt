I know the transaction fee sending from Coin base to Polo is very cheap and nearly nothing. Doesn't GDAX own coin base, so wouldn't the transaction fee be nearly nothing as well?

Yeah Mt. Gox was kinda a lost cause... rough to hear that.

Dude, I have been doing this for a while now and I'm only 19 years old! The one thing my young mind has understood about Bitcoin is that "Its never too late!!" I remember back last year when bitcoin was at $1000, I thought I missed the train and it was to late to make money! The thing is it is never to late you want to get your ticket on this one way train as soon as possible. Whether your investing $10 or $10,000 your will always be better off.

That is very true, but the USDT price is 1.003 right now so if anything my BTC is worth more on polo.

"Nearly" also It was mid semester which I had already bought books, paid for a meal plan, paid for room and board(dorm), and paid what I could for tuition. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:25:58
