Here is an example of [a very good comment]( from that I came across a month ago(original [here]( I thought it was very insightful and well said. I think if there's a simple and visually appealing way to present this kind of information to people that are new to Bitcoin, it would be very useful in speading knowledge and helping people understand.

This may not be an issue for you, but using Paypal requires trusting a third party. Paypal can be hacked, coerced, or simply choose to freeze your funds or those that donate (like what happened to Wikileaks).
Paypal would likely not pick a fight with you, but they regularly pick fights with people that are smaller and less known. They're also not required to follow standard banking regulations, request personal information (like resident address and bank information) at their own discretion, and make up arbitrary limits for processing transactions.
The importance of Bitcoin is that a trusted third party is not required for making transactions. There are no gatekeepers. **Anybody** can open a Bitcoin "account" (wallet) in an instant, then send money without restrictions. All transactions forward to a public ledger that everyone agrees to in a P2P fashion.

We would simply be using the same infrastructure our society has in place to regulate existing markets from anti competitive monopolies and collusion. This kind of problem is not a novel one.
Not all regulation is bad. For example Intel instigated a lot of collusion with industry partners to further their own monopoly. Regulation helped make sure that AMD, VIA and other alternatives kept the market healthy. Microsoft manipulated their market very maliciously before getting hit with multiple anti-trust suits. Now we have much better browser alternatives that are more secure. Regulation helped bring innovation back to America's cellular service industry by blocking the ATT/TMobile merger.
When an industry gets big enough, game theory inevitably kicks in and selfish actors rise to the top. I don't see any reason to believe mining pools will act any differently when the time comes.

You can't get your stolen money back in any currency once it's spent, so please spare us the hyperbole.
You can be compensated through insurance, which is a mechanism that works independent of any currency. There's nothing stopping Bitcoin from being insured.

Our society already recognizes the need to protect consumers from unhealthy monopolies or collusion within an industry. Couldn't we simply extend those protections to the blockchain mining industry?
Otherwise when btc gets more popular, whats to stop history from repeating itself yet again? It's been proven many times over that the consumers in a large enough market will always act selfish and short sided, and miners are not exempt from this. Bitcoin has been dangerously close to a few 51% attacks already, and those pools were not even trying.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:24:01
I think if there were to be any positive regulation for bitcoin, it would be to limit the total hashing power a mining pool could hold. Otherwise someone could, through brute force or worse (exploiting the pool mining software) gain 51% control of the network to do an attack.
Edit: Instead of using the downvote button as a personal censorship tool (with is against reddit guidelines), can someone give me an example why you wouldn't want to regulate total hashing power per mining pool? How would you stop someone determined enough to to pool enough resources for a 51% attack? Ask them nicely?

1.) Bitcoin doesn't seem to have high-quality rockstar level marketing materials. Stuff that is easily distributed and digestible, like info-graphics or fact sheets. Stuff that can be mass-printed and handed out, or run through mailing lists, etc.
2.) Same as 1, but for video. Bitcoin seems like complicated, illegitimate play money for nerds that can't throw a football. We need educational media that breaks down the complexity of bitcoin and argues its legitimacy, aimed at the lowest common denominator of people who are extremely ignorant and prejudiced. This is a tough problem that is also shared by the science community.
3.) People think everything revolves around bitcoin, like when the earth was center of the universe. This is wrong and damaging. Bitcoin is a form of crypto-currency, which is an implementation of block-chain technology. Bitcoin is important, but the block-chain is revolutionary, and will lead to many big things. We need to untangle some of these ideas so that each can stand out on their own. 
4.) The most practical benefits of bitcoin are poorly highlighted and appear obscured by complexity. Things like low transaction fees, no third-party gatekeepers, moving wealth between currencies, lower exchange fees; these are things that apply to business immediately and regardless of the politics. There are exchanges like Coinbase that make using bitcoin seem effortless, but too many people still don't understand these solutions exist.
5.) There are thousands of critical solutions for existing currencies that don't (yet) have bitcoin counterparts. There's a flurry of development going on all over the place to fix this, but the flow of information about these projects (and what needs to be done) seems very unorganized. We need places to categorize and filter this information, so people can find the right projects, contribute to the right ideas, and find the right solutions for their problems.
6.) We need to fight irresponsible journalism going for the low hanging fruit. This sort-of ties into points 1 and 2. We need to assemble a list of the most common misnomers about bitcoin, and design info material to debunk them. Something practical enough for people to spam in the comments section of every offending blog like their favorite gif.
7.) We also need to address and put into perspective some of the major controversies, like Mt. Gox. So much misinformation is being thrown around constantly.
8.) This might already exist, but a simple wiki of different bitcoin terminology, like hot and cold wallets.
Those are 6 off the top of my head!
Edit: Added two more!

Your logic has not been validated in any other industry example. It's always in the primary selfish interest to make money. Bigger pools equal more money.
Concern for sustainability tends to lose to greed. I think that's obvious given our current state of society. I just don't understand how you can look at past history and think things will somehow turn out differently.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:07:30
This might be rhetorical since I already know your last  statement is completely false, but can you provide a source that proves those are the design intentions of bitcoin? Or were you knowingly being hyperbolic?

If I put you on a desert island with a gold nugget in hand, what value would it have? Zero. Do you think they just rub gold nuggets on a circuit board and magic happens? Of course not.
Gold has properties that make it valuable inside of certain applications. A peer distributed public ledger also has properties that make it valuable, including digital exchange-of-value without worrying about double-spending or requiring trust in a third party.
I'm sure a lot of people told Ben Franklin and Nikola Tesla that electricity was nothing more than a fancy parlor trick.

No offense, but you have no idea what you are talking about. For income tax purposes, the value of a bitcoin is realized when it's mined, not when sold. If you mined a bitcoin when the price is $500, that is your income. If you later sell the bitcoin for $1000, that is $500 in gains.
This exact scenario is clearly explained in the official IRS statement. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:04:55
Bitcoin is divisible. If a 'whole' bitcoin is worth $500,000, then a fancy latte at Starbucks would be worth .00001 bitcoin. There's nothing wrong with this.

While the above quote is quite inflammatory (and Yishan probably regrets saying it so bluntly), it's also very misleading of his opinion when taken out of context. He's not trashing bitcoin as a currency or technology (he expresses love for dodge), he's trashing the culture around it.

Because why would you want to steal from the cash register once, if you could do it forever with impunity?
Traditional banks lose you money **constantly** through theft, fraud, mismanagement, and corruption. You just never know about it, because (oversimplified) the FDIC quietly replaces it by printing more money.
In Bitcoin, one (obviously) mismanaged institution collapses and drags down a few with them, others gain knowledge from the mistakes and the system becomes stronger overall. In traditional banking, mismanaged institutions fail constantly, their failures are covered up by printing money, and the entire system slowly collapses as inflation increases. See: [Boiling Frog]( metaphor. If you were a crook with an endless thirst for wealth, which scenario would you prefer?

The simplest solution would be to use NFC to share your public wallet address with the register, then the register would send a signed payment request to your device. The payment request is pushed to your device over SSL (using an online proxy) and you accept the payment. The confirmation gets sent back in the same manner. The wallet could even use 2FA by generating a code you have to put into the register, in order for the payment to be successful. It would be like entering a PIN for your debit card, but a new PIN is generated for each transaction. To do this, you would simply need:
* NFC technology to share your wallet address. There's not much harm in this being intercepted.
* An online proxy service that verifies transactions with signed certificates and pushes them to your device over SSL.
* A wallet app that accepts transactions, shares your public address with NFC, and generates 2FA keys.
* A register keypad that accepts addresses over NFC, sends the payment request to your wallet, and prompts you to enter the generated key.
The experience for making a payment would be as follows:
* Bring something to the register.
* Read the generated key on your device.
* Type your given key into the register's keypad.
The worst someone could try and do is intercept your public address and send you a fake payment request. Even if the attacker could somehow forge the certificates that sign these requests, they wouldn't be able to intercept the 2FA key required at the register (unless the register was compromised).
To take this idea even further, you can use a smartcard with an embedded APU that plugs into the register keypad:
* The register keypad would act as a terminal for the hardware on the card and provide an internet connection.
* The card would connect to an online proxy using SSL and receive the signed payment. 
* A 2FA key will be generated on a tiny display on the card itself. The person would input this key into the terminal to accept the payment.
A smartcard would simplify the transaction process without leaking any information over the air. The only point of attack is the register itself, but with proper security practices, a compromised register shouldn't be able to sign malicious payments or MITM the connection between your proxy.

This seems pretty simple to do, actually. You could have a multi-sig wallet that, depending on@ whatever criteria you set, would automatically accept your side of a transaction request. So you could give your phone company one key to your "billpay" wallet which they use it to request a transaction. If the transaction meets all of your set criteria, then it gets accepted.
You could say that, once a month accept a payment request from x address for x amount.

For LoL, each team has various levels of sponsorship, including:
* Shout-outs during interviews.
* Branding on their jerseys.
* Advertisement on their websites.
* Advertisements on their game stream. (usually through twitch using overlays, banner or video ads)
* Advertisements on their media content. (Reality shows, house tours, etc.)
* Branding of the team name. (SK Telecom T1 are 2013 world champions, their team is named after a major phone carrier)
Each team has an owner/manager which handles the sponsorship deals for their teams, independent from Riot Games. If you want to be sponsored through Riot directly, there's less choices. Your main options include:
* Shout-outs on the LCS broadcast. (currently the LCS doesn't air commercials, but video ads are inserted through streaming platforms like Twitch)
* Sponsorship of a tournament (which Riot can officially endorse)
* Sponsorship of an entire "league" (ex. the Coke Zero League is a collegiate circuit).

I think a little bit of inflation is healthy, because we want idle currency to favor spending over saving. That slight bias is what keeps the economy moving forward.
The problem with fiat is that it's completely controlled by a central authority (The Fed), who can arbitrarily choose to cover up bank failures by 'printing' more money out of thin-air. This spikes inflation heavily and leaves the economy vulnerable to the whims of a third party.
The great thing about Bitcoin, is there's no third party in control of the currency. If banks play fast-and-loose with the rules, nobody is going to step in and bail them out. Governments can issue IOUs, but unlike the problems with handling physical gold in the past, holding IOUs offer no real advantage over Bitcoin, so people will rather have the Bitcoin.
Fractional reserve banking can happen on top of bitcoin, and when it's done poorly, no government can step in to save them by printing more bitcoins. Case in point, Mt Gox.

Limited supply. Based on the finite number of bitcoins that can be mined, versus the volume of other currencies being exchanged on a daily basis (or just USD), for bitcoin to adapt to that volume of trading means the price **has** to go up due to scarcity. How much, though, is where the speculation rests. Is it $10k, $100k, who knows. It's extremely likely more than $500.

They didn't eat the loss, their insurance company did. Yeah that's right, banks have insurance against theft/fraud. The cost of which they pass on to both you and me, one way or the other.
Bankers of all people are not in the business of approaching your situation with charity. There's a lot of good places to go and educate yourself on how the finance and banking system works. There's probably a few good subreddits too.
Edit: To be clear, the money the theif stole did not magically teleport from their hands back to you. The money is gone. The banks paid you back with different money, that came from somewhere else.
