Yeah 83k now. No price movement, no post on r/all. Must be bots. Or is there some mention of r/bitcoin on some mainstream-ish media right now?

Very interesting read! It'd be great if people found a way to create jobs out of mining farms. At what temperature do miners operate? If they're hot enough, and with a large enough mine, he could run thermal baths (and the obligatory hotels). Given the preserved nature it would make for a nice and cheap holiday destination. ��

Horses did physical jobs and were replaced as soon as machines became physically superior in every aspect. Humans do intellectual jobs which require learning and adaptation and will be replaced as soon as artificial intelligence becomes superior in every aspect. This is starting to happen (computers have largely replaced traders for example, just off the top of my head) and the transition will be complete sooner than you think. It's certainly a great thing but the economy will inevitably be massively disrupted.

Technically correct :)

This. Bitcoin is an amazing project, you don't need hyperbole to make it look good. OP's premise is correct, he just needs to not sound like a lunatic. Predicting an apocalyptic system failure makes you sound like these guys who build bunkers under their house (btw central banks and governments have more tools than ever before to avoid protracted recessions at the end of economic cycles). And using the phrase "big banks" makes you look financially illiterate, which won't encourage people to take financial advice from you. To be clear I agree with OP's post, I just find the delivery super cringey.

I don't agree with the article's conclusions, but the facts are the following: referring back to the fundamental difference between assets with inherent value (stocks, real estate, comodities) and assets with abstract monetary value (bitcoin, gold, fiat), it follows that the price of the former is much more difficult to manipulate than the latter.
If a market participant wanted to manipulate the price of a stock down, he would end up losing money pretty quickly as he's selling something at a price below its fair value (the fair value of a stock would be based on the company's income, which the holder recieves a share of). Manipulating the price of a stock towards overvaluation is easier, but in the long run it's also unsustainable, because other market participants can estimate the fair value of the stock relatively easily (people get it wrong all the time, but at least not by orders of magnitude). As a long-term stock holder, provided you didn't buy the stock when it was overvalued, you don't really care about its day to day price. The stock you own earns you a share of the company's income regardless of the price it's being exchanged at on the NYSE.
Now, what the article fails to consider is the very real value of monetary assets, and the fact that bitcoin is still in its infancy. I recommend you this [excellent article]( about why monetary assets have value and where bitcoin is in its "life cycle". It's a 45 min read but it's well worth it.

To be fair it's easier to make this mistake when the price you are looking at changes by orders of magnitude on any move. Bitcoin returns are more intuitively expressed as 2.5x rather than +150%.

The ECG picture is inverted with respect to both the y and x axis. Oh and I don't care for bcash. This joke has gone on for too long, let it die already.

Depends on the amount of available liquidity on the other side of the trade (people shorting btc), which should in general be sufficient if you're trading on a major platform. But yeah last time I checked Bitmex reserves the right to force you out of your position if it becomes too large (which would be based on absolute size rather than % gain). You should probably focus first on not getting wiped out though. ;-p

As opposed to cash-settled. Bakkt futures holders will receive actual bitcoins upon expiration of their contracts instead of the USD equivalent of virtual underlying bitcoins.

Let me introduce you to the wealth tax. Many countries have it and it is extra ridiculous for crypto because you're taxed for the whole year on the value of your holdings at market price on, say, 31st December. If there is a spike on that date and your portofolio crashes on the 1st of January, fat chance.

Also the site fails to report that a total of [14 trades were made]( during the whole trading session. 14 trades. That's less activity than the deadest shitcoin exchanges out there. Institutions aren't buying anything and this article is pure clickbait.
