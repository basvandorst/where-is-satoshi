Holy hell; PC master race ftw, but damn that is a good deal, and specific to Bitcoin! :D

And so, the IS GENTLEMEN becomes the HODL.

Nowhere, it's Photoshopped.

Does not work for WWU (Western Washington University).
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:49:09
This looks pretty clearly photoshopped to me.

Commenting for later use.
@_date: 2015-02-07 10:14:52
It's true though; first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then hurr durr.
Just you wait.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:29:41
Ahhhhh wow, right, i totally forgot the whole part about them stalling. Good context, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:54:46
I love how fucking dark this string of comments is and how i have no fucking idea how serious any of you are.
Oh Bitcoin people :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:50:13
What the fuck is this and why do i find it so funny.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:33:00
You make good points.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:10:49
WOW. That guy knew things. That's amazing that he could predict so much that really applies to current times.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:49:30
Because they got fucked over from a sneaky angle that was supposed to be covered by help. They unceasingly destroyed a huge number of enemies when they were ludicrously outnumbered, with no signs of being defeated until that point. The real story is amazing and awesome while that movie was fucking retarded.
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:57:51
Holy poop, when you ask random people to do your work for you, you don't treat them like that...
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:32:23
Careful with this guys!
I like it, but if people start getting tipped with bitcoins often enough for posting funny things, it may get pretty immature in here..
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:52:50
[Fairly normal .jpg]( but i know what you mean, that's why i said "normal", i know that 'normal' for BTC isn't exactly stable - but 'normal' sure as hell isn't spiking to 260 USD and plummeting to 70...
...in two days.
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:12:51
Wow, seems pretty daunting, but i'm not worried, just takes a bit of reading up, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:19:47
I.....just....why though? This is blowing my mind
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:08:53
Ah i read about this, it seemed like a solid idea, thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:29:27
Thanks a lot! I found [this]( too if you didn't already see it, it was kind of hidden...but it all makes sense now, it's a cool idea.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:28:32
That's really unfortunate..that's going to have to change for BTC to really take off :/
But thanks, i'll get on the really secure wallet methods
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:50:38


Haha ;)
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:41:30
Thanks, i'll get on that authentication. And you mean don't leave the BTC on Mt. Gox? Or any wallet not entirely secured at all?
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:20:39
But it's so elaborate..i mean...idk i'll just let it be.
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:22:18
Okay what the hell, i keep seeing small references, what is this??
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:03:35
Makes a lot of sense to me! Any recommendations on good secure wallet methods or how-to's?
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:22:35
I'm losing my shit to this, oh god yes why is it so funny??
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:49:59
Thanks, is there a place to see the trend of bitcoin worth, ideally in a real-time graph? I'm gonna look it up but i'm busy, if you have helpful sources easy to link, that'd be awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:22:49
Lol, true ;)
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:58:44
Why would he be butthurt...
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:53:30
With the volatility right now, it'd be outright ludicrous to measure in BTC...
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:58:26
Please help me out.
Am i stupid? How does this work? I have no wallet information on my Reddit account, how could anyone possibly tip me BTC? I feel dumb...
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:26:56
I just don't like the dramatization of this post; this isn't a crash, it's BTC being volatile as hell as per usual- i know that and i'm just an average guy, an owner of less than half a Bitcoin and too broke to really participate in the currency (although i'm doing what i can).
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:25:30
Change? No, 'add' is the correct word. Both those ads should go/stay up.
I for one, laughed my ass off at the shitty MS Paint 'magic internet money' ad.
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:07:50
That's what i mean...like....it's real, but it's not worth anything is it? So you can just...download as much as you want?..
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:03:25
This is NOT a big crash. Look back less than 30 days, it was in the same place.
@_date: 2013-10-20 19:03:20
Very, VERY possible. Again i would be surprised if something like that WASN'T the case.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:36:48
I don't understand how that post could possibly link a man named 'Ross' with Silk Road, like really, assuming this is just some guy; it's just some guy who wants an experienced IT guy.
Explain, anyone?
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:26:59
Holy fuck how elementary, you have got to be kidding me???
I don't even know how to respond to the prospect of such a ridiculous notion.
Nor can i comprehend how SR wasn't shut down in a month given this enormous of a fuck-up.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:01:26
We may as well be ;)
...actually mathematically that is preposterous. Lol
