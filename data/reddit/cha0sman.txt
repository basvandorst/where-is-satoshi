And that can be implemented, outside of the bitcoin network. To have off chain transactions in the bitcoin protocol, where auditing is pretty much impossible, defeats the entire purpose of even having a blockchain to begin with. Personally I am not opposed to what you are suggesting, I just don't think it should be in the bitcoin protocol. It should be a separate network that runs on top of bitcoin. Kind of like how credit card networks work.

The exemption applies **only** to information supplied to the government by individuals or private business firms.   
  


  
The consent of two parties to break the law, does not nullify the law.   
  


  
This would no way have any impact or damage the government. All  federal court auctions are done through the US Marshals. (Barring a few with a special court order.) Whether it is through a Writ of Execution or what have you. One auction is not going to impact the entire court system. I don't even think that Mr. Draper would even have a cause of action to even sue the government. I could be wrong on that..   
  


  
I am repeating myself, I know, but the exemption only applies to information supplied to the government by individuals or private business firms. If Draper submitted paperwork for say regulatory purposes then yes that would fall under 4. The winning price of an auction is not Mr Draper's data, it is the government's.   
  


  
I am not a lawyer, however I do purchase money judgments and enforce them on my own behalf.   


  
One may call it curiosity, another may call it auditing the government's financial income through the selling of seized assets. In any case curiosity is actually a legitimate interest. All government activities no matter how small are the public's interest. If it wasn't for curiosity, a large number of the government's scandals would have never been uncovered.

OK, think what you will. The fact still remains that your analysis is extremely flawed and deviates **very** far from set precedent. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:41:51
Well in this instant case, wire fraud could be one of the charges brought..  
18 U.S.C. § 1343 provides:
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. If the violation affects a financial institution, such person shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.
  
  
Then i guess legal theory you could look at conversion.

That is actually very doubtful.  
  is out of the question as   
1) there is no trade secret information.  
 2) There is no  financial information obtained from a person being disclosed. 
  
3) If you look at case law precedent:  "Commercial or financial matter is "confidential" for purposes of [Exemption 4] if disclosure of the information is likely to have either of the following effects: (1) to impair the Government's ability to obtain necessary information in the future; or (2) to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained." **National Parks and Conservation Ass'n v. Morton**, 498 F.2d 765, 770 (D.C.Cir. 1974); see also **Frasee v. U.S. Forest Service**, 97 F.3d 367, 371 (9th Cir. 1996). 
 Exemption 6 out of the question if it were a corporation or other type of legal persons by definition they do not get exemption 6. Even if the winner was a natural person, there is nothing of privacy being given away.  Even IF there was, again there is precedent. Again, we are not seeking medical records, bank account numbers or even balances of individual bank accounts.     
"Exemption (6) protects only against disclosure which amounts to a 'clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.' That strong language 'instructs us to 'tilt the balance [of disclosure interests against privacy interests] in favor of disclosure.'"   
**Washington Post Co. v. Department of Health and Human Servs.**, 690 F.2d 252, 261 (D.C.Cir.1982) (quoting **Ditlow v. Shultz**, 517 F.2d 166, 169 (D.C. Cir.1975)).

Yes, sometimes not in this context though. This is a sale price of an auction not the unit price of a service or good to the government. That makes it the government's financial information, not the auction winners.
  
  


  
That is not how the exemption works. The financial information must be information that the person provided to the government. Not how much something the government sold. The public has a right to audit the government.


  
Not true. If he provided the government with some sort of trade secret like an algorithm to valuate sure that would be exempt. The winning bid of an auction is not a trade secret.

Probably to cover their own asses. 1) Karples was on the bitcoin foundation board.  2) Mt Gox approached key members of the bitcoin foundation, and proposed essentially that they conspire to commit fraud among other things with them.  3) Given the above and that they are headquartered in Washington DC,  they probably consulted their legal team. Legal probably saw this as a way to do the right thing -- morally and legally. They probably saw it as a way to protect the bitcoin community also.
@_date: 2014-10-08 04:48:11
I kind of tend to think that it is without choice. Off-chain transactions wouldn't be handled by the bitcoin protocol. That is more of a third party solution, which still can be implemented by said third party and does not need a change in the bitcoin protocol.   
 
But relying on third parties to do that and in the interim not making changes to the bitcoin protocol/network is suicide.   
Hence, to prevent network degrading, it needs to be implemented.

Government auctions for contracts.. And the entire record is not exempt. Only line item pricing..and only sometimes. Like in land leases because at the end of the lease, there is going to be another auction. I am not going into any more detail. Go on west law or lexis and read up on case law. Don't just read the conclusions read everything. See how the law was applied and why. You will understand why I am saying what I am saying.
@_date: 2015-05-07 14:20:02


Or maybe the way that difficulty is adjusted, except, based upon the number and size of the transactions. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 01:21:18


 
Absolutely wrong.. Banks don't exist for the purpose of checking accounts. Banks exist to borrow and lend money.  Things like interest bearing savings accounts, CDs, et al. I can see still existing and coinciding with bitcoin. A big purpose of any of those accounts are so that banks are able to lend out said monies. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:21:59
I could do the same thing with fiat 24/7 and the person could have the money within 10 minutes using a wire service like Western Union or Moneygram. Yes, I know it is expensive, etc.

I don't think you understand. Of course the blockchain doesn't work that way. Neither does cash..But if I were to give someone cash and tell them to buy be XYZ, however, they went ahead and purchased ABC for themselves or someone else. That would still be conversion or theft.. Am I getting that cash back? Probably not.. Would I still be able to press criminal charges and/or bring a civil suit? Yes.  The same would apply with bitcoin..  
  
Bitcoin does not avert the rule of law.   
  
If you own the rights to something, it is yours.   
  
If you own the rights to a certain amount of bitcoin and you have the private keys, you own it and are in possession of it.   
  
If you own the rights to a certain amount of bitcoin and someone else has the private keys. You own it, but a third party is in possession of it.  
  
  
Why would you think any differently?

That is kind of like saying, if I use etrade.com, I don't own the stocks that I purchased..    
Just because something is not in your possession doesn't make it someone else's. If you own a rights to something, in the sense of the law, you own that. If at some point the possessor were to give or sell that property to another therefore depriving the rightful owner of that property, that is called [conversion](   
  
Though I do understand what you are saying~~, I don't see third party possessors~~..

@_date: 2015-05-29 15:27:04


 
Honestly, I would love to know how you actually think that? You are literally suggesting to use the power of the government to force companies to give up their source code of programs that the government purchases the license to use to.   
  
So what's next? If the government purchases a software license they should give up all the encryption keys they have in their possession or how about the data for other companies?  
  
edit: clarification of purchasing license to use
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:53:33


Be careful with that, if it is your business. For any type of surcharge you are required to give visa and mastercard a 30 day notice before you start charging the surcharge. And it is against the operating agreement on both Visa and Mastercard to add surcharges to debit cards, even if it is processed using "credit".

True, but the verification service companies are a lot of the times still required to comply with the FCRA. The companies that maintain the information aren't required to get your permission. However, a company that wants to furnish that information from the company is required to get your permission, sometimes they don't have to get your permission if they are entitled to it through statutory means.

Correct, however what I am saying is Coinbase's terms of service says they may have to furnish your credit report. Because those data services are considered consumer reports/credit reports under the FCRA, and because the FCRA also governs the furnishing of those reports Coinbase could have been just covering their own asses.  
  
 Heck who knows, they could be furnishing credit information for another purpose. Like if a person buys bitcoins and then their check bounces. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 07:11:34
Regarding the government transactions..honestly no idea. They are supposed to follow the operating agreement but who knows. Regarding gas stations,etc. From a consumer standpoint this will seem like semantics and it is sort of but gas stations don't charge a surcharge they offer a cash  discount. Its easy for a gas station to do that vs say a 7-11 as a gas station only has up to what 5 products? Surcharges are normally charged as a percentage of the total. But all in all it is just a loop hole.  But I mean you can file a report to visa if you do see a violation.

No.. the entire purpose was to bypass the **central banking system**. Not to get rid of banks 100%.. There is a HUGE difference between the two.   
  


 
Ok? And? A corporation's sole purpose of existing is to make money for it's investors. It is a free market, its not like someone is putting a gun to your head and making you bank there. If you don't like it speak with your money.  
  


  
Clearly you aren't thinking big picture if you think that banks as lending institutions will cease to exist. Again, as I said before, maybe checking accounts will cease to exist, but the banks will not and should not. The central banks yes they will cease to exist.  
  


Maybe you should rethink what you are saying..You are telling me, that people won't have an interest in say:  
Looking for a way to gain interest on their money that is just sitting around?  What is the easiest way to do that? Lending..   
Are they going to lend the money themselves and take a huge risk? Hell no. So what do you do? You invest your money into CDs or a savings account. With CDs you can't touch the money for a specific amount of time with a savings account you can. The latter has a lower interest rate than the former.  The banks use that money to lend out and pay interest in return.  
Call the lending institutions of the future whatever you like. But the fact remains that if it walks like a duck and it quacks like it a duck, the chances are..it is a duck.

I guess it is not necessarily a litmus test, as determining fair use and what does count as a parody is more of equitable relief.   
  
  
  
One of the main aspects is for a court to determine if an attempt to usurp the market of the original work is being made.   
  
Meaning, what is the main objectives of the new video. Basically why was the video actually made? Was it to spread the word about something else like a competing product, were you trying to get people to look at another product, etc? Once that is established, there are other things that need to be examined. Like the artistic merit and the literary value of the derived video. Meaning unless you meet a high bar of political or social value(and no this video does not even come close to that high bar), you will fail that test.   
  
But if the video does pass the test.   
  
If the video is deemed not as "not funny" and/or does not have any merit on what is brought to light artistically and how that it is related to the original, you will lose a fair use case.   
  
  
  
   
Lets not kid ourselves here, this is not a parody. If you *truly* believe it is a parody, then you don't know what a parody actually is..  
If you truly believe it is a parody, why don't you host it on facebook or where ever. When a DMCA take down occurs file a DMCA counter notice. Then you can see for yourself that no court would consider that a parody after the injunctive relief hearing.

Yes and no. The federal government can create a regulatory scheme, *but*, if an individual state wanted to make their regulations stricter than the federal government's then it is free to do so. But, why give more power to a centralized federal government?   
  


  
Well a senator, right now, is only a representative of the state's citizens. No one has actually represented a state since 1913, with the ratification of the 17th Amendment.   
  
Maybe if the states legislature's interests were actually represented, we wouldn't have so much disparity.   
  
Even so, the states shouldn't give up any power as the federal government is supposed to answer to the states. We were never supposed to have an all powerful federal government in the first place. The expansion of the federal government is actually pretty recent and all started with a rogue decision of SCOTUS with Wickard v. Filburn.

 Analogous to the scenario I am suggesting would be: say I hired a body guard to protect me and my family, and then that very body guard turned and murdered me and my family...

No offense but I don't think you understand what libel actually is. It is not as if coinfire is accusing you of anything. They are reporting on what the documents say, not just blatantly saying oh cryptsy did X and cryptsy did Y.  Even if *you* don't know about any subpoena, how can you say that the entire company doesn't know? (Forgive me as I have no idea what your position is with Cryptsy)   It is very possible that if the feds even communicated with the company, given the sensitivity of the investigation, they have only communicated with the company attorney and the CEO. Everyone else could be out of the loop until such time that it isn't a legal risk or who knows. Just putting scenarios out there.

Bitcoin was created because of the failure of *central* banks aka the government banks not banks in general. If bitcoins are massively adopted,you will see banks that offer CDs, savings accounts, etc as they will be interest bearing accounts. Monies will be used for lending, just as banks have always done since early roman times. I never understood why people think that things like MasterCard and Visa are competitors to bitcoin. One is a credit network the other is a currency. If bitcoin is adopted by the masses, you will be using the bitcoin payment network to pay your visa/MasterCard bill.

You don't have to take the toll roads. You do understand that the Parkway and the Turnpike are "private roads" right? If you don't like traveling the private roads then take the public roads like route 206, 202, 1 &amp; 9. 
  
Also a very big portion of Northern NJ is beautiful starting from say Haskell or Wanaque all the way west through western Passaic County, Morris County, Sussex County, &amp; Hunterdon County.  
  


  
Have you ever had NJ water? It sounds like you really have no idea what you are talking about. Ever hear of the Wanaque Reservoir? It was created because Anheizer Busch loved the taste of the water from the mountain springs.. but the mountains were too far away from the area they were looking to build. They pretty much lobbied the creation of the reservoir, for the longest time, it was actually the largest man-made reservoir in the world.    
The water is also a reason why NJ bagels are so good. Actually it is also the reason why Thomas' english muffins are created in NJ.

The thing is bitcoin can not match those payment networks yet. I really think that those two networks will work to integrate the blockchain.   
  
But I was more of using those two payment networks as more of an example of lenders rather than trying to explain that with a credit card, there is a bank that is lending money, etc etc.. It probably wasn't the best idea, but, essentially i was trying to simplify things.

Firefox OS is **VERY** new, developers need to weigh out if it is worth their time to learn the OS. Though it looks like it pretty much uses HTML and JavaScript and it's variants(looks like JQuery?).  
Developers still need to learn the OS's APIs and its limitations etc.  
  
From a very very quick and dirty look, I could see someone developing a bitcoin client(wallet) as a HOSTED app(as opposed to a packaged app that resides on the phone which would mean that the wallet file would reside on someone's server). For now though, as said, you could use blockchain.info on the mobile browser.

It is OK to theorize and have an idea. It just gets concerning when essentially the same idea is brought up by the same person. And that person has a big say in what the future of Bitcoin looks like.  
Not to say that he doesn't have good ideas. In my opinion it means that the ideas need to be more closely examined.

* [Freezing BitCoin addresses by regulating miners](  (April 17, 2011)

Sometimes a diagnosis could look like something malicious but in the end turns out to be legit. The lines of communication with their customers needs to be improved. Even small updates like "we apologize we are currently having difficulties. Please be patient as we investigate and remedy these problems."Acknowledgement that there is a temporary problem does help put *some* peoples minds at ease. tl;dr It is OK to wait to give a full explanation after the problem is resolved because you don't want to spread false info.
