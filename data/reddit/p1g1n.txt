I don't get why this matters? Paying capital gains tax means you gained some capital, which is always a good thing.  
Big Brother's gotta earn their share.

I think this is VERY different. Now mining it is actually a very profitable business.  
  
It makes sense for Hashflare to sell the hashing power rather than mine because it literally eliminates all the risk for them.  
If people are willing to buy a one year contract for more than the cost of the hardware used to mine, _in advace of actually mining_, then Hashflare spends virtually no money for that hardware. Additionally, they can hodl all that new Bitcoin.  
Oh, and let's not forget the 20% "maintenance" and electricity fee.

That's brilliant! Thank you so much. I'm  actually in the process of starting up a mining operation right now, cloud and physical, and need to find out more about these laws. Any helpful tips?  
edit:  
Also yes, I agree doing both is a great idea. Dont forget about altcoins either.

Thanks for your honest opinion

Honestly, I have to thank CryptoNick on Youtube. It's because of him that I got into this.

The most secure and private way to transact with Bitcoin is to run your own, personal, full-node. This means you verify transactions by following *your own consensus rules*, for *your own wallet*, and append them to *your own blockchain*.  
The bitcoin network network is made up of all the full-nodes that share common consensus rules. Anyone trying to take over Bitcoin will have to change the existing consensus rules, essentially forking and creating a new currency.

I'm definitely going to research that.  
  
And what about incorporating the mining company? Are there any benefits or even a necessity to form an LLC and register in a specific state?  
  
thanks so much btw. Can I pm you?

tldr: Basically you can place orders on gdax exchange (from Bitcoin) with a fee of 0% for a maker and 0.25% for a taker, and at the spot price.  
  
Just be prepared and keep some USD on GDAX. Remember it takes about a week for bank transfer into GDAX.

I've already transferred money from them into my hardware wallet

Those are some excellent sources, thanks!  
  


Can you perhaps elaborate on those differences?

Exchanges that are regulated by a tyrannical government, at the point of converting from/to fiat, can most certainly be compelled to support only coins approved by the government.  
  
Although by then, everyone would have moved on to another currency.

They receive capital upfront and in one year they profit off the contract price, the "maintenance fee", and end up with free mining equipment.

Worth it, yes. Safe, no idea after NiceHash. Something about eggs and baskets I think.  
Overall it is a decent way of making money, even if you only get half of the projected revenue due to Bitcoin bursting or mining difficulty increasing exponentially (although not enough hardware is being produced to make that likely).  
As with any investment, diversify. 
  
Some assumptions are about to be made as well as faulty, late-night logic:  
Mining can also be considered hedging your bet because if the price of Bitcoin were to drop, not only are you still mining Bitcoin, but the mining difficulty actually decreases because miners are leaving the network for more profitable currencies, leaving you with more Bitcoin to earn and hold until the rebound.  
  
Also, as you mine you earn Bitcoin, and although with a 5 month ROI you might have missed out on some of the potential growth by holding, you recoup part of that loss by holding the Bitcoin mined *AND* you still have 7 months more to mine.

You're right that the hashing power is going elsewhere, but this has been a "power struggle" so to speak and I don't think it'll be over any time soon. Bitmain ain't going nowhere and we all know they're all about Bitcoin Cash. Let's not forget, Bitmain pre-mines their ASICs before shipping them out to customers and all those fresh ASICs are going towards Bitcoin Cash.  
That's not to mention the other contracts Hashflare offers such as zcash, scrypt, dash, and ether.  
  


Truthfully, I think it's a reliable way of securing a passive income through Bitcoin. And yes, it will be consistently more profitable than holding because although it seems like it, there will be tough times ahead for Bitcoin (I really hope not) and when that happens I'll still be mining and profiting while others will regret not locking in profits at peaks.  
  


The life-long contracts that people bought in good faith was terminated and people had no recourse.  
This terrifies me! But now, especially with the NiceHash incident today, I will be withdrawing my earnings as soon as they're available.

Short term, confusion scares away new investors.  
Long term, Bitcoin is the ONLY Bitcoin. Hopefully other, bigger exchanges, catch on.
