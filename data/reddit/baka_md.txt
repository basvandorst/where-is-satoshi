Dude 28 hours ago I bought an ATH at like 3450.
Not feeling a drop of regret yet
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:14:06
Took me two days
What happened 
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:24:28
We've been holding pretty steady in the 4000-4100 mark. 
I'd buy, I say we're due for another spike. That's just a bag holder's opinion, but most corrections don't start with 24 hours of sideways. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:58:01
Same, I'm not worried. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:19:48
It gets better man, this is one of those things you'll look back on and face-palm for sure, but we've all got those.
 Your face-palm is just a lot of $$ :p 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:13:51
I have no plans to do this ever again. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:50:37
How fiat works right now 
'this is worth 1 dollar because 1 dollar is worth 1 dollar and it' s backed by a bunch of planes and bombs and also some rich dudes'
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:17:11
But how can I afford genetically modified cat girls if I spend it all on nukes? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:10:52
End of September?
Boi, four days ago it was 3450
This motherfucker has another 10 days

Why are people against magic internet money?
I'm glad to own magic internet money that can also be exchanged for a hefty sum of regular money if I feel like it
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:37:46
You mean when it crashes back down to 7k?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:28:44
It wasn't a big drop it was just fast as fuck haha
Like a vertical line down. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:30:46
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:29:45
We're up boys
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:18:11

You're ridiculously late. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:02:45
Bitcoin -&gt; Monero -&gt; new Monero wallet -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; local bitcoin for cash -&gt; buy shit with cash
It's really that easy. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:30:26
Some day. 
If anyone tells you they know when they're smoking crack. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:51:29
It'll be back in a couple of days, don't worry about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:58:04
Thanks for sharing. 
I wish you good luck in ~~the wars to come~~ your future crypto endeavors. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:09:51
I bought at 3800. 
Won't lie I got a little scared that day, it was hovering, then bam 4k
I only wish I had more money 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:33:13
One can do that. You are welcome to not use Visa and use an alternative. 
You said Visa was like a government, which was false. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:51:30
I think it's called Monero
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:57:19
Tear down governments and replace them with the only thing that has ever worked in the past. 
The free market baby. Ancapistan by 2050.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:52:49
Send 1k of it to me 
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:29:17
Buy. People have been begging for dips since it was 100 bucks.
If you believe in bitcoin just buy it and hold it. It might dip, it might crash, but it will always go back up and go back higher. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:25:19
Nuclear powered, I like it. 
The invisible hand provides a solution yet again! 
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:51:31
Can we get a survey? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:39:49
Nothing like a random dip to get the buyers going again :p
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:46:08
We are coming up with a free market solution. 
For your statement to be true OP would have to be saying Visa needs to be outlawed or something. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:50:16
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:37:29
Such a good answer
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:52:24
Yikes, not good 
Waiting for bank transfer to be approved so they've got me by the balls here
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:58:40
Use Gemini.

I also forgot to mention that because the US is in crippling debt, the validity of the federal reserve is questionable. 
Just to be clear debt works differently for governments (they could further rape taxpayers to get their money if they wanted) but it's still incredibly backwards - the point of the federal reserve is to have fiat so you see why them having negative money sort of negates them. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:15:20
Please leave cryptocurrency and never come back 
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:17:34
If you spend the next month waiting for the dip you're gonna have a bad time.
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:09:19
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:17:58
What in turnation is up with this drop? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:10:02
Lite coin or vertcoin for cash, bitcoin for billion dollar transactions. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:47:25
Here's how the US banking system works. 
The US government prints however the fuck much money they feel like. This money is worth money literally only because the government says it is - that's what the Federal reserve is, it 'holds' money so that way people believe it's worth something. 
Confused yet? It gets better (worse). 
This money is given to banks, who are trusted with the valuable job of distributing this money. Theoretically, this should work because the government would keep them in check. As we saw in the 2008 crash, the government not only doesn't keep them in check, they actually use taxpayers money to bail them out when the free market decides that the banks are garbage. Everyone got fucked except the government and the banks. On top of this, because they print infinite money, your money is worth less every year :) 
Learning about the federal reserve was what took me from libertarian to anarcho capitalist. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:38:33
Monero. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:46:44
Using Visa is voluntary. 
Government is not. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:55:49
I think he means because they're hopelessly authoritarian. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:58:09
