Looks like it's out of control again, place your bets now - at what point do the exchanges crash?
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:39:31
It's almost at 9,900 now and rising fairly quickly, so I'd say right now to make a little, or leave it for now and see if it goes back down.
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:07:46
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-17 09:59:51
I'm talking if it hit something like $100,000 or more. It's basically $9,000 now, so no fees or whatever tax I may need to pay would equate to an actual loss as such. But yes, ideally it needs to be going straight from my Trezor to the exchange to be able to sell, I was just curious if these "stablecoins" can act as a placeholder for fiat if my theoretical event did occur - I wasn't aware that stablecoins themselves could crash - thanks!
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:58:25
Does this work with your fiat Coinbase balance? Ie. you wouldn't need to transfer your money out of Coinbase after you, theoretically, sold some BTC?
@_date: 2019-07-11 08:06:25
Sold at 12,700 a couple of days ago, bought back in at 11,500 last night - not a massive amount, but managed to nudge my BTC up a fraction. It is a load of stressful bollocks though, sticking it in permanent HODL is probably the best bet at this point.

It wasn't that I just "lost a quid", it was that I sent two pounds to link the UK account, the account didn't get linked and a pound got bounced back. At that point it seemed like there was a problem that I didn't want to get caught up in. I opted for the Euro link instead and it's worked fine so far.

UK based, and I use Coinbase with Revolut. It works fine as long as you do it all in Euros (you can convert your pounds to euros in Revolut easily) - I also lost money (one pound)trying to link it as a UK account though, even though you can apparently do it. Euros via sepa has been okay though.

I certainly haven't done anything this grand, but it does make me feel less sketchy about the various bits of BTC I bought on credit cards over the last few months! I have a pretty good job, own my own house paying less on the mortgage than when i was renting damp infested hell-flats for 18 years of my life, and have enough cards that I can keep moving the outstanding debt around for long interest free stretches. It was a hell of a risk for someone so risk adverse, but I looked at it as putting in savings that I was able to take in advance of actually saving them. What I have is now all locked up on a Trezor, and so I just sit back and enjoy the ride! And do I still buy here and there, but it's strictly bank transfter on smallish amounts I am happy to spend (£100 here, £250 there - pretty much what I was spending on craft beer over a weekend some weeks - I barely drink anymore!) Anyway man, GOOD FUCKING LUCK - I think everyone here wants to see this work out for you!

Ah, a lot of stuff about referrals here which just smacks of pyramid scheme to me - this is not what I was looking for at all, and really tells me this has very little to do with actually teaching / rewarding people about Bitcoin through watching videos.

@_date: 2019-07-17 12:12:20
Well I didn't consider it some "brilliant plan", being relatively new to the Bitcoin space I considered it as a question to put to Reddit, hence why I asked if I was "missing some fundementals" in this THEORETICAL approach. I've had some good answers tbh, but hey there's always a place in my heart for a passive aggressive smartass who knows *fucking everything*, so thumbs up to you my friend.
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:13:43
Thank! I am in Europe, \*cough\*, although my country is doing a fucking terrible job at trying to leave it at the moment (which I am fine with, I'd rather stay in and not be the fucking laughing stock of the planet) - the question honestly wasn't so much about when to sell, or tax, etc. it was really just about whether a stablecoin can "lock" my profits in the event of something crazy happening. Right now I'll be putting the Trezor in my safe for the forseeable future, and getting on with life!
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:20:44
You will have to use your real name to purchase on Coinbase, there's no way around that. Bank transfer &gt; move money to Coinbase Pro &gt; buy Bitcoin &gt; move Bitcoin to hardware wallet &gt; hibernate for ten years. If you absolutely have to cash out, sell on Coinbase Pro, transfer fund to linked bank account. That's the absolute basics that almost anyone can do. On top of that though, your location, bank, etc. may cause various issues - spend time doing thorough research on your own before doing anything.

Yes, but make sure you use Coinbase Pro. Once you have set up a Coinbase account, your details will also log you in to Coinbase Pro. As an example I bought an amount of BTC a couple of weeks ago and the fee was about 2 quid, with BTC being market rate at the time, and no hidden mark-up.

Yeah, you probably want to rein in that kind of thinking tbh. I'm almost 45, have what sounds like a similar situation to you BTC-wise, and honestly I've written it off. And by that I mean I've come to accept it could crash to zero at some point and I'm left with nothing. I can't sit around and think my small amount of BTC is going to change my life in 10 years, because that's not dissimilar to a doomsday cult saying the world was definitely going to end on millenium New Year's Eve. When potentially nothing happens (say it's 7K in 7 years) what then? For you and I it could be an absolute catastrophe, or you just go about life as usual, because you prepared mentally (and financially, with other savings and possible investments). And then if it does cray cray moon, everyone's happy!

Bittylicious is expensive because they add a mark-up on the price they are selling at right off the bat, rather than add in fees after. So right now BTC is £5,346 but on Bittylicious it's £5,508 - and that's their best option. For credit card it's even higher at £5,756 - when I first got in to cypto I used Bittylicious because I am in the UK and they seemed like a safe bet. But they are expensive as fuck. I use another service which has barely any fees, but every time I mention it I get accused of being a shill, etc. so I'll leave you to do your own research.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:20:04
Impossible to say on the price, but here's a hot tip for you if you are buying with a credit card - use Binance and pay choosing Koinal - it's currently completely fee free.

There's a guy on Twitter called Krabby - I followed him for like two days, until I realised he throws a world of shit out there, then deletes tweets the next day when certain things don't pan out. People think he's an oracle, but he's just deleting the shit he gets wrong. On top of that he posts screen grabs of a million dollars "in a wallet I forgot about!" and today is apparently giving away 10 BTC to a follower. He's acquired a lot of followers in the last week - my suspicions are that it's all one mega-scam.

If BTC isn't moving, people like to put their BTC in to alts in the hopes their satoshi value will increase, and then swap back for BTC - hence, making free BTC. Massive risk though. I've only ever done it twice, with RVN and DUSK - it did increase my BTC a bit, but it was just pure dumb luck whilst watching their market cap rapidly increasing over a short period of time and "feeling lucky." Was sweating bullets the whole time, and I haven't done it since. I know someone that got super lucky with RVN earler this year - traded 1 BTC for RVN, waited, got 5 BTC back. Jammy git!
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:52:25
Oh yeah, it's total Russian Roulette! But it'd be an impressively ballsy move on the part of the OP, especially if it works out for him :-)
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:01:36
Yeah, right? A ton of pissing and moaning from a lot of people about this fee increase, but how much does BTC cost from an ATM? And here in the UK most of the exchanges have a huge mark up on the current price of BTC to begin with, so you're paying way, way more from them in "fees" than this.

I'd straight up say that if you think the minimum you can buy is one whole bitcoin, I'd probably spend a week doing some research on your own, then come back to it. Hell, it might even have dropped in price a bit by then.

The Coinbase Earn thing is pretty good (and legit) tbh. I did all the lessons, plus had two friends each use my EOS and XLM links (so I still have two for each if anyone needs one, ahem!) - in all I think I got the equivalent of about 80 British Pounds off it, and converted it all straight to BTC. Not bad for really not a lot of work.

Sure, so what I meant was that you put your GBP in to Revolut (instant from your regular bank's debit card), within Revolut you convert that GBP to EUR (no fee). At that poiint, as long as you follow the correct steps and have linked your EUR Revolut account to Coinbase you can then transfer EUR to Coinbase via SEPA, and make your purchases in EUR. Cashing out is the exact same in reverse - EUR to Revolut, convert to GBP in Revolut, send to regular bank account. This might help too -  [

I bought a lot of mine at a higher price than it's currently at. If I sold now to try and do what you think you can pull off and the price went up, I'd be furious. The BTC I have took a while to accumulate, and the stress of trading / buy low, sell high, etc. is just not worth it, hence 90% my BTC is on a Trezor, in a safe. The other 10% is in more quickly accessable in case there's a massive rally and I can at least sell that to get my initial investment back.

Speaking as someone who is also UK based and has made various purchases since December 2017 (yes, I know!) the easist and quickest way I've been purchasing is with a credit card (Vanquis, they don't have a problem) on Binance. I got set up on there super quick, and the purchases always go through without a hitch. Credit card is obviously not the best solution by any means, but it is by far the quickest if you haven't verified a bank account on Coinbase, etc. And for a hundred quid it's probably not a big deal. I've also used Bittylicious in the UK, but I think that turned out pretty expensive for me.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:45:34

Plus it's also be morning in Asia / Australia around midnight here... because world'n'that.

You won't be able to store them in a wallet as you don't actually have any Bitcoin. I'd sell what you have, then re-buy on an exchange and move to a wallet from there. I use Revolut, but only for transfering to and from Coinbase.

In the last 6 hours it's gone up almost 300 dollars. In a month it could have gone up another five thousand dollars, but it could also be lower than it is today. If you know nothing Jon Snow, I'd suggest doing some research yourself, and not listen to co-workers and friends, and then make your own mind up.
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:09:07
Buying 100 - 150 dollars every couple of weeks is called Dollar Cost Averaging, and makes buying the dip irrelevant anyway. This would be the best way to do it as it cuts out panic buying (or selling) and means you can slowly accumulate. If the "predictions" are true, we're looking at a hundred thousand dollar BTC at the end of next year. Right now we've had a minor crash to 9,500 USD - this could be the new bottom already, nobody ever really knows. Short version - buy regularly, hold it all and see where we're at in 15 months.

You're crazy if you go with Coincorner. Their current BTC price is  £9,558.73 when it's actually currently £8,272.63 - that mark-up is complete insanity. Talking as a UK BTC purchaser, the best rates I've found are using EUR through Revolut via Coinbase Pro. A lot of these UK companies have crazy mark-ups in various guises, which is how they make a profit.

" If Bitcoin plans on the bullish side, $11,000 might become support rather than resistance. From the bearish side, a breakdown of $10,200 will send Bitcoin to retest $10,000 again. Further below is $9,880 and $9600 before the significant supporting trend-line at $9400."
I am quickly coming to realise that all TA is like this - it "might" go up, it "might" go down. Absolutely astounding that people still fall for this nonsense. After being in and out for a couple of years now, foolishly trading alts for a bit (got lucky with a couple of panic DUSK and RVN trades, but way, way too risky and stressful on the whole - never again) and trying some mediocre attempts at  "buy low, sell high" on BTC, my advice is this - buy, hold, forget about it, check in occasionally. If mega-moon then cash out at least what your initial investment was. That's it.

From what I remember, it just appeared in my EUR account on Coinbase after a few days, so I sent a larger amount and it worked. I have also paid out to Revolut no problem.
