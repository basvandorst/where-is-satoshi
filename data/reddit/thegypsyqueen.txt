Well if you ask me I'd say criminal enterprise. This clearly wasn't supposed to be Etsy or eBay or Craigslist.

Whatever dude. Instead of learning or being reasonable you just act like a prick because your argument broke down and you know you're wrong. fucking self-absorbed know it all

Well he was heading a site for criminal enterprise...
And he knowingly facilitated crime...
And he doesn't deny that he tried to have those people killed....

If they win an appeal on the other crimes?
Why was Ted Bundy sentenced to death in two different trials? 
Why was Ted Kaczynski sentenced to **8** life sentences? Why not just one? Stupid prosecutor...

Yeah but the law is fluid and debatable and even open to interpretation by a judge; as is the sentence... here we debate that the punishment is too harsh, not that the law doesn't exist.

But he wasn't convicted of trying to have them murdered, remember?  It is hard to have a conversation when the facts aren't kept straight. And prosecutors don't neglect charges if they are confident that the evidence is there.
Well here I am debating it and I think the dude is a piece of shit... so yeah, it is fluid and debatable.

Look in the mirror... the job of the prosecutor is to charge and try every crime that is committed, not stop once they are satisfied. JFC you are acting super dense. You *really* think they wouldn't try someone that would be convicted for soliciting murder because it was *too much* work? That is maybe the stupidest shit I've seen all day. I have tried to be civil and have a discourse but you are a piece of work.

you're hopeless

I am with you but it certainly matters that punishments match what is proven or not proven in court. 2 life sentences for hiring hitmen? Makes sense. Same punishment for money laundering and hacking? That's some bullshit.
