Hahaha... he's old-school and likes his fax.  I might have to show him your comment for the username alone.

I told him that you're a "he" and dad said "Good 'cause I've been married for 53 years".

My favorite tweet convo from Andreas yesterday went something like this Andreas tweets "Is the game over?"  Responder: "No, it's halftime. The game will take about 4 hours."  Andreas: "Why didn't anyone tell me?"

Here's a question that I wasn't sure about... if he wanted to pay (not receive) for a haircut or something using bitcoin, is there any way to do it without a smart phone... maybe using text somehow on an old flip phone?

Jaqen H'ghar?

Not yet but this was only the second discussion.  He wants to be sure that it is secure.  He didn't trust online banking and online financial accounts at first but now he loves them and has told all his friends about it over the years.

Clearly the safest option I agree, but what did you think about the process required to get Bcash (is it BCC or BCH) and BTG?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:12:52
When you send BTC to GDAX it goes through Coinbase first but then automatically goes over to GDAX.  To obtain the new coin, it probably doesn't matter whether your BTC is in one or the other (both insured), but to buy/sell... I always use GDAX.  I assumed people knew the 2 are connected.

I think you've pointed me toward the safest option that may also be fairly easy.  Cheers!

Haha, I posted the same thing.  Deleting now.

This could be a really good tip for me.  Are you saying that if we have our BTC on Ledger, they will appear automatically (unlike with Bcash where we had to jump through hopes)?  I can't even get the process to work for BTG... hopefully haven't lost them.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:16:52
I believe Coinbase only allows "market" orders and does not offer "limit" orders (where you can set the price).  Of the two, only GDAX has the option for limit orders.

It's good to see an opinion similar to what I thought.  I normally store in a hardware wallet or seed controlled wallet, but briefly storing on Coinbase/GDAX seemed like it would be the easiest way to obtain the new coin.  Good tip about GDAX being preferable.  Thanks.

Keep up the good work and have a soda when you get thirsty.

I haven't found any news yet but the fall seems to be slowing for BTC and ETH.  This does seem like some kind of anomaly, whether intentional or accidental.
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:36:09
I have to admit that wouldn't surprise me but I'm not ready to go full hat yet... perhaps just a tinfoil yarmulke for me, at this point.

I wondered if it was Coinbase related because it seems to be just the 3 that they carry (others aren't dropping the same way).  It was the abruptness of it that caught my eye.  Seems glitch-like.
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:19:36
I think I may have spoken (wrote) too soon... many currencies seem to be dropping now, after that pause.
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:19:45
Yeah, BCH hasn't dropped nearly as much.  It just seems like some kind of anomaly (whether it's some intentional action or a glitch).  Now, I see that Zcash is dropping also, so I think you're right about the dragging along factor.
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:25:13
I was hesitant about this but it worked.  Thanks.
