Favorite moment must have been when I started using it and my first rise in price from when I purchased some. Also when I used purse.io for the first time. For 2016 I'm hoping for more widespread adoption, preferably for brick and mortar stores, but also more webstores.

Mandatory to wear the seatbelts on the buses in Sweden. I mean, no one does it, but they're there and you can be fined if you don't, but no one does it...

I got the same impression. He's buying bitcoin at the machine. Misleading title on both the YouTube vid and this post.

Yup. Did he get them immediately or 2 hours later?

My spontaneous assumption is that the value of bitcoins would rise with there being "less" goin' around. Am I optimistic in thinking so?

So for those of us just gettin' into the bitcoin game, the halvening refers to when the rate of bitcoins getting mined will be halved?
A follow up question, if getting a new miner now, provided electricity is free or dirt cheap, it'll still mine for coins, just... slower?

Also interested in this, in the same situation.
