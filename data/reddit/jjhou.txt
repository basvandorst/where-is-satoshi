If it goes to 4k or even lower, then surely it will happen. And then I'll start really buying

But i dont actually have my keys, i couldnt have them even if i wanted. How is it guaranteed that ledger doesnt have a backdoor built in to steal my priv keys?
Yeah, I'm being a bit provocative and I actually trust ledger (but do you see the pun in that).

It's truly shocking to see the amount of bashing altcoins as their price is dropping against btc.
The truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin is not making the same kinds of business connections as some alts are. Also bitcoin doesn't have (and won't have for loong time) smart contacts, digital identity etc.

I also agree that we are probably going below 4000 soon, but don't you think you're assessments are also biased as you are in cash and hope for it to fall?

So I should throw my ledger to trash I guess...

Is this based on some actual data? Is there really so little euros going into cryptos?

I would like to know the costs for the user of bitcoin atm compared to money transfer desk. I'm not that sure that BTC is cheaper. If it's a lot cheaper, this can be pretty big in the future.

Only a month or so and Nash opens!

Fortunately the intelligently designed blockchain projects like NEO take the quantum issue seriously and are making their chains quantum proof (sorry for being provocative :D)

Seriously..... if there is no means of swapping bitcoin to fiat, it would be impossible to value bitcoin. The only way to adoption is to have easy ways to transfer to and from fiat. Only then slowly (hopefully some day) more and more transactions can happen purely in bitcoin.

Well, if the ETF is properly backed then it is at least kind of a way to swap fiat to bitcoin.

Except it might still hit near 3k or at least 5k.
Not me in the video, but the guy seems to know what he is talking about.

If there is a one hour pump and the price keeps completely steady after that, it doesn't mean that the sentiment is changing.... It just means that there were a pump for whatever reason, probably stoplosses from shorts and other limit buys triggered. My Bart TA says it will soon dump.

Well, it kind of is. Some consider highly speculative investing to be gambling
@_date: 2018-07-28 08:06:18
Yeah, the bart pattern used by manipulators got too obvious so they switched it a bit.

You should understand that in the financial world (which bitcoin is part of) people are driven by financial insentive. It's very important that you can get enough profit from from lightning for it to survive. Even tough there might be some people that do it for their ideology, you absolutely shouldn't rely on it.
Maybe somebody who has studied economics, can explain better.
