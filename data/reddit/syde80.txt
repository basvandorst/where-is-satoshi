How are they are a shill?  They are completely right.  This entire problem boils down to you not understanding their limitations before making a purchase.  You can't cry foul because you were too lazy to read the fine print.
Just because a company accepts a form of payment for 1 thing doesn't mean they accept it for all.  
Most car dealers are happy to accept credit cards for service work, but they won't accept a credit card for a car purchase.  
Same deal with buying computer hardware from big vendors.  Dell will take my credit card when I buy off their website but when I go through a sales rep on a Net-30 account they won't take a credit card.
The only thing I might side with you in is the refund policy.. but only because that depends on your jurisdiction.  No refunds is perfectly legal in mine as long as it's clearly stated at some point during the purchasing transaction.

Except... those that are innovating (the Lightning Network devs) are actually largely doing it on testnet.
Vendors that are running Lightning nodes and taking Lightning payments on mainnet are just cashing in on the free publicity for doing it.  It's several magnitudes cheaper than paying for advertising that would give equivalent exposure.  There is nothing innovative about that.

When you spend BTC, or if you exchange BTC for fiat, the taxable amount is the same.
If you exchange an amount of BTC for $100 USD or if you buy an item worth $100 USD with BTC, you still owe the same amount of tax, because you realized the same amount of gain.

Well there is a theory that the major bull run we saw near the end of last year was caused by people accumulating alot of Bitcoin that then were planning to short Bitcoin.
The idea being they cause a big inflation by accumulating alot, then they take short positions on futures while the price is high.  When the contract settlement date is nearing they start dumping their BTC, they hopefully are doing this at a profit to begin with, then they also profit on their futures contract.
Just a theory... and i'm not sure the number of contracts on the futures market really supports this theory.  I could be wrong though.

No, its simply that hashrate is currently very high on BTC.  Next difficulty adjustment is estimated to be +18% in roughly 34 hours.
Its definitely not increased Segwit adoption as the segwit tx/block is still bouncing between 10-12%.
Its possible somebody has implemented transaction batching which could be helping.  I don't know of any site that does analysis for TX batching.

Why should Bitcoin (the network) change its name to Bitcoin Core (the implementation), yet you say Bitcoin Cash (the network) should not follow the same rules?  By your logic, Bitcoin Cash should be called Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, or whatever the names of their other implementations are.  There is no implementation called "Bitcoin Cash", that is the network name.

Jesus it's scary how reckless people are being by running code the lightning  devs have actively said to not run on mainnet and still call it alpha.  People do not understand how harmful bad press about lightning mainnet could be right now.  All it will take is somebody posting on twitter that they lost .01 BTC due to lightning bug and it could set adoption way back when it's actually ready.
Please wait for lightning devs to actually say their software is ready.  Until then, you are not doing anybody any favors by running it on mainnet.  We have a testnet for a reason.  Lightning is too important right now to not get proper testing.
EDIT: I added this in a comment below, but wow the polarized comments here.  I may as well add it here:
I'll add some further context to my original post here.
I don't really have issue with the Lightning devs and those they have recruited to do testing on mainnet. These people should 100% know what they are getting themselves into and the risks associated with it. They are not going to be the ones running around telling people how much Lightning sucks because they lost funds using it.
My issue is with vendors popping up stores accepting Lightning payments and the everyday users jumping on board to use it as a result. Vendors accepting signals to the masses that its ready for use. That brings in attention... which is great... but its just too soon. You don't want exposure before you are sure you are ready for it. All it will take is for some news outlet to see store X is accepting Lightning so they decide to give it a try, when things don't work out well do you think they are going to just scrap their story? Nope. They are going to run it anyways and talk about how they lost money due to buggy software. That does Lightning network as a whole a disservice and tarnishes the names of the devs even though some of them are actively advising against using their code on mainnet still.

That is great that you have excitement about lightning adoption.. but the problem is what happens if the network snowballs right now and a critical bug is found and suddenly thousands, millions or even billions of dollars of funds are lost?  This could be a possibility into eternity of course... But right now there are lightning devs actively advising against using their code on mainnet because they are still finding circumstances where they are losing testnet funds.
There is no testing occuring on mainnet that could not instead be occuring on testnet.

I don't know Ethereum technical details, so take this as being an uneducated position.
I took a quick look here: 
which shows the data structure of an Ethereum transaction:
    fields = [
        ('nonce', big_endian_int),
        ('gasprice', big_endian_int),
        ('startgas', big_endian_int),
        ('to', utils.address),
        ('value', big_endian_int),
        ('data', binary),
        ('v', big_endian_int),
        ('r', big_endian_int),
        ('s', big_endian_int),
    ]
I am going to say the answer is no.  Eth does not have a means of expiring a transaction based on time just like Bitcoin does not.  The v,r,s fields appear to be signature data.  I don't know exactly what the "data" field is for, but it seems like it would be a strange place to put a timestamp.

Transactions that happen on lightning won't make it onto the ledger.
What will make it onto the ledger is when you commit X funds to opening a lightning channel in addition there is a second entry made when you close / settle that lightning channel which basically records your remaining balance.  The individual transactions that happened on lightning are never put into the BTC blockchain.
This is a bit over simplified of course.

I'm not saying it is because of the China news, I'm just saying it seems a lot more plausible than trying to say this dip occurred because a bunch of Asians need money to give away as gifts in a few weeks.
The dip regarding the Korea news was real, you'd be a fool to try and say that dip occurred for any other reason.  The problem was the news was reported inaccurately.  That part doesn't matter though, the news being accurate or not and whether that was on purpose or not doesn't change the fact that the dip occurred because of it.

That is not thinking bigger picture.  You are ignoring the fact that all it takes it for 1 person to lose big money on lightning software and cry foul to the media to cause a massive surge in bad press for lightning and set it back by years.
If an individual truly understands that the developers of the software are not yet willing to stake their names on you not losing money by using their software... Then by all means go for it.   The problem is it's far too easy to think everything is good to go and nice and safe when vendors say they are accepting it.   Those vendors did this as a publicity stunt because the press they get by being, even if they lose all their lightning revenue is far far far cheaper advertising than paying for equal exposure through regular channels.

It was probably Coinbase's fault and not Overstock.
I don't know the Coinbase API... but it probably just sends notification to Overstock that payment was received for order   Coinbase should have never sent that notification since the payment received was incorrect.  Even more... Coinbase should not have even believed that payment was received since it was received on the wrong network.  This probably tells us that Coinbase doesn't process each network independently.  
I'd be willing to bet if it were possible to just convert BTC/BCH addresses into LTC addresses, that this same bug would have also worked.  This would have magnified the financial impact by 10x.  IE buy a $15k item valued at 1 BTC, instead send 1 LTC valued at $250.

If it only had 2 outputs, then it is highly unlikely to be a batch transaction.
One of the outputs would have been the payment to you, the other output would be the change left over from your payment that they send back to themselves.
Just FYI... the way a Bitcoin transaction works is that all inputs (source of funds) are ALWAYS spent in full.  If you have an input that contains 10BTC and you want to spend funds from this input, you must spend all 10 BTC.  Of course, you generally don't want to actually do that.  If you want to send somebody 1 BTC, what happens is the 10BTC is the input to the transaction, and the transaction will have 2 outputs, the first will be 1 BTC being sent to wherever you are sending money, the second output will be 9 BTC (minus TX fee) that is sent to your change address.  The change address can be the same address as the input if you want, or it can be a completely new address (which is more common).  The next time you want to spend funds from your left over 9 BTC, that 9 BTC output then becomes an input to the next transaction.
The other thing you probably don't know is that an address doesn't have a "balance" on the blockchain like you might think.  Your balance of funds is actually the sum of all outputs sent to that address.  If you receive 100x 0.01BTC payments, what you actually have is 100x 0.01BTC inputs to spend, NOT a single 1 BTC input.  Spending these funds will be *considerably* more expensive because if you want to send a full 1 BTC to someobdy from all these inputs, then all of those inputs must be included and signed in the transaction.  The transaction will be very large and take up alot of blockspace.  It can sometimes be a good idea to try and consolidate your funds during non-peak times to consolidate all these low value outputs into a single higher value one to reduce the cost of future spending.

Each node is free to specify the min fee to have their tx enter their mempool.  The min fee option is built right into Bitcoin Core.  While I personally believe that if they want to be good stewards of the network... They should mine lesser value transactions, but it is a free market and they can do what they wish.  This could either be them having set this a long time ago when the value was less, they could have done this to keep their mempool at a reasonable size when it was very large, or it could be them purposefully wasting blockspace   to increase avg fees.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:40:43
I'd just like to point out that people should take note of the time span here.  There is a common misconception that Bitcoin transactions expire from mempool after a period of time.  This is only a semi truth.  
Nodes running Bitcoin Core will by default keep a tx in mempool for 2 weeks from the time it recieved it.  That does not mean it's 2 weeks from the time it was created, signed, or broadcast.
A transaction in Bitcoin is timeless.  It is valid forever as long as the inputs are unspent.  A transaction can live on the network forever by any node rebroadcasting your tx over and over and over.  You could send a tx and not have it confirm for 1000 years as long as the inputs remain unspent.
If you send a tx that does not confirm and you change your mind about it... When your wallet allows you to, respend at least one of the inputs, even if it means spending to yourself.  Once that new tx confirms, the original becomes invalid.

The point of restoring your 1st nano onto the 2nd is to make sure you are not losing access to the funds on your 1st nano in the event it gets lost/stolen/damaged.  You are just testing your recovery procedure so that you know you can do it successfully and you know you wrote down your seed words correctly.
The only other benefit to having both nanos setup with the same wallet is that they are both able to spend the same funds.  If you have one and your wife has another, it is the same concept as having a joint chequing account.

Actually, they do.  Whenever there are rumors of something that is going to affect Bitcoin it starts to affect its price.  That is why sometimes by the time a rumor turns into fact, when the fact is announced the price can sometimes be unaffected.  That is because the fact was already "priced in" due to the rumors.
It doesn't even have to be a rumor, it can be something known too.  Like the block halving in 2020.  It will get "priced in" before the actually happens and when it happens you might see no change in price.

Do not wipe your first nano until you know you can recovery it successfully.
If you wipe it and find you wrote down your seed wrong somehow... everything on your nano is lost.
All you need to do is setup the 2nd nano as if you were recovering the 1st.  Do not touch the 1st one that has control over your BTC.  You do not need to wipe the 1st nano in order to recover it on the 2nd.  You can have 50000 wallets all with control of the same BTC / private keys simultaneously if you want.  All wallets will control the same funds doing this.

BTC miner is probably about 99.999% ASIC miners today.
The highest end GPU that was benchmarked  -  which is fairly outdated as the GPU is probably about 6-7 years old is an AMD 7970 X3 and can produce 2.0 Gigahash/sec or 0.002 Terahash/s (this becomes important in a minute), its power efficiency is 2.241 Megahash/joule
An AntMiner S9 ASIC miner produces up to 12 Terahash/s and it does this with an efficiency of  10182 Megahash/joule
As you can see... these things are not even remotely on the same level of speed or power efficiency.  Its like a national league sports team playing against a high school team.  If you compared ASIC vs CPU the comparison will look even more stark.  CPU mining is basically pee-wee league.

I don't think Roger did CB any favors considering there is huge suspicions of insider trading at CB and when he was questioned about it he just said he thinks insider trading is a non crime.  He basically just confirmed somebody at CB leaked info.  Will cause huge damage for CB and will likely have huge consequences of the working environment for those at CB.

Segwit is supported in bitcoind:










It returns the witness script.


"witnessaddress",  (string) The value of the new address (P2SH of witness script).
Bitcoin-qt however does not support it through the GUI without using the command interface.  Completely agree support would be good.   There is a [Segwit pull request]( that looks like its getting close to completion to add full wallet support.  There is also a [bech32 pull request]( that has already been merged into master.

I think BTC might be one of the best bets in the very immediate short term for gains.
All that BCH on GDAX can only be exchanged for either USD, EUR, or BTC.  There is no other cyrpto pair besides BTC.  I'm guessing this is going to cause a fair big surge in BTC, which will likely be followed by a sell off of BTC into other alts.  Some will stay in BTC so it should maintain some of those gains, but if you want to max profit probably best to jump on board with LTC, ETH, or XMR.

Unless your deposit address has changed to a 3* or bc1* address, then it's not an exchange having implemented segwit.
The real gains from segwit come from when you send FROM a segwit input.  Exchanges won't have significant inputs until their customers are depositing to those addresses, or they do some mass consolidation first.
You would also be able to tell when you withdraw if it came from a segwit address.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:41:33
Good point.  I do believe you are correct.  I think the only way you can tell a P2SH output was actually a Segwit transaction and not just a non-segwit P2SH tx is once that output is spent.

If you feel comfortable with it, post the transaction IDs of anything that happens on the BTC and BCH networks.
An unspent output is essentially the crypto you currently hold in your wallet.  Even transaction has inputs and ouputs.  An *unspent* output is essentially a sum of BTC that has not yet been spent (sent to a new address).

Rush?  No, rushing would have been having Segwit live on an exchange on September 15th, the day after Bitcoin Core supported the addwitnessaddress RPC call.  Hell, maybe even you can call September 28th rushing when [HitBTC made a support announcement](  If you think that is rushing, well hell [Bitstamp doing it on September 7th]( is before Core even supported the addwitnessaddress command is all that much more impressive.
Core software is a building block for an exchange.  Their stack is built ontop of it, a responsible development team would be keeping an eye on the development of their building blocks and know what is in store for the next release and they in turn would be preparing to support and integrate new features before the building block has actually released their next version.  Especially when you know, Coinbase previously was spouting off that their users were screaming at them saying they needed a scaling solution.  The need was so urgent for them then that they were prepared to rush into running Jeff Garzik's Segwit2x btc1 code.  That sure would have worked out well for them huh?

I would anticipate they move to just being lending institutions.  You might also see alot more legit and trusted Bitcoin centered banks at some point.   There is still a huge hurdle of usability and security with Bitcoin.  Being your own bank is great, but it's also terrifying knowing you could wipe out your fortune by mistake very easily.

It's ideal to not store your coins on any online wallet or exchange.  If that company goes under or gets hacked your coins are gone and they are not insured for this.

You should consider an unconfirmed transaction as always being valid and possibly getting confirmed forever... unless, you re-spend one of the same inputs used in the unconfirmed transaction.  That is the only way to invalidate the original transaction.
TO actually answer your question... Bitcoin Core, by default, keeps a tx in mempool for 14 days.  However, there is nothing stopping anybody from re-broadcasting your transaction over and over and over keeping it in the mempool forever - until you do something that might invalidate it.

Seeds are a series of words, typically 12 at minimum that are used to algorithmically generate your private keys.  Private keys are something that in turn are required to sign transactions (spend your bitcoins) that belong to their associated public key (your receiving addresses).
If you lost your wallet, which contains your private keys.  You can re-create them using the seed words and thus recover access to your funds.
It is not just applicable to hardware wallets.  Most software wallets are using them today as well.

Developer will have a sum of BTC or will work with investors that do have a significant sum of BTC.
Coin will fork at the specified block height.  A wallet will be released - maybe even before that date, maybe not.
Developer will try and get it listed on exchanges and will have a timeline of which ones will go live first.  
The moment an exchange goes live, developer sends theirs/investors' coins to that exchange and dumps the fuck out of it.
Nothing else happens with the coin and everybody forgets that it event exists.

A tx will live in a nodes mempool for 336 hours using Bitcoin Core with default settings.
However, since a tx in reality is timeless it's impossible to tell a TXs true age.  
A tx can be rebroadcast by anybody to keep it in the mempool and as far as your node is concerned, thats a new tx even if it expired it 30s earlier and it lives there for another 336 hours.
There are not many legitimate reasons for nodes to randomly rebroadcast other people's transactions... But there may be some reasons to try and keep the mempool as full as possible for a social smear campaign.

I totally understand your concerns about LN being unsafe with full blocks.  I've got nothing to back this up so its really just my own thoughts... but I believe the idea here is to get Lightning up and running and see what impact it will have on the blockchain / mempool.  At that time, if a blocksize increase is needed, I believe it will be proposed.  I'm personally not outright against a blocksize increase.  However as somebody that also runs a full listening node, I completely understand the concerns about doing it.  


Personally, again as somebody actually running a Core node, my concern is not about chain growth assuming its not exponential growth.  My bigger concern is regarding bandwidth consumption and total transfer usage.  My node currently uses about 1.6 TB/month in data consumption.  Its probably about 95% upstream bandwidth.  Averaging over a month, it works out to right around 5mbit/s upstream.  My total upstream allowance on my connection is 10mbit/s.  That means if Bitcoin's on-chain transactions did any more than double, I would start getting muscled out of being a participating node.  Certainly there are people with significantly faster connections than me, my connection is basically average for where I live.  I live in a 1st world country, but not in a major urban area... semi-urban i suppose... again... "average".  There are people all over the world with far far far worse connections than me.   People that already can't run full nodes.  If there is real potential for me to get muscled out being average, how are those in 3rd world countries or places with very expensive internet connections supposed to participate?  Its not fair to expect them to run light wallets because that involves having to trust somebody else which goes against the trustless intentions of Bitcoin.
Right now a person with a $35 Raspberry Pi can run a full node even with a below average internet connection.  There is even the option for these people to get the latest Bitcoin blocks via the Blockstream satellite service completely for free with a little extra cheap hardware.  These people will get completely muscled out if something isn't done to keep the bandwidth requirements for running a node as low as possible.
The concerns of node centralization is a real concern.  Honestly I personally downplayed it until I actually started running my own node.  To me, chain growth is not the most important issue.  Storage is always getting larger and cheaper.


I don't think you'll argue that these people leaving these reviews are just ignorant.  I don't mean that to be insulting, I don't expect the average person to be pushing a service for a technology upgrade.  However those that are not ignorant and have personal motivations for a particular service to implement it *should* push them for it.  These are the people that are seen by their friends as being experts at this and the people that get asked for help with it.  If those people are not impressed with a particular company they will stop recommending them.

Realistically... they wouldn't because if they didn't confirm transactions then the Bitcoin network does not work.
Fees are there to:
1. Because the block discovery bonus eventually goes to zero and miners need to still make money when that happens
2. Prevent spam on the network.  If transactions were free, then anybody could easily preform a denial of service attack on the network for zero cost.  With the way it is... doing an attack has a very significant cost associated.

I'm personally not convinced the 19.5k that was seen on gdax yesterday was "normal".  It happened right before coinbase / gdax crashed, but what was stranger was that the 10-15 minutes leading up to that price, the gdax order book looked to basically be running dry.  Personally I think what happened was that people had some orders in the book to buy at heavily discounted rates and some to sell at heavily premium rates.  I think likely some people with trade bots still managed to get some new orders put in and due to the order book in general running dry it completely threw off their programmed logic and likely caused them to do some buy orders that they were not really intended to do (buying way too high) if the market had been functioning properly.
I have no real evidence that this is the case... and I know Bithumb had even higher prices.  But the market on GDAX, which i was watching at the time just plain looked like something was broken with it BEFORE it actually went down.  I suspect things either crashed in stages, or got significantly slowed down in stages.  Technicians there probably saw this and manually shut the market down, not it actually "crashing" outright.  GDAX was having completely wild swings at the time... like flip-flopping between 16k and 19k 10 times in a single second.  That is just not normal.  The price on GDAX was also hitting 1.5-2k higher than Bitfinex and Bitstamp, when these 3 markets traditionally are all within $100-200 of each other.
So the point is... I completely agree that 19.5k on GDAX was a huge anomaly.  I do not believe that was a natural price, I think it was a result of GDAX going up in flames.  I think in the using Bitfinex's number of 17.2k as the ATH is likely much more accurate when doing market analysis.

However... its hard to blame wallet and service providers from supporting bech32 considering that BIP173 is not even officially adopted by Core at this point.

So yes... please start supporting native P2WPKH transactions without P2SH.

What you need is to just get all the major exchanges to get off there fucking asses and start using Segwit transactions by default.  If they just all start receiving on P2SH-P2WPKH addresses it will go along way to giving breathing room, because when they pay out they will be sending from Segwit addresses, which is where the biggest gains are to be had.  Even if their customers are all using legacy P2PKH addresses, it will still make a big difference.
Major exchanges that do not support Segwit today:
1. Bitfinex has said Q1 2018
2. Coinbase / GDAX has said "in 2018"
3. Gemini claims they are ready, but do not appear to have deployed and I can't find anything that gives a roadmap for them.
Two that I'm not sure about, can't find much on them but they are Asian markets so... language barrier.
1. Bithumb - Don't know.
2. BTCC - not sure, though they were supporters of the Segwit fork and mined the very first Segwit block.  Can't find anything about their exchange though.
This is just a small list.  However please remember that Exchanges is the entry and exit point to Bitcoin for 99% of people.  Its imperative that they support Segwit and that they use Segwit by default.
I don't use them... (not in my market), but for those trading USD, Bitstamp might be a good alternative that supports Segwit - no idea about their funding options though.

Their announcement doesn't have segwit right.  It doesn't reduce miner fee, or increases network throughput.   The higher throughput will result in much more than 40% reduction in fees if transaction volume remains unchanged.  This is because the available capacity would be larger than the volume instead of being the other way around.  This would result in fees going as low as 1 sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:28:02
If just increasing the size of blockchain over time is all they wanted, they why didn't they just jump onboard with Litecoin?  It essentially accomplishes the same thing and doesn't have a miner power struggle with BTC due to using a different PoW algorithm.
Bitcoin - 1MB block every 10 minutes
Litecoin - 1MB block every 2.5 minutes (= 4MB every 10 minutes)
Litecoin however has Segwit, which means its transactional capacity at 4MB is actually larger than what BCH's at 4MB would have been.

My uninformed opinion is that allowing someone to unmask CTs is FAR less dangerous than allowing somebody to create BTC out of thin air.  Creating BTC without proof of work completely undermines the entire network.  Allowing somebody to unmask CTs only undermines one feature.
The Risk / Cost vs Reward of the 2 options seem way way different that **very** heavily favors unmasking as being the better option for BTC to implement.

It would be way less secure for the ATM owners to have BTC stored on a wallet running on the ATM itself.
The ATM should just communicate with a server controlled by the ATM service provider that is running in a data center somewhere.  The bitcoin wallet would be running on that server and would broadcast / receive any transactions for sales / purchases that were initiated from the ATM.
There is very little reason you'd ever want to store BTC on a wallet on the actual ATM.  In this situation, theft or damage to the ATM could result in lost BTC if there is no backup of the wallet elsewhere or if a theif figured out a way to extract the private keys from it.  With there being no BTC on the ATM itself, theft or damage to the ATM only results in losses equal to the cost of the ATM and not what its contents would have been.

A P2SH transaction does not have its witness data segregated, so its witness data will count as 4 weight/byte just like a legacy P2PKH transaction.

I'm actually already *really* curious what would happen if somebody spammed the BCH network and one of the miners broadcast a block that is &gt; 8MB.  Some BCH implementations allow 32MB blocks (Bitcoin Unlimited I think) while others only allow 8MB (Bitcoin ABC I think).  I believe it would cause their network to fork and all sorts of people could end up losing money... unless they decide to maintain both forks... Bitcoin Cash Classic maybe.

The price can continue to increase despite anything in the mempool.  Keep in mind the price is *largely* set by individuals on exchanges.  Not a single bitcoin needs to trade hands for people bringing fiat into an exchange and buying Bitcoin.  Alot of Bitcoin already exists in the exchange's wallets and people are buying/selling there without any transactions hitting the blockchain at all.  If anything, people having trouble getting transactions onto the blockchain is just going to help increase prices.  People that have Bitcoins and want to sell them have to get it onto the exchange first.  If people can't get Bitcoin onto an exchange then it reduces the supply of Bitcoin available for purchase, which drives the price up.
EDIT:  All of this said, while the price going up is great and all... I certainly don't think the current transaction times/fees are a good thing in the long run by any means.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:38:09
I'm not sure there is a way to force a miner to include the highest fee TXs.
Its certainly possible that a TX can get broadcast and never make it to a miner's node's mempool because its peers rejected the TX for some reason.  It wouldn't be fair to then reject their block because it might have been missing one high fee TX.
I suppose you could do it by having something like the difficulty adjustment algorithm and basically come up with a new consensus rule about a fee minimum to include in a block.  Not sure how I feel about this though as it also means miners can't do "charitable" work by including a low fee TX from a person that can't afford it.... kinda like the ViaBTC TX accelerator.

Even more important in the short term - ask your exchange when they will begin using native segwit transactions.  I think its fair to assume the majority of the transactions on the Bitcoin network right now are likely transactions involving exchanges.  Getting them to support sending Segwit-based transactions will make an immediate increase in transaction throughput on the network, which will lower fees for everybody.
Call out your exchange and tell them you expect them to do their part and start supporting the technologies that are available to them today to help themselves and all other Bitcoiners.

It's not that difficult for them to switch to P2SH-P2WPKH addresses if they are using bitcoind on the backend.  It's literally just adding 1 extra RPC call to addwitnessaddress after generating a new address.  If they are going to make the leap directly to native segwit / bech32 addresses, which would be great, it is a little more complicated.  But seriously... Stop giving them excuses.

So coinbase and almost all websites that hold on to your crypto are not actually wallets.  They are kind of like a bank where you deposit cash and the bank says ya I owe you $x, let me know when you want it.  Basically they are just giving you IOUs.  Except in the case of crypto, none of them are insured from theft and they are huge hacking targets and many have been hacked in the past.
A Bitcoin wallet is not like a traditional wallet.  Infact a Bitcoin wallet does not even store bitcoins within it.  A wallet stores private keys that are needed to spend your coins that live on the public ledger.  
The line you will hear people often say is something to the effect of if you don't control the private keys, you don't control the bitcoins.
If your intention is to just sit on your investment, I'd just create a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet.   
Coinbase will not automatically send to your wallet when you purchase.  When you purchase on coinbase again they are basically just giving you an IOU for whatever amount you bought and they hold onto the Bitcoin that you  are entitled to.  Somewhere on there website will be the option to withdraw.  You'd do that and put in the public key address of your paper wallet and they will send it there.

Technically speaking, there is no such thing as cancelling a transaction in Bitcoin.  Once a transaction is broadcast it could live on the network forever.  Bitcoin Core by default will expunge a transaction after its lived in its mempool for 14 days.  However, each node could have longer or shorter times, it could remove it for another reason and... nodes could even re-broadcast it for whatever reason and restart that timer.  You know how they say don't upload something to the internet like a picture you might be embarassed about in the future?  Its the same with Bitcoin transactions... even if you were to try and delete it somehow, you can never know its truly gone.
Ok so that is the technicality of it.
You do have some options.
1)  You could attempt to double spend it, meaning you will simply sweep the key again, but do it with something that lets you specify the fee and make it higher.  If the new TX gets confirmed, it will invalidate the original tx and essentially "cancel" the original tx.
2) The more legit way... you can do something called "Child Pays for Parent".  I don't know how to do this with your wallet, but the general concept is that you need to spend the funds FROM one of the outputs of the original unconfirmed transaction.  The new transaction cannot be validated until the original transaction is confirmed.  You need to make the fee on this new transaction high enough that a miner will see value in confirming the original transaction.  So your orignal tx is about 40 sat/byte, if you think you think miners will confirm something at 60 sat/byte, then your new tx should pay 80 sat/byte so that the average of both TXs is high enough that a miner will confirm both at the same time.
3) If your TX was sent with the Replace by Fee flag, you can just up the fee on the TX and rebroadcast... but not many wallets support RBF for whatever reason.  I know Electrum does, not sure about any others.

He's not wrong.  Each node has its own mempool and may accept or reject a tx for any reason it wants.
Also, your mempool starts from zero when you start up your node.  You won't get any "old" transactions into your mempool unless a peer for some reason re-broadcasts it to you. 
My listening Core 0.15.1 node running on basically default settings that has not restarted for 17 days has about 165k transactions in it.

The timing was perfect for it, BTC getting gains and mass media exposure, at the same time people complaining about high fees and slow transaction times and lastly Litecoin being viewed by new entrants as more affordable due to lower cost/coin because they don't always understand you don't have to own a full coin.

A transaction can live in mempool forever as long as nothing has changed to make the transaction now invalid.
Something most people do not realize is that Bitcoin transactions are timeless.  They contain no timestamp and it's impossible to tell when the transaction was signed or broadcast.  A node knows the time that a transaction entered the mempool, but it has no idea when the transaction was created or sent.  
What that means is that a transaction can be broadcast and rebroadcast forever and ever.  As long as the transaction is still valid that is all that matters and you should consider that transaction still occuring.  That is because even if it leaves every nodes mempool, somebody could replay the transaction at any time in the future.
The only way to make a transaction invalid is to respend at least one of the  same inputs that was used in the original transaction.  Once the new tx is confirmed the original tx is considered invalid.
Edit: corrected a word.

And market cap for currencies is actually kind of a pointless number.  Just because BTC has a market cap of say 1 trillion doesn't mean that 1 trillion dollars of it have been spent on it.  All it means is **IF** somebody paid current market price for every single coin in existence that is what the cost would be.  Reality is the price would fluctuate wildly as those coins were being purchased.  The price would either skyrocket if it's desirable or plummet if it's non desirable.  Either way, it would either cost nowhere near 1 trillion or way way way more than 1 trillion .

Yeah that TX is not going to get confirmed.  You paid 1 sat/byte and its a huge transaction taking up almost 5% of a block by itself.
Guessing this is mining revenue?  This is the reason why you should have higher payout threshholds from your pool.  
You are going to want to try and consolidate these inputs during a time when the blockchain backlog isn't as high so you can do it for low fees.  You could be waiting awhile though, hard to say.

Here is the thing about BCH... they have a few different pieces of node software and some of them allow a 32MB limit while others only allow 8MB.    So they actually don't have a consensus about their consensus rules...
This effectively means they have to implement a 32MB block as a hardfork.  Whichever software already supports 32MB doesn't have to do anything... but clients that don't (I believe Bitcoin ABC only support 8MB) will reject block size &gt; 8MB, which effectively means they have to do it via hardfork.
I actually wonder what would happen if somebody made a single BCH transaction that was &gt; 8MB and one of the miners that supports &gt; 8MB blocks today mined it.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:25:06
It's additional data storage, longer times to verify blocks, and longer times for block propagation which increases orphan rates.  
All that said, most people believe block size will need to increase at some point.  It would be useful right now, but may prove unnecessary once lightning is launched.

@_date: 2017-12-08 23:03:55
There is some concept of coin age, but to be honest I don't know what it's really used for.  It's definitely not used for free transactions.  Tx fees is basically buying you block space.  Don't pay enough and no miner will confirm your tx because they want to be paid for their effort.

In this case though, all of the futures being offered are in fact cash settled.  So the commenter you replied to is correct.  There are no BTC transactions happening as a direct result of a CME or CBOE contract.  I'm sure there will be lots of indirect transactions as a result of them though 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:01:57
The best thing to help on the short term is going to be getting exchanges to support native segwit transactions.  These transactions are smaller than legacy transactions which will increase network throughput overall, which results in fees decreasing.
If you haven't already, email your exchange or submit a support request asking when they will have segwit implemented.

1. Segwit is fully live on the network whether the Core wallet software supports it or not.  The actual consensus rules regarding it are live and in full effect.
2. The price goes up because people see a future for it.  Its not just about what Bitcoin can do right now, its about what people believe Bitcoin to be able to do tomorrow and the day after.
3.  Keep in mind that Lightning Network and Bitcoin Network are completely different things.  Lightning Network is going to use the Bitcoin Network as a foundation layer.  They are completely separate projects run by different groups with different goals.  Lightning is not a "Bitcoin Core" project - though there is likely some cross over with devs.

~~I'm not going to comment on whether transactions your node considers old are thrown out or not because I don't know whether that is true or not.~~  I looked it up, by default in the Bitcoin Core client a TX is kept in mempool for 336 hours, but its a command line option to specify whatever.  However I will say that a node does not know the true age of a transaction because its impossible to tell.  A transaction could be rebroadcast by any node for any reason, so even if your node might consider it old and drop it, another node might just relay it back to you anyways.  
You are absolutely right that most wallet software will wait a period of time before marking a transaction unspent, but the wallet the transaction came from knows precisely when the transaction was spent.  I'm sure you also know there is no standard on the length of time a wallet should wait before it can safely consider a tx as dropped.
If a person wants to be truly safe with any failed TXs and wants to prevent it from being confirmed, they should re-spend the funds.  That will invalidate the previous transaction.  The original transaction is susceptible to a replay attack.

Transaction time has a direct relation to the fee you or the exchange you used paid.  
Bitcoin can only confirm a certain amount of transactions over a given time period.   Typically those that paid the highest fees get confirmed first. 
There is backlog being created right now and the best things to help reduce it in the immediate short term is having services convert to using segwit as it can fit more transactions into a block than legacy addresses.  There is work being done on the longer term solutions.
Ultimately, the speed slow down is being caused by bitcoins success.

No, you should send it again now.  Even if you don't intend on paying the same person, you should send a TX that uses at least one of the same inputs as the original TX, even if that new TX is to yourself.
To give you some explanation...
A TX has no timestamp.  Once you broadcast a TX, nobody can tell you anything about the true time that you actually sent that TX.  The only thing with respect to time that they know is 1) the time it entered their mempool, and 2) that it was sent sometime after all of the inputs of the new TX becomes unspent outputs.
So why does this matter... the point is your unconfirmed transaction is valid *forever*.  A Bitcoin Core node, by default, will keep your TX in mempool for 14 days.  However, there is nothing stopping anybody from rebroadcasting your TX over and over and over again keeping it in mempool forever.  Somebody could have captured the TX data and they could even rebroadcast it 10 years from now, its still a valid transaction, and 10 years from now you might be super pissed about losing that amount of Bitcoin.
There is only 1 way to prevent this from happening to you.  If you re-spend at least one of the same inputs, then it invalidate the original transaction making it not possible to confirm it because that input will no longer contain the funds and will be seen as a double spend.
The chances of this actually happening are extremely low and the only person that really stands to directly benefit from it is the person you sent the funds to, but its still best to protect yourself.

Yes, fees in BTC are high right now, however there is a game plan with lightning coming.  There is no official launch date, it could launch this afternoon for all anybody knows.  It is already being used successfully on testnet.  Devs have even already done tests on mainnet.  Keep in mind that Lightning is NOT a Bitcoin Core project.  Bitcoin only provides the foundation to enable Lightning.  So its kind of like asking Microsoft when Adobe will release the next version of Photoshop for Windows.

I don't think that is realistic and sets a dangerous precedent for feature bloat.  Lightning is only 1 possible layer 2 application for Bitcoin.  There are many in the works, for example Rootstock.  It would be impossible for Bitcoin Core to implement all of these and keep up.  They also have no impartial way to determine which get included and which don't.  
It would kind of be like the Linux kernel included the Apache web server and all dependencies into the kernel source tree.  
I actually think if anything in the future Bitcoin Core might consider divesting itself of features.  Perhaps removing mining functions off into its own software considering that those functions are irrelevant to 99.9% of users.

Since you have 2, you can test your restore procedure by using the 2nd nano s.  When you set it up you don't want to create a new wallet, tell it you want to recover an existing one.  You'll input your seed on the 2nd one.
Once the 2nd one is setup, connect it to your wallet application, and presuming it has access to the coins from the 1st nano, you are good to go.
If it doesn't gain access to the 1st wallet, you are going to want to re-setup the 2nd nano as a new wallet, backup your seed correctly this time.  Move your coins to the 2nd nano, then re-test this procedure as if the 2nd nano was the 1st.

They probably are not losing anything.  This is how it works, put yourself in the shoes of a whale with a large BTC &amp; cash position.
You know GDAX typically has higher prices, especially when rallies happen.
You put up a 1000 BTC @ 19k sell wall on GDAX, this keeps the price surprised on GDAX even if its 18.99k.
Meanwhile, you've got cash loaded up on Bittstamp, Bitfinex, whatever where the price can often lag $500/BTC or more.
You then buy up 1025 BTC on the other exchanges for the exact same amount of $ that you sold your 1000 on GDAX for.
They didn't lose, they actually gained 2.5% BTC.
Now whether they could have just gained more $ overall if they had just let the price of BTC go up... who knows, but these guys know the price of BTC going up is going to happen regardless in the long term and if anything, them buying up more BTC should just make BTC more scare = BTC goes up more.

I just want to clear up one thing.  Andreas has NOTHING to do with CME's futures markets he is not on any board governing overseeing the futures market.  He IS a member of CME's oversight committee for their  Bitcoin reference rate.   the only thing this committee does is help setup the rules for determining what the price of Bitcoin is at a given point in time.  This rate will be used by the futures market, but the 2 are otherwise completely unrelated.  Andreas even said in the video that he learned about the futures market from a post on Reddit, meaning he didn't even know CME was making it despite being on the committee he is on.  He explains this in the first 5 minutes of the video.

Absolutely, and while it might seem somewhat terrible to some when it happens... the truth of it is, this is actually one of the strengths and founding principals of decentralization.  If a group decides they don't like the current consensus rules they are free to go off in their own direction and there is nothing anybody can do to stop that.  That is actually a very important concept in all of this and something that adds to cryptos value.  Your money isn't locked up with central bank X where they make the rules and force them upon you and can potentially hold your money hostage.  With crypto, if you think of Bitcoin as being "bank X" - well enough customers of bank X get pissed off and they can just take there money and form bank Y no matter what bank X says.
Honestly, I think most people that call themselves Bitcoin Core supporters wouldn't even have a problem with BCH or any of its popular personalities if it weren't for the combative tactics being used by many - yes it goes both way, but at least to me it seems skewed that there is a lot more anti-BTC talk than there is anti-BCH talk.  I probably have obvious bias though.  It seems to me that biggest reason BCH supporters talk about what makes them better is that "its not Bitcoin" and every minor victory is just a finger pointing at Bitcoin and saying "I told you so".  Those victories should certainly be celebrated as should the technical or ideological merits of BCH that can be viewed as making it better... but you know, nobody likes a sore winner.  It really just breads more animosity.   It does happen on both sides though, I'm well aware of this... like I said, it just seemed rather skewed in the direction its happening.

I'm not going to name any other exchanges because I don't have first hand experience with them.  I can tell you there are choices, some have even been around longer than coinbase.
However I will tell you.  They get shit on because they are not reliable.  They crash everytime there is a major rally because there engine doesn't properly scale automatically or because they are penny pinching and refuse to pay for peak level resources at non peak time.  Additionally they do things like being prepared to support segwit2x, which only had a single developer behind it and his code contained multiple fatal bugs.  They supported this because they were screaming their customers needed a scaling solution right now, segwit2x didn't pan out but they then suddenly drop the argument that they need a scaling solution and drag their heels on implementing segwit.  They alone probably make up a significant portion of blockchain transaction and thus their inaction is directly harming the Bitcoin network and it's growth.  They also don't implement transaction batching... Which again their inaction harms the network.  
So the end of the day, yes, coinbase deserves to be shit on until they start demonstrating that they are looking after the best interests of Bitcoin.  Right now, they are not by way of their inaction.  They are claiming they are now working on it and giving a very non committal timeline of "in 2018".  
Again as I said, coinbase offers a convenient entry and exit point to Bitcoin.  However its short sighted thinking to let this blind you over the rest of their business.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:23:17
Batching saves a ton of space.  It's actually a more worthwhile investment for an exchange than segwit imo.
Take a look at this recently confirmed tx 
It paid looks like close to 70 people from a single input.  It fit that into 2644 bytes.
A normal 1 input 2 output transaction is around 250 bytes.  If the linked tx had been sent non batched it would have required more like 17500 bytes.  
Exchanges that are not sending batched payments should be publically shamed far far more than for not supporting segwit tx 
Ps, I believe I've heard others say coinbase does not do batched TXs.   If that is true and they implemented it you would likely see a very noticeable difference in mempool size.

There is no released version of the Core client that supports **native** P2WPKH addresses.
Bitcoin Core 0.15.1 can generate Segwit P2SH-P2WPKH addresses by using the addwitnessaddress command, however this actually gives you a P2SH address, NOT a native P2WPKH address.
A transaction to a P2SH address is actually larger than a legacy P2PKH... so this is actually more harmful to block congestion.
I do believe that the master branch of Bitcoin Core can generate native P2WPKH addresses, but I've not tried it yet.

Incase anybody wants some real-world numbers.
I run a full listening node.
Over the past month my node averages:
5.3 GB/day downloaded
49.2 GB/day uploaded
This means running my node uses about 1.6TB of transfer per month.  I am fortunate that I have an unlimited data plan so this is not a big concern for me.
My upstream bandwidth from my ISP however is 10mbit, running this node consumes 50% of that upstream bandwidth.  If blocks / transaction volume were double the size they are now, I would likely have to start putting QoS limits on the upstream, so I would not be participating in the network as much as I am now.  If blocks / transaction volume were any more than double then I'd have to start putting in more serious limits on my participation.
Actual chain growth is less of a concern for me at the moment.  However others that are doing things like running a node on a raspberry pi would get pushed out pretty quick.

Each market operates independly.  There is no central authority on what Bitcoin's price is.  
So to answer your question... the reason is because there are buyers at a particular exchange that feel its worth $20k and buyers at another exchange that only think 18.5k.
You can take advantage of this by doing arbitrage if you have the means.

Bitcoin is money.  Bitcoin is a blockchain application.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:39:54
So here is something that is a very common misconception.
Bitcoin is not stored in a Bitcoin wallet.
All Bitcoin is really just entries in a public ledger (the blockchain) that states what amount of Bitcoin currently belongs to every Bitcoin address in existence.
The private key is what is required in order to spend entries in the ledger that belong to your addresses.  The private keys allow you to make new entries in the ledger to spend your coins and assign them to a new address.
Where it gets really special... a receiving address, despite the fact that your wallet might display it to you, is COMPLETELY unknown to the Bitcoin network until somebody actually sends coins to it.  Up to that point, the address only exists in your wallet.
That means you can actually do things like generate Bitcoin addresses / private keys completely offline and have somebody send Bitcoin to that address even though you created it offline and never connected it to the Bitcoin blockchain yourself.  Hell, if you really really wanted to, you could actually generate a Bitcoin public and private keys using nothing more than a piece of paper and a pencil if you are capable of doing all the math behind it yourself.  
So to answer your question... yes Bitcoin in a sense is always online despite your wallet being on or offline.  Somebody could send Bitcoins to an address you have only stored on a piece of paper and it can sit there for years until you decide to spend that Bitcoin using the associated private key and broadcasting a transaction to the network.

Scarcity and Utility.  As long as something that is scarce and useful for something, it will have value.  People have been working on making Bitcoin useful by letting you buy things with it for years.  It is becoming more and more scarce as people are seeing that utility and wanting a piece of it for themselves.  The later is likely what is driving the price up rapidly lately as the usefullness has not changed that much recently.  When Lightning goes live however, the usefullness side of the equation is hopefully going to start going up rapidly.


There are many types of forks, however the ones you are likely referring to are likely easier to understand as a split.  If a group of people decide they want to change the rules of Bitcoin while the rest of the network does not, they can create a fork.  Think of it like we are all walking down a path in the woods, you come to a split in the path.  A group decides to take the path to the right, while the others decide to go on the left path.  Whichever group is considered the minority is considered as having created a new coin/token/fork/split.  Any coin that you controlled along the path before the split happened can actually take both paths.  In this sense, you end up with 2 coins, one will likely still be called Bitcoin, the other will be whatever the minority group decides to call it.  You will double your coins/tokens, but you are very unlikely to double your money.  In theory creating forks/splits will devalue the main Bitcoin path and transfer some wealth to the minority chain.  Take for example the Bitcoin Gold fork that recently happened.  Bitcoin today is worth $16k each, Bitcoin Gold is worth $263/each.  If you owned 1 BTC before the split, then after the split you own 1 BTC and 1 BTG.


Yes, you can have your private keys in as many places as you want and they can all control your coins.  Just make sure you only put them in places you absolutely trust.  Anybody with your private key can steal your money and you have zero hope of getting it back.

Block size and mining gear are unrelated.  A ASIC miner doesn't have a mempool like a full node does.  The ASIC does nothing but (in BTC's case) generate SHA256 hashes over and over and over again.  Also, ability to mine with even the most high end of general purpose computers went out the window probably 5 years ago when SHA256 ASICs hit the market, they made GPU mining obsolete almost overnight, and GPU mine had previously made CPU mining obsolete overnight.

Fees are completely market driven.  If you put a cap on a TX fee then you are essentially turning the TX confirmations into a lottery.  That certainly might be viewed as favorable right now in general.  However consider this... what would you do if your brother needs BTC to pay for a flight from the other side of the world because they are the only transplant match for your liver or kidney and the operation needs to happen in the next 12 hours otherwise you die?  
Fees being unlimited allows people to tell the network how much of a priority their transaction is.
The fees are definitely hurting adoption to Bitcoin right now.  There is a lot of exciting things coming in 2018 though that should help.  Hopefully sooner rather than later.

Definitely not.  In fact, right now, i would even support a doubling of the blocksize.  However I would want to support it as a temporary short-term measure just to buy some time for those that are working on better scaling solutions.
That said... its basically pointless to think that is even an option because realistically it would take a minimum of 6 months to implement a low-risk hard fork as the network is just too big to do it any quicker without a high risk of causing a chain split.  So unless things like Lightning are &gt; 6 months out, I think this not worth the time to even think about.
The only way I'd support a hardfork to decrease blocksize would if:
1. Its needed to solve a major problem.
2. Its not seen as going to cause more/bigger problems than its going to solve.
I can't think of a situation where both would be true.  Certainly right now a smaller block size would cause huge problems and I can't think of a problem it would solve that would outweigh that.

You sign up for an account with QuadrigaCX, you probably have to verify your identity with them in order to cash out (not sure).
Once you have an account there and possibly have it verified... you go onto QuadrigaCX, say you want to fund your XBT account, it will give you a deposit address.  You then log into your Coinbase account and say you want to withdraw your BTC/XBT (not sure waht they call it), it will ask for the amount and the address.  You put in the max amount, and the address that QuadrigaCX gave you and click submit/withdraw/OK/whatever.
It might take a bit to show up in your QuadrigaCX account.  Not sure how coinbase handles their withdrawls.  Alot of exchanges batch them to go say every 5 or 10 mins.  You then need to wait for the BTC network to confirm the transaction a few times.  I'm assuming coinbase will give you a transaction ID that you can monitor on the blockchain when they send the TX though.

Segwit adoption is going slow.  As far as "dropping", perhaps so, but I think it also depends on how you look at it.  I haven't done any kind of chain analysis to show anything one way or another, but consider this...
Coinbase is a major player / leader of the American BTC market.  They have also been talking lately about how they are signing up like 100k users/day for the last maybe couple months.
Coinbase (and some other Exchanges) do not yet support Segwit.  That means all of those new users coming in through Coinbase and transacting in and out of Coinbase are not preforming Segwit transactions even if they want to.
So here is how you can skew the stats to fit your narrative, using some obviously fake but easy to get numbers.
Lets say Bitcoin has 100 users.
10 of those users are activing using Segwit and only transacting with people that support Segwit.
You can say this has 10% adoption level.
Now bring in somebody like Coinbase and say they are signing up 1 new user each day.
Each day that passes as Coinbase adds 1 new user, the support level for Segwit could be said to be declining to:
1. 9.9% (10/101)
2. 9.8% (10/102)
3. 9.7% (10/103)
4. 9.62% (10/104)
5. 9.52% (10/105)
6. etc. etc.  
This all despite the fact that there are still the original 10 supporting Segwit.  You can spin this in many ways... Segwit support is falling (on a % of transaction basis).  Segwit support is holding strong (on a # of people supporting Segwit basis), etc.  
You could very very easily say that the Segwit % is dropping because Coinbase (and some other Exchanges) are not yet supporting it.   The % is dropping because the entry and exit points to the BTC network don't support it yet.   This forces their customers to not support it by continuing to use that Exchange, or the customer must move to another Exchange.   This is way oversimplified of course as there is just way too many variables to consider.
Of course also keep in mind that 99% of those new users also don't even have a clue what Segwit is.

Tracking BTC addresses as a means for determining wealth distribution doesn't really work.  It can only tell you an address is rich or not rich.  Now consider that many of those big addresses are actually exchanges, which you have zero insight into who they owe and how much.  Also consider that many people that are Bitcoin rich will have many addresses there wealth is spread across.  You could have somebody with 10k BTC and they could have all of that BTC broken up into addresses that only old .1 each.

Every tx sent on the Bitcoin network has a fee that is paid to the miners to confirm it.  Normally it's very low, but there is limited space in every block and right now the block space is quite expensive.  There is a solution to this in the pipeline but it's not yet gone live.
You are right that it is typically not advised to leave money on an exchange.  Personally I'd feel fine leaving $100 there though.  Everybody has their own point of view on this though.

I personally have trouble supporting bitpay but it's purely for ideological reasons.  I have a problem with how they positioned themselves and tried to influence the whole segwit2x fiasco.
That being said... If you are looking to take donations or receive crypto funds and want to turn it into fiat they are probably your best and maybe only choice if you want it as automated as possible and want the conversation to fiat to be instant.  You of course could just setup a BTC wallet and exchange it on quadrigacx or coinsquare for fiat, but you would have to be transferring an executing the trades manually.  Something like bitpay is the way to go of you want a similiar experience to how accepting debit or credit cards is.  It's also likely the easiest sales pitch to your treasurer and board of directors because it will be seen as the safest option in the event that BTC devalues from the time it's received to the time it's converted to CAD.

They get both when they find a new block.  The block reward coins (currently 12.5 per block) is essentially incentive for new miners to start up.  The reward cuts in half every 4 years until eventually no new Bitcoin will be mined.  This happens in roughly 120 years.   At that time, the only reward for mining a block will be the transaction fees.


Mining requires specialized hardware to be even remotely competitive these days.  Mining Bitcoin with even the most high end general computing equipment will likely not even earn you a penny per year and that doesn't take into consideration electricity costs.

A very simple explanation... they are looking for an output from a hash function that meets the pre-specified criteria.
In the case of Bitcoin, its looking for a SHA256 hash output that when you take data from the last block and add some random number, it produces a hash output that has a certain number of zeros at the start of it.  The number of zeroes is determined by the current difficulty.
The miners essentially keep running the hash function with different random numbers until the output of it has enough zeroes. When they find the right number, they get the privilege of adding a block to the blockchain, which according to the rules, awards them a certain amount of BTC + all TX fees paid for transactions they included in their block.

I assume you mean blockchain.info?
I haven't used them in many years.  if I recall, they do claim that your wallet is encrypted and they do not contain the decryption password and thus your Bitcoins are essentially safe.  So... it comes down to if you trust that statement or not.
Make sure you have a backup of the wallet so you are not dependent on their service to access your funds.

Gdax is a trading exchange that is owned and operated by coinbase.
Think of it like this.  Gdax is like a farmer's market where people in your community gather and sell things to each other.  Coinbase is that guy that goes to the farmers market and puts farmers market items in their convenience store and jacks up the price to you for the convenience of not going to the market yourself.
The only difference is that since this is all digital.. coinbase doesnt have to run to the market and buy in bulk every once in awhile.  They can go and buy your order instantly when you ask for it in the convenience store.

My node has about 105k TXs in mempool.
Did you restart your node?  because that would reset your own mempool.
As for banned peers, there are alot of reasons.  Generally if a node misbehaves in some way it will get temporarly or permanently banned from your node.  The more nodes that ban it, the less impact that bad node has on the network.  For example, if a node sends you a large peer list despite your node saying it already has alot of peers it is consider misbehaving.  THis is because they could be trying to encourage your node to connect to untrustworthy peers and get your peer to trust them over the rest of the network.

In general centralizing is kind of bad depending on your perspective of course... but what is most important is that centralization does not happen at the base layer (Bitcoin network).  If the bottom layers are centralized then you cannot regain decentralization on the higher up layers.  Reality is there is already some layer 2 centralization.  Those are what we call Exchanges today.  They are essentially a layer 2 centralized Bitcoin application.  Billions of dollars of Bitcoin can be traded on these exchanges without a single transaction hitting the Bitcoin blockchain.  They are just trading IOU notes that are really backed by nothing.  Lightning at least makes those transactions backed by actual Bitcoin that nobody can cheat anybody out of and run off with.
Having "Payment Hubs" with Lightning is not required, I personally just think its something that is likely to happen... because as you are already thinking about, opening and closing channels with every vendor could be costly and cumbersome.  The hope is that hubs are not really needed that much and that things really go alot more peer to peer, but hubs could also prove valuable too.  THey could put a completely new spin on how things like brand / store loyalty cards work or give financial incentives to "buy local" type movements.

I'll just say I disagree with Luke-Jr if he said this.  I will definitely not be the first Core supporter to disagree with him.  Many people disagree with him on many things, including other Core developers.  I think that Luke-Jr is an extreme idealist.  I think his heart is always in the right place, but that his head is not.  Okay so that out of the way... Yeah, Segwit transactions should get a fee discount, that incentivises people using it, which is good for the entire network.


I'm happy you have taken a different approach on this "technical debt" issue that is often spewed out and put it into proper context.  Yeah, the code implementation in Core is heavy for it and something may need to be fixed.  However, the average person, exchange, or vendor using the Bitcoin network doesn't need to have any expertise in how Segwit actually works or how to write code to produce or process Segwit transactions.  That is why there is a team (Core) that worries about the actual network, so other people can focus on their business that makes use of the network.  Just like a business has no clue at all how Visa or Mastercard processes transactions.  Its not important to them, all they need to know is if they swipe a customers Visa card that the money will be in their bank account.  So... Yes, there is technical debt, but its debt to the Core developers and anybody else that wishes to make a Bitcoin node implementation.


This is not a con to Segwit.  Incase you haven't noticed, Bitcoin's primary scaling solution is to take some/many transactions off-chain.  That is the direction its going, so something not being an on-chain solution is completely irrelevant.  Doing something like what BCH did and just increases the blocksize is not a long term solution either.  Its a short term solution.  How many tx/s can BCH handle?  How many does Visa handle?  Not even close to the same realm... something else is needed.


The history of a feature can hardly be considered a con.  Just because people predicted the adoption rate would not be fast does not mean the technology itself is inherently bad.  Just because something is not easy does not mean its not right.


I would further your argument and say the veto power goes back to the customers of those services.  If the customers want something and the business doesn't provide it... the business is going to find themselves first going stagnant and then shrinking as new entrants to the market swoop in to fill the gap.

Perhaps he wasn't talking about blockchain volume and was instead talking about exchange volume?  Keep in mind that exchanges are essentially layer 2 applications of Bitcoin.

Traders can manipulate the Bitcoin market without ever actually owning a single Bitcoin private key.

Core does at least support P2SH-P2WPKH segwit transactions already.  You do have to use the RPC / command line interface to generate them... but for any service provider like an Exchange that relies on Core in its backend this is a complete non-issue.
Its definitely an issue for users as expecting them to do P2SH-P2WPKH address generation using a command line interface is not realistic for 99% of people.  However, there probably are not that many people that actually use Core as their everyday wallet.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:39:07
I agree that a larger blocks would be a nice short term solution.  However, its not that easy to implement.  Increasing blocksize requires a hard fork of the network.  In general, all hard forks are dangerous to the network as they can cause chain splits and people can lose money.  The only way to reduce the risk of chain splits when a hard fork is called for, is to give A LOT of notice for all nodes on the network to upgrade.  Like **minimum** 6 months kind of notice.

Reality is, first and foremost, NOBODY knows what the price is going to do.  Bitcoin is exceptionally volatile both in ups and downs.  It could go up 5k overnight and people would be excited... but not shocked.  It could also drop 3k and nobody would be talking about it because its not abnormal.
That is a normal day in Bitcoin.  Today however, is not a normal day.  The CBOE launched its Bitcoin futures product tonight and trading went live at 6PM EST.  This is the beginning of Bitcoin having a legitimate interface to institutions with very deep pockets.  Those deep pockets however really do not give a shit about Bitcoin or what its trying to accomplish.  Those pockets are just after money.  These are people that have the capital to seriously swing the market in either direction and nobody knows what will happen again.

Yes, but don't expect an instant lowering of fees.  It will take time for merchants to integrate lightning.  Lightning is a pretty fundamental change to how digital payments will occur and it's likely to spawn new business types.  You might find things like regional payment hubs that startup.  Or some other type of group hub.  So instead of opening a payment channel directly to your local Starbucks, you might open one with say a local university payment hubs that has channels open already with places  and gives you a discount for using that hub. 
It's a completely new concept and lots of new software will need to be written to integrate it existing software.

I find QuadrigaCX often always has a premium on BTC price.  Last couple weeks were an exception though where it was actually at a discount instead.

Just to also add about Lightning... yes I do personally anticipate that we will see payment hubs of some nature.  I don't think thats all of a bad thing.  I think it could be an interesting new way for things like brand loyalty cards to adapt to crypto or things like being a member of a group (like say a student at a local university) to get discounts for shopping at certain vendors.
I don't think it will end up just being spoke-hub-spoke.  You will see alot of spoke-hub-hub-hub-hub-spoke.  THis will help greatly reduce the number of payment channels needed.

My estimate requires enough to be using it to bring the average transaction volume to a level below what the network is capable of processing.  
So yes, it requires more than just them.
It doesn't necessarily require all using segwit... Coinbase implementing transaction batching would go along way to helping the network as well.  Sending 1 tx for every outgoing payment is outright stupid for a big exchange

Yes, as long as a channel is open, you have some funds tied up in that channel.  However, we are likely going to see the formation of some kind of payment hub.  These could be regional based, or really any kind of group you can imagine... maybe your local college/university runs a student payment hub.  In that model, you will have a channel open with the hub and the hub will have channels open with vendors that are somehow related to that hub.  So... say you live in Smithville, there might be a "Smithville Payment Hub", "Smithville Payment Hub" in turn has channels open with the local grocery store, coffee shop, pet food store, conveneince stores, etc.  You in turn only need to open a channel with the "Smithville Payment Hub" to gain access to every channel that they have open.  "Smithville Payment Hub", might also have a channel open to the neighboring town of "Nowheresville", which then has channels open with local vendors.  So yes, you have some funds tied up for keeping a channel open... but you don't have to be opening channels with every single person you want to transact with.  A real ideal situation is there is no payment hubs and it goes more denctralized than that... but reality is it probably won't end up that way.


Yes, Lightning network routes from peer to peer trying to find the cheapest path available for you.  So again thinking to my previous example... say you are a student in Smithville, you goto Smithville College.  Smithville has a city-wide payment hub, Smithville College Student Union also has a payment hub, you have channels open with both.  Vendors maybe give a discount or charge less fees for using Student Union hub, so Lightning will automatically route you through the Student Union Hub.


Bitcoin Cash was forked from Bitcoin before SegWit was activated.  However Bitcoin Cash people think that SegWit is the devil and makes Bitcoin code too complicated the way it was implemented (soft fork vs. hard fork).  You'll hear them throw around the term "technical debt".


Most people believe that blocksize will need to increase at some point.  It would certainly be useful at this very moment, but proper Segwit adoption using bech32 addresses and Lightning networking going live may show that it was not needed yet.  Larger blocks are "bad" because they increase the amount of data storage a node needs, increases processor time needed to validate the transaction within a block, and increases network propagation time which can lead to more orphaned blocks - which can result in people losing money.


They did not re-mint anything.  Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have a shared transaction history.  Think of it like this... the blockchain is like a path in the forest, except instead of moving forward one step at a time forward, when you receive a transaction your transaction always appears at the furthest most point that anybody has been down that path and everytime a new block is found a little bit more of the path is discovered.  When you then spend that money you received, you are instantly teleported from where you entered the path to again the furthest point that the path has now been discovered.  A fork, like Bitcoin Cash, its like a group of people deciding that they want to diverge off the path the majority are on and take a different branch on the path.  From that moment forward anybody that wants to join the blockchain has to decide which path they want to take.  Something special happens for all of the transation that existed on the path before the split however.  They don't have to choose which path to enter, they can actually take both paths simultaneously.  
I hope that makes sense...

There are ways to do it.  For example BTC could move to having dual pow algorithms during a transition period.  For example bring in a new pow, allow dual algorithms for 5 years before deprecating the original.  That gives miners a long transition time to move to new hardware.  Anything 5 years old  in mining is typical obsolete and not worth running anyways so it shouldn't cause too much uproar.

I'm glad to see it appears to have happened alot quicker than I would have thought.
This *could* be just a multisig addresses, but that wouldn't really make sense for a simple deposit address.  This was previously a 1* addresses up until very recently.
They have added Segwit support without even an announcement or blog post about it despite this being a hot topic in the Bitcoin community.  I thought they deserved some recognition for their work.

I'll give a very high level version of it.  This is going to be a very mild lesson in cryptography.  Bitcoin makes heavy use of something called Public Key Cryptography.  In this type of system there are 2 keys, a public key and a private key.  Just as the names imply, the public key is generally public knowledge and the private key is private knowledge that only you should know.
How this is useful and how it applies to Bitcoin... forget about Bitcoin for a moment.  Lets say you want to send me a message and you don't want anybody else to be able to read it except for me.  I tell you what my public key is, which is essentially a series of 1s and 0s.  You take your message and my public key, and you run them through a pre-determined algorithm (encryption algorithm).  The algorithm spits out a bunch of data that to anybody that gets it, just looks like a bunch of garbage data.  You then send this data to me, I take that data and my private key and run it through a decryption algorithm and your original message is decoded from the seemingly garbage data.  Only the private key can be used to unlock the original message.  Not even you can unlock the message you created.  Another thing Public Key Encryption can do, is allow you to sign messages.  You can create a message and add a digital signature to it using your private key, which again, looks like garbage data.  However, anybody with knowledge of your public key is able to take the message, the digital signature, and your public key and prove that it was infact your private key that signed the message as creating that signature is nearly impossible without knowledge of the private key.
Now consider this, a Bitcoin transaction is essentially just a crytptographically signed message, all of these messages are posted into a public ledger where anybody can see it.  Whenever you "send" Bitcoin, you are really just signing a message that says "I own this Bitcoin address, and I transfer X Bitcoins to &lt;new address&gt;"  This message is posted in the clear but it has a digital signature on it that could only be created using your private key and anybody can verify that it was infact you that transferred Bitcoin from your address to the new one and they only need your public key in order to verify it.
So that was probably waaay more than you wanted to know.  I hope it made sense though.  I'll explain a little more that applies directly to you.
The "seed" you have, this is basically a series of words that can be used to algorithmatically generate your private / public keys.  With knowledge of your seed words, and the order they go in, you can re-create all of your private keys in the event that you lost the private keys.  The "seed" is a private key of sorts, it absolutely should not be shared with anybody unless you have 100% trust they will not steal your money.  They can use it to gain access to ALL private keys that were generated using that seed, not just a single address.
If you really want to see your private keys in Electrum, you can export them.  Wallet -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Export.  I highly recommend against doing this however unless you know how to take proper precautions to protect them (assuming they control funds).

That is a question for whatever exchange you bought it through.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:15:51
I don't mean to be Debbie Downer here but.... what you are likely looking at is not increased adoption.  What you are mostly likely seeing is transactions from exchanges that don't support segwit (like Coinbase) has slowed during the weekend/Christmas holiday.  There is no way it would increase 4% in 24 hrs without something major doing segwit by default.  You'll know for sure if you start seeing this decrease again starting tomorrow - or Tuesday since tomorrow is a holiday as well in North America at least.
To me, this just reinforces how important it is to get exchanges to start adopting Segwit.  You can see the large impact they can have.
A serious push towards exchanges and wallets supporting bech32 would go along way too.  Any time a transaction occurs to a bech32 address means the next transaction from that address will be segwit automatically.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:31:20
Its a difficult question to answer as there are just too many choices in software to give a completely accurate answer.
However... I don't know of any wallet or service that will not recognize a payment sent TO one of its own addresses regardless of where it came from.
So ---
bc1 -&gt; 1*, 3*, bc1* should be fine.
1*, 3*, bc1* -&gt; bc1* will be heavily dependent on the recieving end supporting this.  However, if they give you a bc1* address to send to, then obviously they do support it.

If this is true, its actually pretty genius of the miners.
Spam the network with low fee TXs so that the average person has to spend alot more... then keep spamming up, confirm your own low fee TXs that other miners might not be doing (unless they are doing the exact same thing).  You confirm your own TXs essentially wasting blockspace, you get your money back and your TX fee back since you mined it.  You then include a certain % of higher fee TXs to collect the reward but not so many that the pressure doesn't get reduced.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:08:08

@_date: 2017-12-10 13:07:38
It's a good thing because they produce the smallest sized transactions possible right now.  However the bech32 BIP has not yet been officially approved yet so it's not that widely supported yet.  Electrum 3 uses them be default.  Ledger has stated they will be supporting them with an update to their software I think in Q1.  Not sure about others.

You *CAN* leave them on QuadrigaCX, but you shouldn't.
By leaving them there, you are entrusting QuadrigaCX to not lose your money.  Its like asking your uninsured friend to store your cash in their house.  If somebody breaks into their house, they might steal your money, or if their house burns down your cash is gone.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:21:44
It would actually be more than half, assuming transaction volume does not change.  If everybody were making segwit transactions then the rate at which TXs could be confirmed would be higher than the rate at which TXs are being created.  This means that within a day or so, the blocks would not be full any longer .  As long as blocks are not full then fees will approach zero, because a tx that even pays 0.5 cents pays more than leaving block space empty.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:39:51
They probably knew alot of people wanted to sell their BCH to buy other coins.
Doing it this way allows them to collect trade fees going into USD and collect more fees for going from USD -&gt; whatever.
If they had allowed direct BTC -&gt; BCH trades it would have diminished their revenue.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:55:04
Running a node will not affect transaction fees at all.  Transaction fees are directly related to block space.  
There are only 2 ways to solve that...
1. Increase the available block space (requires a hard fork)
2. Decrease the amount of data going into a block
There are ways (like Segwit) to achieve  without reducing the transaction volume.

Don't quote me.... but I believe if you disable Dynamic Fees in Electrum and then specify what fee/byte you want to use somewhere in the preferences menu, that it will use that fee structure when sweeping the private key.
I'm speaking for the desktop version of Electrum, no idea about mobile.

Just make sure you have a backup copy of your seed / private keys.  If your old phone dies you lose access to your BTC without that backup.
You are probably fairly safe.  IMO, it doesn't make sense to buy a hardware wallet like a nano s until you have say &gt; $1k of BTC.
Also keep in mind that hardware wallets are most useful if you are actively transacting in BTC.  If all you are going to do is cold storage for your BTC, a ledger or trezor provides zero benefit over an encrypted paper wallet.

The bigger thing is I don't think people realize that it would take **minimum** 6 months to implement a 2x hardfork safely.  Its pretty simple code change, but you need to give ALOT of time for services, miners, and full nodes to upgrade and have a vast majority of them onboard to not cause chain splits, which will result in people losing money.

If it's a small amount of crypto, I'd store it on a desktop wallet.  I like electrum personally. 
If it's a larger amount and you will be needing to send from your wallet easily, get a hardware wallet like a ledger nano s or trezor.
If it's a bigger amount and you just plan to sit on it for a long time, then a paper wallet is fine.
No matter what option, make sure you backup your recovery seed and not just a copy in your home.  Store another copy elsewhere,

I would agree that majority of people don't have a plan-b in place.  
However I would probably say a majority of coins do have a plan b in place.  Mainly because those that hold larger sums are more likely to plan for those coins future because they are well aware of their value.
Personally... The seed for my cold wallet is known to my wife and we have multiple copies in secure, geographically distant places.  She doesn't know how to make use of those seed words, but she is well aware of their value.  She knows that if I were to die to never touch them unless she has help from somebody that can be trusted 100% and it's from somebody that she trusts has sufficient knowledge of Bitcoin.
I don't really feel like this is even good enough as there is a fair good chance if I were to die from unnatural causes there is sufficient probability that she would be with me and die as well.  I would want the coin to pass down if that were to happen.. or to other immediate family members if we were all gone.
Our family is relatively small and our child is far too young to be entrusted with maintaining a key, even a multisig key.  
I am considering setting up an X of Y key vault and giving a key to each family member.  That way as long as X keys are present they can gain access.

Care to explain to a very novice trader wannabe?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:55:28
I basically agree with everything you've said - except perhaps a different use-case.
I mean the use-case for BTC, BCH, LTC, and others is all peer-to-peer payment system.  People can throw out their memes about what each might appear to be currently, ie calling BTC just a store-of-value.  BTC might not be doing very well at being a payment system right now compared to others, but it is still the intention.   I think its important to keep in mind that the catalyst for BTC's current problems is actually its success outpacing expectations.  They were even trying to get prepared for this by bringing in Segwit *a lot* earlier, but miners were delaying it.  Ironically miners are right now getting basically what they wanted.
I conceptually agree with the way that BTC is doing things - that is introducing layers.  I think it provides for a much better future.  The timing of how its all going down is pretty unfortunate for BTC though.  I don't think that's really the developers fault.
At any rate, I don't see a difference in the use-case between LTC and BCH when looking at it in the current environment.  The only major difference between them is Segwit.
If you want my 2 cents as to why BCH actually happened compared to those people just moving to LTC.... it was because the miners were voicing their opinions and people started viewing some of them more as leaders instead of just people that work in the back room (which is totally fine, they should show some leadership as they are an important part of the network).  Of course Bitcoin miners wouldn't want to move to LTC because their massive investments in SHA256 mining equipment cannot be used with LTC.
I do agree the BCH is certainly a success from a short-sighted perspective.  However I think in the long run its just going to cause more harm than good to the larger crypto community and slow down adoption of crypto as a whole.  The same could be said for most altcoins... but an altcoin that starts from scratch and a Bitcoin (*the* crypto leader) contentious fork that divides the community are *very* different animals.  Lastly, as you said, trying to co-opt the Bitcoin brand in the process is just rubbing salt into the wound and causes alot of confusion for new entrants to the ecosystem... which again, slows mainstream adoption.
EDIT: added () clarification about miner leadership.

Yes, in the exact same sense that doing online banking is "Online cash".
If Coinbase closed up shop tonight what would happen to your BTC?  it would be gone and you wouldn't be able to get it back.
A true Bitcoin wallet stores the private keys that control the funds directly without an intermediary.  No matter what anybody else does, they can't steal or deny you access to your BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:49:25
If the private key is on a paper wallet, you can likely just re-sweep the private key and specify a higher TX fee.  You might need to use different wallet software to do it though.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:00:09
The block discovery bonus gets cut in half every 4 years.  Eventually the block reward goes to zero (discovery bonus) + fees.  At that point, the block discovery reward is strictly the transaction fees.  If there were no fees then miners would not be able to afford to run their equipment.

Have you seen the [top sticky post](
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:42:58
Exactly.  This is what the [Bitfinex LTC/BTC chart looks like](
This is using 5 minute candles - I generally watch 1 minute ones though, but wanted to show a larger time frame in that screenshot.
Basically it goes up and down on a fairly consistent pattern, with a slight trend upward favoring LTC.  Each one of those candles that is the size of the couple on the left hand side is a trade opportunity.  You won't make a ton of coin doing this unless you have a decent sized stash to trade.  I find it relatively safe though because I believe both BTC and LTC have a future, at least certainly in the short term.  ETH and XMR are probably good choices too.  Again, the most important part is to not trade emotionally and have confidence that whatever you are buying on the dips that you believe its going to go back up.  
You might miss out on some gains on either side doing this, but again you have to just be prepared for that and not get worked up if you miss a big rise on one side or the other.  If your general plan is to just hold BTC, well if LTC rises you wouldn't have benefited from that anyways.  Swapping between the 2, maybe you get lucky and you catch a surge on the LTC side - of course it goes both ways, you could get unlucky and miss surges on both sides.  Often times some coins do surge together though, just one side more than the other so its not like you totally lose out.
EDIT: just to add - for me personally... the only way I can do non-emotional trades is to trade between 2 coins that I believe are both winners in the long run and won't be unhappy about holding for a period of time.  The FOMO doesn't hit nearly as hard this way.  FOMO trading generally always leads to you losing.
EDIT 2: I should also say... if you want to try trading, I'd highly recomend you do some research on how to read the different types of charts out there and what some of the basic market indicators are.  See if you can find a site that lets you trade with pretend coins first to see if you can get a handle on it before you put your actual coins on the line.

@_date: 2017-12-14 16:45:19
Just to add - in addition they could use a single input to pay 10 (or much more) outputs in a single TX.    I'll just use some made up numbers to illustrate the point, I don't now what the real numbers would be on average and just don't have time to look it up atm.
Lets just pretend that the costs (in terms of data size) are on a point system.
TX overhead - 1pt
1x input - 1pt
2x output (payee address + change address) - 2pts
So a regular payment takes 4 points.  
Lets say they need to pay 100 clients, its just 4x 100 points = 400 pts.
Now if you do a batch payment to 100 clients instead, and this will assume an ideal situation of only requiring a single input, which is not likely to be true in many cases.
TX overhead - 1pt
1x input - 1pt
101x outputs (100 payee addresses + change address) - 101pts
So a batch payment to 100 clients has a total of 103 points instead of 400 points.
Again... I've used "points" because I don't know the actual numbers for what the overhead, inputs and outputs are.  Its very likely not nearly this evenly distributed between overhead/input/outputs.  This is a huge oversimplification just to illustrate the point.  It could be significantly better than how this looks or significantly worse.  No matter what though, 1x batch transaction to pay 100 people will always be smaller than 100x transactions assuming the same inputs are used.

I'd just like to point out that segwitaddress.org does not generate native segwit (P2WPKH) addresses.  It generates P2SH-P2WPKH addresses.  A payment TO a P2SH-P2WPKH address is actually larger than a legacy P2PKH transaction, so this is actually harmful to the current block congestion issue.  I'm unsure about the difference in payments FROM a P2SH-P2WPKH address.
Bitcoin Core has actually not officially adopted the proposed address format for native P2WPKH addresses.  In all liklihood it will be [BIP173 bech32]( address format.  Some wallets, like [Electrum 3.0+]( and [Trezor firmware 1.6.0+]( currently support BIP173 addresses but Bitcoin Core does not yet.  That being said, [Bitcoin Core has merged bech32 address support into the master branch]( its just not yet included in a released version.
[Ledger has said bech32 is coming Q1 2018](

Any generalization is likely going to lead to people being praised or deomized that are undeserving of it.
When looking at things from a generalized perspective, when people were up in arms about miners they were talking about a select few that were blocking segwit activation and because ASICBOOST was discovered.  People saw this as them not acting in the best interest of the network.  However, not all miners were doing this.  Slushpool for example has generally always done what is in the best interest of the network.  So to call miners villains would be unfair to those like slushpool who were fighting the good fight.
Besides, miners play a vital role in Bitcoin.  Without them Bitcoin does not work.  If you want to demonize them and say they are all evil then don't expect them to have any loyalty at all even in the short term if something else financially enticing comes around.

I don't have an answer for you since I don't use iOS.... however I just want to point out that Coinbase is NOT a wallet app.  Its just giving you access to your funds that are stored on Coinbase's servers.  THis is the same thing as using a mobile banking app where it just grants you access to the funds in your account with them.
This is VERY different from a real mobile Bitcoin wallet where the private keys for your coins are actually stored in the app.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:45:43
That would not make it a hardware wallet.  A hardware wallet is not just a storage device.  Its a device that has the ability to sign transactions with your private keys without exposing your private keys to the computer its connected to.  That is the whole point of a hardware wallet, to keep the private keys as secure as possible.
Keeping a software wallet on a USB drive is arguably more secure than keeping it on an internet connected computer as long as the USB drive is only inserted during times of transactions... but it is still quite vulnerable to malware that might sit and wait for you to connect it.

More than likely, never.  Right now the backlog transactions being confirmed go down as far as 70 sat/B.
You might get very lucky though.  You'll need to either use Replace By Fee, or Child Pays for Parent if you want to get it confirmed quicker.
Otherwise, just wait for your wallet to allow you to re-spend the coins.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:57:06
I feel like you think I had some kind of nefarious intent by saying to post a transaction ID.  Its all public knowledge anyways and the worst its going to do is link a transaction and a couple BTC addresses to your 1 week old reddit account.
Without being able to see the transaction, people can only take wild guesses as to why your transaction was not included in a particular block.  The most likely situation though is that there were transactions with higher fees paid than yours.  "Highest priority fee" is completely meaningless since there is no authority on what fees are.  Each wallet has their own algorithm for giving fee recommendations.  One wallets "highest" option, might be another wallets "low priority" option.
There is no "honoring transactions" or "correct" fee amount, getting a transaction included in a block is essentially an auction system.  Miners will typically include transactions that allow them to maximize the fee per byte of blockspace.  If the current fee estimates say you need to pay 10 sat/byte to get in immediately, but before a block is found a bunch of 15 sat/byte transactions get broadcast, then they essentially jumped the queue and bumped you back.  Its not a flaw.

Banks will continue to exist, they will just be forced to adapt and likely become less relevant than they are today.
They will likely still have a place as being a lending institution.  You might deal alot less with big name banks as an average Joe and see the move to a new type of credit union.
Loans in general will continue to be backed by legal contract with the lender just like they are today.  However, since Bitcoin is programmable and things like Rootstock will take that to a completely different level... you could have something like a smart contract with the lender that automatically deducts from an account at predetermined milestones to pay the lender.

"18 months" is a meme.  It was delayed and delayed because Bitcoin first needed Segwit activated for lightning to work.  Nobody knew if Segwit would actually get activated or not, so why would Lightning developers waste there time working on something that might never happen.  Segwit activating was a huge political drama and was by no means the fault of the developers.  They had it ready a very long time ago, it was largely miners refusal to support it that caused the delay.
Lightning has a release candidate of the specification that came out about 2 weeks ago.  A specification might not sound like a big deal... but keep in mind there are already 3 completely separate pieces of software that conform to that spec that are all passing 100% integration tests.  The day the specification is "released" those applications can launch on mainnet in mass.
Lightning has actually already been used on mainnet by the developers and shown that it works and it works cross-implementation on mainnet.  It is not far way at this point.  You could use lightning today if you really wanted to - but you'll have a tough time finding a vendor that is going to support it due to its non-released status.
Beside that... there are other things coming besides lightning.  Schnorr signatures coming which will help reduce transaction size for multisig transactions by a significant amount, MAST is coming to give new uses to Bitcoin, ZeroLink was just announced a couple days ago which I had no idea was coming, Rootstock is in a beta phase on mainnet right now and I'm sure there are many others I'm missing.

You seem to really be waaaay over thinking things.  My comment was simply that if you look at every prediction that people have made regardless of their knowledge of the subject, you'll find predictions all over the map.  Thus somebody making a correct prediction does not necessarily automatically mean whatever method or model they may have used to predict the price was any more accurate than somebody that just pulled a number out of their ass.  They both could have been equally as lucky.

The price differences between the exchanges I find can fluctuate alot.  Recently we've seen Bitfinex and Bitstamp trail GDAX by as much as 2k (although i personally think this was an anomaly and was caused by GDAX's system failing).  Even right now there is a $300 difference between GDAX and Bitfinex.  Bitstamp is basically dead in the center between them.
I'm sure it takes a little know-how with how to read the order books and be able to gauge the liquidity of each market individually.  
This is basically the whole point of a sell wall though.  Suppress the price in the leading (price wise) market so you can buy cheaper where the price hasn't caught up yet.

Each node has their own independent mempool where unconfirmed transactions are stored. 
So a couple things, each node can also refuse to put a transaction in its mempool for whatever reason or remove it for whatever reason.
The node could also get restarted which will flush the mempool and it starts over and may never seen your TX again.
I am surprised that your tx never got confirmed at 115 sat/byte.  It chewed threw all of those transactions last night for sure.
You might want to try rebroadcasting the TX with your wallet assuming it lets you do that.

The whole point of a hardware wallet is to not expose your private keys at all  to a computer.  The transaction is signed directly on the hardware wallet to do this.  
An encrypted usb drive, while being far better than having a wallet file sitting directly on a computer, it's not the same level of protection as a hardware wallet.
Also, the trust you put into trezor or ledger is essentially the same as the trust you put into a piece of wallet software.  If you don't trust trezor or ledger though, you can use a hardware wallet for signing transactions created in electrum.  In that way you have a segregation of duties and both electrum and the hardware wallet have to lie to you in order to steal from you.

What naturally happens... when the cost to mine begins to exceed the reward, miners will stop mining.  When some miners stop mining, the mining difficulty decreases which makes it easier to find blocks which means the miners that are still running start earning more income to make it profitable for them.  In this way... its essentially a self-balancing system.


Its obviously pretty hard to predict where we will be in 120 years from now.  Its hard to imagine that mining will not evolve in some way.  However the belief is that transaction fees will be enough to sustain a miners income.  Blocks over the last year have contained anywhere from 0.4 BTC ($6,400 USD) to 7 BTC ($115,000 USD) in just transaction fees alone.  So there is defnitely incentive to run miners strictly for confirming transactions.  
However again... its hard to imagine that mining will not change in *some* way in the next 120 years... we barely even had electricity 120 years ago, so what the next 120 years looks like is kind of unimaginable.

In general though... capital gains is exactly what is implied in the name.  You are taxed on whatever you gained.  If you spent $3000, and you turned it into $3500, your gain is $500 and what you would pay taxes on regardless of how you acquired the $3000 originally.

Old transactions can be mined just fine.

Child pays for parent just describes the characteristics of s transaction.  It's not a special type of transaction.  Here is an example....
You have .1 BTC, you send .09 to somebody and you get .01 sent to your change address. You paid 0 fee on this.
This tx does not get confirmed and you want to make it more lucrative to confirm.
You make a new tx spending the .01 on your change address, you set a high tx fee, high enough that if you took all the bytes from the 1st tx and the 2nd tx that the fee per total bytes is high enough that a  miner will confirm both TXs to get the fee on the 2nd tx.
This is called child pays for parent because w miner cannot confirm the 2nd tx without also confirming the 1st tx because the 2nd tx contains an unconfirmed output from the 1st tx.
Hope that makes sense.

I primarily use QuadrigaCX, but I'm Canadian. Coinbase does operate here but they have limitations. For example coinbase does not allow you to withdraw CAD, also for the purposes of buying, they are typically more expensive than QuadrigaCX.  When a time comes that I want to withdraw any kind of serious amount of CAD, I'll likely look to whatever the cheapest and trustworthy method is at that time.  Canadians don't really have alot of great options.  All of the exchanges here have their pros and cons... In general quadrigacx works for me since they have cad funding options that are not outrageous and they've been around enough to have earned some trust from me.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:58:40
I'm just going to answer your last part


An address is not all there is to being a transaction input.  Each transaction output becomes a new input.  This means if you have a receiving address and you receive 5 transactions on that address, now say you go to spend this funds and you need to spend the total cumulative amount you have received at that address... You are actually putting 5 inputs into the transaction, not just 1.
As an example, look at this transaction that was sent to Andreas' donation address: 
See how there is 2 inputs from the same address?
This is also why its not a good idea for small time miners to have really small payout thresholds.  It creates a lot of inputs when they go to consolidate their funds and they could end up spending a fortune on doing that consolidation.

For RBF, your tx had to be flagged for RBF before sending it.  Its not an option if it was not set beforehand.  To actually use it, it depends on your wallet.
To do a CPFP tx, basically you need to send a TX that uses one of the outputs of your unconfirmed transaction in a new transaction that pays a high fee.  The second transaction that could be a high value confirmation cannot be confirmed without also confirming the original transaction.  Again... how to do this will depend on your wallet.  Just google for "&lt;wallet name&gt; bitcoin CPFP"

Yes, it won't be perfect and by no means will it always be operate under ideal circumstances.  However even if you never had a single batched transaction that never had the opportunity to reduce the number of inputs needed, the tx will still be smaller than individual TXs using the same inputs and outputs simply because the tx overhead is shared.  It's not nearly as much as being able to reduce inputs.

The difference here is that somebody is asking for the detailed explanation.  Your scenario is about the detailed explanation being the norm.  It's not of course.  The detail is going to be over the heads of 99% of people because they are not educated in the field.  The normal level of detail is generally enough to satisfy the vast majority, but if I asked my physician for a detailed explanation for why a drug or procedure will fix my situation my doctor is either going to explain it to a level of my satisfaction or I'm going to find another physician that can.

Personally, I don't have a problem with Gavin being in favor in bigger blocks.  I don't think anybody will argue that there is a time and a place for bigger blocks and very likely they are in Bitcoin's future.  I'll also certainly admit they sure sound appealing right now given the fee situation on Bitcoin right now.  However, with that said, Bitcoin is also seeing some pretty tremendous innovation toward solving it in more efficient ways that offer a much better long term solution.  I would also make an argument that at least some of that innovation is happening because of the refusal to implement bigger blocks and the pressure that is putting on the network.  Its certainly causing some short term harm, but hopefully we can all be patient and realize it really is short term.  2018 has *alot* of great developments in store for Bitcoin.  Likely some we don't already know bout.
Ok that was a bit of a tangent... you are probably right for calling me out on referring to Gavin as a bad actor.  He is certainly an outcast, but that says more about how this community views him more than anything to do about his actual actions.  I would probably say that getting conned by CSW was his biggest mistake.  Its unfortunate because it was probably a very easy mistake to make.  He was certainly under enormous pressure from the public with the way it went down, however the way it was being done in a private manner, essentially the exact opposite of the way everything in Bitcoin happens should have been red flag

Tax laws are different in every country, so lets not assume whomever is doing it is American and has to follow their capital gains laws.  There are many countries with no capital gains taxes.
Second of all... even if they are American.  All of these transactions are recorded so its fairly easy to download a history of every single one of your transactions from most exchanges.  To add to that, people that have this level of wealth are just going to offload the problem of calculating their taxes to an accountant.  
Lastly... selling later vs selling now is just deferring when the taxes is owed.

While I'll admit my original math was not accurate.. I actually gave it too much time because I was too lazy to convert 100 mbit to 12.5 MB/s.  I just used it as 10 MB/s.  Not sure how you are getting 12 hours to do 150GB:
100 mbit = 100/8 MB/s = 12.5 MB/s
12.5 MB/s * 60 = 750 MB/min * 60 = 45,000 MB/hr * 4 hrs = 180,000 MB

Disclaimer: I heavily dislike BitPay over their involvment on Segwit2x.  I have a bias against them that makes me by default like anybody that competes against them.
It depends on how they are selling their coins (presuming they are).  Presuming they liquidate all or the majority of their BTC shortly after recieving it, they would need to send the the BTC to an exchange or another merchant service that can convert the funds to fiat.  When those funds are sent to that service provide they could transaction batch them.  However... for this business... it really depends on their volume if this is a feasible business practice or not - and I am a HUGE proponent of transaction batching saying this.  Bitcoin being exceptionally volatile *right now* means they might want to reduce their business risk as immediately as possible, which means liquidating it as quick as possible, which means not waiting to do batch transactions.
When Bitcoin is more stable or when BTC value is on without a doubt on an upward trend, both long and short term... then they can afford to transaction batch.  However the last few days I wouldn't blame them for not doing it.

They are charging to withdraw from the exchange.  That is not th same as saying how much do you want to spend for your btc transaction.  It is part of their business model.  It's like how an ATM charged you 2 or 3 $ to withdraw from an ATM that is one other than your own bank.  Reality is that tx costs a fraction of a penny to the bank.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:13:16
It was not doomed to happen . It was completely intentional.  The network cannot exist in the long run without tx fees.  As the block reward shrinks you need 1 of 2 things to happen.  Fee per byte needs to increase or numbers of txs in a block needs to increase.  Both result in total fees per block increasing.  
 Without one of those happening then miner's revenue makes it not as worthwhile for them.  There must be fees and those fees need to cover their their operating and capital costs.

Wallet providers and exchanges are fully aware of it.  You don't need an awareness campaign you just need to ask them to support it.

Sorry I meant I'd your tx would be included in the block depending on your tx fee.
At any rate, the tx fee is basically an auction, it's the amount you pay to have miners confirm your block.  In general they will always try and pick transactions with the highest amount of fees that they can fit in a block.. so the more you pay the higher your chances are they pick yours.

It would probably take a fair bit more than 10 mil to push the price around too much.  There are 1800 new BTC added to circulation daily.  That means it takes over 12 million added daily just to keep the price roughly stable - assuming all 1800 are sold.

The Bitcoin being held in this fiasco was mined before the BCH fork, therefore it's valid on both chains.  That means not only are the 200,000 BTC worth a ton on the BTC chain, it's also currently worth about $200,000,000 on the BCH network.  If he dumped the 200,000 BCH in exchange for BTC it would not only hurt BCH, it would benefit the BTC community, which is the community that for screwed by mtgox in the first place.

It depends.
Overtime with any investment, if you have 1000 to invest you are generally always best to put in 1000 right away instead of putting in 50 every week until your 1000 is gone.  That is because the growth of the investment is likely to exceed any benefit from dollar cost averaging over 20 investments over time.
However, if you don't have 1000 to put in now... Putting in 20 investments over time is better than setting it aside and saving up 1000 to invest all at once.
At the end of the day, the real answer is put in as much as early as possible to maximize long term benefit.

It is worth noting that Bitcoin has had hardforks in the past and they will almost certainly be required at some point in the future.  They have been and should be exceptionally rare on the main Bitcoin chain though.
Just for reference - [BIP50]( is the historical hardfork I'm referring to.
It is also quite likely that the blocksize will eventually be increased on the main chain at some point in the future, which as we all know, will require a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:13:29
The fork will 100% happen unless those behind b2x concede and announce their intentions to continue with Core's implementation.  At this point, the reverse is basically impossible..  that is Core conceeding and agreeing to implement 2x and have it widely distributed to production systems in time for the fork activation.

If SHA256 becomes broken where somebody can more or less instantly generate a hash to match the difficulty, it would be a critical event for BTC.  
Most exchange would immediately halt trading.  Moving your coins would be extremely dangerous.  Market confidence would PLUMMET.

At the same time, they would probably also propose a blockchain rollback to the point where the attack first took place.

I don't mind to sound like a downer but reality is you are not really helping the BTC network by mining unless you actually find a block.  I'm not going to say that's impossible...

AFAIK there is nothing on the horizon that is expecting to cause a drop.  The BCH fork did just cause a drop... however not even a week later and its fully recovered and as you are probably seeing... its looking to test its all time high today.
Even if there is a drop, you are looking at getting at the absolute most 10% more BTC.  If you don't buy right now, its anybody's guess how much you could possibly lose out on if the price soars.

They are safe.  If they were not safe, you'd see bitcoins leaving that address on the blockchain as well.
Depending on the amount... if I were you, i'd create a backup of that paper wallet somewhere.  As geographically far as you can get it away from your safe.
When you decide you want to sell your Bcash or Bgold, you will need to split your coins.  Its relatively easy for both since they have replay protection.  
Essentially you will send your BTC to a new BTC wallet.
You then import your private key into a BCH wallet, send the coins to a new BCH address
You then import your private key into a BTG wallet, send the coins to a new BTG address.
At this point your coins are completely split into their own wallets and all have their own private keys.

ISPs are actually going to be harmed in the long run if net neutrality is killed off.  All its going to accomplish is pushing forward more encryption.  Data that ISPs can currently spy on and data mine will become inaccessible to them in the future because use of VPN or other forms of encryption is just going to rise and that data will become inaccessible to them.
Even usage of things like ToR will rise and the network might even get to a point where its not incredibly slow for general purpose usage.  
All of these things will actually be bad for ISPs, and they will be bad for law enforcement agencies who can currently track people not using these kinds of services very easily.

THe issue is simple... the value of BTC has been rising so sharply that it is getting the attention of investors and not just hobbyist.  Investors bring in money to the system alot faster.
Also not everybody buying &amp; holding right now is in it just for the price increases.  Lots of people are buying it and holding it for the future when it will be more useful.
With how quickly the price is rising, its pretty hard to blame anybody for sitting on it.  Depending on where you live, a single Bitcoin purchased about a year ago was enough to pay for rent for a month.  Today that same Bitcoin can pay for almost a year.

Bitcoin is not stored in the wallet.  Everybodies Bitcoin is stored in the blockchain that anybody can download and view.  What is stored in your wallet is the keys needed to reassign (spend) your bitcoins to a different address.
You can have 500 wallets all with the same keys or 5 billion it doesn't matter.  All of them will show they have access to the same balance.  If you spend the coin from one wallet it shows as spent on all wallets that contain those keys.

When it breaks 10k, I think one of 2 things will happen... a sharp but short dip, maybe 9500 or 9000 then creeps back up. OR A sharp rise towards 10.5 - 11.0k followed by a correction down to 10.1 - 10.2k.
As soon as media attention - like 6 o'clock news, morning newspaper, etc. starts to hit the masses and they see BTC has broken 10k, you can expect some rapid gains.
This all coming from somebody who has no business doing price predictions.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:54:34
Yes something is only worth what someone will pay.. but the point is it's the holders of the asset that determine what the price is.  If all Bitcoin asset holders refuse to sell for less than 100k then that is the new price.  That of course does not mean that the value of Bitcoin is 100k however.  Price and value are very different things.

Better than what?
If you want to ensure you get your B2X tokens after the fork you just need to either:
A) have possession of the private keys to your Bitcoins
B) have your bitcoins stored on an exchange that you trust &amp; has said they will provide access to both BTC and B2X tokens after the fork.
If you want option A, it doesn't matter what wallet you use, it only matters that you have the private keys.  Some wallets may make it easier to split your coins after the fork.  Electrum has provided instructions on how they recommend doing it.

It's very misleading to look at number of addresses holding a full coin.  Considering most wallets try to treat receiving coins as 1 time use addresses.  Yes, sure, you can receive multiple times on a single address... But most when you click receive it gives you a new address.  That means any accumulation is spread across multiple addresses. Add to this it is safer to keep coins spread out incase of a lost private key or the exceptionally unlikely event of a key collision. Then also add on that when you spend coins most wallets will use change addresses which further spreads out your coins.  Lastly.... There are ALOT of people that keep their coins in online exchanges.  NONE of those will show in your list because all of their coins are consolidated into the exchanges cold and hot wallet. That means that wallet you see that has many millions of dollars of coins in it, those coins are owed to their customers and many of them will have the rights to a full coin or more.

There is nothing intrinsically worse about a software wallet.  Hardware wallets afterall are just software running on dedicated hardware, though generally with specialized hardware.  The real issue with software wallets is that they are stored on computers connected to the internet that people do everyday browsing with and might open emails with malware or or get malware through some other vector.  The wallet software itself, in many cases, is very solid.
Edit: I personally would never have anything but a watch only, or a wallet with very little amounts on a phone though.

Right, my point though is that buying futures is not the same as buying Bitcoin.  I don't mean the method, I mean the outcome.
If you buy futures you do not get Bitcoin.  No money flows through Bitcoin and it has no *direct* effect on the cost of Bitcoin since nobody is actually acquiring (or liquidating) Bitcoin when futures are bought or sold.  I'm sure it will have some kind of indirect effect on the price, but nothing like it would if the futures were actually settled in Bitcoin.
You are definitely right though that buying, selling, and holding Bitcoin is a pain in the ass.  I mean it has gotten ALOT easier over the years, but its still not dead simple and really its way too easy for somebody to accidentally lose their fortune or have it stolen by one method or another.  Being your own bank with Bitcoin is great in general, but it does come with losing some security that banks/creditors provide.

While that % seems high to me.. I actually don't mind this at all.  Just because BTC is open and free and the developers don't profit off the TXs doesn't mean nobody should be allowed to.  If somebody makes a business model for providing some kind of service utilizing Bitcoin I think that's great.  Most exchanges take a % of trades and nobody has a problem with that.

Definitely this is a nice feature.
You could also achieve even better without a hardware wallet though.  You could have a second computer for your cold storage that is completely air gapped from the internet.  Only the air gapped machine contains the private keys (and your backup somewhere).  You then sign the transactions on the air gapped machine, copy the tx announcement over and broadcast it from an online machine.  That way your private keys never touch anything directly connected to the internet.  You'd have your wallet encrypted obviously, then use full disk encryption like BitLocker or LUKS which can be backed by TPM or smartcard.
You could even have the cold storage system connected to the internet connected system by way of a dumb connection like a serial port that only allows data one way to make broadcasting the TXs easier and remain safe.
This would be way way safer than a hardware wallet, which don't get me wrong, they are already secure.
I'm just trying to point out that software wallets in general are not bad.  It's in the way you do your additionally layers of security that make them more prone to being hacked.  Hardware wallets are really a pretty cheap way to achieve pretty good security.  
I would love to know how exchanges do it that are holding hundreds of millions of dollars in BTC.

It depends on what Papa Johns considers "Bitcoin" to be.  Nobody owns the Bitcoin brand and its up to every participant in the Bitcoin network to determine for themselves what "Bitcoin" is to them.  It appears to me that the vast majority of non-miner participants in the network consider "Bitcoin" to be Core's implementation (Segwit1x).  However if Papa John's decided to run the BTC1 code (Segwit2x), then they would consider "Bitcoin" to be Segwit2x and they would only accept Segwit2x "Bitcoin" tokens.  They would not be accepting Core's Segwit1x tokens.  The reverse is true if they run Core's Segwit1x code.
They could accept both if they want by running 2 nodes, but it would be up to Papa Johns to determine which one they call Bitcoin and which one they call whatever else.
I do not personally know anything about Papa John's stance on which one is Bitcoin.

It is not faster.  It has the same 10 minute block time as Bitcoin.  It does have more throughput currently due to larger blocks however.  Throughput and speed are not the same thing.  The fees are lower because it's not being used by nearly as many people, and yes there is room for.more TXs per block, not that it matters right now.
All that said, as soon as lightning launches its going to make bcash look  like a tricycle compared to Bitcoin being a maglev train.  Bitcoin will then have instant transactions and throughput into the millions per second compared to BCHs 24 per second.

Yes, they signed the NYA I believe.  However it is important to remember that that NYA did not force anybody to abandon what we consider to be Bitcoin (Segwit1x).  It only meant they were also going to support Segwit2x - as an exchange and wallet service, they would have been stupid to not support both like pretty much every other exchange said they would do even if they were not signatories.
I'm not really trying to defend Coinbase... i'm not a customer so I don't really care about them.

You are way too short sighted.  Segwit was not implemented to stuff more transactions into a block.  It was implemented to enable layer 2 and kill ASICBOOST.  Being able to use it to get more TXs in was just a bonus.  Big blocks like BCH implemented is just a short term bandaid.  BCH is going to be left in the dust when BTC goes live with layer 2 with regard to transaction per second throughput.  It's going to be frickin hilarious when BCH decided they need to implement segwit to try and remain relevant.

Anybody that pulls off such a hack wouldn't be stupid enough "steal all btc".  They would just steal coins from old addresses that haven't been touched for a very long time, but not ones that are known to belong to anybody.  Old addresses that mined coins but never spent them would be perfect targets.
Also rolling back the blockchain is not exactly as easy as you might think.  It would cause havoc for exchange that are holding IOUs for their customers.  They would need to be able to roll their database back to the same precise moment that the blockchain got rolled back to.  At this point, it would require a huge amount of global coordinated effort.

I don't understand why you wouldn't want to charge based on electricity.  In your original post you said something about being worried about limiting your own growth as a miner due to running out of capacity.
Why don't you just tell this person you can offer them X amount of capacity to a maximum of whatever amount.  You set the max to whatever number leaves you the amount of capacity you want for yourself.

Thanks, that was a pretty interesting read.  They have alot of really good ideas they have implemented and it's nice to see security taken so seriously.  I do have mixed feelings about them saying to log every keystroke through their bastion hosts though.  It just seems like a risk when there could easily be sensitive information being typed out which could end up in a log file where a larger group has access.

At current price and difficulty it could bring in about 700 a month before electrical costs.  
It's safe to say at these prices that we are set to see a sharp rise in mining difficulty when these are released.  These units at current difficulty pay for themselves very quickly.

It seems like we are so far away from the average person being able to run a full node it's hard to see ever getting there.  
I want to say I don't see the harm in light wallets... But I do.  In reality I'm not sure how great a risk they are. I believe that as long as there is a certain % of full nodes and a certain % of light wallet backends per user that the risk is probably exceptionally small... But this is also way out of my realm of expertise.
 I'm not sure what the solution is because running a full node at present will cause the average person to question what is so special about BTC when it takes them hours or days to download and validate the blockchain while listening to their shitty 500gb 5400rpm HDD in their i3 laptop grind away making their budget laptop run slow.

You don't have to actually put the money into Bitcoin to see the price go up.  You just need to convince the holders of the assets to not sell it at current market value.  If people place a higher value on what they already own then the price has to go up for anybody wanting to get in.  The cost of  property certainly goes up, typically faster than inflation despite people not putting any money into it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:01:11
His opinion really wasn't shitty.  I mean he was kind of rude about it... but he his advice wasn't really wrong.  Bitcoin IS a very high risk investment.  With high risk comes high reward potential though.  In this case it has paid off, it could have just as easily gone the other way.  Say USA does what China did and bans exchanges... the price would tank for the short and medium term.
I fully believe Bitcoin has a bright future, but external influences could still be catastrophic for it and could come out of nowhere with no warning signs.  That is what makes it high risk.  That is why things like CME are good for Bitcoin and why people are saying it adds legitimacy to it.  The more institutions that recognize Bitcoin and invest in it, the harder it becomes for governments to influence it.

Can't answer for OP, but using miners to heat your home only makes sense in one of the follow scenarios:

2. You normally heat your home with other electric based heat

There is more to it than that.  People are also buying up coins now before the fork in hopes to cash in on token doubling.  
What happens after the fork is pretty unknown though.  BTC could tank from people switching to altcoins which have all been in limbo as the fork has been approaching.  It could also tank if enough hash rate is not maintained and causes market uncertainty.  It could also skyrocket due to the people on the sidelines that were unwilling to take the risk of the approaching fork now buying in.

Yes the market share argument is a giant grasping at straws.  Bitcoin started at 100% market share.  It cannot move up from that, only down.  Of course there is going to be competition that will take market share.
Besides, as it is at the moment almost all cryptos are being used mostly as store of value or day trading.  There is *some* commerce happening with cryptos as well.  I bet if you took a look at market share for commerce happening crypto it would be BTC 95%, Litecoin 2%, Ehtereum 2%, everything else (including BCH) 1%.

I will also agree that some things in BCH are better right now like fees and confirmation times.

Who would be doing the attack?  Miners or those colluding with miners.  Who collects tx fees?  Miners again.
Miners doing this is not very expensive when you consider they claim their own fee.  Yes, not all of it because there are many miners...

Why would you give somebody more money for something when they currently owe you?
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:22:40
Your argument is based on a false premise.  You say everybody upgraded to 100gbit but that is not the case.  This analogy is saying BTC is running at 10gbit while 2x is 100gbit ( 20gbit if that were a thing).
You are also talking about if throughput has fixed the problem as users has increased which is adding extra variables.  
A scaling solution is not meant to fix every problem.  Take something like a basic web server for example.  Say it can serve 100 request/s .  If demand exceeds this, it's common to add a second server and put a load balancer infront of them.  You can now serve 200 request/s.  That is called horizontal scaling, which is basically the same as what b2x does. It's also fair to say the throughput has increased to 200 request/s.
Again,I'm not for b2x, but trying to say it's not a scaling option is stupid.  It's a scaling solution to a problem that does not currently exist.

That's not how mining works.  Miners find blocks which include new transaction confirmations and that is it.  Additional confirmations are just new blocks that reference the previous  one.
It's nodes that validate that the blocks are actually valid and this is done in the Bitcoin Core software, not in mining software.

Isn't it funny how alot ISPs are selling you these super fast connections but at the same time limit your usage to archaic numbers?  Most ISPs that have limits its under 500GB/mo
The data-rate needed to transfer 500GB in a 30 day window is 1.58Mbit/s
So you get sold a connection a connection that is rated for a speed of 100+ Mbit/s and then basically get told "don't use it".

There is a big difference in this comparison.
Printing physical bank notes is not the same creating money.  A banknote is nothing more than a representation of money and is replaceable.  Bank notes come into circulation, but they also get destroyed and go out of circulation.  The same is not true of BTC, with BTC, once the coins have been created, they are in circulation forever, even if the private keys required to use them get lost.  
Now then, knowing that difference - 


In other words, assuming your $20mil USD figure is correct, &gt;$18mil of that is simply to replace old or damaged notes and NOT and increase of $20mil in circulation.

The transaction fees are not wasted if you consider there is a also a pretty decent chance that this is done by a miner, or group of miners, that wish to raise the cost of transactions.  They could be colluding to artificially raise transaction fees for normal users.  All they have to is set some funds aside, spam the network with high tx fee transactions using those funds.  If you had the top 4 pools doing this, they would recoup 50% of their costs, so as long as they get the other 50% back from other users that now had to pay higher than normal fees then they can consider their attack profitable.

The problem is really about BTC losing too much hash power in a short period of time.  If BTC loses 75% of its hash power it could take upwards of 2 months for the difficulty to readjust.  At that point it could be feasible for a very large or a couple of large segwit2x miners to 51% the BTC chain.  If that happened... They could basically destroy the BTC chain.  They will do great harm to crypto economies in general though by proving that this kind of thing happening is not just theoretical.

difficulty adjustment happens every 2016 blocks.  This works out to exactly 2 weeks if a block is found every 10 minutes, which is what the target is.
If 50% of hash rate is lost immediatly after a difficulty adjustment occurs, it could take 4 weeks for the difficulty to adjust and during those 4 weeks confirmation times would roughly double and transaction throughput would be roughly half over the same period of time.

History does also show that hash power is also increasing, which has a cost associated with it.  Exactly what the cost would be is pretty complex to determine.  There are alot of factors.  R&amp;D on new mining equipment, manufacture of the equipment, and operating costs of that equipment.
Your statement of saying that price only needs to double when a halving occurs for mining profitability to remain the same would only be true if mining operations never changed and no new miners ever came onboard.

If it's too difficult to acquire and it becomes expensive then why would anybody want it?
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:10:35
Anybody that wants to see the BTC legacy chain fail with the hard fork is smart enough to ensure a maximum amount of hash power is on BTC prior to the split.  They will want the difficulty to be as high as possible.  Then all that hash power leaves the legacy side and mines on 2x.  That leaves the legacy side unable to confirm transactions to the greatest amount possible.  
If BTC starts taking too long to confirm transactions it's going be harmful to BTC with that in its own.  
The best thing people can do to help the legacy side is turn off any miners they have before the difficulty anjustments happen before the split. This will help the difficult at time of split be as low as possible.  Then once the split occurs they fire them back up.  Anybody with legacy / ineffecient hardware can help by firing it up after the split  as well.

All it requires is that a single person, or  bot, replays / rebroadcast the transaction.  They don't have to keep it in mempool, they could store it to disk and rebroadcast at a later point in time.  
Also keep in mind that the 2 week limit  and the default mempool size which I believe is 300mb are Bitcoin Core defaults.  There are other pieces of Bitcoin protocol software out there, I don't know what their limits, if any, are or what their default behavior is.

If this is a miner or group of miners that are spamming the network to raise transaction fees for all users... then you could easily consider the 10-20 bitcoins they spent on the attack to just be an investment too.  After all, they are the ones that directly benefit from raised tx fees.

So you are saying that the shutdown announcements made on official sources for [ViaBTC]( and [BTCC]( are ~~fake~~ lies?

If I were then I'd wait until after... The only way I can see them doing it is to halt trading the day before and wait and see what happens.  Anything else seems too risky.  At the same time this seems very risky to their new business and difficult to explain why it's happen to those not familiar with BTC.

Just because a group of people have ignored the software author's warnings to not use it on mainnet because it's not ready doesn't mean their warnings are not wise.

I wrote this the last time somebody posted one of these:
I'd just like to point out that people should take note of the time span here. There is a common misconception that Bitcoin transactions expire from mempool after a period of time. This is only a semi truth. 
Nodes running Bitcoin Core will by default keep a tx in mempool for 2 weeks from the time it recieved it. That does not mean it's 2 weeks from the time it was created, signed, or broadcast.
A transaction in Bitcoin is timeless. It is valid forever as long as the inputs are unspent. A transaction can live on the network forever by any node rebroadcasting your tx over and over and over. You could send a tx and not have it confirm for 1000 years as long as the inputs remain unspent.
If you send a tx that does not confirm and you change your mind about it... When your wallet allows you to, respend at least one of the inputs, even if it means spending to yourself. Once that new tx confirms, the original becomes invalid.

In fairness, he has had nothing to do with the company since like 2010 when Intel bought the company.  Even he is not pleased with the current state of the software.

Bitmain has been known to use TSMC for its chip fabrication.
There was a press release from a company called Ebang in Nov/Dec that claimed to be working with Samsung to fab a chip for them... 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:14:25
Not quite.
These are not Samsung's chips.  They are fabricated by Samsung, but Samsung does not own the design or the rights to sell them on the open market.  Its the same as say how Foxconn manufacturers the iPhone for Apple, does not mean that Foxconn can then turn around and start selling the phone to anybody else that wants to slap their logo on it.
There was a press release a bit over a month ago from a company called Ebang that claimed to be preparing to release a miner and that Samsung was fabricating the chips for them.  However, in that press release I believe they claimed it was going to be 10nm chips, the press release from Samsung claims the chip is 12 or 14nm though I believe.  The press release from Ebang was originally in a Chinese language though and the Samsung one was in Korean... so something could have been lost in translation.
Its by no means whatever company just slapping a metal casing on something... what Samsung has done here is just fabricated the chip according to somebody else's design and all the R&amp;D effort they had to put into it.  There is additional work of still needing to design the software to interface with the chips, pcb designs, etc.

I completely agree it would be self detrimental.. but people sometimes do very irrational things over controversy.

In your scenario Bitcoin has become expensive in China, meaning you will lose alot of value by taking Bitcoin that was bought in China  and exchanging it outside of China.  There would likely be better (cheaper) ways of doing this.

No they don't.  Why would a developer write a single line of code for a feature that nobody wants?  You only write code or there is enough support to warrant a test and showcase of it.

If you mess it up really bad it will become unreadable, however just a few random blocks is likely to unaffect it.  QR codes actually contain redundant bits used for error correcting when reading them.

That in essence is investing.  They purchase goods with fiat and sell it for crypto.  They have in essence bought crypto, they just had an intermediate step.

Now I am certainly no fisheries expert, however, considering this is a picture of the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric  Powerplant, which is located along the Niagara River on the Canadian side of the River... i'm going to go ahead and say its pretty unlikely that salmon have ever been climbing that river.  Niagara Falls would be quite the jump for them.
There are however other waterways that connect these 2 lakes just FYI.

You cant because if the block being solved contains the payout address for thr block reward.  That address will be the pool's address.  If you modify the address then you modify the hash of the block. Which means you are basically solo mining.
