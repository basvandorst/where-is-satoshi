The network is new because the consensus rules are different. One node will reject blocks that the other accepts. If not, then there wouldn't even be a fork.

I don't accept your premise. Anyone is free to create an alt, but then to claim that bitcoin needs to be redefined doesn't follow from that. There is no decision necessary and the entire ecosystem operates in accordance with that.

Would you like to discuss non-contentious forks? BCash is clearly not one, but we could if you like, though I'm not sure to what purpose. 
To create a fork, you literally 'clone' the software repository and make your changes. You then push that software out to people interested in running it and launch your coin. You have clearly created a new network. Now you assert that bitcoin needs definition based on your new coin. It does not.

Thanks, that's great info. I've thought about running electrum-x as well, along with a lightning hub. I have a free linux box at home, but will be moving in 6 months or so and may not have as good connectivity then, so having a stable hosted solution would be nice. Last I checked co-hosting was even more pricey, but that was years and years ago, maybe I'll check into that. Thanks!

If you hadn't sold the BTC yet, and aiming for tax avoidance, not evasion, would moving to another country before selling mean that the capital gains would be calculated in the new country? 
If not, would it be split somehow? Say you purchased some BTC in 2014 while living in the US. In 2017 you move to Panama and sell them. Do you owe capital gains in the US?

Yes, the exchange still exists: 
This was actually how I first learned of Bitcoin. Unfortunately Linden shut down sale of Linden Dollars for Bitcoin within maybe 6 months, iirc. I’d been making around $600/year from SL from around 2009-20011 and had tried to setup an account at VirWox, but by the time I got it ready they disabled Bitcoin. You had to create an account on the website, then go link it from in world. 
Some time later, fall of 2013, I came across Bitcoin again and went with Coinbase and then got swept up by the tech and it’s been quite a ride! But, well, that’s my ‘what if’ story. Tbh, it would be really trippy to have millions of dollars of Bitcoin from selling virtual goods in Second Life.

But comparing coins to companies is a poor analogy. Bitcoin is closer to a protocol, more like tcp/ip than a website. To imagine another coin unseating it is to imagine the whole of the network effect to date being usurped. Possible, but unless Bitcoin fails, pretty unlikely.

Ugh, I just opened a Kraken account yesterday and started the verification process. I need somewhere with the equivalent of their T4 verification level and that does at least ETH and BTC. Probably OTC trading would be good, but I'm a little of a noob with such things. 
Poloniex has too low of a daily/monthly withdrawal limit (25K max from what I can find) - I already have a backlog to clear off of there. 
itBit looks good, but seems to be Bitcoin only.
Gemini looks like it might do the trick - anyone have experience with them? 
GDAX seems fairly popular. Coinbase closed my account a couple years ago -- I'm guessing I may not be able to open one on GDAX - anyone with experience like that?
Bitstamp - I thought was EU only, no?

Very possibly, I don't really know the requirements of the system well enough to know, but I can posit a couple of use cases where Bitcoin could help. There seemed to be 2 issues with the current system:
* 1. Forged documents were added to the database
* 2. Documents intended to be private were accessed
Here is some speculation based on possible use cases....
1 There are already solutions for tracking authenticity of digital assets using blockchain tech. Combined with access control based on a blockchain-based identity system you could at least make this very difficult. And in any case, there would be a clear audit trail of when the document was added or updated and by whom. 
2 Assumption: the documents are intended to be public, but at a later date. In this case, they can be added to a distributed storage system and encrypted such that *nobody* could read them. A timelock is added that could trigger a state change to be decrypted and published.
2.1 Assumption: a limited number of people need access to the document. In this case you could create a n-of-m key such that access was limited to the various key holders and it might require 2 (or more) key holders to access any document. Social engineering may still thwart this, but it should prove somewhat more difficult. 
All that said, those scenarios may be wildly off how the current system is used. My point is only that there very possibly could be ways that Bitcoin (and Rootstock possibly, or other sidechain tech) could make this type of breach more difficult. 
(edit: formatting)

Bitcoin benefits from network effect - the more people use it the more useful it is. The more useful it is, the more people use it. This is why its growth will be exponential. To be fair, if it fails to grow exponentially, it will go to $0 -- it won't sulk around for long if it isn't being adopted. The next decade will be the pricing for this new currency/asset/technology and if it doesn't completely fail then the price will increase exponentially. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:59:03
Yes, I do not live under a rock, I realize there are many blockchains. The reason I used 'quotes' around 'blockchain' is because I was quoting the OP. 
I am somewhat familiar with Ethereum, having invested in the crowdsale. Ethereum is great, but I'm much less interested in all the projects to create private, corporate versions. While they may solve some problems pretty well, they will never be disruptive, or, as the quote says, create any sort of new model.

Your feeling is very possibly false. If your computer is compromised with a key logger, you could lose your Bitcoin. Someone posted a thread here who had that happen just the other day, and there are other attacks as well, this is just one example. Also, if there is any way to connect your online presence eventually back to you, attackers could specifically target you. This would be more likely for either known whales or people who sometimes come on here and note how much they have, but worth keeping in mind. (I created this alt account one day when a little paranoid about this.)
Even if you're very safe, you'd want to weigh the risk to the cost. If you have only small Bitcoin to try it out, it isn't a big risk. But imagine if you either purchase more or the holdings you have accrue enough value that you're sitting on thousands, tens of thousands or more in value. All of a sudden you may feel somewhat less safe. One saying in Bitcoin is 'be your own bank', which is liberating, but also concerning. 
For a little under a hundred bucks, a hardware wallet will bring a lot of peace of mind.

The US is one of only 2 countries that taxes based on citizenship. It doesn't matter where the money is earned, they want a cut. You'd need to renounce your US citizenship and even then, you'd need to wait to realize your BTC gains until after renouncing as they will levy any taxes they feel are due when you renounce.
Also, you'd want to weigh the cost of 2nd citizenship against the possible upside of the same $$ amount left in BTC over the next year or two. If you believe BTC will go up considerably, the $240k might be worth a lot more even after a 15% tax. 
(Not that this has been on my mind...:) )
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:36:34
Andreas can explain it better than me, but here's my take. First, I don't think there's an important distinction between miner vs non-miner node. A (verifying) node is a node, but one node may be running different software than another. If you have version 'A' and 'B' and a miner is running 'B', they will only get transactions from nodes that believe B is truth. If 90% of nodes are A nodes, the B network may be quite small and will be isolated (forked) from A. The miner can decide to run B, but whether that work will propagate to the network is dependent on the nodes. Thus the nodes are deciding the rules, not the miners. 
Now if 90% of miners decide to run B, but only 10% of nodes are running B, B will still be a small ecosystem. 
If 10% of miners are running A, but 90% of nodes are running A, A will be a large ecosystem. 
There are challenges with this outcome (blocks will be very slow until difficulty can adjust down; system may be vulnerable to 51% attacks), but just to illustrate that what software nodes are running is what determines the rules, not the miners.
Given the two (simplistic) scenarios, the larger ecosystem will have more value and will therefor be more profitable to mine. Miners may artificially support the smaller ecosystem, but it will cost them money. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:18:47
I've been trying to decide if I should use one or more hardware wallets for my holdings. I imagine it like if you were a pirate and had a big pile of gold coins. To secure them, you to bury them in a chest and draw a map so you could find it again. Assuming the hiding spot was completely secure without the map, would you split the coins into several chests and bury them in different places with different maps? Or keep them together with just one map? 
Splitting them up gives you some security in case one map is lost, but it also means you'll need to have several maps that you need to secure. To do this properly, you'd need several vaults, probably in different geographic locations. 
I currently have 3 Trezors with holdings spread across them, but kind of considering moving them onto one and using the passphrase feature (described below by lollibtards) to further hide them on that device and just never storing the passphrase with the seed (which will go in a safe deposit box). 
So, one chest or many? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:41:17
Ugh, good luck man. One of my biggest fears is outsmarting myself with my security. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:59:43


Exactly. And when people compare Bitcoin to the dotcom bubble, they're imagining that Bitcoin is a .com, but it's not, it's tcp/ip. If you'd invested in tcp/ip and hodl'd through the early 2000s, you'd be very pleased with your holdings. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:23:59


A blockchain without a means of incentivizing security is not trustless. Further, in a private blockchain you will have central points of failure in the form of the private keys of the participants. Not to say there may not be use cases for private blockchains, but they certainly fail to be something much more interesting than what could be developed using existing development techniques.
Now if they were to build a system on a public blockchain, RSK on Bitcoin or using the actual Ethereum blockchain, that would be something new.

Any bitcoin you own before the fork will have an equal amount of BTC1 coin after the fork. With prior forks it was better (and probably still is) to have your holdings on a hardware wallet or at least where you have control of the private keys. This was because if you left your holdings on an exchange you were at their mercy to get at your new coins. If this goes as Charlie is saying (which I would be inclined to believe) then Coinbase will support the new coins from day 1 and you should be able to sell them if you wish. 
With a hardware wallet, the wallet software you interact with (e.g. Trezor web wallet, etc.) will need to be upgraded to support the new coin. When it is, you can access it approximately like your regular BTC and send it to an exchange to sell. (Or you can do nothing and hold both currencies.) There will probably be more complete guides to dealing with this fork since it is technically a little different from previous ones.

@_date: 2017-10-22 17:25:48
Another great feature of using one (or more) passphrases is plausible deniability. You can store a small amount of Bitcoin just on the basic seed level and put the rest of your holdings on the passphrase. Then if someone (or some govt agency) forces you to unlock the wallet, you can show the small amount and they would have no way to know that there was anything else there. 
You could even make 3 wallets with a tiny amount on the seed, a small amount on one passphrase and the rest of your holdings on another. Then you could give up the passphrase for the small amount under duress and still possibly hold the rest. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:08:42
I think this is one of Andreas's most important talks, certainly given the current state of affairs. As usual, he takes the high ground and stays out of the mudslinging and reminds us of what Bitcoin is all about and how that relates to various approaches to scaling. It really helps to shed some of the negativity and cynicism and remember what we might be able to create if we don't give in to liberty stealing shortcuts.

As an old person, can confirm it was a little abrasive. I'm 56, but was on the internet in the early 90s and developing websites a few years later. This is actually how I quickly saw what Bitcoin could be -- in 2013 it felt just like 1993 of the web and this time I could invest and both help the technology develop as well as make a few bucks. 
But to be fair, I did really enjoy the rest of the video and enjoyed all the historical references. It's interesting that we are really repeating history as we knock down the latest round of magnates. We can already see JD is losing his grip as Wall Street circles Bitcoin and doesn't give two shits about what he says. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:43:59
If you're in the USA, Coinbase is certainly an easy and efficient way. It is also safe, but after you make the purchase, you should move the coins to a wallet where you have control of the private keys. If you're purchasing more than a small amount, consider getting a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano. They cost just under a hundred bucks, but give you the best security/effort around. 
BitGo and GreenAddress are two web wallets that allow you to control you keys, but they are not as simple to use as a hardware wallet.

In theory it would be, but in practice you need to buy and sell at the right time or you will come out behind. The common fail is selling where you think a top is, but the market doesn't reverse and you need to buy back in at a higher price. Technical analysis is only so useful to an asset class that is unlike anything and people get themselves in trouble all the time with charts full of meaningless lines. 
I would only do that with a small subset of my holdings and only if I was an experienced trader. I'm not, so I bought and held and am very happy I did. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:19:21

@_date: 2017-10-25 17:02:24
I think it's because in their clarification they state that they'll wait a minimum of 48 hours to make the call on which is which. Though it does say 'minimum', 48 hours is a very short time to wait. Miners could easily mine a less profitable fork for that long, where if the term was 2 weeks or a month, they would more likely follow the money. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:09:31
By defining what Bitcoin is for myself, I join with other nodes that have made the same decision. Collectively we are defining Bitcoin and if a miner produces blocks that we reject, they will not be propagated nor rewarded. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:42:16
I think you're making my point? It would take more than 48 hours to determine what the market thinks. The slower chain won't go to zero, it will just be slower. If in fact users could not make a single transaction, the value of coins *couldn't* change. Meanwhile, the faster chain could go to a low unit value if it experiences a lot of sells. If this was the case, miners would be more profitable moving to the slower chain. This is highly likely to happen and the main question is how long until it stabilizes and we can see what the market thinks.

This may actually be less secure. If someone (for example, the IRS, who can seize safe deposit boxes) gets your seed they would have access to your holdings. If you have a Ledger or Trezor and utilize the passphrase described above, someone getting your seed would not have access to your holdings. 
That said, there are ways to password protect a paper wallet (as I recall). I personally get nervous going down that road as I've seen so many reddit posts over the years of people losing access to their private keys from basically outsmarting themselves with complex security plans.

I did a little mining in 2014 (couple of Ant S3s) and tried to go in bigger (4 Black Arrow somethingorothers), but after months and months of delays I was very, very lucky to get a refund on my purchase. (Not sure if miner pre-orders are still a thing, but if so, just walk away.) I directly purchased bitcoin and am very glad I did. 
I haven't looked at mining since then, but useful lifespans of miners used to be something closer to 6 months than 2-3 years. When it costs more in electricity than you make, you would be better off directly purchasing.

It's unlikely anyone here would tell you anything other than get into it. The only difference will be the scale, from 'sell your house, wife, kids and 401k' to 'no more than you can afford to lose'. 
You really just have to do some research and see what you think. You generally can't ask most investment advisors as they don't know much yet and people who do know are generally already pretty biased towards it.

6:33 **"Nodes decide what the rules are, not miners.** Miners get the transactions that *nodes* decided were valid. And they give back blocks, *at the pleasure of the nodes,* that will decide if they are worthy of being propagated because they are valid. The validity of the consensus rules is *not* determined by miners. They sequence transactions into a block. **The validity of the consensus rules is determined by nodes, because they will not propagate lies."**
