Could you expand, I don't get what this means:

I'm not sure I get what you mean.
Basically, when a fork happens, during the first few hours the kernels (of a given UTXO) on both chains are the same because every single parameter of the kernels are **seeded on the main chain**. 
So this completely prevents miners from mining on multiple chain - at least during the first hours following a fork (which is more than sufficient).


Could you please develop?
I'm not sure I get what you mean by "prevents broadcasting one block if this should be the case". I guess it boils down to: it's always the case. The only "alternate client" people could use would be one that doesn't have this duplicate stake detection mechanism. However, as long as a majority of the network runs the default client, all users mining on multiple chains will in average incur a loss.


My bad, I misread :)

To be clear, the duplicate block detection is used to prevent miners from mining on multiple chain when a network fork naturally occurs (this mechanism is not designed to prevent users from creating long range forks, there are other mechanisms to prevent such attackers from succeeding).
What the duplicate stake mechanism is looking for is blocks that were created using the same proof-of-stake.
A miner mining on both branches will be mining with the same UTXOs and (in the short term, say ~6h) these UTXOs will share the same kernel even though the blocks they try to create are on different chains and thus the **proofs will be the same on both branches**.
This stems from the fact that unlike Bitcoin's block header, the kernel in PoS does not contain any information about the previous block or the transaction contained in the block.
Therefore, blocks on competing chains will always detect and punish miners mining on multiple branches when a fork occurs.
The detection mechanism is implemented in the default client and users have no incentive to deactivate it.


How does it introduce complexity? It simply punishes miners trying to mine on both chains.

How is a functioning solution not a solution to the theoretical problem?

I agree with you, that's not what I meant. Maybe my answer wasn't very clear.
What I meant was that you cannot create a fork with a limited number of coins and hope for it to be "longer" than the main chain. Grinding will give you an edge but a very limited one. In NeuCoin, a simili 51% attack could be conducted with ~30% of the mining coins.
I'd love to go into details and to have your feedback on this.


Although NeuCoin doesn't use such a mechanism, I think it's an interesting subject.
I've actually been wondering how important do you think it is that a consensus mechanism allows "full bootstrapping" of nodes and why?
By "full bootstrapping" I mean a node only needs the genesis block and all generated blocks to figure out which chain is the main one.
In my opinion, this depends on the rule that rejects reorgs.
Imagine it rejects reorgs that are deeper than 10mn. Than I agree that the consensus we get is relatively weak because any node going offline for more than that would need to update through a trusted source.
Now imagine it rejects forks that started more than a month ago or six months ago. In this case, the only time when nodes would need a trusted source would be for the initial bootstrapping. 
I personally don't believe this compromises decentralization since it wouldn't confer any real power to the trusted source.

The parameters of the kernel don't depend on the previous block (you can check page 14 of white paper for details on the structure of the kernel). The parameter of the kernel that changes over time (in addition to the current timestamp) is the stake modifier. The stake modifier changes every 200 minutes and for the stake modifier to be different in the different branches, it has to inherit at least one bit for a block natif to the forks. The probability for this to happen is extremely low (I could compute it precisely if you're interested).


What do you mean by "get future stakes rejected"?
@_date: 2015-04-19 16:07:17
As rational as your comment might be, the very reaction you got shows how difficult it would be for Bitcoin to change its consensus mechanism.
@_date: 2015-04-01 12:43:44
This is false.
Grinding on the main chain is theoretically impossible. The reason is simply that the *stake modifier* which is used in the kernel (equivalent of the block header in PoS) doesn't exist a the time the user receives the UTXO that will be used to stake.
In order to grind, the attacker must have complete control over the block space, i.e. he must be working alone on a fork. In this case, more computing power has an extremely limited effect on the efficiency of the attack. Take a look at *Figure 8* on the page 36 of the white paper.
High-level unsubstantiated arguments like "It's impossible to stop stake grinding except by making it computationally difficult" don't help the debate advance (provided this is what you're trying to do).
If you have a detailed modus operandi for this kind of attack, we'd be glad to hear it.

While I agree that Peercoin-style checkpointing creates a very high centralization, I don't believe that a central entity (a foundation for example) providing a the currently accepted version of the block chain represents any where near this kind of centralization.
With Peercoin's checkpointing the person who owns the private key used to create checkpoints effectively decides which history is the right one. In the "trusted entity" scenario on the other hand, the entity has no real power. It only provides new nodes with a snapshot of the most recent state of the consensus. It never "decides" which branch is the right one.
This is taken care of by the miners, IMO this is decentralized consensus.
@_date: 2015-04-01 12:46:50
Would you care to expand?
@_date: 2015-04-02 08:53:50
I don't believe that two groups would come to different chains. What would cause the network to fork? Once a new node is bootstrapped (from a trusted source), this mechanism allows it to stay in consensus with the rest of the network provided he doesn't stay offline for more than say a month. Therefore, what would cost the network to split?


I don't think what you're referring to should be called consensus but rather "consensus + trustless bootstrapping".
And I don't see how the quality of the consensus of a "simple consensus network" would be inferior. The only argument I'd imagine against such a system would be an ideological one, of the type: "a trusted source providing the right block chain to new nodes is too much centralization". I personally don't believe it because it doesn't grant any power to the entity but I don't see how the other arguments aren't erroneous.
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:07:35
True. However, the high level discussion about whether proof-of-stake is possible has not been useful to the community. The goal of the paper is to get feedback from bitcoin people (like yourself :) ) on PoS security (most of the objections against Peercoin have been fixed) in an honest way.
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:17:52
There are no "handful of people". Coins belong to foundations that have no economic incentive to do anything else than distribute them.
What is often disregarded is that the economic incentive of the founders is precisely to distribute the coin as much as possible - so that the minority of the coins (owned by founders and investors) grow in value. Centralization-wise these people's holding are orders of magnitude smaller than that of Bitcoin whales

Thanks I appreciate it!
Concerning the references, I agree that they should improved. We will definitely cite BlackCoin and Nubits more clearly in version 1.1 of the paper which we're currently working on and should be released soon.
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:13:12
The main purpose of PoS is not distribution. It's first and foremost a consensus mechanism. 
PoS coins can use PoW as a distribution mechanism (and have: Peercoin, Blackcoin etc). The reason we didn't do it is we believe PoS allows to design a smarter distribution mechanism

But what will happen [after the pools](
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:26:52
How would a hacker realistically steal 50% of the (mining) coins to conduct an attack ? Keep in mind that a coin holder whose mining key gets stolen can send his coins and get a new one.
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:28:38
Network effects cannot be replicated.
@_date: 2015-03-24 12:04:47
The fact that sending a transaction bears an opportunity cost doesn't mean that people will stop spending their coins.
PoS currencies must balance the incentive to spend coins and the incentive to stake them. The equilibrium depends on a number of parameters: the type of the block reward, the liquidity cost (which is a function of the period during which the coins have to be able to be eligible to mine) etc.
Interestingly enough, in Peercoin, the percentage of coins staking is actually low. This comes from the fact that Peercoin's interest rate is low (1% annually) and the liquidity cost is high (the so called "minimum stake age" is 30 days).
Therefore, empirically, PoS coins seem to actually suffer from the opposite problem.
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:37:20
The goal of the paper is to get some feedback on the feasibility of the attacks. We believe that for PoS to make some progress there has to be an open discussion about its security. If you think we haven't covered some attacks or missed something feel free to point it out. 
We forked Peercoin, we also used innovation introduced by BlackCoin and we acknowledge it. We also believe that distribution is a crucial part of PoS security. The repo will be made public before the launch.
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:21:36
I agree that the current mining mechanism with one single private key to mine and to spend the coins is flawed and will have to evolve. It's not an intrinsic issue though, there are solutions:

PoW is in intrinsically inefficient. No matter how large the market is, the level of security will not be able to scale up.
Today, Bitcoin's 10% inflation rate is paying for security. Let's get crazy for a moment and imagine Bitcoin's market cap grows to 10 trillion dollars, with ~0% inflation do you expect that total transaction fees will be $100billion dollars a year? Of course not! Therefore, you need to choose, very high transaction fees or very low security (compared to the market cap)


Do [these]( look like mining pools to you?


This argument is nonsensical. Do you think the equivalents of Coinbase, Blockchain, Circle or Xapo would collude to destroy their own businesses? Those entities' incentives would be much better aligned with that of the coin holders than Bitcoin's mining pools.
@_date: 2015-03-31 10:08:46
This is untrue. A miner cannot mint on multiple chains. The reasons why are detailed in the white paper (p24)

My [link]( keeps getting downvoted :) but it's an interesting read!!
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:11:35
Yes wallets will be processing a significant part of the transactions, the same way pools have been processing transactions (and big mining companies [will]( . The difference is: 1/ Wallets have a much smaller incentive to collude than PoW miners since coin holders are their clients. No "bank" would conduct an attack that would destroy the value of its assets. 2/ Barrier to entry is very low. If a wallet provides a bad quality of service (like miners do!), coin holders can easily vote with their feet.
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:57:57
Interesting point of view


Honest question: How would coin holders "choose new miners" if a large, privately held mining company misbehaved?


Why would we want a separation of power between coin holders and transaction processors?


1/ How is buying coins on an exchange not "permissionless entry"
2/ In practice, most miners sell their coins to pay for their expenses. Therefore, what we're actually getting is an intermediary that mines the coins before selling them to people desiring to acquire bitcoins. No new bitcoin user is going to think, "I'd like to get a few bitcoin, I should start mining" 
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:34:30


fair enough :)
What we want is to spark a discussion about PoS.
If PoS can be made secure, it's difficult to argue that it doesn't constitute a better consensus mechanism than PoW (the cost of an attack scales with the market cap, it's cost-efficient...).
The goal of the paper is precisely to get more people to understand the rational behind proof-of-stake and discuss its security.
