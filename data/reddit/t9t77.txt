Amir got this ass backwards.  Gavin has been involved the longest AND he lives in a humble home and doesn't make that much money.  Meanwhile, Greg Maxwell has been paid 100s of millions of dollars from banking and insurance interests.  Wait...I know.  I know.  It's his company Blockstream that has done that.  
Also, real simple to figure out.  What would happen if the other side won, Maxwell and company have already said they'll stop coding.  So there you have it.  If they don't get their way, they could care less about bitcoin.

A benevolent dictator would be FAR better than what we have now.  Now we have evil dictators that have stalled bitcoin's growth for years and are perfectly content to see it go under.  
Gavin did the right thing by trying to introduce competing software.  Nothing else you really can do against the Gregomaniacs when they have so much money from bankers and insurance companies backing them.

Yeah...that sounds exactly like you guys.  I love the posts over and over claiming everyone is a sockpuppet of Roger Ver with the rolling eyes gif.  
If you're new and don't know this sub engages in MASSIVE control efforts then go over to rbtc and see what the fuss is about.

Gavin makes a decent living.  Maxwell is living lavishly.   Do bankers just not pay as much for their puppets any more?  Lol.  
Maxwell is the bankers puppet.
