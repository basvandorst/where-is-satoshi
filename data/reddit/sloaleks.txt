well, most of us are still learning dealing with this much volatility. but even if not all of us know much about the mechanics of these swings, there are patterns. we already had a couple of "bubble" pops, and most od us are still here. so, really, don't panic.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:05:37
Oh, really? Money infact does bring happiness. There's even a threshold when it stops working (at bout 1.5 M euros in Europe).
The reason for apparently less depression in 3rd world countries is, they don't bother counting in, because people are sick and die all over the place because malnutrition, lack of clean drinking water, lack of toilets, general hygiene and for the lack of an affordable health/medicine grid.

I don't really hate working, I hate my job. I don't think what you are saying by describing yourself as weak willed is the fact of the matter. Maybe it's a matter of self esteem, which would in fact grow if you were able to make more wealth by not having to work for that, but instead having the investment work for you ...  and leaving you free to do "work" that more fulfils you.

I don't think so, I am all done with shitty cars. Or rather, I would like to be done, but as I am poor, I am still trembling each year at inspection ... If you can literally buy any car you want, your post is missing the OPs brothers anguish. Because you have already made it, you must be rich enough. I am almost 50 and have had nothing from life. When I was young, I had no work and no money, so went nowhere. Now I have work and still no money. Just work and shitty cars and shitty homes. Some money literally would make me happy. Not 6.000 BTC, it would take much less, but I understand OPs brother. I don't know what I would have done in a similar case, maybe not suicide, but I would get sick as a dog.

coke and yachts, at least you would have noble habits.

Don't forget, that a good chunk of heath must be bought. The more money you have, the healthier you are. I suspect you actually did not have enough to pay for better treatment.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:19:23
Keeping money can be learned tho. You just need to want to learn it, but that's another can of worms.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:43:54
Yeah, but still ... 6.000 BTC he had were not hypothetical ... loosing it to MtGox or something similar was a heavy blow.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:26:21
Well, to really not care, it will take more than one and a little bit less than two million, including care of a large family in a 1st world country. Some countries may really be cheaper, IDK ... Asia maybe, central America, some Pacific island countries ...
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:27:51
I don't think it's even limited to American culture. I suspect China has about the same number of millionaires than America.

You're right. Money will not console you on your last day, but it may buy the best drugs ... then maybe consolation will not be a priority anymore, as you're gonna be comfortable enough. Or maybe even asleep. When you're gone, you're gone. Doesn't matter what the circumstances of your life were, peace or not. Dead people don't worry.
So even in death money matters, if you can pay to make it comfortable, vs. just letting you suffer because you don't have the means, untill finally you die. All things considered, I'd much rather be rich than poor, even on my last day.
I'm working on it, but there's a very small chance of success. So I still might end up meditating all the same ...
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:16:58
I don't. Money matters a lot. In fact, money does bring happiness, up to a level. This has been measured. In Europe having more than about 1.5 million euros is the threshold where money does not matter anymore. No amount of meditation can bring the calming effect financial independence has.

get over it. if there's no shiba available for adoption, pick another dog. shibas, worldwide, (in the us too), are a popular puppy mill breed. when shelters in your area are cleared of adoption dogs, and there's absolutely no dog in need of a home, you can go and search for a bred puppy to buy, if you still feel to care for a dog.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:43:43
it's a point of view, not saying yours is bad. but it's not the smart way to go. the way to go to better wealth is not by work. it's by investment. make your money work for you, you did your share earning it. there really isn't anything wrong with being rich (or, maybe not really reach, lets say financially independent) no matter how you got there, even if it's by inheritance. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:05:53
After 75K money brings static happiness, in lets say, 1st world countries. They are in fact not happier getting richer, just full happy. Money never stops to bring happiness untill a relatively large sum. In Europe it starts being of no matter in life after about 1.5M€.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:38:06
yeah. about that. failed terribly at that.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:26:04
Yeah ... but you wouldn't have to choose, your life would still be your life, only half a billion higher. A man with that kind of money does not have to choose, he can have it all.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:22:45
Eheheh, too late ... but our kids, I am almost sure of that, will really not have kids of their own. I mean, I'm not 100%, but very close. they needed in average 4 more years hunting for their first job than we did. And they are paid worse than we were, and we in turn were paid much less our parents did. My wife's parents, for instance, were a cleaning lady and an ironmonger, and they built a really nice home. Today with the salaries of these two professions it would not be possible
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:21:13
Everyone keeps saying that, but it's actually not true at all. Rich people in fact lead fuller and healthier lives.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:22:51
Having had this amount of BTC, selling it off way too early, would make me sick too. I get it. I know it doesn't help, but I understand. There's not many shots we can get at financial independence.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:59:56
About that, yeah. Rich people actually do live fuller lives and are generally healthier and live longer. I'll gladly take that "having money stress", thankyouverymuch .... anyday in fact. If you're poor, chances are you have "explored" the local park several hundred times. Aaaand it got old years ago, about the third time you went ...
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:11:46
I think this is crap. I'm turning 50. I don't why on earth I would have more kids. Kids suck you dry of money. If you have kids you can forget on nice things in life. Well, not it you are rich, then you can have a quality life with a bunch of kids. If not, every kid is a struggle financially. Even my brother and I were for our parents, and they made more (way more) money than me and my wife make today.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:43:09
utterly useless comparison for now. to send 20 dollar's worth BTC from my wallet would result in 20 USD fee.
just beacuse I had some microtransactions sent to my wallet. now I cant get mym money out of it, lest I pay an insane fee.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:41:32
I have an Exodus wallet. There is no way to set a fee in Exodus. Please advise how to get money out of Exodus wallet on small fee.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:38:18
That is exodus wallet for you. Would strongly advise against using now that I know. There is no way you can set a fee, so Exodus automatically chooses the highest for you, in order to really get a transaction verified (quickly).
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:33:21
I find that hard to believe. Fees are insane. I tried to send 40 USD worth of BTC from my wallet last week to an account and my fees were more than 19 USD worth of BTC, just because I received 4 or 5 small payments a week ago.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:39:56
how did you achieve this? Is there any way to get my money out of my exodus wallet that cheap?
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:58:35
thanks man, will try.
@_date: 2018-06-22 10:48:30
None in the EU and AFAIK, not even in broader Europe. You can legally buy a very low level air rifle in Europe (except Switzerland) at the age of 18 ... no firearms just being 18. You need to apply for a firearms possession permit, a lengthy and not cheap process. And still, you might not get approved. But if you do get approved, this only allows you to keep a gun in a safe at home. Good luck fighting a bunch of home invaders with a gun in a safe.
And still, even if you can get enough time to grab the gun, load it, point and shoot ... good luck with the justice system, if you harm or even kill your home invaders. The justice system on our continent does not take it lightly if you actively defend yourself, and it specially doesn't like it if you use firearms. It's hard to prove in court and you might get punished for it. So, passive defence and compliance with the criminals' requests was the best bet for those Austrians.
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:02:32
Good for you. You can always sell when it's cheaper.
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:06:05
I sold all my BTC for doge yesterday  sold all doge back for BTC for a 22% return a few hours later  ... I was tempted to wait 0.00000035, but greed got me in trouble before, so i set my order a little lower ... so, proud owner of 0.2 BTC. Lambo, baby. OK not enough, but a pug?
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:34:05
OK. let's look what you made the past 5 years. since we don't know which ETF/s you play, let's take a conservative, JP Morgan $ EM bond UCITS ETF.
2012 to 2013 you earned nothing. in fact, -7%. 2013 to 2014 you earned 7%, but you in fact earned nothing because of last year. 2014 to 2015 you earned 0.5 %. 2015 to 2016 you earned 9%. 2016 to 2017 you earned 9%. so you gained what, a good 22% in 5 years? 1000$ to 1220$.
Now lets see bitcoin:
2012 to 2013 you earned 100%. 2013 to 2014 you earned 6100%, the best year of bitcoin. 2014 to 2015 you earned nothing, -270%. 2015 to 2016 you earned 40%, still recovering. 2016 to 2017 you earned 110%, 
in total 6080%. 1000$ to about 61000$. and a good year is still to come ... with about 1400%.
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:22:03
It's been doing that since yesterday evening ...
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:56:15
I didn't. sold  bught  600. needed cash desperately to fix car on grounds of nearing MOT and needing my car to get to work. but it was still worth it, got a costly fix for relatively cheap.
