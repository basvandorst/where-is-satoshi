Other people have been doing a pretty good job of describing things, so I'll give you a little tidbit of advice:
Once you set up a local client (and you should do so, for reasons others have gone into), you're going to have to wait a **long** time for the blockchain to download and verify. Deal with it. It's possible to manually download and import it, but it'll still have to verify it, which is what takes most of the time.
In the meantime, use a web wallet. The one at blockchain.info is great for reasons others have described. Once you have the blockchain downloaded and verified, you can do either of the following:
 * **export it from blockchain.info** and then import it in your local client -- this is a bit technical (you'll have to go into the console in bitcoin-qt), and the paranoid might be worried about the fact that, if the folks who run blockchain.info are untrustworthy, they could steal users' private keys and access their wallets. If you export it, you will still be able to access it from blockchain.info, and both clients will reflect all updates to your wallet.
 * **generate a new wallet**, then send yourself the coins from blockchain.info -- this is much less technical, but you'll have to pay a transaction fee if you want to receive them in a timely manner (this is true of any bitcoin transaction). If you want, you can even keep using the blockchain.info wallet if you want to keep some of the coins separate.

You know what else is anonymous, nearly-untraceable, and impossible to charge back? Fiat currency.
Food for thought.
