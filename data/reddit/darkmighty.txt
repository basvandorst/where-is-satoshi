It's both; I don't think it's even useful labeling it this or that. Bitcoin enables a wide variety of economic behaviors that would need some kind of middleman without it. But the concept of removing mm is useless if you don't have a viable *way* of doing it, which is where  Bitcoin and it's innovations come in. If it isn't technically viable the whole concept dies.

You can never guarantee that individuals are rational (or good -- sometimes being rational and doing "the right thing" may be different) all the time, but you can reasonably expect that a large group of selected individuals, through consensus, will reach rational and ethical decisions -- with ethics as defined by the selection rules. The drug addict example is a good illustration to this.
This is essentially law of large numbers from statistics -- average out the behaviors and get something stable.

Also, bitcoin isn't necessary to charge lower fees. Bitcoin may have a total overhead (due to extra computing, networking, exchanges, etc) not much lower than the credit card industry (with it's own perils as chargebacks, consumer protection, frauds, etc); however credit card fees are very high simply because they enjoy a privileged strategic position (i.e. an oligopoly), and there hasn't been a very successful competitor to degrade their ridiculous earnings. Dwolla and Square are two companies notably trying their hand.
The future is not as clear as it looks for cryptocurrencies, but credit card companies' oligopoly indeed begs to be broken, like all delicate spreads in our economy.

Let me also chime in:
Decentralized systems have existed for very long and they're essential for the existence of even the most basic structures of power since Ancient Greece and Rome. The justice system is a good example of this -- it has a controlled hierarchy of judges with varying levels of reliability all the way to the top; voting itself is a decentralization and reliability tool; the balance between congress, white house and military; and so on.
What was *not* accessible, due to basically mathematical intractability (only achievable with computers), was decentralizing things to this degree without trust (all trust goes to the system), and achieving privacy (modern cryptography).
This new tech may lead to pretty much revolutions by offloading trust from several institutions into a public verifiable system. Hopefully money is just the start. Imagine a justice system where the judges don't know your name and know only data relevant to the case; law enforcement are mathematically guaranteed unable to access your data without consent from judges/etc; elections are guaranteed fair; and so on. And all this could be public and verifiable by any individual.

Hi! I think I've found a way to almost unconditionally improve your security: instead of doing a "24 hour deny window" do a "24 hour deny window -&gt; 12 hour accept window". Your current largest threat is a) untrusted computer + user goes 24h without seeing his SMS/email and b) untrusted computer + compromised email + oblivious SMS. a) would be nulled by *requiring* SMS/email access, while b) would remain unchanged.
Even better would be "D hours deny into A hours accept wallet", configurable by the user, with a default like D=24/A=12.

Off topic, I do think there's a sort of atheism cult. I think it's really weird people gathering around and discussing something they *don't* believe in. I've heard the analogy somewhere that it's like some people decided to make a not-a-golf-player club, and start discussing "non-golfism".
There's evidence that we're sort of hard wired into believing there's some grand entity behind things, and believing that relieves depression among other effects. I think people are just filling a religious need, ironically. Not that I mind that at all (or any religion), or what I reckon are similar trends like humanism.

Honestly, this kind of discussion is ridiculous. Maybe they're overvalued, but you're mixing things up.
You think they're overvalued an that's absurd? Bet against it in the market, short it. If you're right you're in for big money. 
But it seems you just think it's absurd that a company (which btw has 450 million users) is valued that much, as it were unfair and an insult to regular workers. So it would be fair for them to stop offering their service overnight?
Now if you have complaints that the median worker is not making much money instead, perhaps I agree -- but that's another issue entirely-- just don't give me nonsense indignation because a company sold for for a lot.

I haven't checked anything, but if they have a public deterministic algorithm so that you can also verify their moves, that would make it indeed provably secure. That is, assuming you can actually reconstruct the whole process in your browser.

The market does not have values. What will happen is Mt Gox will become untrusted and will see it's business fall dramatically in volume; the transactions that do happen on it will occur at a discount -- a premium for unreliability.

This is actually a decent strategy if you intend to buy. If you believe it will recover but are unsure of the bottom price, buy all the way down in proportion to the likelihood  that you think that point will turn over (I'm not sure about details of the math, you may find this in an economy text book I think) -- e.g. buy progressively on the way down and if it reaches the low 600s buy all.

I don't know if it's been discussed, I'm just a casual observer with some scant knowledge. The idea is attractive to me though, you're welcome to spread it. Ideally a good hierarchy for me would keep the *real* transaction cost (for the network) a fixed fraction of the transaction value (plus a very tiny constant).

I agree of course, but the miners are a proxy for the users, simply because Satoshi couldn't find a way to enforce 1 user = 1 vote (instead he had to go 1 hash = 1 vote). If this condition is not being (even roughly) satisfied, maybe it's time for bitcoin to rethink a few fundamentals... it's not like there aren't plenty of technical ideas out there (for the record: ASIC resistance, PoW+PoS, etc).

Well I know they do, but it did not appear to compromise the security of the coin itself. Of course, there's the big problem that the individuals controlling botnets will gain a source of income, but this is more of a criminal issue.
@_date: 2016-01-19 07:07:28
I don't think many people share your view, the widely supported view is that miners are responsible for 'maintaining' the network, and they're rewarded for their activity. The users who conduct transactions are the ones paying rewards.
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:07:09


This is how the network was established, but most people would agree the distribution method is largely irrelevant. Now that said, the point of possible disagreement imo is whether users should always side with primary consensus method (hashing power over a block), or the opposite (as it should be in my opinion): miners follow the users of the network. Maybe it should happen automatically from miners following the users through economic incentives (bitcoin value and hence mining rewards would plunge if users disappear), but it seems to not always be the case and a bit of pro-activity by users seems necessary. I take your point though, we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2016-01-19 03:49:16
I think you're viewing it the wrong way. The fundamental aspect of Bitcoin is *trust*. And this trust should be trust by *users* (majority) on the *system*, not by *users* (majority) on the *current dev team* -- individuals make mistakes, if not today many years from now; while with a good system the will of the user majority will prevail with stability. A dev should enter the game knowing that he isn't really the boss, network consensus is the boss, and both he and the userbase should act accordingly and not be hostage to the whims of the current dev team.
Unfortunately the majority will also make poor decisions now and then, but I don't think this is a problem Bitcoin is designed to solve.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:44:42
That's impressive, but... as far as I know there are already a few alt coins that are "home mineable", a few with sizeable (but not huge) market caps (apparently Monero and Bytecoin are like that). If it did not compromise those, why would it compromise Bitcoin?

As much as this makes sense superficially, I don't think it's true. I think Mike legitimately stopped believing in the future of bitcoin. It's clear he did believe in it's success at the past, just look at one interview from a few years ago. It'd be more productive if you (an the whole community) addressed his criticisms directly. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 03:29:09
I think it's possible to split the chains but then you lose security proportionally. I think the ideal situation would be a hierarchy where transactions of large value are widely replicated and transactions of smaller value are less and less replicated.
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:38:56


Regular encryption can only secure a secret against users without the key, and not magically bind a secret to a person. In the same way, bitcoin can only secure money against non-consensual attacks. 'Mathematically secure' doesn't mean key are not needed at all, or that consensus isn't needed at all, it's just a proof of reliability of the key or of the consensus. Just like you can't plug the [analog hole](

There are ASIC-resistant algorithms. I don't know the details, but ones that employ a lot of ram I believe. If your cost is dominated by ram, which is a commodity basically, everyone will pay almost the same per unit hashrate.
Honestly I think the value of bitcoin is much more in it's ecosystem than the hashing algorithm, they could well change it and that would be for the better imo. The problem would be stopping chinese miners from derailing the process.
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:27:03
Electricity does matter, but I think you can make it so the hardware cost of ram/memory bandwidth itself is much greater than the electricity cost. It doesn't solve the problem completely, but probably equalizes a bit more the landscape.
As other user mentioned, even better would be moving to some kind of proof of stake or pos/pow hybrid; although I haven't been convinced too much by the ones I've seen so far (some unaddressed weaknesses the little I looked). While that doesn't happen a more asic-resistant algo is long due imo.

Well but suppose you don't prohibit. 
Is that better? Suppose you have an emotional lapse and decide to buy some heavy drugs, and after some time you're addicted. Wouldn't it be much better if you simply have not had access? Well, suppose instead you allowed drugs but charged huge taxes to make them less accessible and support addiction relief programs. But then you'd start seeing smuggling and 'Unregistered Drug War', which seems to take the worst of both worlds.
Prohibition seems the least bad solution to me. 
The only thing I disagree are *what drugs* are prohibited. Heroin, crack, meth? Sure. LSD, Marijuana, cocaine? Not worth the huge Drug War hassle.

@_date: 2015-02-07 08:30:35
So what's your proposal? I'm actually proposing something versus just plugging an echochamber rhetoric of "Drug War". You propose legalizing crack/meth/heroin at market prices?
Better yet, let's put some statistics on the table to show that unrestricting drug consumption would likely lead to a death increase in the population:
* Drug overdoses in 2013: 35,663 (plus 5,432 with suicidal intent)
Crime statistics were strangely hard to find. If you have better sources please enlighten me. What I found:
* Drug crime deaths per annum: ~1,100. A large part of drug crime is simply users trying to obtain money to buy it (10-18% of inmates say they commited offense to obtain money for drugs), 5% of homicides seem to be drug-related
So how those numbers compare for you? To me they would indicate the government is actually *not being efficient enough to protect first users*: a large part of drug crime is to obtain money and overdose is the leading cause of injury-related death.
So instead of saying "I don't like your opinion! See, Drug War!", please actually propose something and back it up with data.
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:03:58
Yes, and I think Marijuana or LSD for example should be treated just like alcohol. But Heron/Crack/Meth is a whole other story. Some drugs are powerful enough they completely dismantle your long term ability to get rid of them from just a few uses. You just need to protect people because it's basically a one-off thing.
To be honest, if a person evaluated to be in complete normal state signed a waiver wanting to consume whatever drug acknowledging the risks (and reliving the government to get rid of his addiction too), I'd be okay with that -- it's your life, you do whatever you want with it. But that would basically never be the case.

@_date: 2015-02-08 03:37:55
Ok, then elaborate what you mean by legalize:
Would you be able to sell crack cocaine at convenience stores? Heroin? What about distributing "free samples" to get you addicted? Would you be able to sell to minors? Is 22 or w/e an age the guy/gal is totally able to refuse a free sample of a highly addictive drug while drunk in a party? Would there be cost control? If yes, how is smuggling not going to provoke basically the same crimes? Evidence shows most drug crime in the US is due to drug money acquisition, which would supposedly get higher. How do you make sense of that? Would the mexican drug cartels cease to exist if the us "legalized" drugs? What about the tons of controlled medication like psychiatric medicine which people with mental health have to carefully take?
I bet you can't answer satisfactorily *any* of the questions above, let alone all of them.

Let me tell you how the music industry is structured: 0.1% of the artists get 99.9% of the promotion, revenue, etc. And even for those a minor share of the revenue actually goes into profit for the artist. In the middle there is a massive and completely useless apparatus that exists mostly to sue other companies and make people pay as much as possible for the crappy pop tune of the month. You could easily get rid of this whole thing and get people to pay artists directly whatever you find it worth, or listen from the 100s of years of beautiful musical history we have but doesn't sit well with the industrial model of churning out addictive crappy tunes. Marketing could be eliminated entirely with simple tools for discovery and sharing of music, with no prejudice for genre or how old it is.
This is somewhat realized by something like Spotify, but even Spotify it is redundant and vulnerable to extortion by labels and such.

The measure you provided is definitively artificially inflated for bitcoin -- yes, you can think of it as "If the top500 were trying to hash (and not miners trying to do flops), the btc network would be ahead", but since it uses ultra specified hardware it gets a massive boost at this specific task, which makes the comparison unfair.

If Bitcoin is so certain to you, why didn't you spend lend all you could and kept selling/buying BTC as the price went up? The point is, the market is fairly large and people that believe they have information on it are making the current price (it's a sort of "collective best estimate"). I'm not saying Bitcoin may not be a good investment, especially for long term, but you can't talk down anyone for not investing.

They are entitled their opinion on it, specially concerning something as important as investment decisions. 
Besides, if you could predict the market with very high confidence you can make arbitrarily good returns -- on any market, not just bitcoin -- so it's not sensible to say they could have "gotten more gains in one year than they'll make in their entire life" because every market presents that opportunity.

Since the beginning bitcoin was hyped for microtransactions; however, the way it's structured it just isn't meant for them. Decentralization incurs a pretty large cost on every transaction.
Sure, they could devise a way to sort of subside the micro-transactions with internal rewards, but that's a fragile way of doing it.
Micro-transactions are actually a very good use case for more centralized schemes, possibly backed by bitcoin: they are low risk, require low overhead and quick confirmation.

If you can predict a market you can (for example) lend money to bet on it and raise your money exponentially, for any market with approximately unlimited market cap, regardless of it going down or up.
There's no undeniable consensus on the value of bitcoin say a year from now (I'm sorry if you're blinded by the huge circlejerk here) -- otherwise the market would simply adjust pretty rapidly to that value. Which means "it's nicely and thoroughly explained" isn't enough.

The limit of the return *as your funds go to infinity* is not positive. In fact with no house edge, this limit is strictly 0.
It's an odd thing about mathematics: limits don't actually always reach infinity. If you actually had infinite money (and not analyze *as your money goes to infinity*) however, then yes, you could make the return whatever you'd like.
But then it doesn't make any sense -- what are you betting for if you have +inf money?
Another rant: this to me proves people are irrational. People give edges to the house (negative average return) on *two* exctly opposite situations: 
-People are willing to have a large chance to lose a little and a small chance to gain a lot (lottery)
-People are willing to have a large chance to gain a little and a small chance to lose a lot (this game)
While losing on average on both!
