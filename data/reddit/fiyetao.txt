It's not necessarily switching jobs.. it's being assigned to a new project.

Seriously the lack of reading comprehension in this thread is astounding.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:05:44
Yes he is. Isn't this fun?!
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:43:03
I'm more in a position to be asking the same question tbh. See what's out there, research their merits and future projects. Watch where the hype is going but don't get sucked into it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:41:36
Seriously, there's almost nothing but crushing bias on both subs.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:57:30
You should be worried, but it will be fine.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:49:52
That's being pretty disingenuous.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:22:21
I mean, there will *probably* be another dip. But nothing is certain. You could go half-half, buy now and then buy the dip. Just know that if there's long term potential then 10-15 percent price difference now doesn't matter a whole lot years from now. Like the other guy said, don't play with short term gains unless you really know the market, which very few of us do.

You do understand he was trying to state the argument as the detractors of Core see it, right?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:07:40
It works until it doesn't, at which point you could be fucked.

I will send a clear message by buying more Bitcoin.

Probably not a good idea to surprise him with hardware unless it's purely aesthetic.

The only way to spread out your risk is by diversifying.

Don't wait too long. If you're convinced it's reasonable to hodl, then now is the best time to buy.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:16:22


stupid and dangerous*
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:19:01
I pronounce it "hodl"
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:08:14
I haven't done much sending or receiving so this is new to me. It seems like something both "technical" and inconvenient enough to slow adoption for your everyday person. Do you know of any private wallets, services, or technologies that seek to streamline this process for the average user who just wants to send money cheap and easy?
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:52:00
Good man! Only work with amounts you're willing to lose though. When/if a crash you know what to do. Live long and HODL.

Wouldn't it be more accurate to say these hypothetical music industry execs had the power to destroy yonce's singing voice and make her gain 300lbs by flipping a switch? That might have different implications.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:43:25
I'm saying they affect performance, not value. Over a period of time, bad performance could affect value, no?
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:26:49
And what if LTC does budge? Just because you're not where the action is at right now doesn't mean you're in the wrong place.
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:33:22
We all are. I do believe this statistic will be quite different a year or two from now.
@_date: 2018-03-10 02:30:02
Has been decreasing globally.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:11:33
Except this year is different. Regulation is imminent, the market is fragile and will react very negatively in the short term if it turns out to be strict regulation. It could easily make or break market sentiment for the coming months. Serious buyers are probably waiting to see how this turns out.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:25:38
So they can sell Benz on the moon duh 
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:56:47
Dude, you're asking this in an alternative currency forum.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:42:33
Regulatory uncertainty. People are willing I wait a few days for news from the SEC hearing before they decide to buy. That's going to make or break the market right now.
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:24:38
Don't see many of you folks around here so I think I'll take this chance to ask: could you give me a rundown on setting up a post-standard hydraulics VX rig for mining BTC or direct me to some good sources?
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:20:33
I imagine these statistics change quickly when mania really gets going.

Does anyone get popups ads on this site on mobile?
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:37:25
Can you provide a link to this press conference, or is this some hopium parody?
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:24:20
Cool, if you're a freelance journalist what's your name and where do you publish besides Reddit, using an 11 year old account with no prior activity?
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:30:15
Considering this guy has been trying to link to the website of this "popular trading community," and the OP text seems a little too flattering toward a guy nobody knows about, I'm going to guess it's the owner of the website himself doing some puppet account promotion.
He goes by  on Twitter.
