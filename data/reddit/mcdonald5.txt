Yes the 3 people who bought in 2011 are bragging. The other 90%+ who bought during the bubble are crying.

It doesn't change the amount of bitcoin in circulation.

It's about damn time they started taking people's money. Why did it take them so long? If you have too much money, the government deserves to take it.

I think bitcoin should have a CEO. Who's with me?

Hey did you know that google interest in bitcoin is at a 6. Not sure if it's been posted yet though.

Again with the Wolf of Wall Street memes. If you want to convince people that bitcoin isn't a scam, this isn't the way to do it.

People should stop posting this garbage. 90%+ of people bought during the bubble and are deep underwater in their crypto "investments."

I’ll take the entire world banking system since 1913 for $400, Alex.

BUY BITCOIN. If you aren't spending all your money buying bitcoin then you are a failure. That's why the price is so low. So spend some more of that evil fiat and buy lovely, lovely bitcoin

I'm glad crypto is a good store of value. It only lost 5% today...compared to 3% on the stock market.

Bitcoin would be better if Warren Buffett was running it.
