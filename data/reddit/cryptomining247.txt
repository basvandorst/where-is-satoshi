From another miner:
I agree with all your points. The mining hashrate has tripled since the beginning of the year. Its amazing to see all of the industry innovate, build better and more profitability infrastructure's in such a tough market, but it's not slowing down one bit.

Don't be silly, acquiring the equipment is the easy part, but good luck trying to secure +2000 MW of electricity and building out the infrastructure.

The bitcoin memes were the most exciting part of the solar eclipse.

. They have the power to manipulate +20%  mining profits with ASIC Boost over all other miners. They blocked Lighting Network and many other major BTC improvements because it would decrease profits and level the playing field.
Successfully destroyed Sia and Dash. IMO, they have another few years of control, regardless of their hashrate, we will see BTC developments that remove centralization and mining infrastructures will be less lucrative.

Hah unless your running a mining facility and can post proof, stop talking out of your ass. Your probably using a Bitcoin mining profitability calculator ��, those are there for marketing and in-bound SEO. Extremely inaccurate.
Like this other guy is saying, investing a significant amount of money into miners is way more profitable in the long run than using the same money to buy BTC.
And if you are running an ASIC mining facility, for the love of God, please find someone who knows what they are doing to manage it

Nice, I bought some gear at a BIC Camera in Osaka using BTC last week.
Everytime I mentioned Bitcoin in conversation, people were turning heads looking to talk. I spoke with a few Japanese Hodlers and they tell me it's basically an Crypto Arms Race between the major banks and Internet companies to develop their own coins, roll out ATMs and manufacture new mining tech.
2020 Olympics will be awesome!

Hey, sure thing.
Most of the cloud mining services have their own facilities running different types of rigs and are constantly mining for themselves, including our company; however, there is a massively growing demand for the mining equipment, graphic cards, ect that makes it very hard for people to start mining on their on in their home.
When you sign up for a bitcoin cloud mining contract, you are basically renting the equipment to bypass the hassle and costs. 
There are a lot of sketchy companies doing it unfortunately, but most of the bitcoin mining contracts will show a return on your investment 3-6 months in and profits for the remaining duration of your 1 or 2 year contract.
Hope that helps answer your question :)
