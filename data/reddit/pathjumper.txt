Bitcoin is supposed to be currency, not money. The currency system itself is supposed be liquid and not screw anyone.  If you have a car, you can exchange it for USD. It does not matter whether or not you were around when the currency system was invented or not. Value = currency = value again.
The way bitcoin seeds currency is by giving it to the early adopters.

You realize that that is *exactly* what is meant by "pump and dump", right?

So if it's ok for banks to be kings, it's ok for the handful of early adopters to be kings?

Too much momentum? Not if [market manipulation like this]( keeps happening. The momentum could die if it's not seen as somewhat stable.
I think not.

The war on drugs is an excuse to do whatever they want to citizens not rich enough in this, the land of the rule of wealth.


This is illegal in some states. `[citation neeced]` I know. But there was one case where they were baited in a state where it was legal, found nothing but some lamps and a lawyer waiting for them. No drugs of any kind, obviously.

Such as joining the bitcoin crowd any point after a month or two in.
The later you join, the less you get for your investment.
That is a pyramid scheme telltale.

No one is faulting them.
What is being faulted is the idea that there are going to be a tiny handful of super wealthy, then everyone else.
In other words, there are still masters, they are just different.

Make no mistake. Some people see competing currencies as a very bad thing. Even though other countries have them.

We do not know that they do not have the keys either.


Speculation. Basis?
@_date: 2011-06-14 17:54:57
Whether or not it was intended to be a scam or not is irrelevant. The universe does not care one whit about intentions.
What matters is that 2/3rds of the available supply is in the hands of very few people, who purchased it extremely cheaply - I dare say almost for free in the earliest days - yet they are now among the wealthiest in the world in terms of BTC.
What worries me is the potential for harm to the bitcoin project as a whole that such large stockpiles of BTC in so few hands can do.
Make no mistake, it is a dangerous situation. And what I see from most of the highly upvoted responses in this thread are what appear to be the early adopters themselves - or those that think they are - attempting to justify the vast inequity as though it were somehow reasonable from any perspective save personal greed.
No matter how vehement they get about defending their position, it just does not bear out reasonably and only makes sense from a defending-my-claim-to-have-this-stockpile-while-you-do-not perspective. Personally, I have almost no stake in the system and probably will not until this situation is resolved. Objectively, the currency has a problem in that most of it is owned by very few people. The same would be true of any currency system. The particular characteristics of the system do not matter. I believe this would be problematic for all of them. That this obvious and dangerous imbalance is defended people only makes it look *more* like a pyramid scheme, not less.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:37:09
The difference is bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, not a stock.
In missing an investment in a company you don't get screwed by USD.
Currencies are not supposed to be pyramid schemes.

Foresight is not luck, and neither is having it.
What foresight? Most people have simply never heard of it. You cannot have foresight about something you are completely ignorant of.
Did you know that the invisible pink unicorn has its hooves painted blue? You should have had the luck of foresight, then you'd know that you are supposed to paint one of your toenails blue in order to become rich effortlessly!
That is how ridiculous that "you should have had foresight about something you did not know about" argument is. Excuse me while I get some new blue nail polish.

Bitcoin now has the attention of US Senators who are already trying to defame it. I suspect civil inconveniences not excluding arrest are soon to follow.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:06:15


Then you are not reading very carefully, or I have not communicated clearly enough.


I never heard about the project until a couple of months ago. So I actually did not have as much opportunity as people who did. That is a black and white fact.


What risks? The risks are just starting now that Senators are turning angry eyes at it.


That recreates the existing imbalance. It does not solve it.


I never said I had a proposal. In fact, the submission title is asking if this is a problem, and if there is a solution. Do you have an idea? In the current system, debtors take on debt, but then the creditors get the juice. With bitcoin, the early adopters take on the risk of federal scrutiny and possibly jailtime, and get the lion's share of the currency? I am not saying that this is unfair. I asked if it is good for the system as a whole, in the long term. That system including all adopters for the foreseeable future.


That is the same question I just asked in the OP.
The seeding model of coins is...deserving of having some question marks hung on it, I think. That is all.


@_date: 2011-06-09 03:02:43
I try to operate on as few assumptions as possible.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:23:03
The truly early adopters used nothing but CPU power, and really early on, not much of that.
The more people try and justify its seeding methodology as risky, the more it smacks of a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2011-06-09 02:39:34
I used to do this all the time. They called it Windows. And I did not get a disproportionate stake in the business for doing it.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:56:05
So you are justifying their wealth imbalance, yes? That presumes that you accept that it exists.
Is that imbalance good for the system or not? Would there have been a better way to distribute the wealth.
Here's a solution:
Once Bitcoin has a significant adoption, replace it. Starting from scratch, throw the whole thing out and start over with the entire Bitcoin0 base as the "early adopters". Everybody starts at zero in the new currency. Remember, it is not supposed to be *the* currency, merely *a* currency.
And the key part is, you *keep doing that*, as often as necessary until everyone in the world is basically onboard, and then refresh it again every few years.
Then its a currency, not a pyramid scheme. The bitcoins themselves are not supposed to be intrinsically valuable. Hell, they're just bits in a computer anyway. It the ability to exchange them freely that is supposed to be the goal, right?
Perhaps this pyramid scheme was necessary to get it started, but if it stops here, I will not be on board with such a system, even though I am technically one of the early ones.
@_date: 2011-06-09 02:42:12
At the time, it was closer to 100% of the supply.
The early adopters phase I'm talking about ended months after the project started. If you're starting now and thinking you are an early adopter, you are thinking just as wishfully as the people in the united states who think they own a significant share of the wealth in this country.
@_date: 2011-06-09 02:50:59
You say that now...
@_date: 2011-06-09 02:58:15


This is tangential to your point, but the sad fact of life that is *exactly* the state of wealth in the United States today. 2% of the population owns 80% of all wealth in the country.
@_date: 2011-06-09 02:45:58
You're equating currency with wealth.
A currency is a means to transfer wealth. The currency is not supposed to *be* the wealth. Its the seeding method that is flawed, not the idea.
The fractional reserve system we use today rewards the banks. As a result they're economic juggernauts that basically run the world.  Bitcoins seeding system rewards the earliest adopters, and that gate is long closed.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:33:17
People keep mentioning risk, seemingly failing to realize that the earliest adopters risked nothing but a little CPU time and little to no electricity.
And they are the richest in BTC.
@_date: 2011-06-14 17:41:32
But the contributions are not disparate, and just because they were made *sooner* does *not* mean that they were *greater*. Thus attempting to balance the imbalance by stating that the contribution was greater is false. It was merely sooner, not greater.

Consensus of the source code? I am a software engineer and I know that the practical reality of OSS development is that only approved submitters really matter. Unless you expect rogue clients to crop up and take over organically. That is not outside the realm of possibility, but I would say it is outside the realm of likelihood.
Do not misunderstand me. I like what Bitcoin set about to do, but I am uneasy as to how much it resembles a pyramid scheme. As a currency exchange system it is innovative and impressive. But I believe its method of seeding still needs scrutiny.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:46:17
Currencies are not supposed to be invested in. They're supposed to represent a mutually agreed upon representation of value.
Handing out most of them to the first two people in line and then making everyone else work hard for a smidgen of the same amount is exactly how a pyramid scheme works.
Do not misunderstand me, I love the idea of a distributed decentralized currency. It is beautiful and elegant. But when the particular implementation makes the implementors the richest? I smell a conflict of interest of the most obvious and highest order.
After Ponzi, nobody thought they would be fooled again. Then Madoff proved them all wrong. Is the next name in the list Nakamoto? I sincerely hope not, but I do not see how.
