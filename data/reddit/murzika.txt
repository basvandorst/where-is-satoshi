When you buy a hardware wallet, it comes blank and you need to initialize it first. Then you'll have a HD wallet with possibility to have many accounts (if you need to segragate your balances).
Once you have credited the account, you can indeed let the hardware wallet in a safe. You'll also have a 24 words paper backup, which is quite critical as it protects you against device defaults (after 20 years you never know) or vendor bankrupcy (apps are offline etc). So make sure you keep both (paper and device) in a safe.
The advantage of having a hardware wallet is that your seed will be generated on the device and will never be exposed to any online computer. You can have a look of how it works on the [Nano S interface page](

The Ledger firmware contains a Ledger "master" private key which will sign a challenge from the Chrome app (attestation).
If an attacker would make a clone (it's not possible to inject an unsigned firmware in the Secure Element of a genuine Nano S), then it wouldn't know the Ledger master private key and couldn't sign attestation challenge.
(By master I mean a key only known by Ledger, secure in our HSMs, and changing each batch)

You are mistaken.
The [Ledger Nano S]( manages seed generation and recovery on device, and PIN is entered also directly on device. Transactions are verified on the screen. It is architectured around a secure element, and the apps are open source.
If you were referring to previous generation products such as the Nano Classic, it wasn't using neither password neither obfuscation so I don't know what you are talking about specifically.

This may be true for financial institutions, where the time to market has always been in years anyway, but it totally  ignores the industrial use cases (energy, supply chain, traceability...).

Computer security is not a joke when using the correct tools. For some unknown reason,  the entire Bitcoin industry is ignoring the use of Hardware Security Modules (except Gemini).

A few words about the advantages of a hardware wallet (offline computer) compared to a paper wallet (from our [Nano S presentation blogpost](
**Why the need for a hardware wallet?** 
If you are not familiar with the notion of hardware wallets, you may wonder what would be the advantages versus a paper wallet or an encrypted private key on a computer.
The main principle behind hardware wallets is to provide a full isolation between the cryptographic secrets (private keys) and your easy to hack computer or smartphone. Vulnerabilies of modern PCs and smartphones are well known, and if you keep your private keys there (private key = your bitcoins) it’s just a matter of time before you’ll get hacked and lose everything.
A paper wallet may be secure, but only until you want to use your funds, requiring importing your private keys on your computer. And if you think a password encrypting your keys is enough, malwares are smart enough to wait for the inevitable decryption before sweeping your funds.
Hardware wallets are convenient, affordabe, portable and backuped by a paper wallet allowing an easy recovery in case of loss. If you have any significant amount of bitcoins, using a [hardware wallet]( should be a no brainer.
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:33:32
If you have a fake device, then indeed it's game over.
That's why you need to flash your Trezor device with an official (and verified) firmware; this way you are sure that it is genuine.
Another approach (requiring a secure chip) is cryptographic attestation of the firmware, such as used by Ledger. More information in [this blog post](
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:25:02
You mean instead of the beginning and the end? We could for sure put a srollable display. From our tests however, it looked like people preferred the way it is now rather than seeing all the address scrolling.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:22:37
This is indeed a great feature. We are planning to support plausible deniability on the Nano S, through an alternate PIN code.

What do you mean, I can't trademark it?

Having your own private keys is critical, but it is also important to understand why the local security of these private keys is paramount. This is from our [Nano S presentation blogpost](

It is a different architecture, with different choices regarding the second factor implementations. If you need to compare Trezor to Ledger Nano, here are the facts:
- Trezor uses a regular microcontroller, Ledger uses a secure one (smart card); much more resistant to side channels attacks and physical extraction of secrets
- Trezor has a built in screen to confirm the transactions, Ledger uses the screen of your smartphone (push notifications)
- Trezor is around $119 with shipping, Ledger is around $39 with shipping (depends of your location)
Trezor and Ledger are two very secure hardware wallet, with two different approaches. The choice really depends of your personal preferences.

If your computer is compromized with a malware, it will have unlimited access to your blockchain.info private keys when you are going to log on the service.
With a hardware wallet such as Ledger Nano, private keys are never revealed to the host computer. The PIN code is for physical protection, and the second factor from the security card is an additional layer of security.
So in case of a compromission of your computer by a hacker, with BC.info you'll lose everything, with Ledger (or a TREZOR) you won't lose a satoshi.

Ledger is based on a secure microcontrolller protecting from a large range of logical and hardware attacks. Trezor is not, but has a screen, which is better from ux and also security.
However, Trezor being hacked by software channels or Ledger being hacked through control of two different devices, are both very difficult to execute. It would mean a sophisticated attack targeting you specifically.
So I would say both are equivalent from a security point of view. After it's up to you to decide to which points are more important to you (price, screen, UX...)
Right now, I wouldn't say one product is really superior to the other.
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:05:29
It is indeed like a secret decoder ring. Each security card is unique and is paired to its Ledger Wallet in factory. Of course, it can be quite tiresome to play battleship when you want to sign a transaction. So we'll provide with an option to pair a mobile app and have a better (and more secure) second factor.
@_date: 2014-11-27 09:52:11
Software based wallets are not secure. Even if you have 2FA or if your private keys are stored encrypted on your hard drive, they are available unencrypted in memory when using your wallet.
A malware may have multiple vectors of attacks, such as replacing the JS from blockchain.info code, or hook the crypto librairies to sniff private keys.
The solution is to use hardware wallets which will secure your private keys in a secure microcontroller (smart card). Transaction signature is done inside the smart card, and a second factor is used to verify that it is signing a payment to the correct address.
As of today, there are two products on the market:
* Ledger Wallet (
* Trezor (

Get a [Ledger Nano]( (smartcard based hardware wallet), initialize it on an air gap computer, keep the seed in a safe and the Nano with you.
It combines the safety of cold storage with the possibility to use your bitcoins (make a payment) without having to enter your seed again on a computer.
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:27:50
We are still in the process of adding content to the website, so sorry about the lack of information regarding the card.
At signature time, the wallet will verify 4 letters/numbers from the payment address by asking you to enter the corresponding character for each (it will show "A" and from your code card you enter for instance "3"). This will ensure no malware will have replaced the address to pay when asking the smartcard to sign the transaction.

The relation is that in Bitcoin land, everyone already have a wallet and secure their private key. So there is virtualy no added effort to use BitID; it just works. For SQRL you need to add something new to secure, download an app, etc.

I do not have a negative view on Bitcoin, but I see a major simple risk : the small number of core developers. Only a few people are really contributing, and often with great difficulty to find common ground.
Few people on earth understand how Bitcoin *really* work today. That plus the monolith architecture of Bitcoin which makes impossible to work on side stuff like in other open sources system like Linux.
And how many "big" Bitcoin company contribute on the core development ? This is absurd that they are so focused on their business that they don't care at all about the heart of the technology they are building on.

If you are going to transact with a service, you are going to give a Bitcoin address. So either you create an account by giving a username/email/password, either you only use the Bitcoin address.
There is a clear win in privacy for BitID.


If you give the master public key to the server (so he can verify an address belongs to the correct tree), then the server can derive all addresses and therefore link all your accounts.
This could be a major pricacy leak.
I'm quite a fan of using HD wallets for authentication, because it adds the possibility of revocation and other cool features, but I still cannot find a way to do that while hiding the public master key from the service.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:35:57

@_date: 2014-12-10 11:01:16
Of course, there is a visual confirmation of what you are doing. You can check that this is the Nth character from the address you are verifying.
It is true that a very specialized malware with access to some computing power could map in real time a payment address which could correspond to the challenge.
This problem will be solved with our next software release: pairing a mobile application which will act as a second factor.
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:02:51
Yes exactly. In a few weeks, you will be able to replace the security card by a mobile app (which you will pair using the card, once).
The app will act as a screen and validation button for the card, which will bring better user experience and higher security standards.
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:50:18
If you use the Ledger Wallet with greenaddress, then you have an example of combined hardware wallet and multisignature. The second factor is the second signature. So it is indeed equivalent to use a multisignature or a challenge based confirmation.
However, protecting one of the private key in a hardware wallet is an added security, because total compromise is impossible.  
@_date: 2014-05-17 12:05:40

Something like that yes. The security card brings a much higher level of security, but is still inferior to a screen. That is why it will be upgraded by a mobile app paired to the chip (to get a screen and avoid security card exhaustion).

A lot of people have credit cards, want to acquire bitcoins, but don't have circle in their country. This is the problem brawker is solving. 
If their anti fraud is strong, this is the guarantee of a sustainable business. You have a startup, you know the sacrifices it requires. So you can fully understand it wouldn't make sense to build all that just for a quick buck before your business is destroyed or your are facing jail time.

In a 100% software solution, you can compromise the PC one day (and harvest all private keys), and the mobile another day (harvesting again all keys). 
If the Ledger situation, you need to compromise both in the same time and with a communication channel to sync the hack.
I'd say it would be a magnitude more difficult to achieve such attach in these conditions.

How does the authentication works exactly? I understand the server replies with a bitcoin payment URI, so I guess there is a unique bitcoin address per 402, associated to a token.
Do you scan the blockchain and authorize the token? Or do you request the client to reply with the transaction which will be broadcasted by the server?
How do you check that the visitor is the real bearer of the token? Cause you could send your token to everyone.
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:44:56
Yes exactly. To spend your bitcoins, you need to have with you:
- the Ledger Wallet
- the PIN code
- the security card
If either is missing, you won't be able to sign a transaction.
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:43:08
IDs are not linked to the public ledger. It is only internal control and has nothing to do with the blockchain or Bitcoin per se. Only crypto currencies are concerned with this first euro rule ; this is indeed not a law but a "strong" recommendation from the authorities pending future precise regulation.
I'm not going to debate if this right or not right, it is what it is. You just have to understand you have a choice. If you want to buy bitcoins without showing any ID, just use localbitcoin or mycelium trading tool. The existence of regulations for professional businesses such as ours doesn't have any impact on the street exchange.

It is completely decentralized (no third party server), and there is no leak of privacy. You are "identified" by the public Bitcoin address of your choice.

If this system gets in place (which would be really awesome), land ownership would be proven by cryptographic signature of a challenge (proof of control of the private key).
This means you can't use cold storage, but need to have your private key available for signature in a computer or device.
In the generic use of Bitcoin, private key compromission leads to loss of wealth, in this case hacks would lead to catastrophic consequences (land eviction, etc).
You can use multisignature, but you still need to protect yours (and the others).
I'm pretty sure this is a use case where hardware wallets are of a mandatory usage. You can't build such a solution without also bringing a strong layer of security for the end user.
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:47:46
I'm the CEO and co-founder of La Maison du Bitcoin (a Bitcoin center in Paris), and Ledger (a secure hardware wallet).
Our company was in business relation with HSBC since 2011, and everything was fine until we pivoted to Bitcoin in 2013.
A few months ago, HSBC notified us of termination of all our accounts, including our subsidiaries' which are not at all related to Bitcoin.
They never wrote the real reason, but discussions with our bank managers revealed it was of course related to the fact we were dealing with crypto-currencies.
We had another bank account (in another bank), which we "unfroze" following the HSBC's notification. As soon as they discovered that we where the company behind "La Maison du Bitcoin", we received a registed letter closing also all accounts.
I have met with the president of the bank, who stated he didn't have the choice, that he had "to chose his battles". The French regulator put huge pressure on him to close all businesses related to Bitcoin, even if there is nothing illegal in it.
We are now trying to operate under the radar by opening accounts in unsuspecting banks. But it is not easy when you are running a Bitcoin center with huge "B" on the street windows.
All this give us even more legitimacy and motivation in our efforts to build an alternative of the banking system, based on digital identities, full decentralization and power of the open &amp; distributed consensus security systems.

As explained in this thread, not all is open source because of NDAs (it's not our choice, these are the implications or using secure elements).
However, open source doesn't imply that the device you are receiving is flashed with what you think it is. At the end, you must trust the vendor.
Secure elements have the possibility to prove that it is executing the code with the results you expect. Once it will be implemented, it will be the best secure layer possible, open source or not.

The Chrome Application is open source: 
The Ledger Wallet itself is open spec: 
The firmware is not open source - as vendor NDAs prevent us from releasing a source code that would be of any use to our users. However, the specifications are fully open and detailed, and all cryptographic operations are deterministic, which allow any user to verify that the card is answering what it should and that there is no side channel. 
We believe that validating both the card behavior and the clients behavior against the specifications should provide enough confidence to the users - also, this approach is widely used in the smartcard industry, typically to obtain security certifications for banking and identity products.
@_date: 2014-11-27 12:02:00
Software based wallets are not secure. Even if you have 2FA or if your private keys are stored encrypted on your hard drive, they are available unencrypted in memory when using your wallet.
A malware may have multiple vectors of attacks, such as replacing the JS from blockchain.info code, or hook the crypto librairies to sniff private keys.
The solution is to use hardware wallets which will secure your private keys in a secure microcontroller (smart card). Transaction signature is done inside the smart card, and a second factor is used to verify that it is signing a payment to the correct address.
As of today, there are two products on the market:
* Ledger Wallet (
* Trezor (

In the event of a man in the middle attack, a malware could change the destination address and ask the Ledger Wallet to sign it. As the Nano doesn't have a screen, you may wonder how it is possible to verify the address before signing the transaction.
The Nano is paired to a unique security card, which will be needed each time you need to make a payment.
When asked to sign a transaction to a payment address, the chip will select 4 random letters or numbers from the address and send it as a challenge to the wallet software. You will have to enter the correspondent symbol for each (using the security card), and only the correct combination will authorize the chip to sign.
So, if a malware change the payment address, you will visually see that the random sampling does not correspond to the address you know.
In the coming weeks, we'll update the process by releasing a mobile application (iOS, Android) which will act as a screen for the Nano. The user experience will therefore be much better.

BitID is primarely targeted for services where it makes sense to authenticate with a Bitcoin address, either because you need to give a return address or because you are transacting with the site.
The logic is that you are going to give a Bitcoin address anyway, so there is no privacy leak.
Also, the wallet could automaticaly generate and store Bitcoin addresses for each service. You wouldn't have to manage/remember them yourself.

Maison du Bitcoin co-founder here.
Right now there are only recommendations from regulators about running a physical Bitcoin exchange in France. One of them is to do ID verification from first euro.
For other currencies ID is requested from 8,000 EUR.
We believe that complying with strict regulation is the best way to start our operations, work with regulators, and little by little build a more fair environment. We hope in the near future to operate in the same conditions than other currencies.
Of course, we could say "GFY" and do whatever we want, but this would be extremely short term sighted.

Before signing a transaction, the Ledger Wallet chip will send a challenge to the "interface". This challenge will ask to verify 4 letters/numbers from the destination address using a security correspondance card.
It will show "A", you'll enter "2" (depending of your security card, which is unique and paired to the chip in the factory), etc.
If the challenge is correct, the chip will sign the transaction.
Having a screen is of course better from a user experience point of view. What we are doing is a trade of. The evolution of the second factor integrating a mobile app will solve this problem (the mobile will be the screen and confirmation button of the chip).
We are right now producing a video showing exactly how this process works.

I didn't check your calculation but you are probably right.
As we said before, this is tradeoff between absolute security and convenience. On our roadmap is an update which will solde this problem (release in a few weeks). Users with a smartphone will have the possibility to replace the card with a 2FA mobile app.
The security card will be used only to pair the wallet with the 2FA, so occurence will be very limited (at initialization and when changing/losing phone).
In this configuration, a malware wouldn't have any vector of attack.

At Ledger, we design and sell secure hardware wallets. Our mission is to solve the end user security problem. Bitcoin cannot go mass market without simple and efficient security solutions.
This approach is fully decentralized. We have absolutely no control of the bitcoins of our users.
And I can assure you that we found great interest from VCs to invest into the development of our company. The fact that we had absolutely nothing to do with regulation and compliance was a very strong point. This, and the global aspect of Bitcoin, allowing us to sell the same product without hassle anywhere in the world.
So it not true to say VCs build or invest only in centralized solutions. There is a genuine interest into other approaches.

Compromising both your computer and you smartphone in the same time is indeed a theorical possibility but would be extremely hard to achieve. We are working on prototypes embedding a screen, which I agree will add another layer of security.
However, if you want to reach far fetched possibilities, Trezor is then as insecure as a software wallet also (see their bounty page, guess who got it). No one can win at this game.
Trezor is a very good product, lead by a reputable team. We just have opposite views on architecture and vision. That doesn't mean any product is superior to the other. Consumers have choice, and that's a win.

Yes, SQRL is acknowledged on the full protocol description on Github. Our approach is mainly the same, but focused to Bitcoin specifications.
The problem with SQRL is that no one uses it, as there is a need to install a specific application on your mobile.

As there is no central authority, it is not possible to revoke access like you could do it using a certificate.
There are however at least two solutions :
* establish a back channel with the service, such as verifying your email so you can revoke all accesses (but this would be dependent of each service)
* add an extension to the BitID protocol, using for instance Namecoin, such as [described here]( (in Protocol extensions section)

I was in the meetup where OP pitched brawker more than a year ago. My first reaction was evidently about credit card fraud. It is an obvious risk. Since, I have been convinced by the seriousness and the commitment of brawker to mitigate fraud using data analysis. So far, they never had a problem with credit card fraud. And they process a lot of transactions every day. Of course, there will be one day some accident, but risk zero doesn't exist anyway. 
Brawker is developing a long term vision, based on a viable business model. People need brawker because it is an organization original and efficient way to buy bitcoins with a credit card.

If you lose your private key, you are basicaly doomed. The assumption is that you already have many backups as it's your Bitcoin wallet.
In case of compromission, there is a need for a back channel to revoke the access. On the BitID github, there is a prototype sketch based on the Namecoin blockchain.

It is not a multisignature transaction, it is a different approach. The chip will sign only if a verification challenge (based on the payment address) is completed.
This challenge is solved/signed on the mobile app after confirmation by the user that the payment address and amount are correct.
There is no central server.
The private keys (in our case the private master seed) cannot be extracted from the device. This is all the point of using a secure element.

Let's say they their super efficient chips are mining at 0.10W/Gh (for comparison Spoondolies Tech chips are rated 0.36W/Gh, so it's already a huge gap). Let's also say that they'll be allowed to pump 5W (an iPad charger is 12W). Then you'll get a chip mining at 50Ghs.
50Ghs, at current difficulty, will give you 0.0005 BTC per day. Which we could adjust at 0.0004 BTC after 21's impact on the difficulty. On a washing machine, I guess you could put 20 chips mining for 1 THs and get 0.008 BTC / day, which is 0.30 BTC / month. If the initial wattage assumption is correct, then it's not too bad for a washing machine. Enough BTC to order monthly detergent or maintenance stuff.

Using hardware wallets, which by design cannot leak any private key (master or child), also solves this vulnerability.

Open source vs closed source is not good vs evil. Using secure element implies closed source for NDAs related to the chip manufacturer.
We have a detailed specification on which the Ledger can (and will be) certified for. It is possible to demonstrate that the firmware is behaving exactly like it is suppose to behave.
Also, a secure element is a magnitude more secure than a regular micro controler when you are in the field of protecting secrets.
We do have a front end, it is just different than the Trezor. The user can verify what the user is signing using a securit card or a paired smartphone. This is a different approach, which has its advantages (a thief with the HW and the PIN can't do anything) and its disavantadges (it's not stand alone as you said).
Our next generation wallet will include a screen/button as well as BFC/BLE capabilities.
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:39:59
There is no definitive solution. Security is always based on trade offs. Ultimately you always need to put trust in some element of the chain. 
You may compile yourself the open source firmware and flash it, but what if your micro controller embeds rogue microcode in its ROM? This is tin foil hat level of course, but what you perceive as tin foil hat may vary.

@_date: 2015-01-31 19:58:38
Again this is only when you get hold physically of the Trezor. And as you already said, physical security was never a feature you promoted.
We successfully performed a (trivial) attack on the PIN, which has been fixed in the software update. We were planning to demonstrate another attack and show it on video, but after all what happened recently we didn't feel it would be appropriate.
If you are game, we can make a public challenge:
* you send us a Trezor with 1 BTC on it, without the PIN of course
* we send you a Ledger Wallet with 1 BTC on it, **and** we give you the PIN (without the second factor security card)
The first to break in the other one's wallet (transfer the 1 BTC on a specified address), and document the attack (so it can be fixed), wins.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:06:00
You will see that it is possible to have an external screen (on a paired smartphone) and achieve very strong levels of security. When you don't have your smartphone with you, a transaction can be signed with the security card only.
It may look less "integrated", but obvious advantage is that is someone sees your PIN and steals your Ledger they won't be able to do anything with it.
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:58:14
This particular attack has been fixed yes, but there are many other possibilities. The ultimate one being to attack the chip core and re-establish the JTAG for debug mode. Game over. It has already been demonstrated (on other devices, not the Trezor).
Regular micro controllers cannot resist these low cost physical  attacks. It's perfectly normal, they are not designed with security in mind.

Luke is right. The firmware is closed source, and it will stay this way because of NDAs with secure chip manufacturers. We do have [very precise specifications]( which will be the base of a future certification (proving that the chip does what it is supposed to do).
The Chrome app and the mobile apps are open sources.

You just need a few minutes to glitch the device and break the PIN with a special device. One you have the PIN you can do pretty much what you want.
Cost of the hacking device is under $50, cost of lab to design this device is under $5,000.
As long as you have the device in your hands you are safe. Other attacks such a listening to the RF emission of the chips are for the moment only theorical but completely doable (glitching has actually been done with success on the Trezor, RF analysis not).

The difference lies in [attestation]( How can a Trezor user know they are having a genuine product and not an intercepted copy with a rogue firmware?

@_date: 2015-01-31 19:07:04
You can build an app on a HW1 or Ledger Wallet. This is basically what software wallets are doing. They implement all the UI and business logic, and the critical crypto (signing transaction) is done inside the hardware wallet.
What is important is that the private keys are **never** exposed to the software. So if you really need the private keys on the screen  (I couldn't think of a valid reason to do that) then there is absolutely no solution.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:41:45
It's a 1:1 clone for 1/3 of the price so I guess it's a good deal yes. PCB is clean, doesn't look more fragile than the original. 
Just flash the Trezor firmware and you are good to go.
After there is the moral issue of which company/efforts you should really support, but Trezor is an open source/hardware project, so I'm pretty sure they see this clone as a positive consequence of their strategy.

Yes that's true. [Ledger Wallet]( (a hardware wallet based on a smartcard) is natively compatible with BitID and we are going to release very simple APIs for integration.
Basically, you'll just insert your Ledger Wallet in the computer and it will autolog you on any BitID supported website (as long as they integrate our JS API of course).
We'll use a specific BIP44 derivation root for BitID based on a hash of the URL, so you'll have a unique address for each website (we'll also update the BitID BIP draft so everyone can use the same scheme for maximum compatibility).

The MITM attack is covered in the article, and yes a smartcard doesn't change anything for that. It is just a question of architecture. And a screen do not have to be on the hardware wallet, it can be deported to an external device such as a smartphone.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:47:29
A paired smartphone acts as a screen and button for the Ledger Wallet for second factor validation. This is a secure alternative allowing a much lower price point.
Also, Ledger is built on a secure element. If stolen, it is virtually impossible to extract the private keys. Trezor can be physically hacked in minutes. See [this article]( for more informations.

Ledger has a second factor confirmation allowing to check what the chip is signing:
* solve a challenge based on a unique security card and the destination address (see  for a demo, at 2:25)
* pair a smartphone (once, using the security card), and you confirm/reject on your mobile with a full visual confirmation of the transaction (see

By without the PIN, I mean you send us a TREZOR with a PIN but without revealing the PIN :) 
I agree that you never marketed TREZOR as a physical security solution. I also agree that TREZOR + PIN + passphrase would be totally secure against breaking the chip.
TREZOR and Ledger Wallet are two different and complementary approaches (open hardware and open source vs specifications based design and secure element).
Anyway, the real race now is to bring the best in class NFC/BLE/e-ink hardware wallet. And there is a new cooool kid on the block :)

That's fair. We believe however physical security will be more and more important. Hardware wallets are easy to recognize and mass adoption will trigger a new kind of criminality.
If you can steal and empty a hardware wallet (without having the PIN) in 5 minutes, that's very bad. Hopefully, before Bitcoin will get traction, Trezor will have switched its architecture to a secure element.

Generic micro controllers are not made to resist glitching attacks, that's why critical application devices must always rely on secure elements (which is the reason of their existence). 
Adding a passphrase to your Trezor device would void all these attacks. It is therefore highly recommended to do that if you think theft or physical interception are a possibility.

No it's not possible.
Why? Because as soon as the secure key goes out of the secure environment (TrustZone, TEE, HSM, HW...) then it's compromised.
The only solution is to have all your critical operations such as signing a transaction go inside the secure execution.
This is what hardware wallets and HSM are going.

Of course it is safe, that's the point of being a hardware wallet. We use second factor authentication to verify what the chip is signing.

That is why side channels resistant hardware wallets (based on secure elements) are a necessity. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:18:32
Critical code will always be in the secure element for obvious reasons, so majority of the heavy lifting will be closed source. 
However the open source can be used as a gate to the IO, verifying that what the secure chip signed is indeed what it was supposed to sign. 
In this architecture, a rogue closed firmware couldn't go through the open source control system.

We can't open source our firmware, as it is restricted by the chip's NDA. We fully understand that some members from the community want only open source, this is why our next product will have a regular microcontroller + a secure one, where it'll be possible to run 100% open source code (the secure chip being deactivated in this mode). 
Hobbyists will be able to hack our products as much as they want and use it for any kind of application. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:00:56
Why does it have to be open source, I wonder? I understand the idea behind that is source scrutiny, to check there is not backdoor, but the same result can be achieved through certification.
Certification is the process to demonstrate that your product is conform to a set of specifications. This is the backbone of the military and banking security industry for decades.
I therefore fully support the existence of both open source and closed source solutions.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:11:45
Ledger is also optimizing what I guess you consider the "right" part. See slide 7. The bug found and reported by Ledger to Trezor allowed to dump remotely the seed on the USB.
Regarding the initialization part of Ledger, you are completely right, you need to do it on a secure computer such as booting on a ChromeOS USB key (we have a step by step tutorial). Once it's done, the seed will never go out of the secure element.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:43:32

This is in fact some kind of equivalent of doing a certification against our own specifications (as it is done in the banking industry).
We have very precise specifications:
It is therefore possible to fully test the behavior of the secure chip. Normally it is done by specialized companies issuing certifications, but it could be done in real time by the open source component (at least for the critical parts).
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:59:26
In my opinion the problem is not related to open sourcing the firmware. If the three keys where correctly separated, there would be no need to trust the device. 
The main issues are that: 
* Case can steal the funds by colluding with Third Key Solutions (this is hypothetical of course)
* a thief can steal all the funds by getting the device and a print (there is no PIN)
* you must monitor Case's health all the time, and empty your wallet as soon as they go out of business (because if you lose your Case, there is only one key left, the one from Third Key solutions)
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:10:03
Then we would need an open source smartcard, and I'm pretty sure it defeats the purpose. Hardware security is mainly based on obscurity hence the NDAs.
Maybe one day there will be a new breakthrough hardware technology based on local unbreakable open consensus, but right now this is not the case.
Building a hardware wallet on non secure elements is (in our opinion) a fatal mistake. So we are back to square one, closed source.
I understand and respect your position.

* pair a smartphone (once, using the security card), and you confirm/reject on your mobile with a full visual confirmation of the transaction (see 
The second method will be available with the next firmware release, in the coming weeks.

You would still have to enter your PIN and second factor.
However, if you build an app based on the HW1 in server mode, it will act like an HSM and second factor/PIN will not be active. You'll then be able to do exactly what you describe.

You are completely wrong. I don't understand why people have the urge to write stuff when they don't know the first thing about the subjects they present themselves as knowledgeable. 
The Ledger products use a second factor confirmation on a cryptographically secure screen (on your smartphone). If your computer is compromised the second factor will show that the destination address has been altered. 
Regarding initialization, it can be done securely and easily with the Ledger Starter (a 5$ bootable USB key also available free for download).

Blockchain technology, public or permissionned, relies on cryptography and thus the ability to keep private keys safe. Permission vs proof of work is a matter of consensus, but in both case ownership of digital assets is materialized by the knowledge and control of a cryptographic secrets. 
Even in permissionned blockchains, you still need to securely sign transactions and make sure that private keys (at the user or server level) are not compromised.

Here is the answer from Ledger: 
@_date: 2016-03-17 11:18:07
It is a different architecture, with different choices regarding the second factor implementations. If you need to compare Trezor to Ledger Nano, here are the facts:
- Trezor uses a regular microcontroller, Ledger uses a secure one (smart card); much more resistant to side channels attacks and physical extraction of secrets
- Trezor has a built in screen to confirm the transactions, Ledger uses the screen of your smartphone (push notifications)
- Trezor is around $119 with shipping, Ledger is around $39 with shipping (depends of your location)
Trezor and Ledger are two very secure hardware wallet, with two different approaches. The choice really depends of your personal preferences.

FIDO U2F is basically a replacement of the Google Authenticator numbers you must enter each time you wish to login securely on a service (such as Google, Dropbox, Github...).
FIDO U2F keys usually exist as a USB dongle which you insert on your laptop when requested, but they don't work with smartphones. Ledger has developed a FIDO U2F app for the Unplugged NFC card (which has been certified by the FIDO Alliance).
When you log on Github (which is the first to have integrated NFC support), just tap your Unplugged on the back of your phone, and you are authenticated. No need anymore to go back and forth between apps to copy/paste a security code.

Nano S and TREZOR have the same 2FA mechanism: a screen to confirm a transaction. 
Neither are immune to the wrench attack (modulo the possible use of a plausible deniability passphrase, but that won't work all the time).
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:26:42
The cryptographic secrets (private keys) are safeguarded by a ST31 secure chip which features a lot of hardware protection against extraction and reverse engineering. These chips are used in many critical mission application such as passports or credit card. 
Cost of attack in laboratory is not only  very high but also very time consuming (weeks), letting you the time to move your funds to another seed.

The Chrome app run on the host and are the global UI, managing your accounts and connecting to the blockchain.

You can buy the a NFC card directly on Fidesmo's website ( and then buy the Ledger app. It'll be a full equivalent of the Unplugged.
We stopped selling it directly because there was too much customer support needed: NFC is not working well (generally speaking) and depending of the phone and the environment the communication with the card didn't work well all the time.
@_date: 2017-01-19 12:14:20
Using the same cryptographic attestation mechanism. Ledger's secure element contains a root of trust which can sign a challenge and proof it's genuine. You could do a replica of a Nano S, but you wouldn't be able to inject the root of trust.
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:24:49
The security differences are mainly:
- use of secure chip vs non secure chip 
- runs multiple apps in full isolation 
- anti tampering firmware through cryptographic attestation 
Regarding usage, it's quite identical (except the benefit of multiple apps allowing more possibilities). The differences are mainly in the host software (mytrezor vs our Chrome app).
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:24:34
When you generate a new seed (from which all your private keys/addresses will be deterministically derived), the Nano S will show 24 words that you'll write on a recovery sheet. This is your backup.
To restore a seed, you'll have to enter 24 words in the Nano S (we have a clever mechanism to do that with just the device, no computer required). You can of course generate a custom seed of 24 words and recover it in the Nano S instead of having the device generate it.

**Why the need for a Hardware Wallet?**
If you are not familiar with the notion of hardware wallets, you may wonder what the advantages are versus a paper wallet or an encrypted private key on a computer.
The main principle behind hardware wallets is to provide full isolation between the cryptographic secrets (private keys) and your easy to hack computer or smartphone. Vulnerabilities of modern PCs and smartphones are well known, and if you keep your private keys there (private key = your bitcoins) it’s just a matter of time before you’ll get hacked and lose everything.
A paper wallet may be secure, but only until you want to use your funds, requiring importing your private keys on your computer. And if you think a password encrypting your keys is enough, a malware is smart enough to wait for the inevitable decryption before sweeping your funds.
Hardware wallets are convenient, affordable, portable and backed up by a paper wallet allowing easy recovery in case of loss. If you have any significant amount of bitcoins, using a hardware wallet should be a no brainer.

If you do not plan whatsoever to use your funds, then yes I agree. But if you do, a hardware wallet is much more convenient (and if it gets wiped by an EMP, then you still have your paper wallet backup).
The HW.1 costs only 15 EUR, which is very reasonable.

**Regarding the features of the Ledger Blue**
It is most advanced compared to the Ledger Nano S mainly because of the following:
- Large 3"5 touchscreen
- USB/NFC/Bluetooth communications
- Enterprise app licensing &amp; support
Generally speaking, Ledger's products are more advanced for the following reasons:
- Cryptographic secrets protected by an EAL6+ Secure Element (ST31)
- Built-in onboarding and configuration (seed generation and recovery)
- Certified FIDO U2F (second factor authentication for Google, Github, Dropbox, Dashlane and many others)
- Based on BOLOS architecture (multiple independant apps running in isolationon top of OS, vs bloated firmware updates packing a growing number of features potentially menacing security integrity)
- awesome design &amp; UX (but this one may be subjective)

In case Ledger goes out of business, this wouldn't affect your bitcoins at all. It doesn't matter if you would be using a third party software or the Ledger Chrome app: you are always in control of your seed (the 24 words), and you can therefore recover access to any BIP44 compatible wallet. It would be at worst an inconvenience.
Of course, if you are using Electrum, your Ledger product would continue to be usable with or without the existence of Ledger as a company.

Our firmware integrates the plausable deniability PIN, but it is not supported yet by our Ledger Chrome app. Basically the idea is to show a differend seed when you enter your other (valid) PIN.
It is an interesting approach, but I'm not sur that a passphrase or an alternate PIN would be a real solution to the wrench attack. If someone targets you for your bitcoins, it's because they perfectly know that you do have a lot of them. You couldn't even say that you just spent them all, as the tx history wouldn't support this claim.

All our products are indeed assembled by hand, and we need to do some cutting to insert the chip in the metal holder. The white defaults are corrected using a pencil (if the paint gets off, then you see the white plastic).
Regarding the traces on the golden connector, it is perfectly normal: it has been inserted once in factory for initialization. We understand it's a concern, and that you may ask yourself how you could be sure that the device has not been tampered on the way by a third party. We invite you to read this article explaining why this is not a security risk: 
We try to always get the best possible quality on our assembly line, and if the device you got is not up to our normal standards, we'll gladly send you a new one.

Yes you can, using myetherwallet.com or mycrypto.com 
@_date: 2016-09-05 09:47:32
Ledger is using [cryptographic attestation]( of its firmware, which gives proof that the device is genuine and has not been tampered with.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:19:04
The vulnerability requires **physical access** to the device **before setup of the seed** and a precise set of pre-conditions. We'll communicate more specifically about it later as specified in our initial blog post.
@_date: 2016-09-03 07:37:36
Can confirm. I have the same issue.
@_date: 2016-09-20 11:37:00
If you can get a free replacement by TREZOR then that's great, but I don't think that you have anything to fear. An attacker would have certainly replaced the tamper sticker by another one.
If someone invested a few thousands dollars to build TREZOR clones with a set of known seed or an address change when a minimum amount is seen, then they would most probably also print a few replica of tamper evident seals.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:09:31
The culprit is the load on our servers, definitely not issues on the device. Thank you for your patience.

Managing the security of your backup is critical for any wallet, hardware or software. If you wish to own your keys, you have to secure their recovery.
@_date: 2019-01-07 04:13:35
Bluetooth is just a bearer, like USB. The Nano X has been designed under the principles that the connection can always be compromised, Bluetooth itself therefore doesn't change the security model. Transactions are always physically checked on device (requiring to press both buttons), and private keys of course never leave the secure element. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:01:49
After the update, you must install again your apps. Please refer to our step by step guide for the procedure. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:50:08
This is not the case. As I told you many times, all details will be published on March 20th, with independent analysis.
We maintain our opinion that this is not a critical vulnerability. Saleem thinks it is. This is a sterile debate to have now since we can't share any technicalities.
@_date: 2016-09-15 19:23:30
Well, I guess we can conclude from this piece that TREZOR 2.0 will not be architected around a Secure Element.

Hardware wallets give full isolation between the host computer and the private keys. Even in case of total compromission of the system (pc, internet, chrome...) it's not possible to extract private keys or sign/broadcast a non user approved transaction.

The firmware 1.4.1 update brings several UX and security changes:
- Possibility to install more apps on the device
- Better screen lock management
- Full 24 words backup validation enforced
- Misc UX optimizations (faster device)
- Misc security improvements
To update your device, please [refer to our step by step guide](
More information about the firmware available on [our firwmare 1.4.1 FAQ](
**How many apps can I have on my Nano S with 1.4?**
One of the user experience gains of the 1.4 is the possibility to install much more apps on the Nano S. The global limitation is related to the small amount of memory available on the device. The new firmware doesn't expand the memory, but optimizes the size of Bitcoin related apps.
Many cryptocurrency projects are clones of the Bitcoin blockchain and therefore share most of the signature code (such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Zcash, Komodo, Stratis, Posw, Pivx, Viacoin, Vertcoin, Stealthcoin, Digibyte, Qtum, Hcash...). By refactoring all common codes in a library (hosted in the Bitcoin app), we were able to significantly lower the size of the other apps. On this principle, it is possible to install up to 18 apps sharing this library.
But if you install apps with a completely different code base (for instance: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, FIDO U2F, Password Manager) you'll still be limited to 4 or 5 apps.
In conclusion, depending of the type of apps you install, you'll see a very different result. Most probably, you will be in the 10 to 12 apps range.
Tip: when the dashboard has many apps (&gt; 10), the device will freeze for a few seconds just after entering the PIN. This is due to the time necessary to sort the apps to display. A temporary fix would be to remove all apps and install them in the alphabetic order (a future firmware update will address the slowdown).

This wouldn't change at all the security model. Using BLE transport is as secure as USB. Breaking the encryption transport (which is not trivial) would only potentially breach privacy (like exposing your public address to the hacker). Private keys never leave the secure chip of the hardware wallet.

It was even in our right to not even mention it was a security update, but just some infrastructure requirements. Now is not the time to say more, you'll get everything on March 20th. From us, and from Saleem.

Deleted means the owner didn't pay the yearly fee, thus destroying the domain. New indicated someone bought again the domain. After the last creation in 2008, it has been transferred a lot of times. 
However a transfer doesn't imply a change of ownership. This is a just a change of primary and secondary nameservers, which could occur for different reasons.
Most probably, one of these transfer where the result of the sale of the bitcoin.com domain to Roger Ver, but we can't deduce which one exactly.

Ledger's products (Nano and HW1) are virtually immune to physical attacks thanks to the use of secure elements (smartcards).
This topic is covered here: 
If you use a passphrase with your Trezor, then you are also completely immune.

The Ledger Wallet is not a USB flash drive. It is a smart card protecting your private keys and signing transactions (or messages) inside its secure enclave. The point of a hardware wallet is to give you best in class security regarding your bitcoins.
The BitID login is just leveraging this already existing security to give you another benefit.

Because everything is cryptographically signed from end to end, following an offline key exchange (using the security card).
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:56:49
We are using websockets so the communication is going through a Ledger server acting as a rendez-vous point. We are going to release soon an offline signing feature (using QRcode scans) so mobile 2nd factor would work even if your phone doesn't have network access.
@_date: 2015-04-01 13:18:26
It's more or less the same thing, but with slightly different approach. If we have requests to implement BitAuth on the Ledger Wallet we'll gladly do it.
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:47:42
Why did you use a proprietary protocol, and not BitID/BitAuth?
@_date: 2016-09-15 21:18:29
You are always dealing with proprietary blobs at some level (STM32's bootloader from instance).
But ultimately the full open source / open hardware approach requires you to securely source and assemble yourself your devices. This is the only way to mitigate interception attacks.
It's of course a valid model, but which hardly scales for a more mainstream target. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 05:34:58
Did you restart the process? Sometimes it hangs, but if you insist (adding/removing/adding...), or restart the update (closing the Chrome app and relaunching it) it should finalize.
What is your operating system?
@_date: 2015-04-10 06:12:42
Useless without the passphrase yes. So whatever you derive in the crypto lib is not based on the correct extended private key. 
Of course, if you enter the passphrase while under attack (usb cable hijacked for instance) then it's game over. 
So you are not in fact completely immune. If you want real security, use real security chips and not general purpose hardware. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 05:50:24
At a $600 fee per bit citizen, that would be indeed a very good operation for Trezor. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:59:52
no, just use a passphrase if you think someone could get physical access to your Trezor.
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:08:42

Yes you are right, obviously. I meant by design. Hardware wallets do not have any implemented way to allow extraction of the private keys. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:57:20
No, that means the code linked to is a fork from another project, Mycelium Wallet, on which we are working to add Ledger compatibility.
With Ledger integration, the critical crypto will be run inside our secure element, so it is not important for us that the Android crypto lib is not optimal.

In the phone+pc solution, you just need to have one element infected (the one handling the private keys) to get fully compromised. 
If private keys are on the PC, then no point having a mobile app (to do what?), as your private keys are immediately exposed to any attacker.
If private keys are on your phone, then why do you need a PC? It wouldn't add more security than the current mobile decentralized wallets.
@_date: 2015-09-18 19:26:15
Yes you can, our hardware wallets are fully interoperable. You can restore your seed on the Unplugged, import one or many accounts in Mycelium and get access to the same transactions and addresses.
@_date: 2015-09-28 05:26:37
As we are using secure elements, we are bound by NDA to not reveal the chip's APIs (this is part of the current security by obscurity model of this kind of architecture). Therefore we cannot publish our source code, nor could you compile yourself anyway, by lack of tools. 
The attestation being embedded in our firmware, it is therefore not open source either. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:12:09
Which path are you using? The Coinkite path should be the following: 
    m/0xb11e'/0xccc0'/index

Multisig based on two devices (one mobile, one PC) can be totally compromised step by step in a definitive way: first you compromise the PC, getting the master private key A, then you compromise the mobile, getting the master private key B.
These attacks can occur in different time, and once they are done compromission is absolute.
Using hardware wallet + second factor requires that both attack must occur on the same time, with full synchronization, and compromission  is limited to the attack timeframe (if you extract private keys you can decide of when you'll do the attack, regardless of your possibility to maintain your breach open).
Also, if you don't have your mobile, you still can validate a transaction using your security card.
The Nano, in conjonction with a 2FA smartphone, brings very high security standards for a fraction of the competition's price. 
We will bring other products to the market, being the Ledger Blue (BLE/NFC HW with screen) or the Ledger Trustlet (virtualized hardware wallet running in the secure enclave of your Android phone).

You can always print a duplicate on paper using the security card hex code on your recovery sheet. Also, the card is much more resilient to scratches than it looks. If you normally keep it in a wallet the ink will stay solid.

Maybe you are trying o install the application twice?
@_date: 2015-09-10 07:59:17
When one element of the path is not hardened (the 1 in m/0xb11e'/0xccc0'/1), then our derivation xpub is not the same than with bitcoinjs (which bip39 site uses). It's just an encoding difference, the point on the elliptic curve is the same). So all derived addresses (m/i) will be identical.
In conclusion, if you enter the xpub in Mycelium it'll give you the same addresses tree.
But what are you trying to achieve? You'll never see your Coinkite balance because the real addresses (with bitcoins on it) are multisig addresses built on the Ledger tree and trees of other cosigners.
@_date: 2015-09-22 17:15:48
Nope, because signing a transaction with the Unplugged requires the possession of a security card acting as a second factor. The videos on our Ledger Unplugged page demonstrate the exact flow if you are curious.

Yes, you need these three elements (PIN, NFC card and security card) to sign/confirm a transaction.
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:04:57
If this is true then it means that all the software stack and APIs they are bundling in their Bitcoin computer is closed source. Which is not a good news in terms of inter operability and app development.

We have ordered two units. They announced shipping will start on September 21th
@_date: 2015-09-27 09:29:05
Hardware wallets from Ledger embed a secure element which purpose is to protect secrets such as private key. Private keys from Ledger products cannot be ever extracted, even if you know the PIN code.
Transactions are verified and signed inside the secure element, this is why you never need to access these private keys outside.
Regarding transaction history, they exist in the blockchain and are not stored inside the hardware wallet. If you are referring to public keys, addresses or extended public keys, they can be exported with the physical possession of the hardware wallet and the knowledge of the PIN code (after three wrong PIN, the chip will wipe out itself).

@_date: 2015-11-17 20:56:21
Trezor is open source, I meant that the Blue was open source compared to our other products (my bad).
Trezor is built on a regular microcontroller unit, and this has some [technical consequences]( This doesn't mean that Trezor is not a good choice, it's just a different architectural approach.
It is important to have a screen because you need to fully validate a transaction, and to be future proof you need to show a lot of information for digital assets (colored coin). We could have done a smaller device, but that small anyway; and if you compare to Trezor or Keepkey, it's bigger but doesn't fundamentally change the fact that you still need to carry something.

Most probably, only the design of the casing which will obviously have a better look &amp; feel. The board may evolve, and some components change, but it won't generate any major change to the Blue itself (for instance, you may benefit a slightly optimized battery consumption or stuff like that).

Unless you are a security expert or want to dedicate an airgapped (offline) machine for your bitcoins, you should only consider using hardware wallets.
Why? Because private keys are critical information and storing them on a general purpose computer will eventually lead to compromission or total loss of the funds.
A hardware wallet manage these keys in a secure stronghold, never revealing them to the host computer. The signature is done out of reach of any malware, and a second factor gives you the opportunity to verify each transaction before authorizing their release on the network.
As the CEO of Ledger, I of course recommend the [Ledger Nano]( but you can also consider Trezor or KeepKey.

More precisely our target price is under $100. Since our early prototypes we've added more features such as double CPU to be able to load open source code.
$50 may be very difficult to achieve, as we may obviously run into some bumps regarding the bill of material and production process.

A few answers about why smart cards matters in this article from our blog: 
@_date: 2015-11-17 21:28:18
Yes that is correct, with the exception that it's not specialized financial security hardware, but a virtualized (general purpose) secure element running in the trusted zone of phone's microprocessor. The secure zone runs in isolation from the normal zone, with direct hardware access to the display, preventing any tampering from a malware.

Attestation is based on cryptographic challenge signature. The private key is inside the secure element of the hardware wallet and therefore extremely difficult and costly to extract.

We have been reviewing your case with engineering, I'm sorry we couldn't come to you earlier on the support.
If the long press on the button doesn't hard reboot the device, it will ultimately empty its battery and will reboot after a full recharge. Did you have the opportunity to try that?

Everything will be deterministically derived from a BIP39 seed. This means the Bitcoin HD wallet (BIP32) but also all FIDO (authentication) and other keys. It'll then fully compatible with other Ledger products and Trezor for the backup/restore.


We plan to guarante it for life: if your battery if dead, we'll replace it for free (shipping not included). In any case, everything in the Blue has been designed to be easily replaced without the need to break anything. I don't have the exact reference with me right now. I'll update later.


Yes. You'll be able to power it off from the setttings.
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:47:24
We are using WebRTC communication so it is decentralized. However if Ledger disappears the Chrome app won't be running correctly as our API to query the blockchain would be probably down. It is not (yet) a SPV client.
Fortunately, your bitcoins are not at risks. You'd be able to recover access from your BIP39 backup to any compatible wallet (Multibit, Mycelium, Trezor...).
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:28:47
They have different architecture, hardware features and also pricing. There is of course more convenience and better accessibility for the Blue, and there is less trade-off from the security point of view, such as a full initialization on the device.

At La Maison du Bitcoin, we are operating an exchange counter where people buy and sell bitcoins against euros (cash or payment cards). The VAT question is something we have solved a few months ago by sending a letter to the fiscal authorities (they have to answer). The EU VAT ruling was then not a surprise, and we of course rejoice that it has been made official at the European level.
Michel Sapin (Minister of Finance) announced today the financial counter terrorism measures which will be taken in the coming weeks. None are related to cryptocurrencies (which are not at all mentionned), the takedown is targetted on anonymous VISA and Mastercard payment cards, as well as cash.
The Bitcoin scene is not extremely active in France; we have a lot of engineers and enthousiasts, but the usage in shops (both online and physical) is quite poor. We have everyday a few dozen of people entering our Bitcoin space, buying bitcoins or asking for informations. Most of them are using the currency to play online (poker, betting, ...) and a few to invest/HODL.

Yes. The private keys are protected in the secure element of the hardware wallet and will never reveal them to the host computer.
The Ledger Wallet Chrome app is open source and is just an "interface" to your wallet. When you want to send a payment, the HW will push your smartphone so you'll be able to verify the amount and destination address. Thus, even if the Chrome app is compromized, you'll be able to counter the attack.
Here is a video showing the process:

Just a few pointers about the difference between the Ledger Blue and the Trezor:
- like all Ledger products the Blue is architectured around a secure element (here a ST31) 
- the Blue has BLE and NFC in addition of the USB
- the Blue has a huge touch color screen
- generally speaking the Blue is more a personal privacy device than a hardware wallet, featuring FIDO authentication (U2F, UAF), and other third party integration such as encryption and signature.
- the Blue is open source and will feature a full SDK
@_date: 2016-05-11 14:26:15
This pretty much apply to anything
@_date: 2015-03-04 11:03:07
Yes it is BIP32/39/44 compatible (without passphrase support). So any 24 words seed could be restored from a Trezor to a Ledger (and vice versa)
@_date: 2015-11-17 21:18:45
It's in fact already integrated in a mobile phone with the Ledger Trustlett, leveraging the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) of high end Samsung's phones. We are in beta right now with Mycelium, have a look here:  
We plan to have common SDK/API between the Blue and the TEE, so the two options will be completely interoperable.

Best practices require to store all KYC information encrypted, and to use smartcards for client side decryption.

Sorry I meant Trezor, not Ledger, in my sentence (it was late).
Did you ever use a Nano or HW.1? Or did you at least checked a video of how it is used? Because they are securely paired to a smartphone acting as a trusted display, so the user can verify what's being signed, exactly like on the Trezor.
So your attack vector is not valid at all.

Depends of your country and bank of the issuer, but if it's EURO/SEPA then 
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:25:29
This could work, but at the first initialization the user need to be in a secure environment to backup the seed, so the problem would still be here. This is the biggest weakness of our product compared to a screen enabled hardware wallet, which can be mitigated using an airgap computer (a ChromeOS USB bootable USB key, as explained in our guide)
@_date: 2015-10-17 14:48:47
For "man with a gun" the best solution if multi signature with a co signer outside of your immediate control (like a 72 hours delay signature oracle).
Trezor offers plausible deniability with their passphrase feature (just have two passphrases, one for the real account, one for the fake one).
However, if someone takes the risk of abduct you or physically assault you, there is a great chance that the attacker knows about your bitcoins and won't stop hitting you until you give up the real passphrase.
@_date: 2016-05-18 19:38:44
*"I think Trezor is secure by its design and there's not too much space for improvements. Not talking about that 'secure element' thingy, which solves what's not a problem and is full of proprietary stuff.*
 Marek Palatinus, Satoshi Labs, CTO
*"Given these developments, we, as a product company, have taken a clear stand against implementations based on off-the-shelf components and further believe that something like a commercial-grade AVR or ARM controller is unfit to be used in a security product. In most cases, these controllers are easy to attack, from breaking in via a debug/JTAG/TAP port to probing memory contents. Various forms of fault injection and side-channel analysis are possible, sometimes allowing for a complete key recovery in a shockingly short period of time."*

Why? Because private keys are critical information and storing them on a general purpose computer will eventually lead to compromission or total loss of the funds. Having your keys on a USB drive doesn't change the fact that at some time your private keys will be in the memory of your computer.

I can't see how your scenario doesn't apply also to Trezor or any hardware wallet designer. If you want a full trustless solution, mitigating government attacks, use multisignature with a mix of  different hardware wallets products. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:01:35
You have two scenarios here:
* the destination address has been changed from the start (for instance on the payment page of the webpage), then screen or not, security card or not, you are screwed (solution is BIP70)
* you do know the correct address but the malware change it before asking the hardware wallet to sign it. The security card or mobile challenge will show you the tampered payment address, so you will see it has been changed

Ledger uses a second factor to verify and validate all outgoing transactions (through a push on your smartphone, or using a security card) . So even if your PIN is compromized, the malware wouldn't be able to sign a transaction.

**Ledger** uses BIP39.
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:01:59
It is compatible with HW1 yes. 
User validation is performed as follows :
* A specific status is returned to inform the user that a validation is pending. This request includes an encrypted summary of the transaction and a nonce. The symmetric encryption keys are shared when the Ledger Wallet and the remote device are paired. A Security Card challenge is requested to pair the remote device
* The user verifies the transaction summary on the remote device
* The remote device generates a signed version of the nonce which is sent to the Ledger Wallet to confirm user validation

@_date: 2015-11-05 08:44:42
It wouldn't change a lot from an IT security point of view. The benefit of having more than one HW is that you can mitigate your physical security (assault, kidnapping...) by having your coins spread in different places. But the more HW you have, the more seeds you need to protect (the seed is the 24 words you have to keep safe, so you can restore your bitcoins in case of loss of your physical HW).
You can also consider multisignature with Coinkite or Copay (using Ledger's hardware wallets).

The latest firmware is in beta and we hope to release before the end of the year. It's quite slow because we are dealing with a lot of projects and it also requires to change completely our onboarding and the UX takes time to be fine tuned.


The Ledger HW.1 is a good candidate for a sub $5 hardware wallet. It is *only* a question of quantity and size of the market. If we were to build and deliver 500,000+ units we wouldn't have a problem to target this price.


We have met their team a few time and are currently working together on one of their project. It's not up to me to tell more so I can't get in the specifics.
We believe in open standards and decentralization so we are certainly in favor of integrate our products to the maximum number of third party applications (by opposition to force our customers to use our Chrome app only). For instance, Mycelium is always seeing the first beta of all our products, like the TEE or Ledger Blue.
@_date: 2015-10-07 06:05:26
Our team will look at it now. We may indeed have introduced a bug in the tx filtering but it'll be hopefully fixed soon. 
Can you check the link for your screenshot it doesn't look correct. 
Also could you send a message to the support from the Chrome app? It'll attach necessary logs to help us debug. Thanks 
@_date: 2015-10-19 11:29:01
Yes, correct.
To be able to spend the bitcoins, you need to have these three elements in the same time:
- the Ledger Nano (the device)
- the PIN
- the smartphone (or the security card)
@_date: 2015-10-22 07:06:13
Yes, but I can't go in the specifics about this particular case. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 16:44:42
The Ledger hardware wallets do not rely on our websites to operate. It is true for the Ledger Wallet Chrome app (which requires access to our API), but you can use the Nano with a multitude of third party wallets which are not at all related to Ledger.
Moreover, you always have your 24 words seed which can be used to restore access to your bitcoins in any BIP39 (it's an open standard) wallet. So even if Ledger goes out of business, you'll never lose access to your bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:49:45
The Trusted UI (the 8bits looking UI) cannot be compromised by design, as it is directly connected to the secure enclave. You can't run a MITM attack on this kind of setup. This is all the point of running mission critical operations inside the TEE.
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:43:42
Use a HD wallet with a BIP39 seed backup on a paper. Put the backup in a safe with your will.
The benefit is that you can still use your bitcoins and do not have to update your backup when you create new addresses. I recommend using a hardware wallet to protect your master seed and avoid any hacking possibility when transacting with your wallet.
You can use a [Ledger]( or a [Trezor](
If you buy a Ledger Nano Duo, you will have two hardware wallets cloned to the same seed. You can have one with you, and one in the safe (with the backup), for an easy and immediate recovery.
Many things can change in 14 years, but a BIP39 seed will  always be a source to derive your private keys following the BIP32 and BIP44 standards.

I'm right now in Vegas for Money2020 so I'm not aware of the specifics, but it looks like one of our engineer decided to send an email to all users affected by a benigne notification bug.
I don't have all the details, but by probably putting everyone in cc instead of bcc, this engineer breached confidentiality and resulted in a massive fuckup. 
This is extremely embarrassing, and we take full responsability. I'll have more information in a few hours.
EDIT: so yes, the email was sent manually by one engineer who wanted to do good but made a huge mistake in the destination fields. About 100 persons were affected by this issue. This won't of course ever repeat again as we have banned this kind of unsupervised initiative.

This is the first working technical demonstration of a virtualized hardware wallet running in a Trusted Execution Environment (Secure Enclave on Android that cannot be attacked by malware) - we expect to go commercial in March; it's based on the existing Ledger API (easy to integrate for wallet developers - see our [GreenBits fork]( and we plan to offer Open Source extensions in a short time.

If the address is swapped on the browser, then even the screen from the TREZOR wouldn't help, because you would validate the transaction to what you think is the correct address.
One of the solution to this particular attack is to use BIP70 payment protocol.

Firmware is closed source yes, as we cannot reveal the secure element APIs (NDA). However, we do have very [detailed specifications]( documenting exactly how the chip is supposed to behave.
If you are ready to read all the source code of TREZOR, then you can also be ready to write test vectors checking the Ledger against its own specifications.
This is called certification, and this is how security has been designed for decades.
Naturally, you may prefer inspect the source, and this is why community projects such as TREZOR exist. But stating "closed source" without further explanation could look like you would imply such architecture as less secure or less interesting. Which would be technically inexact.
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:34:27
The Ledger Wallet, as the TREZOR, is decentralized. It's mean that even if Ledger goes bust, you will still be able to recover access to your bitcoins using the recovery sheet containing a backup of your seed (24 words).
This means that you will need to keep secure this sheet, exactly like you would with a paper wallet. The bonus of having also a hardware wallet is that you can use/spend your bitcoins easily and securely.

When OB is going to scale, trusted hardware will be mandatory to run a node.
I didn't look at the code, but is the GUID management isolated in specific libraries so hardware wallets vendors could work on an integration without heavy refactoring of the code base?

Full documentation and specifications of firmware 1.0.0 is available here:
User validation is performed as follows :
* A specific status is returned to inform the user that a validation is pending. This request includes an encrypted summary of the transaction and a nonce. The symmetric encryption keys are shared when the Ledger Wallet and the remote device are paired. A Security Card challenge is requested to pair the remote device
* The user verifies the transaction summary on the remote device
* The remote device generates a signed version of the nonce which is sent to the Ledger Wallet to confirm user validation

We run a Bitcoin service in France (La Maison du Bitcoin) where we accept credit card payments. You have no idea about the level of sophistication scammers are achieving in order to manage to bypass our KYC!
To open an account remotely, we require identification papers and proof of residence. 
But of course, we started to receive stolen IDs from unsuspecting people and we decided to ask for a land line phone bill so we could call them.
What did they do? They bought local skype numbers and faked phone bills.
Then we decided to ask for selfie, so we could be sure we were in contact with the real person. You think it would be enough to stop scammers? Well, no!
They went to a new level.
They published false job positions offers in some parts of France where people are desesperate to get a job. Basically a receptionnist position in a hotel. Then they tell job applicants they will be paid using some kind of new electronic money, and that the first step of the process would be to open an account on our service (using a webmail they provide, on which they control the passwords).
So we started to receive strange requests of account opening from people who didn't seem to have clue about what Bitcoin is. By doing some enquiries, we discovered the scam and had to contact the national job agency to have them remove the false offers!
But you'll ask, WHY do they go such length to buy bitcoins with credit cards? Not because they want to clear stolen cards, but because they have organized crime rings stealing (other) IDs and opening accounts in small bank branches. Then they proceed to contract instant consumer credits (something like 3000 EUR), and they can only pay using virtual credit cards (no cash withdraw).
These virtual cards are not stolen, are verified 3D secure, and only months after the accounts has been emptied banks wake up and start crying fool. Then the police comes, see that all the money has been processed by a small Bitcoin service, and guess who's the primary suspect for this massive scam? Well, us.
That's why all bitcoin services have (or should have) crazy customer verifications, so they can protect their own ass.

The Ledger Chrome app doesn't implement coin control features (i.e. manually selecting the inputs for a tx). If this would become a popular request, we could add it to our roadmap.
However, you can create multiple accounts and segregate balances. So you can have multiple trees of addresses which are not linked at all. This feature should be enough for mostly all cases.

These hardware wallets are HD wallet. It means that they are based on a 256 bits entropy seed which would be the only thing you'll ever need to backup.
All addresses are deterministically derived from this seed, so you have access to a virtually infinite number of private keys. All this without the need of updating your backup/paper wallet. This is why such setup is vastly superior than a simple paper wallet.

Hearing you dismissing secure chip technology as a "thingy" is like hearing Professor Mark Williams dimissing Bitcoin as tulip mania. 
You may think that no one will ever build hacking devices extracting private keys from unsuspecting TREZOR owners or run interceptions on your supply chain, but just I don't get why you would not want the added level of protection of a secure chip.
@_date: 2016-07-01 06:21:57
nope, because there is not battery on the device.

Yes, you should follow  for updates. If you can wait, then it will be easier to start directly with the firmware update and then the activation.

Ledger has of course also a second factor confirmation allowing to check what the chip is signing:
* solve a challenge based on a unique security card and the destination address (see  for a demo, at 2:25)
* pair a smartphone (once, using the security card), and you confirm/reject on your mobile with a full visual confirmation of the transaction (see 
The second method will be available with the next firmware release, in the coming weeks.

Ledger's CEO here.
Once you have wiped your HW.1 by entering three wrong PINs in a row, it'll go back to factory settings and you'll be able to give it without any security risk.
As you'll have to also give the security card, you may decided to [generate a new one]( and pair it to the HW.1 by flashing the firmware again.
Ledger is using cryptographic attestation to make sure that devices are genuine. You can see more about how this feature works on our [blog article](

What is keeping a hardware manufacturer honest? From a pragmatic perspective, it's mainly about putting in balance pros and cons of doing an exit scam. On one side, it's about building a long lasting business generating sizeable revenues, on the other one, it's about running for life from the police while embezzling crypto funds that can easily be traced on the blockchain. That's why the reputation of a manufacturer is a major selling point.
From a consumer perspective, there are two possible approaches you can take to get more guarantees about the genuineness of your hardware wallet:
* if it's open source, then you can compile/verify everything yourself and flash using command tools (blindly installing the firmware is not enough, being open source doesn't mean that the binary you are downloading is what you are expecting to be). You must also be sure you sourced the hardware directly from the manufacturer as there are no possibility to attest that what you have in your hands is not a [fake one](
* if it's based on a secure chip (and therefore closed source at the level of the firmware), then you can rely on a cryptographic chain of trust. The Ledger Nano S / X devices can [demonstrate their genuineness]( and the secure chip ensures that only official Ledger firmware can be installed. And the Ledger firmware has been [certified by a third party security auditor]( (Thales) regarding its major security claims (including the entropy of the random generator).
At the end of the day, the reputation of the manufacturer added to the auditability of the device (either by yourself or by a trusted third party) give you a strong guarantee about the fact that your crypto will stay safe.
As Ledger co-founder and main shareholder, I have hundreds of millions of dollars of potential upside tied to the success of the company. And this applies, in various relative size, to other co-founders and key people of Ledger. I'm quite a public person in France, easy to find, and I have kids. Executing an exit scam and run for my life would be the most stupid and brainless decision anyone in my shoes could take... I have all incentives to make sure that we provide with the best possible security solutions for our customers, and to put in place all possible processes to prevent any kind of internal back doors or employee theft / hack.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:47:22
Firmware upgrade signatures (which would be the only attack vector) are based on a multi authorization scheme. It requires three high ranking Ledger officers (from different divisions) to execute a signature in the HSM delivering production firmwares.

When you use a hardware wallet ([Ledger]( or TREZOR), the benefit is that you get both a paper wallet and a hot wallet in the same time. Paper wallet because you still need to secure your backup on a physical piece of paper, and hot wallet because you can actually use the bitcoins from the wallet without risking at all their security.
A paper wallet is safe until the moment you need to use it, notwithstanding all the complexity of using only a part and sending the remaining money back to a new change address etc.
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:34:53
It looks like this is an issue related to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS where the USB drivers are broken. We've had other customers having the same issue, and so far we do not have a patch.
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:55:03
You could say the same for any kind of hardware wallet: you can lose them, drop them, break them, etc. 
This is why you always use a paper backup of your BIP39 seed, secured in a safe location.

This is a complex subject and I'd like to chime in with my industry experience on the matter. I'm the CEO of Ledger, makers of hardware wallets, and also founder of "La Maison du Bitcoin" (House of Bitcoin) a Bitcoin exchange counter also operating online.
- Ledger is selling hardware wallets, often used with our Ledger Wallet Bitcoin (or Ethereum) Chrome application. Everything has been designed in our processes to maximize privacy, and absolutely no KYC is done at any level. This is a 100% Bitcoin business, and there is not one ounce of regulation.
- La Maison du Bitcoin is operating a Bitcoin broker, where people can buy bitcoins with credit cards. For this specific activity we have a very thorough KYC, where we asks for passport, selfie of you holding a passport and a proof of address. In some cases, we even phone you and asks you very strange questions like the color of your house door to verify your identity. Why do we do that? First, to protect ourselves against credit card fraud, identity theft and all sorts of scams (where the victims are the ones who got their identity stolen). Second, to comply with the occasional police investigation where identity of a buyer is requested upon a judge's order. In 99% of the cases, it's related to scams or thefts, and not to drug trade. We do this painful KYC to be able to operate the service. Any other approach would result in total failure.
I understand that people may be opposed to KYC on the principles that it violates your privacy. But there is no way to expect a fiat / crypto service without these constraints. Or if you find one service applying the YOLO principles, you'll quickly see it disappear in flames, consumed by its own mismanagement.
At Ledger, we believe in the empowerment that Bitcoin gives to everyone, where you are your own bank, in control. But in the same time we are also conscious of the basic rules to operate a fiat based business. 
As long as we keep the frontier clear, and that we do not try to apply crypto principles to fiat (and the opposite), we can live in full harmony.

Then it won't pass cryptographic attestation and you'll know it's a counterfeit.

Ledger's firmware integrity is protected by cryptographic attestation (ensure by the secure chip), so it's not possible to counterfeit them.
