Is it just the % that makes you anxious? I'm at [10% but that's ~10 hours](

I've been using [Purse]( with the "Name Your Discount" feature (pairs with Amazon wishlist) with pretty good results.
Add the [eyepiece]( to your wishlist (make sure to follow steps to make it public) and try it out!
Edit: Also, you can buy products on Overstock.com and games on Steam.

Surely that means that the "more than 98%" in offline storage is not covered by the policy then, right?

My largest purchase was the 2nd.  It definitely sucks to be on the "losing" side of things at the moment, especially because the main reason I bought is I missed every previous "big dip."  Well, I definitely didn't miss it, but the universe laughed the moment I clicked "buy" and decided that would be ATH for a while. 
Oh well... told myself I had to be willing to lose it all.  I don't think that will be the case, but it's been a little nerve-racking watching my purchase become worth less and less. At least I have some bitcoin though, as I hope and believe it will be worth it in the long run.

I *think* you're running a full node and everything is okay, based on the 1037.
NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED [1024] ([BIP159]( means the node is capable of providing at least the last 288 blocks.
The number provided is higher (1037) which indicates your node is also signalling NODE_NETWORK [1], NODE_BLOOM [4], and NODE_WITNESS [8] (1 + 4 + 8 + 1024 = 1037).
NODE_NETWORK [1] means the node is capable of providing the entire block chain.
I'm guessing that the node is automatically signalling BIP159 because you're serving the entire chain, which automatically includes the last 288 blocks.
If you had NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED, *without* NODE_NETWORK, it would imply a pruned-node.

You might want to considering doing front/back differently so you could expand on each thing a little. For example, the ability to break down the bitcoin means you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin which beginners should know. Expanding on the device piece you might say bitcoin is stored in a digital *wallet*, to bring a familiar term in. As others mentioned, you could say there is a finite about, but also why that might matter to them. Might include "BTC" somewhere too. Last (very minor formatting thing) is that only one fact has a period at the end - you want to either have one for all or none for any.

My pleasure! Thanks for helping to spread the word!
