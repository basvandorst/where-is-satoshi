Like most conspiracy theories, it **could** be true. But it is about as likely as the invisible pink unicorn.

As a bitcoin noob I'm surrounded by apps and websites that willake me a wallet.
Given that I'm not some kind of math expert, I need **something** to generate a key pair. What do I pick?

Is this a thing? 
I do hope this is a thing.
Edit: can confirm, is thing.

I see the point you are making. I think its unfortunate that you keep inadvertently trivialising gang rape. Which is why I tried to state the issue without mentioning it.

Wow, getting some down vote burn from reddit's elite phonologists there.

Hi Kephalos, 
Would you like to buy some 'high quality' digital media from me, you sound like the perfect customer to get my new money making venture off the ground!

Or two thousand in roman numerals. 
Romans, you know, the people famous for using Latin.
Edit: yes, I realise that's what the finance industry does. But I think most people here tend to agree they're bonkers anyhow.

If he found a solvent company to be stressful there's no way he'd chose an insolvent one instead.

Tax is part of the country you live in just like the process of lawmaking.
If your elected government want to pass a law saying tax is legal, they can. Unfortunately, the approval of everyone is not a prerequisite to a new law.

Surely it isn't good work until someone can verify it?

Whilst undoubtedly remarkable it also completely ignores the value of the mined bit coins which is the reason why people are happy to process transactions for free.
I would imagine the financial system would be capable of processing for free if the treasury printed them money to do so.

That's oddly beautiful.

Actually, no. 
The down vote button was not intended to be a disagree / dislike button - see rediquette.
When it is, it can lead to sub's becoming a stagnant self centered echo chamber where alternate view points tend to be trampled by self reinforcing opinion.

Nah, that's just how wikipedia creates raw fact from the quantum foam of the internet.

RES has that, but if reddit has ever done it as a standard feature it's from before I was here.

Not sure why you are getting down voted, stuffing the ballot box with money would hamper Democratic process.

I think its a symptomatic of a couple of issues with reddit: it only takes a single downvote to bury a comment or post, no one understands rediqutte any more and reddit is highly prone to herd mentality.
IMHO, reddit should not show the vote score for comments at all (just use it for sorting) as the vote score seems to prime future viewers on how they should feel. As for what to do about the single downvote = bury, I'm not so sure.

I don't think that qualifies for nsfl. It does picture well preserved dead bodies, but they knew the risks. Reading it is to be recommended for people interested in the subject at hand.

What you are talking about is not a business, it is criminal activity.

Suggesting that money laundering is victimless is specious reasoning. At its simplest money laundering is just hiding evidence, which should not be analysed without considering what the evidence was of.
Claiming that because you can't identify the victim means that there is no crime is not the same as there not being a victim. The money could be being laundered because its for the sale of a baggie of weed, in which case I would agree: no victim. It could, however, be for burying drums of hexavalent chromium by the school well, in which case claiming no victim would be nothing more than wilful ignorance.
