I think this project will need to focus a lot on structure in order to really pull of the "crowdsourcing" aspect well.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:14:46
My concerns is if it is crowdsourced then we might get too much "CRAP" content with only a few gems. Which would leave the people who created the "CRAP" with low morale to contribute something they might have of value in the future. Unless we come up with more of a "democratic election process" for lack of a better term, the people at large that are part of  "Voice of Bitcoin" are the ones who elect certain members to certain positions and/or remove them at the the will of the community.

I don't agree that public approval and the chances of something getting passed should be so closely tied like on the black line on this graph. Simply just because the public is largely uninformed and are not experts in law or science generally speaking. 
However that said the popularity should have a medium influence on the policies and should be reversed with the line that the elite have.
And he never did mention who the "elite" were in terms of income. Technically I'm actually in the top 1% income earners globally but that's only a middle class for here in Canada. In fact if I owned a car I would only be able to save about 5-10% of my income.

BTC or USD?
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:12:10


They can and do tax it currently. Same with my country Canada and several others, it's currently under capital gains tax here.


Why? Governments regulate markets all the time including the stock exchanges which people make order of magnitudes more money off of than bitcoin. 
The thing about bitcoin is that no one can really stop you [except physically of course] from transacting with bitcoin. However, despite the common belief, it is very hard to be anonymous with bitcoin. So the government will probably find out if you're cheating on your taxes and put you in prison for it just like they do now if they figure out you were money laundering  with physical fiat cash.
But all that aside, even if the US does ban cryptocurrency, they will be shooting themselves in the foot. The blockchain will continue to thrive in other parts of the world just fine with or without the US. That's the beauty of decentralized digital cash/gold backed by math, not government.

She apparently hasn't even bothered to [read the wikipage, Bitcoin was introduced on 31 October 2008 to a cryptography mailing list]( Unless she considers people like the late Hal Finney to "BIG BAD GUYS on the dark web". That statement alone is incredibly disrespectful to him and his family. Normally I wouldn't care but she is an economist, I mean it's literally her job to report the facts and build predictions based on those facts.


She is sort of right here, cause I think she is almost saying bitcoin isn't  a great currency because it acts like a commodity. But if she bothered to read the white paper she would also know that this is a plan from day 1. Commodity first and then currency.
But then she said this on her twitter,


Huh? Who said all of society is gonna switch to bitcoin? Or that we will ever reach the limit for that matter.
But the final thing that shows she doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about is this


I've always had respect for academics and stay clear of conspiracy theories, but I'm serious starting to think they are all full of shit. I mean if she even spent like 3 or 4 hours reading up on Bitcoin I'm sure she wouldn't have said half that stuff.

current price ≈1000$
If approved: 5000$-1000$ = ≈400% profit
Chances of approval: 15% * 400% = 6000% profit
Rejection: 85% * -30% = -2550% profit
6000% - 2550% = 3450%
So a simple risk analysis says that if you played these odds a few hundred times it would definitely be worth it to bet for the ETF approval every time. You would most likely end the game with ≈3450% profit if you played 100 times. The risk vs return is minuscule.

No, for several reasons.
* Bitcoin is global so even in a worst case scenario it would only hurt the price of bitcoin, it will definitely still exist because the rest of the world can still use it just fine.
* The US government isn't completely retarded, outright banning bitcoin could be a huge missed business opportunity in the order of billions or maybe even trillions of dollars in the long term.
* People still do illegal things all the time, and bitcoin is basically impossible to stop if you allow your citizens to have an internet connection. That's kind of the point of bitcoin.

I disagree with u/Big_Theta . Because it's not just about "the homeless" per say. There are many different versions of UBI but the main reason why it works better is because it gets rid of the expensive bureaucracy created by social programs, whilst allowing the free markets to do the rest.
In my city there is around 1.2m people but only about 2,000-4,000 homeless at any given point in time. And a very large percentage of those people have mental health or physical/mental disabilities. And a lot of them already get some kind of payments from the government.
That said about 120,000 people in my city are living in poverty and from recent polls 1 in 5 people are worried about having enough money for food. And I think that this is the group of people that UBI is supposed to help the most. It's supposed to diminish the effects poverty in a much more efficient way than the current program. For example you could completely do away with government food banks because everyone could simply go to the grocery store. Also people are more likely to afford higher education which also reduces the effects of poverty.
It's not about helping the 1-2% of people that are homeless but more about poverty in general. Increasing the social mobility the 10-15% and creating a safety net for the middle class.
Another reason for UBI is AI automation by that's another topic.
Disclaimer: I think that UBI needs to be researched a lot more before we change anything on a massive scale. So I'm not necessarily a proponent ... yet.

Yes, it is. Bitcoin has the highest market cap, has been around the longest and has the most users and traders. And some would argue it's more decentralized than all the others too.
If you think ETH has gone up 5x in a few weeks and isn't in a massive bubble and it's somehow a sign of a healthy market think again. Not that you couldn't profit off of ETH. But if you plan on storing your money longterm you don't want crazy bubbles generally.

It's like the difference between owning a car or paying for a taxi, if he wants to pay double the rate for his taxi let him.
If Bitcoin can't handle a **millionaire**  throwing some cash at it, even to purposely destroy it, it will never survive the long term and the system is flawed. 
Governments will be able to launch attacks against Bitcoin orders of magnitude more sophisticated  than what roger ver ever could. At least once they figure out what it is.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:58:44
Unfortunately that is the most likely scenario IMO. Intentionally or unintentionally the price is probably going to crash hard because it looks as if there is no resolution coming anytime soon. 
To me this isn't just bad for bitcoin, but all cryptocurrency.
Either there is no real solution for scaling and/or bitcoins consensus mechanisms are broken. 
**OR** Bitcoin has suffered some sort of sophisticated attack by some powerful actors via politics. Like perhaps the Chinese government? That's just complete speculation though. But if it was the case that means cryptocurrency might not work at all if all it takes is a few powerful actors paying some shills to destroy it.

As an amateur developer  myself, it's pretty scary to think that I could add 25% more brain power to team that's responsible for 20 billion dollars just by joining. 4 core devs is pretty small for any software team.
Blender 3D, another open source project has about 22 core developers. And it has a shit ton of bugs as great as it is. Which is normal for most software however EXTREME care should be taken when developing something that secures billions of dollars. If you only have 4 devs you barely have time to even write the code let alone make sure there isn't any lethal bugs.
Even if they were alstar developers having a team that small is EXTREMELY reckless IMO for a protocol with that much money at stake. This isn't some angry bird on the App Store, it's billions of dollars.

How do you know there wasn't investors waiting to put money down if it got approved? I would say there almost certainly was.


So it could only go up as much as it would go down? I'm not sure what your trying to say. The market cap could have doubled sometime after COIN started trading. 
But it didn't so the growth trend that we've been seeing for the past 8 months will probably continue instead of a straight moonshot.

As a hobbyist programmer, you and OP just confirmed all my suspicions about poor code quality in BU. 
There is people in r/btc that actually think having two bugs crashing their nodes in a matter of a few weeks is actually acceptable for a project like bitcoin "All code has bugs" is what I've read as justification. Apparently the bugs were only 6 lines of code apart. So you could practically see the second bug in your code editor while fixing the first one.  
It truly boggles my mind that people think the BU team is anywhere near as good as the BC team.

But if you watch the debate with him and Johnny from Core, he basically looks like a political pundit fueled by libertarian and anarchist ideologies as opposed to an engineer or economist. Which is not a good thing because scaling is a technical, not a philosophical debate.
I don't know whose right because I don't have the expertise, but I would say it's clear that not only is Ver untrustworthy but he also doesn't understand the system he is trying to change, or as much as he wants people to believe.

Satoshi believed that bitcoin would be more of a commodity at first and that's what would give it value but as time went on it and adoption increased and the infrastructure grew that it would become a robust payment network/currency with an increasingly stable price.

I'd say that's actually about right, from my experience as a middle class Canadian at least.
Although, that's only people who have heard of the term "Bitcoin" not people who actually understand how it works. Or anything about it. Every single person I've met IRL who knows about bitcoin doesn't understand the difference between bitcoin, linden dollars, or WOW gold. Except one software developer who worked at a company that was spuriously involved with bitcoin somehow. And even he didn't seem to have a really good grasp and assumed that it was only for money launderers. 
One of my coworkers who "knew" what bitcoin was said something to the effect of "Oh, your talking about bitcoin? You mean that failed currency? they're even giving it away for free down by (some place)" as he chuckled about how stupid bitcoin was.
I lol-ed so hard and then just walked away. So yes that's the extent of the average persons knowledge.
This is why I'm so bullish about bitcoin, because even "experts" don't even understand it.

Um... So the same set of people doing the same thing with bitcoin over the years , all decided to increase their **DAILY** transactions at a [seemingly exponential rate]( that also happens to mimic exactly what you'd expect to see from natural network growth?

My 15 year old brother told me about bitcoin when it was around 13$. He explained mining as best as he could. I told him it probably wouldn't be worth it because it sounded like a ponzi scheme and it didn't make sense. It must of been a scam. Later I came across an article when it was around 100$ and understood it a lot better and tried to buy some but it was nearly impossible at the time.
**TL;DR** if I wasn't an ignorant twat to my brother I could have been a millionaire.
He didn't end up getting any bitcoin either because mining was above his technical expertise and he didn't have the money to buy any.
@_date: 2016-11-26 23:08:24
Yes, and if you believe in [network effects]( we have some evidence that it was a ridiculous speculative bubble. However the value now is much closer to what the value of the network actually should be based on the number of users (which is estimated by daily transaction volume)
If you look at the daily market cap vs transaction volume on [this scatter plot]( one could infer that the huge and sharp peak on the left, 2013 ATH, was because of speculation. It deviated very far from the red line. Whereas now transaction volume and market cap are much closer to the red line. Meaning the bitcoin networks value is now pretty close to where it should be given the number of actual users/transactions.
This makes me pretty bullish because it means bitcoin is actually being used more and more for value transfer and is clearly finding some use cases. Maybe even at an [exponential rate]( and that the current value isn't held up by insane amounts speculation, but an actual bitcoin economy to some degree. And a network effect is making it increase at a faster and faster pace.
My biggest fear for bitcoin right now is that it won't be able scale at a rate fast enough for the apparent exponential rise of the transaction volume.

Like you'd think they would spend a couple hours researching Bitcoin or hire a computer scientist to give them a run down on the specific challenges with the technology.
This is why I think Bitcoin might turn out to be a huge deal, because just like with computers in the 70s and 80s, 99% of people had no idea what they were capable of so a lot of people dismissed it out right. In the same way both regular people and politicians Don't have the slightest clue of what Bitcoin can do today. Even in its current condition, not even taking into account the future software improvements.

Don't get me wrong, I'm bullish for Bitcoin but there has always been options to not use banks. The options mostly involve keeping your wealth physically. Which is a bad idea if all it takes is someone with bad intentions and gun to steal your life savings. That's very inescure solution for most people. Banks to provide some level of security and I think that they will probably always exist.

It's a bit more complicated than that because no one knows how many coins have been lost.
The market cap is simply (number of total coins ever mined) * (market price per Bitcoin)
The issue is that the market has no idea how many coins have been lost forever. The other thing is that it's possible only a very small percentage of people who own bitcoin are actually willing to sell it which leaves a small pool of liquidity that can be bought up.
For example if I had 1 million dollars to invest in bitcoin, but at the time there was only 0.5 million dollars actually available on all the exchanges in the world (at the time) then for a brief period of time it would cause a spike in the price because of everyone trying to out bid each other for bitcoin on the exchange, until there was more liquidity again. The jump in price could be more than 1x10 million dollars to the market cap even though I didn't actually put that much money into bitcoin. It all depends on how many bitcoins have been mined, which is different than supply, and the actual supply vs demand.
**TL;DR** : No it probably doesn't mean 2 billion dollars in the past week. My guess is it's closer to maybe a 100 millionish or under 1 billion. But I'm just pulling that out of my ass.

To be fair, there is far more easily accessible information about bitcoin now than ever. Also the technology and the network prove themselves more the longer they run. Bitcoin is more secure than ever. At this point it's biggest weakness appears to be politics.
Lastly, I remember being interested enough to try and buy $100 worth of bitcoin back when it was around $60 a coin. I didn't end up buying any because it was extremely difficult to buy at the time. There was almost no services that let you buy in Canada, that weren't sketchy at least. And I also didn't know nearly as much as I know now so it's not surprising to me that people want to buy now instead of earlier.
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:07:32
Yes that's possible, or it means just like in 2013 it's over valued and in a bubble, just not nearly as big. Even if it is slightly over valued it won't be for long because the speed at which the price moves upward along the red line will increase exponentially if the current trends continue. That is; daily transaction volume [appears to be increasing exponentially]( . I'm guessing this growth is pretty much network effects in action and it could be awhile before it ever slows down.
So even if this bubble pops it would be something like 100$ drop in price for a few months and then it would continue it's upward trend. Or maybe the price will stagnate for a few months until transaction volume catches up. Who knows.

My whole thing for not caring about this is because it's really hard to change language intentionally. It's basically a useless task to force a language change. Eventually when the time comes, and the middle class person makes less than a Bitcoin a year, some slang or terms will naturally develop to name a small portions of of BTC. And it will probably even very regionally. Like "bucks", "dollars", and "loonies".
So yes who cares, I don't believe for a second that the naming of the divisions of Bitcoin will be a serious barrier to adoption.

Go look at the [transactions per day]( dude. Hard to imagine that transactions are increasing **without** people finding more use cases and/or more people getting into the bitcoin space. I mean most transactions are not free so there is some economic incentive for these people to be utilizing the network clearly.

@_date: 2016-11-04 19:33:26
Well that is just one reason it's better. But just because the government is bad at one thing doesn't mean it's bad at all things.
Aside from the government potentially choosing to devalue their currency via inflation or through bad political decisions, well intentioned or not, local currencies/economies can straight up crash for purely economic reasons that have little to do with governments. So an example would be that in Canada in the past 2 years the dollar has dropped 20% on top of inflation vs USD. This mostly had to do with oil prices than anything. But I see no reason why my personal savings should loose so much value over something I have no control over. Where as with Bitcoin my local economy has virtually no impact on my savings because of its global and decentralized nature. And in some ways it's better for my country because I'm keeping wealth within the borders.

**R2 = 0.7412 from 2010 until now**

That said, the market cap is a better indicator for the size or healthiness of the ecosystem than the market price. **IMO**
The reason for that is because of situations like right now; the market cap is at an all time high, which argueably means there is more money than ever in bitcoin, whilst the market price is not. And we were recently at 8% inflation and now we are at around 4%, which is still pretty high for some countries and least.
@_date: 2016-11-24 02:54:41
So I wrote a little script in python to see if there was a correlation between the market cap and number of transactions on each day.
It appears there might be some correlation.
* Fig 1. Is every single day since bitcoin was trading for more than 1 dollar.
* Fig 2. Is every day since Jan 2015, this is to make sure that the huge peak of Fig 1. is not because of network spam or something. I think it basically suggests that bitcoin was actually way over priced in 2013 because of how far it deviated from the expected linear correlation (the red line).
* Fig 3. Is the same as figure 2 except the amount of transactions = transactions ^ 2(divided by 1 mil so it would display properly in pyplot) because according to my understanding of [Metcalfe's law]( there should be a linear correlation here ( I might be wrong though). If my understanding is correct that would suggest bitcoin is actually slightly over priced right now or the number of transactions per day are going to catch up very soon.

Because when my local(or my countries) economy crashes I don't suffer the consequences of having my savings in cash devalued. In the same way buying gold would also protect you from that, which is also why some people call Bitcoin "digital gold".

Just used the ATM! 
My thoughts:
I must have been the first person to use this BTM because when I first put in the bills it took like 20 seconds to process so I thought it ate my money! But after I put in a few more it started to process them in 2-3 seconds.
The price is 6% which is currently the cheapest BTM in Calgary wayyyyy better than the 15% at cafe blanca.  Definitely recommend the BTM on Macleod trail.  This is now cheaper than buying it online for me.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:30:27
Nope. All you can do is wait. You needed a higher fee. Bitcoin is at it's maximum transaction capacity so your basically biding to have your transaction go through in a reasonable time.
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:26:08
Do you think usage of bitcoin, in percent, has increased the same amount as the price over the past few weeks?
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:53:22
I would say we are approaching bubble territory and you could be buying at the top. Like in 2013. But the bubble won't crash nearly as hard. 
If you're going to do it anyways I'd put only 25% or less. Putting in everything is really risky.
I've seen several posts like this in the past few days where people are risking huge amounts of their wealth because they seen it rocket it up. That makes me think it's a bubble.
But who knows it could double in the next month. No one knows the future. That's just my two cents.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:37:12


Why? I don't see why a system that is somewhere between bitcoin and banks in terms of decentralization isn't viable. And from what I've been reading some alts recently they are already, technically better than bitcoin as a payment system. They can handle 1000+ tps TODAY. Not in a year from now.
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:01:50


Or how about the exchanges becoming flooded with new users?
Or about the reports of higher price in Japan because of increased adoption?
This doesn't really support your claim. Show me some numbers showing mainstream adoption in Japan or any country that correlate with the price rise over the past two weeks. I seriously doubt bitcoin is near being mainstream in any country. Popular than ever sure, but mainstream, I can't imagine that being the case when transaction fees/times are becoming absurd, making it barely worth using as a currency. Store of value maybe, but not a currency.


A massive dump will probably happen.
The fact that everyone is so euphoric tells me we are bubbling.

Don't worry, I completely agree. I think this bubble will actually be smaller than the last few.  And so will the correction. People who think were going to get mass adoption of bitcoin in the next few months are probably deluded. Next few years maybe. But it's hard to imagine mass adoption when bitcoin is almost broken as a payment system with the absurd fees/wait time. Especially since several other cryptos are **actually** innovating the tech right now and are almost better on the technical front.
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:27:16

There was almost no good points in this video. Just a bunch of conspiracy theories about banks manipulating the bitcoin price to scare people away.
Ironically, bitcoin is too big to fail at this point. Even if banks were doing that it would only slow bitcoin down. In the long run blockchain wins.
I bet in 5 years when bitcoin is worth 100,000$ he'll change his tune to "banks control bitcoin and bitcoin is fake money." because of his butt hurt.

Machines aren't going to want to spend enormous fees or have 24hr wait times. They will probably need their funds even faster than humans. Several other cryptocurrencies have already figured out how to scale but bitcoin is lagging behind in this regard.
Bitcoins best use case right now is digital gold.

I'm in Canada so I can't actually buy bitcoins from them "yet". The only reason I got an account was for a hot wallet, meaning I don't care a lot about security because I only carry small amounts of bitcoin in it for extended periods of time. I literally have no reason to continue using them as long as I have other options with more control. I mean really that's what I like about bitcoin, it's empowering, circle... not so much. I want to have complete control over my coins at any moment I please. I want to do exactly what I want with it not what some third party tells me I can do.

It's not unmeasurable. If it's unmeasurable then why the **F** are you making claims about the numbers increasing? You've basically just destroyed your own argument. Because if you can't measure it increasing then you have no evidence to base your claim and it's therefore wild speculation.


You just named several ways that you could measure it. Not super accurate but it's at least some possible ways.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:22:53
The transaction will likely go through at some point just breathe. Could still be another day or two. 
And unfortunately this is due to bitcoins lack of technological innovation. Due to it's lack of consensus in the community.
Bitcoin is becoming a victim of it's own success. The blocks are full and sadly a lot of people who have no idea what's going on with the tech and just saw the price rise like crazy, they will have an awful user experience.

True, if you are gonna do it anyways, only do it with 20 bucks for awhile until you can consistently make money.
This is coming from someone who wrote a bot that used machine learning learning algorithms that could execute trades about a hundred times faster than a human based on a ton of live market data that a human would take hours to analyze. 
I let the bot into the wild for two weeks. I started with $20 USD made it to $23 USD but finished with 17$ USD.
So don't mess with high amounts of cash until you're amazing at it. There's way smarter programmers than me that have made way better bots, so you really have to be something special if you can beat the bots.
Most day traders now days are actually programmers. Or know how to program.

If you read my previous post I said "Not super accurate but it's at least some possible ways." I Never said you could accurately measure it. You're the one claiming to know that adoption is increasing at an accelerated pace and I'm asking how you would know that?


Okay so you have completely flip flopped your argument from **"unmeasurable by definition"** to **"there is enough evidence of it increasing from related statistics.** 
So is it unmeasurable or measurable? And of course I'm not asking for precise numbers because anyone whose taken stats 101 knows that impossible.
If your saying it's measurable then provide your evidence for a significant increase in adoption. That is based on data and not anecdote.

Huh? People switch positions all the time in organizations and that's particularly true in the one I worked in. Not sure why you think I couldn't have switched if I knew their stack especially since they, the IT department, were encouraging me to apply for it regardless of that fact.


Not having a programmer in a company that should have one is a risk. That could be said for any position in a company. But the project I created is not a risk because it's already paid for itself at least couple time over and if something goes wrong there is no chance of destroying anything important. AND the system is easily revertible to the original version which involved physical binders and paper. If the IT department refuses to maintain it or can't, and/or management refuses to hire a programmer after I've left then that's the organizations managements issue for not solving a problem that is very technically trivial to solve.


Because having saved the company hundreds of man hours is some how not practical? What? I really don't get what you're trying to say? The project is already done. It's already worked. I spent probably less than 25 hours total on it and it's saved about 600+ man hours so far. Even if the day I leave they stop using it, I have still enormously helped out the company with it. There's nothing more practical for a capitalist company than having gained 10x+ on an investment.

I also would like to say that if these coffee shops really wanna be "Trendy, Futuristic, or EDgy" they should actually accept bitcoins to purchase coffee, not just have BTM's in the store.
 It seriously is silly to have a BTM in a store and then not be able to use your new bitcoins in said store. It just doesn't make sense. If you want people to use that BTM and therefore give you profits then you should accept it as payment. I bet a lot more people would buy both bitcoins and your coffee if you accepted them. Because people would be interested to see how it actually works and could do this little "experiment" with this "internet money" all in your coffee shop while taking little personal risk on their 10 dollars worth of "internet money"

1. If people are willing to trade dollars or anything else for an altcoin, it is just as real as bitcoin.
2. I haven't heard of any reason to believe that it's fake. If it was fake there probably wouldn't be large price changes correlated with changes in volume. Is it so hard to believe that there is a lot of people trading in crypto and small making fortunes right now?
3. Highly unlikely. Theres already a diverse set of cryptos that can specialize and even do some things better than bitcoin. Once crypto takes over 80% of the wealth will be held in the top 20% of coins. A lot of alt coins are straight up scams though. But I'd argue if you go look at [coin market cap]( the top ten are probably legitment non-scam projects, but just because it's not a scam doesn't mean it will succeed.

Cafe Blanca in Calgary also has a 15% markup on bitcoins and will buy them back for 15% under market value, meanwhile a 5 minute drive to the Waves Coffee by Chinook Centre sells bitcoins at only 6% markup. 
I went to Cafe Blanca specifically to buy bitcoins but luckily, I realized the price was about 60 dollars more than what BTC wisdom was telling me. Definitely not competitive at those rates especially since I can buy bitcoins online at about those prices thus defeating the purpose of buying them in person with cash.

@_date: 2017-07-16 04:16:01
Because if bitcoin is ever going to be a "digital cash" and not just "gold" then it will have to process several orders of magnitude higher TPS. Otherwise fees will always be outrageous for small purchases like coffees or whatever. Today less than 1% of the world owns bitcoin. As the number of users increases linearly the number of transactions will increase exponentially. So scaling is a huge existential threat to bitcoin IMO. Especially if it's starting to actually take off and see mass adoption, it could be a victim of it's own success.
There are already [other blockchains]( that have solved major scaling hurdles that can process 1000 TPS **TODAY** and with payment channels can do 50k. So bitcoin is at least 2-4 years behind on even blockchain tech. Hell even litecoin is technically more advanced with segwit now.
The world won't wait for bitcoin to catch up. If there are significantly better blockchains that don't have these stupid political issues preventing technologically progress, then they will succeed.

Oh yeah, The cost of a computer is probably one of the biggest reasons but in the next 5-10 years a smart phones will probably be affordable to most people on planet earth or at least a few billion more.
Same can be said for my parents though. They didn't get a computer until 
A) the price was low enough 
B) The internet was "readily" available and usable.
Not until both those things were both available at the same time did they actually have a reason to purchase either the internet or computers as regular lay people. I'm thinking the same will happen for the 4.2 billion.
1) The price of internet access(including computers/phones and service providers) is low enough.
2) Bitcoin is "readily" available and usable.
You can argue the latter has already happened.

Because the odds of that happening are trillions of times smaller than receiving an accidental deposit with a bank. That hasn't happened to you in IRL has it? Do you normally get people accidentally depositing into your bank account? That's already extremely unlikely, why do you think it would happen with bitcoin?
For each digit in a bitcoin address, it can be one of 35 possible characters. Each address is also 35 characters long.
So as to say, the odds of someone randomly getting your address are something like 1 in (35^35). That's a huge number. It's more likely you'll win the lottery 10 times then getting an accidental bitcoin.

You are exactly right. Over the past 6 months there has been an influx of new crypto-meme-tards that don't want to accept that this was a bubble and that it's all coming crashing down.
This is very different than the last bubble considering that the last pop had nothing to do with bitcoin but a criminal act on an exchange. This time it has everything to do with the very fundamentals of bitcoin itself both politically and technically. Even if everything does get resolved in the next few months, the prices aren't gonna be good.

I believe that south korea made it legal to use bitcoin for international transfers just this week. Japan also just removed taxes off of bitcoin. Soooo if anything it seems like a lot of countries are opening up to crypto.
They don't blindly follow Americas policies, especially with the current leadership, AND especially with information technology. Japan and Korea tend to adopt new tech a lot faster than the states.

Someone can probably answer this far better than me but, from what I understand it would literally take the age of the universe and then some to generate a set of private keys with any bitcoins in it. With the exception of using bad number generators or making easy targets by having a simple key like 10000000000000000000000... or somthing
Even  if moores law(doubling of computer power every 2 years) continues on forever it will still be a couple hundred years before a computer could generate those private keys.
If computers have that kind of power humans will either be dead or will have solved all our "real" problems and therefore nullifying the need for any currency system.

Sorry, you came in at the wrong time, yes bitcoin is at an all time high, but no one told you that it is running at it's maximum capacity because of political deadlocks/filibustering in the community preventing the technology from innovating. It could still be a couple years before any changes are made that will allow it to scale. It will still work as "digital gold" but it is not going to work as an everyday currency. Without advancing at least.

Uh... That seems pretty obvious, more people using it = more transactions = more money in bitcoin. 


And that's untrue. The causal relationship isn't so clear but there is definitely a correlation. If other people aren't willing to use or accept your token as barter, why would you hold that token? Otherwise it's basically a form speculation, in which case that proves my point **BUBBLE**. There's not a strong enough underlying bitcoin economy to sustain these kinds of prices. IMO
Think about it, if you were able to plot all the n-transactions and the market caps of all fiat currencies would you expect to see a complete noise pattern? Or a trend suggesting that currencies with higher market caps tend to have more transactions per day?  Imagine plotting the zim dollar and then the US dollar on this chart. They would be opposites.. I think it's pretty obvious the answer to that question.
And to further probe my point look [at this chart](

"Value" is something that is completely subjective to human markets. It's whatever people are willing to pay for it. So far bitcoin is worth 30 billion dollars so obviously there's a lot of people that think it's somehow useful as a medium exchange or store of value. Clearly you are probably just in a place of ignorance about it. Which is totally okay if you've never spent the time to learn about it.
All those people who dropped 30 billion into it probably see something you don't. So read up! It's a truly fascinating topic.

Interestingly enough, I've never really even heard the IT department at my job talk much about any cutting edge technologies. Usually just about hockey or something. They just punch in, punch out it seems. 
In fact, even though it's not my job, I wrote a couple programs for the company that saved them hundreds of hours per year. In terms of man hours it had a 10x ROI. And yet I had to fight the IT department to let me do it, for even a smidgen of tech innovation, even though I was doing all of the actual work! Maybe they saw me as a threat or something because I had no formal training and wasn't an "IT guy".
I became completely convinced of bitoins potential around the $200 USD mark after about 18 months of casually knowing/reading about it and told some friends and coworkers to buy a small amount. Of course no one listened, and I've since stopped telling people about it because I think that most people won't believe it or bother spending the time to research on their own.
Innovators and visionaries come in all shapes and sizes. Being in IT only means you probably have a slightly higher than average IQ. That's about it. Doesn't mean you even like IT or have a passion for technology.
Example: Steve Jobs, clearly had a great vision for future technology but wasn't really an "IT guy".

Me. In fact after the first week of operation and ironing out of bugs it hasn't needed to be maintained in almost a year, so it's very robust and stable.


To be fair I don't have any university degree but I have taken a few programming courses here and there as I am in the process of changing careers. +many hours worked on passion projects.


No, and to my knowledge none of them are programmers. The department is only like 5 guys though.


I would be responsible however it's also pretty unlikely it could do any serious damage given the scope of the program. And I also provided a back up system that can be made in 5 minutes with an excel spreadsheet along with documentation and instructions on how to do it. Even that I got push back on because "basic excel skills are hard to find in the company" even though most people use microsoft office on a daily basis there. But it's less efficient in several ways hence way I wrote a script from scratch.
Further, I would argue that allowing employees to waste 600+ man hours a year is damaging to the company, especially when something is such low hanging fruit for automation that some dude that doesn't work in the IT field can wip something up in about 12ish hours of work to fix the problem.


At the time they didn't have a programmer position open. They did tell me to apply for one once it was open but it was in a tech stack I'm not at all familiar with. It was also a short time contract position so it just didn't make sense to switch. I'm also going back to school full-time anyways so whatever.


I totally recognize that. And I do think they are under appreciated for what they do. In fact I usually defend them when I have heard people talk shit about how "they don't do anything". But my point is that just because they are in an IT department doesn't necessarily make them much more receptive to innovation, even if very clear, obvious, and easy like in my case.
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:18:07
Not only is there many free moocs, there is very low cost moocs that only require you to buy the certificate of completion when your done the course. They don't seem to have any problems paying for hosting  of their courses.
Think of it like this: The course cost is $100 and you pay at the end for the certificate once you've completed it. 
If 1000 people take the course but only (3%)30 finish in a year, the profit is $100x30=$3000. 
Now lets try the other model: If 1000 people take the course but only (3%)30 finish in a year, BUTT, the average amount of completion is 35%. There is 1000 people who have paid on average $35 so the profit is 1000x$35=$35,000. 
The profit is literally 10x more with the micropayment model. So a company could make courses even cheaper with this model or just enjoy the bags of gold. And as it stands right now my credit card would basically cost me double if it were to do some form of micropayment because it costs close to a dollar for a transaction and for them to refund me takes at least 3 days, where as with bitcoin it would obviously be faster/cheaper.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:25:25
I'll probably get downvoted for sharing these opinions in this sub but here it goes:
Don't take investment advice from a sub-reddit filled with people that have a vested interest in trying to convince you to invest in bitcoin, especially in a time when people are upset that their bitcoin investment is falling.
You also probably don't know enough about it to invest. There are so many news articles and easily digested books about bitcoin now then there was when it was $300 so just go and do the research and decide for yourself.
If you do decide to invest, only put in small amounts over a long period of time as opposed to all at once. This protects against volatility.
I think that this bubble has already started to POP so now is not the greatest time to invest IMO. Maybe wait a few weeks or months.
And lastly my most controversial opinion, bitcoin was only the first implementation of blockchain technology. There are many other blockchains that are arguably much, much better in terms of tech. As with any technology, it is exceedingly rare that the first iteration is the "best" version of it. There are thousands of other blockchains out there, it's likely that some of those are better than bitcoin and/or will have a better ROI.

About a year ago I had a little debate on another sub with a guy who claimed to have a masters in CS who was kind of shitting on bitcoin and used his degree/expertise to shit on it. Of course he clearly didn't  actually know a lot about how it actually worked. He just more or less had a knee-jerk skepticism towards it. I was really interested in his perspective though.
After a bit of dialog where I addressed his main arguments against it he actually became much more interested in it and conceded that he could actually be wrong about it and that he was going to actually look in to it.

False, Just like bitcoin ripple(XRP) has a limited supply. [There is about 100 billion total]( and there will not be anymore created unless someone successfully forks the network and changes the protocol, but bitcoin faces that exact same risk.


False, [the ripple network is decentralized.]( Maybe less than bitcoin in terms of number of nodes/validators, but a hell of a lot more than paypal.


Not sure where you heard that but you do not need to KYC to transact or purchase ripple(XRP). In fact I'm willing to give you some XRP right now just to prove it. It can be used in the exact same way bitcoin can for peer to peer transfers, just its faster and cheaper. [You don't even need to KYC to be a node/validator](


If someone is willing to sell for ripple yes you can. Nothing can stop a ripple transaction just like with bitcoin.


YES! AND YES! That is LITERALLY THE WHOLE FRIGGING POINT! Have you even been to their website or wiki?  ["Payments can only be authorized by the account holder and all payments are processed automatically without any third parties or intermediaries. Payments are irreversible, and there are no chargebacks. ripple(XRP) cannot be frozen or seized."]( JUST LIKE BITCOIN! I seriously don't think you've read anything about ripple outside of this subreddit given how far off the mark you are.


Oh please do, and maybe provide some sources? Rather than making up crap.


You must be a troll.
I actually don't own any XRP at the moment but I'd be willing to go to an exchange and get some just to demonstrate how wrong you are on almost every point you made.

I can disprove some of your points right now, like giving you some ripple in seconds without the need to KYC. That means you are **wrong** on that point.
Although that doesn't mean ripple will be successful and bitcoin won't, but you don't have any of your facts right.
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:05:10


But very slowly. Think about it. Why are banks playing with other cryptos and blockchains like ripple but not bitcoin? 
When will bitcoin be able to handle 1000 TPS? One or two years? In an ideal scenario? Ripple can do that today and for cheaper. By the time bitcoin scales to 1000 TPS ripple will have fully implemented their payment channels and will be doing 50k TPS.
At the end of the day no one (as in regular joes) cares if their digital currency is slightly more decentrilized or not. They just want a system that functions well. A system that isn't controlled by central banks and that can't have their funds stolen or counterfeited by the government or anyone else. A trust-less mechanism to transact value on the internet. That's the whole use case for bitcoin and yet in terms of a system ripple currently functions an order of magnitude better than bitcoin. So ripple is arguably a better bitcoin than bitcoin.
And given the asicc monopoly it's debatable whether bitcoin is really all that decentralized anyways.

No it's not a private blockchain. I'm sorry but you clearly are not read up on Ripple. It's an opensource project with a public ledger just like Bitcoin. A private blockchain would just be an inefficient database.
["Anyone can run their own rippled server that follows the network and keeps a complete copy of the Ripple ledger. You can even have your server take part in the consensus process."] (


I'm not even sure what you mean by that exactly? It absolutely can be used by random people to transact and buy stuff, it's just that is not the market that the Ripple company is currently going after. They just have a top down approach as apposed to bitcoins bottom up in terms of marketing.
In fact I can even give you some ripple right now if you want? It can not only be used in the exact same way bitcoin can, but it's already solved major scaling issues.
This is the current state of the bitcoin network (as of a few weeks ago) vs Ripple.
:--|:--|:--|:--                                 
Transactions per second|1000|7
$ per transaction|0.000002|1.4

Ripple (the company) owns about 60% of the total supply which they are locking up in a smart contract to sell a little bit every month for the next 5 years. Once it's in the smart contract it's effectively set in stone and the market will know exactly what will happen. The rest is liquid in the market basically.
There is no inflation in XRP. It's deflationary just like bitcoin. In order to create inflation or new coins you would have to create a fork or 51% attack just like you would with bitcoin to change the total supply.


It is based on math, as I said earlier it would require 51% attack on all the nodes to create new tokens or change the protocol to add inflation, just like with bitcoin. The main difference between bitcoin and ripple is that ripples consensus mechanism doesn't require mining so it's much more efficient while being just as secure (thus far).
It's an opensource project just like bitcoin. Ripple (the company) is the equivalent to a for profit version of blockstream or core. Ripple  (the currency) can continue regardless of Ripple (the company). Since it's opensource anyone can develop or fork the protocol just like bitcoin.

Some would argue that the monopoly that a certain company has on mining chips has made bitcoin centralized.

I am OP. And I have no idea what you mean by "I can get education just tipping $0.00002"? Can you clarify?
Being able to quit at the end of the course is not what I'm talking about. I mean you pay for it in many micropayments so even half way through the course you can quit and you only pay for the work you actually did. So if you only complete 50%(reading,questions,exams, ect.) you've only payed for 50% of the course.
Its the differences between paying a flat monthly rate for your phone bill or pay as you go. With pay as you go you only pay for the exact minutes/text/data you use and depending on how often you use your phone you might actually save money with pay as you go instead of the flat rate.
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:51:35

If you know so much about ripple and bitcoin it should be easy for you to prove your statements. And even if you don't convince me maybe you'll convince someone who is on the fence. This would enrich you if you swayed someones opinion enough to purchase bitcoin.

Brave has one of the few legit projects and teams. Lead by Brendan Eich (the creator of JavaScript, Firefox, and now Brave). Brave has been released for over a year and is a great browser (at least on mobile) so this organization and team has a history of actually producing high quality and influential products.
They held an ICO which went over reasonably well compared to others but it does put them in a bad light because most iCOs are for shit projects. And it makes them look too similar to these other projects on the surface. But in reality you can't really compare the creator of JavaScript to some no name twenty something with an indistinguishable European accent. The r/batproject has a superstar tech team and their timeline and whole project is just on a whole different level than most of these other ICOs.

What would the HTTP of bitcoin be though?

I actually believe that will be the case **ONLY** if segwit gets activated. Bitcoin needs to scale. There are altcoins that can already do 1000 TPS right now and with payment channels can do 50k. On the internet of value the amount of money that will be transmitted daily will be insane. Bitcoin doesn't have a chance at handling even the volume for all gold/bitcoin bugs globally at 7 TPS let alone micropayments and daily transactions for (hundreds of ) millions of "normal people".
Bitcoin is lagging behind on innovation unfortunately. Although in someways that's actually a good thing because it means its hard to change unless it really needs to, which makes it a great store of value. If it doesn't start moving towards scaling soon it will have lost completely. But if bitcoin can get lightning it will probably be the greatest store of value, but with other currencies being used for micropayments and day to day stuff. 
I know that this is probably an unpopular FUD opinion though, so feel free to downvote.

I would say in ICO is probably an order of magnitude more risky than an IPO though given the complete lack of regulation. But yes not a scam in itself.

Wow! They were only three letters off from predicting the future! That's like some conspiracy theory fuel right there!

How is it away from the idea of "crypto currencies"? With some coins such as ripple, where mining doesn't happen there is basically no way of getting around an ICO other than giving away coins for free.

That's not really what Bitcoin stands against. Bitcoin is more against central banks/governments control over money. Banks can and do provide a legitimate service of securing money. And sometimes even physical goods, keeping some gold in a private vault that you rent for example.
And even if it is against ALL forms of banks, would you be angry if banks started using Bitcoin? No you'd probably be happy. 
It's the same with ripple, the only difference (aside from the massively improved tech) is the marketing strategy, which is trivial in the long term. 
You can use Ripple just like banks use ripple. No one can stop you just like with bitcoin. And banks can start using bitcoin and no one can stop them. The main reason why they haven't is because bitcoin has been lagging on innovation and scaling, hence why there is over 100+ large banks experimenting or using the ripple network currently.

So ethereum and ripple are scams? 
Obviously there is a lot of scam iCOs but having one doesn't necessarily make it a scam.

The thing that bothers me the most is they kept referring to cryptocurrency as "cybercurrency". I can't tell if that's on purpose or if they just didn't research it enough to realize there is already a term used for blockchain currencies.

Don't be so emotional. Only put in what you can afford to lose.

Lets say you have 100 days to complete the course. Every day after 100 is -1% of the total cash you can earn back. And every day before 100 is +1%

Yeah, it's as if bubbles or crashes can only happen when the price is manipulated. Free markets never generate bubbles. /s

What? How does that make any sense? That's literally exactly what it means. Anyone can go to an exchange and sell bitcoin for the current exchange rate.
