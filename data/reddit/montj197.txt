I bought some  with 4 of my colleagues at the same time.they were new to this.
And now when it dropped to 13k ,i was amused at their faces daily.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:57:04
Thats the beauty of bitcoin.developers work hard trying to make it perfect...its a long process.
Not just as easy as increasing a variable.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:08:53
How is this different fron segwit...segwit removes witness data and schnor compresses signatures?
How much effective size each block wouls have after implementing both of them?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:52:04
Yes you are.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:26:19
It sells your hashing power and buyers buy it with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:11:27
25k till new year ...buuy it.

The second rule of bitcoin.
"The best time to buy bitcoin was in 2009 ,the second best time is now".
Dont regret it.we are here for the long run.
Remember hodl and buy the dips.

A rolling rock up from a mountain.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:43:35
So true
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:40:55
First rule of btc is-
Invest which you can afford to lose.
You never know when it may drop.
Its risky,people have had their luck but be carefull.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:44:03
Nice shitpost
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:42:09
We dont need forks. We will have LN soon which wil solve these problems soon.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:46:39
Its the original,first ever crypto currency.

How can you get injured that bad.
What position do you play at?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:52:58
There is ony one good advice.....buy the dips and hodl...all other is bullshit.

Got confirmed in an hour...
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:01:42
First- Do your research.
Second- check out the daily thread about segwit amd Ln Progress.
Third- you wouldnt need the third step if you had done the above two first..
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:29:17
Dude you should have seen 17500 wall in the past days....it was around 1.5k btc..

Thank you,the first link is really informative!  
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:22:14
Ok i brought it back...after reading all of your comments........������....i will stop looking profit/loss...just hodl
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:13:05
The thing he said is true....active trading is stressfull and unpredictable in bitcoin ......
Just use your 20% at the right time time to buy everymonth..
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:23:49
Trueeee....what are your plans for now? Hold or sell and expect it to drop?
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:18:34
It is true at end.. everyone wants money.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:49:10
No it wont
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:29:40
300 dollar? Here its 100 dollar
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:00:33
Why cant you refer it by the name BCH? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:08:10
I am gonna buy at 5500��
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:17:09
It wont
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:27:43
Who's at the right? BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:24:31
No it will come soon, i heard that they got  90%positive results in integration tests..it was 63 before.....
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:45:34
Block size upgrade is not the solution.....Its a temporary one...it will suppress the problem for an year or two but wont solve it..bitcoin is still strong because people believe in it.right now bitcoin is used for store of value..once LN comes it will be used for transactions ,very cheap transactions..
If the prices fall for some greater good in future ,then we should be ready and hodl it.
Segwit 2x is just a variable change in the code..the core deva havent implemented it because they know its not worth it...please leave this to them...
AND noone is getting scammed!.this whole thing is a conspiracy , being played by the same who wanted segwit 2x.they are pumping their btc into bcash and moving hash rates to bcash because its more profitable to mine until difficulty readjusts.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:42:32
No increase in blocksize.
We have segwit..which hasnt been adopted by everyone..the 1mb block will act as 4 mb block..
And after that we have many technologies like LN which will end all debate about transaction fees and time.Patience is what we should increase within ourselves.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:51:34
Please more predictions please
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:26:44
Make me clear about this thing..you mean setting a target date for segwit 2x?.means losing the fight we have been fighting for 3 months or maybe longer?
After monday the hash power will come back to bitcoin when difficulty adjusts.dont panic......
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:50:23
You get ROI in 3 months approx...may reach 4-5  months depending on profitability
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:56:33
Tracking is tough,you have very less chance.you can ask exchanges for information about that address.but noone would reveal unless you are a government agency.i dont think anyone would be so generous to give that amount back ,now that prices are high..
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:00:40
Coz maybe he is a smart guy and moved his btc to a wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:35:16
Lets not lie...i admit i have done the same with bitcoin only....buying at Ath and selling at 1000$ lower.... :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:07:24
The one who has the seeds of that address can only give your money back.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:59:24
No we are not, patience is all you need man..if you want upvote we can upvote..but i think your plea wont be accepted..
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:50:02
You can set it up for a stable network,but processing time only and only depends on hash power.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:19:14
Its digital gold
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:28:53
Good for trading...bitcoin defies all these
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:08:47
Wait till lightning comes
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:22:50
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:43:48
Trading quantity is low there 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:46:16
Idk why it is one top now,maybe due to its new algorithm. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:50:24
What are your interests

Becausw their website has always issues....always
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:52:19
Use it on nicehash,domt waste your time on mining bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:59:11
I see good ass ,i give upvote.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:00:15
3000 invested and 700 per month is good.My point was ROI and youre fine. All the best dude.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:10:26
How can you make it great when its already great.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:12:08
Well my exchange took 0.002 btc to transfer 0.01 btc
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:02:47
I wasngonna do the same.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:47:51
You cannot mine bitcoin until or unless you got many of those asic boost ant miners.
Mine on nicehash.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:50:47
Russia and europian countries are moving in too...so thats decentralised

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:00:20
First ask for bob and vagena
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:05:57
Are you another nonsense guy from bch community?.looks like so
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:25:56

@_date: 2017-11-23 18:14:25
Or sell
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:04:01
I started working 3 months ago...i own 0.06 :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:40:52
A few more dollars...omg so excited...
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:50:51
Please dont take loan
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:22:12
Best time to invest in bitcoin was  6 years ago,second time is now.
Though i would say buy it now...you never know when the next dip will be..
Buy again when next dip comes..thats what everyone does
I would say if you have 1000 dollars..buy for 400-500 and save remaining for next dip.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:15:40
Your kid should take handwriting lessons.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:20:54
Dont panic...just hodl..
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:38:21
Happens everytime with me
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:16:01
How much do you earn from nicehash?
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:24:23
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:02:00
Dude you were really mining satoshis? You would seriously earn more btc mining nicehash rather than mining btc...you can earn like 0.01 btc per month from nicehash .try it
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:31:14
I believe in bitcoin,and when lightning comes...it will be the best thing...just having patience and hodling out....
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:25:12
Oh look another shitty post.stfu and hodl
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:37:39
The links are not working.fake
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:22:33
Its easy...create many accounts on diff exchanges...split your money and withdraw..easy
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:59:20
I am so much waiting for this soooooo much
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:50:28
You gonna invest 7000 dollars to mine 500 -600 dollars worth of btc a month?...
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:51:02
Time to buy &lt;3
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:02:24
Oh wait..there is gonna be a sale? Like @ at 6500?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:41:25
I always laugh at this
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:28:10
Still hope btc survives?see you after bcash difficulty adjustment
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:24:36
It takes 10 minutes for a transaction to confirm normally....and to be honest 10 mins is fine until LN comes
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:56:01
Hey are you able to buy it now?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:21:37
Lol what?

Quality meme lol
@_date: 2018-11-17 13:54:06

@_date: 2018-02-18 22:33:43
It wont be if you create a malware which infects a million pcs.thats like 10-50 h/s in monero multiplied by a million.the hacker can easily gain much.

@_date: 2018-12-07 12:26:51
Why did bcash split, can anyone tell?
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:38:15
Thanks for your reply.
I never believed in bch because of the one man propoganda.
They were going to take on btc and they got divided from the inside..
