I hope not to. I hope for the time people can invest their 401k into crypto like stocks and shares. I feel like if/when that happens, it will be too late for them to be able to do anything about it as most of them (gov,banks) will have holdings in it as well.

I mean when it forked you had equal amounts of bcash as you did btc. As a LONGGG term hodler I have NO idea why you didn't just HODL both. If the money moved from btc to bcash it's all good because you have BOTH. No idea why people just dump their new forked coins they received rather than just keep them and see how it plays out.

Just use JS to set the opacity of the image based on the price %. 
var percentage = lamboPrice/btcPrice
element.style.opacity = percentage

1000 years later when the value keeps going up he employees more people to guard the wall. He builds upon the wall making it bigger and more secure. He then created some lore to distract people from the real reason of the wall. It was made to keep some undead monsters from beyond the wall and this was how the nights watched was formed.

I was literally just about to post about this. That surge in BCH must be newbies making mistakes surely!

This is exactly what I done. Got in with as much as I was willing to risk. It had doubled in about 3 months time. Took my original investment back out. Currently it's coming close to being 4x what I got it at so some would FOMO massively and be kicking themselves but I'm much more happy with the fact it's completely risk free now and whatever it's worth is all profit and money I never had. It's basically free Bitcoin in my eyes.

Did you spend all your bitcoins on the house or was it like a % of your stack?

What even happened to Bitcoin Gold? Is there a wallet I can use to claim it? Is it even on any exchanges yet?
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:45:46
What I meant was: A random person on the internet that has dank DBZ memes ready to post for when bitcoin hit $9000 means bitcoin is bullish (it will go up, the buying demand increases) as fuck.

This for me is the only true real potential risk, laws being passed on it. However I feel like the more time that goes on the less likely this will happen with many other countries starting to adopt crypto. But in all honestly how will the west deal with lots of people from poorer countries getting very wealthy in 40 years when bitcoin is $1,000,000? Who knows.

Coinbase is a really easy and simple place the average person can go to and buy BTC, ETH or LTC. 
GDAX is a trading platform. So it's the sort of thing you'd expect like a forex day trader or someone who day trades gold, stocks, shares, and more to use. The sort of thing that has loads of charts, you can place market orders, stops, stop losses and all that day trading stuff. Which of course can look very daunting and confusing if you have never used one before or know how different orders works. 
Coinbase has none of that, you can't put in and order to say, long (buy) bitcoin if the price goes to $5000. All you can do is simply buy or sell Bitcoin at it's current price.
GDAX and Coinbase are owned by the same company.

"if people can trade BTC and co on GDAX, why even involve coinbase?"  Because the average person would not even know how to use GDAX and place an order. Coinbase is doing something awesome which is making it really simple and easy for anyone to buy bitcoin or crypto.
Coinbase fees are a lot higher than GDAX. You are literally paying for the easy of use. If you know how to place trades on a trading platform go for GDAX. Also if you place a stop order to buy bitcoin and this is then get fulfilled by someone you get zero fees at all. Just look up buying on GDAX with no fees. There are plenty of guides that explain it.

Sorry for the dummy question. My bitcoin are stored in a Electrum wallet so I have access to private keys etc. When the fork happens if I obtain a BCC client/wallet does this mean I would have both BTC and the equivalent BCC but they are linked? As in if I were to sell the BTC it would also remove the BCC and visa versa? So basically I have a choice if/when I sell it as to which fork I pick to sell? Or do I literally get both and they aren't linked at all? So I receive BCC for free?
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:23:03
Awesome thank you, would you rather LBC over the ATM though?
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:31:19
I'm assuming by pulling off an exchange you mean to a local wallet of some sort. In this case it would not cause a crash. A crash would happen if many people sell. The coins are just being moved, not sold. The supply/demand hasn't changed, just how people are storing/keeping coins. It would be like rather than having $100 in the bank, you remove it and put it in a little safe instead.

Perfect thanks!
