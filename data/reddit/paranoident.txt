If you agree that there needs to be a cap, the actual number doesn't really matter. Not only is the 21M arbitrary, the unit of Bitcoin is an arbitrary multiple (100,000,000) of the base unit. Over time, the markets will (hopefully) discover the value of this arbitrary unit. In some alternate reality that's exactly like ours except that Satoshi decided on a cap of 42M - the markets would settle at the value per unit being half of what it is in our reality. There's no way for us or the protocol to dictate this value or to pin it to say USD. You can try by buying up BTC whenever it goes under your target and selling when it's over - but if the market disagrees with your valuation, you'll soon run out of either Bitcoins or whatever fiat you're buying them with.
Without a cap, you lack the incentive that drives people right now to invest in Bitcoin. Getting something like Bitcoin of the ground is a chicken &amp; egg problem - you need an economy using it for it to have value but no one is going to use it for business if they don't perceive it to have some value in the first place. The artificial scarcity basically harnesses human greed as rocket fuel to bootstrap Bitcoin into a state where there is sufficient economy built on top of it. Fortunately there are altcoins trying both approaches so we'll see empirically which one works - but I'm betting on Bitcoin.
Interestingly, though altcoins provide value in exploring the alternative scenarios (not varied enough I'd say, but they do help) - they also run on that same rocket fuel that Bitcoin uses (i.e. the competition for this initial speculative investment is probably a zero sum game) so there's a possibility that there isn't enough collective human greed to get any of the cryptos into the steady orbit and they all fail. However judging by what I know of humans so far - I think there's plenty of that fuel to go around for one to make it and Bitcoin is definitely on the right trajectory.
If one of the cryptos does become self sustaining (i.e. salaries paid in it, countries settling trade deficits, companies purchasing other companies with it, etc.) I imagine all the other coins will fade to insignificance (in the same way that Bitcoin is insignificant relative to all the economic activity in the world today) simply due to the overwhelming network effect of the winner.
One thing that may be hard to appreciate right now due to how fast things seem to be moving is that this is going to take a long time. Decades for sure. The infrastructure has to be built, we need to figure out how to program and use computers securely, the law needs to be updated. It's a long time for the early adopters to just hold onto the alleged 40-50%. They'll spend it, lose it, they'll die and their children will spend it, etc. As unfair as it may seem, I don't think it will play a big role in the success or failure of crypto. And when you start thinking about it in centuries - the initial distribution becomes completely irrelevant.
As for theft, I don't really get the point of the argument. Again, it's not fair - but it's not like vast amounts of conventional wealth isn't tainted in some way. I'm sure much of the gold supply has been stolen many times over in the last few millennia. The truly novel thing about Bitcoin is that an individual can for the first time really protect his or her wealth. We're not very good at it yet but there's a huge incentive now to figure it out.
TLDR: Bitcoin is a get rich slow scheme with a big probability of total failure. Going to the moon may seem incredible because you're looking at it from the ground right now. But with enough baby steps over the next few decades, we'll either get to the moon or crash and burn spectacularly. :)

Not really, BTC is just a toy at the current price. Say you wanted to buy Whatsapp from Zuckerberg for $19 billion (i.e. more than a double of the current BTC market cap) - yeah, not a chance.

I think Doge did a couple of good things:
* It was a pretty big marketing win for cryptos - by bringing new people and by giving a face saving way in for old skeptics ("oh, I'm just going to 'sarcastically' mine some Doge coin..." .. aaaand they're hooked!)
* It demonstrated how little value most alt coins bring to the table technically (Doge is clearly a cheap knockoff.. but then how exactly is LTC any different?)
* It's a great learning tool. You get to basically use the same software as with BTC, without the risk of losing 'real' money :)

If you think of Bitcoin as cash that can be sent electronically - it has the same level of consumer protection as USD cash. The extra power it provides opens up a whole new class of stupid things that you can do with it. Over time (provided that it doesn't fail in some other way), we'll figure out where it works well and where it doesn't and the equivalent of the fiat financial infrastructure will inevitably grow on top of this base layer to address issues such as customer protection.
However even now, as raw as the whole experience still is, I prefer to pay with BTC if I can. I'd rather not have my CC information scattered in databases around the world. Despite all the consumer protection that exists for CC, identity theft is a real problem that can take years to fix. With BTC purchases, the only sensitive information I have to give out is the shipping address (and I'm shipping to my work). For that reason alone I've just placed an order with TigerDirect instead of Newegg.
When I completed the order, Google popped up an offer to protect it via their [Trusted Store program]( for up to $1000. This was completely unexpected and I have no idea if paying with BTC invalidates this protection somehow but I think it's a great example of things to come. There is a big incentive for merchants to voluntarily participate in programs like this as ripping customers off is not a viable long term strategy. Thieves with stolen CCs have no such incentives and will continue to abuse the system that's meant to protect the honest consumer. The cost of this fraud is most definitely passed on to your CC purchases.

Not quite as easy as debit card, but I have just successfully deposited USD into bitfloor.com directly from my checking account using PopMoney (bitfloor also supports ING's Person2Person transfer). It took 3 business days for the money to reach bitfloor, no fees were charged.
If you already have a checking account with a bank that supports one of these payment types, it's by far the easiest and cheapest way to buy BTC. My previous source was checking -&gt; Dwolla -&gt; MtGox, it took forever and now they need annoying extra verification.
Bitfloor's volumes are low but I got my $50 worth of BTC at a good price.
Good luck!

You don't even need a full client for a brain wallet - you can generate your private key using  (in the 'Wallet Details' tab, if you enter a passphrase into the private key field, it will offer to hash it with sha256 into a private key). You can even download that site and run it locally without a network connection - it's all JavaScript.
Then import the corresponding bitcoin address into blockchain.info for balance monitoring. Make sure you remember the passphrase! :)

He's the Bitcoinica guy. He sold it to the Intersango guys, then robbed their Mt.Gox account. When he got caught, he came up with a ridiculous story about some Chinese millionaire art collector/dealer who apparently hacked his email account and used it to frame Zhou. When confronted, the mysterious hacker immediately agreed to give all money back to Zhou. Now Zhou is being a little bitch relishing other people's misery.

I've used both cash deposit via Chase (very quick - usually under an hour) and PopMoney (convenient but takes at least 3 business days).
I really like them so far - due to the low volume you can often get a better price than MtGox when buying.
Note that Chase may put an end to this if the volume goes up - until then, it's two thumbs up from me.
EDIT: I also prefer BitFloor's interface over Mt.Gox, it's more polished and flexible.

That's how I see it, I put in small % of my disposable income on semi-regular intervals into Bitcoin.
As for the technical hurdles, it's certainly a bit of a learning curve but it's not that bad. Here's what I did:
* Created a 'brain wallet' - basically an account that I can recreate easily with just a long passphrase that I remember (and have written down in a safe place so that my wife can get to it if I croak). You can do this by going to [bitaddress.org]( clicking on 'Wallet Details' tab and entering your **multiword, super-secret, unguessable passphrase** in the private key field. It will say that it's not a valid private key and offer to hash the passphrase into a valid key (which you want to accept). The site then generates the public and private keys - you can print them out and store the page in a safe / safety deposit box.
* To deposit money into this account, you only need the 'Bitcoin address'. Note that no one can get to your bitcoins with just this address so you can have it on a post-it note stuck to your monitor if you like (though you can see the account balance with it). The thing that you absolutely don't want anyone to get to is the private key. Keep that thing off your computer! Use the privacy mode on the browser and disconnect from the internet after you loaded the page but before entering the passphrase, wipe the browser cache afterwards.
* To monitor the balance I use the fantastic [blockchain.info]( - create a new wallet, then go to the Import / Export tab and enter your brain wallet's bitcoin address into the 'Add Watch Only Bitcoin Address' field. Even if blockchain.info would get hacked or turn malicious, your bitcoins are safe as they don't have your private key.
* Then I opened an account with the [bitfloor exchange](
* Bitfloor allows cash deposits via Chase branches - just deposit deposit the money to the specified account, take a photo of the receipt with my phone and email it to the admin. The money becomes available within an hour.
* Buy Bitcoins and immediately withdraw them into my 'brain wallet' bitcoin address.
I prefer this solution to the many other options because I don't have a need right now to get to my bitcoins very often. I don't have to worry about backing everything up - as long as I can remember my passphrase I can always get to my money. I don't have to worry about my computer getting hacked / infected with keylogger / etc. I can always see the balance thanks to blockchain.info and I can easily deposit small amounts of cash thanks to bitfloor. Btw I highly recommend going through the process with a tiny amount of money first - just to make sure that you get a good grasp of how it all works. Hope that helps!
@_date: 2012-08-06 16:56:03
You can't 'trust' your own computer's security unless it's not connected to the internet (and even then a burglar can get to it). Use a brain wallet, keep your private keys away from the internet and store your passphrase securely in multiple locations.
There are many ways to implement a brain wallet - probably the easiest is to generate your private key using  (click the Wallet Details tab, then enter a *long* passphrase into the private key field). The site will offer to hash the passphrase with sha256 and generate public &amp; private keys in various formats. Print the page out &amp; store in a safe somewhere. Remember the passphrase. Enter the public address into a  wallet so that you can easily monitor the balance.

Zhou Tong is a criminal largely responsible for this mess. However Intesango / Bitcoinica Consultancy were in a position to help people get their money back but they just walked away when Zhou robbed them again. 
Now that Zhou was caught and returned the money - the only reason people can't get their money back is that these guys just couldn't be bothered to deal with this anymore.

Not linked to value of some fiat currency (
Basically if/when the fed prints more money and causes inflation, the value of USD relative to other currencies will go down. Having your money in Bitcoins protects you from that. Of course there are much crazier swings happening in Bitcoin world right now but over long term it should be a win.

I think Bitcoin is fundamentally unfair in that respect - it throws away the rulebook entirely :). This is where I think the legal challenges to exchanges and other infrastructure will be the real test of its strength.
I don't really see a difference between waiting for confirmation and waiting to see if there was a chargeback. BTC payment is announced and verified almost instantly (certainly faster than some CC readers used by smaller merchants). The moment it's posted on the network, the merchant can see it, verify the signature and the balance on the sending account. In my opinion this is already much stronger than a CC payment. Bitcoins give you the option to be almost 100% certain that the payment is valid within an hour as opposed to a month, which makes many think that this needs to happen. However it is really up to the merchant to decide what is an acceptable risk vs customer convenience tradeoff.
Regardless of regulation, I think it would be pretty hard to implement a no-chargeback system on top of current banking infrastructure. You can only really guarantee a payment instantly if both the payer and receiver hold their funds with the same institution. Inter-bank clearing takes days and I believe can also be reversed. FX adds an extra layer of complexity. A no-chargeback CC provider would end up owning all the risk for little extra revenue (higher merchant fees?). In fact probably the best way to implement such a service would be to use Bitcoins as the back end.
At the end of the day, nobody really knows yet. I think BTC is a very different beast to existing currencies and trying to understand it in terms of what we know will only give us limited insight. This is where the markets come in and sort it out for us - an ocean of enterprising minds all trying to exploit the system in some crazy new way.

Not sure if trolling or just daft, but I'll bite...
Are you suggesting that a 51% attack on the block chain is easier to pull off than paying with a stolen CC? The chances of being targeted by a highly expensive and complicated block chain attack are in the ballpark of the risk of being hit by a meteorite. I can only assume that I misunderstand what you're trying to say.
Regarding profitability of mining - I was countering the OPs ridiculous notion that one can build up 51% worth of processing power for free. Note the 'if' in the sentence, it was a hypothetical statement. Or were you agreeing with me? It's hard to tell...
Not sure what to make of the gibberish in caps. Yes, if a merchant decides to hold on to BTC - they are exposed to the risk of highly volatile exchange rate. That is however not a requirement for accepting payments in Bitcoins and the minimal fees + no chargebacks are great incentives for adoption.


Is that a rhetorical question? If it doesn't work, or fails to offer enough of a benefit for wider adoption - of course it will be abandoned. What is your point?
People dumping all their savings into BTC are, at best, extremely foolish. That has nothing to do with Bitcoin's viability as a vehicle for near instant and secure transfer of value and that kind of 'investment' will never provide enough volume. The real volume will come from millions of merchants serving millions of clients all over the world, using Bitcoins as temporary tokens to securely complete each transaction in unprecedented privacy. This is what it is all about and all of the speculation on MtGox is peripheral (as long as the miners are getting enough out of it to continue to secure the block chain). Will it work out? Who the hell knows? The odds are against it but it probably won't fail over any of the reasons suggested by OP and it's certainly very interesting to observe.
What I'd like to know is - what's up with the poorly informed Bitcoin bashers here? Did you lose a bunch of money speculating on the market? Is this some harebrained scheme to manipulate the value of BTC? There are plenty of legal, technical and social problems to discuss so why rehash the same old tired and self evidently invalid arguments?
@_date: 2011-09-20 20:08:37
The key word here is 'current'. None of those are inherent and will be resolved over the next few years.
Though I'm not sure if I'd classify the volatility as a problem - it attracts speculators who give us much needed liquidity. It's not like the merchants have to manually relabel all their merchandise - this is all automatic. Stability will come with higher volumes - right now a few hundred thousand dollars can move the market 20%...
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:45:31
I've pretty much written the ~300USD worth of cash &amp; bitcoins off when this whole thing went down, but I have to say they did get my hopes up with that reclaim procedure. Fool me once shame on you, etc. :)

@_date: 2011-06-17 22:45:01
Why should people trust you? I'm really not trying to be mean, I was playing with similar idea but I think the issue of trust is a showstopper.
You may think you're the good guy now, you're probably convinced you would never defraud your customers. I feel the same way. However imagine a scenario where your XBTC company succeeds and manages private keys for thousands of customers - worth in total say 500k Bitcoins. You may even be making a decent amount of money on the transaction fees. Now what if the price hits $100/BTC? Can you be absolutely sure that $50 million dollars won't suddenly become too much of a temptation? What about half a billion?
It doesn't necessarily even have to be you that turns to dark side. You will probably employ a bunch of smart people to write the software and maintain the servers. Can you be sure none of them will defraud you and your customers when the potential gains are so mindbogglingly huge?
I think this is one of the biggest unsolved problems in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin itslef pulls off the magic trick of allowing safe transactions without requiring any level trust. The same does not apply for services that are growing around it - such as Mt Gox, MyWallet and potentially your XBTC. Things will get interesting if or when one of them disappears in a puff of smoke with some unimaginable amount of other people's money.
**TLDR** - Don't trust your future self. Don't trust others with (unencrypted) private keys.
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:24:58
Mine was just denied (2:20 GMT - less than 2 hours before the trade is supposed to reopen)
This looks like a scam to me, I filled the reclaim form from the same IP that I have done most of my Mt. Gox business from and I have provided my Dwolla account number.
I may be paranoid but I'd bet this is their way of preventing the bank run...

Confirmation time for close to 100% certainty is 1 hour - compared to something like a month for CC / ACH payments. This is a massive improvement. Online orders usually take much longer than that to process, package and ship. I'm not yet sure BTC is the right solution for in person transactions but if they are, a single confirmation is a much tougher hurdle for a criminal than using a cloned / stolen CC or just running off with the merchandise.
I agree that securing the block chain needs more work but I don't buy your proposed attack vector (i.e. building a 51% cluster for 'free' - if mining is profitable for you to be getting free hardware, you can bet your ass there will be others doing the same). Attack on the block chain is pretty expensive and rather noticeable, allowing the stakeholders to react before the attacker does enough damage to recoup his expenses.
There's nothing intolerable about the current volatility if a.) you anchor your prices to a less volatile asset and b.) you don't expose yourself to it by holding onto BTC. The actual price of BTC is irrelevant, the magic comes from the fact that you can securely transfer value between untrusted parties. If you think the volatility is a headache, stick to CC / PayPal and compete with merchants that do accept BTC - let the market decide. The real problem for merchants right now is that (as you correctly pointed out) the client is unwieldy, online wallets are untrustworthy and it's hard to go from USD to BTC. These are all fixable and people are busy fixing them as we speak.
Regarding volatility's impact on liquidity, I'd agree with you if we'd be talking about an established market. Right now the non-speculative volume is too low for professional traders to bother with. If we had a stable price and none of the "OMG - BTC will be worth $10,000" crowd - you would not see the kind of liquidity that MtGox offers right now. The market is bootstrapping right now, give it time. As the non-speculative volume rises, you'll need a lot more cash to move the market significantly and things will settle down.
@_date: 2011-08-03 19:12:19


Why do we need one? The whole point of Bitcoin is that individuals can be their own bank. Hopefully we'll see better tools to make it easy for individuals to keep their wallets safe.
I have a simple rule - don't ever share unencrypted **private** keys with any person or organization. When you send your keys, it's equivalent to magically teleporting a pile of cash to someone you don't know.
My mind boggled that people kept any serious amount of BTC in MyBitcoin (and similar services). I hope this event, whether it turns out to be fraud or accident, will teach people to respect the realities of Bitcoins rather than blindly following the old models.

She does sound great. Bitcoin community desperately needs more people like her (i.e. with a working brain and some business sense).
The prevalent thinking of an average Bitcoin entrepreneur seems to be: 'Look at industry X - it's making billions! I know, I'll do the same thing but accept BTC. Instawealth!'

What about few billion dollars? What if you can make it look like someone else ran off with the money and not even worry about the fugitive status? Can you be absolutely positively sure that your future self, under some extreme circumstances wouldn't succumb to the temptation?
It's way, way harder to move USD around the way you can Bitcoins, especially without raising alarm very quickly. The banking is very heavily regulated for this very reason and one of the selling points of Bitcoins is that it cannot be regulated.
Also think of the type of security your data center will require. I imagine most hosting companies are significantly easier to raid than your average bank.
Try to think of more decentralized solutions to the problem, building a big vault and stashing bits in it is so un-bitcoiny :)

Big of a delay compared to what? :)
Other than cash, there's currently no way to move money faster than with Bitcoins and you can't send cash over the Internet. Just look at how long it takes to get USD into Mt Gox for example! :)
Your Visa payment may seem instant, but the merchant doesn't get that money for quite a while. And that's if he's lucky - the payment can be reversed long after the product has been shipped / service provided. If I was a merchant, I'd take Bitcoins in a flash!
I predict soon we'll have organizations that will eliminate the confirmation delay by taking on the risk in exchange for a loss of anonymity and a small fee. This can be built on top of Bitcoin - I don't think there's a need to change the protocol.

I don't think straight up litecoin mining is a good idea - it's only helping them out. Now mining blocks with zero transactions and deliberately forking the chain as much as possible by trying to ignore blocks with transactions in them might be interesting! It would also benefit Bitcoins as a study of how such an attack would work (and what their defenses might be).
If anyone sets up an anti-litecoin mining pool, I'm certainly in with a whole bunch of GPUs! :)

Colored coins have nothing to do with taint, see: 
CCs sound like an interesting idea. Taint on the other hand is a mind meltingly stupid idea. Yeah, let's add a centralized system to reverse transactions of a decentralized currency whose main feature is not requiring trust in some third party.
It's like being presented with the first car, inspecting it carefully and concluding that we should remove that stupid, noisy combustion engine thingie and hook that thing up to a good horse.

I think people are defensive because alt-coins are perceived as one of the possible causes of failure of the crypto currency in general. For Bitcoin to be an effective vehicle for transferring value, it has to be worth quite a bit (and right now it's not yet enough for transactions over 10-100k USD).
This is why scarcity is part of the protocol and why the 'bits are worth nothing, anyone can create alt-coins' criticism has so much weight. If you are interested in crypto currency succeeding, I think it's logical to only pick one that you feel has the best chance and back it 100%. Hedging your bets over multiple alt-coins seems completely counterproductive. Therefore it's not really surprising that people supporting one type of coin would try to misinform those that might be interested in others.
There's also the argument that many of the alt-coins are parasitic in nature - they take the Bitcoin code and tweak few things that they perceive to be wrong with it without seemingly understanding that those things are part or a greater whole and are in fact required to make a viable crypto currency. Things like CPU only mining and faster block rate are great examples of attempts to address a problem that doesn't exist while making the protocol worse. The developers pushing those ideas are either not very smart or dishonest and hoping to make a quick buck - in neither case you should be using their software :). 
TLDR: There can only be one or zero successful crypto coins. If you want one, pick the likely winner. If you want zero, pick many alt-coins :)

Can you explain how? Let's say I have $100 cash that I want to get into some kind of crypto currency. Government shut down all the exchanges. What do I do?
As far as I can tell, Bitcoin already offers all the functionality and the military grade crypto that Hawala system needs to function online...

even they could have put everything on red and hold twice the amount of BTC at this point (said after the ball lands on red).

I am partial to a bit of hyperbole in the interest of humour, sadly that doesn't come across too well over the internet (or perhaps I'm just not as funny as I think :) ).
Your motivation is noble and I believe there have been isolated cases  where 'tainted' coins were successfully seized by an exchange but it's impossible to institutionalize such a system. As pointed out elsewhere - there would be no way to guard against fraudulent reports of taint while legitimate cases (backed by sufficient evidence to establish them as such) would be necessarily delayed enough for the criminals to launder the ill gotten coin. Of course people are free to choose to use taint if they like, but if they do - they will only end up punishing innocent people (who will then presumably choose not to deal with that person until they realize their taint system is futile).
So I guess I agree with you that the free market will sort things out, we just disagree on what the outcome will be :).

Hmm, how else could one phrase it... how about 'electronic frontier'? :P
Actually I don't really fault them for not taking Bitcoins yet, they have limited resources and there are ongoing assaults on our rights on many fronts. They have to pick their battles. What's silly is that they must have known this question will pop up when they do AMA - they should have at least prepared a polite non-answer.

In a gold rush, those selling shovels are likely making more money than the miners. This is even more true for Bitcoins. The protocol ensures that the coins are minted at a steady rate - if they chose to mine there is an impenetrable ceiling to their revenue. Furthermore the closer they'd get to 50% of hashing power, the more likely the price would crash to zero as the safety of the network could no longer be guaranteed. Fortunately it's unlikely they'd get anywhere near the 50% as they don't have monopoly on ASICs. They'd have to compete with other hardware, reducing the slice of that fixed pie even more.
On the other hand, there's no real limit to how much hardware they can sell. As the difficulty goes up, there will be a growing and insatiable need for more hashing power. Distributing the hashing power to as many people as possible will make the 51% attack less and less likely, driving the price of Bitcoin up too - giving existing miners capital to upgrade and drawing new miners in to buy their products. The hardware is pretty simple and now that they have the chips figured out, their margins will be really healthy.
TLDR: Selling shovels = lower risk + higher upside

Your math is missing the uncertainties. As a miner you're taking on multiple gambles - that the price of BTC remains high enough, that the difficulty won't rise too fast, etc. It takes time to get your $X+1 return over which there is a non-zero probability of something happening that will prevent the returns from materializing. When they sell their products (months before they're even finished), that's $X right in their pockets. They can use it to grow the company faster and make many times more $X which will make the +1 the miners make pale in comparison. Or buy a boat.

Oh, you're in for a treat! PBS/Mike Rugnetta really hit it out of the park with this channel. It's funny, smart and plugged directly into the hive mind. The quality varies but I found each episode sufficiently entertaining.

I see, but that's solving a different problem. I'm borrowing $100 instead of using my existing cash - with an obligation to meet in person at some point in the future to pay the debt.
What if I don't have an existing social network? What if the amount is greater than my network can provide? What incentive do people have to loan me money?
I can see potential use cases for Ripple if it had a critical mass of people using it but I see no incentive mechanism that will drive that critical mass (unlike Bitcoin where the earlier you participate, the more you stand to  gain - driving exponential adoption). Right now it's useless (barring the already mentioned case of selling of XRPs for a more useful crypto currency).
On the other hand, Bitcoin is useful now - I use it regularly to pay for things online, split lunch bill with friends, etc. It's fast enough and the claim that it's somehow less P2P than Ripple where Ripple is fully controlled by a single company and not fully open sourced is just ridiculous.
Ripplers keep asserting this magical distributed exchange functionality but fail to show any practical use case. If government bans exchanges - there won't be any exchanges that can act as bridges anyway so what's the point? It seems like smoke and mirrors to me... 
I am an open minded person, show me how I can do something with Ripple that isn't just an extra step over what I can do without it and I'll change my mind.

Unexpectedly smooth. Clicking the pay with Bitcoin button brings up this Coinbase page: 
I was already logged in to Coinbase as I checked my balance before my purchase so as soon as I clicked on 'Send using Coinbase.com account', the transaction was complete.
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:37:57
That's not really a use case for right now though - more a possible future scenario if the various government agencies decide to crack down on Bitcoin.
Even if that were to happen, I fail to see how Ripple adds value. To get fiat in and out you'll presumably have to use cash and exchange it physically in meatspace. If I have to chose between the Hawala contact giving me a Ripple IOU or Bitcoins - why on earth would I pick the IOU?? Why expose myself to more counterparty risk than necessary? I'm genuinely trying to grasp why anyone thinks Ripple is a good idea...

I was hoping that's the case - I was out all day so couldn't really investigate and I wanted to give people the heads up in case it was anything malicious. 
I still think the notification email should not have a link in it. One could easily spoof the email and trick you into logging in as well as entering your second factor authentication code.
As for how an attacker might get my address - mine was one of the hundreds leaked in the MtGox hack so I'm doubly suspicious of all Bitcoin emails :)
Lots of good safety tips in this thread btw and Coinbase - you rock! Best of luck with the insane scaling challenges as Bitcoin rockets ahead.

Eventually, yes. However at its current price, BTC is pretty much useless for the 'mainstream'. Let's say you want to buy yourself a new Bugatti Veyron and you want to use Bitcoins. At $16 / BTC you'd need to get your hands on over 140k BTC which is completely unfeasible (unless you are Satoshi). Quick check using the  calculator shows that buying that many Bitcoins would move the market to $100,000 / BTC! There just isn't enough depth in the market to buy anything... substantial :).
The sooner we reach 'useful' BTC price the better. Volatility will only attract more speculators and help disseminate the currency wider. We're still in the seeding phase of Bitcoin which by design harnesses the power of greed to spread far and wide and reach value that will make it a viable Internet currency. There will be many more bull and bear runs but as long as the long term trend is up - that's a good thing. The existing Bitcoin economy is pretty much all pegged to the dollar anyway so volatility right now is a non-issue.
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:24:37
Hmm, but miners don't actually create units of currency - they create a block of transactions and are rewarded by the system for doing so. One could argue that all the units of currency were already created the moment Satoshi published the protocol. :)
@_date: 2013-05-22 03:21:08
Is there an actual use case for Ripple right now? Does it solve a problem people have? If I want to get real USD in or out to buy/sell Bitcoins - I have to interact and trust some exchange whether I'm using Ripple or not, right? If that's the case, why even bother with Ripple?
Ripple getting popular is a non-issue if it doesn't actually do anything useful. Please correct me if I'm missing something.

The value of bitcoin won't drive the value of transaction fees. Fees serve two purposes - spam prevention and mining compensation. Spam / DDOS prevention requires each transaction to be worth some minimal amount to the sender before it starts being propagated through the network. This needs to be enforced by the protocol but as the value of the currency goes up, it can go down by the same ratio. It's up to the devs to keep on top of this. Alt chain brings nothing to the table here because if it would try to undercut the fees, it will get spammed to death.
Miner compensation is tied to how much work they have to do. Once the block reward goes to zero, it needs to be enough to make it worth their while to continue securing the chain. Again, this has nothing to do with the value of the currency and it depends on the difficulty and transaction volume. If the devs do their job right, the protocol will get out of the way here and let the market set the rates. The alt chain can only bring significantly reduced TX fees if it's running at significantly reduced difficulty while keeping up with the transaction volume or the main chain. The strength of the network effect (and lower value) will however result in alt chain having a much lower transaction volume, forcing miners to charge higher fees.
Basically Bitcoin clones have no chance of outperforming Bitcoin in TX fees and the snake oil benefits they advertise will not survive the test of free market. Significant benefits (that somehow Bitcoin devs were unable to roll into Bitcoin) are required to challenge Bitcoin's overwhelming network effect headstart.

Check out  - they offer both an online wallet and a merchant solution. It's getting pretty slick - especially for Coinbase to Coinbase transactions (yesterday I bought the Humble Bundle with Bitcoins and it was by far the smoothest online transaction I've ever experienced. Beats the pants of entering CC details or that ugly Paypal page).

If you pick your words from say 65,000 most common English words - each word is as good a password as 16 random bits. 20 random words is therefore as good as 16*20 = 320 bits. So that's actually a complete overkill because private keys used by Bitcoin are only 256 random bits. By using Bitcoin you're kind of already accepting that 256 bit random keys are long enough (and they are - there are 1000 time more possible private keys then there are atoms in the universe).

To answer the OP: Nobody knows. I like the ability of having access to some fraction of my net worth just by remembering a passphrase (in case bad things happen) and if my sentiment is shared by sufficient number of people then maybe. If you have a use for Bitcoins, use them. If you want to gamble, go put everything on red :D.

That's the beauty of it! Just note that the free market isn't some magical external force and we get to sit back passively until the winner is chosen. We are part of this market and our actions collectively matter.
My little contribution is to pay with BTC whenever possible and avoid parasitic alt-coins &amp; merchants that support them.

Not sure why you and byrd82 are getting downvoted, Bitcoin is not a trivial concept. 
Think of it as a public ledger of transaction. Transactions are distributed to everyone participating in the system via a peer to peer network (similar technology to BitTorrent). They're verified and recorded in this ledger called Blockchain using a proof of work scheme where people around the world commit computing power as a kind of an official stamp confirming batches of transactions. This is needed so that people aren't able to announce transactions that exceed the balance they actually have (double spending).
The technical details of the protocol are very neat but what actually makes Bitcoin special is that the incentives seem to be setup just right for it to work successfully as money. For example people confirming the transactions (miners) are rewarded proportionally to the amount of computing power they contribute - this forces them into a race of constantly improving their hardware, helping to secure the Blockchain. As they're compensated in Bitcoins they are likely to act in ways that will maximize their value by cooperating to improve the system and also by evangelizing to wider population. This is viral - people who acquire Bitcoins also gain these incentives.
The end result is online money not backed by any government. You can send it to anyone anywhere or carry it with you on a USB stick, smart phone or even just your brain. The system is still bootstrapping itself and many things could go wrong but if it continues to work as designed - it's kind of a huge deal.
