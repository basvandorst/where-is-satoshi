Like, good point.  That said, what do you think the courts are going to say?  That the exchanges DON'T need to turn over their information?

Ugh - thanks. Sorry about that!. : (

Yes, most of the time that works for stocks, but in my view bitcoin probably merits a price around $200, not the thousands that its trading for today.

Pretty much bitcoin profits are treated as capital gains by the IRS.  If you had held the cryptocurrency for less than a year, the sale is taxable as income tax; hold it for more than a year before selling it, you pay the capital gains tax rate, which is lower.  
Also, the IRS has won a couple of legal cases which say the major exchanges need to provide their profit data to the Feds, so its getting harder and harder for people to avoid capital gains taxes.

Can you PM me the details?

Danny, you're right. I'm getting off topic.  The bottom line here is that you can't evade the IRS, people need to report their BTC profits on schedule D on their tax forms.

Some good explanation of bitcoin volatility here - thought you guys would like it. 
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:16:07
Um, the whole point about bitcoin is that it is independent of governments.  Governments typically want to dilute the supply of money, bitcoin mitigates against that.

I would totally stay well away from Bitcoin until some of the froth clams down - at over $16,000 dollars per bitcoin, its looking overvalued to me.

Look, there is a lot of volatility in bitcoin right now...and quite frankly a LOT of first time bitcoin investors currently in the market.  It may seem self explanatory, but a lot of people don't know the basics about cryptocurrency.

Sweet, never considered this before.

I saw some people were looking around this info on the web.  To recap - there are some mail order pharmacies that will take bitcoin for prescription drugs, but you need to separate out the wheat from the chaff to find them. Oh, and you'll need a prescription. 
Thought you all would appreciate this.

Thats the one!

So much for the starving student stereotype: Apparently 1 in 5 financial aid recipients put the proceeds into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, according to the Student Loan Report.
This is based on a survey of 1,000 students that did not include any questions about the amount they invested — many could be buying small amounts. It’s also important to note that the survey didn’t appear to ask about the students’ motivation for buying cryptocurrencies. The students could actually have been using the digital currencies to pay for used textbooks on the Dark Web (thereby skipping the sales tax).

Okay, so its three things, right?
* regulation 
* a bubble effect 
* competing digital currencies 
I would add...declining demand in the face of lack of consumer adaptation for everyday purchases, such as buying food at the grocery store, paying rent, etc.  Most major banking institutions still don't have a bitcoin payment option.
