You were saying someone could be on the other side of a short (meaning: long) and that their reason would be hedging coins they hold.  All I'm saying is that going long futures does the opposite of hedging an existing long in the underlying.  It simple adds long exposure.  Someone would go short futures to hedge coins they have.

The only acceptable caveat in this case is to use a line of credit that you can cover by selling off other investments.  Say you have $100k in stocks and bonds and decide to use leverage to buy $20k of Bitcoin: if shit hits the fan you know the worst case scenario is you have to sell $20k of investments to pay down the line.  The great thing about leverage is you only have to weather the disruption of selling your stocks and bonds if you're wrong, whereas if you have no access to credit you have to sell $20k investments right out of the gate just to free up the capital.  Smart money uses covered leverage in endless permutations to generate more wealth.  Stupid money uses leverage to go into debt.

Someone hedging coins they hold would take the short position, not the long.  Someone would take the long if they wanted to lock in an a BTC price (i.e. price goes up: win from futures contract, price goes down, lose from futures contract but get to buy bitcoin at the lower price).
