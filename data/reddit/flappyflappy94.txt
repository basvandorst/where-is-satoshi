You're forgetting about the cost to run the network.  The credit card's ~2% merchant fee covers both the liability protection and the network itself.  The Bitcoin network currently costs 3600 Bitcoins per day to run.  When the inflationary period ends, those costs will have to come from somewhere, presumably transaction fees.  Since transaction fees are agnostic of the amount spent, this will make smaller transactions much more expensive, relatively speaking.

What personal information is getting stolen between the swipe and the payment processor?  How does an insured transaction require all this trust?
Edit:  Shill for what, economics?  Take off your tinfoil hat, I'm a business major.  You should go to business school, you might learn how to make a defensible argument.

Instead of whining, why not try to improve your situation? Put up a BTC donation address and maybe people will help you out?

This argument makes no sense.  The credit card company controls the network and provides liability protection:  if someone steals the card information from their network, it doesn't cost you anything.  You don't have to "trust" anything.

Or you could have just, you know, closed your bank account when you left the country like a normal person.

Yes, let's replace Visa/Mastercard with Bitpay.  What a great idea.

I didn't tell him to believe what I said because of my credentials, I was simply responding to his assertion that I'm part of the Illuminati.  I'd be perfectly happy to speak only to the facts, if he was able to.

And you think Bitcoin is free?  The network costs 150 Bitcoins per hour plus transaction fees.  For that money, consumers get zero fraud protection just better encryption against man in the middle attacks.

How so?  I'm guessing they'll look exactly the same.

So you just travel the world, opening bank accounts and leaving money in them?  Like Johnny Appleseed, but with cash instead of apples.

The good thing about Bitcoin is that the transaction takes so long to confirm that you have time to really get to know the seller and decide if he's trustworthy.  With a stupid credit card it's verified within like a second, you barely have time to chat.
