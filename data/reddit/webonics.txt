The government could probably force them to turn over the companies assets, which they could challenge, which could place the assets in limbo and explain why no one is rushing to prove solvency.

Holy shit, I hadn't even considered this as a possibility for the delay.
That would be so depressing.

The FBI has been known to seize or create underworld digital communities and run them internally, even facilitating criminal activity, to gain knowledge of the networks and operation of what ever criminal activity they're investigating.

They have ways around that. If Mark is a United States citizen, they may be able to pressure him. Someone else said Mt. Gox is incorporated in Delaware. They're heavily related to financials or operating close enough to control. They may have assets here that could be seized. They require the cooperation of the existing financial industry, which the United States could make neigh impossible.
The unfortunate point here, is that if the United States Government woke up this morning and wanted to gain or seize control of Mt Gox, they probably could have done it with a Judges signature by lunch.
I imagine Mt Gox is bending over in cooperating hoping they'll be allowed to retain their company and "technical problems" is a stalling tactic.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:13:49
They wouldn't have to. They could have gained control or enough leverage via terrorism or drugs to force Mt Gox into full cooperation.
At which point, Mt Gox prays to all relevant Gods they hurry up, while telling the rest of us they're having technical difficulties.
They may not be proving solvency or moving the money because there's no reason to prove solvency while they don't have control, and they don't want to make any moves which would incur backlash.
Not saying you're wrong, because who knows. But if I had to put my money somewhere, I'd say the US Government has them by the balls while they're hoping to cooperate and make that temporary.
You can bet there's 1000 ways the US Government could have made life terrible for Gox, and they could have employed any of them for any reason under the pretense of drugs and turrism.

That was pretty fair of you.

Yes, this is much better than centralized control.
Right guys?
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:56:26
The only way I see this as a possibility is if the Government somehow attempted to covertly seize control of or access to the exchange for such a purpose as you state, and Mt Gox has raised challenges to those seizures which are being fought in secret court rooms right now, resulting in this delay of service.
That would explain why these funds haven't moved, and why they won't discuss it as anything more than technical problems. 
They're "temporarily unavailable" and "not lost yet" until the legal battle plays out.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:58:04
Here's where my money lies - They're fighting a court order to take over or control the company in some manner. As such, the companies assets are largely frozen until the legality of the order is determined. No one can talk about this, because there is a gag order on the initial order being contested.
All of the language indicates an immovable force outside of Gox with the vast sort of leverage on them one would only expect from a Government.
I just refuse to believe that they lost keys. Not because I have some high opinion of the company, I just don't want to accept that stupidity on that level would be so pervasive. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:15:33
There could be any number of reasons the U.S. wants unfettered access to an exchange. Especially Gox and their records.
The SR seizure may have provided the public legal justification to get that control, whether or not it was the private internal reason. Once they have access to all of the information, they will use it for intel or any other purpose they may have planned. There could be a separate larger justification than the SR evidence. 
And now they've leaned leverage against Gox, who is probably hoping to cooperate fully and completely, in the hopes that the Government leaves them a company and industry standing when it's over.

Come on I'm with you guys, but let's be reasonable. Stop Downvoting this dude for pointing out the bank still holds non-liquid assets just because he pointed out something that's makes the bank look less evil and doesn't portend that Bitcoin is the financial messiah.
Yes this is why banks and the current financial system sucks.
Yes this is an advantage of Bitcoin.
But it's still true the bank still holds all of its non-liquid capital investments and assets. The statement is factually accurate, the bank  presumably has the assets to cover its deposit balances by a wide margin they're simply not in a liquid form.
If we're going to engage in discussions of why Bitcoins may be a preferable currency, then we should begin that discussion with the ability to acknowledge facts....

Dude, I'm with you on this to no end. One of the major problems with the United States today is that decisions are rarely made upon factors other than profit and money.
"I believe that XYZ, but if you give me enough money, I can put all of my personal beliefs aside, and further the opposite cause because, well, I'm a sad sad human being....with no moral fiber or spine...."
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:32:48
Wow, that was incredibly interesting.
United States Government agencies are fairly proficient at operating underworld communities and have demonstrated this ability in the past.
It's possible that if they were able to somehow justify this to a court, which in my opinion would be incredibly easy considering the nature of the courts lately, that Mt. Gox has out right been taken from them, or such was threatened barring all but absolute cooperation in an investigation.










I bet it's not.
To me this indicates that they can't access their Bitcoins, and even if they could, it would do no good.
The language is so cryptic, evasive, and vague that it indicates they're legally barred from discussing something.
If I had to bet, I would say that temporarily, control of the exchange has somehow been taken from them, and they are hoping "technical difficulties" will suffice until they get it back.
Interested to see where this goes.

They just did. Did you even read the article? The dude wouldn't even talk to them. His own family doesn't know if he created Bitcoin. He apparently has 400 million dollars and hasn't accessed it....all we have to go in is hearsay of what was allegedly said.
They have just placed a private individual at the had of a multibillion dollar empire intricately tied to criminal activity, theft, a global financial system in and of itself, and they can't prove they have the right guy. 
However, that didn't stop them from speculating he has 400 million dollars, naming his family members, providing his location, and the fact that he lives in a modest home, drives a silver Toyota corolla, likes model trains, etc etc etc.
They just created a fucking nightmare for this dude, and there's no evidence he's even the right guy.

It sets a precedent that the Bitcoin Foundation has the authority to alter, to the benefit of certain powerful entities, the fundamental supply of Bitcoins.
If the coins are lost, those with them are in a better place through no wrong doing of their own. If they're recovered via a central authority, those peoples position will be reduced to the benefit of someone who did something incredibly stupid.
That seems a lot like the scenario bitcoin is trying to move away from. What do you think?

I want to laugh at you...but instead, let me help you.
The next time you have a weekday off, head down town to your local district court. Pop on in, and listen to a day of "motion to suppress" hearings. Ask around, you can get into them and sit quietly during the proceedings.
You will hear some of the most insane and ridiculous lies and bullshit you've ever heard, and then you will watch a judge rubber stamp acceptance on it.
If you believe the courts give a fuck about the constitution in this country, then you simply haven't spent enough time in a court room...
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:37:49
That's exactly how I read it.
It wouldn't matter if they got the money and proved solvency.
I would bet they've either lost control of the exchange temporarily, or are doing every thing they can to cooperate so that the don't.

The United States does not care about that.
They can justify seizure or control to a US judge via some tangentially related drug or terrorism connection for sure.
All they would have had to do is want it, and apparently that time has come.
Of course I don't agree and believe that's ridiculous, but it wouldn't have taken half a days work to make a case that would meet the totally non existent burden of proof some of these judges have been requiring in the United States lately.
More interesting to me, anyone have any ideas on what motives the U.S. may have in doing this? Public vs Private motives?

Yup, this is how it would go down:
"Bitcoins were used as a means by which to facilitate unregulated untraceable criminal activity in multiple currencies across the globe. The coins held by the United States Government were seized in relation to a criminal investigation and will remain as evidence in the hands of the United States Government."
In the unlikely case that this circumstance is prophetic, I feel like I should say that in some cases if you feel your property has been wrongfully seized, you are required to file motions within a certain time frame to that effect. Otherwise your property is considered forfeit.
So if the Government seizes bitcoins in relation to this and you have a lot at stake, call a lawyer immediately.

I would take my chances with a group of laymen who aren't sure about the law over one expert that willfully perverts it; but your point is sadly taken.
Sort of tangentially related, but that was a great article. Grand Juries have always bothered me, if you can't convince a grand jury to indite, when only your side is told, you may as well hang it up.
Also, what I said about Judges? Yeah, it's right there in that Supreme Court decision. Almost nothing in a criminal case should exist "beyond challenge" because that gives the state safe havens to hide behind and cripple the defense.
Now that you can challenge the seizure of funds, then a prosecutor and an officer can manipulate the story and facts ever so slightly to lead the jury in the direction of forfeiture.
Even if they bend or break the law, you're going to have a difficult time making a case against them for it and paying for your existing case, since *all of your funds have been seized and that seizure cannot be challenged.*
It seems unlikely to me that the Supreme Court would be unaware of these circumstances which are detrimental to the rights of the accused....and yet here we are.

I'm just impressed they got charged really. Government agents commit massive crimes across this country every day, and we see charges far too rarely, and when we do, we usually see sentencing far below the average.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:13:04
The fact of the matter is, crimes committed by government agents are prosecuted at much lower rates than the general public.
If the only thing keeping someone from breaking the law is their own conscience, you'll see much higher rates of criminal behavior, as we currently do in the government.

That's not entrapment dude. Entrapment is "Committing a crime you wouldn't have otherwise committed".

If it turns out things are as you say, it is good for the case, but its likely not because of entrapment.

LoL, they're similar in that both are blatantly complicit in illegal behavior, the government knows this, has evidence of this, except one was allowed to buy their way out while the other is going to jail.
I'll go ahead and defend my comment so you can't spew shit, as I know you defenders of oligarchy love to do so frequently. I can't help but notice you have yet to answer any of the pleas below for further explanation.
The banks knowingly and consciously sent assets they knew were bad to certain credit rating agencies they were in collusion with, to have them rated as AAA, they then knowingly and purposefully sold these assets, which they knew were shit, as AAA in many different forms all over the fucking globe. Mortgage backed securities.
The SEC has evidence that individuals within the banks *knew* their assets were shit, and *knew* the credit rating agencies were rating them as AAA despite that fact, therefore, in short, they *knew* they were committing fraud. They *knew* they were profiting from that fraud, and they *knew* that in due time, others were going to be hurt by that fraud. Further evidence of this last mens rea is indicated by their *investing in such against what would have been their interest had they believed their assets were genuine*. However, this is only supporting evidence, the SEC has text messages in which employees and members of these banks openly admit to their crimes.
So we *know* for a fact, that people within these banks knew *for a fact* they were engaged in a criminal enterprise.
Now go ahead and tell us why those people aren't in jail because it's all so very different.
I must be one of those idiots you're talking about.
