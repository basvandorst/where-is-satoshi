I think that "sturdy" is also too strong word ;p

It'll go up, according to the statistic analysis. We can't predict the unpredictable, so we can't say much, only that according to the cycle analysis it'll grow ;p

Unfortunately the current regulations across the globe are making you pay taxes from your income - it's understandable, but unfortunate ;/

I don't think that hodling Bitcoin is illegal in India, there is something with the banks and currency which won't allow you buy some. It's better to travel somewhere where you won't get chased for it and use ATM or exchange or website like [buycoinnow.com]( \- it would probably be even cheaper than buying from some strangers at meetups or from darknet

Chinese gov: "CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!"

It's absolutely crushing and overwhelming for me that there is such a beautiful way to handle transactions between people like Bitcoin, we've got blockchain and this technology and idea built around it is losing with aspiration of modern authorities to create a society based on mass surveillance - Bitcoin is completely opposite and it's taken down by regulations which are always saying that "it's for your safety". Guess what, it's not for safety reasons, it's just because someone wants you and your children to become a slave of the system.

Yep, [buycoinnnow.com]( is really a decent way to buy btc, especially if you don't have an account on any crypto exchange. It's just a regular cryptocurrency payment processor, safe and fast transactions. I think it's better than localbitcoins for example, because there is always a risk of a being hoaxed ;/

With combination of coindeal entering the US market this is a great news for their upcoming users

You're right, btc didn't crashed - all in all, last week was tremendous, but the prices of other projects are falling extremely too. Not everyone is going to be satisfied after june

CoinDeal, they are just entering the US market and the trading is not available in all states yet, but it's one of the best platforms in Europe with promising development. Soon they will fully enter the us and in addition to that they are giving away their own token - by staking it you can lower your fees drastically.

Turkish football must be very popular there. Quite interesting

Even though Yeni Malatyaspor Club is a pretty new team in the Turkish football, they've managed to achieve the 5th position last season. I don't think they will manage to enter European or Champions League next season due to very tight competiton, but imo the local brand exposure is still at very high level
