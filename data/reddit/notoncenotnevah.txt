I agree with others that it'll drop down to a low of \~8k, then make a few jumps here n there gaining towards 16k by October. 
Very curious as to what 2020 will bring for Bitcoin

Bisq is P2P
Binance doesn't require KYC. Use a VPN if you're in a restricted country or concerned with privacy. 
Also use switch between Monero if you're trying anonymize your coins before/after trading on Binance/other markets

I discovered btc mid-late 2011 i believe. Wasn't mining it.
Over the course of a year or so started really considering investing 250-500$ and just setting it aside to see what would happen. In that span I had seen bitcoin go up a decent amount, but I each time convinced myself that being young, I needed that money put to better use. I didn't have any experience trading, I wasn't much of a 'tech' person. 
That's easily the greatest regret of my life. 
I rationalize by telling myself I probably would've sold off around \~$1,000 missing out on making buku money. 
Or losing my private keys all together.
This january I finally got my confidence and my mind right after a year+ long shitty relationship. Started being more active not just socially but in persuing old dreams as well. 
Noticed Bitcoin seemed to be doing a bit of stabilizing, a girl I  dated was tired of hearing me bitch about missing out on "the bitcoin boom" and convinced me that If I still believe it has a ways to go before its really peaked, then its not too late. I've been actively trading as well spending a lot of my time studying/learning and this year I've done pretty well in crypto!
Be Skeptical, but don't be a pessimist!
Take Risks, but don't be a Fool!
