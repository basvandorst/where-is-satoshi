I mean, you have to put it into perspective, what’s the normal life span supposed to be? 8 years? And let’s say it cuts it’s life in half down to 4 years, we’re you going to upgrade the card in 4 years anyway? And what’s its value when it dies? A 4 year old card doesn’t have much value anyway, and if he’s making 365 dollars a year, after a couple years it paid for the card anyway?

Realistically, prob about 8% or so to cover the fees from buying/selling. Anything over that it gravy.

Since everyone said it but didn’t explain it. Dollar cost average is what you described as putting 50 dollars a week. It makes it so you average out the highs and lows rather than trying to buy low with a lump sum, or buying high with the lump sum. 
Historically speaking, there’s no point in recent time you would have not made money by buying 50 dollars a week over a 2 month period. The first few weeks gains would cancel out losses from buying at a peak that crashed down soon after. Or vise versa. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:02:42
Both. CPU isn’t going to make much at all, but it will make something and it’s there anyway, so might as well use it too.

Serious answer:
Inflation is when more money is added to circulation, like printing more money then you are destroying. 
Inflation would stop, miners would switch to only verifying transactions. Bitcoin is designed for this to take place approximately year 2140. New coins rewarded for mining are “halved” (the amount rewarded cut in half) at set blocks to reach this goal. The last halving was last year.

The best way is probably a direct buy from someone. Localbitcoins is an outlet for buyers and sellers, though I have never used it, so can’t really speak for it. You may try your cities subreddit? Find a seller willing to trade for cash at a coffee shop or something. I assume since you are younger you wouldn’t be investing thousands anyway. Or, you find a older friend to make a buy for you and then transfer to you. None of these are exactly ideal, but better than nothing I suppose.

You pretty much got the basics.
If you plan to sell it any time soon, might not want to transfer back and forth because the fees are high right now and you’ll lose money every time you transfer.

So in number 2, you transferred your coins off the exchange a personal wallet. 
For number 3 you are simple going to send them back to the exchange, there will be a receive or fund option on the exchange, where it will give you an address to send to, your wallet will have a send option, so you will send from there to the address that the exchange gives you to receive at. The exchange will let you sell the bitcoins for usd or whatever the currency is in your country, and then you can send that money to your bank account. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:14:59
If you send 10 bucks it’s probably still 15 bucks in fees. A year ago it would have been less than a dollar. 
Even still, 15 dollars to move 600 is a lot. If I sell an item to someone on Craig’s list for 600 bucks cash, neither of us pay a fee and it’s as instant as handing the money from one hand to the other. Bitcoin is supposed to replace cash, so paying anything but pennies in transfer fees is not going to help that happen, and taking an hour means if I want to buy something with it, I need to stick around to insure it transfers. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:40:01
What older forks? From bitcoin? Bitcoin Cash was the first. Then bitcoin gold, and bitcoin diamond or something possibly coming. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:20:43
The miners verify the transaction, there’s a small cost involved with this. It should have clearly outlined that when you transferred, you probably just didn’t notice.  It’s part of how miners make money.

Hello sir,
What about some sort of a keychain? Like the bitcoin symbol. I would like getting that. Off the top of my head you could either do a actual solid block B, or engrave the symbol into a circular piece. That would be pretty neat and maybe strangers might ask about it, helping spread the word lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:15:22
Not really Coinbase fee, it’s miner fee. We all agree there is a problem right now with high fees. Watching lightning network or something to work this out. It’s the current growing pain in bitcoin.

When you set up the Nano s, it will give you a recovery phrase to write down, they even give you a card to write it down on, and after they will ask what words went in what order to ensure you have it right. If you ever lose, or damage the physical unit, you will have the back up seed phrase to get recover your wallet. It’s best practice to not keep the seed phrase and unit in the same place for this reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:18:21
You using the bch wallet on your actual ledger? You need to use the setup app to add a bch app to the ledger, then open the bitcoin app in chrome, click split at the bottom, sounds like you already got that half covered.

Sorry, your post was deleted so I can’t see. What’s your graphics card? In my case I have a 1080ti and make about 5 dollars in bitcoin a day and spend 75 cents on the electricity to do so

When you make a wallet, part of a wallet is a “seed phrase” it’s a backup in case you lose your physical wallet. A “paper wallet” is simply writing down the seed phrase on a piece of paper(it’s a bunch of specific words in a specific order generated by the wallet) so some people write down the seed phrase on a paper, then erase the physical wallet. They safely store the piece of paper till they are ready to move the bitcoin then use the words on the paper to “recover” a wallet.

The large exchanges are businesses and need to adhere to the know your customer regulations, that’s why they need id, they also have fraud protection. I would be weary of sites that don’t require info, they may be scams. The only option that meets your requirements is localbitcoins, where you need to set up a direct exchange between you and another individual.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:24:31
I feel like Coinbase I just sent a pic of my ID, quad wanted pic of ID, pic of you holding your ID, a bill with your address on it, and they manually verify which could take a few days to a week. QuadrigaCX is a great site though and worth the hassle. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:08:37
In my opinion, anything over 500USD. 
Taking into account something like a leger nano s is like 50 bucks, how much do you think you think your holdings need to be worth to justify spending that much? Clearly not like 100 bucks. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:19:24
I gifted my dad 10 dollars in bitcoin earlier this year with a 1 dollar transaction fee, now that 10 is worth 80, and could buy a decent steak dinner, so why not buy small amounts. I started by buying 25 dollars here and 50 there pretty much like buying lottery tickets and it turned out ok for me. But that’s just me. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:41:38
I used  to change some litecoin for Bitcoin and it went fine. I don't leave any currency on exchanges though. You won't find one that doesn't take a small cut though. But it was reasonable, A couple bucks on a few hundred dollars. To put it in perspective though, banks or currency exchange charge a lot more. People complain about fees. But they exist to make money, they have to charge for a service. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:21:14

Do you have a smart phone? An iPhone or android? There's a few different wallets available for free, like breadwallet. You simply send it from the exchange to your wallet on your phone and now it's your money. You get a 12 word "passphrase" that acts as a backup in case you lost your phone or something. 
Though big exchanges seems very safe, you never know for sure, they could freeze your account and you are SOL, so could a bank, look at Greece.  Think of a exchange like a bank, and a wallet like.. a leather wallet in your pocket.

It's a little USB dongle that holds your coins offline. Some people use a spare iPod touch too. Personally, I think I would need to be holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin to warrant that level of security. It's a personal choice though. You are probably fine on coinbase, since you just started, I doubt you have much, (and by much I mean thousands.) though there has been incidents in the past of similar services being "hacked" and people loosing their bitcoins. You could also use an app like breadwallet for apple products that acts as a wallet as well, but it could be problematic if your phone was stolen I suppose. 
Remember that there are presumably people in this sub that for example bought 100 dollars worth of Bitcoin when it was at 50 cents, and are now sitting on 200k+ I can see not wanting to walk around with that on my phone. If only I had bought some back then.. hindsight is 20/20.

I haven't used it for an in store purchase per say. But when I have used it on steam, newegg, and to gift a friend, using the qr code and my iOS breadwallet, it was instant. I would Assume that it would be a similar situation where you scan a qr code with a smartphone wallet? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:15:29
Honestly, it's always a good time since it always trends up. Look at a 1 year chart, hell, look at a 1 month chart. Now if you bought today, what will it be in 1 year from now?  If you see the crazy daily changes, they even out in a month. You don't put money in a retirement savings and then check it in 3 hours. How often do you check the value of your home country's fiat currency? Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme, it's not a commodity. It's a currency.

My wild drunk theory: "Insiders" found out it was to be approved, started making many million dollar buys of Bitcoin. They think they are being sneaky, and their greed overpowers them. They watch the price sky rocket. "Shit" they think, "we are smarter than this" they start to sell all those big buys, with profit mind you, to crash the price, and rebuy the now on sale Bitcoin right before approval. Classic hedge fund fuckover.

It would undoubtably bring more people into the bitcoin market as it would be seen as more legitimate. If it gets denied, the get rich quick people will get scared and panic sell, akin to drops seem by scared Chinese investors every time a tweet goes out.

Coinbase is good. Very simple and easy. The verification is a pain but it makes them more legitimate for banks to allow your funds to go to them. You can move your coins to your own wallet on your phone, I like bread wallet for this. And I don't know how much you wanted to buy, but if you get up into a larger sum, in my opinion, anything over let's say 500 dollars, then investing in a hardware wallet is a good idea. My preference is the leger nano s.
