Yes.  Still too much time with too many available bitcoins.  We have to see what happens when demand starts to outpace supply more.
Look to volume and diversity of volume to see what's going to happen long term.  Also look at things like varying usage.  For instance, how much remittance business does it start to get.  How many contractual type exchanges start to occur on the blockchain as with this latest Nasdaq news.  Another thing I think we'll see eventually is colored coins being used for local towns.  That will be very interesting.  
This thing really is just starting man.

Well we both know the truth will come out in time.  Just remember if if it starts making a run toward 10k after 2016 and it crashes back to 3 or 4k don't make the same mistake next time.

Same thing has happened again and again.  It's not dying.  There was publicity before the last run up YOU just weren't aware of it.  Wait until next year.  If it starts going above 1000 again the same hype cycle will occur again and then it will "die" again, etc. etc.

I'm sorry but you're simply being silly.  I doubt you got involved in bitcoin until this year or last.  If you had, you would have known there have been a TON of articles the WHOLE time.  A simple google search is all it takes to confirm this.  You're probably just "feeling" bad about an investment you thought was just an instant ticket to riches.

It's done this since the start.  I don't see anything different.  A good test will be 2016 when the mining reward halves.  If you don't start seeing more upward price pressure then you could start saying that.

The end of 2017.  Honestly even then I wouldn't lose hope.  As long as it maintains good volume, increasing awareness and variety of adoption there are hopes for the currency.  It's a fits and starts thing that's not going to happen on anyone's schedule in my opinion.  Persistence and consistency is a hell of a thing though.
I will be concerned though if after 2017 it hasn't reached near 1000.
