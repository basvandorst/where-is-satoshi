Dahm why would they even post this? It would have been better for their reputation to just stay out of this thread altogether.
I will NEVER use Bitwala again

You have been scammed. There is no way to spend or do anything with this money, it is in someone else possession and you are just looking at the value of how much they have

What is wrong with anti-nationalism?
People say Bitcoin will take on the government and banks, but in the same breath support nationalism? You realize that anything that opposes banks and government also opposes nationalism? Bitcoin is borderless, it is permissionless, and it is stateless. By definition Bitcoin is anti-nationalist

Yeah I purposely mixed my own coins to obscure the original addresses, and then deleted the old private keys.
I just couldn't stomach looking at my 2011 transactions and seeing how close I came to being obscenely rich.

There's no evidence he helped any Nazis. That's a right wing conspiracy theory spouted by crazies like Alex Jone.
He took on the banks and won, and then devoted most of his life to charity, but being Jewish and rich means he's the target of a bunch of anti-semitism.

I love Bitcoin but this has a very high chance of being the worst decision of your life
@_date: 2019-10-30 08:27:03
This doesn't "perfectly explain" anything other than your lack of economic understanding.
Bitcoin is amazing for what it is. We don't need to bring conspiracies into it.

I was also shafted by Wickr after finding a critical bug that allowed me to grab anyones phone and find their entire chat history from Wickr outside of the application.
Wicked denied it was even a bug as the vulnerability came through the phones keyboard input system, and then silently fixed the issue in a later release.
If you find a bug in a product like this you are better off just exploiting it.

Not all P2P sites have a quick sell scam system. Checkout LocalCoinSwap and Paxful
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:20:22
Bitcoin P2P. No KYC. About to implement non-custodial wallet systems in the next few months. Has every single feature offered by LocalBitcoins with a better user experience.

It sounds like many people you lack a financial education.
I'm going to be blunt here: you probably shouldn't invest ANY money in crypto unless it's a very tiny play-around figure.
You are the kind of person who would benefit most just from speaking to a financial advisor who also has a fiduciary duty to you (they legally must act in your best interests). You should ask about building a retirement fund, how to manage index funds and bond investments, and so on.
Bitcoin is not for paying off college debts and your retirement fund. It's the highest level of high risk investments out there (apart from shitcoins). Don't put a dollar in any crypto without accepting the very likely possibility you will lose 100% of your investment.
Better luck next time, please take this as a life lesson.

No verification or KYC, user friendly, plenty of sellers on P2P network and has been in operation for some time
@_date: 2019-10-11 22:32:54
But you could defeat this really easily. Just create random similar spikes in traffic between blocks? I mean it would be enough just to run multiple nodes for a few different cryptos on the same connection

P2P is the best way to get around restrictive governments as you can use any type of payment method

Wallets can never be deleted so isn't it always at an all time high?

I'm a Bitcoin fan but respectfully I have to disagree with this argument.
Although anyone can create altcoins they have value through developer contributions, like other open-source projects.
For example you could clone ETH, but it would be meaningless unless you could also convince the thousands of developers on the project to instead contribute to your altcoin.
Over time more and more developer activity further entrenched the value of the software, like we see with the Linux operating system. Once total developer time gets to a certain threshold it actively discourages new entrants and devalues other projects who now face barriers to entry.
I actually see developer contributions as being more important than hash power. Miners just want to make money, and will always just go where it's most profitable. It's the developers who drive the technology forward.
Right now Bitcoin has the most development activity, and the biggest ecosystem - and thus is the most valuable. But we must never get lazy and forget that Bitcoin also needs constant work and improvements just like other projects, in order to stay in the top spot
