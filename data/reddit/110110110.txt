This is great for bitcoin. I feel like zynga are doing this for nefarious reasons. Free to play games tend to get lots of charge backs due to kids stealing mommies credit card etc etc. Bitcoin makes that impossible. 
The teens of the future are going to have a way harder time remembering daddy's private keys instead of just a 16 digit number.

You end up paying more for electricity than you get mining, yes. But in this scenario, the miner's computer is already on (playing a game or watching a video). So there should be little-none extra electricity used. As long as 
*coins mined by the distributed system (x)* &gt; 
*cost of running content server and obtaining the content (y)* &gt; *cost of mining x coins using dedicated hardware (z)*
Then it should be an effective means of receiving payment for content. If you're worried about hardware burning out, you could always limit the % usage, lowering x, as long as x &gt; y &gt; z still holds true.

Mt Gox is higher priced because there have been issues in the past with getting money (USD) out of there. This means that the ask price is generally higher due to the risk sellers take. 
You could (and people do) buy on the cheaper exchange and sell on a more expensive one, but the problem is that it takes days, weeks or even months to get USD out of exchanges so unless you would need to have extra money in the cheaper exchange to restock on coins (which is another risk in itself). So pretty much you need to have a lot of capital to begin with to do this (it is still risky).
Also if you're doing it manually, you have to be faster than a computer. Because there are computer programs waiting for the price differences to be 'worth it' and immediately buy up the cheap coins and sell elsewhere.
It's called [Arbitrage]( and it's pretty risky is you don't know what you're doing.

Depends on your e-commerce plugin you're using on wordpress. If you're using woocommerce you could use something like this without changing code:

Honestly, if its just small transactions like that you could just absorb the cost. You are paying it anyway when you fork out for visa/mastercard fees (plus the risk of chargeback). Coffee is pretty low risk anyway.

Amazon are pretty draconian. I would need to make new accounts for all 3 gift receivers and even then kindles can only be connected to one account which means they couldn't use their own account. And as I said in OP, amazon.com.au doesn't even have gift cards yet (this is mentioned deep in the help section I found). Clearly books arent at the stage of music in terms of freedom from DRM yet. I guess I'll join a private tracker for ebooks until then.

Withdrawals of fiat have to go through the banking system which is in no way instant. Banks tend to flag transactions and freeze high volume transactions related to bitcoin for money laundering checks. Withdrawing usd from an exchange and depositing into another isn't quick enough to take advantage of arbitrage without huge risks.
