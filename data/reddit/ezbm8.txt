I mean... You hear it, because :
a) People that didn't invest get mad, and just repeat it.
b) People that have no idea just repeat what is said around.
c) People actually talk sense.
You could get mad at c), because I join one of them, but I will explain you why.
Imagine, that you are an investor. Actually one, that rethinks every single thing about thing hes going to invest in. Let's say that you have two possibilites to put your money on. Gold and Bitcoin.
Bitcoin. Nothing but a code. It is expensive, but you don't know for how long, because like said, it is just a code. Nothing else. You can't touch it, can't smell it, can't use it for real life purposes (but paying, but you don't know for how long).
Bitcoin's demand is created just by the fact, that there is already big demand for it. Doesn't it already sound dumb? I mean, demand being the only factor is kinda risky investment.
Now we come to gold. It doesn't cost as much, but you can use it. As decoration, in electricity, it has many purposes in reality, not only valuable as a currency (no idea if u can call both bitcoin and gold a currency, but anyways).
Not hating. Anyone who invested into bitcoin, whether its hype or they analysed it, got his own nice amount of money earned. But I wouldn't buy anymore bitcoins anymore, and sell mine as fast as I possibly can. But it is just me, can't really tell others what to do, might only suggest.
As small investor (sorry if I am wrong, but in most cases people don't own more than several bitcoins), you can never be sure how the price will go. There are people with thousands of bitcoins, that can simply sell all their coins and make price crash.
