I'm a fucking dishwasher/parent going to school full time so your god damn right I'm greedy about making enough money to quit my job and be able to focus on school so I can have enough time to study and get an A in bio instead of a C. It has become a bit of an unhealthy obsession though I must admit. I just hate my job so much and feel like I'm so close
to being able to quit its all I think about. I just want to have enough time to do well in school, not doing other peoples dishes for 40 hours a week.
