Well why would it do that? Like there is probably. A little dip but not that much...

Well. your last sentence is basically what is the rule of btc investing, except for maybe when recent actions take place, e.g. when all those wall street idiots sayed btc has no future and a lot of people thought that was true. with recent actions, when you know that they are happening/they have happened, you can sometimes predict btcs near future...

Haha now we are down. **welcome to the btc rollercoastet!!** only idiots invest in btc short time...

Well, i am not quite sure if i understood you right(haha, not been here for too long).
so you are saying, bch will dip/crash (because of coinbases bch integration)? why do many people say otherwise? Isnt BCH like allready kinda segwit2x but with more popularity?
So i guess btc will probably rise even further???

i was lucky, lurking around on reddit. I think for the others it might be fellow traders, twitter and maybe some kind of news app???
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:37:48
wow, just wow. haha i am sitting here with 0,03 btc, will buy 0,1 probably soon...

Well that is a thing that probably dipped tha price atm. But in the a little longer term(5h to a week) this might also rise the price as it means that btc will not get replaced too soon...
