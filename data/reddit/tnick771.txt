I still haven't seen these fees? Fee for me to cash out of coinbase is $14.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:14:04
Get out now if you can’t stomach the risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:44
You lose out on the gains from that 1k
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:44:06
You convinced me!
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:29:25
its gone past 16k like 8 times today.
This is just trying to get clicks on your stupid site. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:26:44
Eventually you’ll owe money for holding bitcoin. Look for negative USD by Jan
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:17:29
The broken English tells me you’re telling the truth.

Why would anybody give anybody a $1,500 iTunes gift card. This smells so fishy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:26:13
Who knows. If you’re nervous get out until after it goes live?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:57:49
Honestly it'll be treated as a digital commodity. I do not see it ever replacing USD.
I'm terrified as to what WS will do if it has the power to short. The price will go up because of the premium price needed to bet, but after the price gets heavy with contracts I don't want to speculate how it'll pan out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:45
How stupid are you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:17:36
I sent you 2.5 BTC
Enjoy your lambo
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:37:12
Dipped like $1k briefly 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:00:20
Futures trading is making me nervous.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:15:15
.com bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:51:16
Services taking advantage of the rush.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:29:54
Wowww this is a big dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:37:49
Your friend = you
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:26:38
Not that magnitude at all
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:00:16
The events of the last 24 hours are pretty unprecedented. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:28:46
The thing is nobody will know. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:54:15
Price will go back to normal acceleration 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:45:27
I would expect that from any server under that much stress. It's a risk you take when you use a service instead of an actual exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:33:01
I don't get all the coinbase hate. I looked at how much commission it would cost for me to cash out and it's only $14 still
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:35:01
Save your money. Be smart. Don't start risky behavior at such a young age.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:51:31
I’m only seeing $14 fees...
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:33:38
is for you then
We need this after yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:15:17
Still trying to figure out how to completely cash out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:33
Begging is stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:05:17
It’ll correct to where WS thinks it should be. I would wager it dips to 11
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:12:46
Anxiety fueled posts. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:54:40
no... This is "normal" compared to this week
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:01:32
Shorting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:50:09
Are you posting your own tweets here?
That's weird.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:11
Bad advice 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:42:11
Another quality Bitcoin post.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:28:34
It hit 14k briefly at like 5CST
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:24:23
UNLEASH THE MEMES
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:24
Netting or grossing?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:59
If you were to sell on Coinbase would that mean you wouldn’t get your money?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:14:56
Hey dude, I appreciate the offer. But I'll pass.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:13
Coinbase has an alert feature but it doesn’t work all the time from my experience. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:28:26
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:11:55
Sorry, no
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:19:29
I’m getting 404 and 502 errors when I try to buy. 
I think they’re having a rush right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:54
You’re doing this whole thing wrong
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:21:14
Alarming. 
I don’t like this...
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:28:41
500 trillion? Wow. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:29:44
Oh thank god, Eugene is here! Teach me how to not virginity so much.
