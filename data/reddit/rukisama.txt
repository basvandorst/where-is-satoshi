From what I've been reading, by the time I would get mine, many other people would have gotten theirs, thus diluting my mining power to the point it would be like CPU mining today (or at least comparable). 
Now, if I could somehow have an Jalapeno (What's the ALT code for the n with a tilde, btw?) in front of me right now and plug it in, it would be great.
But that's just my understanding of it, and I would gladly learn better.

That does seem sensible, though MOST opinions I've read say that this is just another bubble. While I mostly hope that it's not, and that Bitcoin will become widely accepted as a form of payment, a sortof guilty part of me would like another opportunity to buy low before it really took off.

Just got the Bitcoin client again...and DAMN does it take a long time to synchronize.

I see. I'm actually mining right now with my GPU, but I'm only getting about 45 mhash/s, which isn't too great, but that's the hardware I've got. I haven't put any extra money into hardware at this point, so that's good at least.

Right. I think the chances are pretty bad for turning a profit relatively quickly, without thousands of dollars worth of equipment.
I studied French in college, so I never had to learn that one, haha

I've been an Ars reader since near the beginning (I was in my young teens, yeesh), and it's great to see someone so well-respected in the tech journalism scene endorse Bitcoin this way.
One more step toward wide adoption.
