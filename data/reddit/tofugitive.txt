I'm currently travelling outside the US. I've funded by Abra wallet with Bitcoin. Now I can withdrawal to my bank account in the US. (Still a lot of banks not supported). I've effectively sent money to my US bank account from overseas quickly and easily and with Bitcoin. The alternative would have been to go to a bank where I am now, fill out a lot of paperwork, convert currency, pay large bank fees, get burned on the exchnage rate and then wait 3-5 days. I think Abra is a brilliant idea and PayPal is going to be forced to eventually integrate support for Bitcoin.

The ETF would have brought a huge influx of money into Bitcoin from people who are comfortable calling yo their broker or going to their online trading account, but who have no idea and no desire to figure out, how to create a wallet, buy and store Bitcoin.

Went to sign up today. First saw $10k minimum, then saw 6 week KYC, then saw posts about funds being eagerly received and then held hostage.  Beginning to wonder why anyone uses Bitfinex. My only interest is the OCO functionality.

Go back to BTC exclusively. Put it on a Trezor. Lock it in a safe. Wait 1-3 years. you'll have your money back.

Any news on this? Looking at RightBTC for Arbitrage opportunity, but if it's all wash trading / outright scam, I think I'll pass...

Oh so BTC isn’t fungible? Some Bitcoin are better than others. If this isn’t a screaming call to use Monero I don’t know what is.

It's unprecedented because this is the first time in crypto history where a 1000+ tokens hit the market and many of them were / are taken very seriously and saw insane price increases in less than a year. Then you had all the mainstream news and youtubers, and 'regular' people started buying in. Market cap went to highest ever - what near $750 billion? No one knows a year from now if the entire market is going to be at under $100b or over $1 trillion. No one knows if people will laugh at how cheap $20k BTC was or how stupid people were to buy in at $20k.

How does anyone know the bottom? This is a unprecedented.
