Except for the "False" you're not really contradicting him anywhere I believe

And that's what we call a bubble, my friend

interesting. Thanks.

don't these only indicate a fraction of what he possesses. Movement of these wouldn't be definitive indicator of unloading I think. Although extension of this idea should be useful for the task at hand. Thanks

So, the transactions on regular dollars happen on computers of the large banks which do the required calculations and keep records of transactions. Similarly transactions of bitcoin happen with calculations on computers of people like you and I, who are willing to contribute to it. The bitcoin software rewards these contributors by generating fixed number of coins every 10 minutes and distributing proportionately. The process of contributing to computation is called mining

Will ask an accountant about this

I understand your plight, I totally support bitcoin in that respect. But lets not give examples of, fake economic collapse to Bitcoin's advantage. This might seem against popular opinion and even another in context of US but hear me out. 
The move made was to weed out money with individuals stored in form of cash earned through illegitimate sources like bribes, which is a major problem in India. With fiat, it could be done while in case of gold or Bitcoin, not so much. How do you think wealth distribution problem will pan out with Bitcoin? Bitcoin is placed with a handful of individuals in international context and it's being distributed into others. Don't you think it is a huge, first moved based, problem where, the poor people in third world countries, suffer? With bitcoin, we're probably only moving from one set of problems to other. There's an anti institutional sentiment in people living in capitalist American economy, but does this justify forceful application to rest of the world?

I never mentioned the need for paternalistic institutions. But the solution Bitcoin provides is inherently beneficial to first world.
Think of this way, world has only started mining gold recently but first world money 3 quarters of it in the beginning and now ready of the world would have to purchase from them at higher prices. Makes sense?

Yes, reason being, they wanted to identify all money associated to some individuals. The denomination was replaced by another denomination of equal value. Not because the economy was in crisis or something. 
Though there have been certain repercussions in the functioning of its economy, there certainly isn't something like, economic collapse. 
I think, the assumptions of easy collapse of economy is more of an American phenomenon and not something that happens very easily, unless you are a very traditionally regressive economy. The kind of economic Independence provided by a capitalist society to its individuals doesn't make sense and Bitcoin only tries to solve these problems in this ecosystem.

china won't ban bitcoin. It just wants to control and yet promote bitcoin with its people. banning bitcoin is bad for a country since it stops bitcoin's inflow inside it.
it's all my assessment, bring up any inaccuracies please
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:50:54
Disagree. No matter how nicely they adopt, the coins will still come from, bag holders as they're called. It is not third world's fault for not adopting Bitcoin, it just happens to be, or rather a natural course that, first world gets it first and sells to rest of the world

Actually, 99% percent of the fiat was returned which was much more than govt had expected as black money wasn't supposed to come back, as a preliminary Google would reveal.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:43:00
I give up. No point in trying if you don't even try to understand my stance
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:54:37
wow, when did india's economy collapse?
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:45:12
Also, your frustrations about stats, please explain, since the tracking the notes collected requires mere counting.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:03:27
that's your reason?, buying things with cash is nice? I think if we can make crypto-currencies convenient enough to be used as cash, it can in-fact replace fiat. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:44:52
India's economy was by no means struggling. I don't support the govt's move of demonetisation either. But supporting Bitcoin based on incorrect basis only weakens its case. I rest my case. I said all I had to.

I believe that should be rupee, which makes it about 80 million USD, still huge
