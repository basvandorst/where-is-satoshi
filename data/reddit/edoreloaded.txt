I'm concerned about the fraud aspect as well. Trying to explain the police at my door that I paid my order in bitcoin and have no clue of who's stolend credit card (or hacked paypal account) has been used on the merchant website, will not be a pleasant experience.

Thanks everyone for your nice comments.
I've been looking at all suggestions, trying to understand what type of "interest" (mining) x timeframe, I could get, as well as possible ROI.
Of course, when talking about PETA shares or CEX, ROI is a weird factor as it really depends on the price I could sell my investment (shares or hashing power) when I would get out of it. I just mean that if the share price of PETA, goes from 0.095 btc (15GH/s) to 0.07 btc, even if they pay a nice dividend of 3% weekly, it will take quite a long time to get ROI. The opposite is true, as buying PETA at first IPO of 0.05, regardless of the weekly dividend, selling shares at 0.07 makes quite a huge ROI and interest.
(oh, same goes for nicehash).
I endedup for the time being on Scryptx (managed by same guys of PETA, on Havelock). The dividend is a fair 1.5/2% weekly and the price seems quite underevaluated at the moment.
I'll be updating this post to let everyone know how it goes.
(btw, Scryptx adds the additional variables of mining alt curr as Litecoin and Dogecoin, converting them daily into BTC, but the shareprice and the weekly div are in BTC)
I know, it's still a big gamble, but it looks to me like the odds are more favorable.
cheers and thanks again to all of you for your kind info!

Apparently they don't have redundant hardware to take care of these issues. This is annoying. In lower (importance) companies I worked for, for lower importance services, there were 4 redundant servers/server rooms/power supplies/power sources/internet lines. A regular earthquake wouldn't have stopped the (shitty) service. And here we go with this important piece of the bitcoin world for over 24h?
@_date: 2014-06-25 21:14:48
Do I know you? Excluding the typo, this bet makes more sense. 3 months time, 0.1btc per share.
 I would like to know what the cryptx team thinks about it (or even if they simply give a sh!t about the shareprice at all).

I play here:
@_date: 2014-06-25 12:00:04
hahaha. 
So, you want me to hold 1btc (for example) on this bet website for 6 months, not getting the weekly dividend (currently ~4%) betting that 0.048 will double in the period of time. Or that it won't.
If (a big IF) they would pay out 3% weekly, stable, on Jan 1st the share price could even be 0.01344* and you would still be even (not reinvesting the weekly div).
edit *per share
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:05:29

In 10 weeks you would make roughly 30% profit from dividends, assuming the price stays stable.
And here we are talking about 6 months/ 28 weeks.
If you are sire it will go bad soon, why wait 6 months? Make another bet on a shorter timeframe... I would bet on that :)

Does it really matter? Once they (or any other agency) will be able to pinpoint address owners (in liaison with merchants and other services), it will be easy to track "money" movements. I think this is the whole reasoning behind it. And it doesn't even need to be in real time... just assign some super computer network to analayse the blockchain and follow traces, beefing up the data with all the other known sources of information that they already have access to.
Now, is this really bad?

@_date: 2014-05-24 16:38:38
aml, kyc, solvency... guys, really. these are three different things.
I'm not aware of any case where someone couldn't get through these and then get their money or btc out. Bitstamp has never been reported to have any issue similar to gox. Gox issues were widely known in advance but still, not everyone took it seriously and still greedly wanted to leofit from the different prices between gox and other exchanges. 
Bitstamp may be a little slow on answering to some topics, but their support has been always veey actively reaponding where either the issue was urgent or the amount was relevant. 
Before screaming on solvency issues because they HAVE to process your transaction through aml and kyc procedure, you really need to take things in perspective. They don't really give a shit about where you got your coins or your cash. They just need to comply with their bank requirements tp prove that they did aml and kyc procedures. Else, bank account gets closed and then the issues begin.
I still trust these guys and I'm sure they have no intention to kill the gold egg layinfg chicken to have a short term profit.

It is actually enough to do multiple things (or none!).
Advertising (google?) may still be a good option for a small amount of btc. The rest... well, no urgency to spend it now. Also, I don't agree on refunding the doners. They donated with a purpose... If not a mere advertising of the subreddit or of bitcoin in general, a page/web with useful guides and links would still be something nice. And you have enough to pay someone doing it :)

@_date: 2014-06-14 18:48:54
Shouldn't be the exchanges and all online wallets to be pushing for this?
I know that here everyone is such an expert on credit cards, but here we are (maybe) seeing the foundation for a future network of "green address" providers. In some EU countries, Visa, MC, are just brands managed by a local centralized network of payment by card providers.
Yeah, sometimes a restaurant in Venice will accept Jcb cards. But good luck finding a gas station accepting it. And there is no "double spend" issue there! 
So, let's ask Bitstamp, Kraken and few other exchanges to adopt bip70 and instant confirmation.
Let's make history!

Hosting a full node should be mandatory to miners.
How to do that, I don't have a clue.
Or hosting a full node should be rewarded...
We need full nodes and miners.
however, with btc exchange rate being this low, only some miners find profit and the network suffers. The exchange rate should be higher to be able to cover for electricity costs. It's a bloody spiral. If fiat price increase, mining is more profitable, more miners will turn on their machines, more electricity will be spent, difficulty goes up, more electricity is needed, and we are back to square one.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:15:44
If not military or NSA... some"thing" else. But honestly agree. I honestly think that it is quite a possibility.
As a controlling power, wouldn't you like to see:
- where money is exchanged
- (since you spy everything) who is exchanging what.
- (since you have access to everything) why this money is exchanged.
- (since you have access to everything) what this money is exchanged for.
- and more. (like controlling wealth by blaming it on "hackers", to mention one).
If the will of power and control is big enough... wouldn't you hire a statistician (of some sort) or a math geek (of some sort) and implement the thing?
Internet in the '90 wasn't sooooo similar? Why would I want someone to know who are my friends and give them access to my location and my data? Still, I do it for free with social media... Not to mention a mobile phone...
So yes, my two cents... It would be some superpower organization.
But then... why not embrace it? Would you avoid using internet because someone is spying it? Apparently not.

Should I declare it? Should you?
We should consider bitcoins as gold or any other material. Once it is sold for FIAT, then we have a gain and we pay taxes.

It's a tip, in bitcoins :)
Welcome to this subreddit :)

Ooops, how do i amend my order? (Size L)

Further on this, my bank informed me that i can request a swift confirmation (30 euro) to give back to Bitstamp and or a full refund request (30 euro).
My bank also told me that their bank confirmed the reception of funds the next day and that there was no incident with this transfer.
Basically, bitstamp has my money since 2 weeks and they don't reply to my support tickets anymore. Well, maybe that's because they are under ddos attacks...
Bad service, bad customer service... and I should trust them with my money??? Never more.

Apparently usd is bitstamp and eur is mtgox.
Makes sense... :( my bad.

This is exactly what i wanted to do for my Emma (not even 2 months old).
How reliable will it be?
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:08:11
I don't get it... just go to the police and report it. The police will ask PayPal and the IP will then be provided... to the police... not to you!

The parallelism with '95 internet feeling, left me speechless for few moments.

Yes, I'm in Spain and my account with them is fully verified (ID, proof of residency, utlity bill).
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:11:11
and sorry to ask, but then you have no issues in taking out the money from mtgox?
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:11:18
opened an incognito page, returned to the non-incognito one, all fine...

Is there any employer that wants to share his side of the story? I mean, either you purchased those BTC in advance, making huge savings on salary costs, either you purchase them at payout day with higher costs.... or am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:04:40
ok, no deal.
Thanks for the quick answers.
RIP gox!!! :)

Still no updates. 
Bitstamp ceo wrote me a private message to tell me he will look personally into this... still nothing.

quite interesting topic.
Once the last block is mined, and once the miners stop maintaining the blockchain, most likely the users/people would not want to download gigas of the blockchain. At that moment, trading places would be the ones keeping the updated version? 
I know it's all theoretical, but I wonder what Satoshi thought about it. Will we have big entities maintaining and guaranteeing for transactions?
And then, the nightmare: would they communicate? would we have a 51% type of issue?
(and a question, as I honestly don't know: would the old miners still receive fees, after they stopped mining?)

Casacius provided his identity as a guarantee for what he sells.
 If (when) btc is worth thousands.. maybe they could access their own db and get all the credits, blaming hackers/terrorism/nsa.
I would still not trust someone for so many years.

Verification is optional. 
I used them the first time and everything went smoothly.
Second time: still waiting.
Catalunya Caixa. 
Weird thing: a colleague of mine did his transfer (same bank) and got it the next day in his bitstamp balance. A second colleague using La Caixa, 3 days (as expected).
It is strange and I am not talking bad about Bitstamp. It's just a bad experience I wanted to share and find out if someone else got the same issue :(
