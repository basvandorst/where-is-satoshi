We need to begin the move to trustworthy centralised exchanges or the ones that are decentralised. Viva la P2P networks!

How do you know that Bakkt comes in November? Aren't they in PoC kind of stage? 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:12:51
Does this imply that an off chain node on LN can technically serve as a custodial service? Or as a decentralised exchange? If it has enough balance? Really neat to see the progress! Is the pee always paid on the on chain network? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:56:19
The issue of liquidity has been raised over and over. It makes me scary imagine the future of fully traceable Bitcoins. Seems like they might have been able to trace you and stored this info/sent it to governments which want it. Reckon its time to change the provider? 
GDPR should give you the opportunity, however I am also questioning the proof of data deletion from institutional side. I have been thinking many times about a 100% security that the data will be withdrawn; couldn't come up with a solution

How long do you assume that it will take to draw those OTC rules? Isn't Huobi trying to pave the way there? 
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:46:04
Proper response! Make sense to me and sometimes it's worth to wait a bit more to offer a simpler solution for a basic user

There could be some solutions in ways of mesh networking maybe but if there is a full electricity cut all those things won't really matter.

That's the often questioned fungibility of Bitcoin. Hope we will capable to prevent it with some privacy proposals but crosschains with private currencies cannot be a bad movement either. Just simplify it a bit more.

Marketing in a whole new level

I was just speculating that it could be an issue due to the different block consensus. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:09:40
This is great! Thanks for seeing this especially in such a chaotic day. Technology is moving forward. To scale this and adopt it, that will be higher. Has only BCH on chain been tested? What about Proof of Stake chains. Cheers 
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:34:19
Very well elaborated 
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:12:47
Would you agree that this passive activity awaits for G20 to outline shared viewpoint and then allow things to move forward? I definitely envision a coshared US body that overlooks the situation in the CC market....my question is whether will they wait for the world agreement to move 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:50:23
This is a nonchalant representation of satire. Oppressive governance won't ever bring power to people. Dissolve his control, whatever it takes, even collapse the regime. Turkey might be the country of the great Crypto revolution

Or in our own bodies. As cyborgs

Proof for that? Blockchain brought transparency, show me the hash

The currency as a whole can be discarded as the bearer. This happened numerous times and might potentially happen in this situation as well.

Happy Birthday Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:34:46
Right. It's probably good idea to jump in and jump out with at least 60% right as they get them on exchange. Still, it might be a working project..
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:31:04
True that. Stepping into the market with something what already exists could change a lot. Have you been following this idea for some time? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:04:38
Gambling is always a to-go business but I seek something more humane probably. Will be checking it out! Thanks for heads up 
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:01:49
I would question the relevance of fungibility. Bitcoin is really lacking there. You don't really know through how many hands a 5 dollar bill went. Though I can figure out all the previous owners of your satoshi

Centralization of mining power is deliberately an issue and hopefully will be worked on with other institutions joining the game. On the other hand, LN nodes as ledgers provide the deemed decentralisation already.
Who knows what might happen and if ever Bitcoin becomes invalidated. For now the focus should be on development 
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:17:53

Do you know what he did? He profited for himself, used bitcoin, raped it few times, and tried to castrate it with 2x. Clap clap. That guy has lost respect 
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:42:12
This seems to be the best way to explain it

Nice proposition and I can imagine a system where it works this way. Though there is already so much interest and amount of money vested that this is not going to happen.

It's like when the price isn't important anymore, people start speaking about valid and interesting things. Moon Boyz went for a winter nap

Go Lightning somehow and I am ready to tip as well. More fun to explore the edge.. And still be somehow reckless - for android I would recommend Breeze utilizing Neutrino. iOS Bluewallet for simplicity but custodian. The best would be run your own as we all know. All your choices - be on the verge
@_date: 2019-12-12 18:01:53
I am sorry padawan, you don't have to buy anything. There is no such a critical crossroad - not today, not tomorrow. It happened ten years ago, on the brink - when we found a cryptographic way to remove capital creation from the state.
The society of the future is society denominated and accounted in the trustless digital bearer - distributed and decentralised. Robust and secure. Truly ours. Today does not matter - there will be ups and downs on the way.
No one ever said the way to freedom will be easy - we were given the tool. Let's fight for it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:34:06
Thank you very much man!

Does the one who closes channel pays the blockchain fee or is it split in between participants in the channel?
@_date: 2018-07-21 18:27:26
That makes sense to me. Keep the precious to yourself. Are you also experimenting with stocks or ETF's?
I doubt it has to do anything with economy. The demand for blockchain developers is pretty heavy everywhere in the world. Workforce is global now. Would you be kind enough and provide non-descriptive information about your objectives? As a Slovakian living in the NL, I have broad contacts in Prague. People connected to Trezor, people who developed Paralelní Polis. Same applies for Slovakian blockchain community and really between Czech/Slovakian isn't difference whatsoever. Would be glad to support or something similar. My background is Marketing/Communications.
Sorry for later response. Had some busy days
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:45:58
Very interesting. Have you been achieving satisfactory capital performance? Must be always a bit of tweaking to keep it running well, right? Aren't you considering to provide - sell-the code for others?
Also, are you still considering to push business opportunities in Prague? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 11:27:12
This is absolutely brutal! Thank you for furthering brighter minds in their cryptographic developments. For me the answer is ONE!

You often need to provide KYC. No go

Wait, do I understand it right that channels profit for channeling transactions between nodes in LN? I have thought the profit is directed to the miners. Am I mistaken? 
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:08:57
Not impressed by the source. Anyways, it is clear to me that there was some shady manipulation behind doors to make sure that results show positive response to 'stress test' crisis. If it comes, everyone will be squeezed as we were in 2008. Hopefully except those who put money I to hedging mechanism - cc
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:12:11
Correct, it might really hurt temporarily but it wouldn't be impractical. Maybe it would hurt for few years from now but fundamentals still work. However, I do agree that slow and correct implementation is much more important. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:21:47
Clearly CBOE might be prepared better for this above mentioned Act due to the previous experience. Still doesn't say much. It really seems that the delay is imminent. See you in 2019 ETF 
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:17:48
I'm very much pro MAST that slightly improves the privacy but what would really be a game changer is implementation of confidential transactions. I know its not only Bitcoin looking at it so it might be most of the ecosystem moving towards this solution 
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:29:30
Is the trading algorithm based on oracles? And if you wouldn't mind, are we speaking about indexing or particularly BTC trading

Sezos is Batoshi? What reality do we live? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 11:14:05
Thank you drehb. Will evaluate.
EDIT: Read it through. It's interesting but quite outdated right? I think the possible vectors of issues were addressed with proposition of watchtowers and anonymity through MAST? At least on the paper right..
Anyways, thanks for sharing insights.

Interesting. Is there a software that comprehends different routing fees set by LN nodes and evaluates appropriate fee structure?
.. "breaks satoshis into thousand of pieces" can you elaborate please? I haven't ever heard that one Satoshi could be split. How that mechanism work? And what is thousands? I can totally imagine split by two, max 10 but it boggles my mind we can go to such tiny numbers.
Thanks a lot!

Truly impressive comment. We will all see how it will go; halvening should definitely impact scarcity but there is so many unknowns in this world. Wish you luck with mining operation!
