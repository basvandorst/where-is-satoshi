Nah, reddit has some seriously smart people. It'd need up votes to get their attention, but I'm off to bed now. I'll see again in the morning if I've made headline news :-D  I estimate 1 in 2^256 chance of that.

Every transaction has a unique signature, proving who sent the bitcoin.
This is just a fun, abstract mathematical idea asking if there is an alternative way to generate the signature, without all that faffing about with private keys and SHA-256. If there is, it would break bitcoin.

I bought 20 BTC for 64p each in 2011, and sold out at £19 a bitcoin later that year. I'm so glad I got out before the bubble burst!

True, true. It's just a fun idea, to help understand the concepts :-)
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:51:08
Unfortunately, I did not.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:38:35
Sooner rather than later I hope :-)

Thank you, I think this is the most carefully thought out response so far :-)
I basically agree, apart from where you say 


But we're not trying to brute force it. We're training a neural network to approximate a mathematical function that is actually "relatively simple", just a few thousand operations. Replicating a single bit of SHA-256 is nothing like looking for collisions, computationally :-)
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:13:02
Yep, I pretty much agree with the conclusion, if not the comparison to brute force, as remember, even 10 fully connected layers with a single value output would only be a 160^2 x 10 = 256,000 neuron network. Computing a single SHA-256 on your computer isn't that bad ;-)
Neural networks can be "universal function approximators" but whether or not the function is learnable is a whole different thing!
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:26:52
Nah the whole point is that we're not trying to reverse it, only replicate it. Does this make a difference, or am I being stupid?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:37:03
My pleasure :-)

Can you prove there isn't? The fact that collisions are theoretically possible suggests that there is.
The Large Bitcoin Collider people are banking on that there are as many as 2^96 private keys for every 1 public address.
It doesn't even have to be lower kolmogorov complexity for this to work. It can be more complex, it just has to be approximatable, and learnable by a neural network.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:59:28
Yes. I genuinely think this idea has legs! I thought I'd put it to the community of people smarter than me :-)
