The shape-shift method works fine, but there have been times recently when shape-shift wasn't supporting Monero. 
Another alternative is:  If you've already acquired Monero, and you have them in a wallet like MyMonero.com, then  xmr.to allows you to anonymously convert them to bitcoin and send them to any valid bitcoin address you choose.

I know there is disagreement about this, but in my estimation, segwit being signaled would result in a major boost in the price of bitcoin. If that is true, then it seems like a no-brainer for miners to want to signal for segwit in order to maximize their income. Since most of the mining hashrate has not signaled for segwit, then I conclude that the miners must not agree that adopting segwit would result in a price increase. If it were possible to convince them otherwise, segwit endorsements should follow.
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:09:42
And it's at least plausible, if not likely, that SegWit adoption would result in a bitcoin price increase of more than 10%, which would more than offset any loss in transaction fees.

It’s hard to identify the reason for a price change, but this seems like the most important factor to me. At least to me, it is obvious that the core devs have a long-term vision for bitcoin and are building key infrastructure features, which in the long run have the potential to enormously increase bitcoin’s utility. Once this infrastructure is implemented, it seems like gaining consensus for a carefully thought out block size increase, with the support of some of the core devs, should be relatively easy. This is especially true, given how easy it was for Classic to gain so much support for a hastily constructed “plan” that emphasized short term results over a long term vision. Now that it appears cooler heads will prevail, I feel much more optimistic about bitcoin’s future.

Thank you, but there's something I'm not understanding. If you need to explicitly open a port for the crawler to be able to find your node, then wouldn't it fail to find lots of nodes? My node is fully synched and it says I have 8 active connections, yet the crawler won't find it unless I explicitly open port 8333. Presumably there are lots of other nodes besides mine that are running but haven't explicitly opened port 8333, so it wouldn't be able to find them either, and the number of nodes identified by this website would be way under-counted, right?

Erik, I’m a long-time admirer of yours, not just because of how you’ve promoted bitcoin, but because of the way you’ve conducted yourself and the way you’ve articulated many of the values I believe in. It’s not often that I disagree with you, but given my own conclusions about the block size controversy, I’m surprised at the position you seem to have taken.
As I've tried to understand the issues, I've changed my opinion several times, but always upon further study, I have concluded that Core has the most level-headed and sensible roadmap for scalability. At least to me, it is obvious that the core devs have a long-term vision for bitcoin and are building key infrastructure features, which in the long run have the potential to enormously increase bitcoin’s utility. They realize there is a lot more to scaling bitcoin than simply raising the block size and after careful consideration, have decided that the infrastructure changes should be made first.
Once this infrastructure is implemented, it seems like gaining consensus for a carefully thought out block size increase, with the support of some of the core devs, should be relatively easy. This is especially true, given how easy it was for Classic to gain so much support for a quickly constructed “plan” that emphasized a short term fix over a long term vision. 
I also think the devs have done an excellent job of explaining their positions, even though you might have to search through various posts to find the explanations. In addition, there are a number of other articulate and technically proficient posters, who have taken time to further explain and clarify their positions. Naturally, I’d prefer to see a polished website with FAQs and edited articles, but there’s a limit to their time and resources.
In my view, the weak bitcoin price is largely due to the threat of a potentially devastating contentious hard fork, and the best way to mitigate that threat is to wait for some of the remarkable developments already in progress to be completed rather than supporting a group with a single short-term solution that requires a contentious hard fork.

2. Use-case for Exchanges using Lightning payment channels so you don’t have to deposit funds directly with the exchange.
3. Impact of smart contracts.
4. Bitcoin politics. His role in the Hong Kong blocksize agreement.
5. BitMain and vulnerabilities of centralized mining.
6. Control of Bitcoin by holders/users vs control by miners. E.g. BitGo supporting Segwit.
7. Working on better methods for measuring agreement on hardforks.
8. Believes bitcoin will still be using same POW in 5 years. If changed will be by value leaving to another coin.
9. Suspects bitcoin may eventually support direct on-chain scaling . Miners might be able to collaboratively mine with some miners mining some transactions and some mining others using methods like sharding so that they don’t have to have the entire chain.

A contentious hard fork is risky and ordinarily the known risks would make it unlikely that very many people with a substantial stake in bitcoin would want to risk it. However, in the current situation, there are many bitcoin users who are dissatisfied with the current block size and there is already an alternative version called Bitcoin XT that will allow larger block sizes. If at least 75% of the bitcoin’s mining power switches to Bitcoin XT, then Bitcoin XT will start to mine blocks on a competing block chain. Given the number of people, some of whom have a lot of influence in the bitcoin world, who want larger block sizes, IMO it has become fairly likely that there will be a contentious fork.

I’m not sure I understand your questions. Whether or not a fork occurs does not depend on anything an individual can do with his wallet. If it looks like a fork is imminent, you should probably move whatever coins you have from your online wallet to a wallet that is stored on your personal computer BEFORE the fork occurs. Then if you carefully employ the strategy suggested by sgornick above, you will be able to spend your coins on both chains, but even though you may have coins on both chains, their total value will still probably be worth less than it was before the fork. If you search for posts by sgornick on this subject, he goes into detail about exactly what you would need to do to insure that your coins are spendable on both chains.

A hard fork is caused when a new version of the bitcoin client software accepts blocks which would not be accepted by the previous version of the software, such as blocks that are over 1 MB. The new client starts adding the big blocks to its version of the blockchain but the old client rejects the new blocks as invalid and continues building its blockchain under the old rules, so now the blockchain is forked into two different versions. One version is recognized by people running the old software and one version is recognized by people running the new version. Because there is no universally accepted valid block chain, the lack of unanimous agreement causes confusion and uncertainty and this would most likely be followed by a loss in value.

@_date: 2015-07-24 14:27:26
Thanks very much for taking the time to thoroughly explain this. I’ve read a lot about the block-size controversy and am still conflicted about the best course of action, and even if I somehow knew the best course of action, there wouldn’t be much I could do about it. So I am apprehensive that there will be a hard fork. Rather than converting all of my bitcoins to fiat and then reconverting after the dust has settled, this strategy gives me a way of holding onto my bitcoins and mitigating my expected losses from the fork should it occur.
So if I’ve understood it correctly, I would:
1.	Install wallet software for both Bitcoin-core and Bitcoin-XT.
2.	Let’s say I start with a balance of 100-core coins in my Bitcoin-core wallet.
3.	Copy my wallat.dat from the Bitcoin-core folder to the Bitcoin-XT folder. At this point I will have 100 coins in both Core and XT.
4.	Purchase or otherwise obtain a small amount (Let’s say .1 bitcoins) of coins in my Bitcoin-XT wallet that have taint from a coinbase transaction mined after the fork. How do I do this though? If I purchase some XT coins from an exchange, the unspent outputs that comprise the input for my XT coins may all be from transactions occurring before the fork, so they wouldn’t be tainted. Do I just have to keep doing this and then checking a block explorer until I’m sure I have at least some amount of Bitcoin-XT that is tainted by a coinbase transaction occurring after the fork?
5.	Send the entire amount of my XT wallet balance (100.1 coins) to a new receiving address in my XT wallet. I’ll call this the “Balance-tainting transaction”. This ensures that the new address is tainted with a XT coinbase transaction and thus cannot ever be used to expend my balance on the original Bitcoin-core chain.
6.	So now I will have a balance of 100.1 XT coins in my new XT-wallet and I will still have a balance of 100.0 Core coins in my old Core wallet. The coins in my Core wallet cannot be spent on the XT chain because they’ve already been spent there in my “Balance tainting transaction” and the coins in my XT wallet can’t be spent on the Core chain because they have a non-conforming input stemming from the .1 coins I purchased with coinbase taint after the fork.
Please let me know if I’ve misunderstood anything.

@_date: 2015-07-24 18:16:02
Ah, yes. Of course. Untainted coins would be worth more than tainted coins because they could always be spent on both chains by copying them to a new XT wallet and tainting them. Naturally any coins you get sent after the fork would be the tainted coins which are less valuable.
Thanks a lot for your help.

1. Install Rise Wallet App and set up wallet and backup seed phrase.
2. Buy Rise Wallet gift card from store or online, and pay card activation fee. Presumably you can just pay with cash.
3. Scratch off the back of the card and scan the code that is revealed.
4. The bitcoins are transferred to your wallet
Unfortunately for persons living in the US, it looks like this is only available in Canada. Otherwise it would be a clever way of getting around KYC requirements for people wanting to purchase their first bitcoins. Presumably FINCEN would consider this a violation of AML laws and would make the cards illegal to purchase in the US without following KYC rules which would be impractical.

Very good explanation. There's been a lot of misinformation about LN, but now I have a much better grasp of how LN works, which puts me in a better position for evaluating some of the claims (both positive and negative) about it.  send 1 coffee

As usual, a well-written and thoughtful article, and I admire your courage as a heretic. I don’t really understand the technology well enough to have a valid opinion about how much bitcoin can scale without an increase in the block size. But your article does a good job of explaining that there are features in development which might plausibly be able to greatly increase scalability without any block size increase at all. 
And whatever the best approach is to the block size limit, it seems best to me to wait and see how well some of these features play out. The risk of losing users because the network (at least for a while) can’t support as many transactions as are initiated, seems far outweighed by the potential risks to Bitcoin’s long term success from a contentious hard fork.  
If it turns out that the features under development are not enough to satisfy demand for block size space, then it seems likely to me that the core devs will come out in favor of an increase, and at that point any increase will be much less contentious. In the meantime, we will have learned a lot more about the fee market and how an increase in the block limit can best be implemented.

This article contains some original and clearly expressed thoughts and some speculation about the promising future for LN. Although a lot of it is just speculative, the fact that it is written by one of the bitcoin’s seminal thinkers and is supported by some understandable back-of-the-envelope calculations make it well-worth reading even if you think you already know a lot about the Lightning Network.

This is by far the best analysis of Tether that I’ve ever seen. A lot is just speculation, but it seems to be very plausible and well-informed speculation. They go so far as to speculate which bank may be servicing Tether and provide some analysis to buttress that speculation.
They don’t actually say it in so many words, but the impression I am left with after reading the report is that the money backing Tether is probably all there, but Tether has not been fully transparent about it because it might put regulatory pressure on their bank(s) and threaten their banking relationships.

Good tweet from Bruce, but I didn't see anything new in the replies.
I start out assuming good faith when I hear an argument I disagree with, but in this case it's hard to maintain that assumption. Some of the proponents of 2X are way too smart not to understand the overwhelming arguments against it.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:05:37
Very nice article about the wagers/trades shaping up between NO2X advocates and Roger Ver. I hope these are made enforceable so no one is able to renege on their commitments. While reportedly not a huge amount of Ver's bitcoin wealth, it shows a lot of courage and confidence by some of the NO2X supporters with smaller fortunes.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:38:04


Bitcoin's developers are among the best in the world. It's unbelievable that there are so many large businesses willing to institute a very few "2X" developers going for a so-called "quick-fix" that would result in a one-time controversial doubling of the block size, in exchange for a group of experienced developers who are dedicated to censorship-resistance and long-term solutions.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:01:11
Good questions. I'd like to hear some serious and honest answers from some of the NYA signers.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:08:30
Two excellent points I'd like to emphasize:


One of the arguments against replay protection is that 2X is practically guaranteed to be the dominant chain because of it's superior hash rate. In fact it's so "guaranteed" that Erik is willing to risk a $70B bitcoin economy on it. Yet if it's that certain, it seems like a no-brainer to make an even swap of his regular BTC for 2X coins. And yet AFAICT he hasn't responded to any of the offers to make that swap. Why not?


I suspect that he would say that since some of the supporters of NYA have large numbers of customers, that's indicative of user support. But of course we know it's not the same thing. Heck, I'm a Coinbase customer and I certainly don't support NYA. And as Cryptolution points out, Coinbase hasn't made any effort to conduct a Sybil resistant poll on a matter that is of fundamental importance to users. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:02:40
I have a feeling you’re already acquainted with the arguments so I’m not going to go into a lot of detail, but off the top of my head here are some of the main points:


2. Even if doubling the block weight were necessary, there is no urgency, as segwit was only recently implemented and additional scaling strategies are in development. It would need to be done with plenty of lead time and with great care, and possibly coupled with some of the improvements on the bitcoin hard fork wish list. It would also need to be discussed openly in technical forums.
3. 2X has no replay protection which means people are going to lose money.
4. Virtually none of the major contributors to bitcoin core, who are among the best developers in the world, would continue working on the 2X chain.
5. 2X harms decentralization by allowing a small cabal of companies to control the direction of bitcoin and by making it more burdensome to run a full node.
6. There is already a big-block bitcoin alternative available with BCash.
Some of the brightest people in bitcoin have presented these and other arguments much more eloquently and thoroughly than I have, but this should give you a few of the basics. If you want more detail, googling “Bitcoin no2X” will link to plenty of good articles
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:50:09
And yet you are willing to jeopardize the future of a $70B bitcoin economy by moving forward with 2X that depends in large part on some miners  that you don't know well enough. If it's that uncertain, the 2X needs to be labeled as such on exchanges to reduce confusion and it needs replay protection to help safeguard non-sophisticated users.
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:35:02
Thanks Vaultoro. Exactly what was meant by the NY 2X agreement was never well-specified to begin with, and it is likely that there was no real meeting of the minds. It was certainly reasonable for signers to expect that the agreement they signed would be done more responsibly and include replay protection that would help safeguard users from losing funds.

I think the violation of the NAP has do do with the issue of fraud and failing to carry through with a promise to do your duty as a fiduciary to protect the funds of those customers whose money you are holding.
The argument that it is fraud is that if exchanges do not clearly   label and differentiate their products, and give you product B when you thought you had product A, or give you only product B when you should get both A and B, you are taking their property through deception. 
A fiduciary has a responsibility to do what is reasonable to protect its clients' funds. By introducing a product without strong replay protection, you are pretty much guaranteeing that a lot of people are going to lose money that they wouldn't have otherwise.
Additionally there has been deception in mislabeling software so people may be confused about exactly what version of the software they are running, and the implications of what that can mean for them.
I guess whether this rises to the level of fraud or violation of the NAP is debatable, but even if it doesn't, it's damn shady.
