Despite your edit, I suspect you bring it up A LOT. It's bothering you so much because you know they might be right.

While I believe the author has good intentions, he's not saying anything that hasn't been said a million times before. His advice to hold is also questionable and unsupported by the rest of the piece. 
Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, that much is virtually assured. But whether or not any of the current coins -- including Bitcoin --  will remain relevant is anyone's guess.

You hit all the major concerns right on the head. This is the wildest of gambles.

You kind of seem like a douche. Have some fucking respect for your mother

Uhh, yeah, there is love. Trezor is an extremely popular brand in this space.

This Vaukins appears to be one of the only sane people on this subreddit. I hold no position in crypto, btw. Just watching this madness play out from the sidelines

No investor is fleeing the stock market and putting that money into the most volatile asset in the world. Really an absurd idea.

I'm not sure if you're serious, but that's not what I mean, at all. They have money, and would never but it into the Wild West that is crypto.

Yeah, you're right, everything is just great. Nothing to worry about, at all.
