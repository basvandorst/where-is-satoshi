Sounds like he means Blockchain tech more than cryptocurrencies; alas... it's good to see this.
I do believe that 2018 will be the year when the big players will take actions in the field of blockchain and - secondary - cryptocurrencies.
Come 12/31/2018 we will look back and we'll hardly believe the changes.  If we can harness those with our business and investments, we can do pretty well.

Is anyone else worried about this happening in the US or wherever you live?
Has anyone thought about opening a new, separate, checking account to fund buying cryptos and - eventually - cash out?

Tell me what I am doing wrong

That was nice of them to tell you that they don't want your business, it's kind of reverse-marketing.

No equity?  You bought a house with no money down?
If you put down something even 5%, you have 5% as equity.  However is a good sub for general questions like this one.

I didn't mean to open an account outside the US, just at a different bank than my usual bank; just in case some crazy shit happens I can take my time to sort things out without affecting my "fiat life".

Why not go 1 step further?
If you have a mortgage it means you're a homeowner so you must have some equity in your house.
Use your HELOC (open one if you don't have one), every month put your paycheck in BTC, pay the bills from HELOC, then every so often, once a month or once every 3 months, pay off the HELOC from BTC; then start again.

Correct they are not, but ... just to give perspective to the **size**.
Size is everything.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:44:48
uhmmmm dunno bro.

I thought my way was simpler, since you only do fit-BTC only once in a while.

To be honest, I don't know for sure 100%, you can ask around; there might be some "minimums".
When I bought my house looooong time ago, I put down 20% and then the following week I opened a HELOC for the amount of the down payment, you know, for emergency purposes?  I seldom used it, and when I did was for low amounts and for a few days...
Ask around, see what they say and.. if no, you'll know when you can do it.

This is interesting:
36B$ * 365 = &gt;13T$/year
To put such a huge number into perspective, the size of the US economy is $19.3 Trillion (2017) [source: Wikipedia] .

True.  I second this.
I was in high tech startup for a very long time and, not only it's easy but - especially now - there's a lot of effort put to fund women entrepreneurs.
The only caveat for everyone: talent and willingness to work hard.

Not only MF is smart, fucking smart this is, a Nobel Prize is validation of that; but he's also a great guy.
Back in 1999 I was at a conference sponsored by the company where I worked and he was the keynote speaker.  He gave a great, informative, low key speech; and after that I had the opportunity to seat at the same table for dinner, along with 10 other people; I had some bits and pieces of conversation with him and .... I was on awe by the depth and breadth of his knowledge and how many times he replied "I don't know" or "Noone can possibly know that" to questions that people were asking him.

I am no lawyer but I have enough experience and knowledge.  This is what it's going to happen:
1. The SEC will state that cryptocurrencies are to be treated like any other currency
2. The SEC will state that cryptocoins used by companies to raise funds, are to be treated like stocks 
Sounds all well and good, however it means a blanket regulation with all the rules and regulation of other Forex/Stocks, including - but not limited to - daytrading regulation.
