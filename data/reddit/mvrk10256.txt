I bought one of the Jalapeno units for $150. I figured I could risk that with no issue. I really hope I get it sometime this year, cause when I called they told me it would be mid August at the latest (my order date is March 31), so I guess we will find out. 
In the meantine I am also buying bitcoin. That example is spot on. also its fun to play with. I bought 2 @ 125 and sold them at $137. Making $24 from 2 clicks.

1. buy bitcoin on an exchange - I like CampBX.   
  
2. Start mining today. Honestly at the current exchange $75 I strongly suggest buying a couple of ASIC Block erupters instead of graphics cards. Comparable performance, good price/performance, and less heat/noise.

Ya that makes sense. Like I said I just want my 7gh/s. That will make me happy. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:52:39
I am holding. Cause I bought it cheap, and now its still cheap, so basically its 1:1 for me, and I will continue to use it as my internet currency of choice. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:27:41
ok. I was under the impression bitcoin was supposed to be fairly instant. And bam, just as I am here bitching, there it goes. Money in the account. Time to go explore deepnet. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:51:31
No. I think its a huge miner. You get 2.2Gh/s for each share. So that should be like 1 btc every week or so? 
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:49:17
Its not gourdough's.
nuff said.

Goto their website. Click products, go to top click "My account", log in, and it will show your order(s) and their status. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:46:11
Thanks!. I guess since I am asking noob questions. Is there a good way to sync wallets between two computers using the bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:58:37
To be fair BFL has it listed on their site they will start shipping late April 2013. Today is April 16th. So if they do not ship anything before May 1, then ya, they lied, otherwise everyone needs to calm down on htat account. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:53:45
You pay for dropbox?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:14:02
Well I am from Russia, and now live in Texas. So I imagine its pretty fucking small. However I have been to London, public transit is pretty good. I was just throwing out a suggestion to those who are able and close. Not for everyone obviously. Possibly localtill does other banks too. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:19:47
Worst case scenario you continue using bidcoins for things that are security conscious. I would love for my 5BTC to = $1 mil USD, but even if it flattens and drops back it has opened a pandoras box that will not be closed. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 05:07:47
I think the real question will be if they deliver them at all?
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:48:11
Ya its was a newegg thingy. I mean I think its like 140 - $30 MIR but i got the gift card so it was all good. Noticed prices on GC lately kinda screwy, especially when you compare benchmarks from previous gens. 
@_date: 2013-08-10 18:33:15
Can you post prices ahead of time?
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:54:21
Well my order still says processing. I wonder if I will get it before the end of the summer. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:40:49
Also a job gives you a tax info income. I mean just watch the Sopranos. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:32:51
why can you use any American Exchange?
Go to bifloor. Select deposit via localtill. Take British pounds to normal bank, exchange for USD/ Take USD to local BofA branch. Have them do an out of country deposit. 30 min later you have USD in your bitfloor account. Trade to your hearts content or am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:01:44
If only they would just ship what they promised adn has already been payed for. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:52:41
*shrugs* Google map shows like 3-4 branches in London, and 2 in Liverpool. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:13:28
Quite frankly everyone is bitching about moving goal posts. I said this in another thread, I will say it again. 
BFL says on their site they will start shipping late April 2013. It is late april 2013 - they are shipping. Honestly though you guys must have thousands of orders. How about hiring a few extra guys  - maybe just to do the boxing or whatever. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:55:39
Only a year's more of orders till they are caught up. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:58:05
There is no need to post more updates like this. BFL Jody's blog keeps everyone up to date. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:15:51
I put in the address. The time stamp and amount is correct, but it says "unconfirmed transaction"
What does that mean?
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:21:29
Right. Do they already have units 1-5? or are they completely empty still? Cause this seems like a great idea. 
Buy massive ASIC rigs, sell people space. Take 2% + utilities. 2% on 5 machines is like haveing 17Gh/s for yourself for free. 
I am still waiting on my little pepper to get here from BFL. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:31:03
such a shame I much prefer bitfloor to mtgox. Although I think i will go back to useing mny BTC for SR and stop this trading nonsense. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:04:57
My graphics card cost about 1/5 of that and does 300MH/s consistently. 
The fuck?
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:14:42
Another kid here. I paid for school (lots of merit scholarships / personal business - not bitcoin) so my parents could pay of their house. 
I dont feel like I owe them anything, and everyone wins. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:36:38
I only ordered a Jally, so the fact they are closing in on the end of september already on the shipments makes me smile. Plus with the drop in USD/BTC I picked up a couple of those 300mh/s things that btcguild is selling. should be here in a week. Takes the load off my graphics card. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 19:13:47
or you can just keep checking the blog. She updates it M-F. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:59:58
Updated Daily.

So I lied slightly. I bought a HD6850 on sale for $110 a while (year or so) back and it does about 230, my laptop adds another 80 HD7730M so together I get about 300. However I could easily get an extra graphics card from a friend or whater for free to bring my PC to 300. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:28:06
no. But thats not really that relevant considering the cost of electricity where I live.
