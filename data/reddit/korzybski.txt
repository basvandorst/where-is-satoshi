Agreed. I've had over 50 bitcoin over the past 13 months, and I've always traded for things I wanted.
But now I'm holding onto it because I hope that one day soon, it'll be the de-facto medium-of-exchange.
The fiat lying on my desk right now stinks like shit. Who knows where this stuff has been.

Word-associations. Powerful affective semantic conditioning.
Until you realize words don't mean things.
And one replaces the process of identification with one of pausing to evaluate like a mature human.

I used Gyft for a Red Robin card.
I had the code on my phone via the Gyft app, and the waitress had me write the code down on the receipt. I was also able to tip via the card.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:39:54


Yes. And that you do, too, indicates, to me, something about you.
Let's see how far you'll take it.


In any interaction between two or more humans, it is possible for a game to be played.
If A *seeks* to misunderstand B, there is little B can do about it, if anything.
There is no such thing as a "satisfactory explanation". "Satisfactory explanation" are words. Words are not things. Asking "what constitutes a satisfactory explanation" is non-sense; one must look to the person issuing the words to understand their meaning behind the usage.
A lack of verbal clarification is an action. And actions speak louder than words. Ignore the words, look at what is being done. Person A enters bank to remove their funds; is told "no", and leaves without funds. The words exchanged matter very little; the action involved is what counts.
What I am hearing, behind the words "satisfactory explanation", is, "try to convince me, I dare you". Which you cannot do. If I think up-is-down and down-is-up, there is no force in the world that can stop me from believing so.
"Satisfactory explanation" is a euphemism for simply saying "no".
Now the question, and the only question, is, what is OP going to *do* about it?
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:43:15
I do-not support involuntary relationships. Period.
@_date: 2014-01-31 06:03:18
I pay gas-tax. I pay sales-tax.
I'd rather not pay for tanks, bombs, and the salaries of mercenaries.
Never-mind the fact that taxation represents an involuntary relationship.

What do you mean when you say regulation?
I understand "regulation" to mean a bunch of people I don't know, and who do-not know me, making up a bunch of rules I know nothing about, and then paying mercenaries to enforce those rules via the barrel of a gun.
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:54:32

This is an example of why I wish Korzybski and Mises knew each-other.
I could probably wax bull-shit with you, but my semantic-re-training wants me to point out that until you and I agree on what you mean by "they", "people", etc., with respect to referents, I don't think we'll understand each-other.

All that said, it's nice to meet someone whose at least heard of "the austrian school". :)

Words. What human-behavior are you referring to?
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:56:31
No such thing as "intrinsic value".
Value is subjective. A relationship between a human and another object.
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:59:59
Sorry man. That's a lotta scrilla.
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:27:36
Statements of fact can generally be made only after observation. Statements made about an event that go beyond what is observed are called "inferences".

Thank-you for doing this.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:20:48


What do you mean by...
1. "law of the land"
2. "dark site"
3. "tons of illegal drugs"
4. "stepping over the line"
To what human-behavior are you referring when you use each of these phrases?
I'd like to suggest that words-are-not-things; similar to the way in which a map-is-not-the-territory.
Labeling something "illegal" doesn't change the reality of the thing-event. It may color one's perception, but reality remains.
"Legal" was once used to describe "slavery-of-blacks". Today, I am under the impression, the word "illegal" is now used. But whether "legal", "illegal", or "qwop77" is used to describe something, the something remains.
Until the individuals involved in communication agree on the referents which the words used *point-to*, there can be nothing but misunderstanding.
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:13:04

One more point (perhaps):
You're comparing a man, with several concepts.
A man can be jailed. "Wells Fargo", cannot be put into a jail-cell.
No specific suggestions, just something to think about...

Whatever is going on inside your organism is real, objective, etc. The physico-chemical processes that are producing said thoughts, etc., are real.
But the verbal-map you're creating... doesn't, in my mind, accurately reflect reality.




*What* is a fact? That you believe your statement to be true? Yes, that could be factual. But the *content* of your speaking? Not likely...


What do you mean by that? 51% of the planet's population?
Your *belief* is real, but not necessarily reflective of reality.
If I hold in my hand a jar of peanut-butter, and I say, "I have three jars of peanut butter in my hand," my words do not fit reality. *Even if it's "fact" that I believe my words do.*
Another example... a Christian's belief in "god" may be "factual", but the content of the belief? Not so much...

Sure it is. An individual with years of experience in training horses will "see" more than I do, even if we look at the same situation involving horses.
What information do I get? Preference. One person's preference to display a number in manner X, and another person's preference to display an equal number in manner Y.
Humans engaging in mathematical-behavior will often rewrite an equation into "standard form", because it's *clearer*, potentially, *more informative, more quickly* than if the terms are written in a non-standard fashion.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:48:47

As determined by whom?
Things are not useful or interesting unto themselves.
A man *experiences* interest or *discovers* usefulness *in relation to a thing-event and himself*.
Suggesting a thing-event *is* useful or *is* interesting is akin to saying a thing-event has "intrinsic-value". No such thing.

To me, that's obviously bull-shit.
One does not find someone who does not want to be found by parading through the streets with that many people and that much gear.
