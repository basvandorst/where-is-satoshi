reposting this as its own comment since most people in this thread think he was just tweeting things
He went to my high school, Osbourn Park in Manassas, it was a big deal when he got arrested, from what i heard he was extremely smart and had offers from MIT as a junior. I also remember reading in my local news site (InsideNOVA) that he had founded his own arab bitcoin exchange which is pretty serious when you think about the possible implications, and as such makes it related to bitcoin. Just the fact he had the know how to smuggle people over there under the FBI's nose is a big deal, he had extensive knowledge on encryption and OPSEC since his twitter literally taunted the state departments twitter on several occasions over the course of i believe 6+ months before his arrest. This kid could have facilitated the transfer of bitcoin both to and from ISIS controlled areas, could have facilitated travel for new recruits, he was doing much more than social media advertising 
just as an extra bit of info; kid seemed completely normal, quiet and really smart but no one had a clue he was doing shit like that, fucking crazy because after his arrest we realized all the extra "teachers" and "administrators" that we'd seen the past few weeks were undercover FBI agents.

the school bends to whatever the police (or FBI) I can't blame them in this case but I know they've done this before for drug busts and such which is rather fucked in my opinion, a friend of mine who sat next to him in a class got a call the day after he was arrested asking if they could come to his house and ask him some questions, they weren't rude about it just asked basic stuff and made sure he didnt have any accomplices, still pretty crazy.

exactly, he actually went back and forth talking shit with the state department's twitter through his secret twitter page, takes a decent bit of know how to get away with that, I'm pretty sure they caught onto him after he tried to sneak his friend into syria
