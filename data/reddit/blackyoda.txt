Sorry MtGox was your first exchange. It is the largest and the worst  run in terms of security and customer service.   I will never put real$ in, or run a mill, but I would trade for goods and services.

Yup. Turn north pole into permanent lake and kill all snow babies!

Mtgox is not a bank. It is a "guy" in tokyo running an unregulated trading outpost with no TOS. There are a multitude of ways he could cheat and rip people off and get away with it and or tell us to fuck off. 
I could imagine there are some elements that might resort to more direct action to enforce "bitcoin justice".
I don't know what the fuck is going on like anyone else, but I do know that they have not been forthcoming with a believable accounting of everything that has happened (including events back in January of 2011).

If you heard nothing it might mean someone else has already successfully claimed your account.

MagicalTux = Mark COckler = Owner of MtCox

I am going to wear diapers Friday evening so I don't shit my chair laughing when mtgox crashes again after a brief life.
@_date: 2011-11-25 17:06:20
In Portland?
@_date: 2011-06-23 07:38:08
how it is going to crash is such a good question because this site has crashed out in so many different and craptaculous ways.
@_date: 2011-06-23 06:45:35
Just starting to?
@_date: 2011-10-16 00:20:51
Hahaha nice try mtcocks.

Sorry sometimes the blackness overwhelms me.
It is an interesting effort.
There was a cool story on NPR about 'you people' yesterday. It was actually pretty neat you can buy a sandwich in NYC with bitcoins.
make me a sammich why not? Put your money where my mouth is!

In your sad dreams.

It almost looks like a bag of vaginas. Especially the bottom pic.
@_date: 2011-06-23 04:59:52
The fact that it comes from multiple accounts is what makes it interesting. I think it is more likely than not that someone chose the amounts carefully to come up with that sequence of numbers.
We'll never know unless mr shady mtgox Mark Kerples opens his books... 
Anyone who banks/trades/invest with this guy is a fool. I know because it takes one to know one. Except I'm a different kind of fool, I don't bank with him.
@_date: 2011-06-27 21:03:24
lol, the only reason people still have an account with mtgox is to get all their money out, right?
@_date: 2011-11-03 14:29:49
That is and idiotic poster.
@_date: 2011-06-23 19:57:10
This seems like a holy fuck the universe caved in let's do something anything to pretend like the rest of the holes in the site are plugged!!! Hey it's cool to add this, but it's also cool to sprinkle sugar crystals on poop.
@_date: 2011-06-23 23:34:38
If these statistics carry you know MtGox guy/Mark Kerples is shitting his pants for joy.
@_date: 2011-08-25 15:22:40
Yeah if you spent your mining rig build money on apple stock you would earn a lot more money in the long run.
@_date: 2011-06-23 20:00:44
Totally agree with this! But - security is so bad, the skills so low, the site is an evolution of a magic card trading site - If a person should continue to use this site then that individual must be intellectually challenged.
@_date: 2011-08-20 14:34:09
because you are all fucking stupid.
@_date: 2011-06-23 16:07:47
Dude are you my sock puppet? I have started referring to this as mtcox too in other thread like communication mediums.
@_date: 2011-06-22 03:01:05
This isn't quite transparency, let's call it translucent. True transparency (for this issue) will come when mr. scumbag mtgox guy opens up his accounting books and has a CPA audit his mother fucking ass. If he is not willing to do that and people are still willing to give him money, well now that's funny.

Lol. And Obama is going to disclose the existence of extra terrestrials and the secret interstellar war we've been fighting for 60+ years.
@_date: 2011-08-25 15:12:09
ok for real I apologize for posting a douchey comment... It is a revolutionary concept and deserves it's chance to play out and no matter what it has had a tremendous impact. 
But you can still buy me a sammich.
