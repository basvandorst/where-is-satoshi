Optimizing the process is also important for scaling. If nodes can't validate blocks fast enough, the bitcoin network as a whole won't be able to support higher transaction rates.

FWIW, the paper that post links to has disappeared (404 error).
It appears you can find the paper [here]( now

The 1 sat/B fee is very low. Recent blocks have just recently started confirming transactions in the 0-5 range. There are a lot of transactions with higher fees waiting to be confirmed before yours unfortunately.

It may never confirm. It's been a while since 1 sat/B transactions confirmed on a regular basis.
Depending on your wallet, you may be able to create a new transaction with a higher fee. Usually transactions that don't confirm drop out of the mempool, but your wallet might also be retransmiting it as well.

I've been a Coinbase customer for a couple of years now. I've had a recurring buy for that entire time. Out of the blue, I received an email that my recurring buy failed and the reason was that I've exceeded my daily limit of $25.
I haven't touched this recurring buy in a long time and I never received any emails that my daily limit was changed. Just that it is now failing.
I sent a support request and later that day I was bumped to a surprisingly high daily limit.
So while it was resolved quickly, I'm still unsure why it happened in the first place.
