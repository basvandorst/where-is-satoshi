None of the full nodes trust the blockchain, or each other. That's why they verify it. Look up how to run a full node to learn about how you can verify the integrity of the network without trusting anyone.

The easiest way to start is using coinbase. If you're in the usa you're gonna have to show them your ID and your face unfortunately. Just buy some there to get used to the idea of getting crypto. If you have a good gaming GPU you can also mine some altcoins if you're not comfortable with that other method. For me to be able to do this I had to accept that it's possible all of the money I put in would just disappear, and you should always have that mindset. Never put in more than you're willing to lose. Even if it's $10 that's enough to get started, though you'll have to get something like litecoin or ethereum at that amount because of how high transaction fees on bitcoin are. If you're serious about using coinbase I can send you an affiliate link that will give us both $10 if you buy more than $100 worth, or you can find many affiliate links online. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.

The thing that gives me pause for using a laptop with wifi capabilities is that I have to trust that my copy of the software is not compromised. For how much work and how tiring it is getting thinking about these problems I'm beginning to think that I can draw the line at trusting that Ubuntu isn't trying to rob me, but if there's a reasonable way to avoid needing that trust I'd prefer to use it. There's some interesting discussion related to bitkey that i linked to in the subreddit I created that goes into further detail on this. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:54:09
Day to day sure, but they're valid as currencies in and of themselves. That's why bitcoin has grown in value over time an why bitconnect is basically worthless. I subscribe to the "when you're ready you won't have to trade your btc for dollars" school of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:14:43
Sure, that's probably true, I still think things are gonna go sideways for at least a few more months. There's a kinda obvious pattern where stuff experiences these speculative bubbles about once a year and we just had that.

You can fight bad marks on your credit many ways. Contest the charges as fraudulent and document everything. They'll fuck up the requirements for documentation eventually and you can use that to make the bad marks go away. Ask for credit repair advice on finance or just Google it.

@_date: 2018-02-01 16:03:11
Seems unlikely. I remember reading that mining stops being profitable around 7k, so that should be a hard lower limit, or has the price gone below the value of mining beforw?

It's true though. If you're politically above board it's hard to go after you.

@_date: 2018-03-11 02:20:19
I feel like that's not enough to explain the growth and time frame. Usually coins will stay around the same value and not go up, or experience a speculative bubble and then crash and never come back up, or if it's a blatant scam they'll go on a strong upward trend until the insiders exit, but I don't know that there's a central authority controlling XMR, and it usually happens in less than a year AFAIK.

Typically Bitcoin is accepted Irl for significant markup for the reasons mentioned. It's not regulated so it's highly prone to speculation bubbles. That said it's value over time has continued on a very aggressive trend since it started, so it's not a bad idea to hold for a few years if you do manage to get someone to buy motorcycles with it.

There's plenty of these out there. What there isn't enough of is advanced security practice guides. Things that explain what the registry is, how to see if you've been hacked, how to use good tools, stuff like that. Also how to safely take money out when you're ready to cash in. Nobody seems to like to talk about that, dunno why. Possibly ideological reasons, but those are silly so I can't imagine it's just that.

I do. I've written 3 different posts asking for more guidance on what can be done in 3 different subreddits. If you know of anything please let me know. 
Here's the one really interesting use case I found as a financial product: direct lending to margin traders where your loan is programmatically protected from a default. Poloniex does this. I'm looking at the other exchanges to see if they do anything similar. 
There's also bitcoin faucets but that's more like work-for-bitcoin stuff. I heard about something relating to using bitcoin to pay miners and earning bitcoin through that somehow but I haven't found an more info relating to it since I saw one thread on it several weeks ago. 
Seriously  PM me if you know anything about this. Im not giving up yet.
