To get btc into circle go to the top right of the circle screen when you're logged in - where your name shows - click on your name and then select "Get Address". This address is only good for 1 use but you can get as many as you want.
Then go to coinbase (or wherever) and paste that address from circle into the field for the address to send to and send the btc.
To go the other way around, in coinbase (or wherever) go to your wallet area and find out how to get an address to deposit btc, generate the address and then copy it. Then in circle click on Send Money at the top of the screen and enter the btc deposit address from coinbase and click send.
That's it ...

None - use a local one on your own machine or device and back it up to offline storage or to a paper wallet. You do not control the private keys with an online wallet and if they go bust you're typically screwed.

Very good case for keeping your coins in a local wallet or offline ... have not heard one good thing about ANY online wallet and don't keep any of my coins there.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:55:36
Basically, download the wallet software for your OS and install it .. then send your BTC to one of the receiving addresses you create in your local wallet. Once that's done then just from that point forward send/receive from/to your local wallet instead of an online wallet. Check the sidebar for more info and downloads.
EDIT: Offline wallets are a little more complicated and I'm not familiar with using them.

I use WHMCS on one of my business sites and coinpayments.net for that - the site is built right on WHMCS, not a separate site.
In my other business site I use WordPress and the wp-ecommerce plugin.  I use cointopay.com, which is very easily integrated into the wp-ecommerce plugin and you can set it to automatically convert to fiat if desired and have cointopay deposit it directly into your bank account - or you can just leave it there and empty your wallet when you want.
In both cases, don't convert my coin-based sales, I keep the coins and put them on the market when/if I want to. :)
EDIT: CoinToPay is also insured but in any case NEVER leave your coins in an online wallet.

Epic .... :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:36:03
WOW - I must say - this is AWESOME!
I never used Circle before and after reading the article went and created a Circle account, added my bank and cc accounts, deposited $5 USD and then withdrew BTC to my local BTC wallet all in less than 5 minutes - incredible!  I am impressed :)
Hopefully they'll put PayPal out of business cause PayPal sucks!

All banks are threatened by Bitcoin - they should be embracing it not running from it.
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:21:36
Banks and governments definitely feel threatened by Bitcoin.  The majority also doesn't understand it, although it seems like some do - and it scares them.  They  do, however, realize that if the non-techie population starts to understand and use it they are going to lose their choke-hold on the economy and citizens and that scares the shit out of them.  So they put it down and make it sound like the only use it has is illegal activities.  Unfortunately, in general, people are stupid and lazy and won't take the time to educate themselves on the subject - so the easy way is to just believe what they are told, even though it's to their detriment - and that's what the politicians and banking industry are counting on.

Here's how to proceed - get rid of PayPal altogether - it's a ripoff and they don't protect their business customers, just the purchasers ... don't get me started LOL.

I'm still mining and no problems here - using (1) 14mh GPU on X11 and 4 gridseeds mining scrypt only.  I use trademybit for the x11 and do about 0.004 btc per day and the gridseeds I switch around between BC, VIA, MYR and DRK.
I also have my rigs listed on Mining Rig Rentals and even though that stops them from mining for me, I get btc out of the rentals - I have no complaints.  The gridseeds are the least power usage but also the least coins coming in.
Just letting them all chug right along and hodling for the long term on everything :)

PayPal sucks - they don't protect their business clients like they should.  Run away from them as fast as possible!
Take crypto instead and convert it to fiat - I just got on board with cointopay - very easy integration and very helpful.  Customers pay via crypto and can be converted to a couple different fiats automatically, or stored in your wallet until you decide to convert.
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:45:01
It depends on which side of the fence you're on with PayPal - if your a business/merchant forget it, PayPal does NOT protect businesses in any way, shape or form.  With PAyPal businesses are always looked at by them as the crooks and scammers and as we all know that definitely is NOT the case ALL the time.
If you're a consumer PayPal protects you to the end.  I wouldn't be so down on PayPal if they only gave the same amount of protection to their business clients as they do to their consumer clients.  PayPal was great in the beginning and then eBay bought them and it all went downhill from there.
So I only use them when absolutely necessary.

That's why you should always get a dedicated server for any business - not shared hosting.  With a dedicated server where you have root access you can lock it down tight via the firewall, etc.
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:07:10
All good points - and I wasn't trying to be  smart ass but after I re-read my post it sounded that way - sorry about that :)
Cash is very anonymous - depending upon how you get it in the first place LOL.
Actually I don't think crypto will ever replace fiat completely, I think they will co-exist and serve different purposes .. but it'll give it a run for it's money (no pun intended - wait yes it was LOL).
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:55:42
Hmmm .. well just a thought :)

I have both my cc (actually debit card) and my bank info in Circle, was never asked for any ID of any kind, and have done about 10 transactions through them with absolutely no problem - in fact I did one 2 days ago with no issue at all.
The only thing I don't like about it is you can't specify a price to buy at - other than that I've had no issues whatsoever using them.
And I don't leave anything in there - I make my purchase and send it to my local wallet.  I haven't tried exchanging btc for fiat yet - yes I'm in the USA.
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:12:55
If PayPal didn't suck so bad I might consider putting some thought into this ... but ... just more FUD from uneducated people ... banks and payment processors aren't understanding Bitcoin and that scares them - so what's the best response?  Put it down so it doesn't take money out of their pockets.  Like a bunch of firggin politicians ... Oh, did I mention that PayPal sucks bigtime and isn't worth the time it would take to worry  about it? :)
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:07:26
It's kinda greenish :)

Well these are just my opinions but for one thing, banks do way more than just make money off remittance and transfer fees - do you honestly believe when you make a deposit the money is just put into their vault and held there until you want it again?  Come on ... they invest it ... repeatedly, and barely pay out anything in interest on interest-bearing accounts.  They also charge numerous fees for just about anything they can think of having to do with doing business with them - monthly checking account fees, credit card fees, loan fees, etc., etc., etc.
With BTC (or any crypto) they would have nothing to invest, nothing to loan, etc. - UNLESS the adopt it.
If cryptocurrency becomes widely accepted and the general public realizes that crypto was easier, no fees and couldn't be traced (no matter how honest you are), why would they use a bank?  And the banks know this.  I, for one, would rather have control of my money/crypto than trusting somebody else with it and I think there are a lot of others in the world who feel this as well - that's why little old ladies pile money under the mattress LOL.
As far as government - I think it's going to be difficult if not near impossible for them to regulate taxes on cryptocurrency due to the very simple fact of the anonymity associated with it.
Example 1 - prove I purchased something that is taxable using fiat ... easy ... paper trails are all over: checks, bank statements, etc.
Example 2 - prove I bought something taxable with Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.  No paper trail, no nothing - so how do they tax it?  They can't.  They have to rely on the honesty of the general public and if the general public is as honest as the politicians we're all in trouble LMAO.
Again - just my 2 mBTC but this is how I see it.  I'm not saying I'm 100% correct, but if I wasn't at least partially correct we wouldn't be reading all the dumb and inaccurate stories every day and government lackeys wouldn't be trying to figure out how to regulate it so they get their cut along with their banking cronies :)

You get your BTC with Circle as soon as you buy. Problem with Snapcard is they limit what banks you can use - I use a small local bank and couldn't add a bank account because snapcard didn't recognize the bank ... not very convenient :(
EDIT: And no android app ... -2 :(
