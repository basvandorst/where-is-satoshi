Do you have priest to choirboy feelings for 	Luke
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:13:57
If you're so smart why aren't you a billionaire then. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:05:46
That's really stupid
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:06:09
Yep. And if the community of 18 assholes I mean users threatens to UASF to get SegWit they might also get a hard fork. Surprise! 8.1.2017. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:07:59
Why is the market cap in the billions then
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:12:07
I was hoping to get your private key but started slow. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:14:53
They're going to keep forking out coin
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:09:20
Someone who 	actually does what they spew on Reddit
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:12:38
No proof
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:06:16
Who cares? Get a job. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:38:31
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:23:58
That's just your opinion man
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:03:41
Oh hi Samson. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:18:06
People who want smaller blocks have the right to hard fork too. Will be taking Luke with you?
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:20:04
It's hash rate and UASF got destroyed there. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:07:31
What about now? Did we lose to Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:23:59
Haters gonna hate. You hodling?
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:10:47
Did we fuck ourselves with UASF? Why did Bitcoin Cash hard fork on the same date?
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:17:55
This is why so many Chinese think Bitcoin Core boys are racist
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:13:12
Bitcoin Cash hard forked August 1st thanks to UASF?
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:09:30
Who's supporting Bitcoin Cash? How is it at such a high market cap?
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:02:07
Sounds hypocritical to me. Maybe stop?
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:02:09
Why is Coinbase responsible for their customers' taxes? The customers who earned taxable income trading crypto are the ones in the most trouble, no?
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:16:12
That's some passive aggressive death wish bro
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:11:35
Without UASF there is no Bitcoin Cash hard fork on August 1st. Fml
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:01:23
Yeah, who cares. Starbucks didn't exist a few decades ago. I'm talking about real life right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:54:17
You are way too sensitive. Pray more. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:12:28
Bitcoin Cash hard forked August 1 thanks to UASF
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:12:31
Or sell hats
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:25:00
He meant good arguments
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:13:06
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:17:18
Do you use Coinbase? What's your public key?
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:17:17
If you just move it th	ts not taxable. Problem is exchanging BTC for ETH is taxable. Users are fucked. IRS can pop this bubble anytime. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:07:02
Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:00:55
What about a 15 year old
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:22:45
Then why are the altcoins with more than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:11:42
13 year-old bots
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:11:08
In fairness 1 of the pathetic losers at least has a job as community manager and makes ten cents on each Made In China hat he sells 
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:13:21
Lies. Prove it. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:25:40
Yes. Or No
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:31:45
Get a life instead
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:38:28
	And now you never will
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:08:00
Store of value backed by USD.  CEO is a genius like Karpeles and Samson Mow. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:25:01
Your imagination. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:19:52
Hold them all
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:08:14
I meant Tonejays. He has a great face for radio
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:19:24
They are still dealing with it
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:09:44
It's ok. You'll be fine
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:22:57
Have you read Waiting For SegWit
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:16:12
Have ever made money ��
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:50:58
And difficulty. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:57:13
Many assholes in Bitcoin. More forks coming. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:09:07
Stop posting about altcoins you birch. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:31:07
Tone's Tone is Vay Bad
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:37:50
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:20:54
Calm down. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:11:55
So $10 b market cap
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:26:31
Cash works at Starbucks bro
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:12:33
Frogolocalypse is Luke and not very successful
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:59:43
Is he retarded or just Aspie
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:41:36
That was double agent Samson Mow who worked for BTCC and got dumb guys to support UASF and then started Bitcoin Cash behind the scenes.  Sneaky!
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:24:43
You should short BCC if you are so sure
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:11:12
Wrong again. You will have more hard forks because billions in market cap for forked coins. Bad for Bitcoin. You fucked up. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:32:39
Blockstream is a subsidiary of AXA which is a big bank
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:14:19
Wearing a Made In China UASF hat?
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:02:05
- I need Litecoin to have a reason to exist
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:26:37
Yes. Sounds like Bitcoin Core and big blockers need to get divorced. Bad blood and low EQ all over the place. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:20:49
Also you will sound less like a little bitch
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:39:28
The UASF folks?
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:36:17
Wow SegWit2XHF is happening. NYA winning. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:33:46
Aren't we losing to SegWit2XHF?
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:59:02
Are you just also pointing out a problem (OP whining) but offering no solution either? My solution: Maybe you should stop posting whines about whines. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:41:09
UASF smaller than I thought. I can't believe  was wrong about Twitter and Reddit posts and polls being inaccurate! Fml
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:33:03
Oh thank God they have the wrong person!
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:37:46
