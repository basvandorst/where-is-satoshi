Right except not everyone gets an equal vote on what is valuable.
If you have a higher market share, a higher perceived worth, you get a higher say on what policy is.
"The Market" is just another word for Game Theory.

While i agree that it is practical, i think it is highly risky and open to manipulation.
Nations need currency for proper political function. If the national currency is worthless then other currencies are used instead.
If Bitcoin is favored over other monies it could lead to a lot of bizarre consequences for labor and service based economies.
I think its crazy that money is a business unto itself now. Banking is supposed to make trade and production possible. But an international currency based on how many computers are mining it seems to completely negate the human element.
Its like the Federal reserve printing money when it feels like it. Its not beholden to anyone.

I understand why people like Bitcoin. Its an internationally available currency.
But its kind of disturbing how its not weighted by anything physical. I would ban it in my country if i didn't have a strong reserve...

I appreciate what you're saying, but i think the idea that the market is what should decide is a bad idea.
People control the markets. Markets don't control the people.

So who gets to choose what the value of money is?
The people generating the money.

Negative. 
I think the US Constitution said it best "No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility."
Bitcoin's value is based around decryption of information. Code in a computer. Its not a real currency. Nothing is backing it.
