It would be great if you could accept reality:
1) BFX got hacked and yes, their security system wasnt good enough. Hence, indeed, it is their fault and they accepted resonsibility.
2) The bitfinex team seems to be a team of young entrepreneurs who try to create a big and sustainable company. However, they still do not have high profits.
3) They want to be giving customers as much money back as possible while continuing operations - to also make customers 100% whole over time with the profits generated.
We should accept this solution as 64% now is way better than getting nothing over many years like in the MtGox and bitcoinica case (I have bad personal experience in those).
Yes, we would all have liked to get 100% back now, but the more hurdles we create the longer it takes and less we get back.
So let's swallow this bullet and move on. The moment bitfinex is up again, we may see a big bitcoin rally...

That could be a great option. I might be open to accept some equity stake to get compensated for possible losses

I think the best way out of this would be for bitfinex to cover all losses (i.e. via getting investors backing, etc.). Otherwise the lawsuits following their attempt to deploy a haircut would lead to years of blocked funds and consuming a lot of what is left with legal fees.

Also, bitfinex employees may end up being prosecuted as well. Not threatening, just saying.

you may be right that this could happen, but then we agree, that we both do not prefer this option
