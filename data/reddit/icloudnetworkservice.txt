Hi Tim,  I'm working on a start up project, bitcoin social networking community, it's name called Bitcoind, it is similar to facebook, you can share your activity, blogs, photos, video and you can create your favorite groups, join bitcoin forum and so on, Site still under construction, but you can check it ** for a first look.
