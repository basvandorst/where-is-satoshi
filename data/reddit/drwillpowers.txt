Thanks for the clarification, I thought it was done at all of them but I was too lazy to check before posting that.

You do realize at every landing mission they set up reflectors at the position they landed.  You can check rather easily yourself to see if they really work at any major observatory. So yeah, deny all you want but science prevails here.

Safe deposit boxes are fine if your seed/keys are encrypted. It's one of the three places I've split my keys now post a house fire where a trezor in a fire safe saved my ass.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:00:50
This is why the trezors are in two different safes now (in two different locations) and the seed words are in a safety deposit box at a bank.

A plugged in but off massage chair. Was working perfectly for 6 months prior.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:48:45
I already did! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:16:20
Yeah, hasn't been great. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:59:37
Yes, that's me. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:03:55
Indoor only yes. Thank you. I'm crushed. We can't even look at photos of them yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:30:10
how much money do you have in your bank account? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:22:13
1.8 trillion attempts, about a week!
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:12:28
This is national news. I offered 100k reward for my cats when we thought they escaped and didn't die in the fire. Google cats+bitcoin. It's not much of a secret. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:15:08
The new house has an automatic halatron system being built into it. The reason our house burned was due to a failure of a hydrant and the rest being far away. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:13:56
Correct 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:48:55
Thank you. We tried to be as transparent as possible about everything as people wanted to support us fiscally. I just ask they support the shelter instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:02:11
I have some magic the gathering cards to sell you.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:41:03
I wish that were true. But it's my actual life and I'm sharing it to try and help others. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:59:46
Massage chair .  Plugged in but off.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:00:15
Sadly 2 died and one we haven't found presumed dead. I couldn't find them before the FD dragged me out. I was being irrational about how long I was in the fire hunting for them.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:12:03
We cashed that out at about 4500 and made the new 1catcafe address =)
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:24:10
Send me a PM. I'm not sure what that is yet. Pardon me while I google. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:55:16
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:29:56
awesome, thanks for sharing. This made all the difference! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:02:19
I made sure my friend who was staying at the house escaped. After that, I went on the hunt for my 3 boys. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:54:03
Testing it. Had no laptop as all was incinerated. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:35:39
Its too late for that, its international news:

Hashrate doesn't indicate network strength. Unique nodes and transaction volumes do. As technology improves, hashrate will always go up. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:13:21
Pretty much the same thing that gives fiat value. People mutually agree it's worth x and are willing to exchange goods for it at level x. 
It additionally has features that fiat does not have, but effectively it has value because people say it does. That's true of nearly any tangible object. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:56:08
Is it just me or is the girl he's checking out the same girl he's currently with?
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:39:05
Sure, another one could. Just as the Yen replicates the USD. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:29:07
That was assuredly not the case with my original S1s which made me ROI many many times over for their cost to coins gained.
@_date: 2019-02-27 04:04:46
also, you do realize that people can see your post history right? And so they can see photographs of you that clearly demonstrate that youre white? 
Lol screenshot taken. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:19:13
Phone has been ringing off the hook since we turned on the phone system, I'm booked out for weeks so far! 
@_date: 2019-02-27 04:02:01
Knock yourself out, there isn't anything wrong with having an opinion. You're entitled to yours. many of my patients come from disadvantaged populations and don't feel comfortable going to a doctor because they have been treated poorly in the past by the medical system. As a result, making an office feel friendly and welcoming to them is a good thing. it's especially a good thing if someone will come to the Doctor who would otherwise not go because they felt uncomfortable. So screenshot all you want. I have no shame in that.

Farmington Hills Michigan, Powers Family Medicine
@_date: 2019-02-26 03:38:31
I'm not an MD, I'm a DO. If Steve Jobs had gone and gotten surgery like he should have, he'd still be alive today. That's a terrible example to use. ultimately, he did go and get the surgery done, but it was too late. But that did extend his life span.
old Chinese herbs are still just herbs of which we can easily extract the necessary medicines. If there's something in them which is superior to modern medicine, we would have already extracted it and patented it and sold it because that's how capitalism works. I think the one thing you did say was exercise, and admittedly, that overwhelmingly is the best treatment for nearly everything.  All of the treatments that I give people are entirely evidence-based. and not to toot my own horn, but I am the highest ranked family doctor in the state of Michigan regards to patient evaluations. I must be doing something right.
That being said, there are plenty of egotistical idiot doctors who think they know everything and end up killing people. I think what makes me different than most other doctors is the fact that I know that I don't know everything, but I accept that, and I do my best to learn as much as I possibly can. I like being wrong as it means that I've learned something new. I know what I don't know. it's the person who doesn't know that they don't know something and believes that they do that really is dangerous.
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:22:05
yeah but neither of the above posters probably have any idea what that means, they just want their reiki. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 21:53:17
Nah, I'm going to keep doing what i'm doing as literally everyone so far I've encountered here has loved it. When people feel welcomed and comfortable in a space, they are a lot more likely to open up and be honest with me which helps me do a better job. You're probably a white, cis, heterosexual male who feels comfortable everywhere and so you cant imagine going to the doctor being an awful scary experience. But hey, do what makes you happy. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:10:02
Okay this is hilarious, I posted my office to reddit last week and nobody cared.  I was randomly browsing r/Bitcoin tonight trying to figure out why the most recent drop occurred (as if there is ever a reason) and saw this. 
I'm not trying to advertise for patients on Reddit, but if you browse my profile it's pretty easy to find my office information if you're in Michigan. the entire office is themed around video games and we accept Bitcoin via bitpay as well as directly. I'm currently trying to work out the legal issue with my lawyer on accepting it and holding it. speculating on it makes the tax situation a lot more difficult than simply accepting it via bitpay. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:06:19
Doctor has no school loans anymore. I still hold some, but it's pretty much changed my life.
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:04:56
So this is pretty funny, as it's actually my office and I randomly stumbled onto this post while browsing I posted my office to Reddit last week and nobody cared. 
It's not an insane desktop, ryzen 7 with an rx570 in it. But it's got a 4k monitor. Window facing webcam is to take pics for charts.
No excuses on the stapled cord though. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 03:59:57
Someday the majority will!

I'm taking you to karma court for your lies. 
Don't worry, I took a screenshot of it just in case you delete it
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:07:29
I'm sorry, I'm a vulture because I accept payment for services? Sorry but in the USA we don't have universal healthcare and I cant pay my employees with hopes and dreams. We have to make money as a business in order to function as an office. The operating overhead for this place is well over 100k a year, but I'm a vulture. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:08:59
because capital gains also gets calculated if I hold it for gains. Then that gets calculated out of the base cost for EACH TRANSACTION. Its a lot of calculations. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:16:19
"always been proven". Looks like I just disproved your point.
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:18:50
I do offer a free switch in a drawing for people who give referrals, but no gaming tournaments held here yet! 
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:05:34
You would be exceptionally wrong. I'm about as evidence-based as you can possibly imagine. No hippie shit in my office. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 03:59:40
You do realize that literally any doctor can get the aahivm certification right? 
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:21:23
So boring office decorations and taupe paint on everything will make me a better doctor? Thanks, but I'm the highest ranked family doctor in my state, and I didn't get there through roku tvs in the exam rooms. Offering my patients a welcoming and friendly experience is part of caring for them. The other part is good medicine. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:09:12

Plain old family medicine, then HIV/LGBT care and transgender hormonal therapy.

I hear you, I've been watching the situation for a while now. The idea that people were playing RuneScape to try and eat showed how dystopian it had become. I really hope things get better for you guys soon.

Me and my wife just laughed until tears at this. If you can't laugh at your own misery then what else can you do? 
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:45:36
these are the people who don't believe we landed on the moon even when there are laser reflectors present. No matter how much you try and explain to this guy that you're just following your Constitution and all of the nations who accepted the new interim president are also just following your Constitution, he's not going to listen. Thanks for being a voice of reason though. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:49:20
Thanks, it was an incredible amount of debt that would have taken us 30 years to pay off and it's just gone. Bitcoin changed our lives forever. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 00:48:36
Those are desktop motherboards. Whatever they were mining it wasn't Bitcoin. Some GPU coin maybe. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:59:31
If I followed that advice I wouldn't have paid off my wifes and my own undergraduate, graduate and medical school loans with Bitcoin. Having a little skin in the game as a hedge isn't unreasonable.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:23:34
Yep thats two undergrad and two med-school debts combined. 
All gone now thanks to years of mining and hodling. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:22:25
Me and my wife owed $550,000 in student loans due to going to medical school. we're both family doctors, and they don't make that much anymore. We were looking at decades to pay it all off. Thanks to bitcoin, it's all gone. I don't know what we would have done.
