vision of bitcoin is to fight these kinda gambling so called fincancial markets.
i do hope that bitcoin will give  a fight this year and hopeufully will crash the whole futures trading

this is a good read
thx alot for it
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:22:49
i dont understand this shit..
They wanne talk about crypto's but trading in futures is no problem?
what a world what a world
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:11:05
no supprise here..
The finiancial markets seeing easy money being made.. so they are adding the gambling ( futures) to their business.
simple reminder.. all these fcking asswhipes made the current economy with their so called structured idea's on the financial market. THIS IS COMPLETE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT BITCOIN STANDS FOR
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:35:15
futures is basicly gambling with nothing.. its thin air
do you think bitmex even holds any coins?
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:14:12
prime example of trading nothing but air
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:27:06
the people who ruined the current economy with all their financial constructions trying to ruin it once more
no supprise here..
you either buy the coins or not.. and not some fiction paper who are claiming you "own a coin " in the future.
this whole futures contruction is complete the opposite of what bitcoin stands for..
hopefully this is backfire hard on them.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:40:30
im not sure this counts for bitcoin tho.
futures is underlying system, for me basicly gambling with thin AIR..
bitcoin is pure ask and demand // Miners
if im wrong.. pls tell me.. 
Trading in futures is complete different then actually be in possession of a bitcoin..
So how are futures traders gonna impact the bitcoin value then?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:07:57
is this a joke?
bitcoin aint shares man.. its a currency lik EU and USD
but i do understand that some people wanne eat from the pie and putting up another finance idea to sit on the table..
Hopefully the government dont  intervine since guys like your already fcked up the economy
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:21:18
this article is pretty spot on..
they way i see LN : its nothing more then a delay on the network.. postphoning transactions and combining them together in order to reduce stress on the blockchain.
tbh.. i think blockchain is broken tech since it cant be global
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:19:45
the idea of bitcoin was to replace money... which many believe its still is. while in reality the blockchain tech comes short on this matter.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:07:15
who is laughing now? are you dumb or what?
a smart person makes profit of these crashes and cashes our on the correct time
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:33:28
no im talking about volume 24 hours..
meaning more being trade in 24 hours.. less coins avail.. price going up
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:23:19
i use the term delay or combine since the LN works offchain and is not doing anything else then that.. 
Meaning its delaying the blockchain transactions in order to reduce stress on the blockchain by combining transactions into channels
The blockchain itself cant not handle x times transactions per sec..
i call it broken tech others call it development.
on the other hand they need to find a sollution to the problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:02:01
fundamentals of blockchain: decentralisation/secrurity
layers that are build upon the blockchain are not or less
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:59:27
pls explain then.. i see market trade increasing with over 1 billion within 24 hours..
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:17:39
i am dutch.. and these statements of a local dutch court dont mean shit when holland needs to listen to the EU.
we are a small country.. we have no impact on a upcoming world currency like bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:24:28
that idea failed if the blockchain cant support millions of users aka transactions in a sec.
I understand they are trying to fix scaling problem with LN.. but it should be the blockchain itself who needs fixing.. not building layers ontop of the blockchain..
So i call it broken tech
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:09:00
if you see marketcoin cap volume went up with 1 billion (
meaning more people are trading buying bitcoins.
meaning less bitcoin avail.. so price is going up?
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:46:14
ow ok
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:13:46
gekko is doing his stuff atm..
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:24:09
i would like to hear more of your vision
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:52:52
prolly buying tonight.. currently @ work..
my vision is long term tho, kinda hoping for the price going above 3k with the new adjustments
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:59:28
im kinda new but with this new feature segwit, from what i understand.. aint this complete contra argument of what bitcoins stands for : 
With segwit, the amount of coins increases, which also means it can be regulated.
Or i am complete wrong?
@_date: 2017-07-18 11:53:17
you buying then? or waiting?
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:43:40
so.. bitcoin price prolly going up then?
I was kinda hoping it would drop more before 2 august before i would by some..
Buy or not to buy?!
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:18:47
this is a joke  or actually true?
