And now - 7 days later: 
2017-03-30 01:18:00 UTC
The pool found a private key to 7d89ad89cd10a3867b8f6bfc803838fa101b598b (1CSnQ1LnY37rwz8ezJn5xQrCrifZxExpWV) as 0x5e1667c899783. At the time of the find, there were 0.00001 BTC on that address.The funds were transferred to custody at 1Dg1XnH9BLKFf4XrWioYsxDJjSxr996Miq .
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:11:10


This has happened too, but it's not mentioned on the trophies page. The two addresses found predate the pool inception.
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:32:54
50 bits keys, not 160 bits.
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:28:14
except we don't pick the keys randomly.
@_date: 2017-03-23 06:57:56
He does - if you read the text to the end. ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:10:04
Depends on the hardware and the software. :-) There was a plan for a LBC client called Kardashev...
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:13:36
You can stop after the ripemd160. The subsequent sha256(sha256(x)) you mention are only checksum computations for the base58 representation and do not add any security at all. The hash160 is relevant and as such it has only 160bits of entropy.
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:14:37
That would certainly be a nice computer to have. :-) And until then, there would also be certainly 25 milliion addresses with funds. At the moment there are only 14 million. LBC is doing slightly over 600 Mkeys/s right now.
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:02:39
You would prefer such projects to happen in the dark? You dismiss a fact that there are - every second - over 300 million keys (as of now) checked each single one against the 11 million addresses with funds on them? Is Bitcoin still secure? Sure it is, maybe this project will even prove it. What I stated are the facts, there is nothing misleading in my posts.
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:22:00
Not good enough. I don't mean the 0.1 BTC - that's a nice sum. Also we do not even need the page offset. But before we move the cannons away from other targets, I would like to see the transaction or the BTC Address as minimal proof you actually are not pulling our leg(s).
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:51:45
You could say the 50 "do not count", because they are part of the puzzle transaction and as such probably intended to be found (canary in the coalmine). However, the pool has found 2 addresses with funds that do predate the pool inception. Both uncompressed addresses. Now either these were created by bad wallets, or the pool is extremely lucky, or we will have to revisit our perception of P2PKH address safety. The main motivation behind doing what the pool does is that it's considered "impossible". With this, everyone has dismissed to undertake such a feat - maybe overlooking something in the course.
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:40:29
You are wrong. Unfortunately.
    4:28:19 PM   ryan-c  anyway, to attack p2sh, you create a keypair, then generate transactions in the form of 'OP_1 [uncompressed pubkey] [02+32 byte nonce] OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG'
    4:30:17 PM   ryan-c   init sha256, feed in first 64 bytes, save intermediate state, then run a loop restoring the intermediate state, incrementing the nonce, and adding the rest of the script into sha256, then ripemd160 the final hash
    4:32:03 PM   ryan-c  you don't have to do *any* elliptic curve operations in the loop, only hash cracking
    4:32:14 PM   ryan-c  and trivial memory requirements
    4:33:04 PM   ryan-c  would be easy to gpuify
    4:33:10 PM   ryan-c  so, yeah
    4:33:18 PM   ryan-c  p2sh isn't more secure than p2pkh
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:27:15
When it comes to big numbers, people do have the tendency to get them wrong, so I was merely clarifying, because your numbers were way off. If it was about the message - yes - the LBC has searched a minuscule part of the total search space so far. I think the post mentions that (read "negligible amount"). Nevertheless, it is so far the biggest (public) project of PK brute search and it has results - also it's getting faster!
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:38:24
Actually just trying to put your "grains of sand" comparison into perspective as it may evoke a "slow search process". BTW - the LBC started out with 300.000 keys/s and is today - 6 months later - 1000times faster. What the pool managed to search in it's first 2 months of operation, today a notebook can do in 2 hours.

Getting personal is really bad taste. So while I have to assume you have been told to be "just fucking dumb" too often in your life and now you need to vent it ... I nevertheless put an explaining link to the "puzzle transaction" so people can - quickly - look it up.
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:10:26


How can you be so sure? What makes a collision more improbable?
BTW: The pool has found it's 3rd address.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:42:30
Do your research and find out who set up the pool.
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:03:44
You are aware there are only 48 orders of magnitude in Bitcoin search space? You may want to get your numbers right. Reduce the electronic radiation space by 36 orders of magnitude: That's the space they've brute forced so far.
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:06:04
Unlikely if you look at them. Also the 3rd address found now: No sign of "experiment", just a plain addres which pre-dates the pool inception. July 2016 - and uncompressed? Srsly?
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:15:35
It would take a year or so. If you are falsely assuming a 256bit entropy or even this pic:  ... well - then that's the wrong basis for your considerations.
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:10:53
You meant the "typical bitcoin private key". There is no such thing as the typical bitcoin private key. There are 2^96 private keys per address. That's what a collision is about - hence the name. See also the [theory]( behind the pool.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:07:51
You are aware that what the LBC does will not even spare your paper wallet?

Strength in numbers - eh? Now imagine you were young and had 60 years to live and you could check 128 grains of sand per second. Imagine further by some miraculous device/drugs you could spend every second of this life with this search. The LBC does perform the same search - at the current speed - in 12 minutes.
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:33:48

Maybe someone tried over 500 tn private keys, but certainly also only 500 tn resulting hash160 - namely those made from the compressed public keys.
The [Large Bitcoin Collider (LBC)]( has meanwhile generated over 300 tn private keys, but with both uncompressed and compressed public keys -&gt; over 600 tn hash160.
Also, the LBC is checking against **all** addresses with funds on them, not just those from the so-called puzzle transaction. As a direct result, the LBC has [found]( two addresses with funds on them already.

Well - my fellow coding apprentice - how would you handle the case where the client is potentionally compromised by code tampering (because available as an easy-in-editor-to-modify script) and any hard-coded operation of like "remove myself" could have been eliminated? And how actually is this more a loophole than the WHOLE code auto-updating itself?
@_date: 2017-04-14 21:51:58
No. Just the one it "hit".
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:13:42
You can try that "advice", and see what happens - when you client tries to send PoW to the server, it will get deleted from disk.
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:12:55
No, this was due to one man joining with an army of CPUs. There are about 15 people in the pool. We've barely started. As for scalability (to what speed) -&gt; instant search of the whole 2^256 keyspace would be possible with the server, it's just a matter how fast clients are.
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:08:24
*sigh* a) We have searched 2^52 addresses as we are looking at compressed and uncompressed public keys. b) We are looking at all 15.6 M addresses with funds on them  quasi-simultaneously -&gt; Search space 135.1 bits That means we have searched 1/2^83.1 of the possible address space. Still quite something to do, but c) we are not finished yet, d) just wanted to show how off you are (factor 2^26).
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:07:42

No - 6 months is the grace period. Actually consistent with finders fee regulations. If you are not checking your holdings at least once every 6 months it's a little bit of your problem - in the real world.

Right. But these calculations are moot. It took Bitcoin 8 years to go from 0 to 4 Exa-Hash/s. Anyone exercising in these funny "trillions of years" calculations has a very linear mind. (Which includes almost everyone). We are fighting an exponential function, but we also have exponential means of growth.

You have proven to think and guess wrong on several occasions now - within a very short text. It doesn't look like there is need to debate.
If you show me any other project that has come so far (~ 200 trillion keys/day = 400 tn addresses/d), I am willing to debate. Until then, let's just wait and see.

We are using CPUs mostly, with some few people running a GPU client. The GPU client also has potential for speed improvements, although it is already the fastest address generator on the planet.
Of course, when GPUs will reach their max. potential, we will look at FPGAs.

Except we are not looking just at the puzzle transaction addresses, but all 15.6 million addresses with funds on them. Heard of this 7500  BTC address lost in a landfill? It's also on the list. As is every single other address too. Those lost, are probably ours. Those belonging to someone (if he can prove it) will be given back.
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:14:36
Bitcoin is not "totally broken". We have to put in quite some effort to have any results at all. The point is - I believe - to show how good protected Bitcoin really is without the mystification.
tl;dr; It's very well protected (as far as we can see), but not as well as some pictures with suns on them want make you believe.
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:30:35


lol - seriously? And you do?




Yeah ... **per address!!!** Probably twice as many.
I guess you belong to the same category like the people laughing at Google for their AI efforts "not being worth consideration.", because - hey - you are smarter. Right?
You clearly fail to estimate exponential behavior correctly. Like 99.9% of the population.
All this "imagine you had 1000 trillion a day".
21 days ago, we had 330 Mkeys, which was also not worth consideration.
On stack exchange texts similar to yours start "Imagine you could generate 1Gkey/s"... like no one could imagine that in 2012. We had over 2 Gkeys/ the past days.
Hey - for me, it's perfectly ok to simply not give a periodic status report of the project. If people prefer not to know...

You can of course re-download and try again, reset the VM or whatever. And you can continue with that until either you or the server gets bored. Whichever comes first. ;-)

Most certainly you are not speaking about the LBC participants but those groups who do the same thing in the hiding?
If it's a statistical non-issue, no values could ever have been or will be hurt.
@_date: 2017-04-14 21:55:09
We have all the hash160 of addresses with funds on them in a data structure called "bloom filter". For each private key we generate two addresses (compressed and uncompressed) and these are checked against this bloom filter. So if you see on the stats page 2 Gkeys/s, it actually means 4 giga-addresses per second with **each** checked against 15.6 million addresses. As one can assume these 15.6M addresses to be uniformly distributed across the search space -&gt; 160 - log2(15M) bits
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:31:45
Threat model is simple: Modify the client, so it would claim to have done work (searching keyspace), which in fact it wouldn't - fake PoW and the like. Which is not malicious per se, but polluting the work-done database in the LBC server. And ultimately this could lead to overlook keys, because they were in an interval such a client faked.
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:39:13
Yes, the last resort (3rd line of defense) for code tampering, after plausibility checks, quine, internal quine breaches is a death kiss from the server where the client removes itself from the disk. So what? It's documented.
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:15:20

Where is "scam proof" in that the blockparser that is used in the process to generate the blf file stopped working with the new blockchain structure and I simply filed an issue on github?
"you can detect a lot of network activity" ... sounds like legit research
You are using LBC wrong. You cannot use it in sub-block range. (i.e. less than 16M keys)
If you want to run around shouting "SCAM" - I am not stopping you. But you cannot expect me to discuss then anything with you.
And the generator code is not published, because I will not stuff my pretty fast code (as you probably figured out at least 2 times faster than brainflayer) in your little squealers ass.
