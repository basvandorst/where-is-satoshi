The existence of the weak is what allows power hungry parasites to thrive.  
If we agree that this is human nature then its not the parasites that are to blame and the only way out of it is the extinction of the weak (through education).

What you're preaching is nothing more than "we all die, eventually".

Money is not destructive, it is the people's love for money that is destructive.  
Resources are not a common good, you are not owned a part of the planet just because you were born. You want something you need to find a way to get it.    
Good ideas don't need money to be implemented.  All big tech companies were started from a garage or from a whitepaper.  
The physical world is about structure and structure has a center which means we need a way to find the fittest individuals that get to occupy the center and that is through competition. You either play the game or wine about it, its not going to change.

A government represents (in theory) its people. The wealth of a government is that of the country it represents. An entity becomes bankrupt when it has no assets but as long as the country exists there will always be assets. The biggest asset are people and their work.

If you continue to make blanked statements about some hidden truth which only you and a few select people "know" don't be surprised when you're meet with skepticism. Fortunately I am able to understand what you're saying despite your dismissive way of expressing what you believe to be true but bear in mind that for the outside world something is true only if it stands on its own merits. The unfortunate thing is that you do not live in a world where everyone else shares your beliefs and even if your beliefs will be proven true a thousand years from now it will bring you no satisfaction. Being human means to understand the people around you and their current needs. Its obviously nice to dream about alternate futures that may or might not happen but we have real people starving that we need to fix today as a real world challenge.

Need I remind you that even though technology started as a tool for liberation it is now used for control and manipulation?  
Tools are amoral they can be used for bad as much they can be used for good. Bitcoin might set us free or enslave us.

I'm not saying this counterfeit money problem does not exist but you have to keep in mind that countries keep each other in check. Its not like any country can inflate its money supply and all other countries that exchange goods with you don't notice.  
Sure you can fool your own citizens but you're not going to fool countries like Russia and China with your money printing. The only country that gets away with it is the USA, for how long remains to be seen.

On a long enough timeline your beliefs are correct but it helps no one living here and now. We're heading to a reboot of civilization even if that happens through transcendence or through self destruction, the end game is the same.

Your argument has some value if we assume the fisherman fishes more than he can eat and that the farmer cares to monetize apples that fall on the ground.
@_date: 2018-09-29 09:57:45
You are selectively making assumptions that make your argument true. There is no denying that there are people making money trading but the belief that we can have a ever growing world where everyone wins is what got us here into the first place.  
Money is a representation of value and value is something that people create and consume.
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:31:51
To be able to explain this to you I would have to know your belief system and given that you've said nothing I know nothing about you but...  
This is not something that trashes traders, if you isolate any profession you can find its benefits and I do believe traders bring benefits to the whole.  
If you look of the bigger picture though, even in situations when all traders win they win at the expense of the user of the traded asset.  
Money is supposed to be a representation of value and value is given by people, those finite. When you trade in a finite system when someone wins someone else loses. To be fair, trading is not even a zero sum game it is a negative sum game because just like in any gambling system the house always wins. This is not to say that people don't make money trading, they make money at the expense of other people because no value is created out of thin air.  
How is life a zero sum game? All your actions have a subject. You cannot be a good person if there is no recipient of your good act. The same is true for all your bad acts. If you live in isolation you're neither good or bad, but since we live in a society and our actions affect others it turns out that all the good things have a recipient and so do the bad things. This means that all the things we do have an effect on others.  
Even if it was that you'd do only bad things, those things would affect people around you and they would treat you accordingly and you in turn would receive only bad things from your peers. There is no situation where you can act like an asshole and people would treat you like an angel. Life is a zero sum game because whatever you do it always comes back to you.

If we talk about the last 50 years I can see how your beliefs resemble any reality but in the grand scheme of things technology is just a blip and has not yet had the time to prove its long lasting effects. Technology could be gone tomorrow but the world will go on without it like it was never a thing.

Inflation speaks only about the currency itself. The bankruptcy of a company leads to the company being closed. You cannot close a government, a country will always have a government representing all its assets.

This is not a problem describing just third world regions a lot people in USA are working two jobs in order to be able to sustain themselves and their families.  
Technology is not a solution to world problems it is just a tool, just like how Bitcoin won't fix world problems it is just another form of money. The sovereignty of the individual is just a side effect of sound money but the individual still needs to take responsibility for his own life.  
A "fair" life can exist only when there is no dishonesty, but as long as there are uneducated people there will always be others to take advantage of them. People from across the history have been trying to solve this problem and they've all come to this same conclusion: "Education".  
Trouble is education is something the individual chooses to do, you cannot force people to learn.
@_date: 2018-09-29 11:18:08
You are right in the literal sense but the context is the existence of the poor and the way I read the comment was "when one wins, someone else loses" which aside particular examples is a fact of life.
@_date: 2018-09-29 11:57:34
Thank you. What do you think Bitcoin is besides money?
@_date: 2018-09-30 18:02:20
That's like people asking how will they be able to watch youtube when the internet was born.

You can transact Bitcoin today. No currency has ever reached a point of equilibrium where X currency always equals two sheep.  
There is no conundrum here, a deflationary currency doesn't encourage reckless spending and that is what we want. Do you really need that fancy car?

You're assuming that people are natively good which is contrary to most religious beliefs. One's life can be satisfactory even if all they did was destroy the world. If everything that matters is following your dreams and you can have dark dreams then nothing matters.
@_date: 2018-09-29 14:59:35
I don't disagree however from the individual's point of view: if the responsibility for your own life is in others then you're powerless, if the responsibility its yours then you have all the power for change.

Money was a natural evolution of things. It is not money that controls people it is their love for money.

If you accept that theres no such thing as a free lunch then for everything that you receive you must pay for in a way or another. If every human pays for everything that he gets the difference between received - paid is zero.  
Salk won fame at the expense of the others (made everybody else less famous).  
Just because we're living in this highly advanced society it does not make us winning at life, the amount of suffering in the world is bigger than ever before as well.  
To put it another way: the reason you have affordable clothes and gadgets in USA is because people are exploited in China. If there was a more profitable way of doing this you can bet capitalists would've find it already.
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:35:08
That's very arrogant of you. You are not seeing the forest, you're seeing a possible forest and there are hundreds or thousands of people like you out of which only one will be "right". You are playing a guessing game on an unpredictable future hoping that after you're dead someone will remember your name.
@_date: 2018-09-30 17:57:15
That is the end goal of Bitcoin, so complaining that Bitcoin that is still in its early stages hasn't reached its final goal is rather pointless.

Play the lottery and hope for the best.
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:53:37
I agree.
@_date: 2018-09-29 09:20:48
True. But just like in trading life is a zero sum game, the more one has the less there is to go around for everybody. There is no solution to this, if everyone was like OP nobody would be around to drive his taxi and serve him food.

Nobody is at fault, I didn't take that to be literal.

I too am familiar with the works of Eckhart Tolle whom I think is right on spot with his description of what is. But he is, like many other great philosophers of all times, living in a dream world. We would all like for everything to be the way we'd like, we just can't find a way to fit all conflicting beliefs in one unified theory.

An inefficient database as the blockchain would be the worst tool to map out world resources. Even if it weren't, you are dreaming of a time where we as humanity will work together but the diversity of the species pretty much tells us that we'll kill each other sooner.

Reality is the physical world and its easy to see how it works, just go outside and talk with people. It is easy to pretend that you know something but it is not a fact till you can test it and prove it with actions.
@_date: 2018-09-29 18:55:22
I get where you're coming from but while true in the spiritual sense this is nonsense in the physical world. We're all part of life but at the same its each one for himself. You either learn to stand up for yourself or you'll get abused by everyone around you.

How else do you see a restaurant working? People don't go to restaurants for food, they go for the whole experience. If it was just about food they could order at home.  
Its not like food is the only thing you need, if all people would have everything they need what do you think will make a doctor stay up at night to threat patients? If nobody under any circumstances could be forced to do stuff they don't enjoy we'd be drowning in shit.

Like any tool the potential for good is as big as the potential for bad. Bitcoin can save us from enslavement or it can be the perfect tool for enslavement.

Not even remotely similar. The rape victims have no say in what happens. The weak people are "freely" choosing their perpetrators. "Freely" as in - even if you are manipulated it is your responsibility for allowing it to happen, you have a brain you can choose to use it or not.

I am not dismissing the utility of dreamers of the future, the world wouldn't exist without them. I am, however, more concerned about what is rather than what will be.

What's even funnier is that about 10 years ago when philosophers were talking about the paperclip maximizer and AIs they said we could invent the AI by accident and before we could realize it it would already be too late. Here we are ten years latter having invented the greed maximizer :)

No thanks! I don't care about any of you. Bitcoin is not a socialist bro club and we're not buddies just because we use it.
