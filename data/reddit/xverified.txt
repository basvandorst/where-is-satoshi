Lol not doing either but just curious.

I have a PC desktop, laptop, Xbox 360 and a Nintendo 3DS, I'm just saying.

Were they all Nexus?

Okay, so for example, when I print out a 'Paper Wallet' it's actually auto-creating a new address for me, and auto-transferring the balance to the 'Paper Wallet' address? Those making the 'My Wallet' account 0 balance?

Just like people that root their Android devices? 
You shouldn't have to remove bloatware and sponserware on the OS.
iOS is clean out of the box.
Android has to be rebooted, rooted, and customized to work for the user.    
The average user knows none of that and deals with security issues and possible loss of identity or financial info.

Wow, that's crazy that it works that way with Chase. I'm not a Chase customer, so this is the first time I've run into something like this.
That's crazy beans that your mom understand and uses BTC. 
I noticed you gave your mother BTC for her birthday. Would you believe me if I told you it's my Birthday today? I'm 24. Just sayin... :l

Or a flashlight app, right?

mpkomara, is a sophisticated man that literally gives perfect examples in regards to Bitcoin. 
  
figuratively 
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:11:32
Okay, thanks, this is the clearest explanation I have ever received. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:53:43
No he's demanding
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:56:17
It randomly works now. Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:54:52
What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:53:51
Because losing $100 is going to put me on the streets. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:38:08
That's an odd link
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:56:56
Understood, I think I'll take the coo BASE jump soon and see what happens. I understand bitcoin is still technically in its infancy and jus want to be a part of it and watch it grow. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:00:22
So be it.    
I'll slowly add more to it, to hold.  
  
I'm not trying to flip a quick buck and make $50. But if I do, awesome.  
  
I'm looking forward to seeing Bitcoin more widely regarded as an actual cross-continent form of transactions.   
  
I'm looking to see a shift as a society, the same way the USPS had to close down offices, because more people are dealing with email.

I have no issue bookmarking Blockchain.info, and Coinbase, and making the bookmarks an App Icon on my home page.   
I mean, I can use Bitcoin no problem from iOS, but I guess it's all about how you wanted it presented to you.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:34:12
Oh, my mistake. I have researched the wrong way. /not sarcasm /seriouslyoops
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:57:23
Neat I'll have to look more in to it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:35:51
But why did you choose Coinbase? 
I don't understand faucets and satoshis, so let me go do some googling.
Will keep reading, thank you.

I do use a QR scanner, and that converts the QR to text, and I just copy the address and paste it. 
Sure, it's 2 extra steps, that I can live with.
Considering the extra security, and peace of mind I deal with for iOS.  
There is just something about Google and Android that rub me the wrong way when it comes to financial security, personal info, and vulnerabilities.   
Plus all this recent Samsung S4 catching fire mumbo-jumbo really should be off-setting more people.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:46:43
Blockchain keeps giving me 'unknown exception' everytime I try to verify any of my info?

I'm not dumping money into it left and right though. Sense I've joined, I've spent $100 total. I can skip Taco Bell, Beer, and 1 video game for a month to afford tossing in $100 to Bitcoin to see what happens, and to have my own story to tell years from now.  
  
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:20:53
PREVIOUS roommate. We no longer live together. But yeah, getting Bitcoin setup for both of us would take just as much time as him paying me with Chase, for this one time.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:26:15
If I'm using a service like 'My Wallet' on Blockchain, and I want to print out to a 'Paper Wallet'. What happens, where? Does the 'My Wallet' address then remove itself, and only available on the printed 'Paper Wallet'?  
If not - Where's the 'security' of a Paper Wallet, if the same address on the 'Paper Wallet' is still available on 'My Wallet' on Blockchain?
Please help me understand what I am missing.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:18:43
No worries man, it's all good
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:21:44
Yes, I figured the VPN was the final issue, I got it working now, but just odd to me that the representative says 'that's not an error code we have in our system'. When I'm clearly reading and looking at it, and can take a screenshot and email it if I have to.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:36:54
I'm in the US. So that shouldn't be a problem.
Localbitboins also seem sketchy to me, as I'd hate to hand some guy $30, for a piece of a paper with some numbers, and he leaves, then I find out the numbers don't work.
Okay, I'll research MultiBit as well.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:57:27
the blockchain.info website has some good stuff.
