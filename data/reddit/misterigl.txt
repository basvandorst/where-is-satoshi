The hacker can't return the coins without going to jail, even at 25%. Think it's more targeted at people who know him and don't bother. They might bother for $3.6 million.
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:48:17
That's true.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:20:34
No, I mean any % other than 100% will get him into jail if he gets caught. If he's sure that he won't get caught, no % matters. But his collaborators/friends/pets might take notice.
Sorry if that was a bit unclear.

It sure looks like it:

How is this a good way to implemented?
RSK is a federated peg AKA centralized and charges high fees. It is a private consortium of companies that are collecting fees and are colluding to provide all the available services for a closed system.
This just seems like the complete opposite of what we want.

I can second that German jurisdiction thing, some of them went insane when it comes to bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:48:54
They are one sided because all small block people feel pretty good in r/bitcoin and get encouraged by only positive posts, so there's no need to change.
The same way kings and their entourage didn't feel very inclined to change away from monarchy.

I usually point people you ask about bitcoin to those videos:
* here is what bitcoin is: 
* how it works: 
* and what it can do: 
And when you have some time/ desire to learn more, this one is a good one, too: 
Those will already give you a little overview, from there just research and ask questions about the topics you want to know more. I and many other people here are happy to help. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:24:39
Good question...
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:37:34
How do you pay with bitcoin over the phone?
Listening to and writing down their public address?
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:00:26
I'm speaking about the network of people/users, like in a social network, a network of business partners or even a network of friends. And such a network creates the network effect, if it has the right incentives.
But I'm fine with using another word, whatever describes it best.
Edit: added the incentives part
@_date: 2014-10-10 23:55:26
All the others are scams, only koinify is the real deal?
Yeah, right...
@_date: 2014-10-18 13:55:01
No, that was the first thing I tried. But it would make sense to not constantly check all old addresses, only once in a while. That would take a lot of resources 
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:01:50
If you send bitcoin to a telegram user without telebit, the coins disappear without notification for the other user.
They are waiting for him until he signs up, still a strange way, though.
@_date: 2015-06-16 04:41:29
Is it that much faster to not process transaction?
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:15:48
Can there be a service to validate and certify that certain open source software is legit and without backdoor? Maybe either the programmer or the consumers would even be willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:13:21
Yes, that would be nice, thanks a lot.
100 bits @_date: 2014-10-16 23:50:58
Source? And why wait?
I want to pay them now!
@_date: 2015-06-26 01:52:29
You should make a lighthouse campaign for 1BTC or so. 
Let it go to a 2-3 multisig address, controlled by you and two other people, then send it to the person who puts up the tested, working pull request.
That way the programmer can be (relatively) sure to get the money once he finished the work. I'd pitch in another 0.05BTC that way...
@_date: 2014-10-07 18:33:50
But if you have a 2-of-4 address, wouldn't you be able to spend bitcoin independently and thus circumvent the green facilitation, i.e. still double spending from an block.io address?
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:56:43
That sounds nice, 1FkVeLq5JEWQtzHAB4SBjqRxX5DLCMANrs

MySpace had a much more valuable history (more users/more content) and they could have implemented all the features Facebook offered when they saw it gaining ground. Why didn't it work out for them?
@_date: 2014-09-14 16:24:16
Imaging following scenario:
A few farmers in Uganda sell their crops for bitcoin every month on the market. After two years they research pump systems and order one from a company in the Netherlands to improve their field watering systems. They use an escrow service, which will get released once the company got the pump to their village somehow.
How would that be possible with a normal phone and the current banking system?
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:35:29
Unfortunately not, but with a SEPA account you have several good options in Europe, like Kraken, localbitcoins, etc
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:16:04
Yeah, blockchain.info, so it could have been on their side, too.

I like your idea, good luck and 100 bits for your sucess. @_date: 2014-05-16 21:13:42
It's the same with cheese, you might not buy the whole cheese (here, all 21M bitcoin), only parts of it, but then you also say you want 300g (1000 bits) instead of 0.3kg (0.001 BTC).

Why is this discussion thread better than posting directly in You have to scroll over all the comments of one topic to get to the next one, which probably will cause some discussions to get lost and you don't see a nice picture for posted links.

Is counterparty bitcoin? Then why different currencies with different exchange rates?
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:03:55
The bitcoin supply is still growing with quite a high rate, even higher than the dollar inflation. You can't know if it still works that well if the creation of new bitcoin stops in 2140...

Yes, ether is an altcoin. 
A different exchange rate means its value is independent of bitcoin's value, means it can thrive while bitcoin crashes to the ground.
Assets aren't altcoins, they are just assigned to/with one, similar as colored coins to bitcoin.

Yes, I think he means monoplization in the western countries. When you look at the US, you have 4 big players and they didn't have much incentive to fight each other until very recently when T-Mobile started.
In Europe the competition is better so the prices are lower there. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 16:02:39
If people uses Ethereum on the bitcoin blockchain via counterparty, then Ethereum's concept and ideas succeed and the money I gave them was well spent (spirit of open source ;-). This development is the best the cryptocurrency world came up with so far and we will all benefit from it, one way or another.
You are probably right, Ethereum will have done bugs and safety issues in the beginning, but that's the same with every new software.
About the numbers: 72,002,454.8 ether will exist in the genesis block and then 18,720,638.2 will be mined every year. (Someone correct me here if I'm wrong)
Having a fixed supply of a coin only makes early adopters rich, but is IMO not very useful or fair later on. Btw, that's how the counterparty developers profit, so they don't only relayed on the true spirit of open source.
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:16:15
Sane here, I tried to convince my friends, even tried to raise funds for them here. But waited for now, as they don't have something for the iPhone. This should speed up the development.

Thank you :)

I looked at the FAQ, but didn't find anyting about creating password protected seed word lists. Adding your answer from above might be a good idea.
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:34:29
When the price is high enough, there will be always possibilities to buy bits, maybe not every single one, but enough.
A lot of really early adopters sold (or spent) after they were sitting on a stack of bitcoin worth many, many times their initial investment, knowing that if anything goes wrong, they might lose it all. They couldn't know that the price would go over $1000/BTC later on. The same might happen again.
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:48:01
Can you use greenaddress on Android somehow with a 2nd authentication?
I found the workaround of setting a limit and then using the Google authenticator on a second phone to raise it, but was wondering if there's a better way.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:26:02
Even the 0.1% is already pretty impressive, as they are only one member of the  bitcoin community and a pretty good role model for other miners imo.
Keep up the good work.

There is Or in Germany, you can use bitcoin.de or kraken.com to buy some.

How are those costs calculated?
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:09:42
Sure, I tried it and it works like this:
After installing Mycelium you create a new wallet (maybe have some activity or even leave some change there, that's the tricking the thief part), then you write down your 12 word list seed. The swiping/wiping part can be done either by uninstalling and then installing mycelium again or with the 'clear data' button in the app settings.
The second time you start a new Mycelium you choose 'restore backup', then 12 words and 'I have a password'. After entering your 12 words and a password you choose, you get a completely new HD wallet, which is only accesible with your word list AND your password, otherwise thieves end up in your fake one from the beginning.
Hope that helped a bit.

I think having a small amount of bitcoin in a hot wallet always with you is fine

Well, what code do you think counterparty used?
It doesn't matter much how the Ethereum ideas work out in the end, on bitcoin or on a separate blockchain, as long as they work out.
That's why I supported the project with some bitcoin. And the more people working on it (Ethereum team, now counterparty, IBM, etc...) the better it is.

Well, we could force billions of people to change their thinking or we few millions could agree on using a smaller unit to make it easier for the rest.
i think I can live with getting used to a new unit.

And for small amounts to test and to have on your phone, Mycelium on Android or Breadwallet on iPhone are pretty easy, too. Just in case you walk by your favorite bar and see them accepting bitcoin ;)

It's one of the best secure messaging apps, end-to-end encryption and completely open-source.
But as the poster said, to convince my friend and family to use it, it would be very nice if TextSecure-ios would be released.
@_date: 2014-12-21 09:08:30

Did the same, actually directly to bits (Mycelium) Suddenly I'm a millionaire, woohoo :-)

I like the idea, think I will order some. Just have to figure out a good, safe way again to make a bunch of keys for the bulk order. And a few questions:
Is it then possible to have something like 3 copies of each wallet, so that I can store them in different locations? Also, can I remove the 'in satoshi we trust' part? And what design/image/message do I get with the bulk order and do they all have to be the same?
Edit: And can I send you the csv file encrypted?
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:21:47
:) You probably would need the algorithm of how they create the picture, but then probably yes.
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:27:28
I'm with you, complaining that wider merchant adoption is bad for the price instead of being happy about more possibilities to spend bitcoin is exactly the reason some people think it's a pump and dump scheme rather than a new, great payment system.
Those might be the people missing to balance out the increasing supply...
@_date: 2014-10-03 03:20:38
Oh yes, think it's fine over https, never mind and I think I can live with the Satoshi sentence.
I'm thinking more like 30 to make use of the 20%, so the bulk order function would come in handy. I think I can figure it our.

Why do you use Google ads only one day before black Friday? People search for that days beforehand and then could tell their friends the next time they meet them.
Also, what about using just black Friday?

Is there a way to secure a wallet on an android phone with 2 factor authentication? One possibility would for example be using a second phone with Google authenticator, but is there a simpler method?
E.g. an nfc chip I have to hold against my phone every time I want to send an transaction?
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:32:19
:) Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:13:37
This is a great idea.
@_date: 2014-10-31 21:16:16
Wow, thanks for the tip and the gold. It's understandable to use their own coding-donation-distribution-system until Lighthouse is ready and maybe coinbase had the easiest/fastest integration at that time.
But yes, I had the same problem on my android, it always reset to the standard of $20. But [BitHub]( worked normally on my desktop browser, there a different value automatically changes the amount of bitcoin and the QR code, so it might be just a little glitch  while rendering.
Whoever wants to fix that can earn $15.36 ;)

@_date: 2014-09-14 16:38:09
Yes, internet is necessary for smart phones, otherwise they nut that helpful, but e.g. Google and Facebook are working on that. But how would they find the Dutch phone number without it?
Also, even better example they are doing some writing jobs for a guy in the US, getting paid in bitcoin instead of selling crops.

But the database is not on the blockchain? How do we make sure nobody is messing with the data in the database?
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:27:45
Probably, haven't tried it yet, though. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:03:58
The software has access to the private key, otherwise it wouldn't be able to decrypt your stuff. And because it's closed source, it could simply send it to the apple server, so that they could decrypt everything they need.
But don't you worry, the key is also still secure in the Secure Enclave...
@_date: 2014-10-31 19:41:03
Imo it's one of the best secure messaging apps, end-to-end encryption and completely open-source.
But as the poster there said, to convince my friend and family to use it, it would be very nice if TextSecure-ios would be released.
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:00:37
Let's say OP could have paid with bits, knowing that in 3h the price would triple:
In almost every city you get bits within some hours via localbitcoins.com of you're willing to pay a big markup. But $240 is still better than $600 and if you have time, it'd be $202.
@_date: 2014-10-13 16:09:30
Sounds good, I'll order one and try it.
Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:29:27
It's not bitcoin based, they will then just clone the finished ethereum code and distribute the coins according to the bitcoin distribution from a point in time they choose.

I'm not in China, just happened to know, so I can't let you know. Sorry.

Okay, didn't know that. Thanks for the explanation. 5000 bits @_date: 2014-11-17 06:18:27
That's where open source comes in, then nobody has to trust the developers, e.g. I'm a big fan of TextSecure
@_date: 2014-10-13 16:08:36
Yeah, that's exactly what I need. But it looks just like an idea as of now.
Any idea about the status?
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:39:15
And I would say that the improvements of some of the other blockchains vs Bitcoin are bigger than the improvements of Facebook vs MySpace or Google vs Yahoo.

If the buyer doesn't mark the payment as complete, your bitcoin will be released after a certain time, usually 6h.
But yes, you can only chat within an offer.
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:42:33
I think he can do that on his own. Link the account to an email address and a bitcoin address, which you watch. Every month you check if the costumer paid for the following month, if not, send an email with simple instructions, maybe a QR code and deactivate the account until the payment shows up.
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:27:16
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:38:56
I think I found the chat, giving away a few bits there, too....
@_date: 2014-12-13 23:16:01
Yes. But try it first, I'm not sure if all wallets handle it the same way.
@_date: 2014-10-25 21:46:11
Yes, that's what I meant.
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:31:54
No, the trades were over bank accounts, just didn't know that I need a license for that, independent of the business registration and declaring taxes.

Why is there a different exchange rate?
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:07:25
There is, click on  the $ or the B⃦ sign to change the input. E.g. if it shows the $ sign and you put in 7. it converts it to 0.012 BTC.

I did about 5 to 10 sepa transfers per day to Euro bank accounts in the same and other counties, each of them free and 1-3 days to clear.
Then my bank asked me to open a business account, now I have to pay a small fee (20 cents) every time, still takes 1-3 days.
So, SEPA is free as long as it doesn't cost too much for the banks which make up the costs by selling you other products or using the money in this waiting days.
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:27:26
But it looks like all critic is seen as troll posts for some people.
And what's all about this censorship, isn't that against bitcoin's fundamental values?
@_date: 2014-12-21 00:46:19
Wouldn't that concentrate it even more?  Because one person can have multiple addresses, but I don't think several people share an address.
Also is there any source for the distribution? An article or so?

Not an altcoin? Then why are there different exchange rates for BTC and XCP?
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:33:25
Some points might be:
*when speaking with people or writing here, use the μBTC price and amounts  
*use a wallet which uses μBTC when showing/dealing with others  
*watch the price on websites in μBTC  
*...  
Media just reports what we bitcoin users are doing, so some articles with μBTC might show up and spread the word

I'm totally with you, 100 bits makes more sense than 0.0001bitcoin, e.g. for a kilowatt hour of energy. 
The kilowatt hour is also a better example than diamonds in this case, as we are using kilowatt hours instead of watt hours for the reasons you stated
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:13:04
Yes, I myself still think they have one of the best costumer services out there, hell, one of them even replied here.
As said, it's just that legit businesses can't do much when the authorities are involved that way.

When you compare the nominal and the real gold price, you realize how bad the inflation actual is. One more reason to hold gold (or bitcoin)
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:50:07
Yeah, that would be fine, but there's nothing like coinbase there?
Another simple way i found would be localbitcoins, but they take quite a big cut.
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:27:03
Oh, nice.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:09:24
The fee explanation would only account for the selling trades, but the main fishy part were the tons of buying trades. And for the liquidity sharing, would there would be evidence of huge bitcoin and fiat transactions between those exchanges.
But yes, I also happy that more information is coming out and used the clear this whole thing up.
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:01:25
That's their official promotion video for the app. I like that those guys don't take themselves too seriously.
@_date: 2014-11-18 04:31:43
It does, but it isn't dependent on it. It can easily switch to another blockchain.
The same way transportation vehicles weren't dependent on horses.
@_date: 2014-10-31 16:01:50
That's what I mean. Let's say I make a sidechain and only I and a couple of friends are using it, then someone wants to buy 10 million worth of those sidechain coins. Where should the liquidity then come from?
Or is it that everyone can exchange between sidechain coins and bitcoin all the time?
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:57:55
Edit: Yes, it could be that the BaFin flagged my bank account

There's a difference between public and private space.
Would you allow other people to speak in parks? Even if the they have a different opinion? Even if they are negative about the current situation all the time and want to change something?
Yeah, that doesn't sounds like good citizens, I think you're right, we should lock them away and ban them from speaking their mind in public...

Haha, yes, I love Vitalik's visions...
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:07:33
Any source for that or did it come out of your wet conspiracy dreams? On the the hand, I have sources to show how they spend it to hire developers for the project.
@_date: 2014-10-13 04:12:00
That actually sounds pretty good, how do you set that up? I didn't find anything related in the settings.

Can you pay directly with bitcoin there? Or do you always have to their card?
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:50:22
You had you give them the receipts of all your transactions with the websites? Isn't that a bit too curious?
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:31:52
The title matches what I think the article should lead us to do. 


And of course it involves bitcoin, read the article before you give any unqualified comments...
@_date: 2014-09-13 02:27:32
I don't think so, I had the standard 0.0001BTC for a one input, one output, one change address transaction. And blockchain.info wouldn't show confirmations in that case.
@_date: 2014-10-27 04:19:00
Actually, despite the sarcasm, I'm one of those. Ethereum has some pretty nice ideas and if they work out or not, the cryptocurrency system can only benefit from their development, that's why I support the project.
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:11:24
It doesn't work for all addresses :(

I'm not sure if I'm 100% correct, but I think that's not how sidechains work. I believe they get created by turning bitcoin into whatever coin is on that sidechain or then reverse back into the mainchain.
If you turn 200,000,000 satoshis into 200,000,000 sidechain coins, don't you have only ~$700 liquidity in that chain?
Maybe someone more knowledgeable can confirm/correct that.

I think the bot is sleeping at the moment
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:49:42
Can you still turn BTC into XCP?
What prevents counterparty from abandon the currency Bitcoin, maybe just still use it's blockchain, but simply run completely with XCP?
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:50:43
from &gt;the X signifying that it isn't tied to a government, and the BT standing for Bitcoin. (much like gold==XAU, silver==XAG, etc.)
@_date: 2014-11-02 20:30:42

@_date: 2014-06-07 14:06:06
A friend of mine is similar, technically proficient and generally open minded, but also concerned that technology is doing hardly anything to help people. He's said he's not speaking about some yuppy niche problem like ordering their food faster, but real world problems like hunger, poverty, water scarcity, homelessness, human right violations or others. Until now he doesn't see the benefit of bitcoin...
I know bitcoin is not a wonder-instant-cure-all thing, but it might be a step into the right direction, so I want to sent him a list with links to show that. I thought I start with the two bitcoinfilm films, any more sugestions? 
@_date: 2014-12-21 09:02:06
I can maybe see darkcoin or ethereum offer some advantages, but dodge and lite? I don't think so...
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:05:29
It won't be wasted either way. 
True, some money went to legal and other stuff, but most went towards the development. So IMO the bitcoin were still well spent.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:26:39
Also, for the spending wallet, protect your backup with a password, in case someone finds it. Today I learnt and posted a good way to do that with Mycelium. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:49:29
I don't think that's true for authentication apps on phones. They are just a program running a time based algorithm from a specific seed you get from your account, but that's only one way, it doesn't work to trace it back to your account.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:29:45
Or [onewallet.io]( they only take 2%
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:35:52
Sorry for your loss. Next time use a multi-sig escrow service like hashtrust.com
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:20:54
As far as I see it, Ether might be more evenly distributed, as much more people know about it and can still buy as many as they want. And the possibility to mine with normal PCs helps, too, where also less computer power is 'wasted' (except the higher security against 51% attacks maybe)
That might still lead to circlejerk, but at least the circle is bigger and more open then. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 05:04:17
Greenaddress does it, but then it's 27 words, which is not compatible with mycelium
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:34:38
Dodge and litecoin? Do they have anything useful to offer?
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:15:36
Are the messages encrypted?
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:34:43


Well, then we make it one. Someone also said, bitcoin is not a currency and look where we are now.
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:20:53
They don't have bitcoins yet, the astropay would have been for bitstamp to deposit money.

@_date: 2014-11-21 02:44:04
That's where the escrow comes in. If the ad suggest that's it the actual product and only a little line says: "it's just the box, sucker" most third persons will vote for the buyer.

There are rumours that the government hired thugs to breast the protesters and rip apart the tents in the occupy area, while the police was watching but ignoring it.
I sent some money to your official Occupy Hong Kong Bitcoin address 123mbDdfn6fo1aNhowFTDFahqvx6DU9KiC and hope it already helps a little bit. There could be more when I see some Dim Sum delivered to the frontline.
@_date: 2014-10-25 21:05:19
That's why you should encrypted it and store it multiple times in different locations.

Hashtrust.com looks pretty good.
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:08:48
Well, the translation didn't work out that well, you can find the [original here]( but basically it says:
Miles Kimbach asks a bunch of central banks to make the use of cash more expansive in order to avoid people keeping their fortune in cash after banks introduced a negative interest rate. He suggests having only electronic money as the legal tender, but not cash, so that there can be an exchange rate between those two, There should be an English article, too, as he is a professor at the University of Michigan.
I just thought, Dude, Bitcoin will screw up their whole plan.
@_date: 2015-05-18 08:33:11
That's a great idea and lighthouse would probably work very well for that
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:08:53
Is there an Android wallet that measures the network propagation?
@_date: 2014-11-18 15:35:59
Exactly. I don't see 100% of the population behind that change, but everyone will be better off by it. Well, expert the 1%.
Also, I don't think it's a fight between generations, e.g. a lot of union workers have partly corresponding goals, they just don't know how to use the internet.
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:28:24
Maybe a sidechain could come in handy, where those billions of transactions occur, back and forth, up and down, but once in a while everything gets settled on the mainchain...

Yes, that's something else I was wondering, how exactly does counterparty raise the utility value of bitcoin?
I mean, they are using XCP as internal tokens and just piggyback on the Bitcoin blockchain because it's the strongest one. But if the bitcoin value crashes to the ground and the Bitcoin blockchain strength with it, they could simply switch to a stronger one.
Would be fine for me, currently I'm all about bitcoin, but as long as one open-source, decentralized cryptocurrency succeeds, we can make this world a better place ;-) 
I'm just wondering if counterparty is actually good for bitcoin or more a leecher...
Edit: Maybe leecher is the wrong word, sorry, wanted to say more like: good for bitcoin or doesn't care much about it...
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:01:39
You mean like saving it as an encrypted textfile?
Hmm, yes, that's a possibility, but then I'm out of luck if my computer is compromised. I would prefer having a list of words written on paper and then need a password to use it.
Does anyone knows a Mycelium reddit account I could page here and ask for help?
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:22:58
Even easier in the Eurozone, he already figured out Kraken, send them money (free, within two days), buy bitcoin, be happy.
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:26:13
So, not to be too paranoid here, but three things:
Malicious tor exit nodes can comprise your downloads and anyone finding or you loosing that paper means all your bitcoin are gone.
For cold storage I would suggest, boot from a fresh linux usb, get the bitaddress.org or bippy.org files and then disconnect from the internet, you could md5sum check if they are compromised. Then generate bip38 encrypted wallets (long, but memorable password) and print some coppies, then erase everything.
Keep those in a few different places (friend, patents, bank, etc), so even if someone finds those copies or you loose one, your bitcoin are still safe.
And it's fine to have a small amount on your smartphone wallet for everyday spending.

@_date: 2014-11-18 15:30:45
That's true. Competition brought us must of the develoment and I think the flamewars are more done by the fans than by the actual developers.

My reddit account is linked to my real identity quite a bit, that's why I'm not writing anything compromising here.
But to your question, there was no effort to stay anonymous at all, my official name and bank account, paying taxes as far as it was clear by then, etc..., just didn't know that I need a licence for that.

Well, what about the possibility to switch to another one if the current one gets fucked up too badly?

@_date: 2017-02-18 15:44:28
I'm not sure if you're deliberately ignoring the developments in E or if r/bitcoin successfully shielded you from it...
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:20:31
Yes, I'm wondering about that, too. If it's really end-to-end encryption, what is Facebook gonna do?
Also, will whatsapp then be able to communicate with open-source openwhispersystems apps like TextSecure and whisperpush on cyanogen mod or is it whatsapp internal only? I'm waiting on an announcement from openwhispersystems itself.

A while ago [I posted here]( how to make different HD wallets from the same seed word list. If you have a bunch of bitcoins and are afraid that you get blackmailed for your password, create one HD wallet with a password and put e.g. 10 bitcoin on it and a second HD wallet with a different password where you put the rest. When now you get called with your parents in danger, you give them the first password.
You'll lose those 10 bitcoin, but your parents and your bigger stash are fine, hopefully. 
Edit: just saw someone posted a similar idea with the trezor seed. But if you put in only a few cents, the blackmailers will be like: okay, nice, and now what's the real password?
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:31:14
It depends where you are. Circle or coinbase in the US, kraken or bitstamp in Europe, bitfinex also works in a lot of parts of the world.
And you can anyways always try localbitcoins.com

Any source for that? IMO you're talking complete BS out of fear that something better devalues your bitcoin investment. I'm totally into bitcoin myself, I just like the Ethereum ideas, which will either work out themselves or be integrated into bitcoin somehow. Either way, I think it's totally worth it to support that development, even if you don't see a good return of your investment.
They have bi-weekly updates about their progress, are completely transparent what they do with the money and their plans for the next steps towards the launch (which might have to be delayed a bit, I have to admit that)
Source: blog.ethereum.org
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:37:53
Yes, that is a problem
Edit:after thinking about, that's not possible, I have some bitcoin, but certainly am not part of the .2%, so they can't own all the bitcoin. But it is true, that bitcoin is far worse distributed than the real economy, that's why I like how how ether is distributed.

Just leave all the kilo, milli, etc stuff behind, just:

That's how markets work. In the beginning there are always high prices, it's called first to market. Then other people want a piece of the pie and offer better prices. At one point there will be an equilibrium with low rates.
If it would really be so an outrageously greedy rate, why don't you simply put one up, undercut the first BTM and take the enormous profits? That would help spreading bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:57:13
The case itself has ended, but I have still a lot of money locked up, so I don't want to give any details until this is figured out.
I'll write a post then here in r/bitcoin, sorry for leaving you hanging for now.
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:41:57
Yes. For example, is there an alternative to localbitcoins.com? It's forbidden in Germany...
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:08:08
Yes, I know it's not your fault, it's Fidors. But they are not very helpful, my last emails were mid December and last week, no answer to either of them :-(
And unfortunately exchanges depend on banks like that...
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:25:21
Well, you could say exactly the same about bitcoin vs dollar, and that's even a bigger step.
But in general, I don't think bitcoin and ethereum are directly competing with each other.

Why would we from Europe use an US based exchange?

In the Proof of Concept version, yes, same stage as IBM's system. You actually can already mine testnet ether. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 10:27:16
Ethereum. It either will be very useful on its own or its code could be integrated into bitcoin or its sidechains. Either way, I thought the Ethereum ideas are very worth it to get developed, so I supported them with a few bits.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:48:01
I can't wait :)
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:43:19
Yes, they mostly use a technique where they make a story out of the numbers, but with bitcoin addresses you also have lower case and capital letters, that might get much harder.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:17:04
That's not the question. The question is, what happens if the bill is 0.5 BTC but you send 0.6 BTC?

Ethereum? Never heard of it.
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:36:43
I have a about payment processors like BitPay or coinbase. When you send them a bit more, do they keep it or do they transfer the bigger sum as dollars to the merchant?

Check out the talk Andreas gave in front of the Canadian Senate, they asked some useful questions, which were answered quite well. Those questions and answers helped the senators to understand bitcoin much better, so you should use some of them.

Not blocked, but when you get to the side from a German IP, it says something like: not allowed due to regulatory issues.
You could use a vpn to get around that, but then they could get you when you use your bank account. And I think there aren't local trade ads either.

You can do the same with bitreserve, no need to invent a new coin.

I'm not saying that people shouldn't get rewarded for their work.
e.g. what about crowdfunding the development of a software, developer gets the $200,000, contributers get the software, as well as everybody else.

They should get their shit together, I'd be happy to use textSecure, as it is the better system, but if half of my friends can't use it, there is no point, so I had to convince them to use Telegram. And when openwhispersystems finally brings out an ios version, it might be too late, as people don't want to switch again :-\
They got $400,000 7 months ago to develop an ios version, every decent programmer can port the Android code to ios in much less time. But instead they they work on bringing their code to closed source whatsapp, which just keeps people in false safety, and organize a 'winter of code'. Which has to be in Hawaii, of course. Really, fuck those guys.
Edit: reading my texts makes me look pretty butthurt. What I am, I really had big hopes in openwhispersystems, but they let me down :-(
Edit 2: I even made a post here in to ask people to donate to them to help them develop the ios version. That was before I got to know that they are just chilling on a bunch of money already.
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:45:34

Don't worry, everyone had to start at knowing nothing, so it's good to ask questions.
Breadwallet is using bits, which is just a different denomination, like dollar vs cents. 1BTC is 1 million bits, so e.g. $5 currently are 0.025107 BTC or 25107 bits. Many services/people prefer and will eventually switch to bits, as large numbers are easier to handle than tiny fractions and the Bitcoin Foundation is working on standardizing that.
Second, how to get bitcoin? It mainly depends on the country you're in, which one is it? Then I can help you more. An almost global (stupid Germany), but more expensive way is localbitcoins.com, there you either find people to meet personally or different methods to get bitcoin from private persons over the internet.
Hope that already helped a bit.

But the client is open source and the messages are encrypted directly on your phone, so there's not much they can do. It's like saying using PGP is unsafe because the email provider is not open source. I don't know much about gems, but I think the ads are opt-in, if you want to get paid coins, so it's not the network profiting, but you.
That being said, I'm still way more excited about TextSecure, everything there is open source end-to-end encryption by default and for groups (not only a secret chat like in telegram). I hope they bring out their iOS and other versions soon, instead of just surfing and munching on sushi all the time.

Especially because bitcoin is such a heavy weight, it might be difficult to introduce radical improvements, as there might be big bitcoin stakeholders not benefiting from it.
Let's say a way better PoW algorithm will be discovered in a year and people leave bitcoin for an altcoin using it. I think the miners would still refuse to switch and rather mine on a sinking value, because switching would make their ASIC farms unusable immediately.
And there might be other structural problems with bitcoin, which maybe still translate into the sidechains, too, as they are pegged to it.
I think it's quite important to have strong competition among the cryptocurrencies for now, as it keeps the different developers/stakeholders on their toes and allows trying out a lot of cool ideas. If they then end up in bitcoin or in a successful altcoin, is not that important, we just need a great blockchain technology to change the world.

Use coinbase.com. Once you're set up you can buy bitcoin at will at the current price and receive them a few days later.
After getting verified and hooking up your credit card, you can also receive them instantly for amounts up to $1000 or so...

Encryption doesn't have to perfect, as there is no perfect one anyway. If someone really wants your messages, they just beat you up until you give them the keys.

Threema is closed source. Switzerland might turn a blind eye on money laundering and other stuff, but what do you think how quickly they jump once their banks feel threatened, let's buy a new form of money which undermines their business model?
Edit: Telegram is based in Berlin. And especially because the founders are from Russia, they know how important it is, that the government can't read your messages. When you ask people in Germany, you often hear: I don't care if the government is spying on me, I'm not doing anything wrong...

I think keeping bitcoin in exchanges is not the best idea (lost bitcoin in mt. gox and have funds locked up in kraken), so paper wallets are better in my opinion. To be safe, make several copies of (password encrypted) paper wallets and store them in different places.
Another option is a hardware wallet like the trezor or the HW-1

In a linked list you can simply take out / change an element without rewriting the whole thing.
Here you'd have to rewrite every following block in that chain, hence it's a blockchain, even if it's permissioned

What about encrypting your phone?
@_date: 2016-12-17 14:25:28
No, you only change the previous node, pointing to the node you want to delete and let it point to the following one. Done.
With hashes it becomes more difficult but still possible if you're the only one managing the list.
Once you need to reach consensus with other parties in the network you cannot simply change it anymore.
So that's my definition of a blockchain: a list of linked hashes, where changing one element results in having to change the whole remaining list, and that you have to reach consensus about the truth within the network, via PoW, PoS or another mechanism like permission or something else.
@_date: 2016-11-19 15:08:51

How many bank settlements are there every day? How many transactions can the network handle? I think the first number outpases the second if we don't increase the blocksize. Banks probably would be fine to pay a $50 transaction fee for a million dollar settlement, as it saves them a bunch of money.
Everyone paying less in transaction fees won't make it into a block. But yes, you're right, anyone will still be free to use bitcoin, just that the transaction fee may be higher than at present...

Of course does censorship change your support. You most likely got your opinion by reading about the topic instead of just waking up one morning and realizing that one is better than the other.

This is actually the second mass exodus in Bitcoin, the first one was in 2015 to Ethereum.
Same reason, a centralized authority (core is this case) is fucking things up again, so everyone who actually wants to use Bitcoin or wants to build on it, is leaving again.

Actually, it adds accountability, everybody can watch how much donations they get. Remember, you can have bitcoin as open or as private as you want.
Also, a static address makes a lighthouse campaign much easier and comprehensible

They will sell their bitcoin for cash with a discount, because there's not that much cash available. That will incentives people from neighbouring countries to bring in cash somehow to get the cheap coins...

Edit: This and airbitz
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:54:09
Yes, as it is open source, so everyone can change any parts in any way they want.
So yes, big banks, government and corporations won't allow a permission-less, anonymous and open blockchain for everyone, because "terrorists"; "childporn", "people are not smart enough to decide on their own", and so on, you name it. They will build walled gardens (read [here]( how IBM sees the role of Hyperledger) the same way AOL built wallet gardens in the 90s.
While we all now what happened the AOL's walled garden in the long term, they provided a solid on-ramp to the open internet for many people. That's why we (I'm part of the mentioned Ethereum community of enthusiasts and programmers who like decentralization) help them to build a lot of amazing stuff, too.
The more blockchain applications they are, they better for everyone. There will be ways the different blockchains will interact with each other, even with the permissioned ones. But the open, permission-less ones like Bitcoin (for money, I still have many bitcoins, too) and Ethereum (for programming) will always be there, because they can't get shut down, and allow everyone to send and program anything they want forever. So the some way people broke out of the AOL walled garden once they saw the real internet, they will break out of the consortium chain garden once they are comfortable with blockchains.
People don't want to be locked it and the big banks will bite the dust.

@_date: 2015-07-10 03:01:59
I'm pretty sure more people can afford a big enough hard drive in 10 years than a server farm which can handle the enormous amount of transactions per second.
Also, it's easier to out of the centralized by hard drive space network, as every tiny organisation with 10 people can afford disk space big enough. But once e.g. everyone in the US uses the PayPal hub, there's no way out, except paying a $5 fee for your $4 coffee.

Good article, I'm very excited about Rootstock. Two things:
* Why are they using a corporation consortium to peg their token? If they have to convince miners to switch anyway, why not a real 2 way peg like the dogecoin devs are working on? That way you could keep using decentralized bitcoin with Ethereum smartcontracts instead of a trusting a consortium.
* Great idea to make it compatible with Ethereum smart contracts, that way developers can already start building cool things, use all the Ethereum development resources and experience and then switch once Rootstock goes live.

How often do you send money back and forth between your local coffee shop, friends, grocery, restaurant, online shop, swimming pool, landlord, movie theater, school, car dealer, airline, retirement fund,...?
You either have a separate payment channel open with all of them, which they have to close before they can use the money, which would mean a bunch of on chain transactions per month.
Or everybody uses the same payment hub, e.g. the PayPal payment hub, which gives PayPal similar controll over your money as they have now.

@_date: 2016-02-25 07:45:06
Yes, you're right. By convincing the miners to switch in meant convincing them to run a client with code to hardfork the blockchain to support that. Sorry if that wasn't clear.

Yes, the lighthouse campaigns would only cover the first part, raising funds from the community. And maybe also showing what it prioritizes.
But then there's the other part, the way to allocate / spend the funds. That has to be solved differently.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:50:40
Do you see a good way to use Lighthouse to fund the Bitcoin development? Maybe just partly, together with company contributions, maybe with some upgrades and additional services outside of it?
I think Lighthouse is an amazing project with big potential, it's just not used coordinated enough yet.
@_date: 2015-04-17 18:47:31
You can make your own via lighthouse. Let me know if need any help / tips, I'm happy to help.
You can find an example [here](
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:30:50
Yes, eventually. For the minimum pledge size we already use bits, you see it when you click on the QRcode.
For the main project goals we will use whatever lighthouse uses to not confuse people for now.
@_date: 2015-04-15 14:41:35
Did you pledge over the lighthouse client? Then there should be revoke button, which is available until the project in completely funded. Or if you still have the lighthouse.wallet file, you can directly sweep the private keys and revoke it that way.
Also, another way to pledge is over [lightlist.io]( where you can pledge directly from your browser, but still in full control of your coins.
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:36:34
Actually, maybe not. If it was an exchange, they still have access to those coins and might take them after 5 years. 
Or after reading this post ;-)

It's a difference if you're working for an open source project or for for-profit company like Elon Musk's or Mycelium and open bazaar  Is asking for donations, too. Even bitcoin has paid developers now.

It's great to see that you answer concerns of the community so elaborately, thanks a lot for that.
At one point answering the same questions over and over again becomes just a waste of time. As you already mentioned in another comment, keep a list with links to those answers and use it. You (and we) can use your time in a better way.
I'm happy that blockstream supports the bitcoin development, the more resources that go into it, the better. But I also think it shouldn't be the only /main source, maybe we (the community) can come up with something to use lighthouse campaigns to get some additional funding into the bitcoin development.
You're doing a great job, keep up the good work.

Yes, the ChangeTip Integration was another part of our hackathon contribution and you're right, in this case there would be another party involved, or three to be exact. 
We would collect tips to our Reddit/Twitter/etc account via ChangeTip and withdraw them once they reach the minimum lighthouse pledge amount. They automatically go to a multisig BTC address which will only get cosigned by BitGo if it goes to the corresponding lighthouse project target address.
Same as with the ShapeShift integration, we're finishing up the code before we integrate it into our live website.

You realize that with the internet mob it mean Bitcoin user, don't you?
The many people who actually (want to) use Bitcoin, not the developers or investors...
@_date: 2015-04-20 19:30:20
No, there is no third party involved. When you click on the QR code, you'll find more information and BashCo already described it quite well. In general it works like this:
* every time you visit a project page, your browser generates a unique private key, shows the corresponding QRcode and listens in on the blockchain
* When you send bitcoin to this address, a partial bitcoin transaction for that lighthouse project is signed in your browser with that private key
* Those bitcoin wait in the address (to which only you have the private key) until the lighthouse project is fully funded and claimed or you revoke them with the provided revoke link

Thanks for your contribution to the bitcoin development, every single one is important and I'm glad you're doing this. I just think in general there is a better way of doing this.
**For the crowdfunding part:**
* Instead of Mobbr we can use Lighthouse, that cuts out the middleman with their fees and possible rules on what can be funded and what not. It has real transparency built in, as everything runs on the Bitcoin blockchain. And people can revoke their pledges if they see that a particular project/task is going nowhere.
* While Lighthouse is still in beta, it already works well, as we see for example with the [Darkwallet funding rounds]( On the other hand, the top comment on your [previous post]( states that Mobbr is not working flawlessly.
* It is made and maintained by Mike Hearn, so at least one Bitcoin Core developer is happy with it and already [suggested several campaigns]( to crowdfund the development.
* Olivier Janssens chose Lighthouse as one part to replace the Bitcoin Foundation and is ready to [support Bitcoin development]( with it. You might or might not agree with his goals or the way he communicates, but I think it is a great way to support Bitcoin and its development. As said in the beginning, every contribution counts.
**For the distribution part:**
* This part is trickier, but I think paying developers simply by contributed amount of code is the wrong way to go. I can imagine many developers being happy with just receiving a monthly pay check and concentrate on the code instead of worrying about marketing and / or padding their code contributions and where the money comes form.
* I think we still need some kind of entity for the distribution of the funds, taking those burdens off of the developers shoulders, until we find a decentralized way that really works.
* The developers can still work independently, but if they work too differently from a priority list (from the entity and based on the crowd sourced campaigns) without a good reason (like a serious bug in the protocol), people would stop donating money to that campaigns.
Hopefully we can find a good way to continue to fund the developers.

* Western Union is the only possibility

Because it's not true. Theymos just called it that to justify the deletion of all posts about XT.
If a hard fork (meaning that new blocks won't be compatible with older clients anymore, I.e. Because XT allows bigger blocks and current clients don't) would turn bitcoin into an altcoin, then we already have an altcoin, because we had several bitcoin hard forks.
There's also the sub which is not unbiased either, but at least there's no censoring and you get another view of the debate.

There could be several lighthouse campaigns for different features / bug fixes / changes, like Mike Hearn suggested on [his page]( or similar what [Hive is doing]( 
People could vote with their donations and give the developers an idea what the community wants most. The Developers would still work independent, but could arrange their priorities according to funded lighthouse campaigns.
Say, a feature campaign got funded, but the developers decide to do a bug fix or another feature first, they would have to explain why this particular part was more important at the moment. If it was reasonable, the community would understand and be happy, otherwise we would stop donating money.
Additionally, there could be a general donation fund for times with less buzz.

Is that correct? Then it would work here and in lighthouse, as you want to give money/donate, but can't do it yet.
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:13:16
I want one, too. :)
@_date: 2015-03-06 04:51:56
Yes? I use NoScript and on almost all side some Google domain pops up... :/

Wonderful, thanks.

Can we use [lighthouse]( to advance Bitcoin development a bit?
We could incentivize certain features / bug fixes / peer reviews per crowd funding (z.b [Mike Hearn's proposals]( and others) and [Olivier Janssens pledged]( to complete the best Bitcoin development projects with $50.000.
Let's get this thing off the ground already! 
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:31:18
I don't think the slightly faster confirmations have any effect on the supply.
Let's say the manage somehow to double the hash rate, that would be 50.000 extra to the stack of 13.something mid million
@_date: 2015-10-01 08:45:51
You forgot censoring...
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:21:38
Someone has to start. If all merchants would have said that credit card terminals are too complicated, they never would have been implemented.
A bitcoin PoS is not more complicated.
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:48:51
Yes, Mycelium on smartphones and electrum on PCs allow you to use your own 12 words.
But really choose them randomly, there people constantly scanning for weak seed word lists...
Also, I know at least from mycelium, you additionally can useuse a password to protect it, making it a completely new HD wallet, in case someone finds your word list.
@_date: 2015-03-16 01:46:11
Yes, more a JS based one, everything happens in your browser.
We are working on something like that, would you like to help us and beta test it?
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:18:56
They also have a [lighthouse campaign]( to further develop their goals.

What's the advantage of having a media badge? Do you get in for free or have special access to something?
@_date: 2015-10-29 07:26:39
On the Bitcoin testnet?
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:29:44
Oh, yes, true. Companies never want any customer data, as it could cause damage to them in case they get hacked.
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:58:52
Exactly, and they can still use and implement stuff they learned/codes in the first project
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:09:31
I don't think it's a special Bitcoin transaction, you're sending your bitcoin to a group of people, which they hold, while issuing you a RSK token for the RSK network. Once you send them back the RSK token the destroy it and send you back your bitcoin.
Is that correct?
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:20:39
Would a website interface to access the network work?
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:44:25
Nice. Will check it out once I get to a computer.
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:15:48
Yes, same thing, the lighthouse project goes to that address.
A smaller funding step towards the big 131BTC funding goal and [live updates]( might just be a bit more motivating. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 16:18:16
I didn't have have to wait, the funds were in my account seconds after I sent it.
What bitcoin wallet / service did you use?
@_date: 2015-10-01 07:31:26
IMO their actions might be bad for bitcoin core, but they are good for bitcoin. But some of the blockstream developers' actions are toxic for bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-03-06 13:33:23
Having the same name would be nice. It's annoying to tell people the name of the app and then, oh no, actually it's something completely different.
But I meant, what's up with a company owning the route to delivering software?
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:44:44
Yes, that's an awesome project, too.
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:10:49
Use whatever is more convenient / cheaper for you. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 23:25:39
When you use bank transfer, check the exchange rate. CitiBank claimed they only take $30 but didn't say anything about their 3% lower exchange rate.
Fucking banks, but that's how I got into bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:53:26
Money was not supposed to be digital, until someone just did it. Sometimes it's time to move forward a bit...
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:40:13
They also have a lighthouse crowdfunding campaign:
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:47:31
I came here to see what r/bitcoin says about ripple
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:54:26
Tried it, it's awesome! 
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:45:35
keeping the 1MB blocksize cap creates more centralization than removing it, as fewer and fewer people will be able to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:33:05
What people opposing a larger blockchain don't get is that otherwise transaction will get so expensive and rate that only a few selected one can use them. 
Sure, you can go on and keep it the way it is, but then you have a fully decentralized network run by many people, but only used by banks to settle their transaction. Bravo good job!
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:28:22
Is the sharp decline in the end due to data not available yet or is there really less volume?
@_date: 2015-03-15 15:19:50
That's true and I think the second (people) comes more easily with the first (development environment and basic project layout). 
Money might not be the problem, but maybe the core devs have different priorities at the moment. Could someone else do it? Even if it's harder from the outside?
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:12:43
If you want to use an online wallet greenaddress.it is not bad
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:12:06
Well, the side is bitcoin. Bsnkers are not a homogeneous mass, they can have different opinions
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:55:22
I see that similar, they can't take a general part of the bitcoin system as their company name and then complain that other people use that name, too.
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:29:54
Yes, the same way someone has access to your credit card( cvv and address), your bank account( username and password) and your social security number at the same time, by guessing all of them. Even less likely with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:52:23
The UK has a Darwin note? Awesome!

I like the new directions the foundation is heading. Core development and education
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:21:24
What do you mean? 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:03:49
Is that confirmed somehow / somewhere else? It looks pretty fake. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:44:04
The part of your Euros you're not using is like a commodity. It's almost certain that they will be less valuable in 10 years than they are now due to inflation, but there's a good chance that bitcoin will be more valuable in 10 years.
That's also the reason people buy gold
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:36:07
Sounds good.
@_date: 2015-03-23 03:49:07
I think Vinumeris only has Mike Hearn's projects, but lighthouse can be used by everyone to crowdfund their ideas.
[lightlist.io]( is a gallery where everyone can upload their projects and people can browse through them easier than finding them from different sources. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:29:16
Actually, my co-op I'm living in it's looking for a voting system?
I'd love it, if we could use the blockchain, is there something (almost) ready to use? Doesn't have to be fancy...
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:07:42
Yes, a lot of of projects have to come out of crowd funding, otherwise it just might end up as a centralized for-profit company.
Also, it should be encouraged to open-source all parts of a successful project, not only give the first batch to the crowdfunders and then sell the rest proprietarily.
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:22:06
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:23:34


Ever crossed your mind that people with deep pockets (e.g. Bill Gates) maybe have a different agenda than the masses without deep pockets? 
Sure, you can sit back and let those guys decide everything for you, or you can do something yourself (with a bunch a other people without deep pockets on their own)
I gave Ethereum some money, but not to get rich (their protocol is not setup to limit supply artificially and make holders rich), but because their ideas are amazing and worth supporting. If they get put into action, either directly or incorporated into Bitcoin, everyone wins. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:13:56
I'm on BART to check it out later today.
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:19:16
Even if they just allow it to be used to top up their account would already help.
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:18:58
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:07:43
No, it doesn't make sense. You don't need broadband to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:58:57
In the end. 20 years ago 1mb every ten minutes to thousands of other computers sounded pretty far fetched, too.
And the cap doesn't mean that all blocks are that large, only if it's needed. And if it's needed then it's good that we have such a large cap.
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:47:50
Actually, all of them have their own currencies (Storjcoin X, XCP, Maidsafecoin (later Safecoin)), so what differentiates those projects from all the other ones which add value compared to bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:22:10
Yes, in a way, one wallet one vote, and not the bigger the wallet, the more votes you get.
And I'm surly not supporting a gatescoin...
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:00:20
Well, you're right.
You download Mycelium and receive bitcoin. Then you can send them to someone else. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:18:19
Bitcoin is the best kind of mobile banking!
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:35:41
How do you get fiat money in?
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:23:00
That sounds awesome. And it's open source! Will try it now.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:22:46
I think mycelium and some other wallets are working on integrating coinapult's locks, would that help?
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:44:10
I think it's good if people spend money when they need to or want to, but not if they are forced to.
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:04:24
Yes, for a lot of projects it won't be easy to verify. Especially if the beneficiary doesn't have a established brand / website, e.g. a farmer in Uganda raising money for seeds
Mike is thinking about this in the lighthouse discussion email list, too: 
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:39:33
Less risk means also less rewards, so we probably won't see a bubble from 200 to 120000 anytime soon. Or ever.
As long as it keeps some value and is usable, I'm happy. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:43:14
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:11:50


It didn't get funded :-(
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:46:39
Blockchain voting would be anonymous, exactly to avoid people being accountable. [Here] you can see what happens if they are accountable.
It indeed worked out for him, but not for the people he's trying to help. Bill Gates is not the first rich person who tried to help poor people in a 'rich-person-top-down-way'. It usually doesn't work out that well.
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:23:13
That might be true for the us, but I'm sure the rest of the works is not that keen on giving an American company power over its money transactions.
But I see your point, compared to the ACH system even ripple is way ahead
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:24:12
True, sorry about that, won't happen again.
Thanks for checking the projects. We now also upped our game checking the projects for legitimacy.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:27:34

Or, you know, maybe people just like your post and upvoted it.
I upvoted it and I'm pretty sure I'm not a bot or get paid for it.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:20:24
That sounds fun, I'm on board. 1000bits No, but seriuos, with your experience now, are you invested in bitcoin only or in some other projects, too?
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:04:24
Nice, thanks for the calculations. 4000 bits @_date: 2015-02-13 18:06:37
Which one?
