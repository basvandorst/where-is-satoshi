It's a 3rd party ledger that allows you to transact within it and then settles to the blockchain when you're ready to cash out and no longer stay within that 3rd party ledger.   It sends 1 big transaction of 100BTC instead of 100 small transactions of 1BTC, but still allows people to transact in BTC, but without creating a blockchain transaction for each movement of the currency.. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:25
Exactly, and that's the problem. It forces you to abandon the trustless nature of Bitcoin and put your trust in the person/corporation operating that lightning channel, while paying the fees to that operator instead of the network and it's miners. This turns the Bitcoin network into a settlement layer, like the ACH network banks use, instead of treating it like a currency itself.  It's completely unnecessary if you just increase blocksize and utilize [Thin Blocks]( (still in the works, I believe)

They initiate the ACH transfer today, at today's price. The money gets withdrawn from that account in 3-5 days, and your coins get delivered that same day.  That's for all non-instant transactions. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:34:29
No, that's exactly what will end up happening if the transaction completes successfully, I'll resell the coins back to coinbase and hopefully not lose too much on the market change/spread. It's just a pain in the ass to have to wait 5 days and then pay a $35 overdraft fee.

It wouldn't "pop up". There'd be no incentive to make it public, when you could simply start at the top with the largest known public address, and sweep the coins from each adress until you had all the coins. Then, I guess, maybe you'd make it public.

Green is the number of open offers to buy coins at the price on the X axis. So there's about 20BTC in buy offers (bid price) at the $10,001 price and then about 110BTC in buy offers at the $10,000 price, along with about 160BTC at the $9,960 asking price.

That's to get rid of Coinbase's purchasing fees, not BTC blockchain transfer fees that go to miners.

You won't be "buying" them.  
When the chain splits, your coins will exist on both chains.   
Both of which can be sold for whatever value the new coins are worth, possibly being worth double if both chain's coins maintain their original pre-split value.

Your original post didn't mention incentives.  
Where would you be getting those profits from? Wouldn't the block rewards be given to the miners who find the block, the same way other pools work? Or are you going to take a percentage, to be given back at a later time? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:24:04
The main flaw I see is that the only way a "reddit" mining "cooperative" would get more profit than a traditional mining pool would be to take a larger cut of the block rewards, to then later be given back to users.. Why not just use a traditional pool that doesn't take that cut, giving you more rewards consistantly?  The only real reason mining pools are successful is the ability to propagate blocks more quickly across their networks, giving them a couple milliseconds headstart on mining the next block.  
In order for a reddit mining cooperative to be successful, you'd need to bring something new to the table that others aren't already doing better.

[Deterministic wallets]( generate and use multiple addresses derived from a single private key. This allows you to create a new address each time you want to receive bitcoins, yet still have the same password and private keys for those wallets. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:16:06
An incentive to do so.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:58:48
Between GDAX and Coinbase it's free since they're technically the same company and most likely the same orderbook.  
Once you leave their exchange and transfer via blockchain, you pay fees, though from what [probablymy9thaccount]( is saying, you can transfer from GDAX via the blockchain and they'll cover the network fees. While not impossible, I've never tried, but it seems they'd lose a large amount of money doing this if it were true. (upwards of $5 every time someone did it) 
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:29:33
I must have completely misunderstood your intentions. I was thinking you were trying to "recreate the wheel" by redesigning mining pools.. I'll have to reconsider your proposal, but the most difficult part would be transparency and proving that you weren't squandering a % of the profits instead of reinvesting.

I do not believe so, but I'm not exactly sure.. I'm not perfectly sure how the addresses are generated, and what function the mouse randomization is used for in that generation.  
With all 3 having different public keys and different private keys, I believe the only way you'd be able to find all three would be by knowing the randomized dataset that generated those wallets to begin with. If that's true, it'd be possible for bitaddress.org or someone man-in-the-middling them to have gathered that information, and to connect the dots.  
This is, I believe, why most people who are concerned with anonymity would suggest you to generate those wallets on a machine not connected to the internet and not to let a website generate your keys for you.

Except when the fed prints more money, they've literally created more dollars, thereby making the previously created dollars worth less (deflation). With Bitcoin, you're not creating anything more when you divy a coin up, you're simply getting smaller fractions.

For added anonymity, exchange for an alt coin and move those coins around to another exchange, to buy BTC again. Perfectly clean coins.

This is deceptive at best.  
You won't consider the coin Bitstamp is using "Bitcoin" due to your idiotic definitions of Bitcoin (BP100/101,etc), therefore won't allow bitstamp exchange discussion unless it involves a coin other than bitcoin. Explain to me where I'm wrong.

My bank allows me to overdraft because I have direct deposit setup, but could also use overdraft protection if I desired to. I've been $-550 before because of a coinbase withdrawl, so it all depends on your bank.

Nope, anything that can be done at home can be done more efficiently in a data center designed specifically for that purpose. As soon as DIY mining becomes cheap enough, there will be a new flood of money in to soak up the profits created by doing so.

As if it's okay for one person to deem the internet's largest bitcoin discussion board off-limits for bitcoin growth discussion.

Right, he isn't forcing anyone to do anything: He's prohibiting intelligent debate about a topic that is very central and relevant to everything bitcoin, including it's growth and development. To ignore that, is to ignore reality.

Sure, but not the identity of who was behind each transaction. All that is public is the public key used to transmit the transaction. Any person any can make as many bitcoin wallet addresses as they like, and never give their identity to anyone.

I've been a follower since the first time I saw you on reddit months ago, patiently waiting for my bank to be added. I finally got the email a couple weeks ago to beta test this update, and my first change-to-BTC withdraw occurred just a couple days ago, no effort, no pain..   
I love the idea. I love the way in which it's executed. I love everything Lawnmower. I just wish the app had a interface that's easier to look at and navigate. What's there now works, it just doesn't provide enough options or interaction for the user.  
I'm sure you guys have something planned, so I'm excited to see what's next for Lawnmower.  Thanks for your hard work!

They can provide a different BTC address to each user that wants to deposit, and none of those users ever has to tell which address they deposited to. There's no way to find this information out unless one of those 2 parties reveals it. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 23:01:23
No, but it sounds like an interesting idea. The difficulty would be in how to allow each user to opt-in or opt-out of specific loans, and how to properly calculate the corresponding payments; I'm sure it can be done though.

You'll receive the price of BTC at the time at which you purchased it. They've essentially set those coins off to the side until your bank transfer has completed.

The ability to set limit orders, mostly, I'd imagine. In case I want to set orders to buy/sell at a set price, and not sit and wait for the market to move where I need it to be. I've got limit orders all the way down the books. If BTC hit $100 tomorrow, I'd have trades triggering left and right. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 16:17:42
All exchanges offer limit orders, where you're set to buy as soon as/whenever the market reaches your designated price.  
Buy limit order @ $300 and Sell limit order @ $400..

I was being facetious :)  
Alpraking used to be a vendor on the darknet bitcoin markets (SR1, Agora, Evolution, AlphaBay, Hansa, etc.) that sold Xanax from Canada to the US via mail. He netted 1000s of transactions before retiring from the markets, but still remains active providing insight and intelligence to members of the darknet markets.  
The "Carmen Sandiego" reference was a TV show in the 1990s that centered around contestants being given clues to a person (Carmen's) location and using those clues, the contestants competed to be the first to determine where she was.  
US law enforcement would do anything in their shady powers to get their hands on Alpraking because of the amount of BTC he's believed to posses.

@_date: 2015-11-06 18:09:07
At a time when the overall market was still very small and subject to manipulation by the exchanges, there was a surge of adoption spurred by publicity that caused the supply of BTC for sale to be overwhelmed to the point where nobody wanted to sell any of their coins unless you were willing to pay above market value. This spiraled out of control when FOMO (fear of missing out) kicked in, causing the price to get "pumped" to levels that were irrational and temporary, causing mass sell offs, followed by slow and more gradual sell offs until a price floor is created, this time around $250.    
The only real difference between then and now is the number of people transacting. With more buyers and sellers comes more liquidity in the market, meaning it's easier to buy and sell large transactions without causing large price swings. This also means there's more resistance to price movements, and thus more organic movements instead of few parties manipulating small markets.

If you can get the routing &amp; account number from one of those cards, you could do a standard ACH transaction (like writing them a check) instead of a debit/credit transaction.. It'd take 3-5 days to clear, so it wouldn't be instant, but you'd get the price that was agreed upon at the initiation of the transaction, and you wouldn't have to pay their $2-3 fees that are charged with instant transactions..
