Good article but title is misleading. BIU's are electronic devices...just not personal electronic devices.
I'm actually proposing a method to conduct Bitcoin transactions using both smoke and hand signals. 
Watch for my white paper...

It's not just about the State. Bitcoin is a threat to commercial banks, which Left Wing liberals like myself abhor. Ever hear of the Occupy Movement?
I also own some Bitcoin.

No. Not a clue. It sounds like you're looking for one of the history sub reddits. This is a Bitcoin sub. Does anyone know what llansky's talking about?

In other words, online, centralized value storage is a bad idea.

It doesn't really matter how infinitely divisible bitcoins are....if they can disappear, they can disappear.  If one unit can disappear, they all can disappear.

Well, I'm fairly new to Reddit, even though I've had internet access since the late '90's. Just never got around to joining or browsing here. So what do I know?
It does say "QuoteMe-Bot", though. And who would waste their time manually seeking out phrases to quote on Reddit?
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:00:58
Heh...It seems they are being inconsistent, if I am understanding everything correctly. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 11:31:06
I'm not going to reveal their name because I don't want fights to break out over this. 
I think it says a lot that the mods of this group posted it. If they were so hell bent on censoring people, I wouldn't expect them to post this at all after reviewing it.
I hope both sides can just get past this or just agree to disagree with no bad feelings.
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:00:22
I agree. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:16:21
I actually agree with that because they can't really kill Bitcoin with a straight face. If they do it would reek of inconsistency. 
On the one hand some people want to dismiss it as play money with no future that's used only to hide transactions. But on the other they want to tax it like it has value. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:41:05
Doesn't matter. Clinton (or Democrats) also won the popular vote. If you transfer all that bank money back into the hands of the populous through mass adoption of Bitcoin, where do you think the bulk of that money will go in election season?
Without the banks to appease the Democrats will be free to please their constituents on financial issues. 
And don't get me wrong, the same could be said for Republicans. 
But do you think Republicans would be more willing to see commercial banks go under than Democrats?
Democrats reluctantly covet bank money because they have to compete with republicans for that money. But if you take that funding source out of the picture, it's a different story.
No way in hell are Rebulicans going to get my money. Nor that of every rich Hollywood liberal.

That is brilliant. 
However, if that is not currency creation (but simply divisibility), are you saying satoshi's are infinitely divisible?

I wonder what the rate of loss will be once millions to billions of people are using Bitcoin.
With only a total circulation of 21 million bitcoins how long before all bitcoins are lost?
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:57:15
I'm starting to form my own theory.
The steady rise is the real performance of Bitcoin.
The spikes and crashes are the hype.
When something Bitcoin related hits the news, a bunch of people get on board (spike) and when it doesn't perform to their expectations, a bunch of people drop off (crash).
But that's all hype generated and conceals bitcoin's real performance.
The real Bitcoin is that steady rise under the hype generated mass reactions of buy and sell.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:15:59
I'm a relative Bitcoin novice but, basically, I believe it will make it legal for trading houses to offer Bitcoin to their customers as an investment option. 
But don't quote me on that. 
In other words, it will fuel mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:30:17
But if there is a rate of loss where a certain percentage lose their wallets, say, every year, with a limited supply, how can bitcoin avoid eventually disappearing?

My philosophy is down spikes are not loses if they come off up spikes.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:33:51
 &gt;&gt;This not what Bitcoin was trying to avoide?
Yes and no.
Mainstream adoption is helpful. On the other hand, that comes with regulation.
But our current currency is already regulated so adoption of Bitcoin to the marginalization of commercial banks would be a net gain for Bitcoin. Right now we have commercial banks AND regulation. If Bitcoin is mass adopted, we will only have to deal with government regulation.
Regulation is kind of a separate issue that can be challenged or amended later.

Isn't Reddit wasting valuable server space to have a bot reply every time someone types "don't quote me on that"?

Don't quote me on that.

I guess this is a difficult question to answer. It would seem to be important to know, however.
Or do I not understand wallets?
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:42:15
I know little about the technical details of this feud but aren't we talking about software when it comes to digital currency?
Can't both sides just agree to try one fix first and if that doesn't work go with another?
What's the big deal?

Yep. I follow all the videos and interviews. 
I'm reading the book now, which is a superb addition to his work.
The movie looks even better than the book going by the trailer. 
The guy is an incredible researcher. Just before I discovered TZM I was writing a sci-fi novella based on a similar train of thought. (In fact, I discovered Peter and his work while trying to answer a question for my book by typing in "resource based economy" into a search engine.)
I chose sci-fi instead of non-fiction only because I knew I just didn't have it in me to do the research for a non-fiction treatment of a RBE. 
That should tell you how highly I respect Peter for putting himself through the torture of research needed for a serious, non-fiction treatment of the topic. 
And then he also turns around and does the fictional treatment. ��
Mad, mad respect.

A Bitcoin atm is a vending device that sends bitcoins to your wallet. It usually accepts cash, credit, etc..

Instead of testing it as a side chain of Bitcoin, how about testing any fix proposals as new alt coins? That way you don't have to experiment with Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-04-11 10:39:52
I guess one of my points is, if it took a genius to create Bitcoin, why not consult one (perhaps the same one) to fix it?

I guess the fork debate isn't as big a problem as it's made out to be online if Japan just recognized Bitcoin as a payment alternative and Russia is set to legalize it by 2018?
It doesn't make sense for Japan to do that if Bitcoin has that big of a scaling issue. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 10:46:46
Btw, do you know if it's possible to simulate large network volume transactions with computer programs?
My thinking is, if we can create a computer simulation of the future large capacity Bitcoin network and examine how it performs in the simulation, we could possibly determine what is truly the best fix. We could punch in the different solutions, see how they fair against each other in the simulation and then choose the one that performs the best.
I mean, they have computer models for even the most complex future climate change scenarios...why not one for a future Bitcoin?
