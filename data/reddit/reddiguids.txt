Both I guess. I am very intrigued with this move towards transparent valuta, though practically to make cash. In the Netherlands you can't pay anywhere with bitcoin. Thus, having them is like a savings account.

Ok... But should I buy now?

I am a starter with reading bitcoin graphs. Can someone explain why this sudden increase happend? It jumped from 575 to 588 (xbteur). is it just someone working the market or is there something more fundamental happing?

thank you, this is a very clear explanation. And as you explained, it makes sense to get rid of anonymity all together since it has several advantages such as a transparent system.
But then again, one of the reasons why one would want to by-pass banks is such that they do not have insights in your account. You might run in to trouble when trying to get a loan for example. 
Now, if transactions can be linked back to identities, then any third-party could analyse this data and make a profile of you. 
Sorry, I do not want to come over as paranoid. haha. i just want to understand what i am getting into (unlike when I opened my first bank account)

I am new to bitcoin so please go easy on me. 
If you register for clevercoin and buy bitcoin threw the airbitz app, don't you loose anonymity?

So, Bitpay is made by the copay guys? Should I switch to this?

How can you agree to that. That price hasn't been seen in months

I don't understand this, why is ETH expected to go down whereas BTC isn't?
