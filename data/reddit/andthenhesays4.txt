I read your whole post and I understand your position. Sorry if I'm harping on the one part too much but really though...
There is no middle ground when it comes to encryption. Encryption is designed to protect your privacy from everyone except the person you are giving the information to. If you allow a 3rd party access to that information, the encryption is no longer fulfilling its purpose.
I'm not saying Clinton is evil. She's just dishonest and will do whatever is politically convenient at the time. If she said she's for a backdoor then the media would lambaste her and quote Snowden. Therefore, she doesn't say that but she still produces an answer that will ensure the Republicans won't be able to destroy her as being lax on terrorism.
She's pretty smart and you can guarantee that her advisors prepped her on the encryption question and told her to say this in order to tow the middle line. She's playing it safe so she doesn't jeopardize her Presidential nomination which she surely has in the bag. But, once/if she wins...you can guarantee she's going to be pushing for that backdoor if the majority of US citizens decide that they don't care about the issue or that they care about protection from terrorism more than privacy.

Quite a shame really. I'd prefer the person remain anonymous...then no one can dissect every little thing he/she does to somehow discredit Bitcoin.

She's using her standard shtick. She said she didn't want a backdoor but then goes on to talk about a Manhattan project to solve the problem, essentially a backdoor under a new name.


Wow, it looks like her slick way of speaking worked on you unfortunately. If a government has access to crack encryption, they can do it for everyone. A backdoor is a backdoor. This is something that would be acceptable to many consumers who don't fully understand the implications of it. Don't call it a backdoor, call it a Manhattan project and peoples' eyes glaze over and they nod with agreement.

So is Argentina and (better yet) Venezuela.

Months of delay for a withdrawal? On an exchange? How is that acceptable to you?

Circle and Coinbase both booted me off their platforms because I was a relatively frequent BTC seller. I had a legitimate business but they banned me anyways. Fuck them I will just use Kraken.

Behind every fiat currency, there are men with guns. This is the true reason why Bitcoin, as it was originally conceived, is the truth. It's an actual currency with real value determined by the PEOPLE, not because of men with guns. It's beautiful, it's freedom. If America ceased to exist tomorrow, the US dollar would be worthless. Bitcoin would not become worthless just because a country collapses etc.

The rating agencies that rated bonds triple A which later proved to be filled with terribly bad mortgage loans should've been charged with securities fraud. Let's start there.

That's great. I did a bank wire from USA to India for $3,000 USD and the process was terrible. My programmer said he didn't get the money so I did a trace. Apparently it was just stuck at the Central bank. Once I saw that I contacted them immediately through my banker and ONLY THEN 3 weeks after the wire was placed did the Central bank inform me I needed to fill out their form. The info on the form WAS THE EXACT SAME THING required for any international wire when you fill in the info, except it had a Central Bank watermark. Sheer bureaucratic idiocy that has perpetuated from the British colonial days to the present. Either that or these Central bank guys are just incompetent/lazy. After I submitted the form, I didnt hear back from them for another solid 5 business days. So I said fuck this and  recalled the wire. What's next?
Well, the programmer said that we could try Bitcoin...I didnt even know that was an option!! He sent me a wallet address and I had that transaction done in 30 seconds with basically zero cost to me, as opposed to expensive wire fees.
If this picks up in India that's game over!! It will be so easy to pick up people to do quick coding work and you wont have to jump through hoops or pay a bunch of money at once in a wire. You can pay daily or weekly with the click of a button!
Same use case can apply to other restrictive banking countries like Argentina, Belize, etc.

Think this news story is causing a spike?

Bitcoin remittance back to India is a no brainer! I tried to convince my Indian co-workers to do this instead of WU or bank transfers or whatever other expensive way they were doing it before  But they got old school parents who dont even use computers really :p

That would be good to know. Push it up to $25 or $50 or $100...i want to see those numbers... or monthly avg flow thru of BTC for Indians' wallets

Circle --&gt; Bitcoin --&gt; Other Circle Account Holder --&gt; Bank 
For this method, BTC is waaaayyyy cheaper than traditional bank transfer (two different non-partner banks) and cheaper than Western Union.
