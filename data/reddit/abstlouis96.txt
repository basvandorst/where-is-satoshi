How can I short Bitcoin?

He says that that value of cryptocurrencies will be null when a central bank issues its own cryptocurrency. Would you pick that one apart? He starts that talk around the 3:00 minute mark

Around the 4:50 mark he mentions that the exchanges are mostly unregulated and claimed that people's bitcoins have "disappeared" during these shady transactions. He did not clarify what he meant by "disappeared" but how big of a concern is the potential danger of having one's bitcoin stolen or manipulated?

I just don't see how having money that is not regulated have consistent value. The big questions for me is why is Bitcoin volatile? Does it matter if it's volatile for the purposes of having it as currency? and why is there more than one cryptocurrency?

Some of you say the man in the video does not understand cryptocurrencies and therefore his arguments are hard to take seriously. I apologize for that. I have been trying to comprehend bitcoin and until this video I've heard nothing but good things, being a skeptic I wanted to find an expert who knows the topic well and can voice his/her criticisms without basing it on misconceptions. I made a bad judgement call with this video and I appreciate those who pointed it out.

I'm assuming Bitcoin can't be all bad nor all good. Until now it's been nothing but good, the volatility is scary and I want to disregard bitcoin on that basis alone. However, I want to go further, but I feel my mindset is looking at bitcoin from the wrong perspective. It's not just the advantages and disadvantages, but I need to identify a purpose to correlate with the advantage and disadvantage, for a currency I think bitcoin is astoundingly volatile. One day I'll be able to pay rent, the next I can barely afford milk. As something to invest in for short term gain at high risk, it's perfectly understandable no qualms with that. 
That's what Im trying to wrap my head around. I know it's a digital currency that is not centralized, issued by a federal reserve, or regulated. It's a network or basically pure trade between a buyer and a seller with no bank in between, basically you are your own bank. And I don't understand how it is "mined" or what mining is? 
That's where I am and it's all over the place.

I thought he seemed to understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. But surely you must have had some doubts? Or could you tell me some common misconceptions about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:42:23
But could a central bank's cryptocurrency cause a drop in bitcoin's value? 
Your answer seems to say people believe in cryptocurrencies because it can't be directly manipulated by government regulation but what about indirectly like the video suggested?
