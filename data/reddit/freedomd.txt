The only thing that makes a million dollar valuation realistic any time soon is gross inflation of the dollar. Either way it looks like btc is heading up in purchasing power.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:15:10
But if you had valuable business emails/contacts in that system, that would be worth a lot of money. That's why real businesses back up their email systems... and smart BTC users keep their funds off exchanges.

Hey Addison,
Thanks for the feedback. I've been doing some research on shipping. It looks like I can fit 2 bags into a USPS flat rate envelope or box just under $6. I adjusted my rates to $4.95 to reflect that.
Regarding subscriptions, that's a great idea. I know some companies do it. I'll see how I can possibly make that work with bitcoin and shopify, but for the time being I can take care of you personally/manually.
What kind of coffee do you normally buy?
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:09:49
Ha that's awesome. I also debated about ordering using a gift card from Amazon, but ended up liking a mattress on Overstock a little more. I'm tempted to try a Tuft and Needle mattress, but I think they are probably mostly good internet marketing for the same quality as the other budget mattresses.

If you buy just one bag that may be true, however a lot of people don't have a high quality coffee roaster down the street. For many people coffee is just a commodity, and that's fine. This isn't stale commodity grade coffee.
I'm going to be playing with the pricing, but $12-20 is fair market price for this quality of coffee. Shipping is flat rate up to 5 bags. When I have bought from other specialty roasters in the past I paid similar prices.
If specialty coffee isn't your thing, this might not be the right product for you right now.
However, for people who prefer the highest quality coffee, sourced ethically, and would like to pay with BTC, this is the coffee for them.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:20:13
Thanks for the feedback. I'm iterating on this project all the time. The shipping is flat rate for 5 bags. I'll have to look into this a bit more.
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:58:57
If that's all it ever amounted to I'll buy physical assets. BTC might never work well for currency, but for international remittance it's a game changer.

1. My payments arrive to my bank account in USD
2. Amazon/Paypal nearly automatically charge my credit card
3. My credit card auto-drafts it's payment from my bank account
When Bitcoin is this easy for the majority of my transactions I will have no need for USD and it will eliminate the need for the 2nd step.
1. Bitcoin in.
2. Bitcoin out.
It isn't that easy yet. Almost, but not quite. Overstock.com doesn't have everything I need. Amazon requires an extra manual stop at Gyft. Reduce the friction, make it save them money, make it painless, and the masses will buy in.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:49:34
That does seem to damper the excitement a bit. So what then... Food, drinks, rooms?
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:43:54
I would do it. I would have to sell my house for bitcoin unless I could pay it off with bitcoin - interesting situation there - but other than that I could figure out how to survive on gyft cards for a few years.
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:03:18
I'm in a similar bracket. My first major investment was real estate in 2012 - a 3 unit building. I still have it. Have made quite a decent amount of equity over the last couple years in Phoenix. I would love to buy 3-5 more of these over the next decade.
The next bigger investment was in 2013 - a smaller than $20k but quite a bit larger than $1k. Very glad I did it. Have held it all as I'm still young and could see it going quite a bit further if not "all the way".
If you have your main ducks in a row I would say go for it. Drive a cheaper reliable car and dump some money in safe and risky investments while you're young.
@_date: 2014-05-02 06:39:47

They get around it with USD. They bring their family, friends, servants, employees... to the bank and have "them" transfer the money to a US account. Bring 20 people to the bank a year, and you've got a mil. Sure it's more work than most of us have to put up with, but just going to the bank in China is a pain.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:56:10
Well since you have an indirect connection why don't you schedule a meeting with him. Ask why he is anti BTC and, irregardless of the current BTC economy, ask him about the tech itself.
My brother is a financial planner and very conservative financially. He is so anti BTC and was really worried about me in Dec. I've been slowly having these talks with him. He'll come around eventually.
@_date: 2014-04-10 08:20:41
$50k a year is the same limit as buying foreign currency in China. This seems inline with their current laws towards any currency that isn't RMB.

I like their approach. Get the consumer to see what that credit card is costing them.
Dumb consumers will see it as they are getting charged extra. I think it's better marketing to be offering a discount for BTC rather than charge extra for CC.

The problem as I understand inflation is prices typically adjust faster than wages. The producers adapt quickly to the inflation rate by appropriately raising prices. "Ideally" this would eventually result in increased profits and raised wages, but it tends to lag behind inflation's pace.

Making loans is not fractional reserve. If I have 1 dollar, and lend you 10 digital dollars I don't actually have, that is fractional reserve. I reserved/held back 1/10 of the loan. Then you go deposit it in your bank, and they do the same thing. That's the big messy problem with fractional reserve banking (as I understand it, I could be misunderstanding).
@_date: 2014-04-10 08:17:26
Cool idea. I really do see the importance of it being integrated into Gyft.com. Say I want to buy a Gyft card for Ybiz in NY, and they use Gyft Cloud. Maybe I live in SF, but my cousin lives in NY and loves Ybiz. Being able to make that purchase on Gyft.com would make it possible.
Also, implementing a localized Gyft.com like Groupon would allow someone to search for businesses in their own area, purchase credit w/ btc, and give those small local businesses internet presence they wouldn't normally have. Wins all around. I think getting Gyft Cloud integrated into Gyft.com should be a priority.
Now I'm gonna go buy localGyft.com : )

I'm bummed for you and the China situation. I was getting really excited for China with the positive news we've had in the last few weeks. Bitcoin would be huge in a market like China.

That model is very proven. I read an article about how Target can figure out who you are by just a few uses of their membership card. Then the mailers you receive are targeted :P based on what they know about the customer.
Now get this: they sent "congrats on the pregnancy" coupons to a teenage girl's parent's house who hadn't told anyone she was pregnant yet. Target got some flack for that one.
Customer profile information is a huge business and it isn't going anywhere unless you move to the woods and start reading Mother Earth News.

I can set up a mom and pop shop with an iPad or android. I can also set up Shopify and Wordpress for btc payments. I can't do API development to tie together pre-existing systems, but I could connect businesses with developers who can.

Look up self directed IRA
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:20:13
I'm not in the adult industry but I need subscription/recurring billing as well.
@_date: 2013-06-10 02:24:31
Nice, I'll download it this afternoon and start playing with it.

Lol "the abandoned house at the end of street sure does get a lot of deliveries"
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:06:35
ha seriously. blogspot is classy.

Wrong sr - you're lookin for @_date: 2013-12-04 20:26:35
It's probably 3 guys on rotation, maybe another part timer.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:19:27
Wow that is awesome. I'm not into gaming but that looks like a blast!

There has already been a lot of talk of moving to pricing on mBTC. 1 BTC = 1000 mBTC, so a $5 beer would be 5 mBTC or 0.005 BTC.

No Regrets is also a national show truck club, and some of them are into tattooing as well.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:24:03
So I re-downloaded bitcoin bleep and let it run. It is a great app. Totally recommend once I understood how it worked.

And the satisfaction of stealing from your employer.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:43:36
I think you can hold anything but art and collectables in a self directed IRA. This includes properties and metals. I would think it would include bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:15:19
That's seriously a market potential right there
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:45:07
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:42:00
Are you in the mini truck club?
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:09:17
I have seen a lot of conservative financial advice, but this is the most bunkhouse money tip I've ever seen. Make sure you buy 5 years of canned goods and start raising chickens as well.

Last year when u was teaching there I sent home money once through btc. If I had a little more foresight I would have saved some every month in it. It's so much easier if you're in a larger city with someone on localbitcoin.com. I was in Qingdao.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:35:48
Well most businesses are going to want deposits in fiat to pay their expenses. They would need Bitpay or Coinbase accounts to automate that process.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:32:23
I think it means x% of market price based, rather than x% of btc
@_date: 2013-11-17 07:27:47
Maybe a new one like Square... Local food trucks and coffee shops use it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:59:13
Ya. I left Wells Fargo to go to a local credit union earlier this year, BUT I kept the account open just specifically for transfers to Coinbase. Maybe they'll get the point, but I doubt it.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:30:42
Let them give you money, make donations in your name, or get you gifts. But as for the cause... Giving bitcoin as wedding favors could be an option.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:22:46
I went ahead and purchased the upgrade for the alerts. Hopefully this works the way I want it to.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:13:48
Oops? That's an incredible tip!
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:13:39
This guy knows what's up. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:18:02
Maybe, but worst I had was in China, except the western style restaurants that expected tipping. YMMV
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:26:21
This is unfortunately true. Also, different aspects of the Chinese government disagree and want different things. There are probably factions within the government that are for and against BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:40:49
I dropped WF like a bad habit and went to a local credit union. No regrets.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:53:03
That sounds like a great idea until you go to a country where tips aren't customary. The worst service I've ever had.
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:15:55
Ya I have a watch I need fixed.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:25:59
He's not saying selling is noobish. He's saying if you're a dumb noob don't freak out (like I did back in April). Learn the game before a noob start making big bets.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:49:49
Lmao this is what I thought. But um GLWS :)
@_date: 2013-09-01 12:39:05
I've purchased from them. Reliable international delivery.

Ya Mt Gox Live would be so sick on this thing. :P
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:22:09
I can't wait to watch Mt Gox Live on this thing. It's gonna be insane!

Pretty soon we will refer to years as bM and aM, before moon and after moon

It's no amazon, but not bad for a new business with a niche payment system.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:32:24
I grew up in a town of 600 with 2 or 3 policemen. Then moved to a town of 4,000 with a small team. Different states different laws.

Currently no iOS version. Sounds perfect for what I want.
