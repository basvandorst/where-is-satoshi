Just to put this into context JP Morgan pays fines that cost more than all the bitcoin in existance.
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:17:54
But do they actually charge your credit card?  That's where I wasn't clear.  I thought they charged your bank account and only used the credit if there weren't sufficient funds in the bank account.  In other words it's not really a method to purchase with a credit card.

Sure.  But it's never apples to apples.  If I get mugged for cash I might wind up in the hospital (ouch) and have long term complications.  If I keep everything in cash I will lose some of it to inflation.  I've been passed counterfeit notes before -- I don't see that happening with small bitcoin transactions.  I just think the instances of bitcoin fraud of blown out of proportion.  I mean JP Morgan was fined more than to total value of bitcoin.  How much money have people lost from those criminals?  Or Madoff?  Or Corzine?  Or Cyprus?  The amount lost in bitcoin is minuscule.

I've received discounts for cash when I've purchased:  auto repairs, furniture, sunglasses, and a watch.  That's all I can think of right now.  The thing is none of these discounts are advertised.  I'm the type of person who will ask for a discount on expensive things and I also bring cash when I'm going to make a large purchase.  It makes a difference.

I don't blame Bitpay.  They're an Atlanta company (I think -- they might be incorporated in DE like everyone else) so I don't see how this would work on any level.  The shops should start taking bitcoin and start spending it.  I'm sure they could use some soap &amp; honey &amp; gyft cards &amp; cheap air tickets, etc etc.  How did they get this far without being creative &amp; taking risks?

No thank you.  My bet on bitcoin is represented by the amount I own now and buy/sell in the future.  I could also buy a derivative if I wanted.  
Also I'm fine with pegging to USD (I'm guessing that was a smartass swipe).  I see the main utility of Bitcoin as a store of value first, and a transaction network second.  The value as a currency in and of itself is a distant third.

You can buy bitcoin derivatives now if you want.  The speed of the transaction network is a valid concern -- I am hopeful that it can be improved similar to the way that other technology improves.
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:41:25
The idea behind Bitcoin is it can't be manipulated.  Derivatives &amp; Credit Default Swaps, etc aren't intrinsically bad -- it's the manipulation and fraud that made them bad.  LIBOR is the biggest public example of that.  With Bitcoin this type of manipulation isn't possible because it's a public ledger.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:59:14
The merchants are using the Bitcoin network.  That's one aspect of Bitcoin.  There is plenty of value and utility in the network on its own.  Now if your entire goal is to get people to use Bitcoin as a currency I can see why you'd be disappointed but Bitcoin is more than a currency.

Wikileaks wasn't doing anything illegal so that's an argument but the point of bitcoin isn't to force payment providers to do XZY, it's to avoid payment providers (including Bitpay) altogether.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:17:03
My point was there is value to getting something now.  People who fret about deflationary currency fail to understand humans or the more radical idea that producing more might not be the best goal -- maybe the best goal is to maximize value and increase leisure?  I don't know but I think the idea of a deflationary currency challenges many assumptions.
@_date: 2014-01-17 20:52:22
Once you kill fungibility you kill Bitcoin.  People are always tempted to blacklist &amp; whitelist coins but it's a terrible idea because you have a third party determining the "morality" of specific coins and the the coins no longer have the same value.  This is the surest way to kill off Bitcoin.

EBT cards are physical charge cards that the government gives poor people.  The cards are loaded with money to use for food.  Since Walmart typically appeals to poor people they get a lot of revenue from the welfare cards.  Personally I don't see the government using this program to give Walmart a hard time from taking bitcoin.

Personally I think it's easier to pay with bitcoin than it is with a credit card but you may disagree.  Many of the merchants I've used have provided discounts that aren't available to cc customers.  Plus it's nice using $100 worth of money today that only cost me $20.

This is an old and tired argument.  Why do people choose to take out massive mortgages when they could just live in a shit-hole forever?  Why ever buy a computer or a car when next year's model will be better?  There are always reasons to spend money because time is finite.  The good thing about a deflationary currency is that it compels you to think about your purchases and you're less likely to waste money.

I skimmed through so forgive me if someone mentioned this.  Would it be feasible to create maintain a pool of bitcoin for returns?  For example park 10 bitcoin in an account specifically for returns.  This way if you ever have to make refund you just use the account.  Yes, this would give the company exposure to bitcoin fluctuation but that might turn into a benefit.

It's a Schedule 1 drug!  People are sitting in jail right now because it's illegal.  
Nothing is gained trying to placate DoctorJason's feelings when Bitpay has a strict No Drug policy.

I go to website that takes cc or bitcoin.  
With bitcoin I enter my name &amp; shipping address and take a picture of the QR code.  Done.
With cc I have to sign up for a fucking account or if I'm lucky use a guest account.  Usually with another password that I don't want because I'm just trying to buy something not form a long term relationship.

I'm not being sarcastic.  I hate civil asset forfeiture but that's not my point.  My point is that I am happy that they proactively put in the line that  Bitcoin is OK.  It's allowed and it's legal and having bitcoin doesn't make you a criminal.  This is a huge chance.

I might be missing something but I'm assuming that if it is being used for this application then the exchange value needs to be enough to handle the volume.  If I'm transferring $1 worth then there has to be at least $1 worth to send.  Using easy numbers let's say that the current value of all existing bitcoin is $10 billion.  Now let's say that only $2 billion of that is available because the rest is "offline" (lost, long term savings, hoarders, etc).  Now if you need to transfer $10 billion worth then the existing $2 billion goes up 5x.

FT says below $50.  Don't hate.
Will the value of Bitcoin fall below $50?
Yes. The price of a Bitcoin recently touched $1,200. Enthusiasts point out that the virtual currency cannot be minted at a central banker’s whim. But its value regularly moves by 10 per cent overnight. That is confounding if you strike a deal one day and pay up the next. Even on Silk Road, the secret website where Bitcoins were traded for illegal drugs, prices were generally quoted in dollars. As a currency, Bitcoin will never catch on.
More video
Chinese investors are said to favour Bitcoins as a way of evading capital controls. Others believe that prices can only go up. Yet governments could easily shut down the exchanges where virtual cash can be swapped for hard currency. China dealt a blow to investors this month with its sadistic decision not to ban the digital tokens outright but to prohibit purchases of Bitcoin. Speculators need only fear similar moves elsewhere for Bitcoin to lose its value. So, expect prices to fall. But do not bet on the timing: as Keynes pointed out, markets can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent. Mark Vandevelde

I think being a scientologist is much more expensive.  To your point, I'm rejecting pigeonholing bitcoin into one singular thing because it isn't a true reflection of what it actually is.  Usually when people raise issues about bitcoin not working as a currency they are trying to get it in a world where bitcoin is used exclusively (i.e. now one is going to price in bitcoin).  I'm challenging the notion that that's a problem.  Who cares?  Denominate everything in USD or RMB or whatever.

It isn't a Ponzi scheme because a Ponzi scheme is a specific type of fraud.  
In the scheme, all returns (profits) are paid with new money coming in to invest.  There aren't any actual returns and most of the underlying investment doesn't exist either.  
The simple example is you give me $1000 and I pay you a 10% return of $100.  You think that you can cash out the original $1000 whenever you want but you can't because it's gone.  I've taken it.  I'm using new investors' money to pay you the fake "profit."

Based on your response, I wouldn't worry too much about coinbase being popular.  
It's a little complicated but the way coinbase works is they hold everyone's bitcoin until the buyer/owner moves the bitcoin out of coinbase.  So what that means is I bought bitcoin from coinbase.  I have it in their wallet.  If I buy from one of their customers it's basically coinbase moving the bitcoin from my account to yours.  So it's faster with no confirmations.  But honestly it's not that big of a deal.  
Everyone can spend using their bitcoin no matter which vendor you use -- or even if you just want to hold.
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:51:22
Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

My initial thought is he'd be lucky to get more than $200/month in bitcoin transactions.  With such a small amount it probably isn't worth the hassle to get set-up with bitpay/coinbase.  He could just pocket that money.  And the volatility concern is overblown for small dollar amounts.  Sure he could get really unlucky and his $10 bitcoin transaction drops to $5 and he loses $5 but if you look at the past year he has a much better chance of the $10 transaction being worth more.  Those Bee's Brothers kids sold a box of candy for 1.8 BTC!  
EDIT:  One more thing about volatility. I may be off a little but it looks like there are only 15 days that bitcoin was higher than it is today.  That means for 330+ days this year he'd be up if he held onto the bitcoin.

There's a lot going on in this question.  As a store of value, I think people will be incentivized to learn how to properly protect themselves.  In other words the prospect of getting an actual return on your money vs. losing money by keeping it in a bank will encourage people to do it properly.
Also, I'd like to have a better idea how many people are really being victimized.  How does it compare to people getting mugged?  Or typical fraudsters?  I don't know.  My guess is the risk is not as large as people think however it can be catastrophic.  Few people are going to lose more than $1000 getting mugged (although I'd rather avoid the possibility of physical violence).

Since many people in the US are using coinbase you might want to integrate with them.  It's very easy if they have the coinbase app on their phone.  The fee is .15 per swipe plus 1% once the promotional period expires.  Do you have good cell service where  you're at?  If you don't have a good signal it might not be practical.

I think bitcoin is valuable to people who don't have access to the entire financial system.  If you can't get a credit card or your bank wants to charge you $10 a month for a checking account or you have to pay fees to cash checks then you start to see the value of bitcoin.  If the bank is bending over backwards to give you all their services and cheap loans then bitcoin might not be that useful.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:02:37
This is really good.  There should be more focus on the point that  bitcoin is usually up.  Right now it's higher than it's been aside from 8 days!  Unless you're really unlucky you're up.

Sure we could drop 70%.  So all of a sudden he loses $21 on a $30 (out of the $200) order.  But then the rest of the time he's getting bitcoin at $250.  If it goes up 10% he gains $17 on the balance plus $3 on the pre-crash deal.  So he loses $1.  What I'm trying to get at is that with small volume the volatility isn't as big of a concern as people try to make it.

I've always thought that the "nice-nice" way of convincing people to use bitcoin wasn't going to go far enough.  Start tipping and paying people in bitcoin and they'll have to figure out how to use it.  Just like when companies stopped paying in cash.

I'm against the "yet."  It changes the question to a conversation and makes it sounds like you have an agenda (which you do!!!)  Also "yet" doesn't make them feel like they are behind the times.  It makes them feel like most people aren't doing it.  Just ask what you want to ask!  If they are open to taking it they'll ask you "what is that?" and think it was their idea to get info.  Sales 101.  :)

The other thing would be everyone deciding not to tip.  Then employers would have to pay the proper wage and increase prices accordingly.  I know it won't happen but it's so much easier in countries like Australia where you just pay the price and get on with your life.  In the US every transaction includes institutionalized begging (either from the owner or the server -- take your pick).

I don't know anything about eGold.  "Speculation" has such a bad reputation I'm not sure that I want to admit to it.  Sure, I'd like Bitcoin to go higher but my main goal is to get a 6% return in something that's liquid.  With my goal demand for Bitcoin could be flat or even decrease but it just has hold value better than USD.  Since USD is created at a faster rate than btc I think it's a safe strategy.

"Have you heard about Bitcoin?" sounds like you just want to have a chat.  "Do you take Bitcoin?" actually has something to do with their business at the crucial moment when you're getting ready to pay them.  They say "no" you hand them your cc and look sad and ask how much they have to pay to take a credit card.  3%? 4%?  is there a swipe fee?  Then you've actually got something to talk about.

Keep in mind the fees are to convert bitcoin into USD.  If you just want to keep bitcoin there isn't a fee.  Then you get the currency risk.
 
Coinbase is doing a promotion where the first $1,000,000 is free.  Bitpay has a different pricing model - but I don't think it would be good for you unless you see yourself getting $3000+ in bitcoin transactions.
