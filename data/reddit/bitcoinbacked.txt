The big question will be whether there were a) no limits on withdrawals, b) withdrawal limits that were not enforced or c) withdrawal limits that were bypassed. From the [BitGo FAQ] ( Bitfinex had up on their site it's pretty clear that somehow some part BitGo's security protocol was not working.

Just a word of caution, Lightning is still in Alpha and you are jeopardizing any money you tie up in it right now. I'm extremely optimistic about the future but we should still be working in testnet right now

The difficulty is that they still call themselves r/btc and tell everyone it's a bitcoin subreddit. So it's extremely confusing to new people and misleading since they don't support Bitcoin's reference implementation and protocol improvements (point of OP's post).
R/Ethereum is pretty explicit that it's not a bitcoin subreddit, so yours is not the best analogy.

Ah, I see it now thank you. Though I will say that's most likely a typographical error since they correctly define millibits as 1/1000 of bitcoin in the meat of the article. 
Most likely an editor going fast to put together a summary. On principle I don't read bitcoin.com but tone-wise this one sounded like they were on board with the change so I'm not going to get my pitchfork. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:01:55
They reference millibits, but I do not see what you're talking about after reading the entire article. I thought the article was pretty well balanced

While I agree the conclusions being drawn in the OP from testnet are a bit over-extended, as noted above we really shouldn't be too concerned with centralization in Layer2+ levels of the Bitcoin protocol. 
I think OP wanted to lash back at the bcashers that are constantly saying Lightning will be too centralized. But they've made their bed in terms of being stuck at Layer 1 and making that centralized by virtue of node cost, so no reason to listen to them anymore. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:27:58

Trusted third parties will always be a thing, because they're easy and efficient in the right circumstances. We're building a foundation with Bitcoin that mitigates the trust you need to place in others to only situations where it behooves you, rather than all the time (i.e., current fiat system)

Those coins only gain a foothold until they get to the same usability bottleneck as bitcoin though, and the hope would be by that point we're already fully implemented on SegWit and pushing ahead on Lightning.
There is now a profit incentive for businesses and individuals to solve fee concerns for themselves, so I expect fee estimation will get better and more off chain services will be provided.

Bitcoin is not a company or a start up. It is trying to be a new asset class. Because of this, we can't just take risks with a $300B network and if something goes wrong and people lose money say 'oh it's ok we'll fix that issue now'. Store of value requires trust, which takes years and years to build and can be destroyed overnight.

In what way are they outcompeting? These other cryptos would have the exact same issues if they had the level of usage bitcoin has. It's only with additional protocol layers that we'll actually be able to scale in a meaningful way
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:01:33
Good luck getting consensus on what to code as a hard fork in 6 months. Can it possibly be done? Technically yes, but this is a beast of a network and major changes like what you're talking about need to be handled with the utmost of care.
It took a year for SegWit to get implemented and even now adoption is still ticking up. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:13:29
That's a really good point about the order of operations needing store of value before anything else

That's sufficiently low that it will probably come back to you in another week or so, if not you'll want to use CPFP.
For future refer to that website, 3 sat/byte will almost assuredly never confirm in today's fee environment
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:52:58
Looks like you can get in relatively quickly with 140 sat/byte
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:27:45
As soon as SegWit becomes widely adopted (which takes time, we're talking about managing people's money here) we will see network capacity increase.
Even if we were to go the blocksize increase route, it would still probably be 2 years from now before it went live.

The Bitcoin as we know it today is more analogous to a settlement system than a payment system. So you're right, right now Bitcoin's major value proposition is as a store of value. It's inherently very expensive to store all those transactions on thousands of computers around the world for the rest of time if you want to keep it decentralized. 
If we have a truly decentralized and uncensorable protocol layer 1 (bitcoin as we know it today), what we can do is build on top of that, with additional layers like lightning that create instant payments that only settle on the blockchain to close channels and settle accounts. Beyond that there was a paper about creating an intermediary protocol level before lightning that would allow you to open and close payment channels without needing to post a layer 1 transaction every time.
That is how we scale this thing: **we make it so that a million transactions can go on top of each bitcoin transaction as we know it today (layer 1)**.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:15:44
It's basically a better gold right now, and hopefully we can scale it to be much more than that
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:17:05
Doubling the block size would happen if everyone used segwit. It will just take a little bit of time for all implementations to build it in.

Cash doesn't have consistently full blocks, even at 1 MB.
And Bitcoin will have 2 MB blocks when SegWit is fully used
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:46:01


LOL Did you just completely miss the whole SegWit2x dumpster fire? For a safe hard fork practically all nodes and miners have to be using compatible software, and those changes have to be coded and tested out the wazoo. You basically have to set a checkpoint well into the future so that it's a non-event when it happens, otherwise it gets really messy. 
You're taking crazy pills if you think that can all be done in 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:10:21
The blocksize *will* double once everyone is using SegWit

It just doesn't feel as meaningful if you go on national media to show everyone how great of a person you are. Hopefully the money gets put to good use, but I've always had far more respect for the people that donate anonymously.
I'm sure 'raising awareness' has a positive impact on the amount of money charities receive, but it just looks like virtue signaling to those of us that don't need the public recognition/adolation to feel good contributing. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:35:22
If the tx went to you, in mycelium you can construct a 'child pays for parent' (CPFP) transaction with the unconfirmed output. Basically you spend the unconfirmed output, but attach a fee high enough to get both that tx and the parent tx (the one that's a week old) confirmed shortly). 
If you look at the transaction details in mycelium there should be a CPFP option. I'm guessing it's not flagged as Replace By Fee (RBF), otherwise you could rebroadcast with a higher fee on the same tx and the miners would still include it (since it was marked RBF). 
Otherwise, depending on how low the fee is sat/byte I think most tx fall out of the mempool after two weeks, in which case you should be able to spend it again.
TL;DR CPFP is probably your best option, always check the mempool to validate the fee you selected isn't too low (but also isn't too high):
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:15:44
It's a transitory solution until SegWit gets wider adoption (will approximately double the effective block size) and lightning network becomes widely deployed (hundreds of tx can be generated with 1-2 on chain transactions).
If we are able to establish a highly credible store of value, I also expect that off chain solutions offered through trusted intermediaries (e.g., Visa bitcoin cards) can help bridge the payments gap as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:12:58
You should be able to see the transaction on the network if you go into the details and look at the block explorer link. It will have sent, just not confirmed yet.
How many Satoshi's per byte did you select for the transaction? Based on the mempool, you'd need 130-140 satoshis per byte to get confirmed relatively soon:
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:24:58
You could also get around this by using some sort of confidence estimation. Maybe 5% of coins that haven't been spent in the last year are lost, versus maybe 50% if they haven't moved since 2012, and maybe 90% are lost if they haven't moved since 2010.
It's all arbitrary estimates since there's no way of knowing, but I definitely agree with others that a year since moving is way too short. I have paper wallets lying around that I filled up in 2013, and I definitely still have those private keys
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:44:19
That's why 2nd layer is where it's at. Lightning has the potential to make payment channels approximate trust-less while avoiding on-chain bloat.

The attack began as soon as BU devs posted it on git, before any tweets/reddit posts went out.
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:31:07
The debate is about which implementation is the best one for bitcoin. BU is buggy and full of exploits, and the emerging consensus approach can be gamed to create massive perpetual blockchain re-orgs. 
Execution is more important than intent/philosophy.  
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:26:18
Something being safe because it's not worth attacking isn't necessarily the same thing as it being safe and stable code for the entire network to run on. The only thing we know is that Core has been able to support almost the entire network safely
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:19:24
To my knowledge the attack began before he published his tweet. The BU team made the mistake of correcting a 0 day out in the open when they should have merged it in private and notified people ahead of time that an urgent bug fix was coming. 
I would argue that if anything Peter may have given some folks the heads up by publicizing it and thus allowed them to upgrade faster than they normally would have. 
Don't try and pin this shit-show on anyone other than the BU devs.

Why should core devs be expected to spend time on a forked version of software they originally developed? That makes no sense.  
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:20:47
You're missing my point. It's not the copying part that's the problem, it's the expectation that the person I copied from has any obligation to review the changes I made to what was originally their work.  
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:14:45
The bug BU has was introduced because of changes they made to the original Core software they forked.

I feel like it might become a permanent fixture unless the artist won't allow it

And yet BU is blocking segwit, which would both increase on-chain capacity and provide the malleability fixes to enable layer-2 channels. Disingenuous argument.

This bug that crashed BU nodes had been out in the wild for over a year. It could very well be that minor implementations just don't have the attention of would be attackers. Crashing Core on the other hand would bring down almost the entire node network. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:48:37
The bug should never have existed in the first place if the code was properly reviewed, and the way they developed the patch should have been done in private and then released after a heads up to those running the software (e.g., 'tomorrow at 11 am UTC critical patch will be released, please run immediately') rather than discussed publicly on their git where the attacker found out about it. 
It's incompetence the whole way round.

Pushing forward a contentious hard fork *is* hostile since it guarantees a split in the coin. It's risking billions of dollars in market capitalization over ego. 
Increasing fees have created pressure for immediate solutions, which Segwit is, and would not require a hard fork. 
Every day that BU doesn't hit whatever arbitrary cutoff of hashing power they set to fork the consensus to BUCoin is another day that Core's superior developer resources keep improving that implementation. If BU supporters think that developers will just switch over because a few large miners decided BU was the way to go then they're taking crazy pills.  
The nodes are saying they support segwit, and I think businesses and investors will be highly skeptical of a dogmatic push to BUCoin by the miners, who by the way have the most power to gain from their proposed change in blocksize determination. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:56:01
You're confusing an individual user's decision on which software to use with a developer's decision on which implementation to work on. Who do you think these hundreds of qualified bitcoin code reviewers are, if not the core developers? 
So again I ask, why should the people qualified to review the BU code feel any inclination to do so when BU basically just mucked up a fork of these Core developers' original work?  
**Edit**: an additional note. This bug was created because of changes the BU developers made to the original bitcoin core fork they used. Can you imagine someone copying your homework, changing the answers to wrong ones and then complaining that they got questions wrong because you wouldn't review their assignment? 
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:39:05
There is still a ton of optimizing to do before bitcoin can handle larger blocks without sacrificing mining and node centralization. It's always a trade off, and Core devs side heavily in favor of conservative, gradual improvement and an emphasis on decentralization.

It is impossible for a comprehensive network hardfork to happen in 3 months. That's just a stupidly fast timeline, and core wouldn't even attempt to comply with this (nor will the predominance of users). 
Miners could still go ahead and go forward with the 2x, but they will destroy value on both chains in doing so unless there is replay protection added. Since most miners sell their coins almost immediately, they'd be shooting themselves in the foot.

@_date: 2017-08-23 16:31:35
Comprehensive includes all nodes upgrading. It does not matter how many miners support it. Otherwise there will be a contentious chain split. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:18:29
I guarantee you the next soft fork that happens will not be through miner signaling. Miners will be punished for trying to wield their readiness signaling as a political tool. 
Regarding the NYA, many would argue it was the UASF that forced miners to finally do what they were supposed to. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:26:20
Except the legacy chain doesn't have any choice in the matter (they can't add replay protection without a separate hardfork, which would create 3 forks, 4 including BCH). It's only miners that lose, and users that need to move their funds. But hodlers just sit back until miners come to their senses. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:09:27

Well it needs 95% block support by November 2017. Core is going to keep building on SegWit, and I think most miners are just being a little conservative right now. It's not all doom and gloom here. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 20:21:22
Or, you know, you could just let segwit happen and allow greater capacity on the network. [But no, you make this service that forces users to sacrifice some privacy to have a normal fee] ( Not to mention, what miner wants to sacrifice profit for some nebulous political goal?

STFU and take your concern-trolling BS with you. Segwit solves malleability issues and opens the path for a lot of other scaling options down the road. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:12:16
If they roll out 2x with no replay protection both chains will be unusable. Miners can then enjoy mining all the worthless tokens they want at that point
@_date: 2016-12-13 20:18:02
You could start with a blockchain bootstrap if you really wanted to simulate a node that was more or less caught up to start with. I think this would be a pretty cool test!
@_date: 2016-12-15 07:32:55

A similar thing happened with Gox. Bitcoin doesn't rely on a bank to transfer, but cash does.

GDAX is connected to Coinbase. They have much better trading fees (BTC&lt;&gt;USD), and a maker/taker model. 
If you put in a limit buy/sell, you're a maker and you pay no fee. If you put in a market buy/sell you're a taker and you pay 0.3% (or less if you do a lot of volume). 
This is WAY better than Coinbase which is like 2% I believe
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:05:03
They added opt-in replay protection, which as I understand it requires a custom transaction that bloats the core chain and only makes the coins valid on the 2x chain. It will not be as easy as BCH where you could send your btc to another address and then load the old (now without BTC) private key into electron wallet and get your BCH.
In fact, if they press ahead with 2x it will be extremely messy and most regular users will have to avoid using bitcoin until it's resolved. There will be no way to only spend your Core coins and not 2x coins and they will not be sophisticated enough to taint their BTC with newly mined coins or create custom transactions that split.

Well it's more that Erik's line of thought is *one* reason why bcash isn't bitcoin, but not the end all be all.
Example: if 70% of mining power switched to a fork that eliminated the 21M issuance cap (saying 12.5 BTC blocks forever), the network wouldn't recognize it as valid because nodes would reject these blocks. Miners work for the hodlers, not the other way around. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 17:20:11
Example to your point: I'm a merchant that runs a node to protect my business. I receive a payment for my goods, however it's mined in a block larger than I'd like. Do I really reject that block from my node or do I accept the payment regardless of the block size?
I think we'd all agree as the merchant we'd accept any size block size.

The thing is, it really could have been. If they went with current segwit and everyone agreed that we would move towards a safe 2 mb hard fork incorporating other 'wish list' changes then I think a lot of folks would have gotten onboard. 
Instead they want a new segwit (with an arbitrary difference) which can't be rolled out until the current implementation expires, but yet also a hard fork to 2 mb in six months (!).

Erik, in all respect I think it's a little disingenuous to say bitcoin hasn't been moving forward. There have been tons of improvements put in place, many that directly affect on chain scalability:
I also think it's a little offensive to suggest I'm not a genuine bitcoiner if I fail to see the impetus to rush through a 2mb hard fork immediately. We've seen from initial BTC1 issues raised by outside developers the sillyness of moving fast and breaking things in a currency system meant to hold the value of $40B. 
Side note, you don't actually believe this would all be behind us if there's a 2mb hard fork do you? We're eventually going to have to address the topic again; hard forking now just kicks the can down the road while risking a network split. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:50:06
Long term we will likely need larger blocks. But there's time to work on a more meaningful hard fork that fixes issues that can only be resolved with a HF. There's absolutely no reason to rush this when we've already got 2mb block sizes coming online in the near future.

@_date: 2017-07-22 14:23:45
Just because it's been debated doesn't mean code is up to snuff for an almost $50B network.  There has been practically no review of BTC1 and the predominance of nodes are operating software that will throw out any blocks mined using hard fork SegWit2x software. And they think that's going to change in 3 months?
SegWit was intended to be the compromise. It offers a lot of performance improvements for nodes that help offset the centralization pressure, and it creates a new type of node opportunity with slightly worse security by not storing signature data. So even if you can only handle 1mb on your node there's now a new option that only uses the base 1mb.

Erik, as someone who holds a tremendous amount of personal respect for you (your passionate speech about Bitcoin was one of the things that got me excited about it in 2013) I must say I think you're coming out on the wrong side of this hard fork issue. 
To activate SegWit, SegWit2x is fine because it is compatible with existing core nodes, and allows miners to save some face after a very brutal public debate by avoiding a BIP 148-led activation. 
But there are terrifying implications when the expectation is users run the SegWit2x code as the reference client. Garzik and team insultingly put as the version name 'Satoshi 1.14.1', a completely unnessary dig at the work the existing 100+ volunteers have put into improving this protocol with Core. For someone advocating for social solutions, this is a completely unnessarily inflammatory approach when they could have just called it 'SegWit2x 0.14.1'. To me it suggests these developers feel they've built the new reference client, a coup putting Garzik at the head of development going forward. 
But at the root of my extreme concern is this SegWit2x software puts forward a stupidly fast hard fork start date *only three months* after SegWit is implemented by signaling bit 4. If we assume activation on/before August 1 that means users have until November 1st to review and run this rushed code. How could this not be perceived as an attempted coup, as there is no conceivable way a HF that quick reaches consensus amongst Core developers to be included in the current reference client? It's like holding a gun to the head of users and saying 'you better run this or else these bitcoin businesses and miners are going to leave you on the old chain'. 
I can tell clearly that you've begun to be more excited by other cyrptocurrencies based on the wording of your blog post, noting they are improving at a faster rate than bitcoin in your opinion and Bitcoin is going to be left in the dust. But the thing is, alts are always going to be at the front lines by aggressively pursuing changes, since they require it to have any hope at becoming mainstream in Bitcoin's shadow. Vs with Bitcoin, the focus has to be much more conservative to ensure this $40B in value isn't inadvertently put at risk through a rushed change. 
Why not put a placeholder hard fork at 2-3 years out from now, allowing users time to upgrade for a chain split and the community time to come up with a more lasting hard fork decision that cleans up parts of the protocol and addresses the block size in a more meaningful way than just kicking the can down the road? 
My hope above all hope is people come to their senses after SegWit activates and realize a hard fork so soon is in fact crazy, but hopefully you understand why someone like myself thinks you're on the wrong side of this. SegWit already provides an on chain capacity increase, so there's really no need to rush a hard fork through so soon immediately afterwards.   
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:07:50

There were two other comments after his that were removed because they were discussing more the feasibility of that suggestion. But from a technical perspective, it's not a bad idea for miners to consider just running BIP 148 if it gets down to the wire.

...it's exactly the same. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:11:35
Timing is very key though. A hard fork should be studied extensively before deployment, and then it should probably go into effect based on block height 1-2+ years later so there is more than enough time for users to upgrade and avoid a network split. 
This idea of implementing a block size increase 3 months after segwit is just dumb and reckless.

@_date: 2017-07-04 14:27:28
There are other considerations beyond node cost with larger blocks. For example, the further incentive they create for miner centralization. 
If I'm a large miner with 30% hashing power in my pool, around 30% of the time I'm mining off my own newly discovered blocks. So about 30% of the time, I don't need to download and validate the most recently released block, so have an advantage over other miners that do have to do this. The degree of that advantage is dependent on how long it takes to download and verify blocks, of which block size is an important variable. 
Granted, miners could just *assume* recently released blocks are valid when they start mining on a new block, but that's invalidating a key function they are supposed to play in the network and not behavior we should be encouraging.

Not a safe assumption to make given SegWit will have recently gone into effect; even right now they'd need to hang onto a block until tx built up or fabricate tx.

A strict base blocksize increase (ignoring for the moment SegWit already *is* a blocksize increase to 2mb) is a cost entirely shouldered by independent node operators. Businesses like Coinbase get higher tx throughput, so they don't care if their nodes are more expensive to operate and miners get absolutely more fees. 
The 2x part then takes the effective block size to 4mb, 4x what nodes have to digest now. We already have a limited number of nodes, and Bitcoin's most valuable property is its decentralized, censorship resistant and fungible digital gold. Why risk some of that for a recklessly fast hard fork increase? 
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:56:01

The thing is, ETH was the hardforked version and ETC was the original chain. So status quo in that case (don't update software for roll back) turned into ETC. 
BCC is the hard fork in this case, so since the powers of default favor BTC it is very unlikely in my mind that BCC will approximate the relative success ETC experienced.

The vast majority of the network didn't sign the NYA agreement. And in reality, even those that signed are free to change their mind based on how things evolve. A system that relies on people doing what's 'morally' right (in your opinion) is a very fragile system upon which to base a currency. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:59:57


To my knowledge, there was never any credible technical argument against SegWit. When the idea first came out everyone on both sides of the block size debate said 'that's a good idea'. 
Now a blocksize increase on the other hand has distinct tradeoffs. The cost of a block size increase is born out by users operating full nodes, not businesses (who can largely offset this cost through better tx throughput) and certainly not miners, who would expect to earn more absolute fees. 
Where the SegWit signaling for miners was intended to be a formality, they instead looked to use it as a bargaining chip to get something they wanted, which as noted above has some clear winners (tx throughput, absolute miner fees) and losers (full node operation cost, and arguably further miner centralization pressure). In a system whose major selling point is that it's essentially censorship resistant, decentralized, digital gold, making node operation more expensive isn't necessarily worthwhile even if it increases tx throughput to the extent it puts decentralization more at risk (and many would argue node count is already quite low). 
Regarding what is or is not 'rushed' for a hard fork, I think investment timelines come into consideration. As an individual investor I care about how much bitcoin is worth/used ten+ years from now, not next year. If you're a miner or a startup, you're concerned about lasting through the next year (or mining equipment ROI before it's effectively a paper weight) so there's inherently a bias towards taking risks with decentralization, censorship resistance and fungibility if it has a chance to increase tx throughput within your investment timeline.
We all want to see tx throughput increase, especially if it doesn't result in higher node operating costs. Segwit was seen as a compromise because it *is* a block size increase, but through other improvements isn't that big of a burden on full nodes. That it became hostage in this debate is unfortunate. 


Why should I care if a bunch of speculators bid up the price of Ethereum to where its market cap is relatively close to bitcoin's? In the short term markets are a voting machine, in the long-term a weighing machine. 
Ethereum is going to have substantive scaling issues down the road; their blockchain is already dramatically bigger than Bitcoin's. And why on earth would I invest in something for which supply is not capped like bitcoin's? 
In short, while I respect your perspective running ShapeShift, I've also seen how incredibly irrational investors can be (dotcom bubble, mortgage backed securities), but in the end fundamentals always win out. 


Frustration cuts both ways; you'll note that BIP 148 is not baked into Core because it's contentious and does not have consensus. As a user, it's one of the few ways left to express a viewpoint when there's a perception that miners have held a valuable protocol improvement hostage for the sake of their own interests.
I think there will be appetite for a block size increase once the network digests SegWit. If done appropriately, I hope it will also be more meaningful than a 1mb increase in the base block size 3 months from now and bring with it other meaningful improvements that can only be done through a hard fork. 
If it takes 2-3 years for a meaningful hard fork to come about, so be it. There's plenty of other improvements to work on (e.g., Schnorr signatures) that boost tx throughput without increasing node cost or changing the block size. There's also nothing to say a better idea won't pop up anyways; no one in 2013 was talking about SegWit and yet here we are.

Yeah that was pretty transparent, otherwise there really wasn't any benefit to not signal bit 1. If they were running the BTC1 software they had to manually turn off bit 1 signaling, so there had to be a reason to do that extra work. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:18:42
I believe the agreement timeline was July 21st for signaling, though I think most are doubtful that they can have everything coded and tested by then (and that people will be comfortable running that software).

Sounds good, thanks Theymos!

Are you serious? They're just supposed to sit on solved blocks and wait for the mempool to fill up? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:31:06
This is a fork being orchestrated by some miners in conjunction with some businesses. You're telling me bitmain doesn't have unprofitable old miners lying around that they could point at their own test net? What a joke.

This is about GPU mining, which is only relevant to altcoins
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:53:22
This is misleading. This figure includes all traded altcoins, most of which only trade against bitcoin so dollar values are extrapolated from bitcoin's trading price. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:58:34
It sure seems that way. Good riddance to a dumb idea and implementation.

How come you didn't link your original review? Feels biased to just show their response with no context
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:38:29
Key distinction, BIP 148 concerns the activation of a soft fork (I.e., backwards compatible) upgrade (segwit) that's already been tested and merged into Core. 
So I think BIP 148 and a controversial hard fork that will 100% fork the chain are very different.

Bitcoin *can* become a great day-to-day transactional currency with low fees and instant confirmations by allowing the development of 2nd layer scaling (e.g., Lightning), which is already well under way but relies on SegWit to be implemented. 
At the settlement layer of the protocol, what we have today, there will always be a tremendous amount of inefficiency associated with regular purchases. Who wants to pay that much in fees? Who wants to wait 10 minutes for their transaction to confirm when they're buying coffee? 
Bitcoin has the possibility to do so much more after we enable SegWit.

Hopefully it's alright with you that I [shared your comment]( You clearly put a lot of thought into that answer.  
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:35:47
How is this a non-event? The hard fork chain hasn't mined a block in 24 hours, when supposedly they had 80% miners needed to activate the fork in the first place. Something has gone horribly wrong here. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:29:32
Where are those percentages coming from?

Got to love Roger Ver's comment on the article:


And that's all he wrote. No rebuttal or evidence to the contrary, just that.

Why do you feel compelled to convince them? The harder you strain the more it looks like you're trying to sell them something. All you can do is plant the seed, and if they're not interested then move on to other topics of conversation. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:03:39
This was a pretty sloppily written and argued article. It's littered with grammatical and spelling issues and the overall argument is not presented in a very compelling manner. 


Argument is being shot in the foot here. If the author was trying to say BMW and Apple have different capital structures and thus market capitalization is not a proxy for total value, then I guess I understand. But as written the author is comparing two like things (the market value of equity in BMW and Apple) with no explanation of how this proves their point. 


Because Ethereum is pretty much just speculators and developers, Ethereum is probably more like the 1:10 example and Bitcoin more like the 1:100 example because there are day to day users that just run SPV wallets. So you're essentially saying Ethereum has a more healthy node count, which does not support your argument in any way. 
These were the two most direct examples where I went 'huh?' while reading the article. The inflation section was ok though.

Not worth your time frankly. If they're genuinely curious feel free, but it's never worth selling it since that will make you look like you're hawking something. Bitcoin sells itself.

I. E. he never explicitly said 'hey guys I did this for x reason', but it was transparent from his posts that this served a purpose, and those interacting with him at the time understood it to be a DoS prevention. 
In the early days Satoshi made a lot of changes without publicly explaining them. That doesn't mean he did not intend them as specific fixes to issues he saw at the time.

They had to manually change the config file to mine a block &gt;1mb. The fact it wasn't slated to happen automatically at the landmark block is alarming.

That's a bit of a circular reference though right? How else can an economic consensus emerge if people aren't running UASF if that's what they want?

Most of that volume was fluff because there were no trading fees. The huge fall in trade volume coincided with the PBOC requiring trading fees. One could make the argument that actual buy/sell volume remained constant or actually increased, but was masked by the reduction in bot trading.

You mean implement SegWit?  My understanding is that breaks ASICBoost   
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:14:15
My new favorite is that segwit must be resisted since it's an attempt at getting unlimited inflation through sidechains...

Core refuses to do so because there are plenty of other ways to improve tx throughput and scaling before we touch the block size. It is still incredibly controversial and practically destined to be unsuccessful under SegWit2x 
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:06:56
At least not right now. 2nd layer scaling like Lightning can change that, while still preserving decentralization and store of value at the base protocol layer. 
We just need SegWit... 
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:55:58
A) it is happening, there are multiple teams testing compatible applications on testnet
B) before it moves to mainnet, we have to fix transaction malleability which SegWit does (among many other things)

The DAO hack in Ethereum is a pretty good example of the difference between the two: 
If you're hard forking to prevent losses to a set of users then your blockchain isn't immutable, thus destroying a key value proposition from cyrptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:13:15
Interesting! Yes I would agree, tx fees should be considered part of the block reward for pool miners, that's pretty deceptive.
