12.5 BTC was just never created, there's now 21M BTC less something like 112.50000001 BTC which never got created (two duplicate blocks, this rootstock block, and one which underpaid by 1 satoshi).

It's meant to be a rootstock commitment, but whoever mined it didn't add the output which pays the reward to themselves, at a cost of about a quarter of a million dollars. Someone didn't test their software before using it with real world money, which is pretty ludicrous.

Would you look at that, it does verify. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:06:54
Absolutely. If you remove decentralisation, Bitcoin is potentially one of the worst payment methods you can imagine. A centralised, or federated system would be nearly instant, can accept a vastly larger transaction volume, and can potentially be almost completely private. Bitcoin has a cost due to decentralisation, it's easy to forget that significantly trade offs are being made to allow it to happen. 
A flood network encompassing all transaction volume for millions of people is obviously not something which can exist, even just from a raw bandwidth and validation perspective. That's a simple reality that needs to be accepted. Bitcoin is not Paypal, and can not be. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:44:22
No, my explanation was as to why. Fees can always be refunded out of band by miners back to the people that paid them. Any system which attempts to enforce a minimum can be trivially bypassed. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:02:14


It's literally doubling. 


You can't really assert that. The quadratic hashing issue in Bitcoin means a 2MB block could take days to verify, as the increase in hashing time is quadratic, not linear. The only way around that would be to put a hard cap on transaction size, or block size.

Bitcoin Unlimited basically has a situation where miners think they have control, and will go off on their own forks of the network. Everybody running non-modified nodes (this is most of the network, most services, etc) will reject these wilfully invalid blocks and move on with their chain without flinching. Miners do not have control of the network, this is not a property of Bitcoin, or in fact any alt coin clone of Bitcoin.

It's significantly easier to write connecting software in the segwit world, features like committing to output amounts vastly reduces the amount of data you need to safely work with transactions. In the case of hardware wallets Segwit instantly takes the dependent data from (transaction) + (all transactions the transaction references) to just (transaction). Absent this, hardware wallets are faced with being glacially slow or completely skipping some security validation.

The mining network is burning gigawatts of power. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:12:47
A lot of the simple realities remain. ECDSA validation is extremely slow, CPUs have not really gained any measurable speed up since 2011 or even earlier. Even more unfortunately, compact blocks and relay networks only operate in a benevolent network. They actually amplify some attacks if you are so inclined, due to them only operating in ideal caching conditions and when miners are doing things expected. 
The 30 second validation block for example is something which demolishes network validation and propagation speed. This is still not fixed without segwit and other changes, it's completely possible to gum up the network today by abusing `SIGHASH_ALL` implementation flaws. It's not as bad as it used to be, but these problems aren't exactly behind us. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:05:27


Calm your farm, the 'bit nodes' site is at most just interesting numbers and has nothing to do with the security of the network. It lists only nodes which have open sockets, and haven't banned the 21.co owned crawler which makes abusive connections in order to collect statistics. 


This is displayed by the `NODE_NETWORK` flag in the p2p services field. 
There's 293 nodes they list which have pruning enabled, and subsequently do not show `NODE_NETWORK` as a result. This isn't a significant number of the total number of listening sockets, under 10%. Even if it was, Bitcoin Core has logic to detect pruning nodes and not attempt to download from them. The DNS seeds now have the ability to filter based on services, so if you're having trouble bootstrapping you can ask for just results for peers which have your needed feature, be it `NODE_BLOOM` for SPV wallets, or `NODE_NETWORK` for people who need historical blocks. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 12:32:14
For a centralised service you can say the maximum counterparty risk is $10, and nobody would even consider this to be a significant problem. The reality is that micro payments are a considerable hassle for amounts of money that people don't even consider into mental calculations. The often presented arguments, say it's 5c in Bitcoin to join a chat channel, the value of the currency is almost always going to be below the effort of having to go open a wallet, send the money, etc. People have tipped me on reddit using change tip, or bitcointip in the past, and it's never been worth my time to go collect the penny shavings tossed in my direction.

I can buy tens of petahash from nicehash.com right now with zero hardware cost, and this sort of thing is available on a bigger scale privately if you want it. The assertion that miners will not act against themselves falls to the other design requirements of Bitcoin. You can also steal hash rate with BGP hijacking, stealing servers, or redirecting internet traffic. Trusting miners is a terrible idea, which is why Bitcoin doesn't do that.

@_date: 2017-02-03 07:53:40


This effectively can't exist. Imagine the network mandates that every transaction pay 1BTC in fees, I can now make a service that takes your 1BTC fee, takes a cut, and returns the remainder to you. Any system in Bitcoin which forces a particular fee rate, or attempts to force number of transactions per block completely breaks down due to the simple property that the miner receives the fee in the end.

@_date: 2017-02-03 07:55:28


Not significantly, and this has no impact on the network encoded size. The protocol rules could mandate 10MB of zero padding in every transaction, it doesn't mean you have to transmit the transaction that way on the p2p wire. The only reason the transaction format and the p2p format match each other today is just for convenience. Indeed, compact block transmission already completely munges up the blocks to make them easier to transmit, which has no bearing on the format that they are processed in. 


This is how all soft forks work, and is not a significant risk. When you claim that segwit as a hard fork is desirable, you're talking about a couple of bytes change in total, which requires every single piece of software in the network to be simultaneously upgraded! This is implausible to the point of utter insanity, every piece of wallet software will continue to work (given that it's open source and no centralised things go away), a hard fork potentially makes all of them incompatible. In a the soft fork segwit world, old wallet software works exactly as intended, indefinitely.

Businesses could be contributing to these issues if they desired, there's been some effort towards implementing payment channels (remember, these have existed since 2009, but nobody has made a system using them!), but not nearly as much as you would think given all of the clamouring about the end of the network due to a lack of block size increase.

It's very high bandwidth to do shuffling on the full transaction set, so it would have to be in private farms only if people are doing that version. Overt version is the same bandwidth to the miner as normal mining.

@_date: 2017-04-07 11:51:20
It confirms what we already knew, that their ASICs support both forms of covert and overt ASICBOOST. The new information is that you can enable overt ASICBOOST on production hardware for power savings yourself today, and that all the supporting infrastructure exists for people to do that right now. Best question to be asking is why wasn't this advertised as a feature and enabled by default? If you were using the covert version it would compete against you of course, so you shouldn't mention it. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:15:35

Don't think that was originally accused, just that their ASIC supports covert ASICBOOST, which it definitely does. My post here, and the post by BitmainTech confirms that it does! The fact that it definitely does support *overt* mode but it hasn't been used or advertised as a feature highly suggests that the *covert* one is in active use. Why compete against yourself? 
It's reasonable to write your own covert miner to run on the S9/S7/R4 hardware to make use of *covert* ASICBOOST, even if Bitmain haven't done it themselves. All the hardware is there, there's a fat FPGA to work grind on, the messages are all laid out in structs in bmminer. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:33:05


Eliminating covert ASICBOOST isn't a hard fork, or a proof of work change, and it doesn't stop anything but the covert form of it which blocks protocol improvements like segwit. The overt form is literally in the software already, I've enabled it on my own miners. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:34:20

You need to do 32 bits of work to find a 64 bit collision. That's deceptively little. For ASICBOOST you only need a very small partial collision. 
There's even a tool to do massive collisions using this property on bitcoin addresses. 
    shared = 20chars
    hash160[1] = 53e1f4f491509f9012bd901be5147447f770018b
    hash160[2] = 53e1f4f491509f9012bd825ce1e9599b253188ef
    shared = 15chars
    addr[1] = 18eXmgR5Svoqqa6PaYVrKvbH6hvrp5xe3A
    addr[2] = 18eXmgR5Svoqqa6JXSMmbNaD4Cs5ThcV1P
That's a 80 bit collision, doing only 40 bits of work. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:35:34
That's right. There's an interface for sending a list of mid states to the FPGA, it's in the public code on github that you can look at. You ideally want to get 4 of them colliding, but it works just fine with 2 (but lower efficiency). Doesn't matter how they're made from the perspective of the ASIC, that's just software. Good search strings are "VIL" and "multi_version". 
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:34:41
There's many ways of doing it, you don't need to get many variations, something like 65k on average. Flipping the order works, but replacing the last few transactions a few thousand times does too, as does a host of other things. That's the beauty of a collision, you need deceptively little work to find one. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:25:47
Pretty weird to have antpool.com allowing stratum commands for doing overt ASICBOOST on their production servers. You can telnet to their stratum server yourself and send the following lines and you'll get evidence that there's functions on the remote server for handling the patented version of ASICBOOST. 
    SEND {"id": 0, "method": "mining.subscribe", "params": ["bmminer/2.0.0"]}
    SEND {"id": 0, "method": "mining.multi_version", "params": [2,4,6]}
    RECV {"result": null, "id": 0, "error": [20, "_stratum_mining_multi_version() takes exactly 2 positional arguments (4 given)", "Traceback (most recent call last):
  File \"/opt/eloipool-server/eloipool/stratumserver.py\", line 199, in found_terminator
    rv = getattr(self, funcname)(*rpc['params'])
TypeError: _stratum_mining_multi_version() takes exactly 2 positional arguments (4 given)
"]}
I've also got overt ASICBOOST operating on my Antminer, it needs enabling in a hidden configuration (and a pool that supports it). Open up /config/bmminer.conf and look at the last setting. 
	{
	...
	"multi-version" : "1" 
	}
To enable multi-version needs to be &gt;1, the number being how many bits of the version number you're allowing it to modify for ASICBOOST. Enabling this will cause a new field in mining.submit which includes which version number it ended up using for the share solve, the pool server needs to be able to parse that and be able to validate it. The code for this is [on github in the bit main account]( so don't take my word for it. 
Maybe someone like Slush will make a public pool that enables people with handicapped S7, S9, R4 hardware to use ASICBOOST today and reduce their power consumption? It's a few altered responses on the stratum server and some instructions on how to modify the configuration on your miner to enable it, and you're up and running. 
* the ASIC supports overt and covert ASICBOOST
* the FPGA in the miners sold to people supports ASICBOOST
* the software in the miners sold to people supports overt ASICBOOST but it's disabled
* antpool.com supports overt ASICBOOST messages
Never meant to be used for the good of the ecosystem, right?

multi_version is the name of the technique for overt ASICBOOST. The server needs to understand that you changed the version numbers of the header to get a collision. The patent describes this in some detail.

I sent the ASICBOOST message to a bunch of different ones like ViaBTC and F2Pool but none of them respond, it's just Antpool which does. The pool isn't currently configured to send the right type of work for you to be able to grind however, but that's just a matter of it sending the right version. With your own pool software it currently works, my miner is returning valid work that clearly is using ASICBOOST.
