If you trade it all away, nobody will ever know. But then you have an incentive to report it to claim capital losses.
If you're making money and doing it by withdrawing to a bank account, pretty much any unusual activity (including large irregular deposits or small regular deposits to your bank account) will get you flagged by your bank.
If you held, you show them your purchase receipt and they allow you to claim capital gains with a cost basis of your purchase price (i.e. you'll pay the tax on the difference between sale price and purchase price).
If you day traded (even without withdrawing your cash balance from a trading account to a bank account), you can show them your initial purchase receipt and your final sale receipt. But say you bought 1 BTC initially, turned it into 2 BTC, and sold. They'll want to see the receipts for where the extra 1 BTC came from. Good luck fudging the receipts at this point (illegal and not convincing) so you'll be forced to show them a record of all the trades. I hope you saved everything.
If you declare the capital gains without a receipt, you'll be forced to pay capital gains tax with a cost basis of $0  (i.e. you'll pay the tax on the total current price).
If for whatever reason you don't report your gains, don't have receipts, and you get found out you'll be forced to pay capital gains tax with a cost basis of zero PLUS some penalties. Not sure what the exact punishments are. Money, jail, etc.

bought back in yet?

Just an update: He said last week he sold all of his 1.12 BTC at $6019 and is waiting to buy back in.
1.12 BTC * ($6019 / $7518) = 0.8966 BTC
Say he traded ten times at a 0.25% fee:
10 * 0.25% * 1.12 = 0.028 BTC
Assume his employment income is $90,000/yr. Assume he bought in at $3000 and increased the by .12 BTC at an average price of $5000. His capital gains tax will work out to about 
($5000 - $3000) * 0.28 = $560, or the equivalent of 0.0745 BTC.
0.8966 - 0.028 - 0.0745 = 0.7941
0.7941 BTC &lt; 1.0 BTC
So far he's managed to trade away 21% of his Bitcoin or about $1550 USD.
So I guess day trading isn't working out too well.

You're right, my guesses were wrong.
If you had less BTC, you wouldn't have make $231 after a hugely risky near-perfect theoretical trade (that you missed in reality). You would have made substantially less.
If you had more BTC, how the fuck did you only make $2000 in the last three weeks?
I'm also wrong because I didn't mention taxes. Suddenly that $231 you made shrinks by almost half. You are paying short-term capital gains tax, right? (close to 50% of profits in the US). If you're not paying taxes, you need someone other than me to tell you juts how stupid you are.
Not to mention the wages you could've earned if you spent that time doing something productive.  Please just read [this article](
P.S. Oh look, just jumped from $5100 to $5450. You catch those two peaks? No? Didn't think so.

Do you have more BTC because you've put in more of your own capital along the way? 
Or do you have more BTC because you kept the same amount of capital on the line, made trades, and came out ahead after subtracting fees?

How can you be so stupid? So blind? It absolutely blows my mind that people can entirely lack self awareness and math skills. Just think critically for one fucking second.
If you could predict the top at 5850 you would have. If you could predict the fluctuations between 5750 and 5500 you would have. The reason you missed them wasn't because you got greedy, it's because YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.
You say you would have made $1000 on the drop from $5850 to $5500. Based on that, I calculate you're working with 2.85 bitcoins. Your **genius** day trading method has put you up  *almost* $2000 in the last two weeks.
But if you had held your 2.85 bitcoin for the last three weeks (Sept 27th to Oct 18) you would have made $3698. Great job, you managed to throw half of your profits down the toilet.
I bet you haven't even subtracted trading fees. Let's say you correctly predicted ONE peak ($5750) and ONE bottom ($5500) which, by your own words, you failed to do 4-5 times this week. You would have lost $160 of the $700 on fees alone (23% of what you worked for). And that's only if you made two PERFECT calls. Which, just to remind you, YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DO. And every time you make a move you expose yourself to missing out on potential gains.
Say you almost called the top ($5750) and bottom ($5500) exactly, you only missed by 1% of total price on each side (still impossible). Now you would have made $231 after fees on your 2.85 bitcoin. For a total of a 1.4% total gain after fees. Great job, man.
tl;dr You will be wrong just as often as you are right, there is a huge risk of missing out on big upswings, and in the end the fees will eat you alive.
This, folks, is why you don't day trade.

*I don't know if it is really stupid or not*
“More importantly, we found that if you were to look at the past performance of these traders, only 1 percent of them could be called predictably profitable,” says a co-author, Brad M. Barber, a finance professor at the University of California, Davis. Everyone else, it seems, was on a short-term winning streak. Even those who did modestly well found their that profits were wiped out, and then some, by transaction fees like commissions and taxes.
There is an overwhelming academic consensus on day trading. You may not know if what you're doing is stupid or not, but the market does. Good luck, bud.
