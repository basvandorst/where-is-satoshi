7 cents away (my favorite Youssou N'Dour song)...
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:47:45
It's a dollar and 11 cents away from 10K right now. If only Bitcoin hadn't bought that coffee.

* Encrypt your seed with some weak encryption that's going to cost you $1000 of computing power to decrypt
* Escrow the seed with yourself
* Ask one of your grandparents to put the seed as text in their will (a bit morbid, I guess)
* Surround your seed in molten metal so it's a PITA to retrieve it
* Just use willpower

The point is that the data goes over the wire in the clear. Sniffing data and reconstructing it isn't the most practical attack, hence the clear lava block example. And of course a network-based attack needs network activity to work!
"Blocking the flow" is obviously a lot more difficult than swapping the texture of the lava block, you silly contrarian!
Don't be the person who says "ACTUALLY the time is 8:01pm, you're a minute out!". You don't make a convincing figure of authority. Focus all of your impotent rage into something constructive. I can see from your posting history that you're an angry little ball of frustration, but it's not a good look. You see yourself as a truth-seeking iconoclast, but it reads as pitiful teenage insecurity.
Message me if you want to. I would like to talk to you as a friend instead of this silliness. I think I know where your head is at.

I wonder if there's any value in enforced HODL. Travel across the world and bury your seed somewhere. Only when the coin's value is high enough will it be worth the trip to dig it up again :-D

Also (because thinking is fun!) the absolute first thing I'd do--even if my next step is going to be something as simple as redirecting the lava--is spin up Wireshark/tcpdump/whatever and dumping network traffic, so I could still access the data even if the server went offline.

Technocratic nonsense. The real world is going to fuck you.
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:29:41
You'd use terms like "attack vector" more convincingly if you'd ever actually been in the real world.
Eww, my first encounter with an incel.

I'm not supporting whatever grifter is currently claiming to be Satoshi, but the flow chart is wrong. It's very possible that the real Satoshi no longer has the keys.

Technocratic nonsense.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:35:30


Yes! That is exactly the point. tcpdump/tshark/Wireshark being a potential attack vector serves to illustrate how insecure this is. *Comprehension*. That doesn't have to form the actual attack.
It would be neat to see how blocking the lava flow works. I prefer the elegance of the invisible lava trick (which looks like it's already an existing thing, looking at other posts). Thought experiments should be fun; you're in an unhealthy place if you see them as an opportunity to try to assert dominance other other people.
Again, message me. You need a big brother.

You can't regulate crypto in a way that stops it being usable like you can with fiat. You can make it illegal for businesses to convert fiat to and from crypto or to accept it as payment, but there's not much you can do about people being able to post transactions on the blockchain.
That's the point. Transfers are no longer controlled by institutions.

If I see the QR code of the public key and it has 1BTC in there, you'd better believe I'm going to extract that private key that's out in the open.
I doubt that it's too difficult to decode the block data structures in a flat rectangle.
How long does it take to modify a Minecraft client so that lava is transparent? Custom theme?
@_date: 2019-08-25 18:45:21


Just noticed this, but: No. You need to be any user that can connect to this server as a player. Yes, that's a condition on this working, but that's also the entire point of the lava blocks being there at all.
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:45:02
Wow, imagine running being a crypto wallet business without understanding public/private keys. Quite the achievement.
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:27:09
Eehh, that private key is available to anybody with Wireshark.
Edit: Just to point out I am aware that Praesidiarius probably made this as a bit of fun and not for use in the real world. But it's fun to poke holes :-D

The best possible answer to the question "in what ways are you EXTREME TO THE MAX?!??!?" is "fresh organic home-grown produce".

Here's an issue: if there's $1,000,000 USD worth of crypto in the wallet, you'd better believe I'm buying $900,000 of cloud computing resources to crack it quickly.
I haven't run the numbers, but I think if they chose low exponents it would be vulnerable. Not all exponents are created equally...
Edit: Running some rough numbers I think it would take around ~~38~~  20 days to process the entire keyspace with an $18K per month AWS p3.16xlarge instance, so not worth it for the $1000!
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:48:33
Is the algorithm that Trezor uses to map from phrases to words documented? Does the generation algorithm limit the keyspace at all, in order to achieve the mapping?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:47:24
Okay, but let me refer you back to the question I asked:


@_date: 2017-05-24 19:34:09
I definitely am going to have multiple storage methods. I won't be printing anything, but a USB stick is definitely happening. 
I'm interested in physical, manual methods though. I've got digital covered. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:29:29
Thanks! That's exactly what I needed.
