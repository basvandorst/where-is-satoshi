I hope the price keeps falling, I really do. I'm still a long-hauler.
But, there is a dark side to a price drop, it is actually one of Bitcoin's existential threats. 
If enough miners stop b/c of diminished profits, blocks could end up taking so long to resolve as to halt the network.

I imagine he wants the story to be about Bitcoin, not the creator. Sure his pseudonymous status creates a layer of mystery and fear for some, but the rest of us have moved on. If we were presented with a new currency and the creator was constantly in the limelight, imo it would be disruptive.

all i want is to dispel the rumor that a satoshi will end up being too valuable to be useful. I'm just trying to contribute to the community. I don't understand why you are so absurdly clinging to my word choice. Had I known it would cause so much friction, I would have worded it differently, my bad. Is your mind so narrow as to not see past a single word?
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:31:51
the other idea i've seen floating around is to buy some e giftcards (amazon codes, for example) and offer them on bitmit. Once the BTC has cleared, email the code. Might take a while if you want to trade for 200-250 though

wikipedia will explain what they are better than me. but an illegal prime is a prime number that is illegal to possess or distribute.

well . . . there is an insane risk profile involved. You can look up their dividend payout history, and the two "assets" I have followed have posted regular and mostly consistent dividends. But, you have to trust that the parent company (in this case asic-miner) will stick around, then you have to trust that the issuer of the pass-through doesn't abscond with your money and finally you have to trust the exchange will stick around.
There are failsafes built in along the way, but that is still a lot of trust with a lot of room for error!
So, looking at the dividend, ask yourself if it is worth the potential risk.
I wanted to buy asicminer-pt shares when they were around .75 BTC, but I waited too long and now I feel the price is far too high.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:45:55
And bitcoin already has a value other people judge it by, currently &gt;$200 USD. So yes, someone will climb everest, but we can assume a lot less people will try and buy that gold for $5 than if they didn't have to climb everest. So the cost in difficulty of procuring bitcoin is built into its market price, such that increased difficulty = lower market price.
If, by magic, everybody who wanted to buy bitcoin had to stand on their head for one entire day before they could, then demand for bitcoin at all prices will fall. This is how "supply and demand" works.
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:36:35
would you be willing to post this to @_date: 2013-04-10 03:07:02
Because I am not a speculator and I believe in the long term value. If the price falls, maybe it will go back up in the future and then purchasing on a set schedule through a downswing would give me added utility in the future. If the price falls AND it stays down, then my previous purchases in Bitcoin can be considered sunk costs, at which point I would only stop using Bitcoin if its ability to meet the required functions is also gone.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:48:19

@_date: 2013-04-14 00:48:36
Actually, that's where it gets interesting. Let's say a satoshi ***does*** become too valuable to be useful, e.g. even one satoshi is too much money to buy a cheap widget, then we could just break them up further. The current system only allows 100,000,000 equal divisions of 1 BTC, but it is possible that in the future that will change.
So, 21 million is a hard limit for BTC, but there is no limit to how many times a Bitcoin can ultimately be divided infinitely.

It's not about the price going up, but just keeping it from being wildly volatile and disrupting the community. Bitcoin will become more and more useful as it becomes easier to spend. So I believe, pure-speculators can and will become convinced to just spend it instead of converting back to their currency. The only question is, will this happen before a mass exodus.

Sure. I'm just not investing to make gains in the short-term (ride the price up.) I am investing because I feel I will be better off in the long run regardless of what the price does in the next little while. I will only be depressed if Bitcoin completely fails, which I do not believe will happen.

I think there are people out there that would want to be paid in Bitcoin. I don't see lots large companies switching over because of the hassle of dealing with an additional payroll service. But I think employees at small businesses might be able to convince them to use a service like this.
But yes, taxes would be the big issue. And then automation i.e. the software takes care of it every pay period without the business owner having to set up a payment each time.

Any help is appreciated. I'm planning on creating a bitcoinstarter.com (like kickstarter but with Bitcoin) project soon.
I just hope more people are willing to support and realize it will just benefit them and anyone else in the Bitcoin community, because if we want to keep the currency stable we need more adopters.

What ever happens to m2 in the future is irrelevant. For any close comparison, look at it this way:
For one satoshi to buy the equivalent of what 1 cent buys today, a Bitcoin would have to have the same buying power as $10 million worth of today's dollars.
Obviously buying power will change in the future, likely as a result of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin revolutionizes the global economy the way I think it will, the buying power of a Satoshi will increase, ceteris paribus. So at that point the comparison breaks down, but this is a simple way to think about it.

The real challenge for a developer of this would be taxes in that:

@_date: 2013-04-08 22:51:14
I imagine it would work like this: the business sets up an automatic transaction to happen for each pay period for the amount the employee is getting paid in Bitcoin. The service gets the money and then automatically buys Bitcoin on the open market and then transfers it to the employees wallet. Kind of like the opposite of what bitpay does.
For it to work, the fees would need to be less than whatever payroll software costs now. In which case employers might encourage this.

if he owned the machine he could not launder his own money, b/c he would have to restock the machine w/ bitcoin which defeats the purpose of anonymously buying BTC for cash . . .
And no one could use this machine like that. Cash is already fairly untraceable. It's just hard to spend a lot of it. If you're a drug lord, you have oodles of cash. As soon as you spend the oodles that seemingly came out of nowhere it is suspicious. The goal of money laundering is to make the cash appear like it came from legitimate sources, such as funneling it through a dry cleaning business and cooking the books.
I took the time to craft this response b/c I am bothered by people, such as yourself in this instance, that automatically associate BTC w/ money laundering.

I imagine the burden of proof would be on the government to say that an owner of one of these machines is operating as an unlicensed msb. If you only allow less than $1000 worth of BTC to be added to any given address per day, it might be enough to skirt licensing. But I'm just thinking aloud.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:05:53
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:39:28
no, because hypothetically a new digital currency could come along and supplant BTC, causing said failure. But, Bitcoin has the largest user base, is actually useful for buying things, has a dedicated developer community and an official organization that is the steward of the source code (the Bitcoin Foundation).
So. . . Bitcoin will get better with time, and it will be costly for Bitcoin users to switch over to an upstart. But will Bitcoin rise to these challenges? No one knows for sure. Except maybe Nakomoto ;)

This is such a fallacy. There will always be a relationship between BTC/USD (or whatever) price. **What we need is a stable exchange rate.**
Imagine a business starts selling a widget today at 1 BTC. then in a while a Bitcoin starts exchanging for a much higher amount of USD.
Would you, assuming you are a rational actor, buy something for the fixed price of 1 BTC when you could buy it somewhere else for cheaper in some other currency?

This scares me, because I feel some people will see all digital currencies as the same therefore think ripple is as strong as bitcoin. Bitcoin (the technology) has the best fundamentals. And the technology itself is not a for profit operation, unlike opencoin. If anything sounds like a scam, it's a currency whose controllers are openly out to turn a profit.

The only one of those that makes sense is point number four. Sellers holding out for a higher price will raise the price if demand is up. But the relative lack of ease is a cost that a buyer of bitcoin has to factor in. All other things being equal, bitcoin was easier to buy (not $ price, but difficulty of executing a purchase) and if there were no scams or bad press, the price would be even higher.
You just said a bunch of things that are actually driving the price down.
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:53:36
Thanks. The problem is that people see bitcoin's value continue to go up. I do to. But I feel that people then assign an abitrary future value that hits their imagination just right. "If I buy a single bitcoin today, someday I will be a millionaire." Until you stop and multiply 1 million by 21 million. The number is huge.
