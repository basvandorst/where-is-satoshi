Thank you for the reply! I had a look at localbitcoins but their prices seem marginally higher than the market price which is what initially put me off.

Thanks for the reply and yeah I intend to do the same, if there's one thing I've learnt from this subreddit it's that I should move BTC out of exchanges as soon as I've bought it.

Thanks for the reply and welcome, I think I'll go with coinbase then - everything I read seems to be positive.

Coinbase it is then, thanks for the reply!

Oh okay, that could be a better option actually - I'll look in to it more thoroughly tonight. Thanks again.

Thanks for the reply. I didn't mean any offense when questioning your legitimacy, I was just curious as there does seem to have been an influx of Bitcoin related scams etc. recently and I didn't want to fall foul to one. I think that services like the one you provide will be crucial to the future of Bitcoin and it's continued validity as a currency.

Thanks a lot for the information. Ah the joys of account fees! Having looked at their available packages I don't think the fees are that unreasonable, as you said, akin to that of a bank. Yeah that was my understanding of how the debit card will work (for the foreseeable future at least) but I still think it's a great way to promote Bitcoin in everyday legitimate use. Thanks again!

Cloudflare did not mitigate the attack. Even though I love cloudflare their blog post was misleading and really designed to big themselves up - they had very little to do with the mitigation of the attack. Obviously when the attack started they would have mitigated the attack on their network level using their anycast system to spread the load but in reality when the attack got bigger they could do nothing. The ~300Gb attack that has been posted about endless times was actually a direct attack on the London and Amsterdam (iirc) IX's. Basically huge exchanges.
The main IX's were responsible for mitigating the attack, though, no mitigation was really needed as these IX's handle day to day traffic of ~1.5Tb/s so an extra 300Gb/s isn't really going to ring too many alarm bells. I would also like to point out that cloudflare sites were also inaccessible from England and parts of Holland during the majority of this attack due to cloudflare's IP's being nullrouted by the IX's.
edit: I would also like to add that these posts about how it nearly 'killed the internet' owtte are complete bullshit.

One option is to use the Coinbase API. The docs are located here:
