Can you ELI5? and which white paper?

"For long term it doesn't really matter if there are millions of gpu mining BTC or just a few hundreds." Agree, the problem is not the hashpower per se. 
But the way mining works right now create a system where there are only a few big miners. And this is not good, because they can collude and decide what chain to mine and what chain to leave behind. 
For now BTC has a slow difficulty adjustment algorithm, so the chain could be stuck for weeks or months if most of the big miners were to mine another chain.
For me it's a problem, but I might be missing something?
Regarding fees, I don't see it as a big issue because lots of proposals are being implemented to improve this.
But the influence of the miners is concerning I think.

Is that what they call the 'death spiral'? And what is the solution to this issue? I'm pretty sure I'm missing something here, otherwise people would talk more about it. I can't believe everyone just assume that BTC cannot be subject to this scenario...
I agree otherwise, if they leave slowly it's not a big deal, the difficulty will adjust slowly as well. So it's not a problem.

Agree, it's called complacency, and it is a bit worrying. But I think most BTC hodlers are not that complacent. When reading r/bitcoin or r/btc we have to remind ourselves that they are not representative of the whole ecosystem... fortunately.
I'm still hodling, will buy as well as soon as paycheck arrives... but I am cautious.

Don't tell anyone. But give money to friends, family and unknown people anyway, it feels good. Creating a new culture of responsible people that know what money is and what saving is great... but if we could add generosity in the lot it would be even better (not saying that OP is not generous! just a general comment)

Prizes in general are vain things. Often the system of selection and award is poorly designed or biased by some hidden motives. There is no need for the bitcoin community to ask for any prizes for any of the main contributors.

Upvote from me. If bitcoin can reduce a bit consumerism that's great. But seeing all the car memes these days I'm not too sure that's what will happen!
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:04:15
This. There is no fake transactions in bitcoin. The system is meant to work whatever people will do with their coins.

Thanks, and good point! I had a look at it when I started, but never delved into it... I guess I should :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:55:11
One less available, hurry up people! :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:43:45
Thank you Slush! Good to see it's not all about money sometimes.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:46:01
But I'm sure they are aware of this and are thinking of a solution... but then... what is it?! I have no idea. Trying to find some discussions about it. Anything on their mailing list maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:21:28
does it mean that BCH is now subject to such attacks since it adjusts the difficulty at each block? or did they implement some other features to avoid this issue? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:46:08
I'd be interested to know as well. 
Are there any plans for bitaddress.org to add segwit addresses? that'd be great.

At least take a side. It's not good for bitcoin to have these 2 coins. I sold all my BCH. I won't have regrets even if BTC crashes and BCH rises (which I doubt of course)
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:44:48
Indeed, I started with a free account and then did an upgrade - the bitcoin payment option was available then. Confirmation came very fast as well.

Yes, if you have control of your private keys or if you had your private keys managed by a wallet that allows claiming back your BCH. You will not lose your BTC if you don't make mistakes. There are some good online guides about how to do it. But if you ask these questions it means you don't have a good grasp of the importance of private keys and how bitcoins are owned and moved around. Try to read as much as possible on the subject, it will help you a lot in the coming months!

Agree as well, looking for some opportunities to spend my btc.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:34:36
great post, thanks
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:14:52
Thanks for the link. Very interesting idea this website. I hope you'll get some traffic!
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:39:08
I've used Electron Cash to sell all my BCH... worked well
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:16:33
[Got it fixed for you!](
We're safe until 2100 at least.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:30:31
I would if I was in it just for the money, but I'm not.
@_date: 2017-09-30 09:28:05
Same here, sold all my BCH. We have to take side and put our money where our belief/mouth is.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:12:39
The flag is moving... no one will believe you!
