I can definitely understand that, my point is that even if a layman is skeptical about the claims of RaiBlocks he can immediately go download a wallet and test the claims for himself today because RaiBlocks isn’t making promises, they have a live working product now. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:09:40
The white paper is designed to be understood by most people who have a basic understanding of crypto, not just those with deep technical understanding of the underlying systems. Those who want to dive into the nuts and bolts can do so, but there’s no reason for the average person to be super skeptical about Raiblocks since they have a perfectly working product right now.

I really like the  combined symbol they had. You have to open the article to see what it looks like. 
@ = internet
$ = money
 “the internet of money” or “the money of the internet”
I’m imagining looking at restaurant menus in the future and seeing that symbol used. I can picture it. 
All the other symbols look like they are trying to treat a Satoshi as some kind of brand or something... We need something that looks like it belongs more in everyday commerce rather than something that looks good on a T-Shirt or as a company logo.

That’s a dumb question. They don’t get to keep the money from the fees, that’s why.

The insecurity of this sub makes me think that bitcoin cash might actually be better than regular bitcoin. If bitcoin cash was nothing but an inferior scam coin then we wouldn’t hear much about it and this sub would talk about it 24/7
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:56:23
No, that would disincentize people to work. The “U” in UBI stands for universal, which means everyone, working or not, rich or poor.

Raiblocks is coming for us all...
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:16:13
If bitcoin doesn’t fix its problems it will be an unused alt coin as well. You can’t expect people to use an inferior coin forever when there are so many better alternatives. The first mover advantage will only last so long.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:18:44
Why not increase the block size as technology advances? Computers can hold 10x as much as they could when bitcoin was created and are much faster and cheaper. 1MB is so arbitrary, and bitcoin was never meant to stay at 1MB forever, so when is the correct time to upgrade?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:59:24
Nothing. This sub is acting like a bunch of spoiled children.

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:26:12
I never claimed that people were using it as a currency. Coinbase is literally the number one downloaded app right now. They are adding millions of new accounts a week. What is your definition of mass adoption if that isn’t it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:22:15
I think you just proved his point
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:40:51
NO NO NO. Have y’all lost your minds? Smaller block sizes??? Higher fees??? Do you also want to get rid of Segwit, which is essentially a block size increase? I understand why you think these would be good things but you forget how much competition there is in the crypto world, this is just going to drive people to other cryptos. Bitcoin will eventually lose its  spot if we continue like this and try to convince ourselves that it’s OK.
You CAN slowly scale on chain to keep the network decentralized. A sensible combination of responsible on-chain scaling plus off chain scaling like lightning Network is what we need, and that’s why people like andreas antonopoulos support it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:23:25
I’m never said you claimed that 1mb was perfect. That’s why that sentence ends in a question mark. 
All the arguments against switching  to a larger block size also apply to just larger blocks in general, so if you don’t believe that the 1MB blocksize is ideal, then why are you against switching to a more ideal size?

Nah, it’s just pretty obvious how strong this bull market is. You might have had a good point in late 2017 when the market was overbought. But it hasn’t even reached its past ATH and has been in a brutal bear market for all of 2018. 
What you’re claiming is either that 
1. Bitcoin will not experience another parabolic bubble burst cycle in the next 18 months even though its been consolidating for the past year and has shown incredible growth lately. 
Or that
2. The next top won’t even be 150% higher than the previous one, even though the previous bubbles sent it up thousands of percents in some cases.
Both of those seem unlikely. Claiming you are 97% sure of them seems foolish.

Your not throwing anything away. If you spend and replace your stack never shrinks.
@_date: 2018-04-12 04:50:59
You are also forgetting the discounts I get when shopping with bitcoin. Most of the time I spend and replace bitcoin I use it for amazon purchases, by using purse I get a large enough discount to not only make up for any small fees I might pay, but I save money on top of that as well. So actually, it’s more like I’m getting paid to use bitcoin, the opposite of throwing money away,
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:27:01
Not true. You pay taxes on crypto to crypto trades. If you buy $1000 worth of bitcoin with $1000 then you have a gain of $0 and pay 0 in taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-12 04:43:09
Buying bitcoin with USD - No transaction fee, 0.25% exchange fee.
The 0.25% exchange fee plus the bitcoin to merchant transaction fee is still much less than the average credit card fee.
So no. Still not throwing away any money.

Do that and we will be both very very wealthy one day.

You are looking at days when you need to be looking at months. I’m a long term investor. Did you really think my time horizon was a just a few days? No one can predict short term market moves. Markets don’t move in straight lines. They have corrections. I actually expected the markets to correct higher and crypto to correct lower in the short term, so I’m actually doing much better than expected.
I’m still waiting on bitcoin to correct down to the 6000 dollar range to buy more.

I respectfully disagree. When you spend and replace you always have to buy in order to replace, which sends a buy signal to the market.
However the person or company doesn’t always convert it back to cash, meaning on average it’s more of a buy signal to the market than a sell signal. 
I have no idea where you got your 99% figure from, because it’s definitely incorrect. In fact most of the people I’ve bought stuff from using bitcoin still have their bitcoin. So definitely more of a buy signal than a sell signal.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:53:09

No long term correlation so they can both end up higher. However sometimes during market selloffs I expect more and more that during big selloffs that bitcoin will have an opposite correlation and rise because investors are realizing that the crypto market isn’t correlated with the rest of market like you said, so they’ll use it as a hedge.

I don’t know for sure but IMO there are signs that seem to be pointing to one. We have literally been in a bull market for over a decade and are now due for a major correction.

@_date: 2019-05-14 14:47:20
I’m respectfully telling you that you are incorrect.
It is a net positive on price when you spend and replace. I have already explained why, however I think I see where your confusion is coming from so i’ll try and explain more in depth. Theoretically spend and replace is net zero on price effects. However that’s never the case in actual practice because of human behavior, which i’ll explain further down.
First of all let’s get one thing straight. There is absolutely no logical way that spend and replace can exert a net negative effect by your logic or mine. Even if the merchant sold all their bitcoin immediately the net transaction would be Zero. The transaction itself would be [Fiat &gt; Bitcoin &gt; Bitcoin &gt; Fiat] which doesn’t have a net effect on the the market at all. It’s the same net effect of simply passing a bitcoin back and forth between two people. It doesn’t and can’t effect the rest of the market because it doesn’t and can’t effect external supply or demand in any way. A simple logic test can prove this. If me and the merchant were stranded on a deserted island off the blockchain the exact same scenario could occur completely outside of the market just with IOUs. I could use one of my current bitcoins to buy something (the spend), after receiving the item I would then buy a new bitcoin to replace the one I spent (the replace). The only bitcoin available for me to buy in the closed system is the one I just traded to the merchant, causing a closed loop that can literally repeat forever without affecting the outside world at all, basically the greater market is invisible to that transaction and vis versa. Basically it’s identical financially as just two people passing a bitcoin back and forth, which I could do for a million years and still not effect the markets in any conceivable way.
Ok, so now that we’ve established that at worse this transaction is Net Zero let’s look at another situation. 
What about if the merchants keep the bitcoins instead of converting them back to fiat?
Well you mentioned negating the counterfactual buy signal. Surly you realize that it would only negate a counterfactual Buy signal if the merchant was planning on purchasing bitcoin regardless. This is not always the case in reality due to human nature. This is also easy to prove because I’ve done it myself. I’ve increase the price pressure of bitcoin buy using spend and replace. I’ll give you an example. Let’s say I have 10 bitcoins and do a spend and replace transaction with a friend for an item. I convince my friend to accept bitcoin for an item and that he should hold it as an investment. So I trade him one of my bitcoins for the item he is selling me then I go on an exchange to replace the bitcoin I traded. Now I have 10 and my friend has one. My friend was not planning to and would not have purchased bitcoin regardless. Now instead of 10 bitcoins out of the market there are 11. That’s one extra bitcoin that is now illiquid to the market and unavailable to buy. There is no reverse side of this equation also adding an extra bitcoin to the market for selling therefore the net effect in that situation is a positive one on the market, pushing prices higher.
Here is one last thought experiment for you. If spend and replace was a net negative it would be trivially easy for an organization to crash the value of bitcoin by doing continuous spend and replace transactions. They would do a large number of transactions, driving down then price, then buy those cheaper bitcoins back for a lower price to “replace” their stash and do the whole process over and over again continuously exerting a negative effect on the market. That’s not possible and that’s not how the markets work.

I’m really confused by this comment... 
I think maybe you meant to reply to someone else. 
I never mentioned hedge funds... I also never mentioned Spain. (Huh?What does Spain have to do with anything). 
I also never mentioned clients. 
Having said that during the last bull run many financial clients did want exposure to Bitcoin, did you not seen any interviews with Novogratz during that time? Do you really think people aren’t going to start getting client calls during this bull run as well? What evidence do you have for this?
Also, CNBC has been calling BTC a hedge all day while also talking about other hedges that also rose today like gold, and have even posted multiple articles about it, including ones that have been posted to this subreddit literally within the last 24 hours so claiming people with financial knowledge would laugh at bitcoin being a hedge is not only obviously wrong, but confusing because it’s easily disprovable.
Lastly, my post made no claims, so trying to disprove claims I never made is even more confusing. 
I’m not trying to be be rude, I’m sure you mean well, just try and do a little more research before making claims. And don’t try and disprove claims that were never made in the first place.
