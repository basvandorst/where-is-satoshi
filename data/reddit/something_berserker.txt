Do exchanges provide a 1099 type form for each account at year end? Are we all supposed to track this ourselves and guess how to enter it on our taxes?

It is horseshit. What else do you keep your money in? As I said, cash is also an investment. I didn't say anything about the merits of going all in on anything. Also, I agree it is a bad idea to buy a single equity, but SPY, DIA, and other market-tracking ETFs are entirely appropriate to put in money for say, a retirement account.

That is horseshit. Tell that to everyone with a retirement account. There are relatively safe, stable investments and there are risky, volatile investments. Also, I would like to point out that keeping your money in cash, is also an investment.

A little more context would be helpful to some I'm sure: When determining the value of Tesla, to take the company private Musk added 20% to the current TSLA share price and rounded up to $420, for his girlfriend as reference to marijuana. 
\&gt; "We allege that Musk had arrived at the price of $420 by assuming a 20 percent premium of what Tesla's then existing share price (was), and then rounding up to $420 because of the significance of that number in marijuana culture, and his belief that his girlfriend would be amused by it," Steven Peikin, co-director of enforcement at the SEC, said during the conference.
