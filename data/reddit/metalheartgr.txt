10 sat/b transactions are clearing right now. It's a miracle!

Tbh I kinda like their decision. From the moment I got into crypto, facebook ads about bitcoin and other altcoins got so annoying. Not to metion most of them are scam.

This will work on Electrum too, right?

@_date: 2018-09-08 12:47:20
I think Electrum lets you do that

I guess hodl doesn't apply to bitcoin only.
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:04:08
It means we'll finally see someone actually spend Bitcoin instead of HODLing.

Electrum wallet and a good password + wallet seed on paper. No need for more.

He bought? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:35:15
Considering the price is rising there's not a lot of them
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:24:51
I bought CSGO a few months back for 16$ BTC. Now they are worth more than 55$. I wish I hodl'd instead :(

Bech32 addresses are still not implemented by Coinbase so not entirely. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 09:19:18
Enormous if substantial 
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:24:41
There are already lots of shitcoins out there... 
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:24:51
I don't get why more people don't use Electrum. It's just the best software wallet out there.

He's a banker, so it makes sense if he feels threatened..

@_date: 2018-02-21 13:43:05
I thought Electrum brought Bech32 first. I might be wrong though...
