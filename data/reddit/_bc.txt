Agreed. And they probably don't have enough btc coming in each month to pay even a fraction. But when employees start getting it, we'll have a wider base. This is one big snow ball we're riding. It's getting bigger all the time.

You'd need lots of participation - to spread the risk.

The quick route to trust would require the issuer to identify himself.
Identifying yourself as an issuer of options exposes yourself to regulators coming down hard on you.

These halvings are an incredible demonstration of the power and importance of both decentralization and deflation.
Thousands of miners who will never meet each other will all agree to forsake apparent profit (what is seen). Instead they'll opt for what is not seen (profit from a deflationary policy).

I must admit I am very excited by this event. Mostly because it is an important milestone. I think there is a (shrinking) population of people who believe that bitcoin is fated to fail - either by crypto-technical-bug, or by innate flaw in its dynamics. This event should help nudge a few to re-examine their ingrained beliefs.
This First Great Halving will pass without drama, but there will be a collective exhalation from many of its fans. Most importantly, it will raise some important eyebrows. A new round of articles will be written to a slightly wider audience - deservedly. A few more flakes will adhere to a snowball that's picking up speed - and just made it over a bump that some thought it would never even reach.
This is history in the making, that was quietly laid out years ago without fanfare. Fast-forward another 210,000 blocks and I know the fanfare will multiply. Much of the world will be in the midst of a prolonged recession and increased unrest. US politicians will be falling over themselves pointing at people and countries to blame, and in the midst of another presidential election. Bitcoin will still be chugging along, with a track-record that will inspire. Millions of people will be waiting for that second Great Halving - like some comet their grand-parents had once spoke of.
Can block reward halving still increase value? Block reward halving is the reason bitcoin HAS value. That doesn't answer the question, but I think the question isn't so important. Whether the value increases a few hours/days after the halving is largely irrelevant. It's a blip compared to the rocketing roller-coaster ride that awaits.
@_date: 2012-10-04 00:50:53
This really hit me. It's a wonderful way to think about how and why money is used. I don't think I've ever heard it put this way. I think it more clearly explains what happens in an economy.
When a hoarder defers consumption (thus reducing the number of bitcoins chasing goods), others can lay a larger claim to goods on the market. Their bitcoins might be used to pay to feed workers who are building a house, or keep a research scientist happy in his work. Either of those uses could bear fruit and increase the pool of wealth that the saver may then later purchase with the bitcoins he had saved.
This tendency instills, in ALL holders of bitcoin, an instinct to save - or at the very least NOT to consume willy-nilly. Willy-nilly purchases (of nick nacks, or low-quality items, for example) reward low-value industries and punish more capital-intensive industries (think rockets or cancer cures). If there were 100 people on a desert island and many of them decided to spend their clams on nick nacks (perhaps they were made delirious by a fever, and got the notion that their clams would be worth much less over time), many hut-builders and fishermen might decide to spend more time making low-value nick nacks, and less time being productive. Maybe clams aren't the best choice for this example. Maybe arrows on an island of many wild boars - but you get the idea.

If you're right, that it's centralized, it *has* to fail. It cannot compete against hordes of lawyers and lobbyists. They have no reason to let it succeed.

1) Decentralization
2) Incentives to support

2) yes. The bitcoin network is an open ledger. Everyone agrees you received coins - even if you weren't watching (it's stored in the blockchain). The keys are in your "wallet".
3) The private keys are the key. Some people store them outside their wallet.dat file - on paper, e-wallet, etc.
4) I'm a little paranoid, and hold onto some old prior backups. It's not necessary to backup each time - unless you make a LOT of transactions in one session.
4b) old backups (more than 100 transactions old) may not have the keys and addresses to which you later received coins.
5) You don't have to worry about these things. More efficient mining is a good thing. Brute forcing a GOOD password takes centuries. If you're worried, make it a GREAT password (very random, and not short - but don't lose/forget it)
6) You could use bitaddress.org or some similar site to move your coins to an address whose private key can be re-generate from a list of words you ask your heirs to memorize (using a browser-saved copy of the site). Each heir memorizes some of the words (with overlap).

Bitcoin addresses are like containers. The blockchain is an open agreement/ledger on which containers/addresses have how many bitcoins (received from others).
A bitcoin key is hashed and manipulated to form its bitcoin address.
Private and public keys are crypto/magically intertwined:
* If a transaction is signed with a private key, it can be authenticated with the corresponding public key (verifying it was signed by the same person who controls the public key).
* A transaction signed/locked with a public key can only be unlocked with the corresponding private key (the same person who controls the public key)

When that happens, some miners give up. Since mining is a competitive process (a lottery of sorts), their departure makes mining easier for those who remain. If enough miners leave, it becomes profitable again for those who are most efficient (or lucky enough to have free/cheap electricity).

I'm thinking of capable, educated, un-rich, distant people who currently might find it difficult to reach students in the first world who are paying a lot of money to learn. A small niche might simply be tutoring services.
I'm also thinking of prominent, brilliant people with or without accreditation reaching distributed students without the formality of a university.
I'm thinking of researchers (of all kinds) who might want to spend just an hour a week, away from their work, without the hassle of getting a traditional teaching job.
I'm also thinking of a Justin Bieber of education. Someone, with something to teach, suddenly enabled to reach and teach thousands of interested people - in subjects heretofore not practical in traditional settings.

Doesn't the forced-declaration become an unexpected disaster?
A hidden hoarder, having been dormant for 99 years, now forced to show his hand, may "dump" them a year earlier - *before* the world is *entitled* to know the fate of those bitcoins he controls. Perhaps he (the great-grandson of Nakamoto) would have rather used them slowly in years 102, 103, 104, and 105. But now he fears the market reaction to his forced-declaration of control.

Miners compile transactions they've received (since the last block was found) into a new, **candidate**, block. One of these transactions actually, potentially, moves the newly-minted block reward to the miner's own address.
This candidate block also references the previous block, and it contains a random number, used just once (nonce). The miner hashes the entire block, and hopes that the hash satisfies the difficult requirement (wins the lottery by being less than a network-agreed number). If it does, he quickly broadcasts the winning block before someone else discovers one.

Bitcoin is a public ledger that can be used to keep track of who put something into it - either by physically supporting it (miners who dedicate hardware and electricity to the network can get a reward) or by helping someone who gave them bitcoins (cash, service, or product).
The ledger cannot be gamed or corrupted, and the gold stars used by the ledger are limited. They're not giving them away like candy. In fact, they're given away according to immutable rules.

A private key is just a number within a very large space. The public key that corresponds to that private key is generated by hashing it in a prescribed way.
A private key *could* also be treated as a seed for other private keys. You could add the number 50 (or any number) to that private key, and that could be a perfectly valid private key as well. If you then hashed *that* private key appropriately, you'd have a different public address. Rinse, repeat.

1 - work hard, earn money, buy bitcoins
2 - "prevent anybody else from using it *and* getting richer in the process " - those are two mutually exclusive things. They can't have it both ways. Actually, they couldn't even have the first.
**Future Scenarios:**
Bitcoin increases the monetary freedom of millions (hopefully billions) of people. An increase of freedom leads to an increase in prosperity - for millions of people (see early America). Millions of economic experiments are conducted with market information that is extremely close to the decisions being made.
Bitcoin decreases centralization of monetary power. This leads to weaker governments, less able to fund research and deployment of weapons of mass destruction (see drones, nuclear warheads, bio-warfare, worse things we haven't learned of yet).

There are lots of unknowns here. Some of the biggies are:
 * How much will a bitcoin be worth when all of the bitcoins have been mined?
 * How many transactions will be competing for a block?
 * Will we extend the bitcoin precision beyond a satoshi?
In my mind the first question is most important.
If a bitcoin is worth 100,000 loaves of bread when the block rewards cease, then a single satoshi might be a healthy transaction fee for a miner's efforts.
If a bitcoin is worth 100,000 loaves of bread when the block rewards cease, then bitcoin might be judged a success by millions, if not billions, of people - all competing to transact via the blockchain. This would be a healthy scenario for miners.
If a bitcoin is worth 100,000 loaves of bread when the block rewards cease, then extending the precision might be popular and feasible. If that happens, block rewards might continue for decades longer.

Wait. You want people to buy stocks and *hold* them? Not spend them? You want people to **hoard** stocks? Is that what you're advising?
@_date: 2013-02-03 02:20:18
This isn't the first time we've heard this argument, and you're absolutely right. But, I've never heard someone take it a step further:
So what? What if someone *wanted* or *needed* to convert a few million into bitcoins, and couldn't stand to wait a few weeks to "not have the price fluctuate". What if such a person tried to do this in a single week. If you're *that* confident in bitcoin, and you've got a good reason for doing so, maybe such an action would be a **big** kickstart to the currency.
I don't know how someone would *actually* do this, but imagine the round of press this would generate. I'm sure there would be a huge amount of speculation that would further-skyrocket the price, but perhaps the press it generated would help sustain the price afterwards *somewhat*, and not result in a *huge* paper loss for the buyer.
Just a thought experiment.

I didn't see it here, but I breezed through some of the insults, so I'm not sure.
I want to make sure you understand *why* you shouldn't import the wallet file. The reason for creating an offline wallet is: you don't trust your operating system enough to keep private keys safe.
So, even if you had imported the wallet.dat to your permanently-offline computer, it could still exist somewhere in the bowels of the untrusted computer from whence it came. To avoid this, you need to send your coins to an address whose private key has *never* been on a networked computer.
From this offline computer you can later construct and sign transactions which send coins from your "air-gapped" computer - to spend them. It's the *signed transaction* that needs to be sent to the bitcoin p2p network for coins to be transfered from one address to another.
I hope this helps.

Fine. But you're talking about a *long* time from now. $1.50 per transaction in 100 years sounds doable. And perhaps *a lot* more people will be transacting then (and we will have increased the max-transactions-per-block by then), and so the price of a transaction might only be 50¢. I'm not sure where this $1.50 came from anyway, but regardless, this sounds like a good problem to have: surviving 100+ years, revolutionizing the relationship between government and the governed, and concerned about the next 35+ years.

Coinbase is a great first choice. Once you conclude that first transaction you'll be able to purchase more very easily - each day, if desired. Your limits will increase 30 days after that, but since it's almost an entirely flat charge, there's almost no reason not to purchase small amounts periodically (if you've got the money and the intent).

@_date: 2013-01-09 04:33:25


Are you sure about this? I don't think you're correct. I don't remember how these addresses are generated, but given an address, you don't know if it was generated as the 1st address in the sequence or the 1000th. It sounds to me like you're suggesting something along the lines of "a single point defines a line".
Similarly, if you know two addresses, you can't be sure that they were consecutively-generated or thousands of generations apart.
And we're not really talking about a line anyway. This all strikes me as highly non-linear.

The 2nd  set of keys would be hidden in what would appear to be random garbage data.  **Very** cose  scrutiny  of the file ( if under legal scrutiny) could prompt  the question of what that random data is doing in the file. I could be wrong,  but,  under true crypt, a hidden volume can be mistaken for unused space.  I'm not sure the same  can be said  here. A file  should only be as long as needed *unless*  the devs specifically  allocate  space  within the file  to aid in this deniability.

There are only ~144 blocks to be found in a day. The cost of ASICs are mostly overhead. The marginal price of a single ASIC is diminutive.

The terms of your purchase *are* locked in. You bought 10btc.
I recommend withdrawing your btc as soon as possible. It's a good habit to get into - if you're capable enough.
If you *do* intend to withdraw your btc, *now* is the time to backup your wallet. That's right, *before* it contains anything. "wallet" is a bit of a misnomer. It's really a keychain of sorts. Make at least 2 backups of it, and keep them in different *locations*, encrypted.
If you feel up to it, truecrypt could be the next step in securing your wallet. Create a 200MB volume with a very long password, and save your wallet in it. Back *that* up at least twice, and keep them in different location.
Welcome to a new world where *you* control your financial destiny. If you buy into it all, I recommend treating it like an old-time savings account. Set aside money on a regular basis, and watch it grow.

I  think you're missing the concept of  proof of  work.  it sounds like your idea opens the door to bad  actors  introducing false  intermediate blocks every  2016  blocks.  without 4  years of  blockchain  to back up an  intermediate block's  claim of  validity, it  might look just as valid as a made-up block.  unless I'm misunderstanding your idea.

Maybe this happens. We can't know just yet. In the interim, a **lot** of good will have been done. Millions of eyes will have been opened. Millions. Corrupt power will weaken.
In the mean time, I think it's conceivable that AMD (and/or some competitor) could build their own asic, sell thousans, then millions of them, and bring personal ASICs (PAs) to the masses. Any ASIC producer stands to gain much more by selling (defraying the huge upfront costs) than by only mining for themselves.
Longer term, I wonder if open source ASICs will succeed and compete with the big boys. Wouldn't *that* be great!?

1) don't mine. If I told you, 20 years ago, about the word wide web, and how great it'll be, and how it'll change the world, none of that would mean you should run out, purchase a server, and start hosting a web portal. If you're at all interested in bitcoins, start by doing nothing. Think about if you want to a) use them b) save them c) learn about them d) find them.
2) there's a small chance that bitcoin is not yet easy enough for everybody - yourself included. There's no shame in that. Read 1) above. If you're still not interested, fine. But check back in in 6 months. (Most people would have said 12 years, but bitcoin is such that it's not 1 company working to improve a technology, it's a whole ecosystem.)

good randomness, and big numbers.
IF you have a good enough source of randomness, and you probably do, when all is said and done, to collide with an address your computer generated, someone else's computer would have to flip heads/tails the same way yours did - 160 times! (That's my recollection, anyways).
You're asking a good question. It's just that it's not typically easy for human brains to readily grasp large numbers - not without a good amount of thought, anyway.
Ask wolfram alpha to calculate 2^160, and then divide that by the number of seconds in a year, and then divide that by the number of humans on the planet, and then divide that by a billion, or a trillion, or a quadrillion. I'm willing to bet it's still a damn big number.

They're ideal for young, risk-taking, intelligent people of means.
But I believe even older folks should give it a glance. Anyone on a fixed income (with more than 5 years of life expectancy) is rolling the dice if that income is defined in a fiat currency.

Bitcoins are money. Whether you mined them or bought them, they're **your** money. You could buy something with them right now, or you could hold onto them. (I think you should hold onto them) But *your* money is at (short-term) risk (risk of loss in value).

harming? really?
Anemone5: It's a digital native that doesn't rely on any central authority or 3rd-party trust for its value store.
Anemone5: It cannot be controlled or inflated by any central power, and thus its value cannot be destroyed by inflation like every other currency in the world. Even gold's value could be destroyed if we one day found huge gold deposits (in asteroids maybe?).
Those are important points.
Anemone5: ...talk of a global currency war could drive users into bitcoin to escape government mismanagement of their own national currencies. I'm sure residents of Argentina, Venezuela, etc., would have loved to escape into bitcoin before their devaluations took place.
This sounds very reasonable.

It's probably not a bad idea to mention it at many places. I think we'll probably need to have a number of eventually-canned spiels:
* a 5-second one-liner (if a cashier is busy) - "an internet currency that can't be shut down"
* a 30-second version for the elevator
* 2-minute summary while waiting on line for movie tickets - before their eyes glaze over
* 4-minute version when you find a smarty that's actually interested, and can handle terms like "peer-to-peer", or "decentralize"
For someone who's never heard of bitcoin, five minutes is too much. The trick may be in dynamically adjusting your verbosity, as you gauge the interest and intelligence of the person. The other is to tread lightly. You don't need to be the one who makes it all click. You can't. You're a stranger. You just need to plant a seed.

There's been a long, drawn-out learning curve for bitcoin. And there will continue to be as newbies continue to flock to it. People are learning how to safely treat their bitcoins, and the bitcoins of their customers.
The same will happen with ripple. People will learn not to overextend credit. People will learn that friends are only friends until they owe you $1000USD. Then they're jerks ;p
Just as people have learned polite ways to decline facebook friendships - or learned the price - they will learn polite ways to decline extending credit. They might also learn, however, that it's important to value and cultivate your friendships. You never know when you might find yourself in need of a temporary personal loan. With ripple, that loan might come from 1 close friend or 40 acquaintances. But if you welsh on a loan, you'll find your name is mud with 400 acquaintances.

 today,  the poor are  PROHIBITED  from saving -  by the policies of their  central  bank (near-zero interest rates). 
 bitcoin gives back that power.  eventually,  btc price  appreciation will match interest rates of yesteryear.

*Once* the world adopts bitcoin en masse, value of savings will grow at a much slower pace. It will effectively grow at the rate you'd expect to earn interest on fiat (if govt didn't play around with it so much).

One where you've got the funds to back it - within your account. You take the loan (you short something), then sell the asset/currency because you believe that by the time you need to pay it back, you can buy it back at a lower price.

tx fees  won't be a problem for years.   advantage?  seriously?  for me,  it's the decentralization/near-invcorruptibility (never say never).
 its  scheduled,  limited,  decaying inflation **not**  worth it  for average Joe?  Does the average Joe need to save for his retirement?

It gets much better after that 30 days. It's good that you got the ball rolling. Eventually you could perform instant-buys. You'd need to progress down their validation path to do this, though.

Even cashing out, the potential is still there. Bitcoin won't always grow at this pace, but it will always offer vastly better protection from government fingers than anything ever before seen. **This** is what will benefit the poor the most.

It's innovative, but I wonder about the possibility of these film creators voting for their own films. Will some of them 'game' the vote?
EDIT: Not sure if it's an issue.


So donating to your own cause ends up funding others too.

Descriptions of eMunie and Decrits use the word "hoarding" (in the pejorative). They can't work.
Netcoin, voting? Not sure that these kinds of things can't be gamed.
I've read a little about the mini-blockchain. It seems innovative.
Zerocoin sounds very interesting. Would like to see it combined with some non-inflationary altcoin.

Bitcoin is no stranger to spurts of quick growth. I think it's possible for the price to ballpark-triple each year, and end up at $250/btc in Feb 2015.

I think you're right. Smallish, artisanal vendors stand to gain from a global market with freeish transactions. Big, established vendors are in no hurry - not hungry enough to care about this relatively small currency.

not everything can be money. there are certain qualities that are necessary (or very important). Bitcoin has these qualities:
portable, fungible, divisible, rare, durable, identifiable, a store of value
Most things don't have these qualities. Bitcoin does.

No. It's related to database access - I think validating each block.

 depends on lots of things - like how much disposable  money you have.  but,  if the price recovers in 3-6  months this would've been a good  move

A rising bitcoin will eventually benefit all of humanity. Some power will shift from centralized organizations, to individuals. This will allow more decisions to be made closer to the information that is required for those decisions.

Well said. But they'll fight it tooth and nail once they understand it.
So, it's a race between:
* a critical mass adopting it

 this is a good point.  it didn't occur to me,  but,  some people might be getting the wrong idea  from recent  Silk Road  articles.
Something similar happened when I was advocating for bitcoin to a friend, a few  months ago.  he related the story of someone stealing computer power to mine ( or a virus  that mined) -  as if that was some proof of bitcoin's  inadequacy.  "So what?", I  thought. 
 when I  pressed  further, I realized that he thought that this somehow implied people could *counterfeit*  bitcoins.  once I explained this merely implied people could  steal electricity/ computing power,  and convert to btc, all  was well.     
tl;dr:  it  sometimes takes a good listener  to really hear  the misunderstandings others may have.
