I was just thinking that an alien looking at this picture would have to assume they’re different species. Like a picture of a bobcat and a tiger.
Edit: ...aaaand it’s porn.

But it is worth it to them. They make more money by breaking the law and paying the fines than by obeying the law.

It is well known that he was a national socialist. He was extreme right-wing because he advocated for a rigid social/political/economic hierarchy. Free-market capitalism is a liberal ideology.
The left-right dynamic originated from the French government at the end of the 18th century. Those who supported the king and a rigid social and political hierarchy consisting of people who are naturally better and naturally inferior sat on the right. Those who believed everyone was equal sat on the left. Right wingers like Hitler preach forced inequality. Leftists like Stalin preach forced equality.

Fascists are fascists, are they not?

Well any political partisanship is by definition divisive. Fascism is divisive along racial, religious or nationalistic lines. It assumes that people are naturally better or worse based on the circumstances of their birth. So when Clinton called out the basket of deplorables, she was judging the content of their character. She was speaking about the racists and misogynists specifically - people who divided themselves by being deplorable. She was actually defending many Trump supporters who are good people, and not in that basket. Now I despise the Clintons, but I don't fault her for that comment and it's certainly not fascist.
Antifa don't really seem like a political party with a coherent ideology. They seem more like a bunch of cowardly thugs that lash out at people that they don't agree with. Jacobins would be a much better descriptor for them than fascist.


That's spot-on, but we also have to see how the elite right tries to entrench its aristocracy through government. This is why I'm a libertarian in the middle.

I appreciate your sincerity. My definition was not intended to be comprehensive. I understand that fascism has a lot of nuance and you did pick up on some things that I neglected for brevity's sake. I would argue that totalitarianism is a symptom of fascism more than part of the core ideology. Fascism is about forced inequality. It's about division. Worthy vs. unworthy. Us versus them. That's what makes it distinctively right-wing. Conversely, leftists preach forced equality with relatively less regard for merit and talent. Fascists also disregard merit, instead favoring race, religion, nationality, gender, etc. as ways to rank people.
I assure you that I'm very well read on the subject, but I'm always open to hearing from new sources. I personally like Umberto Eco's "Ur-Fascism" as a definitive treatise on what comprises fascism.

Agreed, but it's in a precarious position given income inequality, federal debt, private debt and the liquidity trap.


Well Congress controls spending, and that debt was largely the result of the recession. Also, the deficit fell each year he was president except for '16 fwiw






They are pretty emotionless, so I think that's the wrong perspective on them. They did what they had to do to save the economy, given the circumstances. Sure, they kicked the can down the road but if Bush hadn't gone on an insane spending spree on Medicare D, Iraq, and the tax cut, he wouldn't have neutered the government's ability to enact effective fiscal policy.


That's because he's a moron.


I still don't see how they're related at all.

No he just masturbates to pictures of his daughter Ivanka.

I'm rather well-read on the subject already so here goes off the top of my head:
It's a right-wing nationalistic political ideology. It uses fear and force to create a social/political/economic hierarchy. It demands blind loyalty, and abhors dissent. It opposes liberalism, which in contrast advocates for individual rights and equality before the law. History's most prominent fascists include Francisco Franco, Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler.

I've been doing this too, but I've also been watching the price closely and making the purchases during a relative dip. I've been able to get the average down a bit lower.

Thanks I’ll look into that?

Lol it was a typo?

How did you sell your bcash if it was on a wallet? I use coinbase and bread. Not sure how I should sell them if coinbase doesn’t support it.

I don’t grow my food for the same reason I don’t sew my own clothes. Those things are easy to produce, so it’s cheaper to have a bunch of dumb yokels do it and instead focus on work that is more valuable to society.
I’d happily kick back some welfare to assuage their mushy bodies and minds were it not for them constantly trying to drag us back to the 1890s.

I do all those things to some degree. YouTube is filled with tutorials. They are all relatively easy which is why the services are cheap to acquire.
