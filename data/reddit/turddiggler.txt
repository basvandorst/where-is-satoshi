Your title is as sensational as the claim made by Sergei Glazyev.
It is truly laughable that Russia would have any chance at crashing the value of the U.S. dollar by dropping it as their reserve currency.  They would essentially be defaulting on their debt to the west which would be **far more** devastating to the Ruble than the US dollar.

Petroleum is Russia's largest export (over 60%) and if they were to stop their export of petroleum it would crush their economy and further isolate them in global community and specifically more so in with eastern European countries (mostly their allies) that rely heavily on Russia's gas petroleum.
Just to illustrate.  Look at what Russia would loose if they stopped exporting petroleum.  You can see the problem as they are not very diversified in exports.  If they wanted to hurt the U.S. with petroleum **they should sell as much of their product as they can** at a lower price than our product to our buyers, thus reducing our GDP in petroleum.

You're asking far too much in my opinion.  When you subtract the hardware aren't you asking about $50 for a SD card with armory preinstalled?  Other very profitable and big hobby electronic vendors sell similar SD cards with Debian preinstalled for about $10.

Your reply is equally as irritating as the OP's post because sure enough, for every post like the OP's is some comment like yours that does not help.

"Who's telling the truth"?!? This is laughable! Simple look at all of the people on bitcointalk.org and the Black Arrow forum asking for a refund on undelivered or underperforming and unsafe hardware. These people aren't self fulfilling or dishonest, they're the victims of a scam on behalf of Black Arrow and their vendors.
After my experience, I can with good conscious inform you to avoid business with Black Arrow or Minersource.

It's typical of Coinbase to run out of coin or go down when it's a good time to buy.  It's fucking irritating because it is typical and not isolated events.  Right, and if it's scalability problems then stop hosting the site on a Rasberry Pi and expand the network.  For fucks sake, I think Reddit has better up-time.  AHhhhh fuck...I'm going to explode!

I would be pissed if I found out one of my underaged kids had 60 BTC and kept it a secret from me while I paid for everything.   Do you know how expensive it is to raise a child?  Not only that, this kid is probably going to piss away a fair amount of his coin on worthless shit and maybe even loose his mini fortune in the process.  It could be spent on far better things such as college or other big ticket items.  
Son think of it this way,  if I came across 60 coins do you think my family would not benefit from that or do you think it would all be spent solely on me?  You bet they'd benefit from it!  
Jesus....kids today, now get off my lawn!

Calling the paper wallet in  Coinbase as easy as bill pay is a stretch at best.     
The paper wallet function of Coinbase frequently lags and hangs.  It's also less secure than other forms if cold storage.

If you live in the US, banks are required to report to transactions greater than 10K to the IRS (and others).  Banks can report any transaction at any time if they wish.  Furthermore, you'll need to pay taxes on the coin transferred to your bank at (I'm guessing) 15-25%.  If you live in the US, don't fuck with the IRS, they can really make yours and your parents life miserable.
So if you're on Reddit asking these questions from strangers, you probably should consider receive some help from a professional financial/tax adviser.

Good catch.
I am amazed at the shills that continue with their support of Coinbase and yes, I have a Coinbase account.    
This is huge deal and needs to be fixed!  They must have some licensing with the FTC and if we organize and complain to the right federal organization things should change.      
Before I get down voted, remember that the plethora of problems with Coinbase are systemic and if you don't believe that you've been living under a rock.  How would you like to have closed an account only to be hacked and be held responsible for 10 BTC deducted from your bank account.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:19:12
Just to add to this, I for one am not tired of seeing valid complaints about Coinbase as they do have some serious problems they need to fix, even for an upcoming company in an emerging market.  It's the constant stream of illogical complaints with absolutely zero standing that detract for the valid and serious complaints posted here.  People are so sick of reading about your stupid nonsense (as if someone is actually counting out Bitcoins and dis/approving  each transaction...lolz) complaints that they all get lumped together as BS now.  What a waist of my time....goodby.

One way is to use bitaddress.org(bitaddress.org)  
* item 1 Download the provided source code from them.
* Run on an 'air gap' computer or via live USB of Ubuntu without internet connection.  This way you are not using a generator while you are online and thus, nobody can see your private key.  
Side note: It'd be nice if Coinbase would make it paper wallet genarator open and downloadable.  Furthermore it would be great if they could somehow make a read only version native to their platform so we can use their paper money and still be able to see our total balance in our Coinbase accounts.

 A genuine question: How can recovery be made when a private key is needed for transfer which is held anonymously by the individual.   I think I understand how you can see the stolen coin in the block, but I don't see how you can forcibly transfer it unless you had a 51% agreement (right?).  Could this be something written into the source?  Something similar to PayPal [*shutter*] where claims could be initiated?

The main reason for paper BTC is that you have a Private Key that has never been on the internet.  
With that being said, I have read that Coinbase uses a third part QR code generator and transmits it and your private key (obviously) over the internet.  Coinbase does state that they do not store your private key server side but the whole process as it's currently set up defeats the purpose of having a paper wallet in the first place.  If you want a private key that has never been in the internet, why would you use an online service to make a private key?
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:51:15
No, but the person I linked my post to did.  
My comment still stands on the chances of you successfully being able to manage it.  Their is a reason you are not old enough to open a bank account by yourself just like their is a reason you can drive until your of X age.  Am I right?  You already stated you don't know how BTC really works and that you used it only for video games in the past.
