If I wanted to whore karma I'll just upload the picture of my cats shaved leg! which you can see here from my twitter. 
Saying I'm going to mine bitcoins is hardly going to give me karma. 
**EDIT** this picture of me driving with the cat in the way would get way more karma? Maybe I should upload it to reddit just to annoy you?

That's actually a not a bad idea! My friend owns a gym so that could be an avenue? Though not a single clue on set-up cost in that area. Could be something worth it in the long run I guess!

Neither...just nobody pays 5k for a cat. We love our cat very much! but I think you could buy a decent second hand car with that money.
Anyway if you wanted to know about the well being of our lovely pet... A friend went to a vet acting as the owner and got free treatment as their family are on benefits.

I'm not looking to use standard hardware. I'm going all out building pro beasts if it's worth it. For E.G I'd get every setup with Asus MARS II GeForce GTX 580 X2 3072MB cards and all the sweetness to go along with that.
I'm not worried about the electricity bill at the moment though.. over time on a scale like what I'm thinking, that there will be money to cover overheads anyway.
200-300 a day ain't bad either in the long run if the economy can last the foreseeable years? So what do you think about 50-100 high end machines hashing the fuck out of this idea? money to be made then?
I don't want to chuck 100k into the btc market if I'm honest though...as atleast if I have this physcal hardware and it goes tits up then atleast I can recover whatever. Though if btcs are worth $0.1 tomorrow and I have 100k then that'd be gay. I say this because when I've looked into this the coins have jumped in value by a good few dollars which isn't okay for me to chuck that money around that way.

Crazy got me rich, but this area is way out my zone!

**£**100k is just test money like I've stated. If there's something else that I could do that'd be better than mining and it made total sense, then I'd have no problem investing more change. 
I'm asking for peoples opinions in something that's either going to happen in the world...or die out. So thanks for your thought which some points are helpful, but your tone comes across a bit sour.

That's right.. from my hobby sport I made about 60k, though that's not even considered my job.

Nobody pays £5k for a cat. You'd buy 100 new ones.

Not a troll, just trying to learn more and if there's a gap which I can break into then why not? Only if it makes sure sense and viable to achieve.
Reason I said electricity bill wont be a problem as in our factory the electricity bill is so huge that this really wouldn't effect our situation. 
Minus the electricity bill and getting all the correct hardware the world could offer..do I have something to work with?

I was thinking of a way to cycle the energy made back into the power actually.
There's a way to transfer thermal heat back to electrical which is something I'll consider and maybe along side solar!
