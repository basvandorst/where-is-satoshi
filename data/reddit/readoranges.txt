With Mason Tvert as the MPP's Communications Director, it's just a matter of time until cannabis is legal nationwide!  Mason is such a genius when it comes to media awareness (as the founder of SAFER) and is one of the many great people who were instrumental in legalizing it in Colorado.
He'd often refer to the Denver mayor as a drug dealer for owning bars/alcohol establishment.  I think he dressed as a chicken one time to mock the mayor.  Would often repeat the same clear message in newspapers/TV about marijuana being safer than alcohol.  And he used clever marketing tactics in billboards to encourage people to vote yes on legalization.  I know there's many great people at the MPP too but just wanted to highlight these points.

Shearer's case was unrelated but his mistake was not taking a plea deal.  He got six years because he asserted his 6th Amendment Right to a trial.  This is tangentially related to my other comment about how feds will unjustly punish people who challenge them.

Obviously the NY Fed dominates the system, thus the owners of it such as JP Morgan can and have reaped ridiculous benefits.
Interestingly, Senator Owen from Oklahoma who is credited with formulating the compromise of the Federal Reserve Act noted in the objections to the proposed National Reserve Association:


concentrated in the executive officers (private persons), who 
would be located in New York City, and this power would be 
sufficient to coerce every member bank and large business in 
America. It was desirable, on the contrary, that the control of 
the system should be in the hands of the Government of the 
United States, and, second, **that the reserve centers should be not concentrated in any one city where a small 
clique could control the system.**

During the Enlightenment, I believe this was an idea that men would have to gradually be taught to be self-reliant.  So one strategy was placing essentially libertarians near rulers to guide them in the right direction over time.  But that mankind might not be ready for it.

I'm against central planning too, especially when the planners are far from those they are governing.  But to say all central planning is bad, is a blanket statement that lacks nuance.  I believe in classical liberalism and federalism, even on an international level, and some of the most prominent classical liberals of the 18th century did too.  However, if you broach that issue today you get shut down by narrow-minded libertarian talking points.

This is why they'll have to offer USD deposits via a Visa card.  I believe it's much easier to process deposits than withdraws.  
Then if withdraws are only in Bitcoin, they would have to instruct their customers on how to open an account at Coinbase or Circle, and then use some tumbling process to hide the origin of the coins.  
And all game denominations should be in USD.  Bitcoin should basically be transparent to the average user unless they withdraw.
