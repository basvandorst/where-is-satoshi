Where I live I can get a home-loan at 2% interest rate - Why should I pay it off if the inflation is the same or higher?

There's not much difference between going down 90% and going down 100%. Your losses only differ by 10%. 90% for an investor would be pretty much the same kind of devastating hit.
I could see a regulation potentially happen that could bring it down 90%. If US, Europe were to ban Bitcoin for example.

From this we could yield the result that Coinbase is actually thinking larger. They are sacrificing people's trust in their service for actual valuation for Bitcoin. If the greater good is Bitcoin succeeding then they are the hero we need, but not the hero we like.
Assuming people become uncertain if the price is dropping, and dropping by more than 10% for example. Once the drama has ended, Bitcoin price starts going up again, people forget all about uncertainty and take it as "challenge overcome".

I... don't think you understand the definition of fiat.

I'd argue that it's all very specific on the individual and the individual's circumstances.
Life is always full of risks. Some risks are greater than others. Taking intelligent risks pays off in my experience compared to being completely safe as most people are risk-averse. You get 'free stuff' for being willing to fill the gaps where no-one else will.
a) I can take an insurance which covers job loss when taking home loan if it truly is a real worry. 
b) This depends wholly on the industry you are in, but for some industries such as IT, it's easy to estimate that these jobs are one of the last ones to disappear, and at that point universal basic income will probably come to play. If you create yourself a future plan where you study for the future jobs I'd figure one is good to go. If this plan fails, it's probably because the whole world has collapsed or if one gets head injury.
c) I'd say the advice also depends on what you save vs what you make. If you spend only 50% of what you make and you put 6 - 12 months worth of wages to no risk easy to liquidate savings you can easily put anything you want in high risk assets even if you have debt. You could also insure yourself appropriately to make risks non-issue. Of course you'd have to reconsider the loan cost if you insure yourself, but it's still very possible one could reasonably expect to get bigger yield from investing than cost of debt.
d) You could buy a house where it's reasonable to assume the prices are going higher. World population is growing so unless we inhabit some other planets first I'd assume there must be locations which could reasonably assumed to continue going higher in price. And in case of any accidents you have insurance.
My point is that it's not just so black and white that one could say "always pay debt off first".

Depends on the interest of that debt. If the interest is same as inflation - I should pay as minimum as possible. Even if it's higher than inflation, if I can get more yield from investing than the debt interest I should also invest the money, not pay off the debt.

You could in the same way regret anything you bought with dollars as you could have bought bitcoin with those dollars instead.

I started my life at 0. And also when I became independent I was at 0. Don't think it's that bad at all tbh.
If you have a family that is dependant on the house and your net worth, sure it might be a bad idea and "idiotic", but otherwise if you know you can live with being at 0 then why not.

The article in my opinion is completely retarded. If anything it gives the impression that the author does not understand the meaning of the term blockchain and tries to project it as if nobody else knows what it means.

I would argue that if bitcoin was the currency, gap between the rich and poor would widen even more because it would be more difficult to enforce taxes.

How do you know it's the people taking loans who are not going to be punished by higher interest rates? Want to get education - even higher student loan interest rates. Want to buy a home - higher interest rates?
Is it really good if more people will be having to rent (aka feeding the wallets of already existing property owners widening the gap between rich and poor even more) and less people will be able to get an education (widening the gap between less educated and highly educated)?
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:10:22
Is that good though? Is it good in general for the gap between the rich and poor to widen? I'd assume cryptocurrencies would allow for that since value stored there would be harder to tax or regulate. If there was no regulation money would make money and snowball. Is it also any better if companies were to box out the banks?
Rich might be better off for some time, but general productivity would fall. More people would be unhappy.
At which point will cryptocurrency benefit the whole society? What are the benefits of cryptocurrency for society as a whole?

There is a real lack of context here. Losing all your net worth doesn't necessarily mean losing everything and there's absolutely no context about what is one's general income and savings. Why even discuss without mentioning those variables?
It could be a frugal software engineer who has spent 2 years saving and within 2 years saved $100k. 
Even if he lost that he still is able to save 50% of whatever he makes so it's not the end of the world.

It's worse than having 100k in the bank, but I'd say depending how bad it is is dependant on how much time 100k is worth for you. If you can save 100k within 2 years, I'd definitely risk the 100k. If it takes me to save it 50 years, then maybe not.

Where I'm living there's specialized grocery delivery as well as supermarkets support that. You can choose a time slot of 2 hours in which time they will deliver it. Seems to work out well and is a great time saver. 40+ EUR per purchase and it will be free of charge.
