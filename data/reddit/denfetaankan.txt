It's the same in Western Europe. People simply don't understand the dangers with debt. They have debts on their house, their car, their phone and their TV. I mean people are looking at me like I'm some kind of idiot when I'm buying stuff and pay the full price at once.

In that case fiat currency would be the car without engine. Just like the flint stone family's car the passengers would have to use their legs. Because it's a slow way to get to your destination and the fact that you'd likely be exhausted very quick also makes it easy for a car thief to hijack your car and get away with it.

I assume the car represents the blockchain and the non existent engine represents bitcoin. Let's define bitcoin then: "a car with engine". Fiat on the other hand is only the horse, if you use cash you can ride the horse. With banks and credit cards on the other hand someone else is riding the horse for you while you're being tied to a rope and forced to run after the horse. The guy on the horse can cut the rope at any time and escape with your horse and there's nothing you can do about it.

In my old home country politicians used to say "*it doesn't cost you more than a pizza*" when they tried to defend waste of taxpayers money. From now on I gotta remember this as a counter argument ;-)

Following him home and then what? kill him? that wouldn't give them access to his wallet. There may be dumb robbers but I'm sure most of them are smart enough not to stick around if there's nothing to steal.

It's more profitable to hodl is all I can say after a year in cloud mining. Ponzi schemes are common and you're often paying the full price for the hardware plus maintenance but after a year or two it's no longer yours. Lifetime contracts can change at any time and open ended contracts can cancel at any time if it's not profitable for a limited time. 
Not to mention the disadvantages of centralized industrial sized mining facilities. If you gonna mine for profit then get your own miner or signup at a normal cloud hosting company and mine whenever it's profitable.

Wouldn't be fun if you didn't ;)
