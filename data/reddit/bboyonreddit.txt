Much appreciated. Works like a charm! Now I know my Coinbase wallet works too. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:23:10
Haha, mind if I see how this works?
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:00:50
Im in the "Got liek 8 dollars worth" club or something.

And avoiding dates

*Toot toot* welcome aboard! I also have fell in love with the concept of Bitcoin. I bought at around $3200 so I'm definitely a late adopter too. Im so mad I didn't buy earlier but as they say "the best time to buy was a few years ago, the next best time is now". Good luck and **HODL**

Yeah, in the long run the more you can buy and do with Bitcoin the closer it will become to a currency instead of an investment opportunity. It's just Bitcoin becoming itself.
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:00:03
If your referring to the constant debate between the two coins, same. Nobody is really seeing the big picture here.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:33:18
Buy into it slowly. Maybe 100-200$ at a time. If you need that money don't drop it all into Bitcoin, maybe just a bit to get started. Just be smart.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:16:10
I mean I understand that Bitcoin has to continue to be used for it to have value, but we don't just magically "agree it's worth something".
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:38:40
This is why people are chased away from Bitcoin, don't be a dick.
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:04:23
Oh god no haha, you can purchase down to 0.00000001 btc, which at the moment is equal to 0.00004032 US dollars. Bitcoins can be bought in extremely low quantity, it just won't be a full coin (which doesn't change anything)
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:09:28
I get that but they could of worded it closer to something like "Bitcoin has value because of the way its are created, by cracking difficult computer problems" or something dumb like that.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:53:27
Jumped in right and the spike and thought I made a bad decision.
**It was a good decision.**
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:01:28
I actually was planning on waking up today and buying a bit. I'm tempted to wait because they're is no way it's going to stay on this high... right???
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:14:27
Yep, I mean everyone wants to pounce on a good economic opportunity, but this kind of trend isn't sustainable (as we're seeing).
I think my issue with BCash is that its just a hard currency to get behind, and it makes it confusing to new users.
"Whats this Bitcoin Cash? Is it the same as Bitcoin?" It just makes it more confusing for someone unfamiliar in the cryptocurrency space, not to mention all the other problems with it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:42:41
Let's just accept we're all excited like little kids again
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:43:29
int BitcoinValue = 4000;
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:37:17
Sorry to see this. SegWit should help alleviate this problem and it's right around the corner.
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:24:33
This isn't how money should work
@_date: 2018-07-20 19:43:49
Yeah that's gonna be a no for me dog.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:29:35
Thanks dude! I love the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:56:32
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:04:01
I could send you Bitcoin! It works! :D
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:54:27
Woops! Sorry about that. Ill test it somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:14:39
Unfortunately i'm 13 (lol). So I cant exactly buy any. I was thinking of doing a mail-in to bitbrothers LLC but I don't know if my wallet will work. Any faster way I could test it?  
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:14:19
I need to test mine, too.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:38:40
I actually didn't send anything. I just put my Coinbase app up to it and saw that it read it!
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:10:46
Alright thanks! Daily bitcoins doesn't have a minimum payout amount but ill wait a while and see what happens!
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:54:36
I would suggest Coinbase. Really user-friendly. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:59:50
I really can't buy Bitcoins. Considering I am 13 years old. I can in fact do a mail in. The thing is, I want to make sure my wallet is going to work.
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:57:59
I know, I just want to know if it will work before I make large transactions...
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:02:56
1LJtktfjTpjgxKGTJb8wMJg3HZNFr2Wb9Y This is my Bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:21:08
Cool! Thanks for the reply.
