They won't, only evangelists will.

I get that, but I see a lot of bearwhale suddenly in the subreddit. I think I missed something.

Closed source devs hate the blind.

No, he was not talking to you garmondbozia. He was replying to another user and having a friendly internet pissing contest.

If you invested $140K into btc alone, chances are its a loss that you can easily take. Especially if you aren't a dummy and didn't invest all your savings into one vehicle. 
Not everyone can absorb the loss that you can. Whales can afford the drop and the wait. Whales can take this very minor hit while the same hit can really hurt people. 
So while your stoic bullish attitude is cute, it does nothing for you or anyone else. At a time like this a sense of urgency, fear and drive to preserve your savings is more important and useful to people.

Very solid and secure. They skimped out on a couple of very minor security features, but its no biggie.

Or they are placating you with a non-answer because they can't be bothered.

I'm going to agree with you. I think the paper fully deserved the grade it got. It reads like a get-rich-quick scam email you get from Nigeria. If felt like he was trying to con the teacher rather than write an informative piece. If you ask me a "get-rich-quick scam" is in no way age appropriate. 
I'm also willing to bet that the teacher had a more specific lite hearted and kiddy like assignment that OP didn't follow.

I wrote a bit about conductive materials/electricity/static on thick tin foil. I even attached a battery to it to make a little light bulb light up. I thought I was so clever. I put it on her desk and she looked at me like a fucking moron and asked "What is this?". I tried to explain but she just said "I can't read this!" and handed it back. I walked away dejected and crumbled it up and threw it away. 
She was rite though, it was a little hard to read in the bright glowing school lights.

I'm not sure why this article was even upvoted. He is no more qualified to make that statement than any other layman. Its just wild speculation and wishful thinking on his part, he has nothing to backup his statements.

What sane person who actually gives a crap about bitcoins would be against this? ATM its kinda hard to find quality websites or quality products to actually spend bitcoins on. Anything that helps bitcoin grow is good.

Thanks for the reply. Ive always wanted to visit Japan! 
Can you tell me a little bit more about B though? Or maybe point me at something where I can learn a little bit more about that?

I wonder if OP thinks scolding the community like a disappointed parent is good for the subreddits image?

I really had no idea there was all this BFL hate until I found this subreddit. 
A friend of mine purchased 3 of their 5ghs boxes sometime in winter of 2012, it shipped to him in may (I think) and hasn't had a single issue. Hes had them going 24/7 since then and just recently purchased their 600ghs card. So hes been very happy with BFL. 
But after I saw all the issues with BFL in this subreddit, I brought it to his attention. He said "Yeah, someone people are upset that they got their orders late...". I tried to explain to him that people were saying worse shit about BFL than that. But hes only had a positive experience. So, I don't know.

Pricy ticket, where the fuck are you going? lol
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:51:22
It would still be nice to know...

Why do you do yens? I'm very curious.
