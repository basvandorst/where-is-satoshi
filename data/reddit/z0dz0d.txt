Here's my thoughts on the matter.  Most people's bitcoin journey goes a lot like this below:
Stage 1: Heard about bitcoin but it's already so high, damn, you missed the party.  You're casually paying attention.
Stage 2: Learn more about bitcoin, finally buy some, price goes up 30%, 50%, whatever, holy shit, sell!  Nice, just made a nice profit!  But as you watch for the longer term, price keeps going up, "oh shit", imagine what it could have been.  Now you're hooked and paying attention, and again, you feel like you missed the party again.
Stage 3: Bitcoin is so high now, I can't jump back in anymore, it's peaked.  What about these alt-coins?  IF they moon like bitcoin did, i could make a fortune!  They're so cheap compared to bitcoin!  I'll buy some of those.  Now you're holding alt-coins, but as you learn more, you realize they're not bitcoin, it's so much harder to justify what makes them special.  If you're lucky, you get out at breakeven or a profit.  If not, you've at least learned a valuable lesson.
Stage 4: You finally "get it".  Bitcoin, for lots of reasons (independence from corporations and reserve banks, the network effect, hashing power, etc) is the only one that matters.  The rest are just experiments, and when something takes off and is solid, bitcoin goes ahead and implements it either in the base layer or as a layer 2 solution rendering that alt-coin obsolete.  Now, you simply stack and hodl, at least until the rest of the world figures out the same (or until life dictates you can't, i.e. emergencies, life events bigger than bitcoin, etc).  
Phase 4 is the "not selling" folks.  The "if you think 10k is expensive, just give it some time" folks.  The "party's just getting started" folks.

@_date: 2019-07-27 04:36:16
Inside what?
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:46:40
This is a crazy metric to base anything on, just because it isn't moving on the blockchain doesn't mean bitcoin isn't "changing hands" or that it's with a hodler.
1) The exchanges have the majority of their coins in cold storage which wouldn't move unless people start withdrawing (which they rarely do regardless of how many times they read they should), regardless of how many buys and sells happen on the exchange.
2) GBTC trades huge volumes daily but none of that is represented on the blockchain as its OTC shares that actually move.

The 6.25 BTC is certainly a mistake, but plenty of miners mine empty blocks, that's their right (and I'd imagine it simplifies their mining code).  In that case, they can collect the 12.5 BTC coinbase but they don't get to collect any of those sweet, sweet transaction fees.  That'll happen less and less as the coinbase decreases and transaction fees increase.

I'll get downvoted for this, but as a secure store of wealth, most everything else on earth (gold, USD, baseball cards, collectable plates) has retained value better than bitcoin over the past 10 months.

My point was that lack of volatility on the price rarely holds for this long, and seems to indicate something different is happening.  
Some people saying manipulation, i.e. someone is holding it here to make it more likely that an ETF could be approved.  
ome people say speculative traders are leaving, which is driving down volatility.  
Some people say it's forming a bottom.  
Who knows, but after watching the price of bitcoin for 2 years (and I know that's not long for many folks here) this is different, as if consensus has been reached (for now).
I'm long for bitcoin because i know that each use case that goes live for bitcoin increases its inherent value and those use cases will just keep coming and coming.

I can't speak for the rest of the world, but the US tried and failed to convert to the metric system (which is why we buy milk in gallons today), THEN failed to roll it back fully (hence why we buy our Coca-Cola in liters)..

@_date: 2019-08-19 15:43:27
I read that during the financial crisis, the fed made 0% loans available to the major banks to create liquidity in the markets.  The banks took out loans, but the liquidity wasn't materializing.  When the fed looked into it, the major banks borrowed the money at 0%, and then "invested" it in 3% treasury bonds from the US gov't.  THEN, as they made a profit off the interest, the bank CEOs argued for big bonuses as the banks were showing a profit again.  All while the economy burned.  These are the perverse incentives created by artificially low interest rates and creating money from nothing.

If you're taking out a 5kEUR loan and you can afford it, then the world isn't going to end if BTC crashes.  Most likely the only thing that will happen is that you'll have less money at the end of the loan than if you invested 500 EUR per month for a year.  If I was in a loan situation, I'd imagine it would make me more prone to panic selling (or trying to "catch a falling knife" during a downturn than if i was sticking to a DCA plan.

Here's how I look at it, I may be mistaken about some of this below, so don't use me as some sort of definitive information source.  But here's my understanding:
1) If you want exposure to the movement of bitcoin prices from an IRA that supports OTC stocks like this, GBTC is probably the best way to get it today.
2) the premium over NAV comes from a) the custody soluion they employee and b) it being the only game in town, and when it's not, that premium will decrease or go away entirely.
3) It's a custodial solution.  You don't actually control your bitcoin.  If (or some would say, when) GBTC gets hacked and their bitcoins go away, your investment would be impacted.
4) GBTC charges a 2% fee, so the ratio of stock to bitcoin is continually going down every day.  if bitcoin stays constant, the stock price will go down over time.
Some benefits of GBTC OVER bitcoin are:
1) From a tax deferred account, you can buy and sell to your hearts content without creating any "taxable events" or worrying about short/long term capital gains impacts.  Those taxable events only happen upon withdrawal from the IRA, etc.
2) They have a very well designed custody partner/solution, meaning it's safer in their custody solution than a wallet the average investor themselves (cold wallets, they won't "forget" their keys, etc).  But, to be clear, the risk of those coins getting stolen or burned is NOT zero.

When bitcoin is a $1m/BTC then a satoshi = 1 USD cent, which is the soonest that anyone could have any meaningful reservations about the smallest unit.  At that point, the options would be:
  a) mint more bitcoin (which would also devalue everyone's holdings) or 
  b) enhance bitcoin to allow for fractions of a satoshi.  
Option B would of course win out and everything would keep chugging along.

Customer wants to invest in bitcoin but doesn't want to learn about hardware wallets, etc.  Their thinking is that some professional could safeguard their investment better than they can with their limited knowledge.  A custodial service that focuses on security will likely do a better job keeping a wallet secure than your uncle Bob who struggles to post Facebook pictures.

As miners turn off their miners, difficulty will come down (happens every 2 weeks, right?) until the market reaches equilibrium.  If you can mine today profitably, difficulty will adjust to give you effectively that same reward soon again.

Since the 91:1 split, every share of GBTC now equates to roughly .001 bitcoin.  (Before that, every share equated to roughly .091 bitcoins which makes the mental math a bit harder).  
At closing on Friday, March 9th bitcoin was trading at $9000, so the NAV for a share of GBTC is $9.  But, GBTC was trading at 14.99 at closing, which is a premium of just about 66% 
(GBTC Price / (Bitcoin Price * .001)) - 1

The only way to buy most other alt-coins is by trading them for bitcoin on a trading platform, so we don't have a real alt-coin value in dollars to report.  
Instead, when we calculate what they're worth, we have to use their relative worth versus bitcoin and then that amount of bitcoin's relative value in $s.
So when that amount in bitcoin drops (because bitcoin drops), the alt-coin's relative value drops to match.

Right now it's the only game in town if you want to trade BTC as if it was a stock.  But the 80% premium versus NAV is a concern, as the floor drops out once there is a real BTC ETF alternative.  At least with the 91:1 split, it's relatively easy to calculate the premium against NAV.

Why should 0 fee Txs be a bad thing?  I understand those transactions should have the lowest priority, but if there are no more transactions to fill up a block, why not include the oldest of those?  The reward to the miner would the same regardless of whether they ignored or not, and could be useful for wallet consolidations, etc.

We don't know what will happen in the short term, so day trading is just gambling.  But those that hodl feel like it's going way up in the long term.  With that conviction, it's easy to hodl through the ups and downs that come with bitcoin.  
And I suppose that part of it is just being on the ride for long enough that those lurches feel like a normal day in bitcoin.

Not exactly.  If I create a wallet, deposit 1 btc, then withdraw 1 btc, it exists in the blockchain but has a zero balance.  If I create a wallet but never deposit any btc, then it doesn't ever show up on the blockchain.

I think if you create a bitcoin wallet but don't add bitcoin to it, then the wallet doesn't actually exist on the blockchain yet.  So creating 10k empty wallets doesn't actually do anything except waste CPU cycles on your computer.

Completely reasonable to withdraw any bitcoin you have sitting at an exchange under investigation for fraud.  
If you're not planning to trade it in the near future, best option is to put it in your own cold wallet or in custody from someone you trust more.

It's the short sellers creating an inadvertent but intense feedback loop.

When people are buying to hodl, the transactional amount will be large.  When they're using it in every day life, the amounts will be smaller.  More and more, you'll see smaller transactions shift to lightning, and then on-chain transactions will mostly be the initiation and closure of lightning channels, gradually getting larger over time to minimize fees.
Looking at the total value of bitcoin transactions per day is probably a better indicator of overall adoption than measuring the average transaction value.
