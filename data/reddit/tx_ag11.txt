I was curious about this as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:25:38
My concern is I don't want someone losing everything because of what I said. I know human nature. People look for the easy way out and as we've seen here with people using college tuition, mortgaging homes, pulling loans, etc.. 
I don't want that on my conscience. I can take people saying, or thinking, I'm the office idiot invested in fake money. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:32:41
Once is an accident. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is a pattern. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:39:53
I'm really getting tired of the tulips comparison. When someone says that I just tune them out because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about. They're just parroting what the tv is telling them instead of actually researching it. People are sheep. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:09:06
Under $8K and under $9K.

Only things certain in life; death and taxes.

This guy gets it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:35:10
It appears there is a correction, or dip, every January. I think this time it was just more prevalent because the price of the coins were so high. It'll head back up. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:14:32
You invested your college tuition because you believed in the project? Really? You sure it wasn't to make a quick buck? 
I mean I get throwing some cash towards a project you believe in, but that should be like $100 or something if you're strapped for cash. Not your college tuition. 
You got greedy and learned a valuable lesson. No such thing as easy money. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:02:06
So then it's correct and the article is alarmism. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:02:37
You're being sent more than $15K in coin? Hmm.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:18:05
Yeah, but it's not being alarmist about it. That's my point. All this is is FUD and it's been debunked. If it can't scale past a certain point that it would increase power consumption to an exorbitant level, why worry? 
I see the down votes, sorry for not buying into the alarmism. Some of us can think for ourselves. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:29:20
No,but it does reference the digiconomist article that the guardian used as a source. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:24:56
Don't give crypto advice to anyone. If they ask, politely tell them to research on their own. This is my approach. I'll discuss some coins, but I always tell them to research the hell out of it before jumping in cause it can crash. Otherwise, you open yourself up to this. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:14:54
Price and value are separate. What someone will pay is it's price. It's value may or may not be subjective. If you're trying to figure out how high it will go or where it will stop, it depends on what someone's willing to pay. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:19:08
Yeah, and as bad as asset forfeiture laws are here I'm not sure I'd risk it. But that's up to you. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:59:20
According to the 2018 tax code, yes. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:11:13
No, that's what stupidity looks like. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:56:12
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:02:57
Ok, that was funny. XD
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:45:41
Mines bookmarked at $213. Wish I'd had the cash to dump into it back then. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:58:59
Haha! That's good. 
Are those real words? 
I don't know man I'm down $80K. I'm in deep. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:40:07
I feel great! Y'all quit being a bunch of weenies. XD
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:54:50
Haha! Thanks! Needed a laugh. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:22:14
Why assume it won't improve? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:48:59
Maybe, but I know I should have researched more. I could have gotten back in at a lot more had I sold in 2017 and bought now. Lesson learned on my end and I will be making the appropriate adjustment this year. The crappy thing is, I think this year will be huge for crypto due to Goldman Sachs opening a crypto exchange in June as well as the increased visibility to the main populace because of the media. My fear is it may not ever get this low again. I'm gonna be buying as soon as I'm paid. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:25:50
I see. If you don't need the cash why not use it as a seed to invest in coins? Although, I guess at some point you'd have to cash out. IDK. Just spitballing. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:41:29
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:05:17
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:24:05
They'd shoot you last. Maybe take a finger or two. You like your genitals? Maybe they take them. I'm being facetious BTW.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:36:31
Exactly. We're still in the early stages. This is the time to get in. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:10:23
Start working the corners. I'm told you get used to the taste. XD
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:52:15
Interesting. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:13:35
That's what I was thinking. Guy must be hen pecked. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:22:23
If people keep investing irresponsibly, that's exactly what will happen. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:02:49
Oh, I didn't sell at all. I'm in it long term. I'm just saying, had I researched a little more I would have seen that selling late last year would have made more sense and allowed me to buy back in really low. But again, I'm fine with it. Always learning. :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:18:58
That was stupid. Sorry, but that was an incredibly irresponsible thing to do. I hope you're young and learn from this. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:14:14
Not sure why you even said anything. It wasn't at zero and you didn't cash out. And if your wife has that kind of money stashed away/hidden from you, well that would be a bigger deal to me.
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:26:06
I did think that sketch was hilarious. XD
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:37:41
Work overtime to make your money back. Good that you learned from this. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:31:09
Consult a tax professional. I personally am not risking tax evasion charges. Everyone do what you feel is best for you. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:52:22
Hasn't this been debunked already? It's alarmism. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:17:36
Hahaha! Wapoo.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:36:13
But are they hodling? XD
I'm thinking about that guy from hangover. But did you die? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:16:33
I DGAF what the government thinks about what something should be valued at. That isn't their job. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:11:43
I just wish they'd hurry up and ship my S9. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:47:21
Best response. /Thread. 
LOL! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:21:19
Crypto is pretty much supply and demand. Fortunately, lots of these coins do have real uses. These aren't stocks and you can't really look at them that way. But I get what you're getting at, I'm just not sure there's a real answer. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:16:05
Have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:27:31
Shouldn't a reduction in mining drive up the cost per coin? Since there is less being produced?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:35:16
Got it. Now that I'm thinking about it this makes sense because when it was like $1 I remember people talking about earning upwards of 50 BTC or so. Thanks for the clarification. 
@_date: 2019-11-30 14:50:44
He shouldn't have been in N. Korea. That's why he was arrested. So unless you're teaching people in N. Korea I don't think you'll have much issue.
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:43:32
IT TURNS THE FROGS GAY!!
@_date: 2019-02-05 14:40:00
Still think that's one of the best movie monologues ever.
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:16:43
There's Gemini, Coinbase, Bittrex, etc..
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:07:06
Inherited wealth still pays for things. They still buy things, assets, investments, services, etc.. That money still works even if the person who inherited it doesn't. How is that a blood clot on the economy?
Your complaint seems to be with the people and not the money. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:15:46
5 million or 100 billion, what difference does that make? It's still messed up. What does fishing and catch and release have to do with it?  Please explain. 
Also, I don't think you're using the word dichotomy properly here. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:14:10
How is that using The American fabric and sucking it dry? Apple isn't any different than any other large business. What do you mean "to some extent"? What business, outside of nonprofits, is about profits to some extent?
Please explain.
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:38:13
Yes, that's called running a business. Can't run a business if you don't profit. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:09:48
Man, at this point I'm so far into it I'm just gonna ride this fucker to the bottom Slim Pickens style. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:10:48
WELCOME TO CRYPTO!! ��
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:12:56
So, a superior version then. ��
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:07:54
I recently bought and received a S9 miner. About $2K with tax and shipping. I'm mining about $13-$25 USD a day. I'm run in a warehouse someone owns so I pay a flat fee for the space. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:36:10
I'm confused. 
How is that different than now? I can vote by not purchasing products from companies I disagree with or think they have an inferior product. Everyone can participate now. 
Maybe I misunderstood your post. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:32:48
If you started out poor, you started at the same ground floor as everyone else did. Your parents, being smart about how they handled money, were able to escape that situation giving you a better opportunity. So you've had money, or at least benefited from your parents having money, most of your life. If you are upset about that, then give your money to others. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:03:33
I'm making about $100/week, give or take and my only expense is $100/month for the space. So, while I'd rather be making $50-$70 a day like when it was higher I'm still doing ok all things considered.
I have a S9 from bitmain. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:50:27
Does anyone know the legal ramifications of this? Is this considered a legit purchase? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:13:26
Love isn't always on time, oh, oh, oh. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:40:41
If I knew it was going to $1 million what would I do now? I'd buy as much as I could afford. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:58:29
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-09-01 23:34:44
Right?! ��������
@_date: 2019-09-01 18:33:39
I read that as bitch chocolate. ����
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:38:44
I don't have Twitter. What did he write?
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:39:30
Doesn't matter. If you think that it's ok for government to basically take everything you made after you die, that's messed up.
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:15:36
So does it actually have anything to do with Bitcoin or you just wanted to bash people who support Trump? I really don't care if you do want to bash them and not sure why they are pathetic and toxic and really don't care either. 
I'm just trying not to miss information relating to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:48:18
So then provide them? I don't understand when people do this and then don't provide examples of what they're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:57:18
Thank you. I'll watch this. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:49:36
Who said this? And what does this have to do with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:51:18
Which you've not provided one example of. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:17:14
Aha! Got it. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:42:03
What did he lie about? I haven't heard that story yet? 
@_date: 2018-12-23 17:30:36
No one is gonna read that. We all have problems. Go beg elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:46:51
No, that's your opinion. Learn the difference please.
