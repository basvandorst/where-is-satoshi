Because people will start to realize it can't be used as a currency, there are better crypto options for use as a transactional currency and BTC has no inherent industrial use. And unlike gold, it's not held as a reserve by any central back nor backed by the entire written human history valuing it as wealth.
BTCs value will never be zero, but it could and likely will be worth much, much less than it is today over the long-term.
And if I'm being totally honest I just want to see John McAfee eat his own dick.

It's that they have enough money and leverage to make the market. It's not manipulation or theft if you have more money and leverage than everyone else. This is 'murikah. 
But you are left guessing which side they're taking next or you just hold and hope you are on the right side of the long term trend. Would not recommend you hold a short position long term though :P.
All the proof you need is every other futures market in existence today. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:17:28
Unless you think retail investors can successfully arbitrage the spot price against leveraged futures money, the futures market will drive the price. Very few futures traders take actual delivery of whatever they are trading.

clearly explained this to you but I'll give it one more try:  
Your point would only be valid if people had to buy Bitcoin to use block-chain technology, but they do not. Bitcoin does not have a monopoly on block-chain technology. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:56:33
The futures market will drive the physical price, so the futures market will affect everyone buying and selling actual bitcoins (retail investors amongst others). Retail investors will effectively be shut out of futures trading because contracts will be too expensive, even with margin, for most retail investors to trade.
To be clear, futures go both ways. The immense leverage managed money and traders bring to the plate can drive the price both up and down. But there's more opportunity on the down side than upside right now because of the run up in the price.
If I was a betting man, futures market opens with a sharp increase and not long thereafter a massive short the ends the party for a while. From there, who knows.

Let's suppose that at some point BTC is updated to become useful on a transactional basis. Further, let us suspend belief for a moment that it hasn't already missed the bus to alt-coins that are already transactionally viable and will somehow retain market share dominance after all this shit is fixed. 
Bitcoin still has to overcome one more hurdle to be useful as a currency: volatility. Something so volatile will never gain widespread acceptance as a usable currency. Why? Morons that put their rent money in something that might lose half its fucking value within a week leaving them unable to make rent will be Darwin'ed out of the gene pool really quick.
Here's the kicker: if Bitcoin wasn't volatile 95% of current BTC owners who are amateur hour HODLer/speculators would lose interest and sell to chase the next get rich quick scheme. The remaining 5% of people really interested in the technology and still holding BTC end up exactly where I said they would - with a much lower valued Bitcoin. Perhaps usable at that point, but you're still left with a lower valued asset than you have today.   
So if you "believe in Blockchain" and because of that will "never sell", allow me to explain what you're doing in another way: you've subsidized some non-believer in a get rich quick scheme.

Central banks and major companies like Amazon are  already creating their own cryptocurrency and it will have real world application in transactions.
[here's BTCs biggest problem](
Bitcoin will never die, but it has no real use as a currency, which means the future that every speculating HODLer is betting on ain't going to happen.

Unless it breaks $15,000 USD really soon further deterioration is likely... and if it breaks below the psychological threshold of $10,000 we might see the herds stampede to the exit and witness an epic crash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:09
If you sell on the dip you've been wrong 100% of the time so far...
... but the danger of investing in Bitcoin is that a huge % of BTC are owned by a tiny number of people. There have been large dumps at the open of Asian trading every day for the past week. If one of the bitcoin "whales" that owns a big chunk is selling out that could be enough to change sentiment. When sentiment changes and all the Koreans and Japanese retail investors with their life savings and second mortgages invested in BTC think the tide has turned they're all going to sell too.
Good luck!

Why would it? Futures specifically decouple the underlying asset itself from trading. That's what makes a Futures market a Futures market.
Right now shorting Bitcoin is very cumbersome. That is all going to change when Futures open up. I'm not saying short attacks will occur right away, but the speculative frenzy around Bitcoin looks ripe for traders to come in and wipe out retail investors. 
They do it in the gold futures market all the time, where coordinated attacks will buy or sell billions of dollars of gold futures in a minutes. They never own the underlying asset (e.g. gold).
So opening up Futures for Bitcoin is going to introduce a whole new class of investor to the game. Nobody knows if this will be positive or negative for BTC, but with even less (e.g. none) regulatory oversight over Bitcoin vs Gold futures, you can bet volatility is going to increase when the Futures markets open.

This is not just another correction. The amount of volume and money involved in this "correction" is insane. People are talking like dropping $100 billion in market cap in a week is "just another correction".
For fun, why don't you lookup how many companies on this entire planet have a market capitalization in excess of $100 billion.

Possible. But given the price action has gone parabolic the opportunity, at least initially, lies on the short side of the trade. We will see. I'll be watching with interest from the sidelines on this one.

I think there are a lot of speculators in bitcoin and they always bail when things go down.
The latest decline rammed below support then spiked back above support. Looks like classic shorts... Once their target(support lines) are hit they cover their positions. Other shorts get squeezed and cover. After the dust settles the price action goes sideways again for a while.
So the real question is who makes the next big move, bulls or bears?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:22:30
It depends which day of the week you're talking about. On Sunday, $3.50. By Friday, $0.01 because the price of BTC crashed.

They have sunk costs. You try to buy a GPU in the last, oh, fuck I dunno, 2 years? Oil projects with billions of invested capital don't immediately shut down when the price of oil drops below the cost of production. 
Eventually, yes, if the low prices persist. But hope is the human condition and cheap credit let's entities hope way longer than they should.
