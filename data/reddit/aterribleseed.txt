Everything she posts makes me sad. Bad jokes, racist jokes, low intelligence... I am pretty sure they are really young. Probably too young to use a bitcoin atm... or reddit.

I will try to find you the whitepaper for his 90s bank in a bit. 
Also his book would be the best reference for his professional writing sample.

He has been a fundamental founder in standards still used today globally. 
-Creator of MIME
-Company pioneered PGP
-Passionate about open source in mainstream software development
-"Programming as if People Mattered: Friendly Programs, Software Engineering, and Other Noble Delusions" - Is basically the soul of crypto and used to be standard teaching in colleges.
-This is his idea of a joke: 
-Pretty much invented the idea of commerce through smtp and sms.
The only difference between modern crypto and his initial bank:
-The ledger was hosted on a centralized server instead of a decentralized and incentivized network.
-Requests were sent via smtp to Infohaus ledger instead of a constant secure updating of nodes and receipts for changes. 
Essentially though the only difference is the decentralization because through smtp or sms the merchant would gain creation of receipt for the transaction on the linear ledger.

Nathaniel Borenstein.
Invented first virtual bank in the 90s, before PayPal they used a ledger on a server called infohaus to process bank transactions via smtp for merchants. Of course PayPal somehow opened up the doors to legally offer that service to consumers as well which put fvb out of business. The company also pioneered pgp encryption to secure their transactions. IN THE 90s.
During bitcoins creation he worked for IBM open source. Ran it actually...

If what you are saying is true, aren't you concerned about posting in on a non proxy ip using an email registered reddit account? 
Is university in Pakistan relatively good or could you get a better education elsewhere?
Nut up and buy some bitcoin imo. You already made that decision when you posted in here.

That almost made sense.
