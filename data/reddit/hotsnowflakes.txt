What is actual costs? Bitcoin (or any sound money) won’t make things automatically cheaper, instead it would make reflect the true market value rather than inflated values due to excess money supply(unsound)

Mistake? Why? If I don't feel that way, I should be forced to feel happy for my cohorts?
@_date: 2018-09-04 11:12:27
The reason, the house prices are inflated (&gt;500k) etc. is because of fiat banks lending new money without value into circulation, by choosing to instead save in bitcoin you can expedite the collapse of these fiat banks and the associated house prices to come down and get inline with real market values.

By resources, I presume you are thinking only about goods and natural resources. What about people's labour? People can be conned to give their labour like you said by money, but money of a certain kind, money that has no way to correctly measure people's labour. If you don't let people measure their output then they will be exploited like slaves. after all someone can claim that they have the better idea and the people are supposed to give their labour towards it. This will not automatically cause entropy or will take a long time as more and more people get conned towards fake money and slave their labour away. There is also no guarantee that this thing will stop getting shared, as the conned people will spread the ideas, its like slavery begets more slavery. The root cause is not any money but the wrong kind of money.
The point I am making is not all kinds of money are evil. Money is a way to measure output. But then in order to be good it has to have certain properties.

Thanks for taking the time to provide a detailed reply. You might think it is obvious but it wasn't for me. Now some Qs.


Why would scientists, social leaders and deep thinkers be better than others? Are all the examples that you think of the these 3, were all of them good as per you.? For Example Karl Marx was a deep thinker, Hitler was a social leader. Who decides which one of these are good and how?
why do you use the word "attacking" ... did you mean "competing" ? If a committee of scientists, social leaders and deep thinkers came up with a bad idea, isn't it better to ~~attack~~ compete with it?


I love the idea of creative activities, but who decides what is a worthy shared goal and how? I think money is a measure of deciding which activities are worthwhile and which aren't.
But there is bad money (fiat) which has a tendency to make us make wrong decisions (debt, war, resource wastage etc.) and good money (gold, bitcoin ...) which encourages to ration our activities and lead us to make better decisions both in our own life and when we deal with others.

@_date: 2018-10-25 20:57:56

Bitcoin is *a kind of* money *different from all present ones*, ~~and will go away soon~~  maybe *but I suspect something similar will always exist* , ~~along~~ ~~with all the other point scoring games~~  the example you mentioned, people living in a ideal society of cooperation will also have a way of point scoring (something like honour points or respect points or some other form of virtue signalling)  , **as a way of organizing our lives**.

Glad, someone is talking sense. If anybody thinks they can do better, run your own miner.
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:21:22
While they do convey the notion, spaces make it hard to deal with when copying prices formatted that way. Also when mixed with other content like labels which may also have spaces in them, there is a bit of a cognitive overhead to process what you are reading.
Commas appear to convey the separation more clearly and the magnitude. Easy to implement copying as contiguous characters.
Anyway, both choices are better than decimals in BTC.

@_date: 2019-06-22 00:22:19
Capital Gains Tax is designed (or has become) a way to ensure no other instrument can compete with national fiat currencies. Government's know that there is nothing stopping citizens to choose other means of exchange besides fiat if left on their own. Any asset that is not controlled by the government and that shows properties of perfect money would expose the inflation tampering of fiat currencies. Hence governments tax capital gains  on non-fiat exchange instruments.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:25:21


But it's the same governments that decide what the inflation levels are. All western economies are telling us inflation is really really low despite the ginormous money printing and fall of living standards among the middle class.

it's incorrect to call the forks "bitcoins" as by the very nature of forks, each fork is a new accounting unit with a different name, yes there could be more than 21 million accounting units, but there is only one "21 million bitcoins". Can you see the difference? Not all the forks might survive or gain sufficient adoption as the original "21 million bitcoins".

No, wallets don't and should not count them together, Wallets will list them as separate units, like you have 2 BTC, 5 LTC etc.
It is like having a fiat wallet with 5 dollars, 5 EUROS etc. and you can't pay in a shop with euros that accepts only dollars making them distinct entities.
Though the origins of litecoin etc. are from the same codebase, since the forks their transaction history has diverged, so you can't spend in one place of another. Thereby you should not combine their total supply limits together.
I understand we should not use the word "guaranteed", but not for the above reasons. 
It is possible our successors will with total consensus decide to migrate to a fork with more supply than 21 million called bitcoin-2.0, but as long as there are even 2 people using the original bitcoin 1.0, the bitcoin supply remains at 21 million.
