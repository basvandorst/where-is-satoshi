This means Libra...not a coin, just another digital debit card

I don't think Trumps comments  matter one way or another. We've weathered financial institutions, hedge and fund managers attack it and even whole countries banning the trading and it still chugs along. I wouldn't put too much more thought into his words. He'll prob come around

Just bought my coin at the 11.1k dip. Decentralized...say whatever you want you can't take it away, only legitimize it by bringing it to the light.
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:17:53
Lol, I just bought more at the $11.1k minor dip
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:58:20
I just bought another half a coin. I ain't scurred.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:56:58
it's a dip, you don't sell, you buy!
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:11:36
I bought at 400, 1.2k, 1.8k, 3k, 6k, 7k, 12k, 14k. My average is still lower than current. if you want to day trade, go for it. I'll hold my coins, and if that makes me stupid, we'll see who laughing at the end.

I just bought at 9800 another half coin. it's a long haul not a short jog. timing is fine but what if it takes off to 13k after you sell, then you're out of the gains. buy dips hold until ath.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:57:32
just bought another half coin sub 10k ��
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:09:03
I've bought some all over the place, between 3k and 13k and still hold. Some days I'm doing great others worse, but it's a buy and hold so the only day the price matters if it's going to zero or it's time to sell at an ath. I haven't seen the day to sell yet.

I did the exact same thing with some alt coins at around 10k BTC price that were flat or only slightly up while BTC was a rocket. I'll repurchase alts if desired but my gains for now are far superior after the move.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:39:55
thanks I think I bought some of yours ��
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:58:55
Bought some at 5K, fell to 3k and bought more, bought at 8k and just again at 11.5k. These little slides and recoveries should make you feel better in that we have the buying power to push through as a bull to 20k plus. Just hodl and enjoy the coaster ride...and buy lows.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:20:43
Yep down, up then down. Market correction, could be a whale selling seeing how quickly it fell off. personally I'm ok seeing this rocket slow a bit, keeps the FOMO people out. steady growth &gt; rocket then crash
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:40:17
I looked at % growth of all my alt coins and moved them into BTC as the rise was higher in comparison. Past wave the alt coins rose when BTC stalled. could move to BTC and when it stagnate a few days go back to LTC. Maybe only do it with some and not all, diversification is never a bad idea.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:23:17
haha welcome to why BTC HODL is called a roller coaster. welcome to the ride, buckle up, relax and buy the low dips.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:30:45
New buyers react like BTC and crypto is investing, like you're investing in a stock company and that's an error.
Just buy it for whatever it is when you want to get some and hold it. You're buying currency. People don't freak out when the dollar loses $0.20 to the British Pound. Stop thinking like a stock and start thinking like you're just exchanging currency....for a better one.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:44:24
If you hodl, this doesn’t matter. There is a reason the memes relate to a roller coaster, welcome to the ride lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:43:42
I think people remember the ath from last time and are holding past break even to see if they can gain profit closer to 18+k. I bought at a higher price on the backside of the fall, around 8k and could be making a profit since, but I'm hodl all the way now. I think seeing that the coin survived and is thriving makes the pump and dump people to consider a buy and hold position. May change at ath but I think people are holding until then. Prob see a lot of resistance at 18k again as ath buyers take an even and walk.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:13:39
Buy a little here and there as you can, shoot for dips but don't worry about it too much, just buy and hodl. My  Avg buy price is over 10K, had some at 3k, 5,k, 8k and got some around 12.5k. Some of those were near the highs at the time. Don't fret, just hodl for the win.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:46:14
I'll feel better when we still see solid support after a new ath as I'm still wondering about 18k again, but for now I'm enjoying the ride.
@_date: 2019-12-23 07:18:05
100% scam, if it made any money they wouldn't be inviting you to their party, they'd keep it themselves.
@_date: 2019-12-18 01:12:43
Don't hold!!!
Buy.
