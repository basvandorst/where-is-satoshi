thanks for clarifying.
"(...) Although Dorsey did not specify the exact amount, the maximum weekly buy limit for Bitcoin on mobile payment company Square’s CashApp is $10,000."
I'm sure he has a sizeable position regardless. Definitely more than most people in this forum. Obviously, compared to the rest of his wealth, it might not be as big. But still.

One can easily build a dividend portfolio of solid stocks that yields 7%-8%.

Oof, the world would change overnight if something like that happened. 9/11 would look small compared to that. Hopefully, nothing like that ever occurs.

Yeah. I do see some folks panicking already. Are we probably close to the bottom? Regardless, I'm not selling.

Well, my point is not really about Bitcoin TA. It can be useful for short term trading, but it has a large margin of error. Ultimately the Bitcoin thesis hinges on decentralization and scarcity (S2F model). If that holds, adoption should follow as second and third layers develop and make BTC more convenient for the masses.

Take it easy bud. 1) Being a Redditor isn't a credential; it's just an online account. 2) Whether right or wrong, our opinions on Bitcoin don't detract from our value as human beings. 3) There's no need to be offensive to express your disagreement (maybe you're projecting your own insecurities? Just a thought).  
Anyways, have a nice day.
