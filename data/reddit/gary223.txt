This is a nice development. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 00:12:40
Hmm...it's worth a look. Good thinking. I'll check if it's possible.

I chatted with them last week in their support. They said they plan to accept it eventually but don't know when. 'sometime in the future'.
@_date: 2014-01-24 00:11:29
Looks great, thank you.
@_date: 2014-02-02 10:46:57
Great idea. Whether it'll actually happen we will see. It would be a game changer. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:59:38
Sorry about that, I'm my phone rather than laptop.

I love bitcoin but wearing a hoodie around with the logo on it...I dunno. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:32:56
Not really. Currencies took a massive dive when it occurred. Which in turn would surely affect bitcoin if it happened again. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 23:17:55
If it gets up to $2000 by the end of 2014 it'll be doing well. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 14:51:55
Fair enough! 
@_date: 2014-01-24 00:11:51
I'll research a bit into them. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-04 23:23:24
We'll definitely see more as the price rises and then falls again if the same trends continue. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:11:18
I bought at 1k. I could be kicking myself for not waiting longer. But I'm not. Simply because I believe one day it'll be worth a lot more. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:33:30
Interesting take on it. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:40:38
I'd imagine this would be for their Google Apps suite. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:55:34
Show some compassion.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:52:32
Are you sure about that? I get the error 'In order to trade on bitcoin.de, you have to verify the bank data.' when I try to buy. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:59:42
How long did it take you guys to get verified? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:01:30
I can't use that but thanks for the information. Can't wait to get started. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:13:59
John Lewis is doing well for himself on there. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:27:28
In general it needs to become more accessible to the average joe on the street. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:56:03
In a related note, that old guy on Bloomberg is unbearable. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:27:05
The ease of use of bitcoin is something which will improve with time. The internet and PC's were not easy to use when they first emerged. More and more advances will be made which will allow bitcoin to become more accessible to the masses. It's only a matter of time I feel. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:46:19
So exciting, watching it live. On 1007 as I type this. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:55:47
I honestly wouldn't scam people but I guess I have no way of proving that. 
I could go with an existing charity but the thing is I don't know for sure it's going where it should be going. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:29:59
My girlfriend is from Brazil. The main thing she took from it is that bitcoin has crashed, exact words were 'lost almost all value' due to the Chinese restrictions.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:39:44
I suggest calling them and just being honest on how you obtained the money. I'm interested also on how they react. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:42:30
Wow, so sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:45:39
Sorry one last question, how long do you need to wait for the BitCoin to be in your account after it has been purchased with BitCoin.de? Days or within minutes/hours?
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:36:36
I had the exact same issue last night.
