Yeah, I got so excited because I thought I could sub to someone with bitcoin but nope, only turbo.
@_date: 2014-10-21 07:03:03
If you had asked me that question a year ago, I would have said no. But now, I have to say yes. The potential for bitcoin to revolutionize our traditional views of a centralized economy is HUGE. Blockchain technology also has huge potential outside of currencies. Remember that bitcoin is only the tip of the iceberg. We haven't even started yet.

Bitcoin isn't supposed to work this way, but coinbase and wikipedia both need to comply with OPEC sanctions. At this point, a workaround is the best you're going to get.

Hey, can someone compare this with electrum?
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:09:31
In essence, yes. In this case, bitcoin is being used as a payment method, not a currency.
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:21:28
Wow, I was not expecting a formal response! Thank you for the reply.
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:32:05
They're currently at 37% of the total hashrate... which I believe is lower than before. It doesn't matter if the hashrate is going up, everyone's hashrate is going up. What matters is the percentage. We can start worrying when it hits 40% again.
@_date: 2014-06-30 18:06:39
Alright, thanks!

I'm sorry, but how is that relevant?
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:25:56
Ok, I understand. Still, a week delay for an online purchase does indicate that the company should step it up a bit (although I agree that calling the company "shit" is extreme)

@_date: 2013-11-07 21:48:12
Personally, I'm waiting it out.
no matter what people say, BTC cannot sustain this level. It rose wayy too quick to be sustainable (reference April). Some people say it's different. yes. It is different from April. But it's going to go back down eventually. in the long term, who knows, it might be worth $700 in a couple of years. But in the short term view, I think it's going to go back down $20~$40 dollars with correction. The media hype isn't helping the stability...

I checked, it said it was up. However, I'm on coinchat and other people seem to be having the same issue. I was wondering if the issue could be fixed.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:57:09
NOPE. Just search "mtgox withdrawl" on reddit or google. No use repeating every complaint here.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:14:00
I've seen comments about the withdrawl system being backed up before; this seems to be a problem with the trading engine. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:19:22
no... phones are too vulnerable. There has been a couple of android viruses floating around. Plus, you're more likely to lose your phone than an HDD.

@_date: 2013-11-11 06:28:14
I'm still using it, but only for playing around with small amounts (we're talking ~16 dollars here) and I'm afraid of my BTC withdrawl being stuck in limbo right now. I'll pull out later.
A few answers:
1. It doesn't have liquidity.
2. Some people like that it's so volatile.
3. You can actually withdraw outside of the US.
Any more suggestions?
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:51:05
[This]( is a pretty "exhaustive list"
Also if you get the difficulty to automatically sync, and allow the user to input the hashing speed manually, outdating should not be an issue.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:34:19
Yeah... it's never good when technology that deals with money goes down. I thought mtgox would just shut down mtgox after a while, but...
especially since it's effecting other exchanges.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:43:30
With that much BTC, what you want to do is split them up between a cold wallet and a hot wallet.
Use a cold wallet for long-term storage; this would be a paper wallet. There's a lot of good info out there for this; basically it's a savings account that becomes a checking account once you withdraw out of it (does that make sense)?
Use a hot wallet for BTC that you plan on using to buy/tip/gamble/etc. This would be that local wallet you were talking about. Try electrum, as you don't have to download the blockchain every single time you want to use the wallet. It also syncs to a server, so if you lose your computer, you still have your bitcoins. It is NOT a online wallet, it is a local wallet that backs up.
(btw, try to keep the most of your btc in the cold wallet... it's safer. Also don't lose your paper wallet, put it in a safe or something.)
Now, you may want to wait to buy your bitcoins until the price goes down, as it is at its all time high right now. Or, if you think it'll go even higher (which is entirely possible) you can just buy right now!
Some of your fellow Canadians can help with actually buying the BTC, I'm sure. You may want to go through a trader on localbitcoins.com for an order that large; that way you can trade person-to-person, not over the internet.
good luck, and good bitcoining!
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:05:46
Britain... umm
Here's a couple of options.
 (probably your best bet for online)
You can either trade online or in-person on localbitcoins. If it's a large amount, you might actually be better off meeting in-person and trading for cash. The exchange rate might be a bit more expensive, but if it's a large amount that's not your biggest concern. Meet at a cafe or something.
Good luck!

Well, having a bitcoin QR code sticker on my laptop and backpack helped. People would come up to me in the hallway and either ask me what it was for or exclaim, "YOU USE BITCOIN TOOOOOO"
If they're not buying yet, give them some! I passed out around a dollar to each person that I got to make a wallet.
This was when bitcoin was like $150. Lot of happy bitcoiners at my school.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:56:37
For that to happen, the US would have to change its policies big time. Perhaps years later, when the price is wayyy more stable that what it is right now.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:34:09
So I have to manually contact the buyer every time it's with bitcoins? or can I somehow put that coinbase button into the "other" section?
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:21:09
Just give it to the kid, say he can have it when he's older, and use it like a investment fund.

Use a Paper Wallet with BIP0038 encryption. Put it in a safety deposit box in a bank. problem seolved.

Do you have free electricity?
Then, you might JUST get ROI in a couple of years.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:50:15
It depends on your outlook.
Short term? probably. China's cooling down a bit, and the "correction" from all the media hype and panic should be coming pretty soon.
Long term (several years)? not at all. we're expecting this thing to hit a $1000 dollars eventually even.
If it makes you feel better, just wait until the correction and buy in.

The key for me here is "decentralized" and "voluntary". Also, I would like to add on "anonymous". 
I think that the current fiat government currencies are fine; I just want something to be there when they crash.
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:17:23
Also, I'm pretty sure part of the reason mtgox is so much higher than btce is because it's hard to get fiat out of there.

Make a website that shows the tothemoonguy in a rocket. Label the earth as 0 and the moon as $1000. Show the rocket moving between the earth and the moon as the price of bitcoin changes.
aka a visual representation of the price of bitcoin. :D
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:29:36
Take the total amount that you have. Think of the amount that you will spend in the next 3 months. Leave them in the blockchain wallet, or your "hot" wallet, your backup and 2FA should keep it safe. 
Take the rest and put them in a cold storage. Get a paper wallet, laminate it, and put it in a safe or a safety deposit box in a bank (I know, kinda ironic). Make a separate paper wallet for 5~10 bitcoins each. This so that if you need more BTC in your "hot" wallet, you only have to import one paper wallet.
This should be good, the 2FA is pretty good at keeping things safe. The only issue now is blockchain.info getting cracked like inputs.io did, but if this is an issue you can always use bitcoin-qt or (my favorite) electrum.
EDIT: This is for like &gt;10 bitcoins... but even for &gt;1 bitcoins, it's always good to keep one paper wallet. If you have &lt;1 bitcoins, keep some on the cloud wallet and some on electrum or some sort of local wallet client. Split them up so if one goes down you still have the other.

I'm not familiar with Vircurex, but a popular explanation for Mtgox's price difference is that it's extremely hard to get USD out of mtgox.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:49:12
Hey there's that 20 dollar crash you were looking for on mtgox...
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:57:15
1. Make the paper wallet. Print it out.
2. Use the coinbase "withdraw" system. withdraw the BTC to the address on your paper wallet.
well that was easy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:27:38
Also the bitcoin merchants are increasing... more and more websites and stores are accepting bitcoin as payment
Of course, this won't take off until bitcoin becomes more stable...

For under 300, I suggest buying a GPU and mining Litecoin instead. However, if you don't care about losing money and more about powering bitcoin (which is fantastic), look into ASICs. They provide much better efficiency (more hashes per dollar) than GPUs. Go to for more info.
oh, stay away from butterflylabs.

I did it back when btc was ~120 on mtgox via Virwox (not certain)

I am also a Junior in high school. I have been spreading the word of bitcoin to many of my friends, and most of them are very interested. Just a couple of examples:
* I led a panel with a couple of my other bitcoin friends to explain the concept and system to a group of about 20~30 students and faculty, and got the majority of them set up with their own wallets. 
* Our engineering club and computer science club now accept bitcoin donations to support operating costs.
* A small unofficial "trading group" has developed, where 3~4 students meet every week after school, staring into graphs and statistics. 
* The Jalapeño miner that 4 of the board members of the engineering club pooled to buy back in July is about to ship. (I know ALL about the whole BFL thing... I'm just glad it's shipping)
* The local chess club (not associated with the school but a lot of their members are from my school) accepts bitcoin for chess lessons.
My friends are VERY interested in bitcoin, and more and more of them are getting introduced to bitcoin through the news, reddit, etc. All they need is an explanation and a little help setting up.
EDIT: word choice

Everyone will lose their shit eventually, especially with the volumes China is getting. Also, it's 300 on mtgox... let's see what happens with bitstamp hits 300.

It's possible, it's just really unreliable and sloowwww for USD (we're talking months here). I'm sure it's faster for Europe and especially Japan.
