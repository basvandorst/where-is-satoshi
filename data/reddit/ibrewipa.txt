You’re locked on the price you buy at

Excellent! What bike?
Edit: also, tea

If you are buying, you should hold.  Also, be willing to lose any investment in "new" ventures.

I don’t mean to be.  However, watching hour by hour is just self induced stress. I was harsh, granted.

I would not worry about it

Edit: Diversify and you mitigate risk.  Crytpo is no different, certainly in this market.

Agree with previous posts. Chill.  Investments should be comfortable and long term.

You bought at a price.  Live with that price.  This is not a quick money game anymore.  If you were lucky, you bought days/weeks/months/years ago and held.  You didn't.  Have a beer.

Yes. Agree.  Giving expectations to OP.  Still get the price at buy time.

Net neutrality is primarily going to impact the consumer on websites they visit and speed. Realistically speaking, the impact will be nil to bc

Lesson learned.

Stop investing

Ok, so you’re concerned at 6hrs after you locked in a price.  How quickly are you wanted to offload?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:22:11
Very nice. Careful on that bad boy.   The tea?

This week, I bought at 12k BC and have bought Eth and LC today.  Total about 4kUSD.  A comfortable risk.  I sold my early BC before thanksgiving. This past week has been... well fun?

Bought 12/6 - Received today

Correct.  It was a $500 assumption. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:54:43
That loss will not factor into capital losses at your  assumed income. Investments should never be quick decisions nor impulse 
Edit - it was a bad lap dance in the expensive room.
