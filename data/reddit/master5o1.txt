Bitcoin has to be $10,000 for 1 microbitcoin to be one cent. Until then, it isn't reasonable to *use* microbitcoins because it isn't within the 2dp that we use for currencies.

New Zealand already has a pretty cashless economy.
* Often free for once-off bank to bank transfers through web banking ($2 for APs common, often free depending on account type).
* EFTPOS/Debit card is ubiquitous and incurs no fees.
* Parking meters often have ability to pay by SMS. Parking buildings often have credit/debit card or EFTPOS.
Bitcoin transactions aren't a serious evolution above New Zealand's payment system.
A couple of weaker points in this are:
* No tip culture so no need for cash for tipping.
* Prices are almost always represented inclusive of taxes, avoiding calculation buggery.

Firstly, it isn't necessary to immediately correct them on the CEO issue.
It's more important to address that the value of your bitcoin did not change because the units did.
So the simplest way is to either say you were given so much for free, or that it is the same as "one grand" and "one thousand dollars".
Then once you've reassured then on the value, you can explain that it isn't a company.

PPNZ has no real ability to market or explain their opinions in the concise manner that anyone can understand without requiring being a bit of a nerd interested in the topics.
I was involved in (listening only) a Skype conversation between Kim Dotcom and some members of the Pirate Party of New Zealand. This happened about six months after the raid in 2012. He expressed interest in the party, with financing if he could have a major position.
I think we were all a little uncomfortable with the possibility of his involvement due to his dubious character.
Before the party could come to consensus of whether to accept he contacted us stating that his lawyers thought it wouldn't be wise to associate with a group called 'Pirate Party'. Fair dues.

Local trade calculation should be built into every mobile wallet.
Mycelium would have it easy to implement as they already have local trader for posted bid/ask ads. Could easily extend to the wallet send/receive calculator to add a markup or discount.

No no, solution is to remove local trader from the wallet app on the Play store. Provide the integrated app directly from Mycellium website.

It's about timing. If I'm buying something online, I can wait an hour for it to clear. If I'm buying something in store, I won't wait more than a minute. Hell, probably not more than 30 seconds.

And lo, there were blocks.

Pretty sure they'll drop 'bit' and just say 5 u 10 sat. 5 m 10 sat. Probably drop the t out of laziness for sa.
1 Bit = 1000 Emm,
1 Emm = 1000 Yew
1 Yew = 100 Sa. amirite?

He should really just sell the coins as empty wallets that the purchaser adds value to the number marked on the coin. Then he is only selling purses and wallets rather than doing currency minting and exchange.

You'd probably want to have a tamper on the thing to have it reject anything if the cash box has been broken into.

Because they're not convinced and is skeptical that 0.5 bitcoins is really worth and convertible to $60 (or what ever the value is at the time of attempted cash out).

Everyone says that you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin, you can buy smaller parts of one.
Everyone says that when the price goes high, people will just use mBTC or uBTC.
In order to use and buy simply lower fractions of bitcoin, the minimum volumes need to decrease to allow this.
I'm mainly pointing out the inconsistency of the error message that bitstamp gives. The trade is &gt;= $1, but it can't be placed, because it's apparently less than $1.

@_date: 2013-11-28 21:37:02
Minimum trade volume should probably be between $1 and $10, ideally closer to $1.
And the error message given on Bitstamp makes no sense if 0.001 btc is $1 and it complains that the trade should be at least $1 (when really it means at least 0.01 btc)

My opinion is that a lot of people want to make it appear as if bitcoin is really cheap.
So pushing for uBTC by default shows that only 1 unit is 0.08 US cents ($0.00008).
Making it look cheaper by changing the decimal place and SI prefix might bring in more people trying to buy the bitcoins at high prices.
IE: I read this thread as being just another "BUY BUY BUY" request.

You tend to need to buy at least 0.01 bitcoin, though.
The minimum volume for an order, let's call it an atom, should always be between $1 and $10.
Currently MtGox, BTC-E and Bitstamp all have 0.01 as their atom value. That's currently about $6.80-$7.80.
On BitNZ, before I asked the operator to change it, the atom size was 0.1. Having trades that were of a minimum of $20-$90 value (NZD) was getting really difficult. I asked the operator to drop it down and he made it 0.005, back inside that $1-$10 range.
