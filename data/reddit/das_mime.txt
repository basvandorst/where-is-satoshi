Besides which, what is even being disrupted? It's not like governments prohibit you from buying things from people in other countries. If you import things and pay for them with bitcoin you still are required to pay applicable tariffs. Bitcoin is pretty inconsequential to the greater financial scene.

What on earth makes you think bitcoin is a good investment method?

Seriously, we are unimaginably far away from understanding how the brain works, much less how to upload it.

Bitcoin is drastically worse than most standard currencies (like the dollar or euro) in terms of value storage, since it's extremely volatile.
Why do you think fiat currencies have an average lifetime of 27 years? Do you think it's because they're unstable as a financial medium or because short-lived states with their own currency tend to drag down the average lifetime?
Also, the 2008 financial meltdown had nothing to do with currency. Even if the entire US were operating on BTC at the time, it wouldn't have changed the fact that the banks made untenable investments based on bad debt.

...you don't actually believe that we're going to be uploading our entire consciousness in 36 years, do you? There is literally no chance of that.

"Popular futurologists"
You mean Michio Kaku? He has no idea what he's talking about. There's no reason to believe that such a thing will be possible, it's not even remotely close to the horizon of our current knowledge of neuroscience.

Well, you're wrong.

Then for shit's sake, save some money to retire on. This is like personal finance 101.

And in the post-WWII era, anyone who thinks that the US is somehow a more violent regime than the Khmer Rouge or Idi Amin or fucking North Korea has to be the single stupidest human being in existence.

In what way was Dresden unnecessary? There were upwards of hundred factories in Dresden which were churning out war materiel, and it was a major railway hub for getting German reinforcements to the front. In total war, you hit the enemy's manufacturing base. There's certainly a debate to be had about whether the bombing was justified, but to make it seem as though it was just a spurious, useless act is a little unrealistic.

Yes, everything that happens in the world has a single cause, and that's the United States!
Trying to set the US up as the exclusive cause of every single problem is as ridiculous as trying to pretend it's angelic.

Christ you're dumb. You think the Khmer Rouge is alright because they executed people by bludgeoning them to death since it was inexpensive?
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:35:21


The Khmer Rouge exterminated approximately **one quarter** of their own country in about four years (that's a conservative estimate, some estimates have gone as high as 35%). Regardless of all the problems with America's foreign policy (and they are legion), any comparison like what is making is just completely fucking insane.
