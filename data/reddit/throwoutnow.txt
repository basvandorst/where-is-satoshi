I appreciate your replies, I get it.
Also, my responses may have come off as ignorant, I did not intend any disrespect

Thanks - 
so, use a mixing service, as in...pay a fee?

I sort of see what you are saying about the fees, but anonymity is different that privacy.  I don't expect anonymity,  I do expect my balances to be private once they are mine.
Bitcoin does not stop inflation nor taxes, both of which I have no problem with.
As I said below to eyice, the person who sent me the original transaction could easily give out my address publicly once they know it, and then the whole world can see my money, which is no good if they are significant values.

It seems trivial to imagine that Alice could post my personal info along with the BTC address....  Now my info and my money balance is public!
*edit  -  and I guess what bothers me is that it is persistent - Anyone can then go and confirm that yes, I still hold that money.
hmmm, I see what you are saying, I can send the BTC to a different address, and no one would then be able to associate that address with me....
ok I get it - thank you

Actually you are incorrect.  You can use a mixer service to break up the trail of your BTC, therefore your BTC goes into a private (meaning unknown publicly) address - but this costs a fee.
As for splitting the money up, the original transaction would point to all those splits.
Thanks for replying, however I feel you are not correct at all.
*edit - sorry I don't mean to sound rude - I do get what you are saying about splitting it up, as those addresses could be anyone's (including my own) but this seems to be a bit impractical every time I am transacting with someone....but I see what you're saying

thanks for your reply - 
 I don't quite follow - if someone sends me 500 BTC in one transaction, I don't want that to be known and to be sitting there at that address - but I can't move it without leaving a totally public trail of where it goes....
@_date: 2013-03-13 01:23:10
Yes, so Alice sent me a large transaction, let's say 2500 BTC.  
Now I don't really trust Alice, and she has gone and got angry at me, and posted my receiving address on twitter....see?
Now everyone knows I have 10 grand sitting around - and this is supposed to be more anonymous than banking?  No one gets to see my bank balance, or even a partial balance.  Why would I want the world to know some of my holdings?
I hope that makes sense, I'm not sure how else to explain it.
And I think having to pay 1.5% fee just to move my BTC to a private address is totally and completely absurd!

That is true, thanks for the reply 
- and certainly where there is FUD, there is money to be made!
@_date: 2013-03-13 01:09:10
thanks - and that is what "losermcfail" said too.  
I guess what I don't understand is when/if I have a large transaction, how would I move those coins to a private location without paying a fee...
@_date: 2013-03-13 01:37:38
That is true, however I feel that in my example with Alice, the *whole world knows* and there is no course of action.  If a bank employee breaches my privacy, there is legal recourse.
Once the world knows, it certainly invites a great deal of stress, whereas I don't feel this with my bank, this is what I am saying...
