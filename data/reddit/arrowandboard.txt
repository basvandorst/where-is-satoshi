Any chance you guys will ever be plug and play with Shopify stores?

Thanks for the feedback, we don’t make our wallets with meat :)

Thanks for the feedback!  
  
That’s one benefit, we use a laser engraved so it will never disappear since it’s “cut” into the leather - no ink.  
  
A DIY stamp is possible but we wouldn’t be interested in making those since you can get that made from just about any rubber stamp manufacture for cheaper than we could make it.

Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs but I would like to add that you saying “meat is murder” will never make a significant impact of your beliefs to anyone.  
  
If you really want to stop animals from being killed for meat you should do as much as you can to help people understand the benefits of going vegan or at least going vegetarian.  
  
As a leather company, we are solely relying on tanneries in order to obtain hides.  
The tanneries are solely relying on the meat industry to make hides.  
If enough people stopped eating meat (specifically beef) the tanneries would be required to increase their prices and thus affect every leather goods company.  
  
In short, if less people eat meat, there would be less leather available and fewer leather companies would be operating.  
  
If our world ever got to a point like this, I’d be extremely happy at the change and would shut our doors.  
For now, we’ll continue to help each animal killed for meat to have more meaning than for just food.

The QR code would get engraved/cut into the ID slot area.

Hey r/Bitcoin!
We finally got our Shopify platform setup to accept bitcoin so I wanted to announce it.
We are a Texas-based company that offers premium leather carry goods like wallets, watch bands (mostly Apple Watch), wall art, and more.
We are always announcing new products too so keep an eye out!
All of our products are made in-house and almost exclusively handsewn.
We are so glad to finally be a part of the bitcoin community!

We keep up more on Instagram to be honest, our Twitter is [arrowandboard] (

I understand your position and I know it probably doesn't help your position much but, the hides our tannery gets are a direct byproduct of the meat industry.
We would never recommend killing animals solely for their hides as there are many leathers that come from an industry like this.

Correct, well, steer to be exact.

Glad to hear it! We have some products that we are working on that we are just wanting to perfect before releasing them, a bifold being one of them. Keep an eye out!

Thank you for pointing that out and that it something we are actively working on with the site (when you change selection options it changes the product photo).
Our simple wallet it 67mm (length) x 100mm (height).
With about 6-7 cards in mine, it thickens up to about 10mm (width).
We are always open to custom options but for the most part, we like to create the products and offer custom options with that product (thread colors, hardware, etc.)
