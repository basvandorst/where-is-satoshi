No, that's not what I'm saying at all :) What I'm asking is quite literal: "I do not understand what the point of these emotionally charged Bitcoin posts are on an already bought in audience - what does the poster want to achieve by doing this?"
That's it. I just don't get it. They can post what they want any time they want, but I'm scratching my head as to why.
PS: God I hope so ;)

I genuinely don't understand the point of posts like this. Who are you trying to convince on You're screaming into the echo chamber - and for what? What is the point of these macho-esc "I BELIEVE" type posts?
Not trying to be flippant here; I'm genuinely asking - why do people post this stuff?

I do expect it - and I’m allowed to question it. As I said, I’d love to know from OP what they’re trying to achieve.

Welcome to decentralized unregulated money.

You know, that's a fair point. I guess I'm reacting to the people who feel that this is fraud, needs an authority to address it, should be illegal, etc...
This is one of the many outcomes of this technology and bad actors like this should be expected. You're right though that this post is largely about reacting and notifying the larger community about Ver's fuckery, so I stand corrected there :)

Very fair.

100% this. You can’t have an unregulated decentralized currency and expect everyone to be a good actor. Human nature says that’s impossible. To be fair to them, they might even truly believe they’re the greater good.
