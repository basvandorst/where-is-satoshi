My RPI3 is using a Seagate USB external without an external power source and is doing just fine. I recommend turning off the GUI and non essential system services and getting the fastest sdcard you can afford. You will need about a GB or so of swap space, and the card needs to be fast or you will not have a good time.

I'm sorry, this is r/Bitcoin not r/bitpay.

Exchanges use core wallets. Kraken said for instance they are enabling segwit deposit as soon as it hits core.

A book is not worth 25 dollars. It is worth exactly that people are willing to pay to purchase it. You're complaining about a market correction hitting your overvalued work. You made some shitty music that nobody will pay for? And you want to somehow "protect" the value of it? Sorry buddy it has no goddamn value. Because it sucks. 
Sorry to break it to you, you wasted your time and now you are bitter.
What happened is the flood of Information available showed people that really your time is not worth any more then their time. Why should anybody pay Joe fucking schmo big bucks for his crappy music, crappy books, crappy finger painting? The value was artificial all along. You were an idiot and thought the value was intrinsic. Composing music fucking please. Your elevator moozak probably didn't impress your own mother. 
I along with the rest of the world am sick of your phoney baloney argument that p2p information sharing is the devil. It's simply a market correction. I pay for things I value, for instance I paid for a nice sandwich at a diner earlier because I felt it was worth the price. If suddenly there was a sandwich vendor on every corner making BLTs at exactly their market value you'd be damn right I will never set foot in a diner again unless they make a damn fine sandwich at a reasonable price.
By blaming file sharing you ignore that aspect of the market. Your work isn't without value after it's copied. Game of thrones was the most shared torrent of all time, and still made more money than bill nye's science horse shit show. Your work never had any value, and was simply artificially inflated like bcash.

While I don't believe counterfeit dollars are us dollars, I do not believe it is a scam. It's an altdollar with people trying to pump it up.

You can set the exact fee in electrum. I haven't tried but I see no reason why it wouldn't be confirmed

Immediately make a backup of your wallet.dat file to multiple locations.
Reformat the disk, resync the blockchain, open the wallet.dat file.

Total FUD. Website says plain as day withdrawal is explicitly permitted. Please remove your post. If I had not been up all night I would dig around and find it.

You're correct. By selling the 10 dollar coins for 5 dollars you realize 5 dollars loss, and you're making a bet that the 5 dollar coin will go up 100% to cover that loss. By taking fiat and buying new Bitcoin at 5 dollars to purchase the alt with you are long on both coins, but with no loss realized because you still hold the initial asset.

Afaik we don't have anything like that. We do have a bitpay card which let's you convert on deposit but not on purchase. Maybe we get a tenx card sometime soon but don't hold your breath

How would you respond to someone who says gold enables a black market? Seriously, ISIS , NK, and Russia have been caught stealing or using gold to get around sanctions. 
How would you respond to someone who says oil enables a black market? Seriously, ISIS , NK, and Russia have been caught stealing or using oil to get around sanctions. 
How would you respond to someone who says counterfeit fiat enables a black market? Seriously, ISIS , NK, and Russia have been caught stealing or using counterfeit fiat to get around sanctions.
