Biological populations that have excess resources tend to show exponential population growth. For example a colony of fungi in a forest with many decaying trees. Unlimited food, unlimited growth. Bitcoin is exhibiting growth very closely resembling exponential functions. Many new technologies that have a big impact on human history seem to show this same behavior.

You can buy thin aluminum business cards in any color you want on Amazon. Use something sharp to engrave the seed. Surround the seed card with two blank ones like a sandwich. You can put a dab of super glue on the 4 corners to attach them all together. Super cheap and easy

For small amounts, go to localbitcoins.com and find a seller you can meet in person. You meet in a public place, exchange cash and they release escrow which puts the bitcoins in you localbitcoin wallet. Then you can transfer it to your wallet. 
Another way is cash deposit at a bank. You find a seller on localbitcoins who offers this, and deposit cash into their bank account. You have to follow the instructions carefully though.
Do a lot of research before you do anything and read all the scam warnings you can because there are many out there.
Depending on your location a Bitcoin ATM is really easy to use but they are mostly found in major metro areas.

Learn about the difference between public key (probably what you entered) and private (secret) key. With a paper wallet you need to sweep the entire address when you transfer it. The private key is what allows you to actually move your btc.

Looking forward to the fuze x card. The fuze w is just a hardware wallet. The fuze x will allow you to spend cryptos like a debit card with (I think) real time exchange. Apparently it's still being developed but it should be out this year. In 2019 they'll have a fuze bio card which adds biometrics to the card. Cool stuff.

Can't withdraw btc to your own wallet means you never truly own it. The one main benefit of btc is you can have complete control over your btc with the private key.

I think the OTC markets are being exhausted much quicker and institutional demand is resorting to retail markets. They have auto buys setup periodically on exchanges to minimize their impact on the price.

Price will go up in the months following the halving event. Miners still need to sell btc to pay electric bills. After halving, less supply means more demand means higher price.

@_date: 2019-02-10 11:48:08
Save your time, money, and mental health. Don't day trade cryptos, you will get rekt. You won't profit as much if you compare it to just buying Bitcoin(BTC) and holding in a hardware wallet. Also, trading is more akin to gambling than investing, only you can choose what you want to do with your money. Never use non custodial wallets(web based), spv wallets(samourai wallet or mycelium) are ok but only meant for a hot wallet. Just make sure you backup your seed words after getting your Bitcoin in your wallet that you control. Store the seed backup in a safe physical place in person, never online or on computer unless you learn to encrypt it.

To everyone confused: this is normal Bitcoin bull market behavior. The market and Reddit sentiment were exactly the same in late 2017. Simple supply and demand of a scarce asset. Large players are constantly buying, trying not to move the market too much. But when more people start buying constantly, the price jumps because not many people are selling. Of course I could be totally wrong.

The scammer was appealing to your mom's emotions and empathy. There are a billion crypto scams out there. This one is called social engineering(getting someone to do something they normally wouldn't do). The only way for the layperson to invest in this industry is to buy Bitcoin(btc), transfer to your own wallet (non custodial, preferably hardware wallet), backup your seed and keep it safe. Avoid all alt coins, never keep coins on exchange.

If you tell your wife, and she divorces you, then she will own your BTC stash. If you don't tell your wife, and she divorces you, you still own your BTC stash. Never trust a woman. Especially when it comes to finances. One of the features of Bitcoin is censorship resistance. But to have the feature, you must be the only one who controls the keys. One solution is to create a living will with part of your seed and instructions of where to find the other part that you have written down somewhere and concealed.

I've noticed most women in the crypto space play the role of spokesperson or representative.

I don't want to make this out to be a women hating post, so I will say there are some female journalists who do a decent job providing news, but the reality is that most of the developers and business owners are male. This boils down to biological differences. Males are rational and logical, whereas females are emotionally driven and irrational thinkers.

They have an ico coming soon for their equity token. They are planning to give dividends for token holders making it one very unique company. Preico stage just ended.

You're not alone. It's easy to think short term "I could buy a new car! Cool!". But when you start thinking long term, you realize that same amount of bitcoin you could buy 10 cars in the future. I think if you can hold onto your btc collection, you'll be able to live off it for the rest of your life, but you need to be frugal. People who blow money are poor, people who save money are rich. You have the right mindset, only buy what is an absolute necessity: food and bills/rent.

Keto and Bitcoin go great together. Your brain performs better with fats as energy source and your mood is more constant without carbs causing your blood sugars to spike multiple times in one day. Low carb=more energy. The only carbs your body needs should be fiber carbs from veggies (but not starchy veggies like potatoes). I try to keep under 20g carbs a day.  Bitcoin is the future of money, keto is the future of food.

To gain trust in the bitcoin protocol, network, and its use as a currency you need to understand the whole picture. There are many factors that contribute to its value. There are two types of Bitcoin users: those who understand everything about it and therefore understands why it's valuable, and those who listen to other people that say it has value, and invest based on trusting others logic. You need to do more research and learn more before you start saying it's 'a currency for suckers'. This is a brand new technology that is a culmination of multiple technologies. If people are already placing a huge amount of value into this new and young technology, there must be a reason behind it. 
Watch some videos of Andreas Antonopoulas on YouTube, he is very effective at explaining to laypersons such as yourself.
