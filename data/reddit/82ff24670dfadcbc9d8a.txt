The market says other wise, price has gone down $50 more USD since I posted that.

Glad I am not one of them right now! I will be again in the near future though when I put my profits from the recent rally back into bitcoin at a very cheap cost!

Where did you learn economics at?

Or the PBOC investigates the exchange and finds mass corruption, price manipulation of the operators, and a fractional reserve of the amount of bitcoin they claim to have and the market sells off even more to lows we haven't seen since 2015.

Hope your vendor doesn't wake up and cancel your order due to volatility. It was happening the other day to a lot of buyers.

Right, just like the other day when Bobby Lee told us that everything was okay when the PBOC first announced they wanted to put regulations in place. You going to trust the exchange over the PBOC? Things can get much worse, and it likely will. Wait for an official announcement from the PBOC, that tweet from BTCC is as fake as their volume.

Actually it technically rose higher than it ever has, there are 4 million more coins in circulation than there was in 2013, the market cap was billions of dollars higher than it had ever been, which means it took a lot more capital to push the price to the recent high than it took in 2013. Also means there are 4 million more coins in circulation to dump on to the markets during times like this.

I agree, a good vendor would either take the loss and enjoy the positive PR they get from it or go into vacation mode during times of volatility. Both are good choices. This was an issue for many though the other day, there was a thread full of pissed off customers in about it.

Why not?

BTC is pretty overvalued right now IMO. Good luck.

You should always wait for 3 confirmations before considering it final. Do not trust unconfirmed transactions.
