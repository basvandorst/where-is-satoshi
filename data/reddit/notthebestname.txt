If the government wants, nothing is too big to fail. Trust me. Until the country itself fails.
Remind me in 2 years to see if Deutsche bank failed.
In our country banks actually fail, Deutsche bank is far from it.

How many of your friends/family/co-workers have a good backup system for their documents or family photo's? Or for that matter, a good password system for their accounts?
Bitcoin needs to address the human issue if it really wants to succeed.
@_date: 2019-11-18 08:18:10
Just so I get this right.
If it gets stolen, lost or it breaks you lose your money?
Guys, BTC will NEVER be used by people if it is like this.
@_date: 2019-03-03 07:34:31
Their currency is not the problem...

I've been following this sub for years out of interest.
I thought it might be adopted at a wide scale for every day payments. But I do not think that is possible the way it is. If you can't trust hot wallets or exchanges and you need expertise and a risk appetite to keep currency on you then it will always just be a way of sticking money under your pillow.
Still important for hedging against my shit currency and maybe making payments overseas if I need to fuck out of my shit country.

My only point is that I know more than the people around me - and that's not enough for me to use it. I am the kind of people you need to convince. If I didn't get it, you are doing it wrong. And that needs to change.
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:59:52


Nope, I don't. My friends even less, and family even less.


A bank is not a single point of failure, having all your money lost because of a spelling mistake or hack or broken wallet or single password is a single point of failure. Banks are protected by governments, contracts and policies. As I have said before, I have had money hacked, it was no issue to the bank. Banks in my country went bankrupt, the government intervened and paid the people back. In a functioning country this is fine. Is btc only useful in a non-functioning country/world?
I live in a country / society that is corrupt and broken and very rapidly going down. I NEED something like btc to become viable. It isn't.
I don't know what I want, but I do know that right now I can easily pay a merchant at a local market for a coke using my banking app. It's been a decade and crypto is not on the path to make this more doable. My country has a better shot. My point is, even if all of this is secure, easy, useful and trustworthy, it's not viable and working and I have to find other ways.
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:28:31
So based on the replies, the wallet can be backed up, either with a seed phrase or an actual backup and it is encrypted with a strong password.
Yea, I still don't see how this will be adopted over the current fiat  / bank / app / mobile QR payment system that is used where I live.
Because I don't need to be sitting on my money like a dragon protecting and backing it up - I trust the bank and the country and when I get hacked I have always gotten my money back no problem because of bank policies.
I don't think the effort of owning independent money is worth it. I prefer my society thanks.
@_date: 2019-08-23 08:17:29
Not really no, there is some paperwork for a donation like this - but guaranteed security.
Btc will HAVE to solve this issue.
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:02:45
It's strange. I live in Africa. Most people are banked. And those that arnt, arnt because of a lack of access to technology and the internet. You should see the queue a at ATM's. Because people have to do what most people do on app's at the ATM once a week.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:42:41
Yea, I see all your points. But you have no clue, no probability, no evidence, no value, no history, no precursor, no sample size, no confidence, no model, no accuracy assessment. Absolute sweet fuck all to back you up in crypto currency.
Social media sentiment? Electricity prices in Mongolia? Moors law? Gold standard? Global economic policy? Public sentiment? payment competition? Future geopolitical risk? You have a verified model for those things? 
It is not the same as investing in a company that produces cars or software or a nation state's currency. It's gambling. You make money when the price goes up for no fucking reason at all. What, we love Facebook and their privacy policy so much that Bitcoin deserve to gain on some headline?
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:44:47
But it is.
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:00:17
Cold storage....is not the point of BTC...
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:43:38
You guys know this is gambling right?
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:43:58
That's gambling. You are making a prediction and betting on it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:42:24
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:36:30
Yea, its TOTALLY not a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2019-12-14 04:02:41
You make literally no sense. As I asked. What industry is wasting energy by not adding value ? Are they just buying electricity and dumping it into the ground?
And what, or course you lose energy during transport, just like you would to a Bitcoin farm not built at the source. But you waste very little. Not enough to justify pumping it into silicon and fans.
@_date: 2019-12-14 04:03:03
Not suffer a 51%?
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:17:15
You're not serious right?
So you would say there's no point diversifying an investment geographically and it's better to just keep it in one province in China. You are saying there is zero risk in nation states? The very thing Bitcoin is suppose to subvert by being a global currency?
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:17:15
Zimbabweans do not have the tech expertise or money to store digital tokens securely. Bitcoin works in countries where people have smart houses. Zimbabwe mostly doesn't have water or power.
I am in South Africa and I would love to get off my currency except no tech that I have is mine, I run on the assumption that I will be robbed and have good insurance, no one will insure local cold bitcoins

Hey, don't judge, this is cutting edge science this man is doing.
@_date: 2019-12-18 10:06:35
Well. That would be 100% accurate then.
Your argument is stupid. Why would lies be better than nothing? It's not. It's worse. If you KNOW you know nothing you can make good decisions based on that. If you think you know something but you don't your decisions will be worse.

No. Weather isn't predicted by patterns or log scale interpolation or whatever the fuck this is. Weather is predicted by numerical and physical modelling of the state of the atmosphere using physial principles of conservation of energy, mass  etc. The models are fed observational data from millions of monitoring systems in space, on land and underwater and they are calibrated and evaluated by these measurements daily. 
Model calibration does include statistics and data fitting. But it most definitely is not still based on "last Christmas was 32 degrees so this one is likely to be the same plus the trend of a log transform of the curve through the last 10 Christmases according to a angle I scaled with values pulled from my butt.

Not me.

I know how super resolution works. Which is why that video is bullshit. You can increase your sharpness and collect more light but to zoom in like that video without better lenses is not possible.
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:19:33
What industry subtracts value by using power?
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:53:42
This is 100% not physically possible using a phone sized lens and aperture. Nevermind with unstabalised video!
No matter how many times that moon shot aticle misuses the term AI it is just a filter and you cannot make up resolution...except of course by googling your subject and stealing from there.
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:29:07
Zimbabwe turned their internet off...
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:02:01
Because its all hype!
@_date: 2019-01-31 11:06:43
Bullshit. Crypto develops itself ?
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:14:37
Economists would never predict a 1000% increase.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:10:49
Bit what if your bro mounts a 51%... no more buddies to trade with :'(
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:49:51
And it does nothing that a central bank does.
@_date: 2019-05-06 12:33:43
WW2 was essentially a global was due to colonialism. We won't do that again.
@_date: 2018-12-29 13:49:19
40%... 600 million people in that huge diverse country. Doubt it.
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:27:21
But is it though?
Or is that the dream the fills the bubble?
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:08:21
Yea. You and your 7 buddies that own the rest can play cards with it then. While your bro is mining to confirm the winnings in the basement.
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:48:35
Mine? The one that  are the internet possible? I like it.
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:56:56
No it's not.
He invests in real assets.
And then he crashes lambos and laughs because he doesn't have insurance.
@_date: 2019-05-06 09:52:19
The thing about the world though... It is run by organisations. Of which governments are one of the highest levels. And money is used as a tool to controll the system. And we do need the system.
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:23:09
"Infrastructure" 
The internet, sime code and some inflated graphics card prices?
@_date: 2018-12-30 05:21:30
"No banks that control your money"
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:10:12
Iam here to watch it sink. And learn.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:23:09
But it doesn't. 
It's all China and mining groups and GPU prices and its extremely uncertain.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:39:03
Look. Mining can never be effiecient. That is the entire point if mining. To be hard. The dream of anything else is just that.
Also. It kind of takes away from the whole beauty of the immutable ledger money idea sold to the masses if you need to sell them the fact that they wont be actually using the ledger to buy their tshirt.
@_date: 2018-12-14 06:03:54
Going down again!
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:15:06
Yes.... if it was an asset. It's a technology. In 4 years it might be heading to where Myspace, Facebook and google+ is headed. 
Even if blockchains integrates into society. It's not bitcoin.
