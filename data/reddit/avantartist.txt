Down with the farms!  Bring the mining back to the people.

Thanks for the hot tip.  I’m off to sodl. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:24:14
That would be interesting to see.  I’m feeling 2k

I had 1btc over at gox when they halted withdrawals but was never able to claim it through the bankruptcy.  
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:33:07
That sucks.

Of course I’ve been waiting for the correction since 3k.

My advice is to never go all in or all out.  Pick an amount that works for you and buy A little bit weekly.

ASIC’s...  the best and worst thing to ever happen to BTC.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:29:59
I’m so excited for the $4k moon memes

They should make sound machines.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:24:10
Anyone have the backstory here?  I can understand why a mining farm wouldn’t want to sell outdated machines, technically it just creates competition, and herein lies how BTC has strayed from the true value.  
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:49:55
Probably

I forgot to hodl.  Had a bunch of btc and was stoked to sell it for a modest down payment on a house.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:49:04
I have no idea what you’re talking about. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:13:44
It’s a great way to learn markets for future investment and how to read indicators.  Pick a strategy if you’re going to be a hodl or trader.  
My best advice is to spread out your position.

We’re better off without crypto ETF’s.  I personally don’t believe one will be approved for many years to come.
