Ah, you've made the same mistake as the Germans. So focused on controlling inflation and purchasing power you forget about the rest of the system.
My original point still stands, as Germany's economy significantly contracted between 1934 and 1945 and is not considered a success under any measure.

On the contrary, numerous brilliant ideas throughout history have been ruined because they forgot to account for the human behavior.
Airline crash investigations always include a human factors expert, because so many accidents have been caused by pilots behaving irrationally.
Contrary to common sense, people often buy into a market near it's peek and sell off as it goes down. See the latest Bitcoin boom in December...
People, when presented with facts contradicting information they heard earlier are likely to dismiss the new facts and become more entrenched in their beliefs.
Heck, a quick Google search will show you tons of great ideas that did nothing. Just because something is great on paper doesn't mean it's going to work the same way out in a world filled with irrational people.

That has nothing to do with inflation and everything to do with the global markets, including labor. Post WWII Europe and Asia were ravaged by war and it took decades for their production infrastructure and working age populations to recover. Since there was a labor shortage, workers were able to demand higher salaries. Something similar happened in Europe after the black death.
Now that the labor pool is global and Europe and Asia have matched our infrastructure we no longer enjoy our privileged position. Also that guy pumping gas while his wife stayed at home didn't live in as big of a house, drive as many miles, and have all the modern appliances we have today. That cheap labor pool in Asia is allowing us to fill our homes with iPads, giant TVs, and other appliances gas station guy could only dream of.
Also, inflation adjusted minimum wage never passed $11.00: 
So take off your rose colored nostalgia glasses grand-paw, there has never been a better time to be alive.

Dwolla is free for transactions under $10
If I want to get USD out of Coinbase it's 1%
Clients who pay me more than $5k at a time have always written a check and there are no fees for that.
The super micro transactions are intresting, but with Dwolla I can do penny transactions for free.
And I don't mean to use Dwolla over and over but it's a good example of a simple low fee direct to US cash system THAT I STILL CANT GET MY FUCKING CUSTOMERS TO SIGN UP FOR EVEN IF I GIVE THEM A DISCOUNT, because it's an extra step to move money into Dwolla, and people are lazy! 
This is also why I'm highly skeptical of wide spread Bitocoin adoption. I just don't see most people going through the steps required to create a wallet, secure it, and buy Bitcoins. Expecially when there are alternative services offering faster transaction times, easier setup, and deals on in a currency they've spent their entire lives using.

We both referred to it as a tax... I'm not sure what you mean in your reply.

What is the benefit of Bitcoin over something like Dwolla? That's part of what Buffett is saying, that has to be directly tied to the dollar to work, "which means that it is not a currency in and of itself".
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:14:51
Exactly my issue with it, it's so new that there's no history similarities to look back on and make reasonable predictions about it's future.
I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin ends up getting replaced with an improved crypto-currency in the next few years.

I find it hilarious that you used Germany in 1945 as good example for a deflationary economy. You may want to give this a read:
Also I'm having trouble finding anything good about the Nazi German economy. Price controls, rationing, and huge tax burdens:

Average income in 1913: $800 yr
Average income in 2013: $26,364 yr
Cost of a 1913 4 lb steak: $1
Cost of a 2013 4 lb steak: $7.16
Number of steaks one could buy in 1913: 800
Number of steaks one could buy in 2013: 3682
And the 1808 coffee... that could take a day or more to earn...
The increase in wages, production, and distribution has more than compensated for inflation. These graphics are horribly misleading.

a) Not if you got in around December
b) Why not just use something like Dwolla then?
c) That's another thing, if the price and usage keep going up, won't it be weird making .0000036 BTC purchases?
d) Yes but all those services can be easily utilized by laymen, in many cases they don't even know they are using it. If the process of setting up and securing wallets  and buying your first bitcoin could be streamlined then maybe this wouldn't be such a factor. But even if it was, why use it over other currency exchanges? (see b)

Except you are totally wrong. Minimum wage may not be as high as it was in the mid 1960s, but that's to be expected with the post WWII recovery and the rise of labor from Asia. It's also far better than it was prior to the 1960s or before there was a minimum wage at all. Overall wages, especially for skilled labor, have kept pace with inflation. You also have to account for increases in productivity and the global supply network. The average worker can buy far more goods than any other time in history.
Also, employers don't increase wages on a "whim", labor is just like any other commodity and is subject to the same supply and demand forces. Case and point, over the summer I needed some extra help on a project and sent a request for interns to a local university. My first per hour offer was on the low end and the response was lukewarm. I increased the per hour compensation and sent another letter. The next week we were inundated with applicants.
Finally, inflation discourages the hording of money and has other positive effects on long term debt like student loans, mortgages, and foreign debt. I too used to think that inflation was entirely bad, but after watching Bitcoin and how a deflationary currency encourages hording and the concentration of wealth, I've changed my mind.

Are you kidding!? This this is the one of the most entertaining communities I've ever been able to interact with. There's debates about economics, psychology, ethics, regulation, security, programming, and on and on. It's not about Bitcoin, but what Bitcoin represents and brings out in people. And the fact is, no one knows how this will end... or go on. 
The other night I debated many aspects of the currency with a die hard Bitcoin proponent friend of mine. We spent hours methodically debating everything listed above until his girlfriend literally drug him out.
Edit: Look at this thread! The top comment suggests that dissenters are part of a conspiracy to undermine the community, other comments think there are people here mad about losing money on MtGox or are jealous of not getting in early, and finally you have the good old "they're just haters". Just reading how this community deals with dissent is endlessly entertaining.
Edit 2: Also let me clarify: Do I think a large number of people will be using a cryto based currency one day? Possibly. Do I think it will be Bitcoin. Most certainly not.

Two serious questions:
1) Can you give me a historical example where deflation of a currency resulted in a better economy?
2) In a deflationary economy what happens to long term consumer debt such as student loans, mortgages, and credit cards?

ATM withdrawal limits, physical security systems backed by surveillance and police, you can cancel payment check. There's a reason these things exist. With Bitcoin it's back to the Wild West.

Show me a 40 year old who can't afford a house. Something must have gone catastrophic wrong in their lives. Only a few years ago a very frugal coworker bought his first house at 20 using a VA loan, some cash he saved while deployed to Iraq, and a $15 an hour job.
For example using this calculator, a single earner at $15 an hour can afford around $118,926. Which picking a random city like Springfield, IL shows thousands of homes for that price or under:
Wages have increased as well as the affordability of goods (pointed out many other times in this thread):
So you are flat out wrong. I do agree that a small group of people have seen a disproportionate benefit from the amazing gains in productivity over the last 40 years and minimum wage has stagnated, but this isn't due to fiat and most certainty won't be solved by Bitcoin (in fact the opposite appears to be true):

The first source covers deflationary policies as a reaction to the hyperinflation of the 1920s and it's detrimental effects.
The second cites how the Nazis had a unsustainable command economy, along with some inflation.
Your argument that the Nazi economy was brilliant, right up until it collapsed, is ridiculous. Many economic instruments looked great at first, then they proved to be unsustainable; the housing bubble, the dot-coms, the Japanese asset price bubble, Nazi Germany, and now Bitcoin.
Also you source is not readily available online, so it won't do anything to further this discussion. And I have to note that it was written in January 1, 1938 and provides no historical perspective. It's kind of like reading a book on how great an investment the housing market is... written in 2006.

I'm interested in Bitcoin, but there is no way my business would ever accept it due to the volatility. I need a stable, predictable, means of exchanging my services and products for rent, salaries, and other operating expenses. While "volatility" may be good and exciting for speculators, it's a death sentence for businesses seeking a reliable rate of exchange. This is why Bitcoin fails at what should be the most basic function of a currency.
You make another good point, the general population "don't even know 2% of how it works". Even after you've made your impassioned pitch. It's a fatal flaw for widespread adoption, and with more and more people in the Bitcoin community starting to sound like Amway sales people I'm starting to think 10 years from now Bitcoin will be remembered as just another Tulip mania.

You seem to be confusing inflation with hyperinflation. Controlled inflation is essential to growing an economy.


Inflation is a larger tax on the rich, since they have more deprecating assets and currency... Removing inflation also discourages them from investing which historically has a had catastrophic effect on the lower class.




I think you are letting conspiracy theories and misinformation cloud your judgement. You honestly sound like a climate change denier, who thinks the scientific community has some hidden agenda. You should really take a step back and read some of the other side's arguments:

Ding ding ding! We have a winner! 
It would suck to try and start a business, buy a tractor for the farm, or get cash to survive a sudden loss in business. Only the already wealthy would have access to the assets required to run a business.
Not to mention common folk would be force to save before making a purchase. "Man! I love to go to work but I have to pay the full purchase price of this car!"

I'm actually amazed at how many people thought I was being sarcastic. Everyone seems to have read their own beliefs into my short post. I don't think any of them actually read the article. As for me, I was into many libertarian ideas until I heard about this incident where Friedman's ideas were given free rein and the results were damning:
"The so-called "monetarist experiment" which lasted until 1982 in its pure form, has been the object of much controversy, but few have claimed it to be a success...The most conspicuous feature of the post 1973 period is that of considerable instability...no firm and consistent upward trend (to say the least)."
"According to United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean data the percentage of Chilean population living in poverty rose from 17% in 1969 to 45% in 1985."
There's also a very good documentary on the subject which shows how bad it was for the poor during that period, but I haven't seen it for years.
