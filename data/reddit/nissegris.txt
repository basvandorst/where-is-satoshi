Nodes are increasing and those are not fake. Stop being a FUDster.

That's a use case. The tx does not need to be stuck. . A more likely use case is to send the transaction back to yourself. It's like having a charge-back button in your wallet.

This thread is so sad. What kind of crowd has this subreddit attracted? 
I'm sorry to see you go Mike. Thanks for your efforts!

From the article:
"However, Segregated Witness will only give us something like an 80 percent capacity increase, and hard forks take a long time to deploy. The hard fork needs to be readied, and roll-out started quickly after. **While I’d prefer it if Bitcoin Core does that, it appears Bitcoin Classic is the leading option for deploying a hard fork. As such, we do support that project.**"

How high miner fee will you pay? If there are 20 seats in the bus and there are 25 people that want to travel, how high are you willing to try to outbid the other passengers for a seat? That's the issue

Because most that came into Bitcoin expected it to be able to handle more than 3tx/s. That's a given. 
Except it isn't anymore. It's not useful anymore.

Those improvements have nothing to do with decision-making. It's a no-brainer to pick libsecp256k1 over OpenSSL and reviewing code vs. not reviewing code.
