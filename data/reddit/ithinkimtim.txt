Well said!  Except I feel like the average person shouldn't have to "get it", something has to change to make it easier.

Yeah and some postal delivery services don't.  Just like how some emails comeback with a delivery failure notification.  Or you know, if it's something important you can instantly contact the person or company to ask if they got it. 
I don't really understand your argument here?  Like, yeah post can have delivery confirmation or whatever, but I don't think that's high enough on most people's priority list when choosing to send a physical copy of something.
And if your mail server is having that much trouble in 2014, you should change, or just be glad it isn't as much of a failure as my local post office ;)

Don't do the condescending anti liberal arts jerk.  Ignorance and laziness has nothing to do with what someone chooses to study.

Maybe that could be a solution, accepting bitcoin at the same times as credit cards.

I got 7 bitcoins in 2011 as a ~$100 Christmas present from the boss.  Glad I didn't get a choice or I may have gone down that path.

I think I saw that.  Can't remember if it was most active subscribers or something similar.

Pretty much everything in the tiniest budget short films is put there intentionally by a production designer, whether it has any symbolic meaning or is just there to fill the scene.  It's not an unreasonable question to ask when talking about a major TV show.

So much of the bitcoin community, I'd even guess a majority, are in it for the investment.
Which sucks balls.  I want this cool idea to be widespread and useful.  When most of the community is waiting for it to be adopted so they can make money, not so that the world will benefit from the technology, it's not a good community to be in.
I want to hear more about how great bitcoin is, not about how much it's worth.

I still think it's avoiding the question.  Bitcoin is so often advertised as fee free but for the average user there is often a cost to transactions.   Cash doesn't have that problem, neither does any transfer from my bank nationally.   It's something that needs to be addressed or stop being blasted as a feature that makes it better than fiat.
As for overseas transfers, bitcoin all the way.

I've lost a lot more post in my life than emails.  But I think we prefer post because you can post things.  Post.

My thoughts exactly.  But Nokia in the 90s would have been a good investment if you saw when to drop out.  ~~Maybe~~ something will come along and be better than bitcoin but for now bitcoin is king.

Doesnt change the point.

[My favourite Australian invention](  The colours though... debatable.
Edit: Forgot about wifi.  Besides wifi.

Yeah and the more I think about it the yellow of 50s is so rewarding.  And then that rare greedy green 100.  The hardest thing about switching to bitcoin is going to be losing all these pretty colours.

Extra extra read all about it: Book that records the meaning of English words adds English words.

The animator and writer both work for the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Company) and were on a TV show called "Hungry Beast", where they did segments with animations like this to explain all sorts of modern news and tech.
I miss that show.

That doesn't degrade his journalism in other fields if he likes to write in fashion...

That's a good question.  Will have to check my next payslip.

So true.  I even resort to trying to explain it to them with that stuff.
"You know about bitcoin?"
"Bitcoin, you know the digital currency"
"You know... the one with all the controversy about drugs and hiring hitmen?"
"Nope"
