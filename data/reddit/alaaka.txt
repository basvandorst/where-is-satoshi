Unsure about what you're trying to show me here..
It's just another API.
What about the concept? 
Is there an app / software that can perform what i described?
If there was one, do you think people would want it?

Thank you for that answer, appreciated.
I'm still very new to the whole bitcoin concept(as untraceable and hot/cold storage).
This is my idea:
Having a server that receives a request:
- The request doesn't have any limits. What it basically does is calculate the transfer costs between wallets based on an algorithem that computes timeXwallet_amounts.
The higher the time = More wallets.
So when you put your public info in some wallet and fund it, you then send that wallet money to my server.
Then the server will start creating wallets and transfers between those wallets.
When suddenly you want to use your money, that server holds all the wallets you have, so you can create a multi-transfer of the money from many different wallets through that server.
Example: You put 1BTC originally, and after 20 days that money lost 0.0075BTC(assumption, i don't know the charges for transfers).
You then wish to pay/transfer the money to your account, your UNIQUE(received from server) code will allow you to request that and transfer all that money to your new wallet / pay another wallet.
So it will include:
1. Not 1 wallet but several, to maintain anonymity and hard-to-trace transfers.
2. Random timed and server-maintained wallets to transfer in between so your money remains untraced.
Sounds good so far?
I figure it's not very hard to write, considering all the APIs around and being able to create paper wallets locally.

I also wonder if it's in any way illegal?
Creating fake transactions?
Or having your server pay some wallet that basically belongs to an illegal vendor?
