Thanks for posting this. I too have fear about new people showing up my bitcoin meetup meetings. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 10:39:20
I'll be at the one on Saturday! 
@_date: 2014-04-22 11:47:21
I will be there.  :)

President 0bama is not a king and can not make any currency a national currency. We have this thing called "Congress" who can do that, but then watch the Federal Reserve, who is a PRIVATE entity, start picking off politicians who vote against the current money system... Look at JFK.

You can always buy face to face from a person. Where are you from?

Yeah I'm deeply disappointed in these guys. They competed against their customers and drastically helped to push up the difficulty to screw us over. I did own a few of their miners in the past. They would have been nothing without we the customer. Now they have their monster mining warehouse.

For $5, free shipping. :)

Net neutrality is a ruse to get government involved with regulating the Internet.  I don't want government touching anything in regards to the Internet. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:36:21
You should move to a much better state like Ohio. We have been spreading the word of bitcoin very well here.  We have much better college sports than that state up north as well. :) 
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:39:17
This is awesome! I'm in for one. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:34:01
I may go to the Bitcoin Bowl this year. Tickets recently went on sale. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:03:27
I haven't had to turn on my furnace yet this fall. ;) This is the nice side effect of mining during the cooler part of the year. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:38:20
Trailer Park Boys is an awesome show. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:28:55
Www.Cryptothrift.com is a place where I've seen them as well. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:55:10
Screw government "Task Forces"...  There is no need for any intervention or regulation needed in bitcoin. When a government decides they want to "regulate"something, they want to control it.... In the old days the true definition of regulate was "to make regular".
@_date: 2014-10-25 22:23:35
Thank you! There is no need for Bitcoin to be "regulated". There is no way to regulate Bitcoin. You can only regulate the exchanges, and that is about it. Watch the government make it illegal to exchange BTC for fiat currency and then conduct undercover operations to catch people just how they send out cops to pose as drug dealers and prostitutes. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:05:58
Because we live here and we are doing our part to spread the word about Bitcoin and its revolutionary ways in the financial world.

KnC was the best until they missed their Neptune deadline and then screwed some of us by shipping out a horribly designed 3TH Super Jupiter with used equipment from their hashing datacenter.
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:43:48
The owner said he's currently working on it. It will be available soon.
@_date: 2014-04-22 10:16:42
I have used Crypto Thrift ever since the demise of BitMit and never really had any issues with the site. I've also requested refunds a few times from escrow from new sellers who didn't come through and didn't have a problem getting my btc back. You just need to keep your eyes open and double check your refund address twice to be sure you know where the finds are going. I have been very pleased overall with the site. They have grown and improved a great deal over the past few months. Please stop crying wolf over your one little incident of a scam. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:43:14
Let the free market sort this out...
@_date: 2014-07-17 10:37:36
The term "non-profit" is the biggest joke ever for most  organizations that boast about being non-profit. Look at the wages of the head(s) of the organizations at some of those "non-profits". 
@_date: 2014-04-28 11:57:56
Why do you think I'm always drinking.  ;)
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:28:20
I don't trust "smart" meters. They will be used to control energy usage by entities outside of your private residence. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:11:12
You don't need credit to move an economy... Something called a "savings" can be built first then you can spend.... Now if we could hey government to stop taxing is to death, we would have more personal wealth to spend on things, thus making the economy much better for everyone and make everyone richer.  
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:46:12
Try bitstamp
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:20:52
This increases the supply of BTC that can be freely moved around.  This can only drive the price down a little bit. If these auctions go for too low below the spot price that will be another indicator to drive the price down. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 12:00:08
I'll be there! May 1st! :)
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:37:27
Haha Screw Apple! My Samsung Galaxy S5 worked very well in that transaction with the Blockchain.info app. :)
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:46:06
I picked one up, but was never prompted to pay with bitcoin even though I had selected the option. Also nothing on how to pay with bitcoin arrived in the order confirmation email either. I'll contact them tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:07:19
So with the damn "regulations"! It's just the government's way to take their cut. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:19:00
I still see bitcoin as an available payment option.
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:45:07
Sell your preorder spot and run from BFL. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 11:44:33
Nice article. Further down the rabbit hole I go. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 13:12:54
Good! F*** them!
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:50:43
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:26:36
CryptoThrift.com is my alternative. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 12:23:25
I'm very happy he's mentioning bitcoin. He talks about it more and more on his radio show every week now. He has such a large audience and this is good for publicity. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 21:46:10
Typical of Maryland. They are a nanny state just like California, and New York. Keep serving us that Kool Aid big government...
@_date: 2014-08-18 03:34:11
Yeah I received it too. I'm not falling for that lame crap! 
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:45:26
Awesome! I saw them a few times. I like them. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:25:21
This is why I knew it would be best to convert my order to the 3TH Jupiter kit. .. To hold out until probably June would have been more risky. Unless KnC actually delivers a 4.5TH Neptune, I think I made the best choice. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:07:32
It's interesting how the local news article doesn't even bring up Butterfly Labs since Josh is the CEO or owner of whatever. .. That company is horrible!

There is no way to regulate bitcoin! Government, stop trying! Your endless fiat currency printing ways are over! 
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:40:55
There's more than just that on there... It the best thing we got since BitMit is gone. I've been with CryptoThrift ever since BitMit shut down and I've been happy with it overall. The website has made many improvements in recent months.
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:59:25
I'm a part of the Cleveland Bitcoin Meet up group,  it has grown well ever since July 2013. We were a part of the Bitcoin Boulevard US event this evening in Cleveland Heights led by Nikhil of coinneo.com . Nine businesses participated in the event and we're all within less than 1 km of each other.

I know someone who bought 4 of their scrypt based miners. I helped him get up and running because they sent him his 4 boxes with essentially no usable image on the raspberry pi's that were in them. I luckily found some other mining company that essentially used that same ASIC chips and layout, and used their pi image to at least get him hashing. They also sent him his gear many months late.

A "Democracy" leads to mob rule. I prefer to avoid such things. I prefer nice small republics. Just my two cents.

Buy a Netflix gift card with btc.

Talk to a mining host company,  like Bitcoin Breeze. They can handle running your miner and you don't even have to think about it. I know them very well. I'm about to have them host my Black Arrow Prospero X-3. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:46:25
Who cares? ...
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:03:38
I prefer the flat tax plan, because once you get politicians involved, they'll recode what is "fair"...
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:55:20
Now if Ohio would get their heads out of their asses....
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:18:43
I use CryptoThrift. That site has been the one I've using ever since the demise of BitMit. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:35:15
I look so good in my Blockchain.info t-shirt. That chocolate was very good. Had some chocolate covered pretzels. The Bitcoin Boulevard US event was a great time!
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:54:20
