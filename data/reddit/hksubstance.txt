Ask your older sibling
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:47:29
Which kind?
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:42:58
I strongly advice him to attain legal age.
Afterwards, he should not invest money in bitcoin.

Ask your parents!
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:38:07
Well shit, ask your older cousin

There’s potential value in finances with Blockchain technology. That can be said with certainty.
However, bitcoin fails to deliver on that purported value. Currently, nothing exists that would actually incentivize me or average Joe to switch from cash to bitcoin. Can’t pay for rent or food with it anyways.
And those who are trying to use the actual advertised function of currency are getting slammed with ridiculous transaction fees and waiting times.
The only thing driving the price now is speculation. There’s going to be a well designed coin that will eventually find actual adoption by society and realize the cryptocurrency value, but the chances of it being bitcoin are pretty slim.
When that happens bitcoin will be rendered useless. People will realize that duh, merely holding virtual tokens in a wallet won’t solve the biggest hurdle which is actual adoption by the average Joe.

Did you make a profit?
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:52:55
Not buying anything is the obvious option here
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:49:56
Sure! Blackmailing your parents is surely beneficial...

If you think Bitcoin is more useful now than one year ago, you’re extremely mistaken.
Bitcoin‘s value is supposed to be how more convenient, more useful it is than money.
However, say I want to purchase 30 usd of something today with bitcoin. The transaction fees and waiting time now are much higher than a year ago. It‘s actually less desirable as a currency than a year ago.

Yeah, ppl need to take advantage and buy below 7k before it goes back to 6k!

Well said
If it doesn’t start doing something better than Fiat that would make the average person switch .. soon ppl will realize they’re holding onto a bunch of binary collectibles, lol.
The market value will react accordingly ��

The exchange might just tell you that 10% of your money has disappeared, soon
