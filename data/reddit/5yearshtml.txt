I think its foolish to assume that Goldman hasn't been paying very close attention to BTC for years now. In fact it's more likely than not that they would intentionally deceive people into think they weren't pro Bitcoin up until this point.

Bitcoin shouldn't facilitate your anarchic attitudes. The IRS is fine.

Well he did, and they are...

Bitcoin prices are much more susceptible to price manipulation than global markets.

This is all great but even the most tech savvy amongst us have gotten their coins stolen. Good luck getting mass adoption.

Ya crypto going from 19k to 3k in a year+ is totally more viable.

Everyone said the Second Era started when Mt.gox fell. Now there's a steady rally and everyone is out and about going "YOU SEE I TOLD YOU BITCOIN IS THE REVOLUTION THIS IS THE TIME!!!!!

Unhackable yet incredibly difficult to secure.

lol this sub takes itself way to seriously.

Lol Peter Brandt is a best selling trading book author with over 40 years of fundamental and technical analytics and trading experience. So maybe not some guy who just got lucky?

Then neither do the conclsuions you draw from the comparison.

"Investigative techniques" refer to redactions made in order to prevent revealing the means used to obtain the relevant data.
I'm curious as to what was redacted and why. It seems like a very short segment and its directly prior to the mention of a bitcoin mining operations used to secure funding for hacking equipment. 
Interested in hearing your thoughts.
Edit: report goes on to mention that the group kept its mined bitcoins in an account on CEX.io. 
Just wanted to chime for all the people who think that the government is clueless with Bitcoin. The investigators were not only able to determine who was mining the Bitcoins but also what exchange these coins were being held on.

Assuming this is a one day chart it shows next to nothing. The S&amp;P is down almost 2% today obviously some of the constituents which comprise the index will be down. Moreover this doesn't make a strong case for BTC being negatively correlated with the market. We're up .35% in response to the biggest market drop in over a month.

There is no probability involved here. When fears of interest hikes cause a large market sell you will always see stocks sell across the board.

This isn't necessarily a good thing for a currency

Are there any known wallet addresses belonging to satoshi? 
@_date: 2016-09-27 18:29:39
Ohhh look more people on this sub who know next to nothing about finance.
@_date: 2016-09-27 21:54:55
Didn't know you lived on the utopian bitcoin island. Forgot you guys had your own self sustaining economy completely free from all risk.
@_date: 2016-09-28 13:29:58
But i thought Cryptocurrency is the safe alternative!
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:01:46
Why do you assume Satoshi is a single person
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:57:33
I've been a bitcoin supporter for a very very long time however I find your ideas of the future to be very misplaced. From the  practical stand point of usage bitcoin is a bitcoin is a disaster. Tech savy individuals get their coins stolen all the time imagine teaching your grandmother how to use a wallet and keeping it secure. I never understood people who think bitcoin Is the be all end all.

Sure it's stupid but unfortunately  it's the law. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:56:00
This is good for bitcoin.

I don't think you understand or truly appreciate how insignificant 1 billion is relative to a trillion
