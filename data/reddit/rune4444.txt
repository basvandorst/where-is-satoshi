I don't think pow has failed or that miner centralization is a huge problem (although a KYC whitelist soft fork wouldn't be pretty), but it's also wrong to say PoS hasn't been tested. There's been NXT, NEM, BTS, STEEM and many others, most of which have been solid for years and consistently had top cryptocurrency market caps.

Why do you buy bitcoin in the first place?
BitShares/BitUSD isn't a website, it's another blockchain. bitUSD are tokens that work just like bitcoin, but have a stable value (without counterparty risk). There are many other Market Pegged Assets like it, and BitShares is mainly meant as a decentralized exchange where you e.g. can trade bitUSD vs bitBTC on the blockchain, and then transfer out through a gateway to real BTC once you're done trading. Bitcoin addresses are even compatible with the bitshares network to make it even more convenient to transfer money between the systems.
Bitshares will give bitcoin and all other blockchains a decentralized exchange that works just as quickly, but has much more privacy and is more secure than a regular centralized exchange. If it gains enough liquidity then we can never be goxed again.
@_date: 2014-12-18 11:56:28
Yeah, I agree with you. I don't think it's "technically" centralized, but the idea that a single entity want to own 70% of what they are pitching as a potential global reserve currency is disgustingly greedy, and will turn off a lot of people.
But there's no denying that the system is incredibly useful for currency transfer and trading. That's why I think the only option is to support systems that has the same function but doesn't have shitty distribution and is properly decentralized. They should be able to compete properly with ripple where bitcoin can't, and ensure XRP doesn't end up becoming the backbone currency.
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:56:48
There will be a place for bitcoin too. Bitcoin is the first blockchain and has an impeccable security record (which is why I'm not a big fan of sidechains since they could jeopardize this). If cryptocurrencies become global standard, bitcoin will have significant value the same way PM does. A precious blockchain.

I know that the next step in your bitcoiner denialism is to link to the old article describing the nothing at stake problem and how that supposedly makes POS inherently flawed.
Back in the day I'd have to explain to you how that problem is solved in DPOS and other advanced POS systems and this would devolve into a long discussion of me trying to explain to you how DPOS works, and you ignoring what I say while denying that anything other than POW can ever work.
Luckily nowadays I won't even have to do that, I can just refer you to vitaliks blog where he explains in simplified terms how to solve the nothing at stake problem both for short range attacks (block producer bonds) and long range attacks (checkpoints received from your trust network, the same way you download the client). DPOS already solved this 6 months ago so it's nothing new though.
You desperately want it to be true that POS is "inherently unviable" because you already know that if it turns out not to be the case then your bitcoins are worthless in the long term. So I don't expect anything to be able to break your blind conviction just yet. But you have to at least accept that not everyone will be as stubborn as you, slowly but surely people who are able to objectively look at the facts will trickle out of the bitcoin community and into the new communities, just like vitalik did, and just like every other next gen altcoin developer did.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:39:50
Proof of stake is the solution. Unfortunately people who already own bitcoins have confirmation bias so strong that they cannot accept this obvious truth.
The nothing at stake problem has been solved. No PoS coin has ever been successfully attacked. PoS has NO inflation and can sustain its security indefinitely (whereas bitcoin will not be secure when miners are rewarded only by transaction fees, unless transaction fees are insanely high).
The best POS algo, Delegated proof of stake, also allows for very fast transaction speeds, with transactions being fully confirmed after a maximum of 10 seconds. This means trading can actually be done in real time on the decentralized exchange, and merchants can accept the coins without any security risks.
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:32:49
Bashing POW isn't the same as bashing bitcoin. Bitshares, being a blockchain, is a bitcoin fork, it owes its entire existence to bitcoin. The bitshares developers understand and appreciate the genius of Satoshi more than most people. The lead developer had technical conversations with him on bitcointalk back when he still walked among us. However, loving bitcoin shouldn't stop you or anyone else from realizing that POW as it is today is seriously retarded waste. We're spending 43 million USD per month inflating bitcoins for GAW and the others so they can burn fossil fuels to keep our system "decentralized". All we get in return is something like 4 big ASIC companies and 4 big pools that if compromised would take bitcoin down.

Bitcoin cannot be marketed to Argentina because of its volatility. People there are seeking alternative assets to escape volatility, and that's why bitcoin never went viral even when all its other characteristics are desirable. BitUSD gives them just what they want. Just a little professional marketing and people will begin to realize it is the product they have been desperately waiting for, for decades. You're right that any blockchain can do bitassets (except bitcoin because it cannot be upgraded), but the only thing that matters is who manages to bootstrap bitasset liquidity first. Right now bitshares is in the lead as it is the system that invented them and the only system where they are currently functional. Also nubits aren't bitassets because they aren't fully collateralized and only work through centralized exchanges.
Ethereum functionality on its own without a network means nothing. Counterparty ported it, making ETH worthless, and soon bitshares will do so too. We're currently in the process of hiring new developer delegates and some of them will be for just that (along with copying and improving openbazaar to be hosted on the blockchain and creating a monetized TOR)

Yes, I have the same concerns. I think the solution is that with bitshares it will be relatively easy for you to share your "hot identity" private key across several devices you own (encrypted of course), but that's just a guess.
Right now the mobile wallet is still only being tested so there's plenty of ways ahead before this issue will begin to get tackled.

What you're describing is centralized hedging. That already exists fully in bitcoin with bitreserve and locks (And works really well actually - but unfortunately we all know that they will get raided or at least forced to do KYC at some point.)
If you want to have decentralized hedging and avoid counterparty risk, you need to have decentralized collateral, not centralized issuers with (real or fictional) collateral.

This isn't really anything new, BitID has existed for ages.

@_date: 2014-12-09 16:42:05
Well then the discussion isn't done yet. When you download a client from a trusted source you're already trusting them more than if you just got a blockchain hash from them. There's no reason to do a long range attack against someone who trusts you enough to download a client from you, because you can just out a backdoor in their client and steal their private keys. Every time anyone downloads a bitcoin clients they take this risk.
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:39:33


There is no need for regular checkpointing, simply a need for you to trust the place from where you download the client to give you a recent hash (within one year) of the block chain.
Of course you're already trusting this source with downloading the client itself! There is no need for them to long range attack you because if they are malicious they will simply compromise the client itself and steal your keys.
Even if you for some reason trust them with the key-controlling client software but don't trust them with the block chain hash, you can simply look at, say, 3 different sources and compare to make sure you've been given the right one.
Also you are currently very deeply trusting the big 4 pools not to short bitcoin and 51% attack it, or buy a POS altcoin and attack it. POW is basically secured only by the blind trust that miners will not succumb to the tragedy of the commons, and it is honestly delusional.
@_date: 2014-12-06 22:08:48
Bitcoin is already highly centralized, even if sidechains turns out to be technically feasible they will only make bitcoin further vulnerable by centralizing mining even more. The truth is that mining is dead, and the future lies with proof of stake - the big question is if bitcoin will be able to upgrade its own consensus algorithm. My guess is that it can't.
If it can't upgrade itself then bitcoin won't even be in the battle, but rather be exactly as the article described gopher, a first iteration and precursor to the final system. As the crypto community slowly but steadily moves towards accepting the fact that POS is necessary for scalable security and consensus, it is instead other block chains that will fight the block chain battle.
The Bitshares 1.0 protocol will be finished in the beginning of next year, and 2015 will probably be the year where it begins to actually establish itself in the crypto community (currently most people have no clue what it is and how it works, even though it's the 4th biggest altcoin).
Ethereum has so much mindshare that if it ever actually comes out it will be a serious contender. Finally there is NXT, the oldest next gen blockchain with proof of stake, and with a grown and tech savvy community of investors.
The battle will be between the communities of bitshares, ethereum and NXT to see who can take over bitcoins throne. The winner will likely emerge at the end of 2015 and become the final block chain.
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:06:06
I just thought you should know that this blind belief that bitcoin in its current form is good enough to support 2.0 apps is what will cause the downfall of bitcoin. The bitcoin protocol only supports basic sending and receiving. It cannot be used for anything advanced.

I don't even understand what you're talking about now. As long as the ripple ledger is decentralized, it is safe. That has nothing to do with the distribution of the token. It doesn't even make sense to say a token is centralized.

Multisig cannot be used on an exchange because the exchange needs to be able to automatically match orders. Proof of reserves doesn't prevent mark karpeles from running away with your coins either, it just means you know exactly how much money you are never getting back.
The original ripple creators were kinda scammy, I agree. But that doesn't make their system any worse and you are a fool for letting your emotions decide what you think of code.
Also bitcoin has 4 validators (discus fish and friends), ripple has hundreds. Which one is more centralized?
Your cognitive dissonance is so strong that you think just throwing mud at the facts you dislike will make them disappear, because in your world ripple and other altcoins truly is just evil trickery sent by the devil to test your bitcoin faith.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:34:41
That also works, it's a great service with good usability. But the problem, as I see it, is that the value that is being hedged goes towards supporting the fiat market caps, and is taken out of bitcoin. With bitassets you freeze blockchain tokens to hold as collateral, so your hedging benefits the blockchain. Also bitassets are decentralized so they have all the usual benefits that comes with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-14 13:59:10

@_date: 2014-11-21 21:47:34
In the long term the kind of currency that will be used for actual trade will not be a "pure" token like BTC or XCP, instead it will be a derivative that is pegged to real world assets with less volatility (enforced by prediction markets or oracle price feeds). This is because investors who want to invest in a specific user issued asset, or buy stuff with their money will most likely not be interested in simultaneously speculating on the price of BTC or XCP with their float. 
Currently the only volatility resistant tokens are bitassets (in bitshares) and nubits. With the advent of the scripting language being implemented into counterparty we will be sure to see bitassets on there as well. Once that happens we will see the beginning of a serious migration of the BTC market cap into XCP because these bitassets can only be backed by collateral in XCP (since XCP can have decentralized margin calls), and investors will realize that they are the cryptocurrency token that will actually be used for doing business and trading, and thus will move to buy the currency that backs it, XCP. Decentralized margin trading will also not be possible with BTC but will be possible with XCP in the future.
Unless bitcoin is upgraded to be able to similarly act as decentralized collateral for derivates and margin trading, it will not be long term viable, and all attempts by separate blockchains with separate scarcity that has these more advanced features to "integrate" with bitcoin are simply a predatory attempt at cannibalizing its future market cap.

Funny that it's fine to bring up a ripple alt and use that to "prove" ripple is bad, but when POW altcoins prove again and again how ridiculously easy a POW coin is to destroy if you have the funds and the motive somehow it doesn't mean bitcoin is insecure.
Anyway, it's also pretty funny that you bring it up in the first place as it clearly shows you have absolutely no idea about altcoins. Stellar and ripple are designed to allow instant transactions. No wait for 6 confirmations or anything like that, they're meant to have 3 second 100% confirmations. The fork that happened in stellar was the first fork EVER. Bitcoin has forks pretty much every day, and that's with 10 minute blocks.
The stellar devs simply understand that fanatic ideals are less important than having an excellent product, that's why they chose to temporarily centralize the system until they can make sure instant confirmation will work, rather than making confirmation time longer as a failsafe to prevent forks. If you waited, say, 20 or 30 seconds with stellar you wouldn't be at risk, however users obviously don't want to wait that long. Compare that to bitcoin where you are still at risk even after half an hour. Real finance requires instant transactions so this is one reason bitcoin isn't long term viable.
That being said I don't actually think the social network consensus system ripple uses will be what the final block chain runs on, mainly because it doesn't allow for privacy. DPOS is POS and thus fully decentralized with no waste and is fully anonymous with default stealth transactions, but still allows for 10 second full confirmations. That way we can have the consumer usability while keeping anonymity and the fanatic ideals, which is also reflected in the bitshares core developers who are all very strongly libertarian (which IMO is a bit ridiculous but I guess will help when bitcoiners finally have to take the plunge).

The most important part of this is that it allows bitshares to eventually fully copy the features of ripple, but with the huge advantage that it can use bitUSD as the liquidity token instead of the highly volatile XRP. This will result in lower spreads and means that ripple will not be able to compete with bitshares on cost in the long run.
Ripple is centralized and has an initial distribution that is downright evil. It needs to be crushed, and I'd be so happy if bitshares is the blockchain that accomplishes this and eats its market.

People who wishes to short usd on the blockchain can enter into a smart contract with those who want to hedge against BTS volatility. The shorters collateral is 300% the amount shorted locked in BTS. After 30 days or if they get margin called the blockchain automatically covers their short with the collateral and gives them whatever is leftover, so a bitUSD holder is guaranteed to get its value in BTS after 30 days. Shorters also pay interest since they are borrowing USD to go long BTS.

In bitcoin there are 4 trusted nodes that everyone are forced to rely on, tech savvy or not. In getting a hash to protect against an obscure long range attack you can choose to trust anyone who has been running a full node within the last year. Somehow one is totally acceptable to you and "after it catastrophically fails we will just fix it and people will trust us again". The other is apparently enough to render the entire system "inherently insecure" even though there are millions of issues inherent to all block chains that are more pressing.

If you look at the charts you can see that that price of XRP and BTC are fully inversely linked.
Check out the little bumb that happened on both charts where ripple went down and bitcoin went up. What we're observing is a lot of money flowing from bitcoin into ripple.
I agree that ripple isn't the best system, but it's certainly not worse than bitcoin, it's just different. It has some amazing features including 5 sec confirmation and a decentralized exchange that means no goxxing is possible. People who claim the protocol is centralized are liars (who define anything that doesn't pump the bitcoin price as being "centralized FUD"), and the initial distribution of XRP is less important since it's not meant as a store of wealth.
Bitshares will eventually be even better, since it will have the same features as ripple (and much more) but stays true to the bitcoin vision.

True, with market pegged assets you don't actually own USD (or gold/CNY etc). But it's also not an IOU because it doesn't have counterparty risk and isn't backed by a promise. It's like a cryptographically secure, decentralized version of a derivative, like paper gold futures, with 300% of its value locked transparently on the blockchain as collateral in the bitshares base token BTS. The bitUSD is also fungible and can be sent to others just like regular coins, so it can be useful for trade and other things where you want no volatility.
It isn't risk free though, there is still the systemic risk of the entire blockchain crashing too fast for the collateral to be margin called. But the traditional counterparty risk of IOU's - that the other end will just run away with your money or assets (or get them seized by the government) - doesn't exist. This makes market pegged assets a nice decentralized alternative to centralized services such as bitreserve or coinapult when you want to avoid volatility and goxing at the same time. 
Then as soon as you want your money back into real bitcoin, you just go through a bitcoin gateway such as GATEBTC. Bitshares and bitcoin addresses are directly translateable so the private key you use for bitcoin can also be used for bitshares and vice versa, making the experience very seamless (once bitshares comes out of beta and is ready for users). However if you still want to be able to trade quickly, you can also simply buy bitBTC which is the bitcoin market pegged asset, allowing you to be exposed to bitcoin on the bitshares blockchain.

Gateways allow you to withdraw your bitBTC as bitcoin to the same address through anyone running one. They can be completely seamless because the bitshares network confirms after 10 seconds, so you can have your bitcoin transaction on the network almost instantly.

How exactly do you discard KNCminer? Also why does it matter that you can maybe make some better defensive measures if it still isn't done until AFTER the attack, and thus after the payoff for the attacker and the blow to reputation.
Also here's a new attack vector for you: a government publicly announces that it will pay 40k USD per fork, and 20k USD per empty block for the next year. You just have to present proof that you control the private key of the coinbase tx in the block. In this scenario it would be more profitable for miners to attack bitcoin because the lifetime rewards for mining honest blocks with your rigs would be less. Again, an attack that cannot be defended against and requires long winding rationalization a about how "miners would never do that because yadda yadda they don't like money and thus we can trust them".
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:15:09
All bets (i.e. smart contracts) are collateralized with between 150% - 300% of their value in locked BTS. So the market cap of bitshares always has to be at least that much higher than the combined value of all contracts. In case a contract falls below its margin requirement it is automatically margin called by the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:02:46
Remember that this doesn't count as infrastructure for bitcoin though. Bitpay could begin supporting ripples network as payment any day, and bitcoins greatest competitive advantage would instantly evaporate.
What this really shows is that support and exposure isn't what bitcoin lacks. It lacks a proper product. Everyone who is ever going to use bitcoin in its current state already know about it, so any amount of pumping TO THE MOON and bitpaydollars acceptance by big name companies that shows "support" isn't going to make any difference for bitcoin adoption.

Nope, you're wrong, I'd gladly pump bitshares to you if you want. I'm just not oblivious to the competition.

What kind of scenario do you envision where people don't spend any money for a year? Even if this happened there would still be upgrades to the system and first thing you'd do coming back online is to update your client. Then while doing that you can compare the hash given with a hash of anyone in your family or group of friends who have been accessing the blockchain just once for the past year.
It's time you accept that in your panicky denial you're simply bringing up obscure fringe cases that are completely irrelevant in face of the bigger security issues, such as miner centralization and privacy.

This is what bitcoiners have to tell themselves to avoid actually researching and understanding the weaknesses and shortcomings of the bitcoin protocol, and the huge leaps of innovation that have been done in the second gen block chains.
Luckily even if you are unable to accept this before bitcoin has already gone down, you will still not miss the boat. The economic potential of a fully featured block chain is so insanely massive that even at 5 or 50 billion USD market cap it is still an early investment and you'll become an early adopter.

As far as I know, mining empty blocks is not against the rules of the bitcoin network. Once 50% of all blocks are empty and claiming external block rewards it means that 50% of all mining power is ready to perform a 51% attack on bitcoin that orphans any block with a transaction in it.
Bitcoin could hard fork to attempt to prevent empty blocks, but it can probably be circumvented by just putting bogus transactions into the post-attack blocks.
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:24:34
The block chain will never go away. But nothing inherently keeps bitcoin as the strongest blockchain. I've been a bitcoin fanatic since I discovered it long ago, but last crash to sub-300 made me realize that it could fail. I started looking at alts and realized that the blockchain needs to be a lot more powerful before it will be able to seriously compete with the real world banking system.
We're now seeing ripple gaining serious traction because it has an actual function for people: easily exchanging currency. There are other altcoins who have specific functions like this as well.
My favorite is bitshares, which plans to basically integrate and decentralize every functionality onto it's own blockchain.  The developers have the same libertarian visions that satoshi had, and the whole thing is completely open for anyone to develop. The system allows decentralized funding so anyone the community wants to hire as a developer can work directly for the blockchain.
I think once it has become clear that altcoins and stronger features are needed for blockchains to succeed, then bitcoiners will increasingly begin to move to bitshares. Since it has the same features as ripple (plus a lot more) it will also be able to kill ripple and ensure XRP's terrible distribution doesn't end up becoming the basis for a world reserve currency.

Ripple, Bitshares, NXT, Counterparty?
Of course i already know how you will answer this so i will just save you time and type out your own response for you.
the way you rationalize that bitshares and NXT arent interesting is because they are POS and your bitcoin centric worldview requires POS to be unviable (despite it powering 3 of the top 10 block chains).
also you can rationalize ripple as being unviable by claiming it is "not decentralized" (without elaborating further or providing any evidence of course).
finally you can convince yourself that because counterparty runs on the bitcoin blockchain and because the developers claim it, then XCP isnt a direct competitor to BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:07:15


It is so necessary for your identity that POS isn't viable that you're willing to do anything to convince yourself that is the case, even going on idiotic rants like this.

The point of bitUSD is to be pegged to USD. The argument is that USD itself isn't stable (due to inflation). I'd say that compared to bitcoin, bitUSD is nonvolatile

That's called systemic risk. It's the same kind of risk that bitcoin has (i.e. if there is no demand the price will go to 0).

If you have to hold your money in crypto then put it into a bitshares market pegged asset like bitUSD or bitGOLD. You can hold your money in crypto without the volatility and still not supporting the incumbent system. Don't risk losing everything.
@_date: 2014-12-02 10:20:46
3 months from now, everyone will know about it because the bitshares blockchain can fund its own marketing campaigns.
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:06:36


This is the entire point. The trick to getting stable decentralized currency is to use smart contracts. Bitcoin users trading on the bitshares exchange won't ever hold BTS, only market pegged assets.
It's not possible to run a decentralized exchange on the bitcoin network because it doesn't support smart contracts. In the future who knows? maybe it will be possible to transfer two-way pegged bitcoins onto the bitshares exchange and the bitshares blockchain will function as a kind of sidechain. Until then the gateway system works just as well.


This is true. Lightweight client and gateways need to be ready first before this is actually functional in a seamless manner. BitUSD works right now, though, and given that it's the first nonvolatile crypto ever, it's a shame not more people in the community are discussing it or are trying it out. Liquidity needs to already exist in the exchange before it will ever become useful.
I'm not really interested in people actually running out and buying into bitshares. I'm more interested in the community beginning preparing for what it means that we have a decentralized exchange. It's like p2pool, we need the community to actively support it or it won't work out. Right now bitshares is literally still branded as a "shitcoin/scamcoin".

Looks like I was right last time, and I'm only getting more right every day. That being said I don't own any XRP and don't support it, I prefer bitshares. Ripples dominance shows that the age of altcoins is upon us. Bitcoiners need to start accepting the fact that bitcoin will not necessarily be the reserve currency, and unless you want it to be ripple, which is supposedly centralized, then all bitcoiners should start supporting different 2.0 altcoins.
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:42:07
Sorry, that was an unfair way to word it. I realise that there is no better way to fund development in bitcoin at the moment, but I really want to see a system such as paid delegates in DPOS, that allows coinholders fund and decide what is developed, ensuring that developers work purely on increasing the value of the blockchain, and don't have their incentives skewed.
I don't doubt for a second that you developers aren't in this first and foremost "for the science", but I don't think the same for your investors.
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:49:38
Right, so I guess the people who do not have anyone they can trust with running a full node once per year will have to stick with POW. Everyone else who will never encounter that problem can then go with POS. Even then, we're still talking about a long range attack, an obscure and improbable attack vector that requires massive expenditure for the payoff of fooling a single specific node that hasn't been online for a year.
I agree that pools could be convinced to use GBT after a 51% attack has happened. But by then the damage would already be done and bitcoins reputation would be permanently destroyed. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:12:37


You're crazy. The blockchain is a system of human organization. Mining pools are controlled by humans. Voting with stake for a delegate is no different than voting with hashing power for a pool, except that hashing power doesn't actually give a fuck about bitcoin and dump it instantly, while stakeholders are vested in bitshares. Your greed in wishing to pump bitcoin makes you willing to insult anything you see as a threat, even when there is legitimate innovation that solves a legitimate problem.

IOU gateways already have to fully comply with KYC, and it is much more seamless than bitcoins KYC since it can be transferred from one gateway to another.

Right so backdoor all large pools including those the ASIC manufacturers use for their own mining. KNCminer doesn't even sell its units anymore, so it would be impossible for outsiders to determine if they are controlled. The entire company could already be infiltrated and it is completely impossible for us to determine this. Same with the Chinese operations. The entire security of bitcoin rests on 4 big pools and a huge "maybe" regarding the manufacturers.


Wrong. Ripple currently has its entire 1 million plus volume on its decentralized exchange, proving that when a superior exchange system is available people prefer to use that (which is pretty damn obvious anyway).
Anyone can control large amounts of coins, governments included. But it will always be impossibly expensive for a government to buy or seize 51% of the voting stake. Especially when compared to how trivial it is to buy or seize 51% of mining power (just pay to backdoor KNCminer, ASICminer and whatever other Chinese producers exists). Even in the absurd fringe case where a malicious actor gains control of more than 51% of the actively voting stake and uses it to stop the block chain from working, the honest stake can simply create a fork without the maliciously voting stake.

XRP is just like bitcoin, except with faster transaction speeds. XRP is fully competing with BTC and is currently massively outperforming it on the markets. Ripple ALSO has the capability to support IOU's, which is a huge feature that has meant it has been integrated with banks, AND it has a decentralized exchange to trade those IOU's.
Bitcoin is not really programmable money, it doesn't have a smart contracts or anything like that. If you want that kind of stuff look into bitshares or NXT. Bitcoin is just a bare bones blockchain with an outdated consensus algorithm and no ability to upgrade itself or fund its own development (Of course being the first blockchain bitcoin is still a huge deal, but it is seriously outdated from a tech POV).

Bitshares takes POS one step further with DPOS by allowingt he stakeholders of the blockchain to actively allocate their capital at things that will increase the value of the blockchain, such as marketing and development. As the bitshares increases in value, the amount of money that shareholders can choose to spend on development increases, and development of the blockchain can eventually become a gargantuan business.
All this is completely decentralized with no need for external centralized organizations to fund development(and thus extract profit from it somehow), making things like the bitcoin foundation obsolete.

The whole point is that while miners cannot impose new transaction rules on nodes, they can mine empty blocks at will, and orphan any blocks that include transactions. I guess a defensive measure could be to implement a system into bitcoin that invalidates empty blocks, but it can probably be circumvented. 
Unless it is possible in some way to force miners to include all transactions, then it will always be possible to pay them off to halt transactions on the bitcoin network entirely, and the reverse acquisition attack describes a way this weakness can be used profitably by an altcoin.

True, you could probably say that bitshares is more risky than bitcoin at the moment. Right now bitshares doesn't really have any users at all, every single person involved in it is an investor who bought it because they're betting it will be useful in the future.

One attack will be enough to permanently destroy bitcoins reputation. Mining power tends towards centralization over time as ASIC manufacturers are consolidated to save R&amp;D costs and reduce variance, so the system becomes more vulnerable over time. This is undeniable economic fact. Even if pools became decentralized, which there is zero guarantee will actually happen, attackers will simply go after the massive centralized manufacturers. Bitcoin is insecure and will be taken down the moment a government or big shorter decides to do so.


Typical bitcoin cultish denial. This is the kind of stuff you have to constantly tell yourself about every other system to avoid ever getting to know the features of them, so you can feel happy in pretending that bitcoin isn't inferior. When something makes you feel uncomfortable because it seems better than bitcoin, you simply convince yourself that it "isn't decentralized" and then ignore it, as if simply saying that about something is enough to make it irrelevant.
The Ripple system does not have a central authority, and does not have a single point of failure. Thus it is not centralized. In fact compared to bitcoin which relies on 4 trusted nodes, ripple is impossible to take down because every server is a validator to the clients that trust it.
Even if ripple was centralized it would have nothing to do with users preference of gateways. The simple fact is that when gateways are available people will use them rather than centralized exchanges for ridiculously obvious reasons. Of course you will never admit this and will continue to insist that people prefer centralized exchanges because bitcoin can never have gateway functionality and you are desperately afraid of having to accept bitcoins shortcomings.

@_date: 2014-12-07 12:07:06


It's exactly the same for DPOS and every other block chain. Once you have the block chain on your computer you won't have to trust anyone, but when you first download the client and the block chain, trust is always required. This goes for both POW and POS. 
If mining could be upgraded and centralized pools could be avoided, it would already have been done. There is no rationale for leaving bitcoin in its current extremely vulnerable state. A single major 51% would be enough to permanently destroy bitcoins reputation, even if the network "adapted to the attack" afterwards. Of course in reality this adaptation will be realized by users selling their bitcoins and buying POS coins instead, rather than wait around for "adaption" to spontaneously occur.

It doesn't matter if it's bitUSD or bitGLD or whatever. You're completely right that it's not real USD (or gold), and there's no real USD backing it. It's a CFD that tracks the price of the underlying asset. If bitUSD could run on bitcoin, it wouldn't be worth 1 USD, but it would always be exchangeable for 1 USD's worth of BTC, no matter what happens to the BTC price. As long as the required collateral and margin for the counterparty is high enough to cover any possible volatility that gives you risk-free, decentralized hedging.
Bitshares currently has it implemented and working pretty well. You can see how it acts here:  . Compare it with the huge volatility of BTS itself. It even pays a decent interest rate. 
However, since bitshares has almost no network effect and isn't used for any trade its bitUSD is completely useless for anything other than speculating on the price of BTS (or its interest rate). On the other hand, if bitcoin was able to implement this it would mean all the value transfered to e.g. the bitpay vendors that currently insta-dump as their hedging strategy would actually stay inside the bitcoin ecosystem much longer (since for every bitUSD in existence there is a corresponding amount of locked collateral). Telling these shops to "forget about USD" isn't going to help at all. It's just going to make them switch to BTS that doesn't require them to either dump or worry about volatility. Instead we should take these features and implement them into bitcoin.

POS fail safe: Create a fork without the malicious stake.
However this defense won't work in practice for POW or POS, since it requires a trusted central authority to create the hardfork, or you'd see 10's or 100's of fail safe forks all competing to be the "real" one. In such a situation almost all traders who have any risk aversion would simply sell everything they had on every fork because they wouldn't be able to determine which one would end up as the winner, and thus holding or buying anything would be too risky for almost everyone.
The only real defense is to prevent anyone from amassing 51% control, and POS is superior in this regard.
Our best option to ensure bitcoins future viability, protect against miner centralization and getting the mining debasement under control is to upgrade it to have DPOS in addition to POW, giving it the advantages if both systems. @_date: 2014-12-30 17:31:36


The regulation will apply, yes, but it will not be enforceable.


Bitcoin is definitely widely accepted though. You can easily store all your money in digital currency and just shop with gyft and bitpay. Bitcoin will probably always stay the most widely accepted cryptocurrency, because any business that begins to accept an altcoin will also accept bitcoin as well, just because it's so easy to implement. Even if bitcoin one day doesn't have the largest market cap anymore, it will still be accepted as money every place that uses blockchain tech.

Bitcoin is currently inflationary. The advertised deflationary nature is 100% based on trust, through a hope that miners will not choose to hard fork at next block reward halving even if makes economic sense for them to do so (they will argue that the reward needs to stay high to "secure" the network, and people who already think POW is a safe system will believe it).

Just because XCP runs on the bitcoin blockchain doesnt mean it isnt directly competing with BTC. The ethereum smart contracts that have been implemented will only be able to use XCP, and over time most people will want to hold their crypto in those kind of smart contracts because they offer a whole range of options such as better security than multisig and protection against volatility. If XCP becomes the dominant next gen platform then over time it will siphon off the entire bitcoin market cap. Especially since bitcoin holders have to pay for mining through inflation but XCP holders pay only tx fees.
Also sidechains are already done, but they will result in further mining centralization and will render the bitcoin network completely defenseless against a 51% attack because switching mining algo will be pretty much impossible with several sidechains. Blockstream is probably working on using some form of complicated zero-knowledge proofs to fix the most glaring sidechain vulnerability which was miners stealing the sidechain coins. Even when the tech is "ready" there are so many inherent problems with it that its not sure the updates will be pushed through.
one year is a long time in the crypto space anyway. Competing systems will be marketing their finished products to consumers who will likely prefer them since bitcoin has such a negative image as a cult to ordinary people.

That post makes no sense. Of course you factor the inflation of USD when determining whether to use it or not in conjunction with a credit card service. That's why you'd use USD and not Zimbabwean dollars. This is nothing more than a dishonest attempt at misleading people to think mining doesn't cost them. Kinda disgusting when you consider that bitcoiners attempt to use inflation as an argument for why fiat is bad in the first place.

Counterparty is competing directly with bitcoin though. I think it could best be described as a wolf in disguise. If BTC allows counterparty to piggyback off its network effet, in the long run the entire BTC market cap will go into counterparty, bitcoin will collapse, and bitcoin miners will simply be paid externally in XCP for mining their blocks. It's not really any different from ripple. All news that is bullish for counterparty is long term bearish for bitcoin. 
Sidechains are a bad solution, but at least they honor the broad distribution and maintains the scarcity of bitcoin.
Personally I think the best solution is to prematurely inflate the supply of bitcoins to pay miners off to upgrade bitcoin with the technically best blockchain 2.0 protocol (and prevent excessive long term mining inflation). I've even made a subreddit about it: (currently nothing there except me rambling)

Ripple has hundreds of independent validators. That is not centralized.
Gateways ARE liable for the IOUs being transmitted, but it is made seamless because people simply uses XRP as the means of exchange between different IOUs. It is no different than bitcoin being 100% reliant on centralized exchanges, in fact it is more secure since ripple gateways don't even hold XRP and thus cannot pull a gox like bitcoin exchanges, who hold your BTC, can. It is being used by real banks right now, is fully compliant with the law and is much more useful than bitcoin. It's also the only major crypto whose price is actually up in 2014.
That being said my bet is still on bitshares since it has even more advanced features than ripple, while maintaining the gateway system and the fast transaction speeds.

I might have misunderstood your post, but bitUSD is live right now: 
So is bitCNY, bitGOLD, bitEUR etc.
The wallet just needs to be better and there needs to be a proper bitcoin gateway system. Once that's implemented it will be a perfect high speed decentralized exchange where you can easily trade and hedge your bitcoin (using the market pegged assets), and then whenever you want to convert to real bitcoin you just send it out through an anonymous gateway

Bitcoiners erroneously think that if they simply pretend better block chains don't exist, then those block chains will never gain traction and outcompete bitcoin. Thus they think that by denying any innovation is happening they are protecting their own investment.
The truth is of course that the best block chain will win in the long run no matter what. Bitcoin has some fundamental problems that means it cannot grow any further, such as wasteful mining and the inability to upgrade itself, so it isn't even in the competition to see which system will become the final blockchain.

And those who are already into block chain tech, no matter the flavor, will be sure to be among those.

With bitUSD the blockchain acts as this third party, the decentralized protocol ensures you can always get one USD worth of BTS. It is a smart contract for difference with frozen collateral on the blockchain, rather than an IOU. You should check it out, its very interesting.

They should consider holding it in bitUSD. Support the crypto community and avoid volatility at the same time!
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:16:16
Check out bitassets, I truly didn't believe it would be possible at first either.
It's like a decentralized CFD contract enforced by 101 delegates through price feeds. Then it has 300% in blockchain collateral so every 1 USD of bitasset freezes 3 USD worth of blockchain tokens, decreasing supply and increasing price.
@_date: 2014-12-13 20:45:27
Bitshares solves this with BitUSD and bitGOLD that are fully pegged to USD/gold and work completely without counterparty risk, since they are CFD smart contracts collateralized by 300% of their value locked in BTS (the base token of the bitshares blockchain).
There is still systemic risk associated with a black swan crash of the collateral that happens too fast for margin calls to execute (this would require a 66% price fall within minutes), but the traditional centralized counterparty risk that is typically associated with other pegging systems, such as bitreserve, does not exist. In essence they function completely as bitcoin without the volatility.

With bitcoin, whenever you want to get in or out of the system, you have to go through a centralized entity that needs to get all your personal details. This is required every single time you need to buy or sell. As a result, a lot of bitcoin are held at exchanges. At any second the state decides bitcoin is a threat, these coins will be seized, and all bitcoin trading will stop.
If you use bitshares for trading, you only need to get in once. The moment you want to no longer be exposed to bitcoins volatility, you can simply get bitUSD. This means that local exchange gets easier, and it also means that merchants won't have to dump for fiat. It finally allows us to begin building a free market without survelliance.
I just read through all your posts and I can't find any specific questions beyond this.

@_date: 2014-11-29 10:17:00
The reason why there isn't counterparty risk is because the peg is enforced by smart contracts. No 3rd party or promise. The only risk is the systemic risk of the entire coin crashing too fast to margin call. To compensate for that risk bitassets pay interest

Lol, so now we have to trust the legal system? Why not just use fiat then, it has the exact same protections. Anyway, obviously what intelligence agencies will do is that they subpoena the ASIC manufacturers with a gag order and forces them to install backdoors in all their mining units, exactly like is currently being done with routers and phones. In fact it would surprise me if this isn't already happening in china, where government backdoors are a requirement when producing any tech.


Next gen block chains do not rely on centralized exchanges holding their coins for obvious reasons. They use the system of gateways+decentralized exchange that ripple pioneered to ensure that exchangers only hold fiat, and that coin holders always hold their own private keys, even when trading.
Currently bitshares still has most of its volume on centralized exchanges but this is because bter and btc38 started trading it before the gateway system was ready. Once version 1.0 of the protocol is ready they will switch to becoming gateways as well, along with other interested exchanges around the world (even coinbase has requested more information from the lead devs about becoming a gateway).

Realistically, bitcoin has already reached its peak. The world has already been exposed to bitcoin now, and everyone who will ever get utility from using bitcoin are currently using it. A financial crisis could change these circumstances, but since bitcoin is still basically considered gambling by real investors it probably wont be upgraded to safe haven status before such a time.
Real growth in the crypto world is happening in ripple now, as it is actually useful for things such as forex trading and remittance right now, so there is still an influx of new users and even real banks integrating it. Soon we might see other altcoins also carving out a niche and seeing real growth in markets that they are able to serve better than existing systems.

BitGOLD does not have counterparty risk because it is collateralized by funds locked on the blockchain. There is still systemic risk from black swan crashes happening too fast to execute, but there is no trusted counterparty and it functions entirely like bitcoin pegged to gold. Once more people start to realize what immense potential bitcoin without volality and decentralized hedging in general is, the next phase of crypto commerce can begin. Imagine if merchants accepting bitcoin didn't have to instadump in order to hedge against the volatility. Suddenly the crypto ecosystem would have a chance to form closed loops.

POW is unsustainable. Mining is a natural monopoly. The network will not be safe when block subsidy is 0 unless transaction fees are insanely high and completely prohibitive.
Additionally bitcoin cannot be upgraded. Miners are not vested in bitcoin, and cannot efficiently form consensus on doing upgrading hardforks.
The solution is POS (or even better, DPOS, which also solves a bunch of other problems such as slow transactions). But because everyone here have a vested interest in pumping bitcoin every single time this is brought up it turns into a shitshow of scam accusations and outright lies about how "POS cannot form decentralized consensus" - a baseless claim which is actually based on a naive paper describing the nothing at stake problem which was solved long ago with block production bonds/delegate reputation, and recently refuted in a blog post by vitalik.

Nice try at derailing the conversation with semantics. But this is getting boring so lets change the subject: bitcoin miners currently instantly dump their block rewards and fees. In a future where the bitcoin blockchain is used as a global ledger of hashes, its likely miners will prefer to get paid directly in fiat for including transactions in the blockchain.
The long term success of bitcoin as a ledger is therefore independent of the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:11:47
Why do you think bitcoin undermines fiat currency? All normal people look at bitcoin and see how volatile and inaccessible it is to them, even 6 years in. Then they look at the stability of fiat and conclude that its a system that actually works pretty well, despite its flaws.
I dont disagree that blockchain technology will play an important role in the future, and bitcoin might even see limited success as virtual gold. But for everyone except the most rabid libertarian cultists, bitcoin isnt a contender with the financial system and it certainly isnt a safe store of value, especially in the case of a crisis.
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:45:12
Maybe bitcoin should be allowed to grow organically instead of getting proselytised/shoved in peoples faces? I swear all the "marketing" that the community has tried to do has only hurt bitcoins price and, and forever branded the community as a cult.
People need to understand that they can actually turn people OFF from bitcoin. Your misguided attempts at converting new members might not just result in them not getting converted, but also give them such a terrible first impression that they will forever have a negative image of bitcoin in their mind and will impart these beliefs onto other people.
Best example is insisting on using bitcoin for payments in shops. If someone sees a bitcoin transaction fail (which happens pretty often since it's so complicated) they will forever see bitcoin as a terrible payment system. If you only used bitcoin when it's actually convenient for you, not just to shove it in as many peoples faces as possible, then you would primarily be giving off positive impressions of it, and allow it to grow the way tech normally does - by providing value to its users.

Ripple actually offers something useful to ordinary people, a way to transfer and exchange money instantly. People don't care about arbitrary labels that crypto fanatics like to slap on things, they care about whether it is useful to them.
It is however totally false that ripple is centralized, and you're being incredibly dishonest by claiming it is so since you're clearly doing it with the intent to pump your own investment. Bitcoin has 4 trusted nodes (discus fish and friends) that control the entire network. Compare that to ripple which has hundreds of validators, all of whom are independent of ripple labs. Ripple is premined yes, but the premine is clearly being spent responsibly to improve the system, and the price is steadily climbing as a result.

First of all it's important to realize that bitGOLD isn't backed by gold. It's not an IOU. Rather it is a type of derivative known as a CFD (contract for difference) and it is backed by BTS, in the same way that paper gold futures are backed by USD rather than physical gold.
The way bitGOLD is created is that two parties enter into a smart contract with one person going short gold (going long BTS), and another going long gold.
The shorter gets the ability to gain leveraged exposure to BTS, and has to post 200% collateral in BTS, in addition to the 100% paid by the person going long gold, for a total of 300% of the value of bitGOLD held as locked colleteral in BTS. It is this locked collateral that backs bitGOLD tokens.
The person going long gold gains a fungible token, bitgold, that can always be exchanged to an amount very near to the value of gold in BTS. This is because the bitGOLD shorters are forced to cover, or reup collateral within 30 days. In practice this means that they have a token that behaves just like bitcoin, but has its price locked to gold.
There are many different bitassets in addition to bitGOLD, such as bitUSD (the biggest bitasset). You can see how the peg holds here:  (there are sometimes glitches in how the price is shown on CMC, but it usually swings in value within 0.99 - 1.01 USD)
the bitCNY peg holds even better, with Btc38.com recently starting to accept bitCNY as if it was CNY, i.e. if you send them 8000 bitCNY they will credit you with 8000 CNY. So for bitCNY the peg is exactly 1:1.
The huge advantage this could mean for crypto in the future is that it means businesses won't have to instantly dump their bitcoins for fiat in order to hedge. If they are paid in bitassets they can stay in crypto until they actually need to buy something else with it, and can cash out at that time. The only risk with bitUSD, bitGOLD or bitCNY is the systemic risk of a black swan event doing a margin squeeze. In order to compensate for this systemic risk, and to pay for the ability of shorters to leverage their BTS exposure, all bitassets pay yield, an interest that is calculated and paid out every time you move your bitasset balance. Currently the bitUSD yield is around 2% per year, which is way better than the negative rates some banks charge.
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:24:37

I'm sorry but there are literally no arguments left against PoS. Nothing at stake was the only legitimate concern, and it has been solved. Linking to a religious rant isn't really going to change anyones mind. Those who are already lost in confirmation bias do not need any arguments for why PoW is the best, it is already a foregone conclusion. Those who are able to objectively look at what mining and PoW means in the long term will not be persuaded by someone throwing around fancy religious words.
At this point it's all cognitive dissonance trying to ignore the fact that bitcoin is doomed to stay proof of work forever, and thus will die either from mining inflation and dumping, or from total lack of security when mining inflation stops (or, most likely, perpetual mining inflation as the big 4 pools decide not to implement the next reward halving).
The truth is that it doesn't matter if it's bitcoin or any other blockchain that comes out on top and ends up as the final blockchain that implements all financial features. What bitcoin currently does is just the extremely tiny tip of the iceberg of what blockchains can do, and second gen altcoins are now implementing all the other functionalities. Bitcoiners should be excited about these new developments, just like they were excited about bitcoin when it first came out. But they ignore them and tell themselves that it's all useless. In most cases it's completely impossible to break down the cognitive dissonance, no matter what feature you present to them, it will all be dismissed as "shitcoin" "scam" "useless" bla bla bla. Even now as ripple is exploding in popularity bitcoiners are insisting that it is utterly useless (while in the same breath admitting they have no fucking clue how it works).
The important thing is that blockchain tech ends up changing the world. The bitcoin community used to be about innovation, but at this point it has literally devolved into being about pumping a speculative investment that has already peaked in usefulness.

It will go up a lot more next month when mobile/light client is ready and the marketing push begins, investors will expect the BTS price to increase so they will be willing to pay high interest rates to short bitUSD.

Same reason people currently trust gold stored on their behalf by someone else. If they trust the gold is there and they trust the value of gold, then theyll be happy with a cryptographic gold IOU.
Trusting that the blockchain works as a ledger doesn't mean trusting the monetary value of bitcoin. The two things are independent because bitcoin isn't necessary for a functional blockchain - e.g. you can use any currency to pay the SHA256 miners of the blockchain to include a transaction and it will work just as fine.

The problem with the hardfork is that there's always going to be some group of people who refuse to recognize it and who continues mining and trading on the original bitcoin blockchain, meaning that the blockchain will continue to exist. That creates the unfortunate scenario where there will be 2 bitcoin blockchains e.g. on coinmarketcap, trading at different values.
The newly created 20 mb blockchain will probably be the biggest and most valueable at first, but I think it's likely that things like blockchain accounting and proof of existence hashes will be put into the original bitcoin blockchain because that's the only blockchain that you can be 100% sure will always exist, and the fees and blocksize limit isn't a problem when using it for public accounting purposes.

I've been 100% bitcoin myself in the past. And seriously, even from a bitcoin super bullish perspective you really ought to diversify. You could even still do 33% bitcoin and you'd still have really strong exposure to the upside, but be a lot safer if there is a crash.

The post wasn't even really about bitshares. It was more about general exasperation with the "shitcoin shield" that is so prevalent in all of bitcoin.
Imagine if paycoin started to trade on the bitshares exchange. They'd be able to take full benefit of a decentralized exchange because they aren't at war with every other blockchain, and their community is able to see the benefit in working together with other communities. A coin with a decentralized exchange will always win against one that relies on centralized infrastructure. (Why do you want fiat USD btw, wasn't bitcoin about escaping that in the first place?)
Bitcoin is still at risk of being regulated out of existence, and this is one of the opportunities there is to finally remove that risk. Instead someone like me who attempts to expose people to this opportunity gets shit on, branded a shill and a liar whenever I post, despite having been a member of the bitcoin community since the very early days.

Actually banks have decades of experience managing network security, as well as centuries of experience collaborating in payments networks.
The reason why it hasnt been done "already" is because its being built right now and hasnt been finished. It will probably take 5-10 years before such a system is ready to handle the money of ordinary people at the level of security real world banking requires.

There is nothing inherently wrong with having decentralized checkpoints. The only situation there would ever be e.g. A 2000 block long reorganization, would be as an attack. If someone suddenly came with 2000 empty bitcoin blocks out of nowhere that invalidated all recent transactions on the network, would you accept it or simply implement a system to prevent large reorgs?
You can check out DPOS, it is a POS system that doesn't rely on checkpoints, but rather relies on Transactions as Proof of Stake to prevent reorgs.

eDollar tries to solve this by using diversified collateral. At launch we'll probably have 5 different kinds: bitcoin, ether, makercoin, augur reputation and physical gold through digixglobal.
Maker acts as the "insurer of last resort" by spending its own reserves if any collateralized debt position becomes undercollateralized. In the worst case scenario where a massive event drains all of the reserves, the makercoin themselves inflate and are used to prop up the price, sovereignty shares style.

But coinfeinne cannot be automated either, its transaction are way too slow for that. Even if you use the same payment processor, you still have to wait for several bitcoin confirmations to be safe. It's an excellent  decentralized on-ramp system though, and I agree that localbitcoins isn't safe in the long run. You won't see liquidity move from localbitcoins to coinfeinne until the centralization actually harms it though. Bitsquare.io seems to be another system that works like this and I think this method of getting into crypto by average people will become more and more popular.

Shapeshift just started accepting bitUSD! This means its super easy for anyone to hedge their bitcoins at any time and easily get back into bitcoin.

Is there a decentralized exchange for nubits?
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:11:07
The 101 delegates (PoS mining pools) all publish a weighted exchange rate taken from the various BTS exchanges. The median exchange rate for each bitasset becomes the price feed. Stakeholders constantly monitor delegates to ensure their price feeds are correct and if someone isn't publishing their feeds, or even worse is publishing wrong data, they will lose their stakevotes and someone else will take their delegate spot.
Because the price feed is based on the median you'd have to compromise 51 delegates in order to compromise the price feed i.e. perform a 51% attack which is almost impossible with proof of stake coins.

I think the white paper explains it best: 
The TL;DR version is that the smart contract backing it holds 300% of the value in locked collateral.
When/if two-way pegging to PoS chains becomes reality then bitshares will likely become a bitcoin sidechain and bitBTC wont even be needed, you can just trade bitUSD against real bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:52:05
The bitshares decentralized exchange has bitcoin/usd trading working now (using bitbtc/bitusd as proxy). Soon leveraged trading will be supported as well. Therell be no need to ever use a centralized exchange except as an on-ramp, and even that can be done by coinffeine or bitsquare
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:30:39
Bitshares has it working with market pegged assets. You can trade bitBTC against bitUSD at 10 second block times with no counterparty risk.
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:57:53
You could call bitUSD a fiat derivative, but it's not actually backed by fiat. Instead it's backed by the bitshares token directly with a high amount of collateral locked on the blockchain in a transparent and verifiable manner. You can check out the status of the different BitAssets and their collateral here: 
Since it's a cryptocurrency token there is no regulation or KYC etc. Shapeshift doesn't appear to be located in the US and if necessary would be able to operate over TOR to completely evade any regulatory crackdown.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:25:14
The problem isn't the onramp itself. There's very little risk when buying directly and withdrawing instantly from the exchange, or doing p2p local trade. The problem is that peope leave their money (private keys) on the exchange because they want to continously trade. That's when the exchange gets hacked and everyone gets burned. Once you're in the bitshares system, you can trade freely and won't have to rely on any counterparty.

That is quite interesting actually. Who will decide what the rules for these required transactions are? Can't the miners just circumvent it by minimizing the amount of transactions they include to exactly follow the rules, but still rendering the network essentially useless?
I can see that if a system can be implemented that has nodes reject blocks that don't contain almost all broadcasted transactions, then the attack can be defended against. This could create some serious DOS vulnerabilities though.
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:43:41
Over time as all BTS exchange moves to the internal decentralized exchange this won't be needed anymore. The market will just need a price feed of the bitUSD:USD ratio (so if the peg ever deviates from 1:1 the blockchain can issue more or less bitUSD to compensate).
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:56:51
Where do you get the idea that it's concentrated in a few hands? The largest group of holders have around 5%. That's less than satoshi holds of bitcoin.
And the idea that mining = fair distribution is laughable, but 50% of bitshares was actually distributed to the holders of a non-premined POW coin (protoshares).
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:16:21
Most trading isn't done to get in or out of bitcoin. It's done to speculate on the price. Most of us would prefer to stay in crypto 100% of the time and only get out when buying something with bitcoin, because that's the only way you can avoid surveillance and avoid having your funds seized.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:13:25
Combining the nonvolatile and interest bearing bitUSD with the frictionless experience and wide adoption of bitcoin is absolutely amazing. It means people can use and spend bitcoin without worrying about volatility because of altcoins like bitUSD (increasing adoption of both bitUSD and bitcoin), and it also means that altcoins like bitUSD can promote merchants to accept bitcoin, a well established and trusted brand, rather than try to push their own altcoin (with unecessary competition and complications between the different coins).
The frictionless nature of cryptocurrency means they all can complement each other so perfectly well. I used to be a bitcoin maximalist. Then I became a bitshares maximalist. Now I realize that there is room for many cryptocurrencies because they can all provide their own unique benefits while running on the rails of bitcoin and the massive infrastructure it has carved out over the past 6 years.

This is what this article is all about.
The other concerns it mentions are real, but they are no big deal if the above quote isn't also true. And it isn't, it's a straight lie.
The bitshares developers, I3, own about 100-150 million BTS in total, out of a 2.5 billion total. That's proportionally far less than what satoshi owns of bitcoin, or the early NXT investors own of NXT.
The fact is that bitshares has the fairest distribution yet seen in the crypto world, based 50% on POW, 50% on a big ICO. That's the only reason why DPOS works so well, and the founders knew this (which is why they made sure the distribution was fair).
I know will love this article, even when it is based entirely on a direct lie. I know I'll get massively downvoted by cultists for going against the hivemind. But know that the only thing that really matters in the end is performance, and people who actually use and get exposed to the bitshares products (such as the nonvolatile bitUSD) cannot be scared away no matter how much FUD you try to spread.

I don't think it is possible to upgrade a POW coin to POS. The only scenario I can imagine is if mining became so centralized that a single group could essentially decide to end mining and let POS take over, but they would then be giving up all their mining investments.

Only at the moment of transfer. There's a significant difference between only being exposed to counterparty risk when you actually move your money rather than having all your money fully under the control of a 3rd party at all times.
Shapeshift would only be able to steal a couple minutes worth of volume and would lose all their future business income as a result. Lets say their fees are 0.1% and they are able to steal 10 minutes of volume. It would only make economic sense for them to do so if they don't expect their business to last more than a week into the future. Because the incentives are so heavily in favor of them remaining honest, you can trust them even if they stay anonymous allowing them to stay out of reach of regulatory crackdown and funds seizure (the real counterparty risk).
Counterparties like snapswap, tether, nubits, etc. can run away with the entire pool of customer funds, an amount of money that greatly exceeds their expected income over decades. As rational actors the only thing that keeps them from stealing your money at any moment in time is the legal risk of doing so, not their business model. If at any point in time the legal cost of stealing your money becomes lower than the amount of money they can steal from you, your money will be gone.

What is the cause of this crazy delusion? I see so many people repeat this exact thing even though it obviously makes no sense. Bitcoin can easily have long term value in the same way as other goods with zero or no intrinsic value has it, like art or old coins or gold.
Bitcoin can also not go to infinity or go mainstream due to its volatility, which will never disappear or reach levels anywhere close to fiat currencies. The only reason why anyone believes the "to the moom" rhetoric is because a large portion of the bitcoin community is essentially a doomsday cult which combines conspiracy theory with the deification of satoshi to honestly believe the world is collapsing any day now, and that they will be rewarded after the apocalypse (which is uncannily similar to the belief of most other cults)

This is an argument against using PoW. Taking down bitcoin only requires a couple hundred million dollars, whereas taking down a PoS secured blockchain through a 51% attack is usually impossible since there aren't enough tokens on the open market.
NaS is not an attack vector, it is more of a tragedy-of-the-commons kind of weakness that uncaring PoS validators could succumb to, in the same way that bitcoin miners don't care about the network becoming centralized. If there's any sort of economic incentive to prevent them from supporting forks the uncaring but neutral validators (i.e. not actively seeking to attack the network at a loss) will never support forks.


Defeats what point? Blockchains are real economic entities, not computer science experiments. The point is to make the safest system possible to store your money in for an average user. Also checkpoints do not come from a central authority, they come from your social network and web of trust, which is where you get your software and your wallet clients from.


These mechanisms that is used to determine that a software update doesn't contain a trojan can also be used to determine that it doesn't contain a malicious checkpoint.

If you only cared about digital currency for the benefits it brings, you wouldn't attack altcoins. They are the only place where innovation is actually happening, and they are the chance of bringing crypto forward and escaping the bear market (through things such as no more mining).
Bitcoin is exactly the same as it was 6 years ago. It cannot be upgraded, the mining inflation cannot be managed. Satoshi's invention is amazing, a complete paradigm shift. But that doesn't mean it's the final solution, especially considering that it was invented before anyone knew how cryptocurrency would work in practice. To think that bitcoin would be both the first AND the final blockchain is stretching it - it's always been obvious for most people that it wouldn't be bitcoin, but *something like bitcoin* that ends up becoming the new world reserve currency. It shouldn't matter to us - everyone who's currently into crypto will end up benefitting from it if any cryptocurrency breaks out, because we're the people on ground zero who understands why it's so powerful.

Paypal has been using IOU's to operate more conveniently in fiat for more than 10 years. You don't need a blockchain for that, a central ledger is more efficient since it is all based on centralized counterparty trust anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:51:07
Bitshares will deliver many of these features in the coming months. With bitcoin bridges you can hold your money as market pegged bitUSD or bitGOLD, and send it as bitcoin. The blockchain also has name registration that can be used both by bitcoin and bitshares (bitcoin and bitshares share private keys). To make it easy to confirm you are sending money to the correct registered name there is an inbuilt robohash in the clients - if you make a single typo the robot will look completely different and you'll be able to instantly notice.
Once there are combined bitcoin/bitshares lightweight wallet all of these issues can be solved once and for all. The only weak point are the bridges, they have counterparty risk and require temporary trust at the moment of trade (can be mitigated by cutting up large transactions into several smaller ones). The software is open source and anyone can run one so there will be plenty of competition and scrutiny to ensure only the most trustworthy.
The real long term goal should be a two-way peg though. That way you can transfer and trade your bitcoin in a completely trust-free manner.

Even you must be able to admit that compared to nubits, BitUSD at least isn't an outright ponzi. The tokens are at best backed by BTC, but after BTC has been falling these anonymous "trusted" custodians will have lost a lot of their holdings and are basically operating as a fractional reserve. It's literally two anonymous guys running the whole show, yet people are falling for it and throwing millions at it...

Here's a paper explaining how market pegged assets work:
the supply is not controlled by an algorithm, it's controlled by free market participants engaging in smart contracts, and that's why it long term sustainable.  There are risks of the collateral crashing too fast, but those risks are known by the market and at current volatility levels the collateral requirements are set very high in order to minimize the risk.

The bitshares blockchain guarantees to pay you 1 USD worth of BTS according to the exchange rate. The BTS that will be paid out is held in locked collateral on the blockchain so it can always be verified. So while you can't be sure to find someone who will pay you 1 USD for your bitUSD, you can be sure to get an amount of BTS that can be exchanged to 1 USD on a centralized exchange. As adoption grows you'll also see more people accepting bitassets directly. BTC38 currently accepts bitCNY sent to their exchange as real CNY at a 1:1 rate.

By this definition anyone who doesn't write their own bitcoin client from scratch are trusting a centralized authority to approve their ledger (it is the client that approves the ledger, and by downloading it from someone else you're getting it from a "centralized authority").
If someone is able to insert a malicious checkpoint into a client, they could just as easily have inserted a trojan, a keylogger, or hardcode all transactions to go to their own bitcoin address, all attacks that are much simpler, cheaper and more profitable than attempting to do a long range attack.

You know better than this... I refuse to believe there are people who still think NaS is an issue, it's so trivial to solve.
Block producer bonds to punish producing blocks on multiple chains solves short range NaS + checkpoints in client downloads solves long range NaS (checkpoints in client downloads do not increase risk or require more trust because you already trust the software 100% since you are giving it control of your private keys)

The level of aggressive cultism from maximalists is reaching absurd levels. You're hurting bitcoin and everything else by trying to turn everything into a "pump". Ultimately you're pissed off because you identify this as something that could hurt the price of bitcoin and then you send in the sockpuppets to downvote. It's dumb as hell because price hedging is something that bitcoin needs if it ever wants mainstream adoption.

That's the big problem, bitshares integration is still low. Ideally you trade it against gatewayIOU's issued on the bitshares blockchain, such as bitstampUSD. If you deposit USD with bitstamp, then you get bitstampUSD, if you send bitstampUSD to bitstamp, then they send you a fiat USD transfer.
No such gateways exist yet since the protocol still hasn't reached 1.0. Right now you have to do your trading on the bitshares blockchain, then exchange your bitUSD to BTS, then exchange your BTS to BTC on btc38, poloniex (or another altcoin exchange), then exchange your BTC to USD. This is obviously not useable for most people and is meant to be temporary until the decentralized exchange gateways have been bootstrapped. However if you're already in BTC, and want to trade but don't want to keep your money at a centralized exchange, then keeping it in bitUSD or bitBTC is still doable.
We hope that once 1.0 comes out and there is more awareness about the decentralized exchange, then there will be enough demand to get at least one big exchange to become a gateway or sell bitUSD directly for USD... It's all a question of how much the community wants it and asks for it though.

Maybe risk aversion and the decision to tread slowly and carefully?


They are not using the blockchain the way you think they are (i.e. for settlement or as a place where real value is stored). It's being used as a form of public accounting, something the bitcoin blockchain is excellent for since it's so widespread.
Also, here's a fun fact, using the bitcoin blockchain for accounting or even settlement does not increase the intrinsic value of bitcoin, since miners can be paid in any currency (and do indeed already dump their bitcoin block rewards and fees instantly because they prefer other currencies).
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:41:39
You can hold USD on bitshares in the form of bitUSD. Then when you want to buy bitcoin you exchange it to BTS and then exchange that to BTC on a centralized exchange like poloniex, or you wait until the bitcoin gateways are operational (coming early February) and then you can exchange your bitUSD or bitBTC (BTC held on the bitshares blockchain) directly to real BTC that is sent to your address instantly.

Do you have a solution for how merchants can hedge against bitcoin volatility? I think most stores use coinbase/bitpay so they can dump their bitcoins instantly. You could consider letting merchants choose a bitusd gateway to send their bitcoins to so they can easily store them as bitusd and retrieve them as real bitcoins when they want to cash out or pay bitcoin accepting suppliers. Enables you to hedge against volatility without KYC/AML and have it super easy to get back into bitcoin.

It's getting there. There's currently x-chain.info which functions as a gateway and meta-exchange.com will have a gateway set up soon as well. It will allow you transfer bitcoin on and off the bitshares blockchain similarly to how sidechains were meant to work.
Then you can trade bitcoins against BitUSD on the decentralized exchange and thus trade bitcoins without risking getting goxed.

If interest rates increase it just means there will be even more uncovered nubits. As nubits cannot actually be used for anything the people who buy them expect to be able to get 1 USD worth of value back out of them. However every time the custodians fuck up and have bitcoins dumped on them, every time ppc is given in dividends to nushareholders and every time interest is paid to nubit holders, the amount of collateral per nubit decreases. Its a fractional reserve scheme waiting to blow up.

I think it does because bitshares are incentivized to promote bitcoin in order to increase adoption of their own coins. It's much easier for a merchant to begin accepting bitcoin since the infrastructure is already there with bitpay etc., rather than accept bitUSD directly. Same with onramps, the easiest way to get into bitUSD and bitshares is through bitcoin. 
With low enough spreads and a solution to the zeroconf problem (such as noriskwallet) it will always be easier for all commerce and onramp/offramping to just go through bitcoin, making it the universal cryptocurrency that benefits from innovations in all of the altcoins that depend on it.

They should put their money into market pegged assets like bitBTC or bitUSD then. Use the bitshares decentralized exchange to trade the pairs, and then sell for BTC when you want to go back into real BTC through a gateway or shapeshift (integration coming soon).

Liquidity is still very low and only the full node is ready for use, but it's easy to register and works well enough to be worth using by people who are afraid of counterparty risk.

Bitshares is a decentralized exchange that by default uses stealth addresses for everyone, in a system called TITAN (transfer invisibly to any name).
If you want to trade your bitcoins without giving up your privacy or private keys you can use this to do your trading, getting in and out quickly with BTC gateways and holding your in bitBTC or bitUSD on the bitshares blockchain when you are actively trading.
The first bitcoin gateway, GATEBTC is still under testing. Soon an open source tool, gatewayd, will be released for anyone to use to set up their own bitcoin gateway. Each of these gateways can also function as bitcoin/bitUSD tumblers. This could dramatically increase privacy for both communities.

The only thing that really matters is that the EVM works flawlessly, meaning that the ethereum blockchain is finished at the protocol level and will never need another hard fork, unless a majority of ether holders decide to upgrade to PoS. Compare that to bitcoin which still needs hard forks or risk becoming horribly broken and as such isn't even finished as a protocol. 
Geth (the official client) isn't great, but its good enough for dapps to build their stand-alone clients on top of (such as what augur is doing), so once the thawing phase is up and miners begin to increase the gas limit/blocksize the blockchain will have launched and be fully operational and as mentioned be complete at the protocol level.
That being said it's no secret the crowdsale funds have been utterly wasted. Dumbest part was hodling them all in bitcoin, a decision that ended up costing something like 10 million USD out of the 18 million USD raised as BTC went from 600 to 200. But overall the current state of the EVM was definitely worth 18 million USD, and since ether is now trading at around 1.5 USD it has already netted presale investors a 5x gain.

There's no reason to clone/merge mine (trying to copy ethereum is useless because you'd lose all the existing contract and dapp infrastructure). 
All that will be needed for bitcoins to get full access to the ethereum ecosystem is a two way peg from the bitcoin blockchain to the main ethereum blockchain. This can likely only work from a technical point of view by using an intermediary sidechain, but from the point of view of an ordinary user it will just mean that there are now real bitcoins on ethereum, and that bitcoin can be seamlessly integrated in smart contracts alongside ether and all other ethereum assets.

You people are actually so dumb that ethereum terrifies you because you actually believe it will somehow hurt bitcoin. That's why you are up in arms with joy when you see this kind of insane censorship when nothing like it is being levied against blockstream, truthcoin, open transactions, payments platforms that integrate bitcoin etc. etc.
Btw you cannot possibly try to use occams razor to argue for ethereum being off-topic, since the only explanation for why it is off topic that has been presented so far is the blatant lie that ethereum isn't pegged to bitcoin or can be used as a payments platform/network. It literally can be used for both things out of the box with federated gateways and btcrelay, and will become a sidechain the moment sidechains actually come out. 
So right now we have an argument on one side, versus censorship explained by trivially disproven lies. Which one does occam's razor lean towards?

Reposting from below to see if anyone will dare respond, though I fully expect this is solely going to get downvoted/censored.
Just admit it. You are censoring ethereum related news for you own personal monetary gain just because you erroneously believe that it will damage your bitcoin investment. There was NEVER a post like this from a mod about greece, banks, inflation, argentina etc. Discriminating against ethereum is such blatant censorship for personal gain beyond anything that has happened on reddit before.
As a bitcoin user and investor who's also an ethereum investor, let me make it clear that you are 1) wrong about ethereum damaging bitcoin 2) a terrible person who's willing to abandon every single principle bitcoin is supposed to stand for, just so you'll be able to make more money (according to your backwards logic). The only thing that can be compared to this kind of behaviour is corrupt central banks taking control of the media. 
**So why isn't ethereum going to damage bitcoin?** Like everything else, the answer to this is sidechains. Ethereum will implement sidechains the moment they become available. Vitalik has stated this multiple times and many projects including my own have got confirmation from the devs personally that we will be able to use bitcoin on the ethereum blockchain alongside ether.
**Ethereum is just as relevant to bitcoin as any project that claims to be a sidechain, or claims to build sidechains, such as blockstream or truthcoin.**
Before sidechains even become available, there are going to be a major effort to create a decentralized federated BTC gateway using an x-of-x+1 multisig of all the major ethereum dapps, which will be almost as safe as a sidechain.
Ethereum is going to be the primary platform where bitcoin will see use in the future, it should be so obvious to anyone with half a brain. You're going to regret having been the moron that worked against this.
**also btcrelay allows any ethereum dapp to accept bitcoin as payment for its services from day 1** The code for this has already existed for almost a year. It has been tested and it works. You can see it right here, in the official ethereum github repo:  This is currently the closest thing that exists to a bitcoin sidechain - has blockstream even released any code whatsoever yet?

Such as, lets think of some examples out of the millions of usecases, dapps that take bitcoin or faster BTC payment networks built on ethereum, or stablecoins that are collateralized by bitcoin which is the project I'm working on.
Of course you are obviously terrified of it or you wouldn't go to these crazy lengths to censor every topic that even mentions it here, rather than just allow **users** to upvote downvote and thus choose their content, like the way it works for everything else. If you actually thought it was boring you'd not be afraid of letting it be voted on.

Where does adding bitcoin fit into this? Going from USD to bitcoin or the other direction adds a spread that's as high as CC fees, so considering that they're trying to get rid of fees it wouldn't really make sense.
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:55:52


Ethereum is a future sidechain (when sidechains actually happen - but blockstream and truthcoin posts are allowed here today), and it already has bitcoin SPV verification through btcrelay: 
This mod is deliberately posting lies to support his censorship agenda.

The multiple denominations thing is really good and makes this business super flexible. It means that bitcoin is really just being used as a convenient payment system for the type of nonrefundable transactions that are necessary for one time loans. I like it.
Next step would be to implement more payment methods to increase flexibility, assuming the owners aren't bitcoin maximalists. Just like there's no reason why lendingclub shouldn't also implement bitcoin alongside their other options, there's no reason why this company shouldn't also implement more options to expand their potential market.

Is it actually cheaper and faster to buy bitcoins, send them, and sell them again? Two local bank transfers might be faster than one international transfer, but i dont see how having to pay the btc spread twice can possibly be cheaper than the flat fee for swift transfers.

Wait, do you somehow have the idea that there will only be one place to download ethereum clients?
There's nothing preventing ethereum clients to be as diverse and from as many different sources as with bitcoin.
Again, client source centralization is as dangerous for bitcoin as for a PoS model. Adding the danger of compromised block chain hashes into the already existing danger of private key sniffers does not increase risk or required trust - either way the event that happens if a distributor is compromised is that your private keys are stolen.
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:06:35
It is so ridiculous to see them arguing "hurr durr it works, but it's not the same trust model as PoW".
If you cannot trust blockchain hashes from a source, then you also cannot trust software clients from that source. If the source of a PoS block chain client was compromised the attacker wouldn't bother changing the block chain hashes, he'd install a backdoor to steal your private keys. This is just as much of a risk if a PoW client source is compromised, so having weak subjectivity doesn't increase risk or change the trust model.
@_date: 2015-04-28 10:50:41
True. This is good advice and im happy to see reason on this subreddit. People also need to realise that you can cheer on the success of bitcoin and even help it gain traction and adoption, without having to gamble your life savings on it. "investing" in bitcoin doesnt actually help bitcoin at all, it just makes the other gamblers richer. Generally speculating on highly volatile assets should only be done by professionals who specialize in speculation and know what they are getting into.

This is what makes it so dangerous and why many people here have such a hard time seeing that theyre not "investors", theyre ludomaniacs. Because even the HYIP/"to the moon" message is clouded by the fanatical idea that bitcoin needs to save the world from [insert conspiracy]. Suddenly high-risk gambling on bitcoin becomes a part of the very identity of the people who do it.

I hate these stupid social darwinism arguments. You're getting darwinism wrong. What makes humans fitter as groups is the fact that they can warn each others of the dangers without having to sustain losses.

@_date: 2015-03-10 18:13:23


This isn't actually a solution, this is just the current situation which makes escrow deals impossible for anything without high margins. If one party has to take on the risk of volatility the other party can decide whether to honor the deal or not to get the most favorable rate. To prevent this bond requirements would have to be prohibitively high, once again making it useless for anything that isn't drug trade.
Of course in your cultist mind being unable to use bitcoin for trade due to the crippling volatility is my own fault, not the fault of bitcoin. Because bitcoin is perfect and flawless.

Can this method be used to make ether transactions private? The issue as I see it is that to transfer ether or metacoins the user will always need to send a normal transaction, and someone who verifies that transaction will be able to tell the sender, the amount and the receiver from that transaction if the EVM is also meant to be able to tell these things. It would be really awesome if contracts + whisper could be used for easy coinjoin and stealth transactions, but I'm wondering if it's possible to get fully opaque privacy like monero or shadowcash has through cleverly made contracts somehow.

There is a middle ground using ethereum style smart contracts. You can have a multisig with withdrawal limits.
Your own key can only withdraw 10% per day.
Your own key + coinbase key can withdraw 100% per day.
coinbase key can withdraw 1% per day.
With this system, if your private key is stolen the thief will only be able to steal 10% of your funds before you contact coinbase and move all your funds to another private key.
If coinbase steals your money they can only take 10% before you've removed all yourself because your single-key withdrawal speed is 10 times higher.
If you lose your key you can contact coinbase and get your money back over a period of 100 days.

Decentralized, fungible USD/CNY/gold/silver/EUR CFD's without counterparty risk.
A DAC is the perfect place to trade derivatives. Extremely low fees. You can see the rules right there in the source code. It's literally impossible for you as a trader to lose or owe anything more than your principal.
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:11:18
That will also be good enough. The biggest problem is the onramping - getting in to crypto from fiat, and that's where localbitoins and bitsquare is perfect. Once you're in you can use bitshares, a fully decentralized exchange that allows you to trade bitcoin for bitusd with 10 second block times. Using bridges such as shapeshift.io it's really simple to your bitcoins on and off the exchange, and at no point in time do you have to do any sort of identity verification or have someone else hold your bitcoins or bitusd.
It's seriously gonna be huge for bitcoin once the web interface is out, then it will feel just like any other centralized exchange except that you can't get goxed.

The point is that compared to other assets, such as the USD, bitcoin is orders of magnitudes more volatile to the point where it becomes useless for any deals without extremely high margins (such as drug deals).

The fact that an alt is going to succeed bitcoin is obvious to anyone with any knowledge of tech adoption (first iteration of a technology cannot preempt its own flaws).
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:47:04
Another thing is that bitcoin can also begin to use bitshares account registration system, since bitcoin and bitshares private keys are the same. So people can register their bitcoin addresses on the bitshares blockchain and then we can begin sending bitcoins to names instead of hashes. This is another thing that I see making bitcoin a lot more accessible to the mainstream.

The block chain would be distributed amongst everyone, but the mining rights would be held by several central banks. The advantage is that in this system the average user can transact money directly and instantly with the central bank, instead of having to go through a retail bank.
People will be able to transact real money as easily and cheaply as they do bitcoin, but with consumer protection and legal oversight. Everyone in the world would conclude this is a fantastic thing, everyone but you. You're just pissed that your bitcoin bags now have even less of a chance of becoming worth anything.
Like a true bitcoin cultist the only thing that matters about bitcoin and bitcoin technology is that it's supposed to make you rich.

Lol. They just blocked their competitors product on their own platform. See how amazing and wonderful the free market is?

So people send bitcoin to you, that you then sell on bitfinex, and later when they want their bitcoin back you buy them back on bitfinex. Why not just send bitcoins directly to bitfinex and avoid paying fees to your business? That way they can even earn interest from providing swap liquidity.

But why....?
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:09:47
The price stability of BitUSD does not come from an algorithm, it comes from the market, and that's why it cannot be gamed or exploited. The free market fully decides the supply of BitUSD so that the price is always close to 1 USD, because free market participants have to enter into collateralized CFD contracts to create new bitUSD, and these contracts can only be done at a value determined by a decentralized price feed. So bitUSD can be freely traded, but it can only be created by someone putting up 300% collateral in BTS at a value so the bitUSD price becomes 1 USD worth of BTS.
It works pretty well, even during the latest crash. 
You can read the technical details in the whitepaper:

The key is the splitting feature. And then some mechanism to hold other tokens, so you can use it as an investment vehicle.

This is actually good news!!

Why do you think that others would sell? If they notice someone is attempting to accumulate 51% of the stake they will be incentivized to hold and wait for the price to increase to absurdly inflated levels, even if the blockchain market cap was originally close to zero. Additionally the tokens on adept will likely mostly be held by machines that arent even able to sell their tokens.
Ultimately 51% attacking a pos chain also can never make economic sense because by definition you will always be hurting yourself more than everyone else combined. Should you manage to accumulate a 51% stake and manage stop block production it will be trivial for those who remain to fork the chain with all of your malicous stake removed from the genesis block, completely mitigating your attack while still pocketing the huge amounts of money you had to pay to accumulate a 51% stake.

Youre joking, right?
You think anything is ever going to happen with them? True trendon shavers did get caught and hopefully gets punished, and maybe mark will get some punishment. All the others are scot free, and all of them get to keep the bitcoins they stole from us.

By attempting to buy up 51% of the coins the attacker will create the high market cap on their own. You are assuming all coins are just sitting around on exchanges ready to be sold but it is rarely more than 5% of total supply that is even for sale. So then the only option for the attacker is to offer absurdly high prices that makes coin owners move their coins on to the exchanges to sell. However since they'll know it's an attack they will be incentivized to wait since the attacker will be forced to always bid higher and higher or abandon their attack.

Right, so lets put everything on halt and then revisit bitcoin in 10 years.

Altcoins dont have to compete with bitcoin. For instance bitshares will soon release the HedgeWallet, a bitcoin wallet that combines the best of both worlds, allowing you to send and receive bitcoin but can tie their value to USD or gold while you hold it. All this can be done without AML, no registration of any kind and there is only miniscule counterparty risk at the moment of transfer. All your money will be owned and held by your own private keys as either bitcoin, bitUSD or bitgold...
This kind of decentralized price hedging might finally help to make bitcoin go viral in the developing world where people dont have access to banks, but also need something to protect them against the volatility bitcoin normally has.
@_date: 2015-02-08 08:35:50
Because bitcoin has become a cult centered around the belief that all those people you see posting here on reddit will one day be able to buy their own private islands if they just HODL and buy cheap coinz!
Youll notice that they hate altcoins even more than they hate fiat because they see altcoins as an evil and dishonest threat to their rightfully deserved millions.
Meanwhile ripple is being adopted by several real banks banks and ethereum is being adopted by IBM.

I don't know, the 100k newly mined coins that get dumped per month to pay for electricity costs probably have some negative effect.

It's amazing many bitcoiners haven't realized that pow is 100% dead. No new blockchains use pow. Ethereum isn't going to use pow. Adept isn't going to use pow. Pos can keep the network fully secure even if monetary value is low or zero, as long as initial distribution is decentralized.

Problem is that people who like/trust bitcoin will automatically hate all other instances of the same technology due to the incentives involved. So most people who hold bitcoin will always hate bitUSD even if they could benefit from using it rather than exposing themselves to counterparty risk with fiat IOU's.

If you want to give your wallet something unique to offer its users, then you could consider supporting bitUSD through shapeshift. That way your users will have the option to store their bitcoin as bitUSD, shielding them from volatility, but the moment they want to pay something or send the bitcoin out of their wallet they are instantly converted back from bitUSD to bitcoin through shapeshift and sent to the specified bitcoin address.
In short you can easily give your clients the option of a decentralized, AML free coinbase USD wallet.
