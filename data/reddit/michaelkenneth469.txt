Too true.

Correlation does not equal causation. You haven't provided any evidence of causation. In fact you haven't even provide any strong evidence of correlation. Node numbers may have gone down because it is considerably easier to simply use mobile wallets.

Tell me, what is even the point bitcoin being used in this new system you are pushing for? It is literally identical to the system we have right now.

The more transactions, the bigger the network effect and the larger the number of users and therefore the larger the number of nodes.

What is this short=motivated 51% attack?


So you want miners to earn less. Got it. So how are you going to make miners earn less?


It would be great for who, in what way? Who are the customers of bitcoin in this new environment you are pushing for?


Doing 10 transactions would cost $6250. How is that efficient?


I think what you mean is a 'Satoshi'. I'm not sure why you can't say his/her/their name. A satoshi is 100,000,000th of a bitcoin. i.e. .00000001btc. That is 5000x larger than 0.00005btc.


Your definition of 'tiny' is arbitrary.


What you want is an altcoin. You should read the bitcoin white paper. It's called "Bitcoin: A peer to peer electronic cash system. The entire introduction repeats multiple times on the importance of removing trusted 3rd parties from a transaction. What you are describing is exactly the opposite thing bitcoin was designed as. What you have described is quite literally the current banking system.


You've not understood/listened. Lightning transactions are only secure based on the fact that they can be published to the blockchain when necessary. If the transaction fee is equal to or larger than the transaction and the transaction needs securing then the transaction is not secure at all because the failsafe is worthless.

We know how transaction fees will work with larger block size *limits* because bitcoin had a much larger block size limit relative to the actual block size for most of its history.
We also know what has to happen to fees if you want to replace the subsidy with then *"soon". 12.5btc per block X $900 = $11,250 being earned right now per block. You can fit roughly 2000 standard transactions in a block, therefore the fee on a single transaction will need to go up to $11,250/2000 = $5.63. That's if you want to replace them "soon". 
That also ignores the fact that we want the bitcoin price to increase significantly if we want bitcoin to be successful and the requirement on fees increases proportionally. A $10,000 bitcoin will require a transaction fee of $62.50 and a $100,000 bitcoin will require a transaction fee of $625.00.
The Lightning Network's security model fails in a high fee environment because the security comes from being able to settle the transaction **on* the blockchain. This means a real bitcoin transaction needs to be made. If the cost of the bitcoin transaction fee is equal to or more than the amount been sent then the transaction has no security. If the cost of the bitcoin transaction fee is close to the amount being sent then the transaction has little security.

Businesses are users. Businesses are users with more to lose than individual users.

That 'equally long list' is not a list of people who will support the core side of the fork. It is just a list of businesses who have no said anything at all.

All businesses are by definition 'centralised services'. Are you saying that businesses don't matter?
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:25:30
Do you have a reason to be militantly against a block size increase?
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:41:20
Yeh, fuck the entire bitcoin economy!
