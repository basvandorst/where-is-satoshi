Not sure about this specific case, but Banks are usually very bad at upgrades.  Many of their systems were build in-house like 10 or 20 years ago, are archaic and don't use DevOps style best practices.  Banks still run mainframes.

Banks want every coin to disappear especially coins that will be successful.  If you are involved in a crypto business be prepared to get whacked by your bank.  Having a key dependency on traditional banking in a crypto business is dangerous and should be avoided.

"I don’t need to know the specifics of how this transitions unfolds, just that it will. This is why it makes sense to own **bitcoin** and gold, two politically neutral alternative global monetary instruments **that’ll likely trade multiples higher from here in the years ahead** as people come to recognize the importance of such assets in the historical transition period we’re in."

He is following the Morgan Stanley corporate line.  Even though you will see endless reports about institutional interest in bitcoin the global investment banks don't like bitcoin.  Their main interest in bitcoin is to work to make it go away.  If you like working there and want to have an easy time then find a way to slander bitcoin and other crypto currencies. 
When you hear... \* Bitcoin doesn't comply with our regulations so it is criminal.  \* Bitcoin has no intrinsic value (only sovereign nations can create coins) \* Bitcoin uses too much energy. \* Or Jamie Dimon's bitcoin is a fraud.

Jamie "bitcoin is a fraud" Dimon didn't know a thing about the criminal activity.  He was in too busy in Washington paying off the right people, so him and the real fraudsters working for him will be held in high esteem.

Dollar Tumbles On Speculation Trump To Announce FX Intervention "Shortly"

"Agents found **$7,300** on flight attendant Miaria Delpilar Roman-Strick and **$6,371** on Maria Isabel Wilson-Ossandon, the report said."
Not sure why they had the money on them, but man this is scary.  First off this isn't a lot of money, we aren't talking global crime syndicate here.  Many people could be bringing this  amount of money back to pay for necessities, like rent, tuition, whatever.  Also, the money was confiscated.  I mean what if it is their money and they need it to live.
The amount of control we as a free people have given to banks and the government is unacceptable.  **Long live Bitcoin!**
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:23:29
It gives you full control over the money you own and doesn't allow the govt to devalue what you posses.
Even though many of us feel like we are free, have freedom of speech, are free to live where we want etc...  We have completely given up freedom to do what we want with our money.  Try to send a relative money and immediately you are interrogated as a money laundering, tax evading terrorist.  Bring more that a couple of thousand dollars on an international flight and be prepared to have it seized at the gate.  We as a free people need to fight to take back control of our money.  Believe in sound money - Believe in Bitcoin.

That's why so much really serious, global, criminal activity uses bags of dollars.  They are very hard to trace and can be manufactured when needed.  Next time you hear someone doing the usual bashing of Bitcoin because of some bullshit argument about criminal activity, remind them of how the most horrific and serious, global crimes are dollar denominated.  If anything Bitcoin will make these activities much harder.  Probably another reason the banksters hate Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:39:48
Right now you'd still be getting in early.  The entire crypto-market is still only a small fraction of the more mature financial markets.  It will eventually be the primary global financial market.  How long will that take?  I don't know.  But, it certainly is not too late to get in now.

Fed is talking right now about expanding balance sheet again.  This is partially to alleviate recent issue in the overnight lending (Repo) markets.  This has taken equities off of the lows for the day.  BTC isn't moving in response.
But, in a world where interest rates keep plummeting and balance sheets keep expanding, being in Bitcoin seems like the way to go.

The US Bank in question is JPM.  
According to the DOJ the plaintive learned how to spoof, "from more senior traders, and spoofed with the knowledge and consent of his supervisors."  I am sure Jamie Dimon was busy paying people off (excuse me, lobbying) in Washington and knew nothing about it.

Here are more details and a few things to think about.
Jamie's views on bitcoin are not worth taking seriously mainly because he represents the false narrative that bitcoin is a fraud.  Wall Street firms have a very anti crypto stance, it is unregulated, grew out of the internet in a way they can't control and is something they would very much like to see just go away, but they can't figure out how to kill it.  Bitcoin is "Rat poison squared" and Jamie and team are the rats.
One ironic thing here, is that most of the real fraud is happening under the watch of people like Mr. Dimon.  The "we have a few bad apples, but aren't rotten to the core." narrative is how they explain this.  But, looks like the core might be a bit rotten too.  The senior people also like to pretend they had no idea it was happening.  I mean how could we expect Jamie to know his head of metals trading was running a fraudulent operation.  Jamie was too busy taking care of the politicians and regulators and there isn't enough time in the day to oversee your fraudulent business operations.
The other ironic thing is that a world economy based on crypto currencies has a good chance to eliminate many of these fraudulent practices by eliminating people like Jamie and most of his firm.  A key vision of crypto is to eliminate the fraudulent middlemen.

Sure, I keep seeing that in the news, but none of the major institutional players, like JPM, MS, GS, are going anywhere near it.  If anything they are still on a mission to kill it, or are ignoring it hoping it goes away.  I'd be interested to know who these institutional investors are.  Some smaller hedge funds maybe?  Do you know any of them?

This is money going to support the repo markets (overnight repurchase agreements).  It will have a stabilizing effect by reducing dollar funding issues at large financial institutions.  It will not devalue the dollar and should not affect Bitcoin prices.
The interesting question here is why is dollar funding becoming scarce?  Issues similar to this triggered the 2008 financial crisis.  So, if this continues it could have a big positive impact on crypto markets.  Worth keeping an eye on this.

Kind of concerning how people in the crypto world, like Pomp, are all starting threads about how the market is being flooded with dollars, dollar printing presses are in overdrive, BTC going to moon any second now.
