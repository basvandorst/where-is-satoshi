it is actually really quick once you have your identification done theres a lot out there ready to invest even at lower rates. I got a 1.5btc loan @ 20x to be paid 1st of the month should have paid 1.8btc on 1st however was broke till pay on the thursday so ended up paying 2.3btc from my 1.5btc. However I dont see how you couldnt just fraud everything :\ 
my 17 cents worth.
