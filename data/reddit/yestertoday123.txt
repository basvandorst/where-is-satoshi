They work out how much you made off of it at the time and then bill you for that amount. If USD doesn't exist anymore, they will make you pay the equivalent in BTC.

lol Bitcoin itself is not even stable

There are plenty of educational resources on Reddit, including on the sidebar of this sub in case you didn't notice. Not everybody is just automatically born with 100% knowledge of how Bitcoin works like you were. And also not everybody wants to learn about Bitcoin just so they can invest and make money off of it like apparently you see it. You realise there is a lot more to cryptocurrency than just mooning and buying a lambo right?
Would you rather people were going to Bitcoin.com to learn about it? Or Google it and click on the first thing they see which will inevitably be a CNN news article?
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:55:21
Exactly. The whole concept of cryptocurrency that everyone creams their pants over is that it doesn't have a boss, or a CEO, or someone that runs things. Consensus is king, and consensus has spoken.

The one where your allies let you use their countries as forward operating bases so that you can pressure the Russians into doing whatever you want. Except that doesn't matter anymore because your president is compromised by the Russians and is bending to their will anyway haha how embarrassing.

Worries, yeah. But Roger Ver, etc actually do make money from shilling and pumping and dumping BCash. And apparently, everyone over at r/BTC is fine with that.
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:16:30
Why would I use Bitcoin to buy my coffee though when I could just use my credit card or cash? I own Bitcoin and I'd still use cash. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 06:48:06
lol what? Trump is currently destroying even the good relations the US has. The world is losing more respect for the US every day, and no matter how strong you think the US is, any strong nation relies on trade. Your steel industry and small businesses are getting fucked over by him as we speak lol
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:53:13


They literally say "Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin."
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:57:29
No we wouldn't, because Roger Ver's Bitcoin.com and his army of shills pump millions of dollars into misleading people and scamming them out of their money.
@_date: 2018-08-03 01:30:03
The Donald Trump of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-08-31 04:11:02
Right now, yes. I think the point was that once everyone is using Bitcoin, nobody will have to pay companies like WU and banks to be able to send people money.
@_date: 2018-08-03 01:29:45
Not necessarily. Someone that is new to Bitcoin and user Reddit regularly would probably come here at some point to learn a few things, so it's worth educating them. Hopefully they wouldn't go straight to Bitcoin(dot)com and put their money into whatever they read on there.
@_date: 2018-10-24 04:01:24
What kind of players? I haven't been keeping upto date with crypto news lately haha just hodling
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:03:39
In an infinite (or even just long) timescale, won't all BTC eventually be lost?
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:25:28
It's all about who can shout their accusations louder. I could be a massive criminal, but if I can point the finger at someone else for being the criminal, people will trust me.
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:49:20
Yeah they have, but only half-arsedly. If more people start transferring millions though they will take it seriously and launch a full on attack on crypto. 
Not sure people are downvoting lol it's a legitimate concern. I think people just live in a fairytale world where the government and banks will just angrily shake their fists at crypto instead of actually try to regulate it. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:15:37
The government won't like this though. Won't things like this prompt them to try and regulate crypto? All they have to do is have the newspapers print "CRYPTO ALLOWS TERRORISTS TO SEND EACH OTHER MONEY!" and there you have it, the whole world turns against crypto and the government wins?
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:48:31
Wouldn't it have to be regulated before big businesses start accepting and holding it? I can't see any huge company's compliance and finance departments allowing them to do that with a currency that is open to being manipulated so easily. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:36:12
Make it illegal to use it? Make a list of 'acceptable' currencies that people are allowed to use. It might not stop me and you from giving each other $5, but I doubt they care about that. It would stop all businesses from using it, all vendors from accepting it though. The general public isn't going to bother ditching their bank account and credit card for something that's illegal and they can't even use anyway.
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:56:25
Same with diamonds. Apart from their use in drills and tech, diamonds are only sought after because they're shiny and companies like De Beers tell women that they should buy them (or make their fiancees spend 3 months salary on them). 
In the event of a major crisis or depression, people aren't going to want shiny rocks, they're going to want food on their table. And if the De Beers stockpiling warehouses were raided and the market flooded with all those diamonds, everyone would realise that they're not actually special or rare at all. Anyone hodling diamonds for their value would be rekt. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 04:40:13
Or AmEx will be twice the fee to use. I've always wondered why.
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:17:18
Will this just be an exchange or something moving their holdings? Or is it an actual person? How do you know?
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:02:40
Does the receiving party need to have it as well?
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:28:01
Black market drugs are illegal. You go to jail if you deal them. Yeah crypto is fine for black market transactions now, but if the government was to make it illegal, your local supermarket isn't going to risk accepting it. And 99% of the population would actively avoid it. Just like they do with black market drugs. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:37:43
Diamonds aren't even rare tho. They're relatively worthless. It's just market and price manipulation that makes them expensive. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 04:44:11
It's adoption in general that will slowly fuck the banks. Though personally, I don't think that banks/governments will let themselves be fucked. They have endless money to address that if it ever becomes a problem.
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:04:06


Exactly. People whinging because it's not mass adopted RIGHT NOW lol be patient.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:30:38
Don't you think that eventually the government would want to get rid of cash altogether though? The federal agencies would absolutely love that. I'm pretty sure someone would have at least considered the idea. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but within 100 years or so. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:38:27
Depending on who it is that's transferring the funds, I imagine at least part of it will be converted to fiat at some point. Whether through an exchange, or over the counter, etc. Couldn't the government just keep an eye on the addresses, and as soon as they hit an exchange, just subpoena the exchange to obtain the name of the seller?
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:00:20
Those who have any sense and value anonymity and privacy generally make a new Reddit account every now and then so they're not just building an online profile for themselves under one account. Personally I don't want my friends or family or anyone stumbling upon my Reddit account and being able to see years worth of my post/comment history. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:04:09
Trump detected
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:05:18
Yes, up and down in relation to other currencies. Not to goods. USD value is going up and down but your local dealership isn't changing the USD value of a Lambo from day to day is it? If BTC was the sole currency, a loaf of bread is going to cost 0.0001BTC or whatever every day, assuming the economy is stable.
People are only losing money because they ultimately want to convert their BTC back to fiat, so that is what they're judging it against.
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:04:41
Well yeah the $10 for lunch thing was just an example. I meant just for p2p transfers in general. Like maybe you pay your landlord for rent or something. I assumed banks would just have free transfers with online banking. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:51:28
A shitcoin is one with no uses that nobody wants. If it's stable and has a valid use then it's hardly a shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:45:37
Nothing is credible when it comes to predicting crypto. The minute anyone thinks they can accurately predict the price 6 months away, is when you know they're talking out of their ass.
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:05:09
Which country exactly would you say is trustworthy? USA?
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:46:20
My wife and I swap out the shit for mashed bananas.
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:08:57
That's an international transfer though, I thought we were talking about domestic ones. I assumed they were free in most countries. But yes, with my old UK bank you would get a discount when doing international transfers online instead of in person or over the phone. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 06:02:30
Because i'm not in the US, could you explain this? If you want to send $10 to your friend to cover half the lunch bill, you have to pay $30 in charges? Even if you just do it through the online banking app on your phone?
@_date: 2018-07-05 05:57:47
That's all government law though. The bank would be shut down if it didn't play by those rules. 
If there were no federal laws concerning KYC and terrorism, banks wouldn't give a flying shit where you got your money from and what you did with it. They would let store it with them no questions asked.
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:54:39
Anyone who values personal privacy makes a new account every few months. I've been posting on Reddit for 5 years and I've only got a 1 month rank, so what?
@_date: 2018-07-05 06:00:21
You lost 75% in relation to fiat. I think the ultra scenario that people want is that there is no fiat, and Bitcoin is the main currency. In which case it wouldn't have lost any value. For example 1BTC would get you a lambo today and tomorrow. Because their base price would be in BTC, not fiat.
