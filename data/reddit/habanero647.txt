Now you've verified your indeed trolling by changing the subject, apparently in an attempt to not recognize the truth, which is the valid and logical argument/evidence I've presented (in my last comment) which perfectly refutes your groundless claim. Please address what I've presented in my last comment or I will not continue to "feed the troll"

CCN had reported it, arent they one of the big crypto news sites?

Right, I appreciate your input, what is the best way to handle this after the fact?  In our defense it says "reportedly" and we added an "edit" which explains the relevant facts of the current situation.

I question your authenticity as you discredited yourself here, perhaps your just trolling?  Anyone who reads the last few (or better yet 50 for the sake of a decent sample size) of just the titles of our news stories, would be lying if they said its not informative.  At least 98% are high content quality, if not 100%.

I like those sites that show you whats most profitable to mine based on your hardware.  Ive never heard of Ravecoin but you seem to have a good strategy as alts seem to be more volatile lately (upwards and downwards) so I think you'd have to have good timing to pull out at the peak?  Regarding hodling, didn't Charlie Lee say (paraphrasing) to hodl BTC above all other coins?  I know some Bitcoin dev advocated on twitter to spend BTC (or even spend via credit card and then pay cc balance with BTC) but then 100% replenishing monthly.  Earning and living off crypto seems game theory optimal :) [

Are you aware that big crypto news sites had published the Musk story? For example, CCN.  Paraphrasing is a feature to save you time, so you can just look at the title and not need to read the article, or read our shorter version of the article, with the source available if you prefer the long form story.

I should have been more clear, I was referring to the fake news story about "not a flamethowers" for sale for Bitcoin
