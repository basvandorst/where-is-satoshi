Btc was the first and basically opened up Pandoras box. What becomes of it is anyones guess. I personally believe that it will eventually stabilize itself and become a sort "gold" where all other coins will use it as a form of backing. I will say that I believe in more of the technology that's coming out with xrp,Ada, and iota than btc itself and see a more profitable future with the alt coins.

ADA, XRP, IOTA to begin. You can do some research to find out which technology you believe in

My area allows me to use binance for alt coins. I know there's a couple of other ones but that's the one I'm familiar with

This is under the assumption that the powers at be have nothing to do with btc or any currency. If we imagine that they owned or even created cryptocurrencies than we begin to think of how this might actually happen and work. Like people say any publicity is good publicity. The fact btc has become something mainstream is talking about should tell you how successful it has been and can be ultimately

Well either gdax or Coinbase restrict you for the time being to only buy btc, eth, and ltc. Binance and other places allow you the ability to purchase alt coins if that's what you're asking

Yes for those 3 coins gdax and Coinbase will work perfectly. Alt coins usually are referred as penny stocks and such. The 3 you mentioned are pretty much big time.  Id also recommend looking into cheaper alt coins as you'll be able to make more of a profit. Keep in mind it is more of a risk tho!

Man if you believe in the technology, the vision, and the ultimate goal then the only way to go is to  and reinvest more. Cryptocurrencies are longterm and when you understand that, you won't be scared to see occasional dips or "experts" acting like chicken little.

Best way to go is to diversify and go into some alt coins. That will make your profits really play and possibly make you alot more. I'd recommend ADA, XRP, IOTA  some have already had a burst but still have potential for more ����

People that share in your opinion are the reason the market is so volatile. People who truly believe in the product know that this is a way of destroying the thieves we have running our banking system. Before long the masses will no longer trust banks that hold all power over money YOU earned. Go try depositing a million cash to a bank and go back the next day asking for it and see how that goes.

You must have put nothing in and think it isn't a challenge. Put some real money up and then tell me it that it's easy to keep adding money to that

I would say to remember that the relationship between btc and alt is not always symbiotic. There are time where money is flooding into btc and the alts are bleeding because the money is being taken out of alts to go into btc. I just see an influx of money to both sides which is causing everything to be positive atm

Man oh man. I'm so excited for the future. This literally reminds me when Bryant gumble was on air asking "what's the internet!?" Gentlemen our time is here. Get ready for the next 1-3 years cause this ride is gonna be a fun one. Btw I loved every single response that guy had to say. He was spot on about everything

They are lying in our faces. This guy Kevin has been spotted on record as talking about btc even as far back as 2013. Market manipulation at its finest. Bet you he filled his pockets nicely on this last dip

I would challenge you by saying either master card or visa currently pays for you and they deduct the denomination is usd from your account. I see hardly any difference

Not sure what you mean by open source but I myself use mycelium and so far so good
