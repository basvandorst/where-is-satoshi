people cant handle the reality of the situation. there is a mathematical proof in that article but people just dont wanna hear it

Shhhh you can't say that here

I will probably get downvoted for mentioning the name, but ethereum 2.0 has a cool feature to prevent centralization of pools. When a node goes offline it get penalized relative to the total number of offline nodes. This disencentivises large pools because they lose more if they go down due to a network outage, server error etc.

I think you have some misunderstandings there...

Eos is shit, yes. But to say it competes with aws shows a complete lack of understanding about what either of those things are

god they need a new UI designer so bad

I just think the purple and white scheme is super ugly. I guess I am referring mostly to the graphic design. It looks very dot-com-era-esque.

It is very bad coffee. They intentionally overcook their beans so that that no matter which Starbucks you go to it always tastes the same. This makes it always tastes burnt. They usually cover it up with sugar and flavoring but if you get the basic coffee it is not very good.

I would love to pay my friends in crypto but it's hard to get people on board with $10  tx fees

It's not about about everybody reading every line. It's about having more eyes on the code. It helps with deliberately malicious software. People will notice a crypto miner or keylogger in software and report it. I often browse through code and if I find suspicious code I report it. Open source is important in the same way that transparency in government is.

Really cool idea and it first it seems viable. The thing that makes this tricky is it dosent fundamentally change the complexity of the bruteforce problem. So if you pick a strong or weak password, it is only more difficult to bruteforce by a constant factor. This means that over time as computers speed up, the time to bruteforce this will approach the same time as if there were only a single hash on the password. This means your keys will become less secure (down to the strength of the password) over long periods of time.

Haha good one

People here hate to hear it and plug their ears but Bitcoin is way more traceable than fiat

How is trezor, the oldest and most reliable wallet not listed?
@_date: 2019-05-17 00:17:09
So to be clear, you think high tx fees are a good thing?

Btc got choked at the same time last year so it seems a little bit unfair to call eth a scam because of that. They are different projects with different goals and implementations. Each one is better at different things.
