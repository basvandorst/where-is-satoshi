A central bank can control any arbitrary percentage of its currency that it likes simply by printing more of it and devaluing it.  This is the appeal of a currency with a fixed issuance schedule.

They're the worst, particularly when they try to get people to think inflation (i. e., the devaluation of the purchasing power of the fruits of their labor) is good.
Inevitably the word "modern" makes an appearance ("modern economics") as does "incentive to spend".  They pretend that the past 40 years (rampant inflation, plus a further widening of the gap between the hyper-rich and everyone else) are how things should be in perpetuity.
Finally an alternative to precious metals has come along, and with it all kinds of possibilities, and I'm excited about it.

It reminds me of the mobile phone "feature" of automatically connecting you to outside networks (at hidden, exorbitant rates) when traveling to foreign countries so that you "never miss a call".

I just read a book called "The Curse of Cash" in which an economics professor one-sidedly praises the glorious future in which continuous inflation, negative interest rates, seigniorage, and of course the abolition of cash are all desirable "tools" for our government overlords to manage the economy for their benefit (and to the working class' detriment).
It was *terrifying*.  And he even flipped us the bird by bringing up the bacteria that can be spread through physical coins and bills, as if the public would suddenly be so afraid of that health hazard that they would gleefully give up the last vestiges of currency being money.

So far I have supported ᛋ (futhark S, and it looks like a lightning bolt), �� (white on black circled S), Ⓢ (black on white circled S), ⓢ (same, small s), and ㋚ (circled Japanese katakana "sa").
But I'm digging that Š with a second under-haček attached at the bottom, because "under-haček" is a word we need to say more often.

Over on another thread I suggested using [the futhark letter S]( which looks just like a lightning bolt.
@_date: 2019-03-03 11:24:48
I like OP's sign, but here are some existing possibilities: �� (white on black circled S), Ⓢ (black on white circled S), ⓢ (same, small s), ㋚ (the Japanese phonetic *katakana* "sa", the initial sound in "satoshi").
@_date: 2019-03-04 02:26:27
Here's another option: the futhark letter S, which looks like this: ᛋ .  We're already using a variation of the futhark letter B (ᛒ) for bluetooth, and the ᛋ even looks kind of like a lightning bolt, emphasizing the lightning speed that we hope to have.  (And fans of Kiss will like it.)

"Eth" is already a letter, not-Vitalik; it is the sound that begins *this, that,* and *the* (ðis, ðat, and ðe)).  The Doge people are using the capital one so maybe Ethereum can use the lowercase: **ð**.
Or we could use thorn (**þ**), because the sound shows up in the word "eþereum".
Actually, a serious answer is that -- on my exchange at least -- Ethereum is indicated with the Greek letter xi (Ξ), perhaps because it looks like an E with the left side cut off.  The Chinese/Japanese numeral 3 (三) might also do the job.

"Everybody's Bitcoin" is being integrated into the family of payment-related companies, on an equal level with Edy, rather than being a subsidiary of the credit card subcompany.
Edy is a near-ubiquitous digital payment system in Japan.  If people could pay with bitcoin one-tenth as easily as they could pay with Edy, bitcoin's popularity would explode.

OP, please don't do this.  Your chances of success are not 99%.  BTC has seen parabolic gains over the past year and could go higher still, but then again it could crash and you would be stuck not only losing the value of what you invested, but also paying off a loan that would have interest attached to it.  (You're getting a good interest rate, by historical standards.  But it's still money you don't have.)
Only invest what you can afford to lose, as the saying goes.  Put some pocket money into BTC and if you make more, great.  I myself have only been in for a month or so and have made about $50 on my $2000 stake.  I would have made even more if I had not sold parts of my holdings every time the investment went up by a certain amount, to lock in profits.  But with an investment this volatile, it can never hurt to look for safety where you can find it.  
(Also, when people are talking about borrowing money to invest in something, surely that means the top is in, or close.)

"Bit" for one-eighth of a byte was directly inspired by the much older "bit" that is one-eighth of a dollar.  
People still knew about this usage until pretty recently; I remember Stan Lee describing a 75-cent comic book as "six bits" in the 1980s.

@_date: 2018-02-01 14:37:09


That wouldn't happen; putting off your purchase means losing the utility of having it longer.  Phones and computers, whose prices fall faster than any deflation rate seen in a national currency, still sell well because people want to use products *today* and not tomorrow or a month from now.
The deflation rate would have to be ridiculously high for people to put off purchases.  If you can buy a new car for $10,000 today and $9,000 a month from now, maybe then deflation is a problem.

According to ECB policy, a euro today is worth *at most* a euro tomorrow, because they explicitly plan to devalue their currency by 0-2% per year.  This is a slow-motion disaster for savers (spare us the "incentive to spend" inflationist pablum) but absolutely wonderful for the issuer of the euro, which can run up debts in it and then pay them off in devalued money, leaving them "holding the bag".  To whom does the ECB owe debts?  That's *you*, diligent saver with euro in the bank.

This sounds like hairsplitting, but it really isn't: the traditional economics-101 definition of "money" is "a store of value", and the central banks have switched what our wages are paid in into something that, at their design, does *not* hold value but rather *loses* value at up to about 2% per year, in an effort to get people to not save and rather to over-consume and to put their 'money' at risk.
Post anything about how inflation hurts the working class and you'll get someone who supports the central banks telling you that "currency is not meant to be saved; it is meant to be spent"; "a dollar is not money; it is a unit of account" and other things like that.  
If the ECB and other central banks had done what they claimed was the purpose of fiat money (expanding and contracting the money supply at appropriate times to keep prices from either falling or rising), it would be fair to everyone.  But that's not what they have done: they make sure that consumer prices *always rise* and that people's savings *always devalue*; just not so quickly that we have pitchforks and torches at their office doors.  
This confers great advantages on people who are rich and connected and who can afford to put their savings at risk, and who can borrow cheaply.  The majority of wage earners do not have these advantages, and have to fight tooth and nail just to get their wages to rise along with consumer prices.
I am eager to see cryptocurrency find a steady value instead of gyrating all over the place, so that people can use it to save their earnings without the risk that the central banks require us to take when saving unless we want to lose 0-2% of our purchasing power every year.

I like yyyy-mm-dd as much as the next guy, but with m/d/y Americans are just retaining established usage from when they were part of the British empire.  Google for "american colonial era newspaper" and you'll see all the dates are of the "January 1, 1752" style.

That place can be pretty funny at times, but the "useful idiots" who shill for the debasement of fiat currency (it can't really be called "money" if so) on the grounds that it gives wage earners and savers an "incentive" to spend more than they might want to made me want to tear my hair out.  It's like they're *trying* to swing people right past the ideal concept of fiat money (in which policy is used to keep purchasing power steady) all the way across the field to the crypto side.  Maybe they're double agents.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:47:07
No, only rarely.  In America we usually say "January first, seventeen-fifty-two" though "the first of January" isn't wrong or even strange, particularly if it were used in something like "I'll have to work on the 29th, 30th, 31st, and the 1st of January" where the speaker starts out omitting the month because the listener knows it's in December.
So as you note, we usually write it in the order we say it.  This is one reason I think yyyy-mm-dd is having trouble catching on; there is no normal-sounding way (at least in my northeastern American English) to say it in that order.  It just bugs me a little to hear proponents of dd/mm/yy claim that the US is somehow going its own separate way just to be contrary to Enlightened Europe, when in fact the US is just keeping what has always existed and what is the natural spoken order.

As ridiculous as this may sound, using the "store of value" definition, Bitcoin *is money* in a way that fiat currencies no longer are (but could be).  "Money" is a way to transact business without barter, and also a way to store the value of past labor for future consumption without that value declining.  The supply of Bitcoin expands very slowly and at a fixed schedule, which *should* perform this function.  Such a scheme is far superior to being created at the arbitrary whim of a politician.  
The problem, though, is that the supply of Bitcoin is expanding slowly (as if interest in it were static) and the desire to own Bitcoin among the world's population is expanding very rapidly, so naturally the value of Bitcoin is flying upward, and 1 BTC buys you ten times what it did just a year ago -- which is making Bitcoin swing all the way to the "you want to hold this, and not spend it" side.
Some people are excited about the technology because they think it will change the world for the better; others want to store value because fiat currencies no longer do this; now we have still others who see something exploding in value and just want to profit off it.  All these factors are making Bitcoin *less* like **money** (which, remember, is a *store of value* and not something to speculate with) and more like a stock or other speculative asset.
Great if you hold bitcoin, but it actually means that bitcoin is not the incorruptible, fixed-value substitute for fiat that society is still in need of.  It should still be better than what politicians have turned our "money" into over the past 40 or so years.  If just one country would back its money with something (i. e. real "sound" money), anything with a somewhat-fixed value (gold, silver, oil, land...), the need to speculate in something like bitcoin would stop rising and it could make a better everyday currency -- an alternative form of sound money.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:27:06


Exactly.  The vast majority of the time in investing, dollar cost averaging is a way to hedge against risk.  In a market as crazy as this one, in which there is a huge run-up and then a massive crash, DCA is much worse than if you just put all your assets in on day one and never thought about it again.

Trivia from the math side of this rule of thumb: the actual number is 69.3, or, if you're not working with percentages, 0.693.  This is the natural log of 2 (that is, e^.693 = 2). 
If the value of something is C now, in T years it will be worth Ce^kT, where k is the interest rate.  
This is when things compound or decay continuously.  If you only pay out interest annually, the growth is slower (because the interest isn't generating more interest until the end of the year), which accounts for the difference between 72 and 69.3.
