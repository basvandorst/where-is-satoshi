It's an analogy to gold mining.

Maybe

Lol no. XD Trading bots don't hack anything. Trading bots just automate the trading on exchanges.

Yeah that's what i thought too, but it wouldn't be nearly as cool as a single interplanetary currency XD

Yea, but where is the Raspberry Pi in the background connected to? 
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:35:57
I had a similar problem, with my first node. It had something to do with the way I set up the network for the virtual machine. But idk if that's the case for you.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:03:56
Ok. Thank you for your advice :D
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:43:47
So i should just wait a little longer?
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:24:19
Yes. I cloned the git repo and compiled it directly on my ubuntu server.

I only know some people interested in crypto currencies, but unfortunately they are not very technical versed  XD.

O_O You are a german spy!

Of course. But you can't influence the price of Bitcoin directly. You can however influence the amount of BTC you own. And more BTC is always better, regardless of the price :)

Thanks :D

The verification process finally went through :D.
Although my account details state that i'm now level 3 verified ??? (There are only 2 verification levels)
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:48:35
Nah. Not yet :(
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:42:47
Nope. Nothing...
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:28:09
