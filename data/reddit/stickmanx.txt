everyone get a decoy ledger with some coins on it =D
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:30:08
i can watch this over and over again lol
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:14:43
that means btc must go higher now?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:21:06
maybe i can actually get some bitcoin, like a whole coin this time around =D
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:48:38
the store of value is where all the support is
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:01:12
the spread on that stuff is so wide, there's like no liquidity
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:23:46
those people usually have underlying agendas and will say whatever they need to say with a straight face
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:28:51
bank wires usually happen pretty fast on coinbase, like 1 or 2 business days, bank transfers took about 5-6 business days
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:30:32
you should definitely download your history for tax purposes
@_date: 2018-09-20 03:45:11
i wonder if they record statistics on which glyphs are used the most
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:58:14
i haven't had any real issues with them aside from when the market dips hard and you can't do anything on the coinbase app as everyone wants to buy, usually gdax is still running though
the bcash stuff was a bit out of the blue though
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:32:30
bitcoin is still king, you don't fork bcash or bgold, you fork bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:12:55
it always bounces back... and higher
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:33:20
you would have no record of how much it cost to purchase the crypto, basically saying you obtained it at $0? making your gain the entire amount, thus the entire amount is taxable, at least in the US?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:09:46
79% bitcoin 21% bcash, about the price of bcash lol (17000 * .21) = 3570
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:02:19
I thought the futures were all cash settled, meaning you don't get the option to actually buy the bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:07:51
i can't take anything seriously that is just a wall of text, learn to use paragraphs and organize your arguments
@_date: 2018-09-16 08:12:49
I agree, I would also spread out your buys over time (dollar cost average), like many others have said because the ups and downs won't feel like anything (if it's up, great you don't need to FOMO buy, if it's down, great you still have money to add more to your position)
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:16:19
all i know is i want more coins, the cheaper it is the more coins i can have
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:57:44
everyone knows all the estimated halvings to year 2100+, are they also priced in?
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:05:15
i guess it's not that regrettable lol, just wasted time doing taxes for it
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:40:37
on the same page as you
@_date: 2018-08-24 05:44:08
Needs some reference to the cost of power around the world
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:35:06
once i started dollar cost averaging, i have become unfazed by the movement, if it's down, i'll just buy some more
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:11:30
seriously, i regret selling some crypto at a profit, i did end up buying back in lower however most of those gains were used to pay taxes so it's pretty much a wash
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:49:36
if they have been buying the last 5 months, the low has only been around \~5700 or so, which isn't too far off from where we are now
@_date: 2019-10-17 04:00:29
That's a snapshot as of June, the data has not been updated since June. They seem to only update it every 6 months?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:35:04
i'm still trying to get myself just 1 bitcoin hahaha, this helps
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:53:51
The fact that they used the term "blockchain" says it all =D
@_date: 2019-02-18 06:24:46
How much is the fee?
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:04:34
it's funny, i've been more concerned about my stocks then bitcoin and i lost more value in bitcoin than stocks
@_date: 2019-01-26 08:18:49
power and influence
@_date: 2018-03-04 07:02:21
you should be able to download your transaction history and calculate the difference
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:29:29
if the price keeps going down =]
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:54:16
the more i see articles like this, the more i feel like i need to buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:30:03
at my current buy rate (it's not high), i can keep buying for multiple years
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:59:45
I agree, last time the bank screwed me over by expiring my reward points (my fault really lol), I decided to move a material amount of money out of a savings account and into a checking, assuming they won't be able to loan out as much or play with that amount anymore. Give me a cash transfer fee on a bank backed credit card, move more money into crpyto. Obviously all this money is ending up somewhere, but it's not in my bank account anymore.
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:02:56
i better buy some so the price can go back down so i can buy more
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:43:33
It's so boring, can we just bottom out already so I can load up
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:24:29
it could be like from 2013 to 2016, it didn't stick in the green dotted range, who knows
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:39:46
how much currency does anyone need day to day anyway, have a heap load of bitcoin, while you convert some to whatever is the currency for the day to day use, whether it's some other crypto or fiat money
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:40:24
lol, i checked pretty often, haven't seen it come back
i honestly kept checking for domestic shipping on the nano s and ultimately they increased the price and made free shipping, however the increase in price was the cost of shipping internationally, so i still haven't purchased one
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:24:33
once they start incorporating that money into their budget inflows and spending it like it's a consistent stream of revenue, they will keep up the practice to continue the status quo
