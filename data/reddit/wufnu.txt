I thought I'd seen a large wall yesterday when I watched a 700BTC one get eaten in like 20 seconds but this is considerably larger.  Impressive.  
edit: the 1000BTC sell wall lasted slightly longer than the 700BTC buy wall from yesterday... but not much.  Funny to think that, currently, the same amount of BTC it took to go from $10,990 to $11k is the same amount of BTC required to go from $11k to $12k.

That's not to say FUD is necessarily untrue, remember.  These folks didn't become masters of global finance by being weak and any attempt to persuade you to sell them your coins is going to be a convincing argument.

The same people that drove the price up the past couple of days.  Didn't you see the sell walls falls?  Those people weren't placing orders for hundreds of BTC out of altruism.  When it became apparent CME opening BTC futures wasn't going to repeat the spike of last time, they cashed out to exploit the optimism of everyone at that time and likely rebough the panic sellers at a lower price.

Two things, I think: 1) people really bought in prior to launch, expecting/hoping for a quick rise like when CBOE launched and 2) the whales that helped break the walls leading to the pre-CME-launch runup cashing out when it was obvious a sudden price increase wasn't coming.

That's a trust, not Bitcoin.  I know what you're saying and ETFs would be different.  
"GBTC resembles an exchange-traded fund in that it is passively managed and has been seeking to replicate bitcoin's movement. It's been around since May 2015 and is not listed on a major exchange, trading instead in the "pink sheets" or the over-the-counter market. The trust offers investors a rare chance to invest in digital currency without actually have to buy bitcoins.
[However, the failure to replicate the price the way, say, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF accurately tracks the metal, is a problem that became especially acute earlier this year. Grayscale sought in January to make the trust a full-fledged ETF and was restricted from creating new shares."](

Turn on the buy bot to encourage others to buy, helping to increase the price, then sell off once other people's enthusiasm dies down and drive the price low, taking those newbie traders BTC in the process.  It's very hard to time the market but it's much easier when you can influence the timing.

Edit: probably not what you were looking for, sorry.  There's a limit to the amount of money you can transfer to/from your bank account to your Coinbase accounts.  Is that what you mean?  I don't think there's a limit on buying/selling within Coinbase, as long as you have the cash/btc for it, but there is on transferring funds into/out of Coinbase.  Also, do not trade on Coinbase; use GDAX (same company, exchange with lower or zero fees and no price adjustments).

I've heard they are.  I did some calcs using Hashflare, as an example.  Buying 13.5 TH/s for 1 year would cost around $3750 (including maintenance fees) and earn you about $5600, profiting about $1850.  Running an Antminer S9 would result in a profit of about $4200 (accounting for estimated difficulty increases and including electricity, enclosure, ducting, etc. costs but excluding downtime).  
I don't think any of those companies run their own mining machines.  One reason they might act as a broker between miners and subscribers is the reduction of risk.  They get the majority of cash flows up front and if the price of the coins being mined tanks they aren't hurt.  Plus, they can run their business without having a physical location with associated overhead.  It seems like a good, low risk model.  The only risk I can see is if they run out of mining power thus making them unable to fulfill their contracts which I'm betting is in the ToS somewhere saying something they don't guarantee blah blah blah "you can't sue us if you don't get the full hash power you paid for".

Easily refuted: greed knows no bounds.  Very few will be "satisfied" with the current price (at any given time), much less a portion large enough to cause a cascading collapse by all becoming satisfied at the same time.  
The danger would be if a large portion of investors believed the price was going to plummet, causing them to lock in their profits by selling at the same time.  Even then, there would be many looking to buy at a discount lowering the price damage caused.  It would likely then recover over time, as it has in the past.  This isn't a danger to those that hold.

I've been wondering the same.  Looks like someone just put in a recurring buy every second at 163 Satoshis.  I don't know why.  Keen risk minimization technique haha 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:58:20
Maybe he is.  I can see miners working for expected returns rather than selling immediately, i.e. miners way of investing.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:59:16
Congrats! :D  I wanted to do the same but Coinbase is slow as molasses. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:16:03
What is the strategy?  Are they shorting, somehow?  With trading as slow as it is today, I'm not certain they would be able to re-buy the coins sold while acting as a price wall and even if they could whether it would result in greater profit than just letting the price rise naturally.

Increasing purchasing power passively is a huge draw for many.  I can't say I blame people for getting excited when something good is happening to them.  Excitement brings exposure which brings familiarity which leads to adoption.  
Maybe someday, when it's dollar 2.0, we can think about just how good we have it and reminisce about how we were into bitcoin before it was cool (BTC hipsters of the future... although we have them now, as well, apparently).  
Until that day, I'll be more focused on how I can best use it to increase the financial well being of myself and my family while hoping it meets its tech potential.  Use the tool you *have* and not the tool you *want* to have.

I remember when I first learned of Bitcoin in 2012, it was making national news (probably Reddit) and was a whopping $15-ish dollars at the time.  I thought, "man, I wish I'd have gotten in on this when it was realllly cheap".  
Then in 2014, I needed to buy some for... stuff.  It was like $400!  I thought, "man, I wish I'd have gotten in on this in 2012 when it was realllly cheap".  
May of this year the topic came up with a coworker and we were astounded to see it was over $1500!  "Man, I wish I'd have gotten in on this in 2014 when it was realllly cheap".  
Then a month-ish later, happened to check again and it was an astounding $2500!  "Man, I wish I'd have gotten in on this last month when it was realllly cheap".    
Then when we checked again a month or two later it was around $3500.  "Man, I wish I'd have gotten in on this a couple months ago when it was realllly cheap."  
Six weeks go buy and it's around $6500.  "MAN, I wish I'd have gotten in on this a month and a half ago when it was realllly cheap."  
It's a recurring theme, with me.  Always figure as soon as I buy in it will esplode.  I just bought today, will see.  Condolences if my bad luck ruins your retirement.  
update: sorry guys!

Does this mean antminers will be garbage after the fix, approximately 18 months from now?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:43:38
Is that why suddenly there are all of these large sell orders that just popped up out of nowhere?  How long was it down?
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:38:48
That was the plan.  I knew it would go down after I bought, I realized it was at a probable short-term peak, but it'll go back up and that valley is where I hope to buy some more once my weekly limit is up (Coinbase =/).
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:02:26
Multiple sell walls all day today.  They've been relentless.  It's like the crashening 2.0. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:52:28
Are you talking that big rally after it bottomed out the first time last night?  Apparently that was Bithumb going down.  I was watching the orders on gdax when it happened, suddenly the sale orders $20 under the mid market price and spamming $0.01 orders disappeared and the price started climbing.  When Githumb came back, it "corrected" and the BS started again. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:49:04
Last night when I went to sleep BTC was about the same price but BCH was considerably higher.  Previously, BTC and BCH were moving lock-step but in opposite directions.  My question now is, which coin did they go to or did they take their KRW and go home?  
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:13:37
I bought two today.  I saved $100 just in the time it took for me to switch currencies and pay (~30 minutes) due to BTC rising while BCH fell.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:44:17
I'm new to this and want to test my understanding so I'm going to say what I *think* it is and under Cunningham's law if I'm wrong someone will jump in quickly to correct.  
You have a base level that is based on actual value, e.g. value created by convenience and underlying tech.  Being able to transfer money cross-borders has a value, potential for anonymity, etc.  
Above this, you have the long term investors that create a pool of invested money that has a value of its own.  You'll spot these guys easily because they can't spell "hold".  The more money that's been used to buy BTC, the more invested people are in the currency and the larger the value it has, at least on paper.  
Above those guys, you have the day traders that try to buy low and sell high but do so at a reasonable speed.  They study up on trading crypto or switch over from trading stocks.  They really know what they're doing, even though most lose money and give up eventually.  
At the top you have speculators which for the most part are great money destroyers.  They chase the highs by buying in on hype, called FOMO which sounds dirty but isn't (I like to think of them FOMO-ing at the mouth), and then sell out of fear when things go the other way.  I was in this group because I'm new and dumb.  This speculative value, or expectation of future returns/losses, drives quick and large value fluctuations based upon heresay, speculation, emotion, and hype.  
Edit: damn, forgot the miners!  So the guys that mine verify transations and "create" bitcoin.  This follows normal supply/demand and is susceptible to the same manipulations as other markets (as recently shown).  
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:23:23
I was about to say they had more in stock as I'd just bought two but, damn, you're right.  All gone, already.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:00:55
That would explain why BTC price dropping but BCH still at relatively low levels; they're cashing out of BTC, as you mentioned.  Yesterday, when BTC had fallen to these levels, BCH was in the 2000s.  Now, it's still ~$1500.

Is there something weird with Githumb re: ordering?  Now that they're back up, we're back to people selling like $10-20 below the mid market price.

Last night there was a 500 BTC wall that would drop the price, let it fall, then lower their asking price to continue the momentum while preventing return.  We all have been seeing them on order books.  Another guy was complaining about a ~1000 BTC wall on another exchange.  It's been interesting.

Last time I was on GDAX, I'd looked at BCH/USD price to see how closely it was following BTC/USD.  Many hours later, I figured I'd check to see how BTC/USD was doing and the number on the chart said around $1200.  I 'bout shit muh pants.  It loaded the BCH/USD price since it was the last one I had open.  Doh!

The media attention of the past few months has attracted the big boys; people that already excel in a bloody, ultra-competitive market.  They didn't accumulate all that capital by being stupid or weak.  They want to own this market, too, and they probably will eventually.  They're going to get the majority of coins.  Not just from the weak hands but the strong ones, the smart ones, etc.  They're going to hang Joe Blow upside down and beat on the bottom of his boots until all the coins have emptied from his pockets.  Their effects will be terrifying and their arguments extremely convincing.  
That being said, I don't think they're what is driving the prices down.  We, John Q. Public, are.  Speculators are.  I mean, the big boys certainly help but more likely they just get the ball rolling in one direction or the other and we do the rest.

I'd say we're due for a recession, actually.  A small correction is nice but I expect more in the next couple of years. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:11:27
We're still up around 1.8% from this time yesterday on GDAX, no biggy.  1.8% a day ain't bad, 't all.  Still a bit fast, imo.  The price on GDAX went down so much with so few BTC being sold, just didn't have the buy order support necessary to hold price.  I assume it was the same on other exchanges.  Better to go slow, let buying orders build, and be stable.  
Up 2.5%, now.  Need to type faster.
