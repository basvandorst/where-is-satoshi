You are mistaken.  The terms at Amazon require arbitration which is at least $1500.00 to file and then the hourly fees.  So we are talking about, here, many thousands of dollars.  And the amount in losses is $5200 plus more for the cessation of seller account and inventory which is side effect.

Yes, even FinCen has a $1000 per day per person exemption.

These kind of statements do not consider that their were factors that are unlikely to occur again during those crashes.  There were failures of exchanges before MTGox like tradehill etc and then there was the willy bot that falsely raised prices, etc.
So these statements are not reflective of a true or mature marketplace.

The last line above " .... is not systemic ..., and it does NOT affect Shoppers or Merchants."  is patently  UNTRUE.  Talk to me, but I think you already know the below.  Use your perfect accounts to get back our perfect accounts if that statement is true.
I and a Doctor friend of mine, USA citizens, residing in USA both lost our Amazon accounts.  One, for sure, was for Prime usage with Purse.io and one because used Gift cards which were paid for with cash, matching serial numbers on receipt, and successfully redeemed by Amazon.
BE AWARE, if this happens to you Amazon keeps all the remaining funds and any seller items and commissions you may have a a seller and after 5 months, that "Department" will not communicate or resolve issue.  Both accounts were perfect accounts for about 10 years.  Amazon treats it like "civil forefeiture".
I like purse too, obviously, because I used them, however,THEY MAKE NO WARNINGS ABOUT THIS.  Keep in mind, Amazon has at any one time about 15 BILLION dollars in gift cards unredeemed and if the public knew what was going on at Amazon, they would not use gift cards which in effect is a  15 Billion dollar interest free loan from the public.
You can listen to a recent podcast on Letstalkbitcoin.com Bitcoin Epicenter show to get more details about the shady Gift card business and how innocent people are being hurt badly.

Correction, the Fincen exemption is $1000 per day, per person is not an MSB for currency exchanger.

No, to raise awareness that the Bitlicense and the California Bitcoin legislation prevents peer to peer bitcoin sales.  You can only use in commerce, which is the same as my headline.  That is the same as saying you cannot sell your gold or silver without a license.  Essentially, you would have to use a licensed exchange and pay a fee and have your transaction recorded.  Even FinCen has an exemption of $1000 per day per person.  Not so in California or New York.  They say something like "as a business", which is like the SEC is saying a security is anything they say it is (no real definition) and more restrictive than Federal government.
In fact, peer to peer should not require any kind of license.
How do miners sell their bitcoin to pay their electric bill without paying fees? How do I make a large payment in Bitcoin who wants to convert to cash without exchange fees and wait for days to get the funds into a bank.  What if I get a large sum of bitcoin and want to sell it off in smaller chunks.  Is that a business?  You see what I mean?

Look at note 19, less than 1000 dollars per person per day.  More detail at Fincen.  Looks legal to me, plus you mean I cannot sell my commodity as defined by IRS?

Take a look at the $1000 exemption which probably applies to currency exchanger (check definitions elsewhere in Fincen stuff), where not an msb as far as Feds concerned in this exemption.
Look at this argument for peer to peer transactions
Seems it should or could be legal, but the prosecutors just presume it is not, or, in other words, guilty until proven innocent.  Looks to me that this one will have to be argued with some intelligent caring judges.  Making peer to peer sales illegal, seems to me, has tremendous ramifications for many other circumstances.  For example, selling gold or silver bullion or currency coins.  I think to some extent, authorities rely on the fact that most sellers can not afford a fair, informed decision.  Justice comes highly compensated.  I got two quotes for two different law firms in this field which were $5000 retainer or $2500 retainer just to ask a question and basically an hour or two of their time was implied.
Those that say it is and those that say it is not are being very presumptuous in my opinion.  I believe it is, but I am not a lawyer or constitutional expert, but have read all that I can find.
Let me know what you learn.

Is this committee chairman (Matt Dababneh (D-Encino) really trying to protect the public or ignorantly thinking he found a feather for his hat?
If regulation worked for the public, maybe it would have some value. Regulation keeps the good away and brings in those who are well endowed or do not care. Likely this politician does not have a clue on how Bitcoin is self regulated and escrow protection thru multi sig. etc. Time for another petition?

Just as New York Crypto development was packing up for California the California bureaucrats decide they would like to show their ignorance as well under the excuse of "protecting the public" with all the the un intended consequences.  After all the banking regulations have been working so well, we surely need more.  No comment period and only two out of eight say no.  Banks must love this.

All these notices, negotiations, education of politicians is fine, but now after a year we see their mindset is stuck in a box at best, so in addition how about this.
The government seems to love sanctions so how about if the community sanctions places like NY and California with mathematics and software.  Block NY and CA Ip's and decline user verifications from those states and let the users know why.
The politicians will understand the public once the public vote wakes up.  Remember Libya and Egypt.  Use the power of the public, force not needed, other than the vote and notoriety.  Mold does not like the sunlight.  Even silicon valley might wake up to what is being done in the name of public protection.

I think you are correct about using Google talk number is a dumb idea if sms rather than Google authenticator.  However, how did he get by Coinbase which used Google authenticator and sms.  
Google maybe should advise against two factor sms.

Not a stupid question, maybe.  Without a very long explanation, yes and no as I have different numbers and also wondering how this might be a weakness, although, my computer is not available to others and I believe not compromised.
@_date: 2016-06-19 01:09:43
I agree and just changed to Google authenticator as I use elsewhere.  Hacker was able to get thru, however, google authenticator at Coinbase and then deleted account, so cannot check it. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 01:12:04
Never been to Phillipines, however, with google I was using sms 2factor which I now changed to google authenticator as with Coinbase.  In any case, he got thru both.

I love technology and BTC, however, while we wait for this technological strategy, I believe, we may lose the war and discourage new business plans, trying to battle strategies.  A compromise really seems appropriate.  What do you think? Segwit plus small increase adjustable blocks sounds quite reasonable to me in order to win the adoption war and assure survivability.

When paypal started selling these reload cards, they should not only have scanned the card, but also the Driver's License of the purchaser, then they would not have to be banning the consumer for Paypal's failure. 
Instead Paypal induces purchasing these  reload cards and then Paypal blames and bans the consumer for Paypal not being able to properly monitor the cash to meet our macro managing government regulations.  Thank the Almighty for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-04-29 03:03:26
No.  They may release funds in 45 days if no complaints, but they often use the 180 days as part of user agreement.  Also, you likely are banned from Paypal as far as the eye can see.

Right, but when is someone going to stand up to the Government.  The Coinbase investors could bear a little skirmish better than their customers if they really believe in Bitcoin.  2001 was an attack on our financial system also and is the Government reactionary controls helping or hurting the economy?  Google chokepoint and consider Banks guilty even if proven innocent mentality because of Government intervention, and then decide.  Our complacency may be the culprit

What is a "Customer Business"??? below is part of the 46 pages  A bone at the end.
Virtual Currency Business Activity means the conduct of any one of the following types of activities 
involving New York or a New York Resident:
 
(1) receiving Virtual Currency for Transmission or Transmitting Virtual Currency, except where the 
transaction is undertaken for non-financial purposes and does not involve the transfer of more than a nominal 
amount of Virtual Currency; 
(2) storing, holding, or maintaining custody or control of Virtual Currency on behalf of others;
 
(3) buying and selling Virtual Currency as a customer business; 
(4) performing Exchange Services as a customer business; or 
(5) controlling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency. 
The development and dissemination of software in and of itself does not constitute Virtual Currency Business 
Activity.

This is a good idea and here is why.  With publicly trading stock, this is done all the time, through forward splits, etc.  Why?  Well one reason is even though you get more or less stock for the same dollars invested, that price tends to go back to were it was.  This is how stock holders can get there investment  devalued and vice versa depending on how the split  happens.  The math is the same, but the perception is different.
