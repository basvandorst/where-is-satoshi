I didn't ask if it was known. Of course no one can know. I asked what is envisioned.
It is more than a little dodgey to say, "We know coffee won't fit," with absolute certainty, and then turn around with, "we have no expectation of what might fit."
You're saying, "we don't know what the market wants and the market is wrong," in the same breath.
And by the by, if a block is "full" relative to a limit, all demand above that limit is by definition obfuscated. Maybe you can get a sense from the mempool and average fees, but you have no idea what true demand might be. It's like throwing out people who "left the labor force" from unemployment statistics because they gave up looking for work and are thus not "unemployed."
@_date: 2016-04-10 22:50:44
Can you answer the question I asked?
@_date: 2016-04-10 21:04:58
The price of fees on the blockchain will be passed along to all features built on top of it. LN isn't free dude.
@_date: 2016-04-10 19:03:36
I don't care about LN. The price of LN is a derivative.
We can't keep walking around saying, "All the coffee in the world won't fit on-chain," and then have no idea what we're actually building the blockchain for at some baseline. There *has* to be a commodity baseline to trade upon the blockchain itself before moving to a derivative at volume.
Edit: We don't have to know what the baseline is now. But we also can't design without a vision.
@_date: 2016-04-10 19:06:57
What is small enough?
@_date: 2016-04-11 01:52:53
What? There is a blockchain even with no miners? That defies reality.
Miners are part of the market. They are the seller to the transaction buyer. 
@_date: 2016-04-10 18:57:31
Bitcoin is a product with a price like anything else. Pick a loaf of bread, barrel of oil. It doesn't matter. 
If you didn't know if tomorrow you could trade that item for the price you did today, how often would you use that product? It would have to be less than if the price was consistent.
@_date: 2016-04-10 22:42:37
I'm not talking about schools of thought. I'm talking about price, at the individual level. You are arguing that bitcoin behaves opposite to all known price functions.
@_date: 2016-04-10 17:11:19
Long term, regardless of the solution, all the coffee won't fit.
But what *is* the smallest tx denomination envisioned that will fit as its own tx on the blockchain? Is it a nice dinner? A plane ticket? A new car? A house? An inter-bank settlement?
@_date: 2016-04-10 21:31:07
It doesn't matter "how LN works." LN is a layer 2 solution. All layer 2 solutions will absorb costs from the layer 1 blockchain. That's basic math.
@_date: 2016-04-11 02:06:56


Then what the fuck is a transaction fee? Their product is the production and confirmation of the ledger known as the blockchain. They sell blockspace in that blockchain, and generate more capacity to acquire new customers to that blockchain with each reward.


If there is no one mining bitcoin, how is there a blockchain? You make absolutely no sense here.

@_date: 2016-04-12 16:29:51
It's not about the fees. It's about gaining new users. The blocksize limt is effectively the cap on usership. If a mere 10,000 people wanted to use bitcoin right this moment and buy something, they couldn't. They would be stepping all over each other, and a certain number would back out after their tx hangs for too long, not to use bitcoin again because their first experience was bullshit.
@_date: 2016-04-10 21:33:55
So it's safe to say you believe bitcoin should be wholesale-level money/settlement/savings, not "retail" money?
@_date: 2016-04-10 22:43:49

I am in the minority of this opinion probably, but securing the network is not the function of miners. Miners sell blockspace. Period. An individual miner is not securing the network on his own. 
Security is *an effect* of the size of the network. That the network is more or less secure is not the responsibility of an individual miner. They don't exist to "secure transactions." Immutable security is a function of the *aggregate* volume of miners and hash power relative to overall transaction volume.

Stability over time at these low price levels is not good IMO. People will start using it exclusively as an investment vehicle to do things like cover loans. You don't want that, because that means dumping.
Volatility is very good in the early days, and it still is early - it shakes off the risk averse accordingly and prevents them from duping themselves.
You don't get to $1m coin without Volatility all the way up the ladder.

I cannot think of a single instance of FDIC actually being invoked and proving its practical function. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 05:19:30
You don't understand circulation.
10 million coins mined does not mean 10 million in circulation.
If 10 million are mined, but 1 million are being held as savings for an unknown length of time, there are only 9 million being circulated in the economy. That 9 million is worth more than if an additional 1 million were on the market.
If you are selling bananas, and your inventory is 100 bananas, if I sell 100 more bananas unto the market that I've been withholding for years, your original 100 bananas that were "in circulation" have been devalued that there are now 2x in circulation.
@_date: 2015-12-27 07:17:18
It is a false assumption that all savers of bitcoin are going to cash out into fiat. If that were true, then bitcoin has already failed and will hit 0.
It is also false that consumption grows the economy. Bitcoin has gone from valueless to $6 billion, and consumption has been negligible, literally 1.5 transactions per second. And with the current blocksize limit, mass consumption is mathematically impossible. Yet people hold bitcoin, and a million dollars in bitcoin are mined/fee'd per day.
And I don't know where your "help the economy" stuff comes from. No individual actor can "help the economy." That doesn't even make sense. They act in self interest. The aggregation of self interest called saving happens to increase the value (and thereby likely expenditure) for the remaining economy.

Mike, I am not a developer, but I would also like the option to have a client with no limit at all similar to XT fork.
Is it possible to have two hard fork experiments simultaneously and see who goes no limit? I feel like if we're doing an XT 20mb, it makes more sense to go limitless right now than test 20mb. And I think seeing how people respond to no limit is more important as it's a fundamental shift in psychology--the paradigm of people applying solutions must scale (in the long run), not just the tech, right?

Money doesn't exist in a vacuum of supply without demand. You can use the word inflate as a word without regard to the economy and yes, the number of item X has inflated quantitatively. That means didly squat. In the context of an economy, inflation or deflation is by definition subject to supply and demand. If 25 Bitcoin were just mined, but acceleration of demand outstrips that velocity of inflation, then in practical terms the commodity is still deflating because there is LESS of it compared to the demand.
The price increasing is the market saying it is scare. That there is more of it in the universe without regard to utility is a pointless observation.

I would argue that Mt. Gox was the vaccine against future, more systemic potential Goxings. The risk-takers and first movers lost money so the late adopters won't. And regulation does not stop Goxes from happening. It didn't stop Too Big to Fail, it didn't stop Madoff, it didn't stop the scam that is Social Security. And those events are orders of magnitude more cataclysmic than Gox--and created entirely by effect of government activity.
EDIT: I completely empathize with the experience of fraud that was Gox. And it is that empathy that has already lead to innovative market solutions in Bitcoin such as the proofs of solvency, the third party audits, the security checks by competitors, and more. Consumer concern by early adopters has birthed solutions rendering regulation redundant and at worst cumbersome.

Great post, but as a few others mentioned: $6B market cap is not even close to the valuation. The majority of bitcoin are not for sale, and will never be for sale, at that price. Supply and demand will REQUIRE the market cap to hit many billions of dollars if all of Wall Street wants to play how they're used to playing.
Anecdote: If I had two BTC and someone offered me $1,200 for each, I wouldn't even sell one of them. Even $3,000 market price, I wouldn't sell. There are hundreds of thousands in the same boat. It would take a price of $10,000+ for me to even think about selling fractions of my coin into fiat.
But that's the kicker: if it's at $10,000 then chances are the economy is already reaching a state wherein I could live without converting to fiat in many expenditures.
If the price is $10k, my true sell price is now orders of magnitude higher *because that many more vendors or individuals value their goods in Bitcoin* and I use them.

I'm saying, until the total market cap of Bitcoin is much higher, you'd actually require an irrationally high amount of capital from the ecosystem for a globally negligible endeavor vis a vis all other Bitcoin participants on Earth. So, Bitcoin needs to be worth much more, like $10,000-$100,000 per 1m Satoshis in order for the incentives to align for very targeted, structurally limited demography products to exist.
If you're a bitcoin VC or angel choose: a car dealership for a hyper-specific locale, or a new platform for enabling wealth transmission, or global communication, or crowdfunding? What is going to increase my wealth and the ecosystem's prospects at large more effectively when market cap is only $~8 billion?
I'm not saying you shouldn't utilize Bitcoin in this endeavor--totally adopt it! But I think - and this is all my opinion - it would be a better strategy to speculate on future price by YOU personally buying and holding NOW, to facilitate this start up and raise more capital a year from now rather than seek 100% capital in Bitcoin when its only in the $500s.
Make any sense?

**TL;DR:** Financial Times is familiar with sidechains, ethereum, and lots of 2.0 technology and has a decent grasp on its implications.
Is the world ready for Bitcoin 2.0 when it is still struggling to get to grips with the 1.0 version?
With the inevitability of the tech industry’s restless hype cycle, a new set of grand claims is being made for the potential uses of the technology that lies behind the controversial cyber-currency.
Bitcoin 2.0 is the term being given to the use of the infrastructure to handle a much wider range of digital transactions. This has been a dream of the Bitcoin faithful for some time; now, the technology is showing signs of evolving to support the ambitions.
The hopes rest on the adaptability of the blockchain, the distributed, public ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. This is one of the main innovations that have fed hopes that the ideas behind the digital currency make it more than just a haven for speculators, drug dealers and crypto-anarchists.
Essentially, the blockchain provides a way to transfer value between two people online without the need for any central authority to validate the transaction. When a bitcoin is bought and sold, both parties can be certain the digital bits have been transferred and can’t be copied or replicated elsewhere.
Bringing that kind of certainty to peer-to-peer activities in a distributed digital marketplace is quite a feat. Imagine what it could do to buying and selling tokens that represent other assets, such as shares or houses. The potential uses are limited only by the imagination — and the tech entrepreneurs being drawn to Bitcoin have plenty of that.
Rather than representing just digital assets, for instance, entries in the blockchain could represent “virtual” keys that could be used to claim ownership of physical assets, such as cars, or to verify identity. From passports to wills to patents, the theoretical uses seem limitless.
Reality, however, has been slow to catch up. Bobby Goodlatte, an angel investor in Silicon Valley who has backed two Bitcoin companies, sums up the current state of the art: “It’s really early, and a lot of stuff has been over-promised.”
Adam Shapiro, of Promontory Financial Group, adds that separating the blockchain from its Bitcoin roots will not be simple. “It’s become fashionable for people to talk about being a fan of the blockchain and not of Bitcoin,” he says, but because they involve a transfer of value, all the potential uses are Bitcoin-like to some degree and so “at least a little bit financial services”.
From registrars to escrow agents — the world would never be the same again
The blockchain was not developed with other digital assets or “smart contracts” in mind and building on top of it causes other problems, says Adam Back, a British developer who came up with a key piece of the Bitcoin infrastructure. “It’s a little bit of a hack, really,” he says of attempts to adapt the technology.
One response has been the creation of alternative blockchains. One of the most ambitious projects, Ethereum, hopes to launch a network soon for contracts based on its own unit of currency, known as ether. But ideas like this involve starting afresh, making them all-or-nothing bets that don’t draw on the headway already made by Bitcoin.
The latest buzz to spread through the cyber currency world involves “sidechains”, or ledgers designed with specific purposes in mind — a market for trading equities, for instance — that are still “pegged” to Bitcoin, rather than requiring the creation of an entirely new currency. If it works, this would keep the network effects of being part of the Bitcoin world while freeing developers to come up with new models for cyber-transactions.
Blockstream, the company that Mr Back and a handful of other prominent Bitcoin developers have set up to create this infrastructure, raised more than $20m last month from luminaries such as Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Eric Schmidt of Google. That is a colossal amount for an initial seed round of financing, and a sign of the high hopes.
In the longer term, says Mr Back, shares or other forms of property could be issued directly through a sidechain, as well as being bought and sold that way. For all the intermediaries involved in those markets — from the registrars to the brokers and escrow agents — the world would never be the same again.
The potent technology of Bitcoin has always made it a good place for dreamers, and version 2.0 raises even more disruptive possibilities than its predecessor. The implications for a wide range of online interactions are intriguing — just as long as it can survive the inevitable hype.

It's not an argument, you're right; it is a definition without euphemism.
I'm the one stealing? What does that even mean? Reality IS taxation is theft. That is the technical definition:
tax (n): a **compulsory** contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers' income and business profits or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions.
compulsory (adj): involving or **exercising compulsion; coercive; obligatory;** required by law.

I'm not saying it'd change--I just think the fact that the individual bearing the tax isn't the one writing the check despite it being self-reported is important to note. This is way more difficult with Bitcoin.
The govt isn't going to take Bitcoin. So, now the burden will be even more of a compliance issue. If I pay 100% employees in Bitcoin, it's as if all business instantly became cash only. It will just make enforcement damn near impossible--I suspect they'll shift the tax burden HARD to AML/KYC sections for compliars like money transmitters Coinbase/Circle and get really intrusive.

Being free from monopoly, Bitcoin is subject to a HUGE number of inputs. So, just thinking relative to USD excludes the larger global user base where USD isn't used the same either: China, Argentina, Europe, Canada.
Bitcoin aggregate supply is inflationary at a decreasing rate. But its supply relative to the entire globe is constantly deflating in countless economic microclimates as the good word spreads, so to speak.

But the government is not a market participant. The incentive to sell above market value does not arise in the same way it would in a true free market situation.

It is deflationary in terms of supply and in market price.
It has always been deflationary relative to the price of goods. Something doesn't "inflate" because more gets created alone. Inflation and deflation are RELATIVE to everything else.
Bitcoin's supply relative to demand is constantly shrinking in spite of future mining--of which we know the exact supply.

It's an interesting trailer, but I don't think it does its job that well -- insofar as I'm not sure I know what this movie is about. Is Andreas a primary character? Narrator? Is this about Bitcoin or about the "larger trends" Andreas refers to that have ultimately manifested as Bitcoin?
I work in the movie business - if this is your first go around, I'd love to give any feedback I can!

This is a very good thing. That would indicate a price discovery of the sustainable era of Bitcoin arriving sooner and with greater market certainty (i.e. the future market is prepared better than expected by virtue of its aggressive pursuit of Bitcoin).

@_date: 2014-08-15 20:22:00
I think the problem at the moment can be summarized thusly:
1) Unless your business is systemically disruptive to your particular sector and takes significant advantage of Bitcoin, you are unlikely to see Bitcoin as equity for you.
2) The price and total market cap of Bitcoin cannot yet withstand businesses such as yours. In order to penetrate into mainstream B2B and equity, the market cap will probably need to rise into the tens of billions first, likely hundreds of billions. UNLESS you are very centrally disrupting bedrock markets more critical to these developmental years of Bitcoin's life.
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:43:09
It is not a right. Developers, miners and exchanges work hard to meet your demands as a user/holder of Bitcoin.
You have the right to not have you assets and personhood violated against your will. Perhaps you acquired bitcoin by respecting such a right. But Bitcoin is not a right.

If I made a large purchase with Bitcoin but the purchase was at a loss, how might I record that? Is it worth the time?
For example: If I have some portion of coins that I purchased at 400, another portion at 360, but I spent 1000 total (70% from the 400 and 30% from the 360) on an item when px hit 330, how do I even begin to figure this out?

Bitcoin being an anarchic, decentralized currency, we can vehemently and morally disagree with this move. But we don't have to comply with shit if we don't want to. We can actually protect ourselves and property by simply refraining from participating with this part of the ecosystem. For the rest of us, this will drive up the value without harming us directly because we're free to abstain. For the first time in maybe all history. We are FREE to abstain from violent assholes attempting to squelch our personhood.
This is beautiful. We should want this as peaceful people for the sake of science: we will have a real-world, apples to apples comparison of what works and what doesn't. We know the answer, but now we'll have evidence to back up our reason. Demonstrably prove our thesis that nonaggression and peace = economic prosperity, happiness, etc.

There are many elements of the industry Bitcoin can disrupt - a lot of it within the industry itself and not even the B2C you're describing.
I think the ultimate would be micro transactions on a streaming service like Netflix. Let's say I'm a registered Netflix user but I don't want to pay the monthly fee because I don't use all that content. Maybe I'll only get $4 worth of content - so I just rent for each event, $0.25 - 0.50 at viewing or something in BTC, Six hours access. Instant, impulse by for low cost. Day rentals are more, etc.

Okay, and this is step one I suppose. So now let's say I'm this guy (the recipient of the coin from me).
If he NEVER touches cash at any point with his coin, only the next good or service he uses with it, what is HIS realized gain?
He can never pay income tax on Bitcoin if the coin was taxed and taxed again upon (a) the capital gain paid by the payer and (b) the capital gain that payee will pay in the future when he uses the coin.
I guess he could get taxed, but that is literally a triple dip on a single coin.

"Thus, all in all, the total number of currency units that will ever exist stands at 2,100,000,000,000,000: 2.1 quadrillion, or about 250.899. In choosing this figure, Satoshi was much luckier, or wiser, than most people realize. First of all, the number is considerably less than 264 – 1, the largest integer that can be stored in a standard integer on a computer – go above that, and the integers wrap around to zero like an odometer.
Second, however, there is another, lower threshold that the total satoshi count manages to fall just below: the largest possible integer that can be exactly represented in floating point format."

Take a pay cut. I mean this with all sincerity. I'm not blaming you for anything--but your income is, by definition, economically an expense for the rest of us without government-dependent income.
Footnote: if the government pays engineers artificially higher than the private sector, which they do, it siphons potential engineer jobs for the masses in the private sector who build the toys you buy, and also distorts the market by creating excess engineers looking for that gov't salary.
And in spite of that, I'd still take where I am over the knowledge that I am taking a cushy gig at the expense of my fellow human beings, against their will.

In the US, gov't jobs across the board make more than the private sector. Government-contracted jobs make even more. It's a huge burden on productivity.

Sorry, but no one is forcing a person to run a node, to update to a different version, etc. There is no force involved, whatsoever.
And even if a node is not a miner, it is still arguable that they get "paid," by maintaining the integrity of their holdings which also grow in value as others' utility of the blockchain grows in value.
By providing the service of confirming trading cards on the blockchain, or a title of ownership to anything, their own holdings increase in value because the other participants have to necessarily save Bitcoins themselves.

In the US, people would freak if it happened on a sweeping basis and not isolated incidents, so they instead just use quantitative easing to take your money indirectly. Which could be argued is worse than seizure outright since it devalues everything you own.
The analogy reflects that you fundamental do not own your assets/yourself if it can be legally taken; but you would not produce enough money to be taxed (e.g. the farmer taking the cattle's milk analogy and smaller stalls yield unproductive cattle) if you knew it was not "yours."

I don't see where you're getting ideas like needing to meet up and collude between miners to come to a decision about what is right, or this idea of voting ahead of moving to market.
BU removes this entirely. All you have to do now is say to yourself:
*-What is my bandwidth capacity?*
*-What is my propagation capacity? Am I limited by an external factor like TGF in China?*
*-What is my hash power?*
*-Given these, what is the best way for me to optimize this relative to my orphan rate and remain competitive, and what is my upper bound?*
**==my optimal max blocksize capacity to mine/propagate. Input that in BU GUI.**
Each miner and node will have a slightly different answer at a particular window of time: 3mb, 3.2mb, 2.9mb, 4mb, 2.8mb, 3.4mb
From that, a natural limit emerges in the market (this is your consensus) constrained by the aggregate variance in technical restrictions upon each participant.

In BU, the capacity of the network is actually determined by the available capacity supplied by the market.
For example, if the "sweet spot" is actually a 6.5Mb blocksize limit for March to July 2017, but then closer to 7Mb the rest of the year, the only way that level of precision is possible is with BU.

@_date: 2016-01-08 21:45:20
BU uses a soft limit - which miners and nodes already have the power to do.
Nodes and miners already have the capacity to set their own limits. Below any protocol level limit. The problem is that what if the protocol-enforced limit is lower than the actual peak capacity? What if on a Friday release of a huge movie, or in a holiday shopping bonanza, the miners blocksize need to spike up to 20Mb, but there is a protocol-enforced limit for one reason or another at 17Mb? Or what if a new layer (say, Lightning Network or a new stock market) will take up a new 2Mb?
All BU does is make this GUI configurable instead of a coding exercise. The market can converge on an emergent consensus more easily, and treats blockspace as the scare commodity that it is.
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:52:23

Isn't transaction volume limited by the increase in off-blockchain tx? (Rather, off chain will always and forever be an easy solution no matter scaling)
Won't bigger/fuller blocks reflect higher velocity and increased adoption, thereby price, therefore incentive to run full nodes (to maintain wealth integrity)?
Won't an increase in blocksize *massively* increase the incentive to have LN and sidechains solve scalability and tx volume at an even larger scale?
I have little technical knowledge. But this is my abstract skepticism. Thanks for everything you do, theymos.
EDIT: As a user, I am in favor of dynamic scale cap as compromise or more franky no cap at all as it forces the optimal solutions to max scale to see the light of day.

Sorry I did not spell out my logic re: price, but I am suggesting the number of participants  (miners, nodes, etc) in aggregate is heavily incentived to increase if the market is clearly bigger ($10,000 means a lot of things $1,000 couldn't, and $100,000 more still). That is the opposite of centralization, no? Even if margins are going down for miners, net income is still increasing as would net participants (e.g. mining and non-mining nodes).
I just don't find how bitcoin could flip from decentralization pressure to centralization pressure, at some undetermined arbitrary volume, counter to its entire previous growth patterns thus far and breaking all its established principles.

What about communication with exchanges? Since they're the wholesalers purchasing from miners--perhaps a truer estimate of the demand curve--wouldn't it be prudent to realize their incentive to buy from sustainable, future-proof and scaled miners?
An exchange saying, "I won't purchase your non-BIP101 coin after this date," is probably more leverage than pitching from a dev to a miner.

The centralization argument must assume the price of Bitcoin never increases substantially (which means not acquiring new users and use cases--in which case bitcoin is a failure anyway by many measures) and there is never an increased incentive to maintain mining anyway. The entire cover-the-electric bill argument is moot if they're simultaneously maintaining an ever-larger network with ever-larger (in fiat) rewards. The increased demand for bitcoin will decrease the operational expense of electricity by proxy.
If bitcoin is $10,000 the incentive to be a miner is necessarily orders of magnitude greater once again. I genuinely don't understand this centralization argument because it has to assume bitcoin remains relatively  stagnant in price or stop growing.

Miners are paid to secure the blockchain. You stated their function yourself, and yet in the same sentence then said miners are paid for a reason other than their function. Which is it?


By this logic, having 100000 miners secure a blockchain that only has a $10m market cap, and thereby orders of magnitude lower mining difficulty and security is preferable to 1000 miners at $1b market cap and necessarily more secure/higher difficulty.
I know which one I'd want to have a stake in.


This cannot be centrally engineered. Having a blocksize limit does not necessarily encourage mining, yet that is essentially your argument. No one profitably mines from their home as it stands, so ensuring a suburban household can mine is utterly pointless because it already doesn't happen at 700kb blocks.
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:53:22
You said, if X people decide "to take" your house and car, which is theft--then the gun is semantics. There is force, "gun" or otherwise.
There is no theft involved when you upgrade software, you do not lose bitcoin by upgrading or switching your implementation--the blockchain you are on does not magically disappear. It is utterly disingenuous to say wealth or property is being stolen in event of a hard fork. It is also empirically false.
You are putting a hard fork of open source software used by millions on the same moral ground as rape and theft. Stop fucking doing that.
@_date: 2015-11-09 23:07:54
You bid for your spot in the next block with your transaction fee. The blockspace is provided by the network of miners, who are also bidding/betting by virtue of solving blocks at a certain size relative to network capacity, average block sizes, etc.

Spam falls under moderation exclusively, given that it is by definition a moderators discretion that determines spam on any given forum.
Sure, spam meets the criteria of "doesn't contribute" in most instances, but "doesn't contribute" is not always "spam." In either case, these are all definitions up to a mod.
A person will only downvote if they fundamentally don't like a post for some reason. It cannot be considered a moderative action for a general user to "downvote as spam." There isn't more than one genre of downvote as a user.
A downvote is a downvote indistinguishable from all other downvotes, motivation be damned.
EDIT: I think I'm splitting hairs, but basically a user by the act of downvote, to me you cannot say they downvoted because they were motivated to suppress "spam." They downvote because they don't like it, and I don't see how that will ever not be true. Whether a user thought it was "spam" or not is impossible to determine.

Even if an item has 100% consensus in however this process plays out, there is no possible way to know it is 100% or 90% or 80%. You're asking *all* market participants to answer the question, "Will you promise to buy this car?" before they buy it. Even if 90% of people made that promise, it means jack until they *buy* it.
What if 30% of those market participants buy it and the car breaks and there's a recall? What if XT car breaks before hitting 75% market penetration? Then they actually saved the market a lot of time by deploying and failing. 
The market is the media of consensus, ultimately. You cannot truly achieve some notion of pre-market market penetration.

People act as individuals responding to their own incentives, not some hive mind that all simultaneously turns on 1500 nodes. If bitcoin Core nodes had been under DDOS in 2010, you can guarantee they never would have hit 6000 if it was sustained.

There are a mutiple more number of miners than pools. It is erroneous to act as if 1 pool = 1 person in control.

But I'm saying, the effect is the same: if someone wants to kill bitcoin at 1MB, it is more likely than at 20MB, as it is cheaper, and yet it hasn't happened. Why is there an assumption it will happen if the limit is raised?
EDIT: And, it would be preferable to raise the limit for this very reason--an attack is more likely to run out of money if block limits are higher. Short term pain, long term gain. Rather than consistent short term irritation. An entire attack is more likely to get sucked into a single block (1 10mb block in 10 minutes avg) instead of 100 minutes (10 1mb blocks 10 min avg).
Miners are unlikely to attack because of orphan risk and other miners lowering their soft limit.

But what if the nodes manually enforced their own block size limits? So if there are 99,000 other nodes despite that 1% hashing power single node or block of nodes, would a majority of nodes probably have their own limits in place?
Like 2% of nodes might accept anything, but the other 98% would probably have anything from 1mb to 30mb limits. No?
I'm not an expert on the technical details, but I just don't see how the market wouldn't correct for such an obviously undesirable thing as 1tb shit blocks from a powerful bad actor--quantity of nodes would overpower "quality" of hashing power in this case.

What does this even mean? And why is it important?
@_date: 2015-11-10 00:13:02
I know this. And the reason people operate nodes ultimately is to ensure the integrity of their wealth by holding and relaying the ledger. That in and of itself is the most massive financial incentive known to man: don't lose my existing wealth, which happens to be connected through the blockchain to others' wealth.

Mining isn't a charity operation--ensuring the lowest common denominator can "compete" is to handicap the network's capacity to scale, rendering mining unattractive to scale/invest/upgrade.

What does bubble mean? The market consistently settles at a new price as velocity, utility and demand increase. And if Bitcoin is to grow into its eventual destiny, then none of these spikes are bubbles by definition. Either it will go to zero, or meet its utility threshold that's literally hardwired into the network. There is no middle ground, bubble, etc. Other media of exchange are simply decreasingly useful relative to BTC functionality.

Yes, and unfortunately I just did that, and now what I thought would happen, happened. I reset to erase that, and I'm somehow down a Bitcoin. My transaction history with the wallet now doesn't even match the balance on my screen by a full BTC somehow. I'm so confused.

I guess I just assumed the change though was always relative to your entire wallet, not part of it. That's what confuses me, the lack of accounting for other deposits into the wallet when spending/receiving change.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:08:33
I'm not sure to which agreements you're referring. I've certainly never signed any contractual agreements with government as a citizen.
In any event, contracts are mostly enforced in the market. Government has virtually no input on the vast majority of arbitration for the very reason they are bad at it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:21:44
But this "bubble" as you see it cannot be compared to previous bubbles in their scope. Most bubbles you reference are in a particular regulatory (e.g. territorial) frame of reference. The majority of the BitCoin market is not in the United States. The price reflected in US dollars is just that: the international value as seen in our local currency. Also, it's not a stock, finite material good or a centralized currency. It literally has zero historical comparison to any "bubble" as an asset class.
There is virtually no reason for it to "crash" in any significant manner, because it's still necessarily low in real value compared to its future functionality, velocity, userbase and trade volume. It could crash back to to $250 or $300, but that won't be seen as an actual "crash" because in the future $500 has to be considered low. Even $800 has to be low if BitCoin is to fulfill its destiny as an international currency.

I will be in my third year working at Filmmaker Lodge on Main St. Great you mention this, I actually emailed No Name Saloon telling them I'd love to spend Bitcoin there this year--haven't heard back yet.
Any help you need, let me know! If you book the event, the two people to definitely tip celeb-wise would be Donald Glover (Childish Gambino) and Ashton. The latter had JOBS premiere there 2012 or 2013 if I recall. And both are into Bitcoin as I'm sure you've seen.
Having Ashton or Donald meet someone like Jeffrey Tucker would be fucking insane.

The difference is too high to be transaction fees, it's like a 4BTC difference between the input/output number and the actual balance of the address.

Is the ID in MultiBit found in that first string under Show Transactions Details &gt; Raw Transaction?
I never got a receipt after being prompted to spend with the MixedTees button, so I don't have anything from them. Just my info in MultiBit to look at.
EDIT: I suppose I can just reset to previous day, but I've already done other successful purchases today. I'm afraid to reset it...

Thank you, and I actually just resolved it!
In MultiBit, although some places advised resetting from the previous day, that messed it up. I had to re-reset from the beginning of time to get a proper balance.

The philosophy behind it, desire to spread its use and increase utility for future use (and thus its value). It is a revolution on par with the combustion engine and the internet in terms of how it will shape the future.
