If only they put some form of machine readable ... universal code ... on every product ...

Either way that is just credit sales. Debit fees are lower to nonexistent and same with checks and cash sales. It is a restaraunt so I would assume probably 60% cc sales so my estimate is way low.
Don't get me wrong they are still having to shell out $65k/year in card fees, and I'm sure they would rather put that in their pocket. Encouraging people to use the ATM (that is forcing a debit transaction) is not a real bad way to do it.
I guess my mistake is letting the OP talk me into believeing that they were doing this because they had some problem with the fee. I think the fact that they installed a fee-less ATM (they are eating the cost of this.) says they know exactly what they are doing.

That amount of fee puts gross sales at or above $200k/month or $2.4mm/yr. If they aren't making any money on that volume I am pretty sure the card fees are not their primary problem.

I cant understand how this is significant. If you take a slice of population, this sort of thing is way above most people's heads. Educating the jury about the facts of the trial and the context has been a problem long before the Internet entered into it.
Simply knowing enough to come to the comments of this post looking to discuss the issue is narrowing you into a very very small minority of the US population: tenths to hundredths of a percent, probably. We could make a jury out of the people here, but is it a fair jury?

They understand it fine. They are super smart. They know there are better ways to make money unfortunately. They do actually do a lot of open source stuff behind the scenes where it is to their advantage. The utter dominance of WebKit is a testament to this. LLVM is pretty dang important too.

They published pictures of the whole set and someone already manufactured them. Not that they couldn't have taken the locks apart and done it, but still they made it easier.  Not as easy as FDNY though making their fire key bitting code the NAME OF THE KEY

Nobody has mentioned that one of the reasons that this method of email encryption is not popular is because it's inconvenient as shit to use. It might be technically superior but when you can set up x.509 with about 3 clicks it doesn't really matter.
