From what I understand, ASICBOOST reduces power consumption by 20%. Are the energy savings that significant compared to skipping 100,000 USD worth of bitcoins every day?

Correct, but the driving force behind these aggressive short-term price spikes isn't steady organic growth looking to hold Bitcoin long-term, it's new money entering the cryptosphere trying to make a quick and dirty profit, thinking they can cash out with a nice chunk profit in a month or so.
When the growth starts stalling (which it will, we're still quite a ways to go for majority adoption), all those investors get hit by the FUD and start leaving in droves, because their precious fiat is all that matters to them.

If another coin takes the role of processing every-day transactions, becoming widespread to the point that most people use it, I don't see what's the motivation for using a separate currency like Bitcoin as a store of wealth.
I see the comparison to gold all the time, but the only thing Bitcoin has in common with gold is that it's a finite resource that's prone to speculation. And unlike gold, Bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value in industrial and cosmetic applications. So what would keep it relevant in a world where another currency that does more has the majority?
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:10:20
Sounds about right. This is starting to look like late 2013, where Bitcoin went up 5x in one month, then crashed into a 2-year-long bear market.

From what I understand, they don't want it because it'll set a precedent. If the block size is raised to 2MB and alleviates transaction bottlenecks (which it would), then the concern is that next time fees start getting high, people would ask "why not just raise it again?". Core devs don't want to go down this path at all, they want side-chains to be the exclusive method Bitcoin relies on for scaling.
On one hand, off-chain scaling makes sense: we'll never see VISA-level transaction volumes with on-chain scaling alone, the blockchain size would grow prohibitively large well before then. On the other hand, there's no reason we can't have both off-chain scaling *AND* modest on-chain scaling that keeps up with consumer hardware.

I guess, but if items still have to be scanned on their way out, why not just do the checkout there, preventing thieves from stealing already-purchased items from other peoples' carts?

Yeah, I did the math and they're taking around 5% of your funds as transaction fee, at least for BCH-&gt;BTC trades. Exchanges take around 0.25% at most, as far as I know.
Even considering the convenience factor, that difference sounds ridiculous to me. I suppose it's worth the price for people who can't get a verified account on an exchange.

Ethereum has never gone up anywhere *near* 30x within a 1-month timeframe from what I can see in the graph, so not sure what you're referring to. 
Same for Ripple, the highest increase I can find in the space of 1 month was 10x.

As a fully decentralized system, the blockchain doesn't care about laws. If you control your keys, you can do as you like with your Bitcoins. 
However, that doesn't mean entities won't blacklist certain bitcoins (especially ones used for criminal purposes) then track their movements on the blockchain, which can mean bad news for you if you end up with those on your wallet. There's already some precedent for this, with exchanges refusing to accept 'tainted' Bitcoin. Not sure if Bitcoin will ever have a fix for that as it requires quite extreme changes to the protocol, but there are altcoins with a focus on privacy and enforcing fungibility, such as Monero.

Bitcoin is in a really good position right now. Even though it's not technically the best cryptocurrency for quick/cheap/easy transactions, it's the most widely known and supported one. We can either continue working on expanding that beachhead into widespread adoption, or we can relegate Bitcoin into just a store of value, at which point an altcoin will happily fill the cash niche. 
Except it won't stop there. Once everyone and their mother is using the altcoin as the new cash system, and the price has rock-solid stability as a result, people will start asking themselves if there's any need for using a separate currency like Bitcoin as a store of value, when the altcoin does that job just as well.
Moral of the story: Do spend your Bitcoins whenever you have the opportunity to! Widespread adoption is the only way we'll ever get to the moon, and adoption starts with consumer demand. And if you don't like the idea of lowering your supply of Bitcoin (I don't blame you!), the solution is easy: whenever you buy something with Bitcoin, convert some of your fiat into BTC to give you back the same amount you spent. It's effectively the same as buying things with fiat, but you're encouraging businesses to support it.

You're right, they had their own reasons. Romans valued it because it doesn't tarnish, and has an uncommon (and arguably pretty) color for a metal. This led to its use in jewelry and other adornments, but its relative rarity made it so only the wealthy could afford it.
This isn't nearly as applicable in modern day. The demand for gold in jewelry has been steadily declining for several decades (understandably; technological advances help prevent tarnish in all manner of metals), and if it weren't for industrial and scientific applications creating a new source of demand for it, gold would be eventually heading into a situation of "it's valuable because... the central banks say so?". 
At that point, gold finds itself in basically the same place as fiat currencies, where we have only the word of the government backing up its value. Bitcoin's premise was to move away from this system, so having Bitcoin reduced to nothing more than a store of wealth would be the definition of irony. For Bitcoin to remain in use long-term, it'll need to establish for itself at least some niche use as a currency, so it won't become obsolete as more advanced implementations of cryptocurrency vie for adoption.

Exactly four years ago the price was around $95. It has increased 35 times, not 1000 times.
The "double every 18 months" estimate isn't fully accurate either, but it would have predicted that the price would be 13 times higher now, which is a lot closer to 35 than 1000.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:27:54
Smart choice. It has double the coin!

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I don't think it could actually work that way. The store would know which items are being bought, but not who's buying them, so they'd still need to tie a transaction to a customer to prevent thieves from impersonating legitimate customers. (example: thief sees customer QR-scanning expensive item, grabs another unit of said item, then walks out the door pretending to be the customer that just did the transaction)
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:39:50
Not that safe, no. For two reasons:
1. The current price is quite high. Not as high as Bitcoin's ever been, but high enough that it's gonna look good for investing when you look at past values. If the price had been crashing, the site would paint a very different picture.
1. Pretty sure the site is finding the lowest price point for the day you selected, in order to make the profit calculations. If you were to buy, you wouldn't be able to pinpoint the optimal time to buy with that much accuracy.
With that said, the long-term trend has always been one of growth, so as long as you're willing to wait long enough, you'll eventually make profit even if you bought on a high.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:40:55


That's only true if you're willing to lower your Bitcoin holdings. And if you're serious about Bitcoin, you wouldn't do that.
Take the following example: There's a car for sale, which you can buy for 10 BTC or $32,000 (1 BTC = $3,200). If you use fiat to buy it, that's that, Bitcoin not involved. Alternatively, if you use 10 BTC, the car dealership will convert that into $32,000, which lowers the value of Bitcoin as you correctly pointed out. But, since you haven't spent your fiat on the car, you can simply take your $32,000 and convert it to 10 BTC, essentially undoing the conversion that the dealership made from BTC to USD. The net result is:
* You paid with BTC, but your BTC balance has not decreased
* You spent $32,000 on the car, the same amount you would have with a straight fiat purchase
* Dealership continues supporting BTC payments, because of customer demand that you're helping drive
The last point is *really* important. People who say "don't spend your Bitcoin" don't realize how harmful it is in the long-run. Businesses won't keep supporting BTC forever if its usage among their customers keeps dropping, and we do need businesses to keep supporting it, because those are the building blocks for eventually having businesses use BTC with each other, instead of strictly with the end consumer. Can you imagine the effect on the market cap once companies start holding Bitcoin for their expenditures, instead of selling it instantly as they get it?


Correct, but this makes the assumption that, if you had been paid in dollars, you wouldn't convert it to BTC. If you do convert it, the end result is the same as getting paid in BTC. The only *real* advantage to offering Bitcoin as a payment option for your goods/services, is that it'll expose your customers to BTC, so they may potentially invest.
I reiterate my initial point: what matters is that a transaction involves Bitcoin. Not every transaction will increase the market cap, but every single one will help drive adoption, whereas refusing to spend it does nothing productive.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:12:49
That makes sense, but you're assuming the competition's fees also grow prohibitively high when there's demand for it. If they don't, then people have no incentive to come back to Bitcoin once they have left it, as they'll be happily using another coin that maintains low fees regardless of network usage.

Pretty sure that's a made-up coin by the BCH community, to discourage the use of the term 'Bcash'. But I agree with you, the new coin is called Bitcoin Cash and the fuss about it having 'Bitcoin' in the name is completely unwarranted.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:22:52
Because if everyone thought like you, no business would have ever seen the need implement Bitcoin as a payment option, and the value of Bitcoin wouldn't be anywhere near as high.
If you're so concerned about the inflation rate of fiat, then why are you holding so much fiat that it bothers you? Why not convert it to Bitcoin, and then use that for payments?
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:21:15
I agree with the idea of accepting payment in Bitcoin for your goods/services, but how is that different to spending Bitcoin? There's still someone spending their Bitcoins in your scenario, it's just your customer instead of you. A transaction is a transaction, the involved parties don't matter. The only thing that matters is that Bitcoin is being used.

He's probably betting on yesterday's rise getting matched with a dip in the days to follow, rather than marking the start of a bull run.  Which is as good as anyone's guess, but still, bold move putting it in BCH while you wait for the rebuy.

Not really, that's just traders doing their thing.
1. Have altcoins.
1. Bitcoin crashes, but the altcoin you're holding hasn't yet.
1. Trade them for bitcoin while the price ratio is favorable (this causes the altcoin to drop in value, hence why bitcoin going red makes everything go red).
1. Once the market stabilizes, sell your bitcoin back for more altcoins than you originally had.

Not necessarily cash out, but most of the time, they do want you to buy for their own selfish reasons (more buyers means their BTCs are worth more), not because they want you to succeed. That's why it's important to do your own research before you make investment decisions, and never take the words of strangers as gospel.

Private keys can be represented in [several ways]( but most commonly a 52-character string. Having a private key gives you full control over the funds stored by the key's associated address, so it's very important to keep these safe!
Seeds are a little bit different. A seed is used to create or restore a wallet, including its keys. The advantage of seeds is that they're much easier to type on paper, but the drawback is that they'll only be able to restore keys that were generated by that seed, not ones you've added to your wallet manually.
If in doubt, backup both your seed and all your keys, and keep them somewhere safe.

You could always buy the book with BTC, then immediately convert some of your fiat into crypto so you end up with the same coins you had before. It's effectively the same as buying the book with fiat, and you encourage more business to start supporting crypto.
