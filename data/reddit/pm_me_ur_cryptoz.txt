0 to 20k. 10k is the middle. It's less than 10k, therefore it is closer tip 0 than to 20k.

Because of past performance.  I feel it id strange enough to withstand a lot.  Is closer to its bottom than it is to its top.  So logically, it should go up not down.  There is always a chance for it to go down further,  but ultimately,  a year from now and in the future,  I see it higher than it is now.

I just don't think it will go much lower

No,  I never said that.

Yes,  a gut feeling based on years of watching the market fluctuate.

 yeah,  except 90% of people in south east Asia,  in countries that are dirt poor,  have smart phones.  With internet access.  So.. maybe some African countries are behind,  but not 45%..

You should look into omise go if you think poor people can't afford top use crypto.

Bitcoin and its forks are nothing to me,  I'm an altcoin snob.  Fuck outta here with you. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:12:59
That made me feel good
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:53:54
Because the entire market was down because bitcoin was down.  Alt coins hate btc.. we make all this progress and then we get red when btc gets red. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:19:39
 Was def a joke about btc relatively higher tx fees. Nothing against btc, it was the first idea. But it does have some of the highest fees,  even at their lowest.  I see the community can take a friendly jab,  lol.

I haven't seen a lot of critical thinking on campus these days.  
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:30:31
 obviously not.  Which is why I said at least.  It wasn't any exact figure,  it was an estimate based on being in the space long enough.  The exchange volume is big business, more than enough to prop up an obsolete asset 
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:39:58
I mean,  it's true.  I hate seeing my alts go down even though they are obtaining partnerships,  gaining adoption,  generally becoming more useful than btc. It sucks.  In my mind,  when btc recovers,  and my alts go back to their previous aths, I'm not really thanking btc for that.  I'm thankful that my fortune is changing,  but i also understand that as soon as we no longer need btc as an on ramp,  my alts will move dependant on their own merits.  Which is a much more lucrative case for me,  considering my alts are much more meritorious than dusty ol btc.
And let's be real,  at the VERY least,  btc use is 50% people moving cash into alts.  So as soon as we don't need you,  not only will your artificial value plummet,  but you won't have anyone here to upvote your reposted meme.
I do appreciate what btc started,  and I understand that we wouldn't be here without btc, but we have come to a point where btc is the thing that's holding us back,  no longer propelling us forward.

I'm not sure why you just listed a bunch of problems about the coin you are defending,  but that you for making my point.  
Firstly,  I already said that btc is OG and paved the way for the rest of us.  Kudos. We will will take it from here. 
Second,  btc power consumption is a net negative,  and people are actively pursuing less hungry options.  Saying that btc could power a country is misleading.  What you should have said is " it would take an entire country to power btc". Btc doesn't produce power for anyone,  it takes it.  So stop that. 
On to the numbers. Saying it has a 5.7b revenue stream is great.  But then following it up with a 3b operating cost readily takes the wind out of the sails.  Nobody is battling an eye at a product with a 40% profit margin.  
So ill go ahead and sum up the current pros  for you since you failed. 
- btc is currently the best fiat on ramp to other crypto. 
- btc is currently a reasonable store of value. Willing to say great store of value for those of you who can hold a year or more. 
- btc is known by many,  and understood by few.  This is a pro because as more people begin to understand it,  more people will see that there is any alt out there for every one off btc intended uses.  All of which do it better. 
And in case you were wondering,  bch is garbage too. I'm not a bch troll. Bch is literally bitcoin, but slightly faster and cheaper.  With a quarter of the name recognition.
