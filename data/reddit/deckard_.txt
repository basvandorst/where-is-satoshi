If you don't understand that concept it is kind of hard to explain how to pay in btc :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:08:30
Well how do you pay 12000 dollars when you have 20000 euros?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:00:10


No, you need to pay taxes if you exchange with profit in the US.


You are the one asking the questions.


Like the US is the only country in the world who don't follow the climate agreement? Or setting their embassy in Jerusalem? Or the U.S. does not use the metric system? Or 10000 other subjects? I don't think the U.S. has that much influence anymore where the government dictates a kind of policy the rest will follow.

Btc is global so I'd exchange it to another currency than the local. It didn't stop China.


Probably. I would only recommend doing this if you have a lot to save. If you only have a few hundred bucks and your house burns down, there are other ways to keep it save. Your drive can be totally burnt down and the next day you'll have your wallet again. 
[Here is a whole article about it](


The fact you got spyware installed is a problem on its own. I think btc is one of the least problems you'll have to deal with.


No. But you also don't pay taxes over it. You also don't pay bankservices for holding the money. 
You just have to know what you are doing with it.

What do you mean by 'lose power'?
If governments make it illegal you can still use it. The technology stays and it is very simple to implement. A few years ago it was being used more in the public (restaurants, coffeeshops, etc) because it was very cheap and easy to use. Nowadays it so much of worth it is hard to do such exchanges at the moment ( is being worked on it )
Governments only insure an x amount of money, but not by all banks. 
Off course you can have access to your money if your house burns down, there are different ways to store it. Each with advantages and disadvantages. 
But you are right, you have to take all the responsibilities a bank has. But the good part is, you are full in control.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:01:09
The whole point is you have direct access, always. Instead of keeping it at a bank. Don't store it on an exchange but on your drive.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:54
I don't know what you mean by that. The dollar in everyone's bank also cannot be cashed out by everyone. 
There is money coming out of money, but that is nothing new. That has nothing to do with cryptocurrency, that concept is ages old. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:01
Because like BTC it is just another currency. Euro vs Dollar also fluctuate. Only those two already have been balanced out. The value of BTC is rising because more and more people are on the bandwagon to have some coins.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:07:21
You don't need to have one drive in one house.
At the certain point in the future, there is no need to exchange. For now you can exchange if you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:59:21
To me an ATH has to be 24h settled on every exchange.

Reditor for 4 days. Says enough with all these multiple accounts trying to get some negative responses over this subject. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:35:42
and then?? Please! Tell! You can't just stop your story.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:04:02
I thought that was the whole idea behind bitcoin. It is the reason why I have them.

That is a nice lesson, to put it in practice i will forget this

Ok Metallica... Show your money.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:00:35
It is for their piss-poor opinions
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:37:06
It used to be a payment service. I remember a few years ago I bought coffee and pizza with it.

A lot of the time they still have to fill in a ridiculous address-bar with words weird filled in with dots to buy some new clothes.

@_date: 2017-11-06 23:23:13
I thought the main purpose is to eventually never sell bitcoin, but use because its value is and use is far better than with fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:40:41
I never sold bitcoin cash, would I still have it?
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:03:52
every porn movie is somewhere to be found in pi itself. even your complete hardrive. So you already have a backup. Just need to have the right address.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:16:07
I think I would sell it when it was a few years later. Oh wait.. I'm still doing that. And probably it only will be a small part I will be selling. Or maybe I don't even need to.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:13:13
You mean 400 :(

I think it will reach 3000. But I thought it would be a bit slower.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:55:08
I think I will get all my assets off BTC. Very unfortenate, but if people want to gamble, than don't do it with my money.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:18:29

So you paid in gift cards not BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:57:17
Why a hardware wallet, you can use just a simple software wallet like your mobile or desktop.
Most of my Bitcoins are in cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:00:25
Android has the 'Bitcoin wallet' 
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:59:48
"That'll be 20 bucks!"
"Here is 250"
"What? No tip?"
"Oh sorry, 255"
Transaction costs....
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:13:21
Yes but maybe it will within a few months 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:59:32
It is not a share so you are not required to buy a whole one. Can be just for 10 dollars or maybe you want 0.001 btc. You decide.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:41:11
Although I have invested in Bitcoin I completely agree with you. It still is frustrating to me that I cannot use it in a way to pay straight forward like a few years ago. In fact I do not want to sell it back to fiat but use it as a day to day currency.
With all these big fees there is no reason for consumers and companies to make use of it. And other much easier technology is gaining easily.
No more do I have to pin but just scan my de debet card to pay for something. Or use a phone as a swipe. Why even bother to change from currency? The technical argument is totally lost. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 20:14:53
Why can't I just keep my 500 uBTC? It's my money!
