"I'm a tax-related lawyer, and I'm willing to take money from people that use bitcoin".

The fact that no-one has reproduced this supposed invention by Tesla since his death leads me to believe it's fake.

Tommy took the fall for his son.  What an awesome dad.

I say it's pretty annoying.

This is the same company that lobbies to make it more difficult for you to pay taxes.

And now i'll be able to share my experience with my friends on Facebook!
@_date: 2014-04-26 13:44:03
This was not in the USA, was it?
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:17:05
You do, by giving up a portion of your company.

But how will I convert my hogsheads to rods?

Wow, that was the first blue screen I've seen in years.

I'm about to launch a site myself that accepts bitcoins.  This post makes me feel confident.

So, what's the Netherland's excuse for not exploring the galaxy right now?

Just what I need, FUD when eating a hot dog.

Not for recurring payments it doesn't.  At least,  not with the automatic payment processing of current providers.
@_date: 2015-08-01 00:07:44
Totally a pizza

Libertarianism is the belief that government money should be spent to arrest, prosecute, and jail a black man for the crime of sitting in a racist's diner.

Well, good thing my neighbors don't have money for a lawyer, then.  After their minimum wage got cut, they barely have enough money for food (because their foodstamps were cut).

BRB... Gonna go burn some of my trash in MY yard.

Not sure that would stick.  I don't think police officers can force you to hand over your password.  (5th Amendment rights and all that)

RAND PAUL!!!
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:11:16
Hmm.. I wish this could work for recurring payments (subscriptions).
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:24:15
A very valid question.  Not sure why you got downvoted.

@_date: 2013-04-30 19:26:54
I'd say "The inventors of bitcoin"
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:30:06
Wait... don't credit card companies already SELL this type of information to your competitors?
EDIT: 6/9/2013: and it appears that the NSA is involved too...

Don't forget to hit the gym after you lawyer up.
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:16:14
I can be your friend, and I promise I won't spend all the BTC's at once. ;)
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:19:31
Interesting how they are doing this in Nairobi.  Less regulation to 'experiment' perhaps?

Your wallet wouldn't be built-in.  It would just open your wallet app.

AND the pluralization? 
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:55:43
It will then take 10+ years for all the major browsers to adopt it... ;)

I don't know if I ever really liked Liteboy.  I mean... sure ... some people do... but I personally don't.
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:26:15
kinda [scary](
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:26:45
Well, sure.. that's a good first step.  Definitely going to ask it. 
But when they ask "What's bitcoin"? What does one say back?  
I'm half tempted to provide some technical services for free to help them set up... just looking for some feedback on redditors that have successfully convinced a merchant.

Shut up, and take my money!
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:22:44
So then it comes down to:  How do I build reputation?  By risking a sell.
