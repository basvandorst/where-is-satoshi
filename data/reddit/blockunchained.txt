Also, regarding point 1, according to my very humble understanding, the current economy relies on massive amounts of continuous consumption due to being backed by inflation and debt. This is unsustainable in the long run due to declining resources and increasing pollution. Perhaps a deflationary currency may in some way help us make better decisions about purchases and lead to less unnecessary consumption.

As interesting as it is to compare the adoption of bitcoin and the internet, isn't there a huge difference? In 1993 there was huge barrier to entry for connecting to the internet: the cost of a computer + modem + ISP. Not to mention the technical ability required (perhaps similar to bitcoin now).
With bitcoin, there are zero barriers to entry, apart from perhaps faith and (at the moment) tech-savvy - which is arguably much more prevalent that in 1993. Therefore, with the right infrastructure eventually in place, could we not see a much faster adoption rate?

I think customers would see amazon's acceptance of bitcoin as a sign of approval. Many may purchase bitcoins solely for making amazon purchases, and when/if the price crashes they would see whatever holdings they had disappear. Whther rational or not I think there'd be a lot of bad feeling to go around.

I'm a total layman when it comes to economics, so maybe I shouldn't be commenting on it, but if he starts a business, and I invest in it with bitcoins, and his business is earning bitcoins, won't my investment increase at faster rate than if I keep my bitcoins under my mattress?
edit: I concede that there may be less incentive for me to invest, depending on my risk aversion

'Average Joe' non-owners may not be driven to obtain bitcoin because Amazon accepts bitcoin, but they may be driven to for many other reasons. International payments, currency for travelling abroad, investment, more control, avoiding negative interest savings accounts (in the future), avoiding Cyprus-style economic collapse, etc. Having Amazon accept them may just present another channel for spending those bitcoins, and would lend credibility to the currency, perhaps driving more adoption.
Ideally however, merchants like Amazon would offer discounts to buyers who use bitcoin for payment, to account for avoiding credit card fees and significant cost reductions at each stage of their international supply chain.

Can i venture to make some very brief responses to your points:
1. We can agree that it is vague and can only be used in combination with other evidence. However, if you look at the historic trading volumes on the exchanges, they don't line up with the graph, so it's not just increased buying and selling of bitcoins. And if it does just show that people are moving bitcoins from one wallet to another, then it looks like gradually more people are doing that, therefore adoption is increasing.
2. In this case can you suggest a better source than blockchain.info? Considering that their data is regarded as pure, I think in this instance it is fine for them to list themselves as the source.
3. The merchants are still accepting bitcoins and cutting out the usual banking middle-men, credit cards/banks, therefore reducing the value lost in the transaction. They are also avoiding all the complications that can come with accepting a credit card payment. Eventually, as this adoption continues, and the merchants' international suppliers start accepting bitcoin (where the advantages and cost savings of bitcoin are even greater), you can imagine a point at which it makes more sense for the merchant to start retaining some of their bitcoin revenue.
4. For the reasons above and many more, the number of bitcoin orders is increasing. I'm not sure why we all know it won't.
5. The volatility of bitcoin has decreased over time so far. With greater adoption comes greater liquidity and a more mature market, which should lead to even less volatility.
If we were playing a full game from 2009 until now, the scoreboard is looking pretty good. Even for the last quarter.

But if his company does provide returns (profits), in bitcoin, then my returns will be greater than if I just sat on my bitcoins. So the decision to invest is the same whether I'm using an inflationary or deflationary currency.

Large successful companies have too much to lose by adopting bitcoin. If the bitcoin experiment fails, there's going to be a lot of egg on their face, a lot of angry customers and a lot of bad PR. 
Bitcoin adoption is likely to be driven from the bottom up by smaller, more nimble players.

As anyone who's watched an Adam Curtis documentary will know, science and technology are never apolitical and will inevitably be politicised as various powers seek to exploit it. Unless the bitcoin community decides together on the direction of bitcoin, it will be decided for us.

No there is nothing like localbitcoins.com in China. localbitcoins.com is offered in Chinese these days but there is not much activity in China apart from the major cities (Beijing, Shanghai).
I doubt Mycelium is being used for bitcoin sales apart from a tiny minority, agin only in the major cities. Chinese bitcoin exchanges are highly efficient so that might be reducing the need for a local exchange method.

I don't see why, if implemented correctly. What is a phone or a computer if not a collection of parts? A modular smartphone could open up all sorts of possibilities as small module manufacturers pop up filling all kinds of niches. It could save the consumer money as they don't need to upgrade the whole device when all they might need is a new processor and a bit more RAM for the new OS. Or a new screen cos the old one got cracked.
All this on top of possibly the most important point - that it may help reduce the huge amount of electronic waste that consists of devices and components that are still fit for purpose.

As far as I'm aware, there isn't a coinmap type website (I live in China). Statements from the central bank have implied that bitcoin should not be used as a currency, so I doubt retailers accepting bitcoin (there isn't many!) would like to highlight their locations to the authorities in case there's a crackdown. 
In my opinion bitcoin adoption with retailers will lag behind the world until china as no option but to legalise it, or maybe legalise a different crypto currency that they have an advantage in.
On gut feeling, I'd agree with you that China's marketshare of bitcoin is overestimated, but it does have three-four major exchanges (that's about the same as the whole of Europe and a whole lot more than the States) all showing significant liquidity, so it shouldn't be underestimated either.
I'm going to the Bitcoin Summit in Beijing next month, so will hopefully get more of an idea about where adoption is going there!

* Don't have to apply for one
* Reduced fees for merchant, which (technically) in turn should be passed on to the consumer
* Can make payments to international merchants without fees and below market exchange rates
* Details can't be stolen then used for fraud
* Can't be accidentally overcharged
* Can make anonymous payments
* More control over balance and statements
* Only need a smartphone, don't need to bring card/wallet

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to claim bitcoin is already completely superior or more convenient than using a credit card. But in the future, given the rate of development and innovation, I think we can expect the advantages to gradually increase.

BTCChina has just disabled CNY deposits. See this post: 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:11:40
It's confirmed. I was just about to post the same news and then saw this.
I made a CNY withdrawal from BTCChina through Tenpay last week, but just discovered that it has failed and the CNY are back in my exchange account. Guessing Tenpay rejected all the transfers they were processing after their meeting with the PBOC.
According to the notice withdrawals should still be working normally so I'm guessing they do straight bank transfers now, will try again in a bit.
China's price is taking a massive hit because of this and at time of writing is over $100 away from the Bitstamp price.
All in all very disappointing news, but at least once it all settles my localbitcoin business may start booming...
