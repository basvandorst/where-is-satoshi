I think thats the problem majority feels. I understands that you have solid business plan, but that is not documented properly as a business plan document with target, projected income, etc.
What everyone can see here is a claim that you have a solid business plan with few throw out ideas in comments.
In short, people expect more proper documentation.
Don't get me wrong, I love where this is going if it is going right. But things can turn sideways, and if it did it will go horribly especially when no documentation is to be found anywhere.

They just need to get their cash out of bank. If they don't have the cash, how can they buy bitcoin?
Even if they have bitcoin, there is no point if they can't spend it on anything to survive daily.

And use passphrase for different businesses. 1 key to rule them all. Genius!
I really love this solution.

Finally, some service that work in Malaysia. You definitely will get my business.
It is surprising that a country with over 60% of internet adoption (among the highest) still lacking in bitcoin adoption.
I guess that contribute to our banking system being available to almost everyone in the country.

All developers which skeptic towards 20mb increase have affiliations with off-chain/side-chain solutions. Conflict of interest at its core.

The only problem I have is that all of VPN provider I tried is banned from within my organization. I can't even make the connection to the VPN servers.
How do I get away with it?

I'm sorry, but which local exchange for Malaysia that you're using? AFAIK, there are no active exchanges in Malaysia.
The only exchange that I know off has volume of less than 5BTC/24hrs. What a shame.
Btw, how can I be part of the team? Would love to support for Malaysia.

From their perspective, it is not cheating and they meant no cheat at all. They are just playing around the bush, as per OP..
This cultural different is spot on to most of Asian countries not only China.

You need to plug in the trezor to be able to spend.

I'm streaming again view of PETRONAS KLCC TWIN TOWERS, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
It is an outstanding view.. and lets test the system while at it.
Leave some feedback!

I believe you're referring to 'change address'. Yes, even change address should not be reuse. Receiving address should not be reuse too.

Best speech of the decade. So much truth that people cease to see and in denial.
@_date: 2015-05-24 15:03:45
Its the same shit as gambling/drinking.
People who have been gambling/drinking don't really think what they are doing is bad. It is just it is.
To change that, people need to do it in step.
1. Embrace that it is in their root and need to realize that they are doing it.
2. They need to realize what they are doing is not the right way to do things.
3. And change it.
Easier said than done.

Not making excuses, nor to justify that it is ok to do so. Just merely stated the fact on how they think and behaves. Ultimately, I do believe in honesty, integrity &amp; professionalism in doing business.

Yes, those positions are publicly known well before the conflict existed. You don't need to have time machine. Because the conflict is now, not before.
How about we move on and embrace the changes?
Guess nope. It will make what you are working on (side-chain/off-chain) useless. That is harsh. Maybe not useless. It will make those solution less favourable.
@_date: 2015-01-10 13:14:11
Seems like they care a lot. A lot of people seems to trust them anyhow, at least to be mining with them. Just not highly speak of around here. I seriously wonder why.
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:33:26
I'm using the portable though. If that might help.

Yes that answers.
Guess a good banking system does slows the adoption of bitcoin. People don't feel the need of it.
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:38:25
Well, they acknowledge it may work but not being supported. Sadly not working with my Mastercard.
At least I don't have any difficulty to buy with CEX.io. Bought some coins and transferred to wallet. Just in few mins without hassle.
Thats why I'm not sure why it is not a good option to others around here?
@_date: 2015-05-24 14:46:10
Absolutely, that is why I mentioned 'most' and not all.

Sorry for my ignorance. Can you elaborate more? In what way they are fraud? I don't seem to find it anywhere.

USD 0.25 + 4.5 % for me.
I know quite high but is totally acceptable for the conveniences since most of seller in localbitcoins.com do charge more or less the same, often more.
@_date: 2015-05-10 05:37:17
it depends on the severity of the bugs. There are a lot of bugs being awarded for more than $100.

I found out that your conversion rate is a bit higher than average market. Around 1.6%. If people wondering, that's their business model.

Best way to manage your key so far I believe. I prefer to use this rather than Trezor because you don't have to carry any device. It is there hiding in the plain sight.

It is easier to convince people to download stupid Tom Cat rather to use bitcoin. No surprise there since human generally just stupid.

The money in oil will suck bitcoin dry. The depth that bitcoin has at its current state can't even scratch the surface of oil industry. It is just too small of a market depth.

This is not the subreddit I signed up for. Heck, this is not the bitcoin I signed up for. 
Now we are more like federal reserve. Time to get out. 
Physical gold seems to be better all the way. Nobody can say shit about how I manage it.

In the bitcoin world of consensus, nobody is standing in front or beside anyone. Everyone is standing on their own.
People can vote whatever way forward they want given all the options. Vote as you want and live with the consequences.

W3 decision making is kind of spot on. They don't have issue with that. Their only problem, which is really not a problem for web is just the speed of implementation of features.
Bitcoin don't even have any feature schedule lay down!
Just look at Fedora Linux OS, even they have what kind of feature they are planning for the next coming 6 months!
More often that not, some shitty small open source project have better project management than this shitty so call breakthrough invention of the centuries.
