If the hackers got hold of the wallet backups they would slowly brute force the passwords, probably a few wallets at a time. So it would make sense to break a decent amount of passwords before starting the theft.

That's where I think you are wrong, full anonymity is very important for the average Joe. 
Any person that knows your BitCoin addresses can track the amount of funds you have and how you use them. By tracking your transactions a person could possibly link them to specific businesses and locations, by examining the amount of btc spent it's possible guess what item you've purchased. Almost anyone could stalk every monetary transaction you do. 
This is a serious issue of privacy and it could be a very useful tool for criminals to target you.

No. Unlike movies and music, you can't copy bitcoin. To take bitcoin you would have to get the person's private key without his consent trough physical or digital means (which is wrong by itself) and then use it to deprive him of his bitcoins which is the definition of theft.
I sympathise with artists who feel that their work is unappreciated and can barely make ends meet, but attempting to fight copying is a fruitless endeavour. They can rely on donations, income from live performences and there's always crowdfunding sites like patreon, kickstarter, indiegogo, ect.. 
If someone is really good at what he does, he can find a ways for people to support him

According to you we should all focus on BitCoin's economical problems and spend absolutely no time or effort trying to find ways to improve the flawed architecture of cryptocurrencies. And I completely disagree. 
Creating a technically solid currency should be the  priority and ONLY when that's achieved we should start pushing it for mass adoption.
Currently all cryptocurrencies are viewed as wacky internet money, and I think that's a good thing. It gives us time to iron out all the flaws (lack of anonymity,size of the blockchain,slow transaction confirmations,51% attacks) and find the best combination of algorithms and technologies that would work for mainstream usage.
I'm not saying that ZeroCoin is the money of the future. But it's definitely a step at the right direction.

What you're doing is comparing apples with oranges. You can't 'copy' bitcoin the same way you can copy digital media. What the attacker is doing in your scenario is abusing the system by creating fake bitcoin balances and then using them to scam other people. Once the security loophole gets fixed all the fake bitcoin would vanish. While it's not technically theft, you can definitely label it as fraud. 
However it's a completely different case with movies. When you copy it becomes yours, the data isn't going to disappear and it's not like you paid money for a copy of Dr. Strangelove and a few hours later it instead turned into a copy of a 60s german porno. 


How is asking for donations and crowdfunding the equivalent to begging? If someone enjoys your work and sends you money, it's similar to paying for a product.

It doesn't matter what video creators and musicians want. The second they share their content with someone else, the person has ownership over it and can share it with other people. This is simply the nature of information and using the government to force people to pay for viewing your work is wrong. 
I'm not saying that consuming content that you enjoy and not supporting the artist is moral, but that doesn't mean that the authorities should be involved.

I predicted this half a year ago. Storing your private keys on the internet is a bad idea, even if they are encrypted. 
Hashed passwords can be brute-forced a lot easier than most people like to believe, especially if they happen to have predictable patterns and words in them.
 
A good solution would be a pure client-side version of blockchain.info where your password would be a randomly generated AES 128 key, translated into 16 words, each word representing 1 byte. That way you would have full security of AES and be completely immune to bruteforcing, however it would have the downside of remembering the 16 words.
@_date: 2014-03-10 09:17:32


No. It's impossible for it to achieve a 8 trillion market cap in such a short amount of time. I'm still skeptical if we'll ever reach a 100 billion.


BitCoin is always going to be worth **something**. The only reason why it would be worth zero was if the network fell apart or the protocol failed but definitely not because of bad reputation or FUD.
@_date: 2014-11-15 20:11:05
From my point of view private keys, just like passwords aren't property because they can be copied. However, bitcoins are property because they cannot be copied inside the network and can only be moved from one address to another. 
So I consider moving someone else's bitcoins without the original owner's permission or any intent of returning it in case it was lost as theft
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:12:23
Why? What's so wrong with that? It would come with strict instructions how sweep the funds, NOT import the key. At least that way if ChangeTip is hacked the funds are safe. Of course this is assuming ChangeTip erases any trace of the private keys after sending them to the receiver.
I don't see how this any worse than the current model..

In theory, mining pools could blacklist the address and choose not to include it's transactions in their mined blocks. I think it would be perfectly in line with Bitcoin's protocol, considering that they have the right to discriminate transactions based on their fees, might as well on other parameters.

Exactly.

I like SegWit, I hope it gets adopted. Finding ways to compress transactions is an excellent start, but it's only a temporary solution that will take a while to implement until all the miners to switch to it.


The average transaction on PayPal is $60, that's not exactly a piece of candy or a snickers bar. Just people paying for genuine goods and services, something that should surely be doable with Bitcoin.


I never advocated unlimited blocks because I consider it risky. Nor is supersize the solution, but as time goes on and the network exponentially grows so will the block size, it's an unavoidable physical reality.
@_date: 2016-12-03 12:38:03
I never said it was your fault. My point is that these issues never existed before, but only now that we [hit the limits]( of the network. I know people argue that all you need is to pay a higher fee, but the problem is that if a 1MB block can support 500 transactions and there's a 1000 people that want to make an instant transaction, then no matter how big of a fee they pay it's impossible for all their transactions to be included in the future block. The simplest solution would just be increasing the max block size to 2MB which would allow everyone to take a deep breath for another year until we hit this limit again
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:00:44
By that logic the android wallet is unusable because it doesn't allow custom fees, this situation is a total shitfest
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:42:36


Yes, it does matter. People that want to move their money to an exchange, a bitcoin debit card or any other 3rd party service need their transactions to a appear in the blockchain. Waiting for hours for it to happen is annoying and will only get worse as adoption continues to grow.
It's silly to think that 1MB will always be enough. Is there anything magical about that number? Why not go down to 100KB or 10KB instead? Think of all the space you could save! I'm sure there wouldn't be any consequences at all.
@_date: 2016-12-04 18:01:58
Can you point out how any of my arguments were irrational? You're just dismissing them without providing any concrete answers which makes me believe you have none.
Let me ask you another simple question. Let's say a block can support 500 transactions on average and Bitcoin users produce 600 transactions every 10 minutes on average. How is it possible for the blockchain to store all of those transactions? How is it sustainable? I'd also like you to take into account that PayPal processes 260 000 transactions every 10 minutes.
I don't want this come off as confrontational, but I just want to understand your reasoning. So far I don't see any consensus in the community on how to solve these serious issues which makes me worried about the future of Bitcoin.

This has become way too much of nuisance to deal with and completely unappealing for the average Joe who cannot afford these fees and long wait times.

Awesome products, that block clock thing is extremely overpriced though, you're better off making your own with a pi.

I literally said that the site was a trap, used fake chatbox messages to appear real and called it fake in the title. Do you lack reading comprehension that much?

On the bright side, people will start being more cautious about the software they install and open source applications might become more popular

Dogecoin's transaction fees are cheaper which would give players more liquidity. It's currently 0.015 cents compared to Bitcoin's 5 cents

All limited items in MMO's have real world value because you need time to acquire them (which is very valuable). That's why people spend real money to buy stuff on Runescape, WoW, TF2, ect.. Gold in online games is just a pseudo fiat currency.

There can be 100s of initiators, only requiring one to be honest for the system to be secure.

Physical theft is not an issue. You can encrypt the wallet with a password and memorize a seed to restore your private keys.

According to Betteridge's law, no.

What prevents Trezor from having a backdoor, or the Bitcoin code, or the linux kernel? Ultimately it all goes down to trust in other people to audit the software and hardware. If it's produced by an established brand and is open source I don't think it will be anymore riskier than it is now

Software only 'dies' if people stop using it, and Truecrypt is still pretty popular

That's why we should start measuring the value by the amount of pizzas you can buy with it, PIZZA/BTC

Aww, I wanted more gore ):

But the seed only covers 2^128 of combinations while a private key has  2^256 possible combinations. Doesn't that make the seed less secure than generating a random private key?
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:59:09
Will they be increasing the size of the default seed? 128 bits doesn't cover the full security of a private key

It depends on the definition of a troll. Just because someone is sarcastic or willfully ignorant about something doesn't make him a sadist, but an average person. Most people are trolls, but they don't realize or admit it. However, people that consider trolling as their favorite pastime on the internet are probably more 'dedicated' to it and view it as a form of harassment

I think adding an address flair would be a good idea. Something in the form of an icon that reveals the addr when clicked

Prices will go to 5-10 dollars when wallets start getting mass produced in China. And you if can't afford that you probably don't have access to computers, cellphones or internet in the first place.

Why do we even bother giving Paycoin publicity anymore? It was proven of being a scam countless times already, let it sink to obscurity so it could fade away and die
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:50:04
Or you could just use hardware wallets
