well whats the other option? Because you simply **cant decentralize** exchange, its aleays going to be in the hand of Companys. The best way to deal with this is to have an monitoring party like an govermental authority to regulate these Exchanges **so things like Mt Gox and this "hack" wouldnt happen anymore**.   
You simply cant dezentralize exchange, its aleays centralized

well good luck with forcing **companys** into having them monitored by private individuals and private organizations.  
This is just wishfull thinking, there is no way you can enforce these things in reality. Because at this point you will need help from the lawmaker.   
1. Who is gonna insure losses like this?  
2. If you suggest private control, why should any of the general public and world population trust these people. And just "its not the goverment" is not enough.  
  
If you want Bitcoin to truly succeed as a trustworthy Money for the general public and world population, you need the lawmaker on your side to regulate exchanges and insure that losses dont happen like this.   
Because at this point why would anyone invest in it, if it isnt guaranteed that theyre investment just doesnt suddenly "disappear" with a "hack" like this. If this continues nobody from the public will trust bitcoin anymore.   
**and thats the true damage these things are causing.**

i know its a unpopular opinion here, but as you can see Bitcoin again faces backslashes due to greed of few single persons. Who ultimately will scare away the most of the common people.  
Because if regular people will use this service, they have to trust the Exchange Services, you cant decentralize them.  
The only Solution here (as i said this is an unpopular opinion here) is more goverment control over these Exchange Services.  
Yes they are greedy, but with Govermental Control you could easily setup Rules, which wouldnt let these things happen over and over again.
