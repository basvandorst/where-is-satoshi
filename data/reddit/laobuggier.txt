That's intuitively leaking. I would explain that as "leaking" to the layman without having to mathematically prove it.

Just like dollars and cents.
1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshi.
1 dollar = 100 cents.

Since the decay curve converges towards 0, what is the price asymptote? i.e. What are the maximum and minimum expected prices in the next 2-3 halving cycles?

Gold will be the choice of weapon for the anti-US countries in the near future. China now knows they have a narrow window to assert dominance on the global stage. They will not let 10 years of gold accumulation (and a massive amount in the ground) go to waste just because of bitcoin. 
So, gold may win the battle, but they won't win the war. Cryptos will.

Shit until it isn't.

I would love to. Would call it "Parallels".  Alternate timelines and realities sort of thing.

Fiat did not topple, in the 2020s governments rushed to back their currencies with bitcoin and gold before the general populace lost all confidence. However, at the end of the day, the USD was demoted to a regional currency like how GBP lost its reserve currency status with the decline of the british empire.

You must be that fabled $20k bitcoin buyer.

Perfect, thank you.
