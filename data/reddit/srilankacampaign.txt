Not a taxation expert but we are not a registered charity in the US or UK, so you could not claim gift aid in any event.

We decided to offer the service and see how high the demand was first. I imagine at the moment we would sell them for pounds (we bank in the UK) on the open market and then use the pounds to fund our activities.

I work for them so you shoudn't take my word for it. But you can check out our website [ and bank on the credibility of our chairman Edward Mortimer (Kofi Annan's former speechwriter) and board of directors.
Or AMA that would help you confirm I guess.
EDIT: as for insight into what we are doing try [our blog]( and [twitter](

It is actually pretty useful as many of our supporters in Sri Lanka have been concerned there will be repercussions from the military if they are found to have sent us money.

Sure but **we are 100% legal in the US and are always likely to be**. We may well be banned in Sri Lanka at some point (at the moment we are merely frowned upon) but I doubt that would have much impact on the bitcoins.
Also if it is a concern can't you just use a one off wallet?

I can assure you we are not pro LTTE, and indeed have been highly critical of the LTTE. If you don't believe us have a look at our council of advisors and ask yourself if they would be involved in an LTTE supporting group.
I also have to add that the LTTE have now been almost completely destroyed, and the few survivors are working closely with the Sri Lankan Government. Several of the key members of the LTTE leadership are now cabinet ministers.

I'm sorry, and not having a go, and of course you are entirely free to spend your money as you see fit. But I don't understand the risk. I'd say we are about as likely to be blacklisted by the US Government as Amnesty International.
Edit: and surely even then, there are ways to anonymise it. This was the currency of Silk Road, I really think giving it to a registered human rights NGO is one of the safest things you could do with it.
