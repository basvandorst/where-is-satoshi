That's a Data center, so the use of a VPN is pretty much guaranteed.

So does it say anything about whether or not other currencies on the exchange will be liquidated
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:22:45
What does that have to do with people losing Bitcoin.

Who are those people you tagged?

Guccifer was just some Romanian hacker, lots of people knew about him. How does he have anything to do with Russians?  
 We know nothing about Guccifer 2.0..  expect for these hacks.

Honestly this is ridiculous.  
If bitcoin is to fail, it will be in no small part due to this never ending feud. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:09:20
admittedly I was using coinbase because of how easy it was but no longer. doesn't sound like they know what they're doing at all. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:19:54
yeah it happens all the time in stock exchanges. When people start selling erratically, then more people see the price decline, then more people sell. It's a slippery slope.

I transferred all my bitcoin (and a little ethereum) to the Jaxx wallet. Its really simple and AFAIK very secure. It also has shapeshift.io integrated into the app for conversion with ethereum. I will be using Poloniex if I want to do any trading with USD.

Cool, thanks for explaining that

That's perfect lol, "hold on for dear life"

I'd sure be interested

coinbase is great for people just starting out.  
where would you recommend people take their bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:38:31
It wouldn't make it illegal, but the government would have grounds to spy on because you use tor, right? 
@_date: 2016-06-13 10:57:40
Yes! Is this a normal trend of a price bubble? Because this looks somewhat similar to the dot.com bubble on the NASDAQ stock exchange.  
Also you forgot the very first [bitcoin bubble](

I think your view is interesting, and I agree that capitalism is great but, I also think it can get out of control sometimes.   
Just because I like the 'what if game', what would stop road builders from increasing the price of using roads to ridiculous levels? or increase the fee for using them without telling anyone?

What makes them safer? (legit curious in the technology not looking to start a flame war)
@_date: 2016-11-05 15:26:22
All valid arguments, I'd like to continue the discussion if you don't mind? (I'd like to keep in mind we're all friends here)  


  
I disagree, You can have a clear leader and have a decentralized network. Let me use ETC as an example of this.  
The community has just as much power to develop Ethereum as Vitalik and the foundation does. A significant group of people came into disagreement with the fondation, the two sides could not come to an agreement, so they decided to take development of ethereum into their own hands, which is just fine. They are still part of our community, and we keep their valid argument in the back of our minds. 


  
I believe it moves at just easily enough. There was a lot of discussion about the hardfork before it was decided. And if we do move into a bad direction, which undoubtedly will happen, we can also go back, and try again. Even if that happens, we are still making progress.  
  


  
How long has this debate between small / big blocks been going on?  
  
I agree with the rest of your points. 
@_date: 2016-11-05 15:05:39
wow, the other arguments that were replied to me were at least decent... but this is pretty low..  
 
You do realize that there are many examples of introverts that have become great leaders. Just off the top of my head, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Abraham Lincoln, so on.  
In fact if you still don't believe me, here is a New York Times [Article]( That talks about Predient Obama, and how his introvertiveness has helped him lead. 
@_date: 2016-11-05 08:19:33
how about this? 
While not technical, I could argue that Ethereum has a strong community that has a clear leader, and because of that is able to move on when troubles arise. 
On the other hand the bitcoin community is bitterly divided in the small block vs big block debate, and for the most part has been unable to move on. 
  
Would you say that this is an advantage ethereum has over Bitcoin?

And because they said they wouldn't do that

I'm subbed to both subs (and have been for probably a year + now), people change their opinion pretty often.  
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:55:22
Regardless of your view on Bitcoin, you should know that this isn't evidence of an account that has been hijacked, that is a pretty big accusation and it's not easy to prove. 
Edit: that -&gt; of

I read what was in the screenshot for the post, it seemed very typical for someone who was switching from the Bitcoin side to the BCH side. Which usually consists of rhetoric against blockstream and nullc
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:11:44
Well what about all of the original big blockers? They all are high profile and had to change their mind about their opinion of Bitcoin at some point? 
I think that just because most people changed their mind early in the process, that doesn't mean people aren't allowed to still change their minds today. 
Regardless of what arguments you wanna pull here, a person changing their oppinion is not proper evidence of a breath of an account. There is a reason why we use passwords and thumbprints ( things that don't change often) when securing accounts  instead of securing accounts with things that do change such as opinions.

Here is just one case, seems to be the most recent one that's got a decent amount of attention. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:30:47
Sure that is one possiblity, or another is that they have an open mind and that changing your mind once on an issue doesn't mean that your beliefs shift with the wind 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:33:52
It really shouldn't matter whether or not it's high profile... Average Joe's and high profile figures change their minds just the same.

I could make a chart with any two failed banks and it would be the same exact graph.

Miners sell a lot of coins, but my understanding is that they will hold on to more coins when the price is rising.

Then what is it?
