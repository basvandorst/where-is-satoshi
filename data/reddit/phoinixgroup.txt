Just saw an advertisement here in Tampa, Fl.   4 million dollar house for sale.  Any amount or all in BTC will be accepted.  This is not the first realtor company to do so. South Fla has many homes you can by for coins.

I was advised to move my coins from Coin base over to  GDAX and from there I could sell my coins and the funds would be deposited into my back acct with zero or very little fees compared to what Coinbase charges.   Is that accurate.
Thank you in advance

Good on ya Dad.   It  really is better to give than receive isn't it?

Thank you so much.  So after I move to GDAX, then sell from there and they will automatically deposit to the same Bank acct info I have currently with Coinbase?

Am taking your advise for sure.  I just moved over all of my BTC from the vault to the coin base wallet. I was planning on selling 250K in the next two weeks.   You think that is soon enough? Was hoping for a lil run up to say over 15 or 16K.  What coin would you recommend my keeping  BTC,  ETH  LTC or BCH?  Would like to have some coins to play with?

I feel that I have also hit my moon. Senior Citizen here with the plan to retire, and pay off my home.  I've only been a buyer for 3 years, never having sold anything.  Would one of you tell me the best way (least commissions) to sell some of my Coinbase coins?  I have a hard wallet if that matters, and a 50,000 coinbase weekly limit. Thanks in advance.

God Bless you.   You did give back and in a mighty way.  Many Blessings WILL come your way; count on it.  I'm really impressed how you took care of your family.

Anyone have any idea how long this tech issue will continue?  Or does anyone have any REAL information on why this correction is so major?
