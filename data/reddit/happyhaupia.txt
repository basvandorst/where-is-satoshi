I'm not trying to defend this particular article, but meteorology and climatology are very different fields of study. Not good to conflate the two.

What do you mean? I'm a big supporter, but I've been concerned about emissions from running Bitcoin, especially to scale as adoption increases.

I've heard several times that Bitmain mines with their machines and then sells them as new. Is there a story behind it or just rumors?
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:08:31
That's pretty neat.

Do we call it anti-FUD?

I would like to buy one of your fine belts please. Send me a link?
