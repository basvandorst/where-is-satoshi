@_date: 2015-12-16 15:34:18
this bubble have no relation to usa its all pure china
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:30:04
why they do not built it over ripple or nubits to make its decentralized for fiat too ?
in real a decentralized exchange is what the real project need for it will gives a much more trust to the bitcoin ecosystem especially after mtgox falls and mintpal and others every day 
@_date: 2014-10-18 17:47:03
i think guys we have to wait a bit for them ... they withdraw me  my alt coin i had with them which was worth 2 figures bitcoins with no problem some hours ago
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:31:56
0.5 % is still high most is under 0.2%
@_date: 2014-11-01 23:57:10
many things happens this year
1)  china ban
2) mtgox close
3) regulation fears
4) big bitcoin merchants spends adoption like ( dell / expedia / dish / gyft ) which force the price to go more down since they sold most of the coins for usd / euro
5) end of the tax year 
6) losing hope since most who join the bubble was not a bitcoin believers but just greed who look for fast easy Gains .
@_date: 2014-10-11 13:47:32
interesting speculation but Karpeles is not the first owner of mtgox he just bought mtgox from the ripple founder who now left ripple and moved to the Stellar project .
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:59:12
yes bitcoin is unaffected by the good news now cause of fear there is much fear as much good news around the fear of the bit license all people is like wait they do not want to put their hard erned money with bitcoin and the next day they found that  bit license comes back with a bad way to regulate it .
once the bit license is showed up i think by jan 2015 the bitcoin price will jump even if its comes out bad as many will say but at least it will puts the main lines  for the bitcoin business .
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:06:33
and i enjoyed it too and double my bitcoins because of it but this beer market can't last for ever . 
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:20:40
no need to kidding .... that's very possible 
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:42:24
i was hope it was real but i am sure that charlie will do it if he got a chance .
true bitcoiners can't keep their mouth shut cause they know that next revolution after internet and  communications have to  be financial.
image your self you wake up in the morning on your holiday and turn on your TV and start watching movies and with just a mobile on your hand you can pay for a movie direct from you couch buy pointing your mobile phone on the QR code on the TV channel and click PAY and voila your netflex or dish network Play the movie  for you after finish the movie you go to xbox live and buy your new game with the same steps as you did for the movie  .
then after finished the watching the movie and playing games you decide to go and buy some grocery and cigarettes on your way you find Beggar or a street band with QR code sign  under it written thanks your your few bits tips and sure you finally reach your small  grocery store and he is happy with his new NFC device he gots from bitpay for just $20 to a accepts Bitcoin payments .
and finally you decide to get back home after you insert your bitcoin debit card on the atm on your street corner to convert your bitcoins to paper money for just 0.1% fee to pay for your house rent cause the owner is so old and dumb and do not understand how to use his freak  technology called bitcoin which took him 5 years already to understand how to make a call from a mobile phone .
welcome to the future .  
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:48:33
ok that's good now more people get their free bitcoin will just through them away and get cash for it and push the price down ... free money 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:54:19
@_date: 2014-05-19 01:55:11
wow this is a great news for me its news better than amazon and paypal combined accepting bitcoin , if you do not know about quickbooks go and read some more .... quick books have very popular POS ( point of sale software ) that used in most restaurants and Bars in USA and UK and some other countries .
@_date: 2014-11-16 12:12:10
it will rise because if bitcoin users buy stuff with btc that day means that they already attend to sell their bitcoin for products but for merchants i think its like 50% only will turn it into fiat while the other 50% will just hold .
@_date: 2014-11-16 09:29:05
good point
@_date: 2014-06-16 13:26:41
i have the same question 
@_date: 2014-11-16 11:58:21
yes i used its before its a great wallet now i use mobile wallet and cold storage
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:45:09
@_date: 2014-09-14 01:41:12
what you most of you do not get that if Russia ban bitcoin then 99.9% china will do the same step cause they are allies in politics . and china holds 75% of the daily trading volume .... so i do not think will not go good in the next months and expect another china bank warning or action  against bitcoin when we got out of this down trend  and starts to move up ... i do not mean to fud but this is what i believe . 
@_date: 2014-10-04 05:25:05
fuck some one have to warn them that this is called HYIP which is totally scam , we do not need to read the  news tomorrow that huge bitcoin company like blockchain.info is a partner on HYIP scam , this is the last thing we need is that bad times
@_date: 2014-05-21 11:20:22
very good news
@_date: 2014-10-08 09:52:50
i am sorry to tell you that you learn nothing yet . you have to learn more and more and more you learn you will know that you was know nothing .
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:06:03
in real you can't surprise most of the people for how the bitcoin and blockchain technology will change the world it will took from you hours and then they will give a fk .
but when you goes to the interesting part about the price how it jump from few cents to over 1000 dollar in few years and how that will happens  again and again  they got their ears open and the dollar sign flash on their eyes and say OK i want to buy bitcoin ... only greed is the real engine of this crazy world .
@_date: 2014-12-24 21:35:28
no cause you do not need to be online to generate bitcoin address 
@_date: 2014-09-09 00:44:58
sad but true ....  i tell you another sad truth that we are going to check sub  $400 in the next few days  .
@_date: 2014-07-21 03:25:16
i totally agreed .... i like this
" They need to understand that they don't regulate Bitcoin, Bitcoin regulates them" .
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:32:33
yes the Global crash will never stops it will happens every few years it will only stops when you stops printing money 
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:54:16
there is a big difference between buy and hold and trading whats if you sells at $30 and buy again at $3 that's means 1000% profit .  
if you did that you was never to regret that you sold at $30 and it was to be a life changer moment for all your life .
meet you guys at $200 for btc do not know how long that will takes to reach $200 but it have to reach the button which is close to the mining cost before we see any real up . 
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:33:38
bankers is very bad at acting lol but i am very serious why bank of England enhance bitcoin ?? this is not the first video they did it before plus they post an article about bitcoin on their website too some time ago .... do they really likes bitcoin that much? or they prepare for something bigger .
@_date: 2014-10-10 07:59:18
good graph but charts tells something else ... the uptrend is almost over and we heading down and if we break the $300 the next down trend it will be real blood we may see btc at $200 or less .. i hope that not happens but this is what charts tells .
only the bear whale is the one who makes this down trend to stops temporarily by his huge sell order but also remember by his order he creates another too many whales who prevent the price to go up more  because any one who bough at $300 and sell now ( $375 ) he makes easy 25% profit . 
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:46:39
yes its not yet just less than a month after BitLicense published. it will be like a rally for who will take the biggest peace of the cake before the others. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:09:43
i am sure you just read the head line ... read the full article 
"The Commerce Department says it won’t accept a proposal that simply allows another government or group of governments to take over the role of the NTIA. "
@_date: 2014-12-28 20:02:16
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:18:53
that's another reason why we will not go up soon .
@_date: 2014-10-02 17:07:58

@_date: 2014-12-15 16:34:52
why all this attack on blockchain.info ? they are not that bad yes they are not the best option but they are still the best for me

@_date: 2014-11-04 20:26:14

@_date: 2014-05-21 00:39:45

@_date: 2014-09-19 12:48:09
do you call this toy ATM ??? 
@_date: 2014-10-17 13:42:08
very good directory but i think you need to add vericoin / darkcoin / xc to Next Generation Crypto Currencies list
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:11:09
this old man is right we still far away from a real bitcoin adoption  what we have now is a huge companies who takes our bitcoin and turn them to dollars ( expedia / dish / dell / ... ) which push the price down and down and makes us looks silly and worth less ... the real adoption   comes when  we separate our self from fiat so we will not need to exchange our bitcoin to fiat so buy and sell will be on bitcoin i do not know how that's possible but that's what we need .
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:08:24
not only this selling actions gives it legitimacy but also accept taxes for btc trades gives it more legitimacy  cause if its illegal currency it can't accept taxes for it .

for all the people who watch the "the Rise and Rise of Bitcoin " please watch its again specially the last 5 min you will find that the it goes very dramatic  the stars of the movie ( Charlie Shrem / mark karpeles  ) one got arrested and the other got bankruptcy both in very bad conditions  and then the sunset not sunrise . THE END
this movie with this bad ending will make the people more afraid from bitcoin than interest .
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:07:43
OK then i am ready to buy all your bitcoins at $300 OK ?
@_date: 2014-11-14 05:43:47

@_date: 2014-12-22 04:59:59
i will not donate my precious bitcoins to any company unless they revels that they will keep most of those bitcoins donations as just bitcoins for the longest time .
i am not ready to send them my bitcoins to just dump them on the market with the lowest price because for them bitcoin is just a free money .
if they want our bitcoin then you have to show respect for that bitcoin at least put a link on their website footer Like " we proudly accept domination by bitcoin the money of the future "  + bitcoin logo .
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:16:28
google any money transfer company you will find more results than Payza have
(google "paypal scam")
(google "western union scam")
usa accused any money transfer company that is not based in usa  as money laundering if they do not give them an access to their members info . under the name of regularity
i am not a Payza member but they been in the market since good time , for me i do not trust my bitcoins for any online wallet , i just keep what i can lose but its good step to see a major payment processor like payza accept bitcoin i hope soon we will see more companies .
good luck payza
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:27:38
yes very true specially after bitcoin found its floor at $300 
@_date: 2014-10-04 04:59:54
very good point maybe that's why we already going down now 
@_date: 2014-10-27 09:39:49
wonderful story and thanks for the man who teach you about bitcoin he was a good man indeed but you was smart too that consider his speech to you .
but please if you want to trade bitcoin just trade normal without no margin trades trade is already a risky job and do not but more risk by using margin trade .
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:01:03
stupid idea
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:00:27
bitcoin will never fails its been 6 years now every year people say the same words about whats if bitcoin fails but every year it showed that it more stronger than the past year whatever the bad news it hits . 
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:09:27
after this story and still many of us still waiting for paypal to accept bitcoin for me i hope it will never will accept it so he do not seizethe his users bitcoins for bla bla and then he drops on us and manipulate the market with the coins he seized .
forgot about paypal we can make whats more bigger than paypal  , paypal had its own age now we want a new age. and remember bitcoin is all about to be your own bank .
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:56:55
this story for me like the end of days is on 2025 .
you do not know what tomorrow will brings and the fight between government controls / spying  and  anonymity /freedom will never ends . solutions will show up and it will never stop.

when the Federal Reserve shut down the bitcoin will be 1 million USD each at least
 (21 million BTC x 1 million USD ) = 21,000,000,000,000  ( 21 trillion USD ) ONLY , i am sure that there is much more than that is already in circulation .
@_date: 2014-10-02 04:05:10
that's only means more price down on black Friday ....
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:47:10
the truth is its just very boring video only watched by us 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:49:30
are you serious.... do you see this as a good news ??? first let me tell you that cnn is against bitcoin in all the past times  .... and by this tweet they want to tell the people not to trust bitcoin since they show it as down 42% year to date.
@_date: 2014-12-24 21:40:34
yes you need to add Ripple &amp; stellar to your platform if you are looking for more customers

another great news
@_date: 2014-10-31 13:38:39
sorry bitreserve i do not trust you with my bitcoins i will not store them with you not even my fiat  cause your  proof of solvency do not mean a shit to me ..... and not because the company owned by a well know billionaire  will make me trust it ... if you want me to trust you you have to give the users the secret keys  of their bitcoins wallets hosted by you and try to spend few thousands of you billions to make the same for fiat do not know if it can be done using ripple network or nubits or whatever . 
service like this make bitcoin more centralized which is agents the concept the bitcoin was build for .
@_date: 2014-09-21 14:56:01
that's not a good sign .... i think any time soon they may block CNY exchangers too . what if that happens ??
@_date: 2014-05-16 20:31:18
they are doing the right thing they first start as free service and once you got Addicted to them they will charge you and you have no option but to only to accept .
btw i love the new way circle will brings the bitcoin to the world its great to buy bitcoin instantly using you credit card and withdraw it to your credit card too thats awesome and will bring more and more people to the bitcoin world very fast .
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:28:54
the simple answer why i do not sell at $500 - $600 and buy back at $300- $200 this is called trading yes it have risk but it worth to risk and the trading is the price maker of bitcoin . so do not get angry from the people who trade bitcoin cause they the ones who buy and sell when its prices goes to $100K - $1M . and they are the ones who defines bitcoin price .
@_date: 2014-11-16 12:06:37
wow interesting its very meant not an accident because its the only icon on the desktop .

@_date: 2017-04-15 07:27:40
i do not have a any bitcoin on bitfinex anymore long time ago but i am very suspicious about their charts they not looks normal for me and that could effect the whole bitcoin market if my fears is true , we do not need a second MTgox again thats all i fear . and i do not think i am the only one who have that fear .
plus if they provide the right proof of solvency , that will support their position on the market plus support the whole bitcoin market . 
@_date: 2017-04-09 01:25:30
thumbs up , totally agree .
@_date: 2017-04-14 21:50:15

@_date: 2017-04-14 19:44:53

if i am not wrong a ripple gateway can freez the user funds ( btc / usd / euro / .....) he trust with the gateway but not the ripple coins (xrp) itself .
so if you trust bitstamp  gateway for you btc or usd or whatever coin or asset  bitstamp can freez your btc or usd you hold with them on its  gateway but not your XRP you hold with the ripple network .. in real its a good news not bad .
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:53:53

@_date: 2015-09-04 15:04:38

@_date: 2015-04-10 00:43:35
the question is how the transactions goes high while price goes lower .. its is real strange do the bitcoin price was manipulated by the mtgox till later 2013 ?  or do china and Russia make huge datacenters to mine bitcoin and through all the mined coins on the market daily ? i do not know but something not good happening or happens before .
@_date: 2015-04-26 16:38:28

    Like most companies and organisations that decide to accept Bitcoin, Barclays won't deal directly with the cryptocurrency—rather, the bank will work with an as-yet-unknown Bitcoin exchange. One possible candidate is Safello: a Stockholm-based Bitcoin startup that Barclays invested in earlier this year.

Australia is just a USA bitch i think banks in USA and Australia and Canada will adopt the blockchain technology but after kill the innovator of the blockchain ( bitcoin ), they have to kill that because once they make their own blockchain they want no competitor which is the bitcoin  itself . they fucken govs and banks never play fair and they die if they stop cheating and scamming people , so never think that bitcoin will be adopted by any USA , Canada , Australia mybe UK bank soon . they way i still too long .

most articles i read they said they want to ban communication encryption like the ones used by whatsapp , facetime , ..... 
i do not think its  possible to ban the whole encryption but ban communication encryption is still possible , like they will not allow apps and software to get approval in uk or most of eu if they use encryption for communication  .
but they just want to take that step as a reason for the pairs attacks while its not the real reason to ban communication encryption but what i can say this fucken govs want to watch us all the time and trace us claim that is for our safety and get down the bad people while they want to do that so they can keep us under their control .
those terrorists can always find encryption apps for their communications no matter how popular it is . but facetime and whatsapp is very popular and used by billions of people around the world and the govs is sad because they can't spy on this communications they feels like they lose control and their main task which is spy on the people lives and know what they fells or what they say or what they want to do ( revolutions as an examples ).
this reminds me when when 911 attacks happens and usa said ok lets war Iraq while the attack happens from el qaida in Afghanistan , but they just want to find a reason for their dirty dreams about the Iraq oil and Bush the son complete his father revenge from saddam hussein . 
fuck this political who drove us into war and hate with lies and they always say we fight terrorists , and now they slip our human right in private communication with the name of fight terrorists too .
@_date: 2015-11-21 19:09:53

@_date: 2015-02-01 01:43:41
