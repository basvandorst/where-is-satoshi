answer is it doesn't, miners decide when your transaction will be mined in a block and only the moment after your transaction is included in a block the nodes (your node) start to confirm them
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:30:20
using bitcoin core client with open ports
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:39:11
basically completely hands-off after it's all done
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:35:12
actually bought it at a local german store 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:21:53
how do you mean? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:48:02
Other than being able to confirm (your own) transactions and therefore supporting and decentrelizing the network not really any, lightning nodes may change that though 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:00:20
haha thanks dude :D
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:53:09
depends how the wallet devs integrate it - maybe theres no need for running "extra" nodes at all since your wallet is the only lightning node you need
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:20:50
Why would I?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:00:51
it's just the standard case from Raspberry Pi 3
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:23:25
since english is not my primary language don't mind me if i'm wrong but from my knowledge confirm = verify in sense of "checking if it's in a mined block and checking if said block follows the rules"
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:32:46
If you mean bandwith wise:
It doesn't take much.
If you mean Data Cap wise:
I don't have any idea how internet contracts work in the USA which is why i can't help you sorry :/  here in Germany it's unlimited Data on home internet but I heard it's different in some places...
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:31:36


is all as of now
lightning may change that 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:25:20
I can only speak for myself and that's how long it took for me dude
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:47:53
Didn't know that thank you! At this point I'll just leave it as is though, since otherwise I'd have a useless USB hub laying around ;)
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:47:06


@_date: 2018-01-17 14:45:53
Shouldn't be to hard, was the 6th item on amazon when searching for "black raspberry pi case" ( in germany )
Good luck though ;)
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:52:12
guess between 7 and 10 days from first launch for me
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:49:37
 helped me along the way but they changed the version-naming on github so you have to clone v0.15.1 instead of 0.15.1 , other than that it's fairly straight forward if you know a bit about linux 
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:17:34
"since it never crashes"?
just look at that 50% swing from apr 13 to aug 13 it clearly is a bubble!!!111!!11
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:22:16
well fuck me, that's what I shoul've done - I already had the whole blockchain on my main computer....
but it's a windows pc so it would probably have messed it up anyways
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:50:00
A 1tb wd usb drive hooked up to a externaliy powered usb hub (rpi cant power it alone) hooked up to a raspberry pi running raspbian with bitcoin core :)
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:54:13
How come this one is so much less efficient then their other one? ( 3.5TH @ 1000 vs 16TH @ 1600 )
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:08:46


@_date: 2018-01-12 23:32:43
i've been subbing with btc 3 years ago dude... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:21:30
I can't even tell you how it frustrates me that I have no money on my verified exchanges right now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:35:50
non-pruning, the 1TB WD drive is hooked up to it via a linked directory and is externaly powered by the USB hub
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:39:25
TBH I don't know what you're all talking about, I started buying and using btc years ago, when I was 15, and I never had problems buying nor using them - i agree it was easier when localbitcoins was actually accessible in my country but I found other ways, people selling them on trade forums or now gdax.
I never had a single problem besides getting some sites to work as I was not old enough 2 years ago, 5 minutes of googling is all it really needs IMO 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:35:13
quick and easy explained, thank you!
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:03:14
samourai seems pretty popular and even has bech32 support, so I heard atleast
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:04:31
most of them: no, many: yes, strongly depends where you ask
@_date: 2018-05-04 18:22:49
in the usa, europe, asia, africa? see it all depends on the "where"
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:06:19
i really want to play but it seems the other guys dont want to.... no players....
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:30:19
NightFlash , couldnt play yet but design looks nice and clean from my PoV
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:18:44
so long that i regret some subs i did because of their value 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:33:27
You can already sub with btc you know that right?
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:16:47
can confirm, had 0,5 btc and didnt hodl, I now have 0,03 and hodl since 3k 
@_date: 2018-03-10 09:54:37
and that's also where I think OP is wrong, bitcoin gets defended - be it the developers defending the code/the obsolescence by updates, be it the network by the node count and and and - there are also a lot of people defending bitcoin in media so I don't really get his point ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:05:37
TBH I don't think so, but also I wouldn't care because it cost someone multiple thousands of dollars to do so and it won't have much sustainability for now.
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:34:51
you should consider using a different exchange then dude :/
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:57:38
Well, I'm 19 years old, only starting my apprenticeship this september. I may have a different mindset then a lot of you that have to pay for your kids, home, car etc. but damn, I don't care what the price is. If I can help my parents with a downpayment on our house in 3 years ( when I'm not longer an apprentice ) - HELL YEA, if not - I still have all my life in front of me and watching a revolution happening in front of me is more then enough moon for me.
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:11:02
Damn, that car wouldn't sell below 10k€ where I live.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:44:46
that sucks, where do you live? maybe there are other options, why not give bisq a try for example?
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:15:43
thank you very much, will look into this one tomorrow after work - seems to be the only reasonable one for Germany at the moment
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:36:23


That's literally what I have a fixed amount of satoshi specially reserved for - a good bottle of champagne from a local producer in case it hits 1 mil 
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:30:58
am 18 - would be ok with losing 3k to if i had 3k to begin with ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:39:54
if you're talking about SETI hey atleast you where doing something for a good cause - I do it aswell from time to time
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:02:18
that's the beauty of it ;)
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:21:34
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:46:08
what about localbitcoins? 0.00005 tx fee at the moment atleast a little bit better
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:11:23
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:18:14
lol they had a R version of that thing? we just sold our old normal V70 after it cost way to much to repair it :/
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:07:15
don't worry, everybody already started building it's own bridge and eventually everybody will arrive on the other side, it may take a while but in the end there will be many bridges so if one collapses it won't matter that much
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:34:00
it it hits 999,999 you can be certain it will hit 1,000,000 on any exchange a second after aswell because of the hype involved
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:12:03
wasn't my point, I totally agree with you.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:54:46
well i'm now aware of it too 
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:07:32
A ZR1 is def a nice car but dude, do you even know the e30 m3? It's not like any of that new crap they produce, that's good old german engineering.
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:23:27
Checked  to test if your port is still open?
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:18:07
Thanks man, this is the first time I see TXHighway and I must say it's funny AF because theres literally more then 10 cars on the BTC lane for every car on the BCH lanes. And that's without even acknowledging SegWit and the fact that we have Blocks that are effectively &gt; 1 MB :D 
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:26:51
one more reason not to buy one you say?
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:06:32
Yea but then they also won't care about how to get a transaction into a block :)
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:49:05
I guess so but still, why did we choose a lambo as that symbol and no a ferrari, bugatti, corvette, .....?
IMO owning a lambo is a kids dream but as you grow older you know there's better alternatives.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:57:50
his thesis is that once btc hits a high enough value and therefore a high enough marketcap you won't see those 50% swings in days, which is definitly a reasonable assumption in some way because it takes more money to "move" the market
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:58:00
And now they ask you: How do we find a route from A to B in this mesh of (insert a very high number) nodes within a reasonable amount of time?
I'm not trying to bash LN by the way, I love it, but can you explain that to a random guy on the street in a way he understands, I certainly can't?
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:50:02
if it's not my grandma , they've probably heard of it by now
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:13:14
I must vent something for once even if I'll probably get downvoted as hell, I don't get this whole lambo thing. I don't even like the car and I don't know why everybody does, besides that everyone here would hate me for owning a lambo. You know whats a really nice car? A bmw e30 m3 or, if we need to talk modern cars, a 911 gt3. F*ck Lambos man.
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:23:54
I hate the "one camp thought it could, the other thought it couldn't (scale onchain)" part because it basically puts his fork in the position of "we did what others thought was not possible" for anyone who has no idea about the whole debate.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:40:34
wow I never thought of that, is that actually something people are aware of?
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:08:53
I think Sido and Savas are both in a age where they stop caring about extra views so I'm totally with you on that. 
He's right it's cringy as fuck but who cares, look at the like/dislike ratio - that's for what is essentially a rap about crypto!
The message at the end by the way.....
