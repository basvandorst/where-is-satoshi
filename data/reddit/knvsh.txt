Electricity: The house I rent a part of sold last month, and my electricity is part of rent.  I was paid up through end of lease, and with all the construction and such around here these days, I figured I pull more electricity without paying more.  
Cost: As noted, the miner cost $2K. I cannot recall if it said "new" or not on the sale.  We know nobody gets a "new" miner these days, except the manufactures.  That being said, the rig (CoinCraft/LKETC) was strong and consistent.  I have no complaints about the machine.

Most of the questions and answers about mining profitability tend to be focused on short-term outlooks.  In the near-term, mining start-up at any hash rate is a loss.  However, there is value in small-scale mining if one looks longer-term:
(a) Average cost of a 1Th/s miner on ebay these days is $2000.*  At current difficulty, you'll get about 1.4BTC/mo with a 1Th/s miner.  Using a the below market exchange rate of $500/1BTC, and accounting for increasing difficulties, the miner would pay for itself in about 5 mo (sans electricity and management costs).  Everything thereafter is gravy, assuming the rig still functions well.
(b) Profitability correlates with BTC value, and therefore increases in BTC value translate into more ROI.  Imagine that when the current slump subsides,the exchange rate doubles to 1BTC/1000USD.  Now the miner is paid off in 2 months, and still generating income.  
(c) Mining is perhaps the best way to understand the technical aspects of Bitcoin.  As folks above noted, you can "mine to learn stuff," but it's difficult to learn some stuff without mining, without seeing how things work at the root level.  As bitcoin becomes more mainstream, those who understand the Bitcoin protocol and blockchain best will be highly sought partners, consultants, and representatives.  
There's other reasons to mine with a long-term outlook, but the above are particularly strong.  I wouldn't suggest small-scale mining with the hope of an immediate payoff; those days are over.  Longer-term, I think you'll profit if you're smart, technologically sophisticated, and don't buy an overpriced rig.    Those profits, however, are not likely to be from mining.  It's the knowledge and skills gained from mining that will be of most value.  
* There are a lot of overpriced miners on ebay.  Based on ebay acution sales, the market rate is about $2000 per Th. Don't pay more than that!

Campass, I DID take *potential* BTC value into account.  However, if someone is looking to mine, they cannot do so on a hope and a prayer about value increases.  Even budgeting at current rates is foolish.  At 0.029 BTC/day (current difficulty and 1 Th/s) a $1000 USD/BTC exchange equals $29/day.  As difficulty increases this income will decrease, so any sustainable BTC value increase will not likely cover costs of purchase and operations.  It's all chasing dragons, and you don't even get a buzz.

I don't think seed BTC is the problem.  If its a good game, you could get some supporters.  If just paying out Staoshis, it might be able to survive for a bit (no pun intended) without further deposits.  Longer term there would need to be a plan for the bank. Or not, perhaps; if the aim is get people interested in Bitcoin, then at some point the game will no longer be needed, so the bank may not need to be that large.  Of course there's always the possibility of charging for the app, perhaps simply as a way of funding the game payouts.

I'm not "against this" in terms of working to defeat it.  Part of me hopes its successful, but I simply don't think it will.  It's not something I would spend my time or money supporting.  It will likely be ineffective and certainly reinforces the corrupt system.  There's too many points of possible failure to the ultimate goal.  A better approach is to attack the problem at its root through such things as Democracy School's local control work, participatory budgeting, or any of the tens of other radical democratic projects out there.

Umm, who in the U.S. is not already aware of the influence of money on politics? Very few, I would estimate, and those who are not, are irrelevant to the political process in general.  Intentions are one thing, but the MayDay project's ideals do not match its actions.  If you want money out of politics, you don't actually put money into politics.  I know their argument is to get in to fix the problem, but we've heard that one before. This project seems to reflect much about America; looking for a quick fix to a systemic problem that can only be corrected over-time by cultural shifts.

When I first got serious about Bitcoin, I wished there was a "serious" (i.e., more than dice) way to have fun and get some coins.  It seemed to me then (and now) that, for example, playing Mario (I'm not a gamer at all so Mario may be a bit dated) and getting staoshi instead of points would be good way to get others to pay attention to Bitcoin.  I still think its a good idea.  They may already be out there, but I haven't come across any yet.  As for your "proposal," sounds like you need to put time into developing a concept and a beta version.  Then bring it to the community.

First, off, "the subject is currently too unstable" is not an argument against any research; actually it's the best argument for research!  This professor should be abandoned, if possible.  S/he is not going to be open to Bitcoin, or any new thinking.  If you want to learn something from the service you are purchasing, you need a different service provider.  All that being said, in an academic environment, your interests don't really matter.  Sad, but true.  The trick is to discover the adviser's interests and bend your project in that direction; without breaking it, of course.  So, for example, if you're stuck with professor-stay-safe, and you can/don't give in to his/her lack of curiosity, the paper can slant towards the topic of merchant adoption risk (um, near zero!).  In general, you'll get an adviser one-way-or-another, and can write about any damn topic you want (without bounds, of course).  Whether the adviser will be a facilitator or a opponent, ultimately depends on intersecting your goals with his/hers.  The academe is politics of the most brutal type, so play the game, or get off the field.  (I spent two decades in the university, and hold a Ph.D.)

Been having similar thoughts lately.   I'm working on related project that I hope to bring out of the shadows later this week.  
One of the things I've been thinking about about this subject is that Bitcoin offers an opportunity to do things differently in the research sphere in terms of research design, data collection, funding, and publication and presentations.   I'd encourage anyone with an interest in research peer review to read this article [We need a Github of science](  Somehow, someway, ideas therein should be adopted broadly by research communities.  Academia will have to pulled along kicking, screaming, and biting as their currency is citations, as well as the power to decide what is worthy of publication (which is "bought" via citations).  However, many academics are getting wise to a publishing racket that makes millions off of their (often publicly funded) work, while becoming increasingly irrelevant to publishing (i.e., desktop publishing and the web leave big academic publishers a vestigial tail we should cut off ASAP). (RIP Arron!)
As the preceding suggests, I'm on board with such a project, and perhaps already a few steps down the road.  Please post any news, or set up a hang-out to see what can be developed. If no one else dose, I'll eventually get around to it, but its not at the top of my TODO list.

There is nothing that says "Bitcoin" will be an author.  The fundraiser is for equipment that will be used for all sorts of papers.  The announcement states that with $5K "the community" will "get its name in the credits for the project."  This could mean anything, except maybe a by-line.  It makes no sense to call Bitcoin an author, any more than it does to call GW Bush a painter, or BHO a marksman.

Ditto  comment.  This might be an interesting essay, but I'd have been laughed out of my doctoral program if I formally proposed such a project for the dissertation.  Of course, perhaps there's information missing from the OP, but the two questions that immediately arise are: What is the research question?  I'm not one to follow the dictates of traditional academic research, which are often antithetical to useful knowledge, but an RQ will help define data sets, methodologies, and theoretical foundations.  Relatedly, what's the data for the investigation?  How will you show/demonstrate/support the claim posted above?  This absence of a clear line of sight from RQ to data collection will/should be cause for rejection of such a proposed project.  If this Reddit thread constitutes the apex of your data collection, I'd be weary of going any further thinking that the project will be defensible.  None of this is to say that a weak project cannot make it through a doctoral defense, as most of my peers work was sadly as pedestrian as this topic appears to be, and all programs are different.  What was communicated (although never said aloud) to me during my dissertation work was that technique trumps substance, and by "technique" is meant following tradition.  The OP text doesn't even allude to meeting minimal standards of those traditions.  (Apologies if this is blunt, but having learned these lessons the hard and expensive way, I'd rather hurt some feelings than allow someone to blindly walk into a position that ends with a tombstone labeled "ABD.")

That's not at all what extant data, nor everyday news, shows.  According to the [report]( mentioned in this article, all things considered, the "income-to-adoption" ratio is pretty even between the upper-income and lower-income survey respondents.  Those with lower-incomes, are just slightly more likely than those with higher-incomes to say they would consider using Bitcoins for purchases in the future.  In addition, wealthy individuals are purchasing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins, and millions of dollars worth in the aggregate.  Furthermore, many times over those amounts are being invested in Bitcoin-based businesses. If you can draw your gaze away from Bitcoin the currency, anyone who ignores Bitcoin (the technology) today is going to be living a very regretful existence in 5-10 years. That's what the wealthy and technologically intelligent investors are signaling, exactly the opposite of your assertion.

Might I suggest attaching that article, or some of your qualifications (by which I mean limitations of the data, not your degrees), to the database itself.  It's fairly easy for someone without the experience in, or knowledge of, high-quality research standards to accept as gospel anything with the words "academic" and "research" appended.  I'm looking at you, MSM. (Not that they're watching.)  Also easy for someone with that experience and knowledge to think the database creator did not consider those issues, when, in fact, he had.

You're unlikely to see substantive income (if any) from Bitcoin research generally. This is true for the tech side, and goes double for social science research.  If you've got more going for you than a masters degree in media studies (which is gonna generally be theoretically focused and lacks practical value [I have Ph.D. in Communication so I speak from experience.]) you may be able to leverage your knowledge work in Bitcoin as part of larger enterprise.  It simply is unlikely to be an income generator in its own right.  The Bitcoin sphere is a strange space fueled by hype.  It will go crazy over a "new" technology that makes big promises, lament when that venture goes south, and then repeat the cycle.  The lack of flash that is common with good research seems to bore most.  That being said, there's some space for consulting, if you've got a good technical background, as well as a unique perspective via media studies.  In general, however, its best to not expect a return on your investment in the near term.  
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:13:08
From the author of the study (me):  
At the risk of dampening the headline, but in the interest of accuracy, I want to note two points about the low-income adoption issue that didn't get into the Cointelegraph article.  
One, the numbers we're talking about here are fairly small, something like 5-7% differences between "higher-income likelihood of adoption" and lower-income rates.  
Two, with error rates hovering at 3-4% we could be talking about a virtually non-existent difference.  
As I wrote in the [report]( the income-to-adoption likelihood is an interesting data point that needs to be further investigated, not something I would forward as a firm conclusion.  The possibility of the relationship is what I found interesting, and something that seems worthy of closer attention.
