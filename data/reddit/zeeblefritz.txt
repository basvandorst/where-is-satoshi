Tell that to the global economy that has multiple forms of money and currency and has for thousands of years.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:02:34
Please tell me more about why you can’t have silver and gold and also copper as money? Given the value of gold today and considering it’s hard to buy anything less than $50 worth at a time 1g silver offers a perfect solution to smaller purchases. Please convince me I’m wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:34:11
They did the same to me. Downright refused to tell me why they closed my account and they had to call corporate for approval to give me my money. This was way back in 2014
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:03:00
If you can’t convince me here or even try why should I read this book? I have read The creature from Jekyll island and my opinion is anything that isn’t debt is good sound money.

My comment wasn't about bitcoin it was about silver and gold. You said you can't have both as money. For digital currencies it's honestly hard to say at this point which will prevail. But I believe gold and silver are still the best real money we have.

I can only hope that this meeting has guided bitcoin and all other crypto currecies into an existience with government control to a new future of regulation and freedom. That is that is a thing.

Any links to how to get started as a part of one of these nets? Maybe?

What about a shutdown of the internet? Wouldn't that be more effective that round up of gold?
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:17:47
Not with Chase. I have been auto denied from any Chase or Bank of America managed credit cards for 6 years. I have 3 credit union accounts now.

@_date: 2019-11-08 19:34:05
Thanks. It really made me appreciate crypto more. Worst part about it was they weren’t sure if they could give me my money when I went to the branch to discuss. I was like what? Seriously? Then they called corporate and released my money. At this time I was unemployed and desperately needed money and a bank. Fuck Chase long live BTC
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:24:39
Fuck this guy
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:25:06
This reminds me of when Chase closed my account in 2013 and refused to tell me why. Then I couldn’t get a bank account for several years. Only thing I could think that caused this was I had bought and sold bitcoin on Coinbase. Glad that is all over now.
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:08:08
I think nobody has any more cash to spend after chasing this beast for so long
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:55:23
as someone who sold out in 2013 and bought back in and takes a look at what could have been I'm gonna keep Hodling and accumulating. 
Hint: I could have literally been a millionaire.

To be honest I hate mobile keyboards so I don’t give a shit when I am typing as it takes three extra keypresses to get the punctuation.
Because it makes you anxious I will fix for you.

Comment of the day really
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:17:11
yeah I was holding a small amount and wanted to trade for something else last night. I knew about the long times and high fees but blanked after finally recovering my wallet from a backup into a mobile wallet. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:41:22
Y’all get so scared. This tells me a couple of things. You’re new to the investing game, new to bitcoin, you’re not diversified or possibly all of the above. When I first started I was up constantly due to price alarms. Now I take a weekly tally, possibly rebalance or place a new order and that’s it. If you aren’t in this for the long game you should go to Vegas and put it all on black. You will get similar results.

is it viabtc? they are backlogged.

I'm guessing the same amount of people that use the original bitcoin code today.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:02:35
yeah looks like i have to pay a crap load of money to make it happen. 
probably more than I will make

Pretty sure Netscape was the precursor to Firefox right?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:12:31
oof I did it exactly at 5pm cst and no go. i guess keep trying. have you used btcspeedy before. they are only asking $10
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:57:12
I emailed them today. Hopefully find out soon. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:40:39
Yup. I'm not buying PUBG for this very reason. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:37:21
Looks like they responded with nearly identical text of the original email. What a cop out. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:49:45
Also your definition of money does not prohibit by definition gold and silver from being money. In fact, your definition even mentions coins which historically were made of gold and silver. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:15:23
Mmm, that's good satire
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:14:09
The exchange was btc-e. Somehow they accessed both my gmail and my btc-e accounts. Which both had different passwords. I believe they were targeting me specifically somehow as both of my btc-e accounts were accessed. Unfortunately they only stole from the account with a lot of funds.
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:38:11
Are you dense or just stupid. Gold and silver are money.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:43:35
Just high transaction fees. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 06:32:05
Either I changed the password fast enough or is wasn't what they were looking for
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:48:28
Furthermore. " Commodity money is created from a good, often a [precious metal]( such as [gold]( or [silver]( which has uses other than as a [medium of exchange]( (such a good is called a [commodity]( " from the wikipedia article [ about your beloved fiat money. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:47:30
No but at least I would know an approximate description of who they were. I know absolutely nothing of my assailant
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:43:25
I'm gonna go ahead and stick with our countries original definition.  The **Coinage Act** or the **Mint Act**, passed by the [United States Congress]( on April 2, 1792, created the [United States dollar]( as the country's standard unit of money, established the [United States Mint]( and regulated the coinage of the United States.[\[1\]]( The long title of the legislation is *An act establishing a mint, and regulating the Coins of the United States*. This act established the silver [dollar]( as the unit of money in the United States, declared it to be [lawful tender]( and created a [decimal]( system for U.S. currency.  [  Yes the gold and silver have been illegally stripped from our current supply of money but it still stands that it is in fact money. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:17:56
I did not.
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:14:52
Yeah and I may just be done with Bitcoin for a while
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:48:01

I guess no one knows how to submit a claim then?
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:29:45
Says who? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:06:39
I mean aren't the coins allocated to individual accounts? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:34:04
Yeah and that's only cool when regulated banks do it. :(
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:00:53
wondering the same thing. Only thing I remember is I withdrew half of the value in btc of my account but it was all altcoins so how am i supposed to know? if I claim something that isn't true and they prove it then they had the records all along so WTF
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:41:10
So basically anyone who had money in the exchange is fucked?

I recently started trading on btc-e and it has much lower fees 3 times cheaper than Gox and a great trollbox as well as alts 
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:41:01

@_date: 2013-11-07 08:06:30
looks about right.
@_date: 2013-10-11 05:48:01
Fastest and easiest. I used Gox to buy most of them but don't trust them for withdrawal.
