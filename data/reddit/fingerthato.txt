BITCOIN ALLOWS YOUR KIDS TO BUY DRUGS ON THE DEEPWEB.

I,too, must know. I tested sending $16 to my bank account before sending a big amount. It's taken over a week and nothing. Does quantity affect how fast the transaction is?

I got into binance for ripple.

I'm in it to topple the banking system. And moon
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:26:36
Why is this awesome? Sorry. I'm noob. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:00:02
For those who want quick summary. You just need $12 k dollars. Buy script miners. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:18:47
17 bitcoins is def something you should keep in an offline wallet. Sorry bud. It's almost plastered everywhere. Do not keep large quantities in an exchange.

Doesn't microcenter have 2 limit per household policy?
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:59:33
Either choose another coin or wait till bitcoin lightning. Transaction fees are not worth it at the moment. Unless you are a miner, then god bless those fees.

Except are eye bags from watching the market prices. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:36:55
Why didnt you rebuy when it started to grow again, perhaps like at $14000 or even $1500? Why did you wait till its back to back to the price you sold?

$20. I came late to the party.
Decided to invest $200 in bitcoin and then invest in equipement to mine alt coins. I'm still early for the mining phase. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:44:35
Or maybe I'm waiting till it becomes cheaper to buy more? I bought at a high price. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:01:33
I'm waiting for that &lt;13k. I doubt it'll get lower than 12 k. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:31:14
Tople the banking system!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:54:59
So is worshiping the dollar. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:05:46
I bought at $16k increasing to 18k and sold before $16k dip. I bought double at $12k dip, and now I have more than if I held at 16k and bought at 12 k. Risky move but ended with +$400 in gains up to this hour. But now it's hodl 4 life. All I needed was a good dip. Merry xmas to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:23
Because if I sell now, i can invest what i originially invested in when its much lower. Again, I didn't have much invested, if it became cheaper I would invest double.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:38:04
Bicoin cash just sounds like a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:15:45
Or because I know I can have better risks somewhere else? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:52:46
I'm hoping it does so I can invest in it more. I still believe in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:13:39
Never? Seems unprobablistic. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:02:30
Because I bought at a high price. Pointless for me to lose money, if I can sell it at the price I bought it, and rebuy when its cheaper. I would make more gains
For those who bought it under $10k. Should def not sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:30
He said to avoid fees. Really, you can't read?

Especially the younger they get. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:36:41
I've made some loss. Do I add the loss up too? 
Example coin A. I gain $100 usd in investments, and coin B I lose $40. Would my capital gains be $40. 
Also what about fees? What about exchanges like coin base to binance, high $100 - $16 transaction fees puts me at $80. I assume btc to btc is not taxable?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:23:31
Ummm.... what?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:04:39
I was up +$60 2 days ago. Selling today I am +$0, as if I never invested at all. If it drops anymore, I would be in negatives and I would have to wait till it goes up again to break even again. If I wait for the price to go down, I don't lose money a long the way, and invest again once its cheap to make more gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:35:36
Million dollar decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:18:28
Damn. i forgot about taxes. I am fucked.

@_date: 2017-12-20 22:22:59
