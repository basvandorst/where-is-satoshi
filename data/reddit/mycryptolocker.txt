This does not comes as a surprise , although its sad and people will have to find alternate means now to dabble in cryptos... Modi and his stooges have already sold India and its 1.3 billion plus people to the powers that be. Demonetization on behalf of Digital cash alliance and Washington, Attempts at usurping gold through the gold monetization scheme.  Insane obsession with Aadhar implementation at all cost and focus on cashless economy . And now this ban on RBI regulated entities on dealing with cryptos while at the same time having the balls to tell to the people they are not against blockchain technology and will be coming up with its own centralized version " it will be named laxmi" of crypto currency due to the benefits of tracking spends and avoiding printing and logistics costs ... No body should have any illusion that India is a free/ democratic country .. We are all being controlled and their grip on our lives is getting more tighter each passing day. The sad thing is not many people comprehend it and are blissfully oblivious !!
