Because he realized he doesn't have the capability to recognize if something is a scam or not so he decided just not to participate at all.

Most of those 'investors' being affected are thieves who have benefited from years of excessive compound interest and are responsible for freezing up the economy.

The more people that we can sell our bitcoins too at high prices the better.
I'm all for this development.

Winklevoss twins took 1% of their facebook lawsuit proceeds and bought 100,000 of bitcoin when it was $10.
They are up 60 fold on their 'investment' while taking zero risk.
The majority of bagholders on here take 100% risk while seeing little if any gains.

Oh please.
Bitfinex announces suspension then price craters. Yes the 2 events in you mind are not related?

Under 100.
People are waking up to some inconvenient truths.
Bitcoin is primarily owned by the earlyadopters/founders this means a ton of hoarded coins are kept off live markets allowing the price to be easily BID UP.

Keep repeating myths. Child mortality was higher which brought the average life span down.

Warning signs about Finex have been out in the open especially since they use a hacked version of bitcoinica software.
When will this greedy and dumb community learn ?

Satoshi alone is up to 1.5mil coins.
Ver + Winklivii are another 200,000
So 3 people own almost 20% of sell-able supply. 
Bitcoin ownership distribution resembles a penny stock pump and dump.

American's are fond of rebellion and revolution(do to their shitty history) while being the most servile and mechanical civilization that has ever existed.

Why do people on here celebrate Uber for driving wages down to near slavery by flooding the market with broke idiots pretending to be taxi drivers?
Uber skims off the surplus value created by drivers. The same way bitcoiners expect developers to work for free to boost the value of their coins.
The 'tech' industry is absolutely disgusting.
