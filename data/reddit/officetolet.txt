BTC IS a currency - it’s just not a “legitimate” one that they recognise and likely never will be

Government adoption goes against BTC core principles because governments seek to control everything and manipulate to their own benefit - and I don’t mean the benefit of their people 
Who gives a fuck if the government adopts it? 
BTC is an uncontrollable currency created by crypto-anarchists and if someone figures a way to do it, we’ll switch to a new coin and another and another and another 
Crypto will end government financial control in the long run... OR it’ll end up controlling us entirely e.g  no cash, chip in your hand linked to a gov.{you} blockchain that records EVERYTHING you ever do and purchase... 
Could go either way tbf ��

It’s like 2141 that the last one will be found... 
The reward halves every four years. Started at 50 BTC per block created, dropped to 25 and currently I believe it’s at 12.5. Next it’ll drop to 6.25 and it keeps going for 100+ years

You think gold was a “currency” in the modern day sense of the word? Would’ve been a nightmare �� 
BTC is a currency but it’s still in its infancy. It needs to go through this asset phase and once it’s more widely spread, the price with stabilise and it’ll start being traded as an actual currency

I pay taxes  Not sure why your point is tbf

I believe that in its current format, BTC **isn’t** a “currency”, it’s an asset whose value can change rapidly
But it won’t always be like that and once it’s stabilised, it’ll be able to be used as a currency again

“A currency (from Middle English: curraunt, "in circulation", from Latin: currens, -entis), in the most specific use of the word, refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange”
It IS a currency because you can buy things with it. It’s just not massively effective at the moment due to price swings but there’s been many real world example of government backed currencies inflating to point where they’re worthless but they had no way to come back from it. Hopefully BTC does but if not, there’s a thousand other cryptos to trade in as means of barter and BTC can stay as an asset 
It’s deviated from Satoshis plan already so who knows at this point, it’s all speculation

See... I’ve started to flip in the opposite direction now and become concerned about the price rise
Now don’t get me wrong, I’m a massive fan of BTC and it’s capabilities in the long term so still invested obviously  
But recently there’s been a few things that have raised my suspicions... 
- colleagues and others buying in without having a clue what it is but simply because they’ve seen the news that it’s increasing. Supply and demand is artificially inflating the price of a piece of tech that just isn’t read for mainstream adoption... or worth 10k right now imo 
- the whole BitcoinCash political bullshit atm. Realistically, the “owners” of Cash are also heavily invested in BTC (likely still continually buying) and could easily rip their cash out causing huge panic and a price crash - which would also give a poor reflection of the BTC brand 
- rumours flying round the last few weeks that it was Cash owners spamming the network with transactions that led to the 100k mem pool build up also plays into potential attacks on the network - unlikely to be their only play 
I don’t know if it’ll happen anytime soon but the bubble it’s recently got into is gonna pop at some point �� 
Really curious to hear other people’s thoughts though and I could be way off but I trust my instincts and at the moment they’re saying be cautious and ready for anything

Expand how? 
Lightening network removes the best parts of Bitcoin and replaces them with central hubs that need to be kept financially topped up - who can afford to do that at a decent level except the current financial sector and governments? 
Peer to peer will be blacklisted and fear mongered against much like the dark web so the majority of users will use a controlled and regulated version of it - which, again like the internet, is highly monitored
@_date: 2019-12-14 00:45:12
You make a good point about us still being able to use it underneath the LN layer but what if that becomes illegal? Would only take a minor law change to make every transaction through a “verified” hub the only legal means of transacting - would you still do it knowing every transaction it’s highly traçable back to you? 
All of a sudden we don’t have cash anymore (in some future crypto world) for anon transactions and every single thing we do is tagged to us - likely through fingerprint/retina security etc
Governments like control over their population and anything that gives them freedom from that control needs to go asap
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:50:34
Bitcoin is better than money until it’s usurped and sitting beneath a top layer network that’s controlled by banking hubs... oh wait, that’s happening as we speak... awkward

An EMP couldn’t stop Bitcoin (or any other crypto) because the network is spread across the globe and the pulse of an EMP is localised to the blast radius - you’d have to EMP the entire planet

I don’t think you understand how crypto networks function...

It’s not a threat... it’s the future of control
What was meant to be an anon coin for peer to peer transactions has been taken over by financial companies and is being usurped to gain full control over our finances. It’ll be the end of cash and the beginning of “don’t do as you’re told, don’t feed your family”
