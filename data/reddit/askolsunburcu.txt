I'm aware he was just joking around. Still cool though.

Here's the [AMA]( if anyone's interested.

Nope, I'm in Turkey.

Thanks, I appreciate your help.

I think I've got it, thanks!

OK so I click Deposit, then there are tabs on the left hand side that read:
* Deposit
* EU bank (SEPA)
* International bank
* Bitcoin
* Bitstamp code
* BitInstant
Since I want to transfer money from my international bank account I'm assuming I click the "International bank" tab. What I see is: First name, last name, amount, currency, comment (optional) and a Deposit button. So if I type in the amount I want to transfer, the money will automatically be taken from my international bank account (which I already set up) and transfered into my Wallet in BTC?

Wait. By message field do you mean the "Comment (optional)" section? What exactly do I type in there?

I don't want to do something wrong and lose my money in the process. That's why I asked for step by step instructions, so I don't mess up.

I will check this out. Thanks.
Are you familiar with Bitstamp at all? Since I already set up my bank info there I figure it would be easier if I did this thru Bitstamp. I'm trying to find out exactly what I need to do on there so I can get this show on the road already.
Edit: Hmm BitcoinNordic appears to be expensive. 15.73 Euro to 1 BTC, when 1 BTC is worth 13.54 Euro right now.
