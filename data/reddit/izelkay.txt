This had nothing to do with scaling issues and everything to do with the fact that the few public nodes available on the light wallet were overloaded by the sudden surge of transactions when IOTA exploded in popularity. No one was making use of the plethora of other nodes because it's not obvious how to do that due to the current wallet not being user friendly. Nonetheless, most of those issues have been fixed now.

No, alts are nowhere near the level they were prefork. That money is going into BCH.

Not quite. Alts started dumping and Bitcoin started pumping before the Gold fork. With the S2X fork near on the horizon, many people did not sell back into alts after the Gold fork and continued holding Bitcoin until after the S2X fork. For this reason I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin back in the $6000 levels that it was in pre-Gold fork.

Use Gemini instead.  I had the same issues with Coinbase.

Wait a couple more hours or another day, they should show up. If not, contact support.

Gemini is not a scam, I use it all the time. The reason OP's Bitcoins are on hold is because he initiated an ACH bank transfer to buy them, and his funds were simply pre-credited. Now he has to wait for his funds to actually clear (~7 days) before he can move any bitcoin off the exchange. 
This was all explained in the their FAQs, which OP obviously didn't bother reading.

To answer your first question: yes.

I signed up last Saturday and they finished verifying my identity on Wednesday. Honestly I think I just got lucky with how quick mine was, because Coinbase didn't work out for me.
