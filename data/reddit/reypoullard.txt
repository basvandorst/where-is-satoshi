Love how bitcoin and cryptocurrencies facilitate open borders and bring to bear some very uncomfortable questions about sovereignty. As govs portend, there will be a direct relationship between mass adoption of crypto and encroachment of personal liberty. This slime mold is a perfect strategy which humans could neutralize this threat by  eliminating blind tribalism and decentralizing migration. IMO, country agnostic, tech-savvy pioneers will be the ones that lead the effort...and reap the biggest rewards.

1) Your experience is subjective; and 2) my point was straightforward: that there are 40MM Americans who could possibly benefit from her example if they so choose.

Good lesson that early adopters can share with the rest of the 40 MILLION Americans that are unbanked.
