If servers were paid right in the first place, we wouldn't have to tip them. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:10:13
I always tip cash just because it's easier, but that 3% fee will be there regardless. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:01:17
I am, but not because I write checks!

Do you mine your doge? Is it profitable?

Is there any way we could see a way to prevent password changes happening so fast? An opt-in feature where it takes a week or so to actually take effect? Maybe provide bank account details, or date of last buy/sell as "proof of ownership" somehow?
I don't know, some kind of delay at least would be something I'd opt into.

Just a heads up, I'm getting a 404 from mobile.

Rent and electricity. I also buy crows and candles, but my provider takes debit.

I wanted to say this is legit, I just got my BTC. But I'm having problems getting setup. Sent an email to them (contact regarding my issues. Hoping to try this browser out!
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:13:22
Thanks! I'll look a little deeper. With my bitcoin boat barely afloat, I need to diversify.

The owner pays 3% of meal+tip (subtotal) to the credit card company. The price of the food should be enough to cover the 3% the owner pays.

I'm not angry. Just intolerant of trolls. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:18:32
It got a chuckle out of me. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:53:08
Why would you sell? You only lose when you sell. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:05:49
Aww man, sorry to hear that. It's down to $706 on Coinbase over here. 
Hope you get what you're looking for!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:48:54
You and I are in the same boat. Let's hope we are able to jump in on this!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:41:09
You don't?

Hold. Seriously.
Fluctuation is natural.

Sucks for those of us trying to buy. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:41:13
Thanks man, cheers. Here's hoping this week wasn't a total waste. 
The problem? I'm too good at my job. She'll never be back in. Technician's Touch is more of a curse than a blessing. I know how Midas felt.

Can I tell a non BTC sob story?
Alright, so I work at my university's Technology store as their technician. I fix fap boxes for freaky folks, and save damsels in distress from damnable dilemmas. 
On Monday it was, in walks this *beautiful* girl. Just my type. Not the first time I've seen her... But first time she's really caught my eye. The power port on her pc has been pushed in. Deep. I was worried I might have to solder the connection back, and I didn't have my iron (I provide my own. Broke ass store, but I love my co-workers) on me. Told her there was no guarantee for a fix. "I'll have to talk to my dad about it." She leaves. 
Tuesday, she comes back. "My dad wanted me to try Best Buy, but... I trust you." I never felt so good. Told her I'd try my best. She leaves, I open that S.O.B pc up, and don't have to solder anything. I'm gonna ask this girl out. Slip her my number, be smooth. I fix her computer and call her up. "I'll be in tomorrow! You're a miracle worker!"
Shit. Wednesday is my short day. I usually work an hour shift. Damn, damn, damn. I go into work, hoping to see her... A half-hour goes by and I get an email. My next class is cancelled! I can stay another hour! Uplifted, I wait patiently... Time marches on... She doesn't show. It's about 5 minutes to my next class, so I absolutely HAVE to run... I leave, sit in my class... Get a text from my co worker... I missed her by 2 minutes. 120 seconds. I'll never know if she would even reject me. Feels bad man. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:24:06
Only if you don't mention that you're a minor. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:42:04
A phoenix. It's falling now, but it will rise again. Kinda self explanatory.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:38:03
If it goes twice, next one's on me. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:33:23
Go fuck yourself. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:10:29
You don't lose until you sell at a loss. Hang in there buddy!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:16:39
It's one of the very few ways to get BTC without a bank account. I am not vouching for it, only stating that it is an option. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:21:22
I thought 666 was a good buy, now it's bouncing up. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:48:13
It would be potentially profitable. Any investment is a risk. Don't dump in more than you're willing to lose. It could crash to zero tomorrow. It could double. 
I bought today. I dumped the $40 my Credit Union gives me for using my card. We'll see!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:47:14
It's a Legend of Zelda game from 2000 available on the N64. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:55:44
Haha, I like it. It's subtly racist. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:50:48
I felt the same way right before bitcoin hit $1000. You could run out and get a visa giftcard, and use that site, Gift card drainer. (
I haven't used it personally, but have heard good things. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:44:32
In my opinion, if you (and you alone) don't hold your private keys, you don't have any bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:23:31
back up to 800
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:47:05
Went through this time, cheers!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:32:23
I want to panic BUY. I feel awful. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:50:22
It's actually my favorite Zelda game. Also number 2 on my "All Time Best Games" list. 
It's a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time. Follows the story of Young Link. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:33:37
Well... That's a thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:40:36
It's like Majora's Mask!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:47:10
that's what *she* said!
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:45:01
I bought at $745 today. Oops. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:45:04
You can't take the sky from me.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:45:56
I'm trying! I want to dump about $50 in. 
Coinbase is being a bitch. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:27:19
Well, I personally have yet to buy. I however, have an account at  tied to my bank account. It took a couple days. I was trying to buy with all the hype pre $1000, but missed the boat by a day.
You give them your bank, account number, and routing number. They make two deposits into your account, you tell them what the dollar values are, they withdraw the sum... And you're verified! It can take a day or two though.
