While tipping is good, there's one thing that an average bitcoiner can do to stimulate bitcoin's growth - Understanding it more and discussing it with people, whether online or offline.
You don't need to be technical to understand the basic operating principals and benefits of some important bitcoin protocol features such as multi-sig, irreversibility, as well as keeping up with recent developments (BIP38, transparent exchange and many others).
By being calm, knowledgeable and informed, people are far less likely to view you as a fanatic and participant of a 'ponzi scheme'. You really don't need to be technical or own a business to help bitcoin grow.
Anyway, keep hoarding/tipping/spending and carry on.

Here's from my limited understanding:
You have a seed which you can derive addresses one by one, deterministically. 
When you put the seed into electrum for the first time it'll generate say, 5 addresses, and check their activity. If any of them have been used (in the past), it'll generate more and check their history too, and if those have been used before it'll keep going. This process repeats until it has found *n* unused addresses that are without history. 
So in your case you don't need to worry as it should keep generating addresses until it finds your 51th (since you've used the previous 50)
You can increase *n* to larger numbers if needed.

As a long time dota player/spectator/community member, here are my thoughts on how we could make this work:
Do significant monetizing so that the event is sustainable (and we can run quite a few). Do something unique such that spectators will be willing to watch the tournament. If possible, have the price pool be in bitcoins, which will be the most direct advertisement. I'm happy you choose to partner with the GD guys since they're great figures in the community and will bring excellent exposure.
My hopes is that if we choose to do this, we should make it a sustainable advertisement which will have a recurring impact, instead of a one-time boom that will probably be a waste of time and money.
Of course, if I have the choice, I'll put the money towards open source bitcoin infrastructure in the form of bounties (which is quite lacking afaik), since only that will bring sustainable, true adoption.

Nice to see an idea I had a while ago become :)
Entering the amount to pay is a little bit tedious. I'm wondering whether there's a common NFC protocol for communicating bitcoin payment? (recipents + amount). That way it'll be really easy to get payments going on POS.
1.  tap phone -&gt; POS, get transaction details
2. review transaction details
3. enter pw, then tap HeliosCard
4. Done
Keep up the good work!

To me, Bitcoin is ultimately a currency that doesn't lose its value over time. Think the USD you use today but doesn't depreciate over time.
The most important thing for bitcoin is that it gets used as a transfer of value, because a currency gains value with every new user.
Merchant adoption is key to bitcoins growth. Merchants have incentive to accept bitcoin right now because
1. They get extra customers they otherwise wouldn't get, just because they accept bitcoin
2. They have the option to immeidately convert that into fiat, with minimal fees
3. Relatively easy to implement compared with other payment methods
Once more merchants are accepting bitcoin, the effect of No.1 will decrease, but as more merchants are accepting bitcoin, their upstream providers will be too. When you can "complete the loop" with bitcoin, it will likely outperform existing payment options in terms of fees, safety, value-over-time and processing time.
Ultimately that's where I hope bitcoin will be in the near future, and hence why merchant adoption is important right now.

Great article. Blockchain technology can be used in many industries similar to these, where authenticity and traceability is needed.
@_date: 2014-03-10 09:52:02
I have always considered bitcoin as a grassroot movement. We are a tiny fraction of the population, and then only a fraction cares about the success of bitcoin protocol itself. In this situation, we shoud try and avoid directly fighting the existing powers and paradigms, but instead develop something that is better, one bit at a time.
While merchant adoption and publicity is growing, there is one thing that bitcoin (and other crytpocurrencies) desperately needs: Competent developers with a security focus.
bitcoin service/infrastructure is a couple of orders harder to develop correctly, and poses severe risks if developers fail to do so.
There is little financial gain when people hack websites or programmes. With bitcoin, a hacker will only need one successful attack and he can retire, with little fear of being caught. Trust me, It WILL attract the best hackers in the world, and we need to be prepared for them. Think of the amount of bitcoin startups that are attacked, compared with startups in other areas. Are bitcoin startups really that incompetant? Maybe, but I more inclined to believe that it's becauses there are 100x or even 1000x more attempts at hacking.
What makes things harder is, instead of "I'll hack this idea together in a week and open for business" developers, we need people that are willing to do things methodically, think the system through, and implement them correctly, even if it means it takes much more time. And those people are hard to find.
So if you're a bitcoiner in IT (or heading that direction), I urge you to join in and start educating yourself in cryptography, secure software and other related fields. Start developing in the mindset of doing it 'right' and securely, instead of getting it to just 'work'.
There are tons of opportunities in bitcoin land, and it'll be a good day when people will actually be shocked by news of any bitcoin-related hacks.
@_date: 2014-01-01 07:55:52
Apart from wild price prediction (atm I think 20k+ is possible, but zero is likely too), I really hope that decentralized bitcoin trading can gain a lot of ground. This will require some new implementations and a lot of development, but it is the best thing we could do to secure bitcoin's future.
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:49:54
I don't think we need to specifically reduce our efforts in spreading bitcoin. True adoption will only follow how developed the infrastructure is. (Imagine how many merchants will be accepting btc if companies like bitpay didn't exist)
More developers is always good though
@_date: 2014-03-16 10:50:12
First, financial gain doesn't just come from increased bitcoin prices. Saving transaction fees in international transfers/purchases, being able to sell things without chargebacks and safe from government confiscation/bank runs are valid reasons why people would adopt bitcoin.
Developers are rewarded for being part of the largest social experiment ever that is on its way to change the world. Entrepreneurs see business opportunities in it. Purists sees it as a way to improve humanity's general condition.
Most of the above describes how I feel about bitcoin.

First you'll want to familiarize yourself with bitcoin basics (private/public key, the blockchain, how mining works, basic cryptography such as properties of hash functions etc)
Once you have a good grasp of bitcoin, you have two major directions you could study more in:
* Economics/Politic influence of a decentralized, deflationary currency.
* Technology behind bitcoin: bitcoin protocol, implementations, advanced cryptography etc etc.
With the first you're looking at becoming involved in the commerce sector in the coming age of cryptocurrencies. With the other, you're looking at developing the cryptocurrency ecosystem via programming etc.
There's no reason to not do both at the same time, but I would recommend learning more about the technology of bitcoins because even economists today cannot draw conclusions as to how a deflationary currency will work. In the unfortunate event that bitcoin (and the whole idea of cryptocurrencies) goes bust,
you don't lose your time investment since the ability to program and understanding of cryptography will be very useful.
Good luck

You'd think so, until this happens to you:

Would you pay a slight premium to be able to transfer bitcoins offline? If you say yes, then there's profit for any institution or agency to setup something like a bitcoin bank and issue hard-to-counterfeit notes.
The process is simple:
* You pay them 1.01 BTC to get a 1 BTC note from them
* You give it to Joe as to purchase something, offline
* Joe takes it to the bitcoin bank and asks for the bitcoin to be transferred to a particular address. They take the note and destroy it.
* Now Joe's bitcoin address have +1 BTC. Everyone is happy.
By using cryptography (+ salting), one can only counterfeit (copy) notes they have, and it is extremely easy to check whether a note are legit by just entering it into a checking algorithm.

It's probably not worth mining now unless you already have an ASIC, or unless you believe that 1BTC will skyrocket to $10k+ each.
The local dealer is probably a scam. Currently the only confirmed working ASICs are from Avalon. Don't believe in anything until you see the real thing working in person. ($1200 is way too cheap btw)

Your location will have a big impact on the budget. Things like MSB license in the US requires quite a lot of money.
In terms of labour cost, I estimate a bare minimum of 5 professionals * 6 months to have a somewhat complete exchange software developed. 
To develop a proper exchange that doesn't get hacked every other month is very hard and you'll need real professionals. (See bitcoin history and count the hacks)

@_date: 2013-04-30 05:57:04
1: Personally I think it is still too premature to take up bitcoin as the official currency for any country. To address the issue lack of internet access here are some possible solution:
* Very cheap electronic wallets where the bitcoin service is free (or like credit card, where you don't even need power source on the wallet)
* Paper bitcoins that are published by a company or institution, redeemable only in person/through an ATM. This will require anti-conterfeiting measures on the notes.
2: Bitcoin will probably not survive a major economic collapse because not enough people know about it yet. However minor economic crisis will definitely help the bitcoin economy to grow.
Bitcoin has a much much lower running cost than traditional fiat systems. From what I can think of, as soon as someone setup a publicly available satellite (and ground station that runs off free electricity like solar) for internet access, bitcoin will become much stronger than traditional fiat system in the face of calamities.

This isn't about me and how much I gained financially. It's about being part of a brighter future for everyone, in terms of financial security and efficiency. (Everytime I see a comment where people talk about how much they've earned from buying low and selling high, I feel really sad because to them bitcoin is just something they can take advantage of. There is no passion to build a better future)
With widespread adoption comes price stability. Yes bitcoin is a deflationary currency which means overtime the price of goods will decrease (in numbers), but at a very slow rate. (just like how slow the inflation is in our current economy)
Today you buy a bread with 1 BTC, but tomorrow you can buy it with 0.99999. Does that make a difference? Not really.
What I wish bitcoin can achieve is to encourage mindset of environmental sustainability. Because of the deflationary nature, people will opt for products that are more durable, instead of products that are cheap. (However if deflation is barely noticable then this probably won't happen)

It's really dumb to automatically invalidate anyone's argument just because they have been outright wrong before. 
I take Krugman's predictions and view on bitcoin with a grain of salt mainly because his arguments are illogical and biased. His bad journalism really makes it hard to take his words seriously, either in 1998 or 2013.
It is very clear from his quote here he really doesn't know what he is talking about. He didn't even get Metcalfe's law right (Metcalfe's Law: "The value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system")

Well the problem with minimum fee is that you have to constantly adjust it according to the value of bitcoin. (or the average volume they are traded at)

However an in-game currency could be pegged to bitcoin, and the total in-game currency is limited by how much bitcoin has been put into the system. (the in game currency will need to be infinitely divisable too)
Example: **1 BTC = 10 million gold**. The company starts the game by putting 10000 BTC worth of gold into the system.
By killing monsters, you are rewarded with a tiny amount of gold (say, 1 gold per monster kill, and it scales down as player number increases. This is representative of the difficulty increase in hashing for bitcoin mining)
As players purchase in game gold (by giving money to the company) the WoW gold limit increases accordingly, and vice versa when players cash out. The company will be gaining money from difference in transfer rates. (1BTC = 10 million gold IN, and 15 million gold = 1BTC out)
Obviously the game needs to be incredibly complicated to prevent any botting. The real financial gain/losses would result in greater involvement from players (probably a negative thing lol)
*but the possibilities!*

I think the world is not ready for bitcoin ATM yet. Bitcoin isn't even standing firm in the internet realm, and by growing way toofast into the physical realm will only hurt it.
We need to establish bitcoin as the dominant currency on internet first, before we attempt something that will burn us hard if failed.

Or split then encrypt the private keys of the address and issue them to people who are elected.
This could work for small community projects (require 3/5 trustees for example to move a fund) to big national funds (50/75 senators)
Basically like a democracy system.

Probably back-from-the-future analysis. But then that wouldn't be secure either cuz you'll be changing the future.
Best analysis is to understand how bitcoin work, and use it as a currency. Day trading is a dangerous game..

Yes, the first step of mainstream adoption is through providing software/virtual services at a very high discount (I'm talking at least 30%).
Example would be independent artists. Although it may feel like they're selling at a loss, by encouraging people to use bitcoins they are increasing the value of the bitcoins they hold. (More uses = more values)

Centralised note issued by a government or institution. Each note has a unique ID using proprietary identification system.
This is a 'promise' for the amount of bitcoin you can get by exchanging these coins/paper money.
To exchange into real bitcoins (publish onto the network) you'll need to go to one of their branches and hand it to a clerk or ATM. They will destroy the notes after the bitcoins are transferred.
In rural areas where there are no internet, you can essentially exchange bitcoins by exchanging these notes. This is just like when USD was first introduced as a 'promise' for an amount of gold.
However by the advancement of technology I don't think we'll be doing this. All we really need is satellites and solar powered apertures to get internet access virtually anywhere in the world. (and who knows where technology could bring us?)

Bitcoin is a team effort. Why? Because it's a currency for the future, not a commodity for personal gains.
We should be working as a team to improve the infrastructure - be it better exchanges, services or other innovations.
At the end of the day, it is NOT about how much USD bitcoin is worth. It's about how **bitcoin can advance our society to the next level by offering a truly uncontrolled and global currency.**

I feel indifferent about prices. I smile when I see a new service for bitcoin goes up, and it's really sad seeing any of those services end up being a scam or crashing.
Haven't sold a single coin so no fiat gains.
There is no company I know of that is doing what Bitcoin is doing, and I'd rather trust a uncentralised system than a centralised one.
Call it whatever you want, but I want to be part of building something worthwhile up, rather than tearing it down because temporary gains.

There was a post on bitcointalk.org about estimating the total amount of BtC lost permanently. Maybe you can get a good estimate rom there.

Thinking about it, the way to do business that will net you the most amount of money is this:
1. Collect money for pre-orders to fund development of ASIC
2. Finish developing, start mining in secret with some machines without alarming the whole network.
3. Start shipping once customers is on the brink of violence.
4. Ship the ASICs and continue to profit on future sales.

If the blockchain limit problem is solved, it is more desirable to use the bitcoin network itself rather than expose yourself to counter-party risk. 
I believe that the market will balance itself.
* If fees are too low, miners will increase the fees in order to remain profitable. Quitting mining is the last option they'll take because they have already invested in mining hardware.
* If fees are too high, the payment processors will run their own miners.
There are chances of bad outcomes such as payment processors obtain a overwhelmingly large share of mining power and only accepts their own transactions or between their partners. (Essentially becoming another kind of Visa/Mastercard)
It is important that we keep mining decentralized to prevent these situations from developing. Hopefully the ideological miners (mining both for profit and ideology) are always the majority of the bitcoin network.

I don't think Yubikey can help you that much in terms of improving Bitcoin security unless you trust a third party and access the funds through Yubikey (eg. Mt.Gox). I guess you could host a yubikey server yourself on a local machine (doing it on a VPS exposes you to more risk than it is worth)
Since your bitcoin private keys still has to be stored somewhere (local), you really don't gain much.
@_date: 2013-05-14 07:47:07


Oh boy
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:45:37
I'm not familiar with Yubikeys in general, but Trezor stores the private key and only allows certain interaction from the computer (thus secure unless someone steals it physically)
From what I understand, Yubikey is an authentication service/method, not encryption. So you still need to store your private key in plain text somewhere. (e.g. on the server which you also hosts a Yubikey authentication service.) So if I can hack your server by other means, you'll still lose your bitcoins. It's like having a unbreakable front gate but your other fences are made of cheap wood.

Great post. Good explanations and interesting ideas worth exploring.
Thanks for posting.
@_date: 2013-04-26 07:10:52
Good stuff. Just note that you might want to change the "no transaction fee part". Because you do need transaction fee to transfer bitcoins, especially once miners stop processing 0-fee transactions.

To be fair, if the bitcoin network is as big as Visa or Master Card, we'll use more energy

What you need to understand is that Bitcoin isn't gold. Here are some of the reason why attempting to predict the price is very dangerous.
* Its characteristics are constantly evolving (e.g. recent 54uBTC default minimum fee)
* Small market cap. Easy manipulation
* All its critical services small in numbers and most are in their infancy
* Government recognition are still unclear, and they could go either very good or nightmarish bad.
It's fun and all learning about technical analysis and price prediction, just don't use it as a base to play your money with. (I learnt that the hard way)

Much like foreign currencies are largely irrelevant when living in your own country, bitcoin should dominate the internet if it continues to grow, and will likely affect day-to-day transaction for weaker countries.
Practically if you can live using bitcoin alone, then it's value in fiat currencies will largely be irrelevant. I predict that this is possible for someone that has a job closely related to the internet (e.g. freelance workers) in around 7~10 years, if all goes well for bitcoin.

It depends on what kind of 'money' you're in it for.
If you're 'in it' for USD/EUR etc then you are ultimately not helping bitcoin.
If you're 'in it' for Bitcoins, then you are making the future.

Speculators need to realise this fact:
You're raising the value of your bitcoins by establishing services that take bitcoin, and/or spending them.
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:54:49
I thought about it. It's a plausible idea but I don't have enough technical background to deduce how it can be implemented.
Optimally, you don't want your private key stored in plain text anywhere (so you encrypt it into a 'seed' and then generate a constantly changing result along with Yubikey's seed).
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:34:14
Keep a close watch to Mt.Gox queue and Google trends. They'll be a good measure to see whether prices will keep going up.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:08:40
Of course that will be the case. Bitcoin only recently started gaining publicity, and the acceptance will come in time.

Percentage based fees somewhat discourages massive sales or buys that aims to manipulate the market.
Trade spam can be remedied through other means, so a percentage based fee will probably be better most of the time.
