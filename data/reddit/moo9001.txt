Thanks! I have been trying to make the purchase experience as friction-less as possible. Now, if people only could use their Bitcoins for buying something... :)

Virus scanners won't detect most malware nowadays. I find the malware infection (which obviously has bugs regarding certificate spoofing) the most likely explanation.

In LocalBitcoins trade both sides have automatically a wallet on LocalBitcoins.com site. Because the transaction is internal to LocalBitcoins, it can be made off blockchain. This way the transaction is instant, thus making the trade situation easier for both the parties.

If you are not willing to take a risk, reply to existing Sell bitcoins online advertisement and choose a trader with green thumb.
If you wish to trade yourself:
Make the buyer to write "LocalBitcoins purchase XXX" on the deposit slip for the photo.
Do not release on until the money is on your bank account.
Set your trade limits; do not have high volume purchases for people with no reputation or relatively new account.

If you did your customer due dilugence properly you can simply reverse the PayPal dispute for you and keep the payment:
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:11:30
Likely reasons
- No two-factor authentication enabled on the use account
- Malware-infected computer (Windows, Linux, OSX, use of pirated software) or rooted phone (iOS, Android)
- Use of shady free browser add-ons (all those "coin tickers")
- Recycling the same password/username on shady sites
- Accessing the Coinbase from unsafe computer (internet cafe, library, etc.) 
- Giving out username/password to a phishing site / phishing email link
As Bitcoin transaction are not reversible you are not getting your Bitcoins back. I suggest try to get over the incident and take care of your security and cyber hygiene for the future.

If you use LocalBitcons, transaction is from LocalBitcoins wallet to another, inside within the site, off-blockchain and happens instantaneously.
You also get SMS when the seller releases the Bitcoins from the escrow. It is more reliable than doing direct wallet-to-wallet transactions.

Bitstamp owners have already enough money. I rather pay the high fee on Kraken for good service and make them keep it running.
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:03:28
XSS is not an option on LocalBitcoins because you need to enter either your password or 2FA code to withdraw from your wallet.
Inside job is not an option if there is a wallet log entry showing you a transfer out from your wallet. If it were an inside job you could take the whole wallet once.  
@_date: 2014-09-10 09:14:01
You'd be losing the fees.
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:43:43
The premium depends on e.g. 
- Risk (PayPal et. al. credit card based payment methods attract more fraud and sellers price this in)
- Amount of work per trade (settings up a cash trade is more cumbersome)
- National market situation (less sellers, less competition, higher prices)
and also
- Is Bitcoin doing bear or bull. If Bitcoin value is rising fast sellers tend to sit on their Bitcoins by putting on higher margins.

You can also ask LocalBitcoins to provide the user details for a police report.

With 40 million and incredible team most people kind of expect little better outcome. After all, they have hyped it themselves, so if the shit doesn't stick to the wall, there will be naturally backlash. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:23:52
This lists presents your options:
Because the seller has most of the risk in escrow transactions (bank chargeback the cash deposits), you just need to pick one. Please note that the seller may reject such high transaction for first time buyer as there is some fraud risks even in cash deposits. 
It would be foolish to try this kind of transaction outside LocalBitcoins escrow.
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:54:33
Leave negative feedback "scammer warning" on 30second user until LocalBitcoins staff gets the user banned.
Open a fraudulent buyer support ticket on LocalBitcoins and submit any evidence (screenshots, emails) of the fraudulent transfers.
If the escrow has not been released yet you can get the bitcoins back to you through a dispute on LocalBitcoins:
If the bank in the question does not have two-factor authentication it could be that someone got access to the account through a Windows malware and wanted to quickly flush the account before getting caught.
For the future you can tight up your advertisement requirements. If SurePay shows the payment sender name turn on "real name required" and ask the buyers to supply an id which matches the the payment sender name. All documents can be faked, but this is a showstopper for most fraudsters who are not always very bright.

LocalBitcoins has been around for 2.5 years which one indicator you can use in your risk assessment.

CoinBase going rogue is not worth of 1 BTC. 99% cases it is the user (you) who has had his account compromised. 1% cases it is some balance updating problem which is usually fixed by the devs on the following day. Spending money to your lawyer won't do any good, only makes you lose more money.
So if Coinbase told you "API was hacked" have you a proof of this? Do they mention if your API key was compromised?
Instead, I would focus the efforts just cleaning up your computers and devices.

What browser you are using? Any addons which could cause this?

If the Bitcoins don't go through LocalBitcoins site and the fee is taken, they do not show up in the books.
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:01:16
Looks like fixed now.

Maybe your account was flagged for high risk for some other reason, not just because of using Bitcoin. Potential reasons I can think include using IP address associated with fraud or using Tor.
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:14:38
Read  before engaging any online transaction - also you can ask guidance on LocalBitcoins forums

Thanks for this. It's an issue with the certificate issuer and Android:  I have notified LBC team about the matter.
Some certificates apparently work on PC, but not mobile out of the box.

Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous. Only if somebody (you) reveals that a particular Bitcoin address belongs to LocalBitcoins and is the one you used for LocalBitcoins transaction, then it might be technically possible to get more information out which is associated with the transaction.
However, there exist a concept of Bitcoin mixing services to make Bitcoin transactions and addresses less traceable: 
If you send Bitcoins through a mixing service the transaction traceability is severely limited and tracing them back to any source address becomes very difficult. Though Bitcoin mixing services themselves might be somewhat shady and unreliable.

Just to note this answer is factually incorrect. OpenSSL issue affects servers, not browsers.

I am former CTO of LocalBitcoins. I have not been working with the LBC team for a half of a year now. I have never used CoinBase.
I received the scam email at a test / honeypot email address I had set up on LocalBitcoins.com. The email address is not published anywhere. The email address is not used on any other site besides LocalBitcoins, so this is a 100% proof the email leak is definitely on LocalBitcoins. There might be other leaks besides LBC I am not aware of.
The scammers took the list LocaBitcoins email accounts list, then used CoinBase email infrastructure to deliver the scam message.

You cannot keep stolen property and banks can always take it away from you. If you don't reverse voluntarily your account will be frozen and it will be seized. If you accept stolen money and you did not comply to local Known Your Customer rules (check the id of the bitcoin buyer) you are sloppy. So I suggest the persons doing over-the-counter trading simply check the ids of the other party and you are fine.

A lot of people are trading on Chase:
Maybe you should ask on LocalBitcoins traders forums: 
The tolerance to bitcoin trading varies from a bank to a bank. If the bank account is critical for your business I would consider opening another account for the trading. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 17:10:44
Many banks are starting to block transfers to bitcoin exchanges, as they do not want to touch to bitcoin even with a long stick. I know this happens at least in Israel and Scandinavia and probably soon starts to spread. They block transfers per receiving account(s), not per country. The lowest ranked bank official probably don't know why the block is in place.
Decentralized exchanges are the way to go, as then you are trading between users and there is no single point of failure.

Traders who sell on PayPal take very high risk premiums due to friendly chargeback fraud. It is still popular from the buyer point of view, but requires balls of steel on the side of the seller.

LocalBitcoins holds bitcoins in escrow to prevent the seller of bitcoin to run away with money. 
Also PayPal payment are reversible, so your free money is charged back.
