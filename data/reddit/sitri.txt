Here is the only way I see this working: Companies using bitcoin pay money for the latest, fastest, and most complete blockchain data. Groups similar to private torrent trackers spring up to fill this demand, they take the money and work out their own systems for paying it to the best nodes. This would make it possible to reward nodes that had useful connections and not just nodes sitting idle. It would also allow the private tracker to verify the data matched correctly and wasn't just garbage, so like mining, some work would be done to justify the money it was getting. Ratios could be enforced also like they are today for bandwidth.

No, small merchants should not be turning every sale into an investment like you are implying, they should be using it to grow themselves and pay the immediate expenses to keep going.

Bitcoin is just an implementation of a block chain. The idea of a shared ledger could change the world, but that doesn't mean Bitcoin will. Why should any of us care about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-10 05:37:33
This is a great point, Bitcoin is very much in your control. But the question that we might see answered in a year is: Is BTC valued at 477 today because of the control, or is it largely due to speculation that the low fee easy to use online payment system that changes the world is going to be Bitcoin and not Apple Pay.

Money is actually being converted in this example, USD -&gt; BRL. Saying that doing a BTC -&gt; BTC transfer is sooo much more simple is the same as saying they should have done USD -&gt; USD.
The reality is that if you wanted to do this same thing with BTC the most common flow today is: 
* USD -&gt; Sender's BTC Exchange (Exchange Fee)
* Send BTC to receiver wallet (transfer fee)
* Send BTC to receiver's exchange (transfer fee)
* Exchange BTC for BRL (Exchange fee) 
* Withdraw to BRL bank account.

But if you think about it, Letterman really didn't need a computer in 1995. The internet was very limited, and like he points out about listening to a baseball game, it wasn't really solving any problems in a better way.

Bitcoin is designed with different goals, it can't be "fixed" to work for opposite goals without becoming less effective at the purpose it serves today.

Yeah.. that is pretty bad. It is going to be a big jump for them just to start scaling and move to multiple servers then.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:30:48


You can't just throw endless money at something to make it scale. Even if they could get unlimited servers and the space to put them up by the next day the software still isn't going to scale endlessly, there is always a bottleneck somewhere. At minimum they are limited by how well the blockchain and bitcoin scale, which hasn't been that great.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:16:35
The fact that so many people jumped at the small sell-off you mentioned signals huge problems with the state of BTC, not Mt.Gox. Most people believe it's a bubble, this isn't some media conspiracy. Calling Gox's servers inadequate is just ignorant, all sites go down when they experience an unprecedented amount of traffic just like reddit during Obama's AMA. The real issue here is that people are approaching BTC as a get rich quick scheme and that is why the price is all over the place, not because of all the BS people keep reassuring each other with in the echo chamber.

Yesterday was the first time I bought some coins, previously I had just mined for fun. I had avoided buying since I was so annoyed at the things I was seeing posted in this subreddit about how to value BTC, but yesterday was the first time I actually saw this subreddit telling people not to buy. Since this subreddit is always wrong I knew it was time, and it was.

Amazon won't get into bitcoins because there is way too much potential for losing money when the price changes. IF Amazon actually did accept them they would have to do it in a way where they would inadvertently become the largest bitcoin exchange, only it would be one way and they would just set a price of probably $10/BTC and the rest of the market would have to adjust since Amazon's size would pretty much make it the central authority for BTC.

Buy SLL (another virtual currency) and exchange those for BTC. It's an extra hoop to jump through but SLL is extremely stable and has hardly moved in the last year so you don't have to worry too much about that part.

I blame the people selling for that, not the lag or the bots. If people want to sell they should be able to. If they need up to date info they can look on other exchanges that aren't lagged. What is probably happening here is that the lag is just triggering other bots to sell. So if you were smart you would write a bot to benefit from this problem instead of complaining about it.

Cars and roads are tools and we don't usually blame them for accidents. But what if tomorrow there was a 2nd set of highways that sprang up and they were not policed, all drivers were anonymous, no one could be punished when there was an accident, and illegal cargo could be moved with zero threat of getting stopped? Would this new system be a completely blameless tool also?
I don't want to see bitcoin regulated anymore than the next person, but let's be honest about it and acknowledge that the design could be changed to make it better align with general society. Not that it has to or should, but until then the criticism is valid.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:28:04
The USD/BTC amount is equivalent to how much trust people have in BTC. That trust, which was bringing the wider business adoption, just plummeted. 
If you want to go all the way down to the fundamentals then we should question if BTC is even the correct implementation of a crypto-currency to use. Maybe we should be using SolidCoin or something else, but dropping BTC and picking up something else is going to make businesses even more nervous about accepting a virtual currency.
Stability is key here, and the price of BTC doesn't matter for the uses of bitcoin, so saying that this lack of stability is good is just wrong.

Bitcoin is different because you would lose wealth. When a better trading site comes along I don't lose everything I invested in ETrade. However if people were to switch to litecoin because more places accepted it, then the value of btc would plummet and I would lose a lot.
I agree with all those things on why it is valuable, they are great, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for a competitor there and the effects of one could be devastatingly unique since bitcoin is unique.

With all things digital the biggest danger isn't a hacker stealing your data, it's losing it by mistake or to a hardware failure. I've lost so many things just like op by taking the extremely complicated way that seems like 'the right way to do it' but the safety just doesn't outweigh the risk of your own mistakes. Everyone needs to take note and learn a lesson from this instead of trying to shrug it off and pretend they are immune.

Stop with the "the crash is great for bitcoin" circlejerk spin already. This kind of volatility is horrible for any merchants trying to accept it and run a legit business. A virtual currency doesn't need to be this way, and if it keeps up it is going to have people avoiding anything without a central authority.

Buying bitcoins is the same as investing in any other tech start up in a way. Why do you have to follow a certain religious view to invest in it? That sort of thing may have helped bitcoin to start but it is just a cancer that is going to slow it down later.

I guess you could look at it that way, but don't you think the price per bitcoin is just a little affected by new coins appearing out of thin air? At the start of this year the reward was halved and shortly after the price began to climb. Was that just a coincidence in your opinion?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:09:21
First off the price is going still ~120 on Gox only because it has been frozen. BTC-E is showing 65 right now, so it's a given that people are going to dump coins for any price above that. Many more will sell just because they don't want to get stuck while Gox freezes again.
If BTC was worth even 100 right now people would be buying it up until that price on the other exchanges. But they aren't. When Gox opens best case it will only fall to somewhere in the middle like ~90. Worst case is it will fall to ~40. 
The reason people want to sell off is because historically when bubbles pop like this they don't come back, or if takes many many years for them to return to a breaking even level. You could potentially just cut your losses now and invest in something else that will do better than BTC over the next 5 years.
BTC might go up again in the next couple weeks, but it won't today when Gox reopens. I guarantee it.

You are forgetting that there are competing crypto currencies and you are comparing general technologies like email to a very specific implementation of one which is what Bitcoin is.
The SMTP protocol for email has existed for 30 years yes, crypto currency will exist in some P2P form for that long also I'm sure. But Bitcoin as you are referring to it in a way where you will profit massively is just the blockchain data. Why should people continue adopting our blockchain 30 years from now instead of using something better?
It would be similar to if when email had started there was a rule that everyone needed to put the name and email address of all known email users in their signature and send that along with each email and then expecting that in 30 years people would still honor that and your place as  on that original list. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:03:59
The speed of the transactions makes no difference, it was just more painful to watch in slow motion, but the price could have fallen to 100 in a fraction of a second also and you would have had no time to cancel orders. 
I also don't think canceling orders would have made a difference. Limit orders went in at their set price, only people who panic sold at market place would have gotten a different price than they expected.
Had Gox actually halted trading you would have seen people on other exchanges panic even harder, making the price fall very low on those exchanges as everyone sat there hitting F5 over and over waiting for Gox to reopen so they could dump everything at the new super low price before other Gox users did.

Very good points on the govt backing thing, but I still don't think it is enough to say that bitcoin is great because the network is great. Myspace use to be great because it's network was great, and then facebook became a better network.

Gold is used in electronics and all sorts of things. It has a value beyond being rare. If I was the only person left on earth gold would still be useful to me in some ways, bitcoins on the other hand would be beyond worthless. They are have value ONLY because the system makes them rare.
Just because some cloning attempts failed doesn't mean it will never happen.

I couldn't disagree with you more. Mining will scale larger and larger until the profit margin is too thin. A few thousand coins a day a whole lot of coins when you consider that the people mining those were only expecting to get 10-15 USD for them. The people who are after mining $40 ones are only just starting to come online. The difficultly will go up, but things will still scale to meet it.

People in Cypress losing 10% of their bank accounts is still way less than people losing over half their money when BTC went from 260 to 50. *Someday* BTC could be more stable than all those european countries you listed, but it isn't today so I don't think anyone living in reality is going to beg to differ on that.

Avoid all the paranoid fantasy advice which makes up most of these comments. Don't use any technologies you aren't familiar with. Since you are most likely going to hold these a while your biggest risk is losing coins due to your own mistakes, be it that you forgot your password, hardware failure, or natural disaster. 
Backup your wallet to several usb thumb drives and leave it unencrypted. Don't leave the coins sitting on mt. gox for months, and to be extra secure remove the wallet from any internet connected machines once you back it up. If you find any of it confusing or too hard you shouldn't be doing it at all.

Bitcoin only gives you less options to fight back where as with a CC you could at least dispute the charges if you get ripped off. 
Bitcoin needs average people to adopt if it is going to make it to $1000, yet it gives them more ways to screw themselves over than it does benefits.

7200 x 365 = 2,628,000 which is 23% of the current total coins. That isn't minor.

And yet nailclip is getting down voted all over the place. Looks like the crazies are back, all aboard the next bubble!

You are misinformed on how bitcoin mining works as well as cryptography in general.

A flood of panicked users loading the site and putting in orders is far more stress on a system than bots connecting through an API. This witch hunt for the laggers is just silly.

I'd believe you if you had returned the 0.7 to the sender instead of moving it to another address. And yeah.. that PDF would have an exploit. No one on this subreddit should accept random PDFs from people on here if they want to keep their coins.

What are you basing that on?

0.01% is pretty small, I am probably wrong. but all 10M coins aren't in play at all times. dumping 1000 coins a day against the actual bids could impact it far more than 0.1%

Why will there be a huge shortage soon?

I like the memes better than the extremely long self posts whoring for tips. People are just in a pissy mood today with the drop I think.

Yep. Everyone thinks by being P2P it is invincible, yet look at all the other P2P networks the US has killed. And how it killed online gambling at the bank level. They could do the same to bitcoin plus so much more if they were interested, especially if they were to claim it was funding terrorist groups.

To profit off the pyramid scheme side of it and destroy the central banks.

this pretty much summarizes why I'm sick of seeing posts like this about expanding this pyramid scheme and not developing things for btc instead.

Political goals/religious views. Same thing. Let people do the math and make it just an investment if they want.

seems like it was pretty safe so far
