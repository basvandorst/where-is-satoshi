Indeed. Nor should the american people support bitcoin over USD. You are literally throwing power away.
Of course people here mostly just want to get rich quick. Most people don't really care about tax evasion, inflation (most people don't have any money to inflate), or anonymity (most people don't buy drugs 24/7). 
A global currency is a terrible idea. Its also why the Euro sucks ass. Different economies have different outputs and thus require different monetary policies. Otherwise you get problems like Greece in the EU. Germany wanted a strong currency for its strong economy and Greece wanted a weak currency. Of course no way in hell are the big countries going to adjust to the crappy ones. 
Basically only someone who is completely uneducated about economics would think a single currency is a good idea.

Bad anology. If soemone etched something on the road. The logical procedure is to repave the road.
If someone put something on the internet. Then take it down. The internet is not a single place. Its a network of individual computers. Remove the computers hosting the content.
The unique situation with blockchain is everyone is hosting the illegal information. Obviously banning it outright seems extreme. But letting it pass opens it for exploitation. What if you make a blockchain with the sole purpose of distributing illegal information. Of course on the surface you would say its a coin that does whatever. Why would one be banned and bitcoin be allowed to pass if it had similar images on it.
Then pedophiles can just say they are investors. I think we can all agree this is bad. We also dont want bitcoin to go away. Its up for society or at least a judge to decide what to do. But people shouldnt say it doesnt matter. Because it does matter and its a big can of worms that can open on you if you ignore it.

Not all government money is financed by inflationary printing. Most of it is borrowed through selling government securities.
Second. If the government swapped to crypto and cant print money. They would just stick with USD and simply not print any if thats their only card to play.
Finally. The problem isnt with USD. Its fucking politicians. To think they would adopt bitcoin just so they can save the country from themselves is just silly.

Seems like people dont know what capitalism is. Doing something for profit is NOT capitalism. Thats just called being nornal. A lion eating you is not capitalism. Not every case is doing something for personal benefit rather than public good can be cinsidered capitalism.
Capitalism is an economic or political system. Only as a whole can you describe it as capitalism. You can have dictators pilligaging a country for profit. You can have micro interactions where people protect their personal interests or work for profits and not have capitalism.

The american government doesnt owe 21 trillion dollars. Including unfunded obligations such as medicare and pensions and various things they promised to pay at a future day. The present value of that plus all the debt individual states owe and they own unfunded obligations puts the US debt anywhere from 100 trillion to estimates of up to 200 trillion.
Since they are only obligated to pay back in dollars. If purchasing power of the dollar gets erroded. You effectively get paid less. Aka all government benefits gets slashed. Economic disaster like you said.
I do not support Bitcoin as a official currency and definitely not a global currency. Crypto is such a small space owned by only a handful of wallets. It will fuck wealth distribution more than it already is. However i do think it can serve as a niche for the odd time you do want to move money between borders or want anonymity.

Its not about vetting ads. Its straight up illegal to advertise securities. If you are uncertain. The extremely long list of things the SEC defines as securities does include the word "tokens" and a bunch of other stuff that pegs crypto as a form of security for sure. Many US courts already C&amp;D many ICOs for selling illegal securities. So its only natural that they are subjected to advertisement laws. 
So an outright ban on the ads sounds about right.

WRONG!! I trade MTG cards and they dont behave like stocks :D. But bitcoin totally follows the rules of FOMO investors buying in expecting lambos and getting gutted afterwards. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:50:16
For it to be stable and people still able to buy lamos, there must be a continous inflow to balance out the lambos going out. Thus the zero sum game is still going on but still zero sum.
You need to identify what the inflows are and what the outflows are. Basically new money paying out old money.

There is a difference between what you perceive as money and what is actually money. Aka all the laws the regulate money. This is not about perception, its literally important what the court thinks of it.

I wouldnt say cash is useless on the internet. Like physical paper money yea but theres no distinction between that and digital cash.
Yes bitcoin is up. The thing is. In economics, people dont like the term "demand for cash". Because money is intrinsically worthless and thus has no real demand. People just want what cash can buy, lambos and such. Economist prefer the term "demand for liquidity". One problem with bitcoin is it doesnt actually offer liquidity. In fact if you bought in at a high price, you are forced to realize a loss or basically become insolvent.
Which is why a lot of the bs about crypto being a currencymakes no sense. It basically oly has currency in its name. Just a speculative asset atm. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:00:08
This is also based on the assumption crypto transactions have a lower marginal cost than a regular credit transaction.
People dismiss the 2% cashback because the bill eventually rests on the consumer in the form of higher product prices.
How crypto works is you get taxed by miners in the form of inflation. This isnt obvious to many people but thats what happens. So crypto isnt free either. Theres not much gained by moving credit cards to blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:35:50

The problem is.... Bitcoin isnt changing the world. A high price doesnt mean high adoptance. In fact its adoption rateis incredibly low, almost close to zero.

A steak or a house has subjective value. It can be worth nothing tomorrow if sentiments change. Though you can imagine people always needing houses to live in. Cant crash to $0. But people dont really need or use bitcoin as of now which makes its support really flimsy.
But subjective value aside. Everyone can agree a $10 bill is worth more than a $5 bill. Two steaks is worth more than 1 steak. Apple the company holding $200bn cash is worth at least that.

But its unlikely one person would hold the entire bitcoin supply. Like you need at least 5% of the wallets to own 98% of total coin supply. Still there will be a market for bitcoin and its value in goods/services can be established otherwis it wont worm as a currencyat all. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:57:03
What? Like literally they wont all be lent out at exactly the same time with the same maturity date as a single payment. But if suppose if that did occur, the party who did the borrowing would have the default. I see no conflict.

 It makes sense if you know the future and bitcoin will go to 10k. But at the time people didnt want the remaining bitcoin which was falling off a cliff. They wanted their original investment in fiat.
But this method is exactly the same as dividing up the BTC. The cash they generated cab simply be used to buy the coins back. Weather the creditors do that after they get paid is up to them. But theoretically if everyone buys back, bitcoin prices might go to around 20k again.

For prices to be stable. There must be large trading volume from many buyers and sellers. There must also be products priced in BTC. For example when USD drops, other countries can import US goods for a cheaper price thus raising demand for USD. Its a self stabilizing mechanism...unless your country has no exports and is sketchy as fuck. 
Crypto is currently not backed by anything. No business accepts it or at least ties their product to a fix BTC price. For example if they sold Lambos for 30 BTC and BTC drops to $1 a pop, then everyone would rush in to buy BTC to trade in for lambos. Except we got none of that adoption. Simply 100% speculation. There is no desire to have a falling bitcoin.

Indeed. Thats a huge problem right now. But thats government debt and not exactly associated with inflating the money supply. You can still have debt even if you dont print money.
The problem isnt the monetary system. Its overspending fromthe US government. There are too many social services up to a point where only the richest 20% actually pay any taxes. The bottom 80% of people actually receive more social services from the government than they pay. This is obviously unsustainable but no politician want to cut spending because they are pussies. They want to buy votes.
Bitcoin wont solve government debt.

People take fiat on the expectation it will retain the exact same value not a higher valuation in the future. Not to the moon buy lambos.
Instead a business will have to pay wages and suppliers. The suppliers will charge a price for their goods. Lets say $1000 USD. You can sell your product for $2000 USD. No matter what exchange rate USD becomes, even if it gets inflated to oblivion. You still only owe your supplier that $1000. Its guaranteed profit.
Accepting foreign currencies exposes yourself to higher transaction fees. Extra hassle and exposes yourself to market volitility. If someone tried to pay me USD in my business. Ill tell them no!! I dont want to deal with exchanging USD. Its just not worth it.
The only reason why you subject yourself to that with BTC is because to the moon and lambos. Its certainly not as low cost or easy as cash and debit.

A lot of people were giving investment advice in the form of "hodl". If you look around, those people were all green because they got in early. They were basically under the mindset of losing house money. Which is fallacious in itself, house money is the same as principal.
Meanwhile people who were literally losing money who didnt know what to do were confused. Then you got people who are still green saying crap like "whatever, you shouldnt have invested more than you can afford to lose anyway". But at the same time these people say stuff like "its unstoppable, 30k end of month for sure" which implied no or low risk.
Lots of shilling in the cryoto market.

 They will buy less and less if the price gets higher. Who wants to be the last guy to buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:37:25
Let me elaborate.
Monetary policy is changing money supply to suit the economy. In economics there are times you want to devalue your own currency. Inflation is a core mechanic to keep the economic engine running. Countries such as Greece who do not control their own money supply do not have a shock absorbig mechanism when shit falls apart. They cant devalue their currency to make their goods/services marketable. This is why a "Greexit" was talked about.
When the price goes down, difficulty of mining will not adjust. Difficulty adjust when the hash pool decreases. It will decrease only if miners exit the market due to price going down. But what im saying is how much it will cost the end user. The end user will have to pay by inflation on the crypto economy or transaction fees. The cost for running those ant miners far exceed the cost of a centralized computer. Somebody will pay. You might not feel the inflation from crypto but its there.
People buying bitcoin to help their wealth is pure specuation. Some people trade forex to scalp the market but the broader economy do not buy currency expecting it to go up. If your main currency is deflating, people will not spend money and hoard it. Thus halting economic activity beyond basic read and butter needs.
You dont need to perfectly time the market. You just need to be able to indentify what it is doing and the end game. Just a bunch of FOMO investors throwing their monry at something hoping to double it next month. To the MOON!!! LOL. You need to look at that and say... Fuck that shit... Or im entering with a tight stop. I am attacking those who litterally think this will get 1 mill per coin and replace 10% of all fiat currency because its not currency, not even close. Also nobody is selling gold and rushing into crypto. Its not even close to a store of value. You mihht have heard it from some retards on CNBC but look at gold prices.
Why do people need to use it? Because using it gives people a reason to keep it. Ever watch rick and morty where Jerry has some star wars coins. He thinks they are cool and collectable. He didnt buy them just because he expects to drive lambos at the end of the month. When prices fall, there is zero reason to keep bitcoin other than the greedy expectation than "it will be back up". For example if USD drops to 1 cent canadian. Then there will be a self stabilizaing mechanism. Canadians will buy USD and then use that USD to buy US goods at 99% discount. Money will flood into the US economy and prop up the dollar. Also americans cant afford to sell out because they need to remain liquid. You dont need to hold bitcoin to operate. It makes the market volitile and toxic. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:47:43
Your wallet is on the blockchain fully visible. Youre just referring to your private key.
The beauty of keeping real cash is.... Well its actual currency. So you can just outright spend it. Ya sure the government cant track pirvate coins but how do you intend to use it? Convert it to fiat on an exchange? The government can see that, the step where itgoes back into fiat.
Chinese people has been cheating the system with cash for years. You dont need to convert it on an exchange. Its alrwady cashed. The notes arent on some fancy ledger. Its physically in your hands and nobody can see it. You can spend it, make more, spend it again without paying any taxes. Not even sales tax if you buy from a guy who knows whats up.
Only problem with cash is it does go between borders very well. You cant buy big items with it. Thats where crypto comes in. You probably dont care about oaying taxes on drug money. You mostly want an excuse to why you have so much money. Just say, ummmm bitcoin is up. Pay your taxes, and the government thibks you have legit lambos

If they accept bitcoin for lambo then its technically still a zero sum game.
Person A: -BTC +Lambo
Person B: +BTC -Lambo
Sum is zero
The current industry practice is to accept bitcoin for purchases but prices are just in USD or whatever and you pay the bitcoin equivalent. Lamborghini will probably sell bitcoin to remain solvent and pays its suppliers. (part of the reason why bitcoin is currently terrible as currency is because you might lose like 60% if you don't sell out immediately and then you become insolvent and die)
Anyway. I think you are thinking of a scenario that we haven't achieved and that is everything become bitcoin. Everyone just buys in and done deal, we do everything with bitcoin now. 
One problem with that model is how you price bitcoin. You are probably thinking we would price it at the value that the last person paid (aka the market cap). However we know that cash flow and market cap are two different things. It can't possibly trade as if every coin is worth the last coin otherwise you are expanding the money supply aka inflation. Inflation money is not free. The sum will always be zero. Money can't be an investment. Its simply a medium of exchange with no value in itself. Whats valuable is goods and services.
A company can create goods and services and add utility and satisfaction (wealth) to the pool.
EDIT: I take everything back for I am wrong. I have come to the realization that the memes add wealth.

Many people take bitcoin only on the expectation that it will be more valuable in the future. 
They certainly don't do it because of cheap transaction fees or convenience. Its basically speculation and not legitimacy.

Just remember. Many companies are still below their year 2000 valuation. There is no guarantee it will moon again. It can go up some more and dip again. Or maybe dip a lot and then go back up.
First rule about trading is "past results is not an indicator for future performance" yet everyone here is basing their trades on exactly that because confirmation bias. They pick a timeframe that conforms to their bias and trades off it. So many traders died in 2017/2018 saying it will just be a tiny dip. 
You have to search your soul. Are you just asking this question because you want confirmation? Be careful of that.

I said it the whole climb up. But i didnt just say those this. I gave in my opinion, valid reasons. Nobody has effectively attacked my reasons. They just brushed it aside. Meanwhile the people who said it will be up and up are just guessing. No reasons, just made up numbers. People on TV just make some shit up, lets see gold is worth this much. Why cant bitcoin, lets take that number. Hey theres this much regular currency, why cant gold replace some arbitrary number of it. Forget how it gets to that point, 200k per coin!!
Why i think it will fall
1. Bitcoin cant controlled to change monetary policy
2. Overhead is too costly to maintain. Miners want to get paid. You must make it worth it for them. You are paying for redundancy.
3. Currency that appreciates, effectively deflates overtime. Dangerous for the economy .
4. Hacks are too easy and frequent. No asset recovery. Whens thd last time stock markets got robbed.
5. Everyone basically FOMOs it and not actually using it.
6. Parabolic move will crash as soon as fuel runs out tok many people have too much juicy gains not to cash out if it starts to fall.

People like to say things with perfect information in hindsight.
Like 2 pizzas is worth a fraction of a BTC right now....but maybe you shouldn't spend any BTC even right now. Maybe you should just starve to death because it could be 1000x more next year. Or maybe you should buy all the pizzas right now because BTC might crash to zero. Then you would be the idiot who didn't buy 10,000 Pizzas for 2 bitcoin. Instead you would be buying 2 Pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin again.
My point is. People shouldn't say things in hindsight. It was a pretty fair deal at the time. I feel bad that the guy gets so much shit. Thats all he would be remembered for.

I think what he means is he wants the remaining coins to be sold and distributed rather than being sold by the trustee and given all back to him in the form of yen.
He has mo control over the procedure. By the time he has control. The coins would be sold and any amount given to him will be subject to taxes. Then if he were to distribute this cash to investors. They would be subject to income tax on top.

I trade stocks intra-day. I make short term predictions and on the minute chart. If it doesnt go how i predicted within 10 minutes, then im going to admit im shit at trading and predicted wrong and just close my position because whats happening is just gambling. Even if i do get my money back eventually (but theres no gaurantee for that) 
There are people who hodl when they lose. Its just a coping mechanism to desensitize themselves to loss. If they recover, they will sweep in and claim "they KNEW IT!!!" Lets be honest here, they knew shit. Had they have actually known, they would have bought the bottom. Its a really bad trading strategy. Actually its not even a legitimate strategy. Its just gambling really. Its a strategy that would always work until it doesnt. It only works on assets that constantly break all time highs. Once that stops hodling doesnt do anything. It has no logic or predictive element. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:54:00
Most people see bitcoin is a 0 risk investment. They see that bitcoin has crashed in the past (due to different reasons) so they think it can never die. Actually historically a crash is followed by a bull run (for different reasons) so they think its on a cycle. (each up and down cycle was for different reasons so its most definitely not on a cycle but thats what people believe, risk free. Always rise from the ashes like a phoenix)
As said, people are irrationally optimistic.

Falae equivalence fallacy. Alt coins or even cash can be functionally the same as bitcoin. It isnt exactly the same thing but the function of transferring value can be the same, thus making alt coins perfectly good alternatives.

Thats one of the narratives people tell others. Just some nonsensical crap to get people to buy. Like you are destroying the economy built for the rich and ushering in a new age where crypto cannot be printed by the government and people can never take your money which is on an immutable blockchain.
Except 2% of wallets own 98% of all coins. So essentially you are actually supporting an ecosystem thats even more oppressive and has even more inequality than real money. Most of these "whales" didn't climb to the top with their competence like people such as Bill Gates who made something with real utility. Instead crypto whales just bought in early. If these people were to have power, then you are in trouble.

Not true. Intrinsic value is the amount of utility you can derrive from something. Its value thats intrinsic to the asset, not the cost sunk into acquiring it.
Price is the amount someone is willing to pay for something with that utility. Sometimes price = intrinsic value. Sometimes things can be under or overvalued. 
A lot of mining companies operate mines with less ore yield than expected. Does that mean the rocks they mined have high intrinsic value? Nope, it just means they mined garbage.

"There is no loss in something that you already lost and forgot"
This is the exact type of fallacious thinking im talking about. I know some people are okay with losing. But that doesnt mean its logical to do so.
I dont think theres any misconceptions here. No sense arguing anymore. We are both seeing the exact same thing. It boils down to me saying its a bad idea and you being fine with it.

People can spot chart patterns but fail to apply the necessary logic. Something like a mt gox hack casuing a crash is completely different to a speculative bubble bursting without outside influence. They cant be compared at all. Especailly not thrown into some retarded cycle prediction. There is no underlying reason of why its a cycle at all, instead its just a very small sample of events thats not remotely related.

Im not saying people initial investments are wrong when they made then. But doubling down on a falling knife is often wrong. Its how people react when reality doesnt go according to expectations. People call themselves long term investors who are not interested in quick cash. Well here we see people buying more when its only $3000 cheaper. Thats nothing in the grand scheme of things if they truly believe bitcoin will take off and go to 200k+.
The truth is they are emotional and not making logical decisions. They do want to make their money back asap. We all feel that way when on a losing trade. My point is there is a risk to buying. Dont let your emotions take over. Dont FOMO or double down. Those actions are fallacious.

@_date: 2018-12-07 16:14:10
Its never recommended to catch a fallin knife. Buying more is simply a desperate attempt to make your money back.
People dont want to admit they suck at trading and that they are dying inside. So they average down telling themselves its part of their strategy. If they truly believe bitcoin or whatever stock will hit their price targets of $200k or whatever, they dont need to average down. But you know, say one thing and do another right?
If you find yourself in that situation then its probably best to just take your losses because you clearly dont know what you're doing. Thats my strategy anyway. Put my money in voitile tech stocks, lose 2%, eat my losses and leave because my prediction is clearly wrong. No denial, no average down. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:52:06
Sorry but thats a terrible idea.
Heres the problem. The argument is bitcoin might not be the future. The price is dropping. Your predictions are already wrong in the short term and might be wrong in the long term as well. If your counter argument is "what can you achieve in life with a few grand anyway" is not a logical response.
Its actually just a coping mechanisn to justify loss. Its to densensitize yourself. That method of thinking is inheriently fallacious. Its actually a very common form of emotional trading. Thats what im getting at. Prospects change. Prices changes. Sticking to one strategy even if its failing prompts proper re-evaluation not just keep doing the same thing and pray it gets better.

Could be possible. You have to imagine who is even buying right now? Certainly not any new money. They banned credit cards so noobs cant FOMO anymore.
A lot of bitcoin veterans sold all year long so they have plenty of money but i highly doubt it will make a straight line to 6k. A lot of idiots expect markets to move linearly. A lot of "experts" called for 30k to 50k last year. A lot of people called for 6k to break much sooner. That linear movement mentality is often wrong more than its correct..
It will probably lose steam at $4200. Maybe it will rise again but its hard to tell how people react. You can only make predictions on short term moves based on momentum alone. Some people are sitting in 25% profit ready to pull the rug.
