it is super loud. i made the song at the end, i wish andreas would just get me or someone else to compress the videos so as to make the talking more audible. often it's so quiet that my laptop on full barely cuts it.

fun fact: i made the music for this video.
this is the only time, apart from a donation i received years ago from a bitcointalk user where my bitcoin life and my music life have crossed paths.
i can't wait until art + bitcoin really combine.

Did he say that was "working well"? 
or is your comparison so obtuse as to be completely misleading?
hint: he was describing a worst case scenario.

Thanks! And yeah that was a nightmare. Glad his team started making all the levels match. (They've also started raising the volume for questions too).

yeah sorry for the slow response. [Soundcloud](

Exactly the same here. Andreas knows when diplomacy has to give way to self preservation. Was a lovely boost hearing my music at the end too, it feels like one of the few ways I've contributed to bitcoin. (Aside from buying a few and battling /btc trolls).

Unfortunately Falkvinge seems to completely misunderstand bitcoin. I dare say Max Keiser understands it better.

Thanks. I have disabled the "Put hard disks to sleep when not in use" option. But I will try streaming a movie off the drive to force it to stay awake.

I like Rick, he really has no clue what he's talking about though regarding bitcoin software.
