I'm sorry, that was my mistake. I shouldn't have asked you what you do and how your security and threat model is.
Let me try again. What I should have asked was this:
You'r telling me you consider it unlikely that the average node operator don't check their e-mail and/or browse reddit for 10-15 minutes during their breakfest? Or their lunch break?
And during that time they wouldn't have time to log in and type two simple commands to update their node?

The graph you link to has a resolution of 24 hours. Not a great tool to learn about things that happen on an hour/minute scale.
Have a look at this list (you can graph it if you like).
See if you can spot the attack, and the ~510 nodes coming back online much more "organic".

Number of BU nodes online with much shorter interval than OP graph during the attack:
767 759 756 761 770 769 776 771 765 771 774 776 696 305 276 245 182 215 265 304 325 344 359 365 381 530 626 647 658 669 665 681 687 692
The "regrowth" looks fairly organic to me...

    sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
That doesn't take very long to type...

approx one hour I think.
Let me check, and find the link to the page where I found the numbers. Will post that link in a minute :)
Edit: Posted the link in a new message, but I guess someone doesn't want you to see. If only there was somewhere to speak freely.

That makes no sense.
If people sleep for 8 hours and work/stud for 8 hours, they have time during the 11 hours to update.
And the data even show nodes were updating at different times, during the 11 hours. Suggesting it was done when ever people had time, was awake or so, depending on timezone, work, family and so on.
