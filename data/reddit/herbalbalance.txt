i think im fucked lol i did it, it said transaction complete but now the coins are not showing up in electrum

i basically just want to transfer the BTC, and then immediately send it to my account on bittrex, so my main concern is no errors getting it out of the bitcoin core, it was actually a blessing in disguise that my BTC got stuck there because other wise i would have taken it out back in june but now ive learned so much more and am taking crypto more seriously

thanks for the response, i think i will just sweep it, my BTC is only worth about 400$ right now, how much do you think the fee will be? also how do you back up the seed?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:02:37
is it better to choose a standard seed type or a segwit seed?
