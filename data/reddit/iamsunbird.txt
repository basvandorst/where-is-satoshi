Just like a stock, the gain is unrealized until you sell. So, if you hold the coins, there are no tax consequences. When you sell, you pay capital gains on the difference between the amount you spent when you bought the coins and the amount you gained when you sold.

A _competent_ company would have insurance. But then,a competent company would not blame the Bitcoin protocol for a flaw in their internal software. 
Additionally, given the novelty and volatility of Bitcoin, it would probably be difficult to get an insurance company on board.

This is really a site improvement! Because they figured out that there's a flaw in html that causes actual content to make your webpages load slower. But don't worry, the designers of the html protocol are working to fix the problem!

Good luck with that.

You should probably make sure you are accurately reporting any sales of btc or be prepared for an audit.

I stand corrected.

Anyone who invested their "life savings" into btc, or any volatile asset, is very foolish.

I wish I could say that this is the first time I've heard of a visa officer refusing to look at documentation flatly refuting the factual basis for a denial. Unfortunately, it happens all the time. It is infuriating. 
My guess is that they are using 214(b) as a pretext, when in fact their actual concerns are with either the prior conviction (even though not one that would bar your admission) or the renunciation (even if they have no proof that you did it for tax purposes). 
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:19:10
It is definitely possible to renounce without incurring permanent exclusion, it just must be done carefully. But when there are [published articles]( where you are proclaiming that people should renounce to come to a tax free paradise, you might encounter problems. Even if the embassy officials say there is a different reason (I.e. lack of ties outside the US, as here), they may be using that as a pretext for denial.
Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to challenge such denials, in part due to the doctrine of "consular nonreviewability," which is as bad as it sounds. There is a case slated for argument this term at SCOTUS regarding the concept called [Kerry v. Din](

As an immigration lawyer, I am wondering if we are getting the full picture here. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits issuance of a visa to an individual who 


[INA 212(a)(10)(E), 8 USC 1182(a)(10)(E)](
He posted a generic letter from the embassy about the requirement of nonimmigrant intent under INA 214(b), but he did not post the actual visa denial letter, which would state the specific grounds on which his visa was denied.
If he renounced in order to avoid paying taxes, he isn't likely going to get a visa to return here.
And note, this would apply regardless of which passport he has. He will not be eligible to use the visa waiver program because he has had a visa denial. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:54:43
Yes, in fact other subsections of the statute he was convicted of violating constitute "aggravated felonies" under the immigration laws. See [INA 101(a)(43)(i)](  But even where the individual is not convicted of a relevant offense, the visa officers have wide discretion to deny cases. And, in my experience, they sometimes use 214(b) (the "non immigrant intent" requirement) as a pretext.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:01:06
Yeah, they definitely have to prove that your intent was to avoid taxation. But there does appear to be [some basis]( for believing that he might have had such an intent. It is his burden to prove visa eligibility.

Bitcoin creates an attack vector for the deterministic and stealthy
man-in-the-middle attacks. A low-resource attacker can gain full
control of information flows between all users who chose to use
Bitcoin over Tor. In particular the attacker can link together
user’s transactions regardless of pseudonyms used, control which
Bitcoin blocks and transactions are relayed to the user and can
delay or discard user’s transactions and blocks. In collusion with
a powerful miner double-spending attacks become possible and
a totally virtual Bitcoin reality can be created for such set of
users. Moreover, we show how an attacker can fingerprint users
and then recognize them and learn their IP address when they
decide to connect to the Bitcoin network directly.

Haha, yeah, although note some judges and academics are using the term "non citizen" instead, including Sotomayor.

No idea. I don't know how Electrum works, but it seems that the problem in part arises from the bitcoin protocol's blacklisting of bad nodes if they send malformed data. If Electrum does the same thing, it could be vulnerable. OTOH, for Electrum, you are already trusting the server that you configure to be your source for the blockchain. If that same server is the one that sends transactions, it would seem to be safer (at least, obviously, so long as that server is trusted).
