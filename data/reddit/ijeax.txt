Care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:47:05
Any links to backup this claim or anything? If so, I'm getting my parents to purchase a bunch and I may go drop $500 on one BTC. How much is it looking to increase by?
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:40:53
What's worse is knowing about Bitcoin back then, buying some and spending it. I almost want to unsubscribe because every time I see a bitcoin post, it reminds me of the time I had 40BTC and spent it on dumb shit. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:51:48
You have anger management issues bud. Seriously, get some help. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:06:54
*sigh* I'm going to cry. $8000 is a lot of money and in 5 years or so it could be hundreds of thousands. FUCK :( 
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:04:25
I tried pywallet.. Tried to "recover" the files but it wasn't working. Either that or I wasn't doing it properly. When I open it in notepad it looks like this 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:48:26
I did it and got this error.
ERROR:root: Couldn't open wallet.dat/main. Try quitting bitcoins and running this again. 
Bitcoins isn't running and I checked my processes to be sure and it's not in their. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:32:31
I had 40BTC a year ago and guess what happened? I spent most of it and lost about 10K in a deleted wallet file. Now I have less than 1/10th of a bitcoin. I kick myself in the balls every day thinking what could have been. I just want to retire my fucking parents man.. They work so hard.

Ha. God no man. Running Windows 7.. On my parents shitty computer because I got rid of my beast rig which had Windows 8 and Mac OSX on it :/ and thanks for the link!
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:20:35
Looks like I'm making an hour trip to Vancouver. Thank you for your help :) 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:58:51
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:26:39
is this.. legit? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:34:03
Now do I just open a command prompt and enter that line? Replacing the passphrase and datadir line with my stuff of course. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:20:14
Yeah that's what I did.. I got a paper wallet, went to the bank and put it into a safe deposit box. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:21:03
I'd understand if it was constant threads about people missing out on teeny bits of money. But this is $8000 we're talking here right? If people don't like seeing the threads then they shouldn't respond and just move on. But anyways, I appreciate your attempt at helping me man! 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:45:08
And judging from all of your posts, and how you treat/talk to people, you really are a Shit Brick. Go be a douchebag on another website. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:59:46
Awesome! Now what do you think is a better idea? Buying from Cavirtex or going to the Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver and sending the coins to my paper wallet through the atm? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:36:04
Yeah I started clicking them and they won't send me to a place to download it -.- fml. Thanks though man! 
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:47:05
Thanks for your reply. How are you able to transfer BTC out of Cavirtex into a paper wallet? Does it give you an option to send BTC to a bitcoin address? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:43:23
Sorry, I don't sit on my ass and stare at the Bitcoinity all day. I tried to look through the highest rated topics and didn't see it posted so I thought maybe it just happened, asshole. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:02:33
*bang* You're dead. No Bitcoins for you. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:18:57
Wow. You've got a little gold mine there my friend! Congrats to you :) 
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:38:03
Sweet. I'll repay you in Walnuts &lt;3 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:33:38
Like you said, there is no sure answer. You could put $500 into it and get 0.5BTC and in a year that half a BTC could be worth $5 or it could be worth $5000+ 
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:04:51
I have another question, and I don't want to open up another thread for this so maybe you can help. 
The Bitcoin-QT Client has like 32,000+ blocks to download and its been downloading for like two days now. Is there anything else I can use, maybe a mobile app instead? I have an android, and I want to be able to purchase BTC asap and not have to worry about using my shitty computer. 
Also, can you purchase decimals of BTC on Cavirtex? I don't exactly have enough $$ for one full BTC at the moment and instead I'm looking to just put small amounts of $$ into BTC every few weeks or so and have it build up over time. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:30:06
Thank you for your reply, I appreciate your help. I will use the search next time, I didn't even know Reddit had one. Still lots to learn on here! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:08:31
and what's your regular dollar amount? and how often? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:25:31
I am in Vancouver, and I heard about the ATM as well. So, I should be able to purchase BTC directly from the ATM? Do you know how it works? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:28:39
Sorry, I'm quite new to Reddit. Just been a long time lurker and just starting to post. Your reply however, was not needed. Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:56:53
You're wanting to sell 500BTC to one single person for $600 each? Damn.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:44:01
Thanks :) 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:03:15
I moved it from there and into my "Everything" folder.. I can't remember why, I was doing something at the time lol :P 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:42:09
Lol you know, I don't really know, just kinda happens. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:23:35
Don't even apologize to that douchebag. Literally 90% of his posts he's calling someone an idiot or complaining about them not using the search. He has no room to complain when all he does is shit post. :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:57:42
That's what lazy people say. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:32:13
Same! I'm worried about using a client because of viruses etcetc and paper wallet because the risk of losing the paper or getting it stolen. Especially since some people will be holding onto their BTC for a few years. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:27:22
"wallet.dat corrupt salvage failed"
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:05:11
thank you. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:16:59
I honestly can't believe shit like this. You don't need to whore yourself out on the internet to a bunch of pervs to make money to give your daughter a good Christmas. You work your fucking ass off, get a good job and give her the life you want her to have, the one she deserves. 
And how do we know you aren't just making this up and using it as an excuse to make money? You could be bullshitting us. I will say you have a nice body though 10/10. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:50:17
you'll be sorry. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:48:41
Thank you! :) 
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:24:18
It's a good idea. But it would have to be done by someone trusted. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:08:38
I'd rather not use the ATM's paper wallet and risk losing it or something. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure there is a way to type in a bitcoin address on the ATM and get it to send the bitcoins to your paperwallet whether it be bitcoin-qt, electrum etcetc. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:55:40
Now I get 
WARNING:root:pycrypto or libssl not found, decryption may be slow 'ecdsa' package is not installed, pywallet won't be able to sign/verify messages.
along with the original error about quitting bitcoins below it. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:21:21
I'm extremely computer illiterate when it comes with command prompts and stuff. Like how do I even open the command line? Now you can see where I'm coming from and why I need someone to explain it step by step haha. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:40:55
check craigslist 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:43:35
No, it really wasn't. Maybe say it in a nicer way next time. Here try this with me "Hey, you may be new to Reddit, we have a search function that is located here. This has been answered before so if you search, you'll find it! :)" Wasn't that easy? Next time don't be a jackass. Got it? Good. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:02:29
No dice :/
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:02:36
Thanks, I'll give it a try! 
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:17:12
Yeah.. I deleted them awhile ago when Bitcoin wasn't worth much and I didn't care about it anymore. STUPID STUPID STUPID! 
I'm actually able to right click the files and recover the wallets, and open them in notepad and they look like actual wallets with the cryptic code and what not but they won't open in Bitcoin QT, I get an error and I've tried to use pywallet but that was no help. 
What is swap space though? I've never heard of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:26:07
Have a link to an older version of bitcoin-qt? I'm running the most recent one. How would I be able to swap space? Is there a tutorial somewhere? Thanks for you replies. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:02:00
Actually no! I had just installed the first plugin and thought that was all I needed. I misread and see that there is one more plugin to download. I'll check it out and let you know what happens! :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:42:08
how do you expect anyone to see that when it's on your head. and your graduation won't be on national tv so it's completely pointless. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:48:28
Thank you sir, hopefully they'll understand now. A lot of them are computer/internet illiterate and I'm not that great at explaining this kind of stuff. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:00:00
Lol. Him sending you 250 bitcoins first before any payment isn't you taking full risk. it's him. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:50:01
Congrats! :) I'm going to buy mine this week hopefully at the ATM in Vancouver. I had 40BTC over a year ago but spent them lol.. I'm kicking myself in the balls over that fml. Anyways to the moon we go! :)
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:12:56
I'm so confused.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:52:01
Damn. That was very thorough, I appreciate the time you took to write that. Thank you.
