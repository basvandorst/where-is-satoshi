I don't know, but most likely, Coinbase was contacted by the SPLC, an extremely biased left-wing organization that has been pressuring all big tech companies in Silicon Valley to cut off business with "hate groups".
What's a "hate group?" Very subjective, basically anyone the left doesn't like. Lots of ordinary conservatives have been labelled a hate group by the SPLC.
The SPLC probably cherry picked the nastiest 1/10,000 comments on Gab and sent them to Coinbase saying, "look, this site is full of nazis, you have to ban it!". And Coinbase, being in Silicon Valley, is probably staffed mostly by people on the far left, who ideologically agree with the SPLC.

Gab: "The right to openly discuss ideas must be defended"
DuderMcBrosonthal:  "Fuck off nazi scum!"
The far-left is using nazi as an excuse to censor 10,000's, if not millions, of ordinary conservatives who believe in free speech.

That's awful, you should report that.
The vast majority of people on Gab are not like that. And some of the people who post that content are far-left activists who create accounts, post death threats, and then immediately report their own comments to the FBI, to try and get Gab shut down.
By the way, it's easy to find the same on Twitter and Facebook. Far left groups that say things like "kill all white men", "kill the bourgeoisie",  "punch nazis / fascists (when referring to mainstream right wingers like Ben Shaprio, who's a Jew by the way)".  Should Facebook and Twitter get cut off from their banks and payment processors because people on the far left make death threats and inappropriate content?

You're ignoring the big picture. What's happening is exactly what I described.
The entire ecosystem of big tech corporations are slowly strangling conservatives. Facebook and Google are downranking conservative news sites.  Paypal, and now Coinbase, are slowly banning conservatives from their platforms. The same with Twitter, and Facebook.  And Apple and Google have banned Gab's app.
If you get downranked on search engines, cut off from your funding, banned from social media, how can you survive?  Your reach will be 1/100 or 1/1000 what it would have been had these corporations not conspired against you.
Does free speech really matter if no one can find what you say?

Let me just cut off your access to your bank account, and kick you off facebook and twitter, and downrank the news sites you report your story to on Google.  No one will ever hear or know about you, but at least you have free speech right?

From Wikipedia:  
Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or "inconvenient" as determined by government authorities or by community consensus. Governments and private organizations may engage in censorship.

No it's not.  There are plently of people on there I don't like.  But there are also many more ordinary people.
And in terms of actual nazis who want to execute people based on their race, hardly any. Threats of violence and terrorism aren't allowed on Gab (the legal limits of free speech).

While in theory I agree with you, in practice, most big tech companies are located in Silicon Valley, staffed by people on the far left. They pretty much all act in unison when it comes to political matters.
Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. have been heavily censoring "hate speech".
What's hate speech? Very subjective, basically whatever the far left doesn't like. (and of course, left-wing hate speech is allowed).
What are you supposed to do when Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, Paypal, Coinbase, ban you?  Just go build your own payment processor?
It's not that easy. Network effects and regulation start-up costs make this almost impossible.

Doubtful. The SPLC, an extremely biased left-wing organization, has been pressuring all big tech companies in Silicon Valley to cut off business with "hate groups".

I'm not talking about banning individual accounts, I'm talking about banning entire platforms with 100,000's of people on them.  Should Facebook and Twitter themselves get cut off from their bank accounts because people on the far left make death threats and inappropriate content?
