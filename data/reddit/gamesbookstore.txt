Lol Circle. These guys are pretty much anti bitcoin by now, and are only using this opportunity to make bitcoin look bad. So yeah, don't use them, regardless of hardfork or softfork or nofork or whatever.
And exchanges are very likely better suited to handle any of this than 99.9% of the people here. That's if it even matters, because the chance of there ever being two chains with value is like zero. The bitcoins with value will survice, and no exchange is going to lose them (except maybe Circle). So just calm the fuck down.

It's actually exactly the other way around: I am the level headed pragmatic one who does not get all panicky because someone uttered the word hardfork. I know exactly what that word entails, and I know exactly that nothing happens to any bitcoins that are just being left the fuck alone. And I also know that there is no reason to expect exchanges to mess up in any way, as they're perfectly capable of handling this, and are obviously well prepared. Except Circle. Fuck Circle.

Hey, I'm on an apologizing spree before calling it a night. You're probably not an idiot.
It's just that the reason so many bitcoin users are so confused about what to do now that everyone is talking about this scary hardfork thing, is because everyone is giving bad advice by overly complicating things.
It's really simple: nothing happens to anyone's bitcoins, and if you don't trust your exchange to handle this correctly, you shouldn't have had your bitcoins on there in the first place.
Good night.
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:37:03
Bitcoin is very different from Ethereum in many ways. There most likely won't be a fork at all, and if there is, there most definitely won't be two surviving chains that both have value. That's simply not how this works. Ethereum existed in a speculative vacuum. There was (and still is) pretty much no ecosystem of businesses and users behind it. It's all on exchanges. Bitcoin. Is. Different!

There is no p2p decentralized currency that is able to serve the unbanked. Doing so will need second layer solutions. It would be nice if we could just snap our fingers and solve all the problems in the world, but sometimes it takes a bit more than that.
Bitcoin's primary value proposition is being sound money embedded in a trustless and highly secure value transfer system. Everything else can and will be built on top of that. But if we destroy this foundation, everything else falls apart as well. It's paramount to protect Bitcoin's integrity and with it its fundamental value! Don't risk this for a noble but misguided dream.

There is no power saving. Increasing power efficiency only makes the existing ASICs more profitable, which means miners will add more of these ASICs until they're back at their same marginal profit point they were at before. What's so hard to understand about this?
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:05:28
Actually, now that I think about it some more, new mining hardware investment isn't even necessary in the case of a uniform efficiency gain, because the difficulty adjustment would indeed take care of all of it. Mining investment would only be used to compensate if the efficiency gain isn't uniform among all miners, because then the more efficient hardware would push out the less efficient one (once again adding to more centralization).
There, we solved it (well I did).
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:56:46
Peter Todd likes being a drama queen. As others have pointed out, the probability of this being exploitable as a remote code execution is low. If that would be possible however, then yes, affected miners need to take action asap. 
That said, I doubt big mining operations even connect their mining hardware directly to the internet. There's no reason to do that. Just connect it to your own separate nodes, firewalled or NATed or whatever. This seems an obvious thing to do even without this revelation. If miners are already doing that, then this thing is pretty much toothless.

All miners operate at their marginal profitability. Their marginal profitability doesn't change with more efficient hardware. Therefore the distribution of hashpower will stay the same. I can't make it any simpler than that for you, sorry.

Wow! One of the largest miners does apparently not understand how mining secures the Bitcoin network! The hashrate number is completely arbitrary and irrelevant. The only thing that makes Bitcoin secure is the energy consumption (and the cost associated with it). I'm speechless!

@_date: 2017-04-07 15:48:10
Are you even trying to understand? Or just repeating the same thing?
Any sudden efficiency gain in mining hardware will be compensated by more mining hardware being added, and the distribution of that hardware follows the same marginal profit rules as all the other hardware before it. The result will be the same total level of energy consumption and the same distribution of hashpower. And if the mining market is unable to react quickly enough, then the difficulty adjustment will do the rest.
If anything, asicboost would put Bitmain in an even stronger position of power, because they control so much of the mining hardware market.

By lowering power consumption, big miners will simply compensate by increasing the number of ASICs, because they are now more profitable. In the end, the total power consumption of the network would settle at the same level as before, for the simple reason that cost of power consumption follows the value of the mining reward. 
The GH number itself is just a number. It has no meaning in terms of security.

No. All that matters is the cost of mining, nothing else. And that cost is defined by the power consumption (and yes of course hardware cost, but that's not the point here). Saying that increasing the hashrate while decreasing energy consumption would improve the security of the network shows a complete failure of understanding. It's unbelievable to read this from Bitmain. You on the other hand are just some silly redditor, so you shall be excused for your ignorance.

UTXO inputs need to be signed each one, even if they're from the same address. Having them on the same address doesn't change anything regarding transaction size.

@_date: 2017-05-08 19:54:32
There's currently a stickied thread here which links to this: 
Why are fees important? Because miners can only include a limited amount of transactions in each block (block space is limited), so they will prioritize the ones that pay the highest fee relative to the size they use up (more complex transactions are larger).
Your wallet should handle fee calculation for you. If it doesn't, you need to update or change wallets.

I don't see anything wrong with that transaction. Looks like you just got unlucky with your timing, and demand for transactions picked up before yours get confirmed. Wallets unfortunately can't anticipate what happens after you sent your transaction. That's where RBF and CPFP come in. I'm not sure whether Mycelium has support for these yet though.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:13:06
Don't create tiny change outputs like that, it will only make getting the transaction confirmed more difficult, because many nodes won't relay it. Add any tiny leftover amounts to the fee instead.
If you had no control over this process in your wallet, submit feedback to the wallet dev with reference to this transaction.
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:26:38

Rebroadcasting isn't necessary, as propagation across the network is not the issue here. 
It's really too bad that Mycelium won't let you bump the fee with a CPFP transaction. No idea what their criteria are to determine whether this is "necessary" or not. I feel like this should be a user choice.
Maybe the best thing you can do at this point is give feedback to the Mycelium devs about this issue.
If it's *really* time critical, you could try exporting the private key of your change address, and create a CPFP transaction with a different wallet or manually with  for example. But again I'm not sure whether Mycelium even lets you export private keys for specific addresses. Probably not, as mobile wallets are usually quite restrictive.

Guessing confirmation times and necessary fees is a fool's errand at this point, as it's impossible to predict the amount of new transaction and their fees after you submit your transaction.
So until miners stop being selfish assholes and start supporting Segwit, your best bet is to use a wallet that lets you send RBF enabled transactions. With an RBF transaction you can change the fee after you sent it, based on how network load has changed in the meantime.

I don't know of a good how-to. But it's really simple: you send an unconfirmed output (usually your change) of the stuck transaction with a high enough fee to make it worth it for miners to include both of your transactions, because their average fee/byte is now high enough.
Miners have to include both of your transactions because all transactions before the last one have to be confirmed in order for the last one to be confirmed as well.
To calculate the new fee you first decide on a fee amount (fees are always per byte) to which you want to raise the average of the two transactions. Then you take the size of your first transaction (in this case 224 bytes), add 200 bytes to it (the average size of a single input/single output transaction), multiply that by your targeted average fee, and finally subtract the fee you already paid in the first transaction.
As an example:
Target fee = 390 sat/byte  
Combined size of the two transactions = 224 bytes + 200 bytes = 424 bytes  
Combined fees you need to pay = 424 * 390 sat = 165360 sat  
Fee that you need to add to your CPFP tx = 165360 sat - 54336 sat = 111024 sat = **0.00111024 btc**
To avoid this expensive double paying of fees in the future, make sure to use RBF instead.

True. Unless you're lying.

From what I know about these two individuals, my bet would be on neither of them being right.
@_date: 2017-05-02 12:50:27
That's definitely not a bad option.
Many experienced bitcoiners will tell you that you don't really own the bitcoins unless you "control the private keys", which means sending the bitcoins to your own wallet. But it's perfectly fine to leave them on Coinbase until you familiarize yourself with everything.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:22:41
Electrum would work: 
Many wallets actually "sweep" a private key instead of importing it, which is not what you'd want. 
Anyway, as you'd only create a single CPFP transaction, you could also use  to create a single transaction with that key, and send it back to your mycelium wallet with that transaction.
The important part when doing a CPFP transaction is calculating the necessary fee to pay for *both* transactions, the stuck one and the new one.
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:30:38
If it lets you export the private key of the change address you could import it into a different wallet. But definitely easier to wait if you're not in a hurry, 120 sat/B should get confirmed eventually.

@_date: 2017-05-16 18:13:32
It is a bit strange. It looks like you've been right at the cut-off amount, but on the wrong side every time. As I said, most likely just really unlucky timing, but of course that doesn't really help you.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:07:48
The transaction will at some point be dropped by all the nodes, and it will be as if you never sent it. Unless you sent it with a wallet that auto-rebroadcasts your transaction periodically, but most shouldn't do that.
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:55:37
Plot twist: the transactions were sending to cold storage.

Nothing wrong with doing it like that. Just remember that the more convoluted you make it, the easier it is for you to mess up somewhere and lose access to your seed yourself.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:00:48
You need to change the path for the data folder to the new location. 
You can do this either in the GUI under settings, in the [Bitcoin.conf]( configuration file (add the line `datadir=&lt;dir&gt; `), or as a startup argument (add `-datadir=&lt;dir&gt;`).

I think you're misinterpreting Maxwell's comment. His official assessment of BIP148 is still that it's [deficient]( (= okay with the idea, but considers it to have insufficient community support).

One of the biggest tricks the police state pulled of is making ordinary people submit to self-censorship and other forms of voluntary compliance, because they're afraid of getting on some list.

If you want to be a little bit more paranoid about it, create your Electrum wallet seed from a Tails live CD (it already comes with Electrum installed). 
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:39:25
Yes about the nlocktime question.
But I don't know where you could find an example for  a CLTV tx. It's not very widely used in normal transactions. You could try asking in  on irc.freenode.net, a lot of devs hang out there.

What are you worried about exactly? I see no problem with keeping it on an exchange (other than the usual counterparty risks that always apply of course).
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:35:56


That address only received 14.61 bitcoins in total. Nobody sent 254 bitcoins to it. The 254 btc transaction is an outgoing transaction that consolidates funds from a ton of addresses, which comes to a total of 254 btc. Whether any of these are also from scam victims or not is anyone's guess.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:29:25
The reason d'être for "cryptocurrency" is to be a dencentralized, censorship resistant, immutable and open form of sound money. Bitcoin fills this niche almost perfectly. Everything else are gimmicks, niches within the niche, and in the case of the bigger altcoins mostly marketing devices to convince naive buyers that there is more to the pump than hot air. And if it's more than a gimmick, then it will find its way into Bitcoin in some form or another in time.

Yeah, it's actually so not useful, barely anyone is using it right now. 
Sometimes I wonder if people like you really are that stupid, or if this is just part of pumping up your little balloons. Eh, why not both?
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:25:10
Neither. Transactions with an nlocktime value in the future are rejected by the network as invalid, and are not relayed by any nodes. Only once the nlocktime is reached do these transactions become valid and can be broadcasted successfully.
Edit: In case you're talking about checklocktimeverify, then yes, these transactions are mined immediately, but the outputs can only be spent again once the checklocktime expires. So in that case it would be a yes to your second question.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:10:41
There won't be "two currencies". Don't fall for the FUD.

Unfortunately we didn't account for inflation via altcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:57:59
Now the question that really matters is: has this increase in hashrate strengthened or weakened miner decentralization? A very steep rise like that makes me suspect it's the latter.

Always the same stupid drivel. I really can't be bothered anymore to address this crap every time.
No, fast and cheap transactions are not why Bitcoin exists. Not at all. Fast and cheap transactions are the perfect example of a second layer application, aka Lightning Network.
No, Bitcoin doesn't need to be able to "change itself very fast". Exactly the opposite. It needs to resist change as much as possible. Sound money doesn't need to adapt and evolve on a whim, or when some kind of council or foundation decides that it's necessary. Sound money needs to have a set of core properties, and it needs to protect these core properties at all cost. That's exactly what Bitcoin is doing right now.
But you wouldn't understand, and that's okay. Not everyone needs to understand. Just go back to pumping hot air in your balloon.
