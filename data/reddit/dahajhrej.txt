When Apple stock hit its all-time high, did the entire public go out and pour money into Apple stock? There's your answer.
99.999% of people in the mass public don't care about the price at all.

First file is bitcoin / src / main.cpp. Feel free to correct me and guide me during this process. I know pretty much shit about coding. Yes, this might be completely inane but I am going to take that risk.
Let's start with these 
\ "alert.h"
\ "checkpoints.h"
\ "db.h"
\ "net.h"
\ "init.h"
\ "ui_interface.h"

There's so much wrong with this that I don't even know where to start.


Why would you do this? This is a terrible way of determining usefulness.


You would be wrong. Not only would more people worldwide prefer to receive HUF and/or LBP than bitcoins, nearly 100% of people in Hungary would prefer HUF and nearly 100% of people in Lebanon would prefer to receive LBP.




This is a false dilemma. If you owe me money and we are both in the US, I can force you to pay me in USD. Other countries have similar laws. This is called "legal tender."

Imagine you're a regular reader of a mainstream financial site. Now imagine that no matter what the particular topic, the comments of every article are swarming with bitcoiners trying to convert people, and who go nuclear on anyone who disagrees.
How is that any different? Moreover, do you see how the latter breeds the former?
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:47:46
I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion from this post. Maybe try rereading the post to better comprehend it.

This thread and your previous comment are both about the US. It's a little too late to be playing the "non-American" card.

If they were to do any such thing, the public backlash would be tremendous. People might even file lawsuits.

What relation are you to Rudd-O? Are you the new model of Rudd? Are you stronger, faster, better, more badass, dumber, etc.? What's the deal, man?
Now that I think about it, the Terminator-X wasn't exactly the best Terminator model.

a) Juvenile things like this never win people to your cause. 
b) Krugman's quote about the internet was not serious. This is extremely obvious when you read the entire article in which it was posted. Quoting him out of context makes *you* look foolish, not him.
So you're a juvenile fool. And you wonder why the general public has no desire to get involved in any of this.

You have no idea what you're talking about. There are two (2) very active threads mocking bitcoiners on SA at this very moment.

"State lines" means the borders between individual states in the US. For the most part, each state is responsible for enforcing their own laws within their own boundaries. But that creates a problem when the criminal is in a different state than the person whom the crime was committed against (or if the criminal is in a different country entirely). 
In those cases, the federal government kicks both states to the curb and handles the matter themselves. This usually involves the FBI. The federal government doesn't like having to spend resources on that sort of thing so if you were to do such a thing, you will not like what happens when Big Daddy takes off his belt.
Edit: Certain specific crimes (like bank robbery) are *always* considered to cross state lines, even if a specific bank robbery actually doesn't. Thus, in the US, *all* bank robberies are investigated by the FBI. Local law enforcement is never allowed to touch a bank robbery case other than as "first responders" when people's lives are in danger. Then once the physical danger has passed, the FBI boots local law enforcement out.

Private companies *should* be able to tell people how they are permitted to use that company's services. If Circle sued them, they *would* get crushed because Circle would be in the wrong.

Uh, no. There are "ambulance chaser" lawyers who'll try to get literally anyone to file a lawsuit over literally anything. These lawyers spend 100% of their time on stupid stuff. It doesn't matter to them if they actually *win* the case since they'll be taking the client's money anyway.

The problem is that most people aren't too lazy to input their credit card number. They're also far less likely to get ripped off by doing so, seeing how shady the site you used is. Have fun getting your Steam account permabanned, I guess.

You don't seem to be understanding why they're doing this. They want the WoW economy to be a closed system with Blizzard essentially playing the role of the Federal Reserve. If they opened the economy, the economy would quickly become disastrous. This has happened in many, many MMOs before this.

He is right, even if most of us don't want to admit it. I think it's refreshing that a core dev isn't willing to deny real problems that the rest of us would prefer not to admit to.

Doing such a thing would completely defeat the entire reason to create a local currency. Don't do that.

This is bitcoin, after all, so what's probably going on here is that this guy noticed that firewood keeps getting dumped in a particular spot and figured out a clever scheme to get people to give him bitcoins.
If you actually think this guy is the same person dropping that wood, I don't know what to tell you.
