Well, the idea is actually to externalize that volatility with BitReserve, using Bitcoin just as a vehicle for money transmission (avoiding possible confiscations, or a devaluation of your savings), not to invest on it. You can basically invest on almost every currency and commodity at no cost following that steps, and cash-them out in a more than simple way. :)

Taking measures to secure your savings is inmoral?. What´s the difference between doing this, or buying gold and store it under your garden? This just makes the process easy, and allows your savings to be allways with you.

You´re completely right. :)

The article is focused on Spain. If BitReserve, based in the US, is the one who holds your money, how could the Spanish Government seize your savings?.

The purpose is just to hold the value of your savings in terms of another asset, as Gold, but without having to buy physical gold. You don´t buy Bitcoins to hold that savings in Bitcoins, but to hold them in virtual Gold, in this case, not giving the spanish government the chance to seize them.

Very interesting, but sounds not accesible for the average user. Didn´t know about it. 
Thank you for the information!
