Yeah the accounting side of things would be the tough part.. also, what would your prices be? Would you set prices in BTC, or would you grab an exchange rate every time someone wants to pay with BTC? You might have to report capital gains some days if you convert to CAD at the end of each day ($200 increase means it has to be taxed as a capital gain).
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:12:06
Ah I see, so if you were dealing with a scumbag they might dick you

Can I mine Monero with an average computer on Windows ? Haha I'm no programmer here I make beer for a living 
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:38:37
Hmm would we see some kind of confirmation that the transaction has gone through though? Even if the funds didn't transfer right away? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:44:24
Any resources on how to diversify? I'm looking at btc eth and xmr right now, but any less established promising coins that one should look into?
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:35:52
Eh, you can definitely lie to get things going and run a completely legitimate business. We definitely bent the truth when applying for loans, and wouldn't have been funded without those lies. We didn't expose our business to more risk in doing so, but we checked off some of the bank's requirements in doing so. We now run a successful business that has been profitable since day 1 of operations.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:52:35
Ah so it's a joke.. so I should buy Monero.. only problem is I don't know how to get onto an exchange that I can buy it on. I'm only signed up with quadrigacx and coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:41:46
More fud just means more people are hearing about btc. Btc will only keep rising if more people hear about it..
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:38:48
I'm certainly not sure, I just have no idea how I would do that. It seems like it would be quite confusing accepting it as we would cash, no? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:29:55
The less fungible bitcoin becomes, the worse it will be in the long term. If the masses need to get on board for bitcoin to continue to grow, having different configurations of this so-called currency is going to turn people off really fast. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:50:49
I know the 0.2 btc value is fairly arbitary, but if it were that high, that would be far too large for a small business such as mine. On a busy day, we sell about $3,000, and I'd imagine less than 2% of our payments would be received in Bitcoin. That would take us over a month to get a payout.
I mean, maybe this isn't going to be something that is useful for small business but just saying..
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:59:25
As someone who is about to buy btc, but am waiting for my ledger to arrive before i do because i don't want to leave it on an exchange.. am I able to put my coin into segwit right off the bat? Are there things I should know about making my first purchase before doing so?
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:49:42
It would be diversifying the goals of our business, though it is much riskier than our current business. I'm happy to take the risk personally, but maybe not so much as a business (we are a microbrewery). Hm so you're saying that essentially the sale would be based on the value of goods sold (in FIAT), regardless of the BTC value. How would you determine the amount of BTC required to pay for items though? Would you just have a set amount of BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:31:20
Ah gotcha. Where do you find the transfer fees? I have the Monero gui but nothing for btc or eth yet, just a small amount (about 8% of my intended investment) in exchange which I intend to move to a ledger nano s this evening.
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:31:53
The risk i mean just being in that some of our business capital will be tied up in crypto which in itself is risky. The risk of losing the money I'm alright to lose personally is certainly a risk, but something I can justify. The risk of our business not being able to pay the bills and potentially going under is a much bigger risk. This is of course completely dependent on how much money we keep in the btc wallet.
Edit;  with that said I would definitely like to implement this in some capacity. I just need to get educated as much as possible.
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:08:33
Aw man, Bill was there ?
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:26:07
Gotcha. Even if I were just to accept bitcoin directly without a POS like said?
The accounting does sound like it would be a nightmare as then we'd just have a bitcoin wallet that we would have to reconcile with our sales each day, which wouldn't add up because the value wouldn't match by the time we convert to CAD. Our software would track everything in CAD and we'd basically have to group all of the BTC transactions and scale them with the difference (via discount / price increase).. yeah I have no idea how we would do this..
Maybe waiting for the LN is the best strategy here.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:53:48
Fees for setting it up? Or individual transactions? Or what?
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:55:50
I'm sure it's fairly obvious but if I buy btc on an exchange that I'm already verified on, is it easier to buy other crypto once I have btc? Or will I have to go through the same sort of verification still?
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:46:38
I've heard varying things about Monero, some say it's the next best thing to put your money in after bitcoin, some say to stay away from it. Obviously these two sides place different value on different aspects. What's your take on it? Why would you say not to buy it? Not antagonizing you, just wanting to hear people's thoughts.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:33:29
Yes but is this a good thing or a bad thing (in terms of potential value). Obviously for illegal activity, this makes it a better option. I'm not after crypto for illegal activity but I am in it for making money. Would this anonymity/privacy prove lucrative over time? Or would the increased regulations set by governments make a coin like this obsolete?
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:01:13
Hm damn, we use Chase and it seems they aren't integrated. We also have a contract with them for a while.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:23:05
I'm looking to get in soon, but am not sure what the best way to store my coin is. Is just a paper-written wallet the best? Can I just store in a spreadsheet on a USB key or something? Or am I best to buy a device that holds them? I don't want to leave them in an exchange as that just seems unnecessarily risky.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:47:17
 That's true. I think the is good reason to believe that making the currency more versatile will be better long term.  
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:46:35
I was in Hawaii when that happened.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:50:41
Ah, sorry didn't see this before my previous response to your other comment. I'm quite uneducated on transactions but I'm trying to learn so thanks for the info, much appreciated!
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:08:35
Cool yeah I should certainly think about how I want to diversify as I get into some crypto in the next couple days. How do you figure the best way for me to get Monero would be? I am on quadriga where I can buy eth and btc. What exchange/pairing is best to get into Monero you think?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:28:02
I have two questions. 
* What is the best exchange to purchase bitcoin (and ethereum?) on in Canada. If that is a 'it depends' answer, I'm looking to put in ~$2,000 and leave it for a while. I want to have my assets as protected as possible (private wallet?)
* Is there a ELI5 / super beginner guide to understanding how to purchase bitcoin? I tried to look into it a couple months back (when it was at $6,000 USD, damnit!) but the hurdle seemed overwhelming and without knowing a ton about it, I thought it can't go up too fast being at such a high price with such a crazy climb recently. I want to get some money in and I have some disposable cash right now so I think it's a good time..
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:09
It's gambling for sure, with no known odds or ROI. Like the sticky on the front page states, if you are comfortable with 50% of your wealth being in BTC, but you put 50% in and the rise has now made it 90%, it's probably a good idea to redistribute to make that 50% again (unless you, at that point, are comfortable having a higher percentage in BTC).
The whole 'hold on forever' mentality is what leads to a shitload of heartbreak if there is ever a massive crash. If there isn't a massive crash though, it'll lead to a lot of people getting super rich!
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:43:57
I'm just saying that making bold baseless predictions in opposition to people making baseless bold predictions doesn't make you any better. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:02:14
Too small for its current exchange. If you want it to stick around, you're going to have to replace it if btc increases by another 10x or 100x... 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:48:25
Hmm.. I was looking into Coinbase and it looked extremely difficult to get your coin out? Or was I just not understanding? I live in a fairly small town so exchanging in person might not be the best option for me, I'd rather do it online. Coinbase still probably the way then?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:07:42
If you're not comparing it with anything, you are making assumptions on how it will do with no basis. Probably even worse than making incorrect comparisons.
@_date: 2018-10-28 03:10:00
The overall marketplace (all businesses) are impacted by costs. The final prices to customers have all of these things considered. If businesses all of a sudden had to pay 10c less for every transaction, would they lower all prices by 10c? Probably not, but as things evened out and competition forced businesses to compete with new guys, everything would even o ut with these considerations.
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:38:51
Many people have already been burned more than twice. This isnt the first crash. Historically when no one mentioning bitcoin usually means it is time to buy.
@_date: 2018-10-27 21:48:30
The thing you are missing is that vendors eat the fees that you aren't paying. Seems like you shouldn't care, right? Well many businesses have to consider every little detail to stay in business. If they didnt have to eat these fees, they wouldnt have to ultimately pass them on to customers through markup. Same way businesses consider rent, utilities, payroll, cogs, etc. Everything counts.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:24:27
Pretty sure you're comparing apples with opinions then, because there is nothing that you can really relate to BTC with any confidence.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:46:12
My only dilemma is... do I buy more now, or do I wait to see if it dips further???
Seems like a good price today, but trend is definitely bearish and nothing is signaling a quick turnaround. I know that a turnaround can happen instantly. Really in a tough place here!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:25:19
Haha if they drop more over the next couple weeks I may. I only put in 1/4 of what I'm ok with losing, keeping some back to buy potential deeper dips.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:30:32
Usually good community there!
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:32:14
Your argument is equally as poor to be fair. You're saying everyone has heard of bitcoin. First, that's not even true, and second, a TON of people have heard of it but haven't wanted to come even close to touching it. The more news circulating and the more of their friends buy it, the more likely they are to buy it. Not even to mention organizations getting involved as have been seen often recently. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:29:42

@_date: 2018-02-06 08:54:07
I'm hoping for bitcoin to start climbing again as everyone on this sub is.. but if $5.5k is the floor, and we dropped 22% to $6k in 24h, I'd be surprised. 
Just take a look at 6h candles right now -  for the last 2 days the trend is extremely consistent. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:01:58
Me before buying in.
*Oh god it's going down again I need to get in this is such a good opportunity I can ride the next bull run even if it drops more, it's still good to get in at this price*
Me 1 minute after buying in
*Oh god it's still going down what have I done all of crypto could bottom out and I could lose all my money*
I don't actually have all my money in BTC, only a portion of the amount I can afford to lose. I think I am fairly rational, but it's undeniable that this kind of volatility evokes a lot of emotional response!
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:26:59
I'll probably buy in a week if it keeps going down
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:38:18
Alright we'll see. May the best person win I suppose!
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:42:34
I doubt that's true. I'm sure a lot of people would have sold off for a loss with weak hands and I'm sure a lot of people got into it more recently and are at best even. I'm personally just about even but I've only just gotten into it in the last few weeks, but I'm looking to be holding long term. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:57:08
I mean that's not a great comparison- more like Netscape which was very prevalent for a long time and then got completely pushed out. If one coin stands alone in its technology and is widely considered the best to use and store value, I think it would overtake btc. Eth isn't better at those things necessarily and it already has a market cap approaching btc. I don't think either will necessarily be the end game. With that said I think both will continue to rise in the short-medium term (5years?). Just one dude's guess though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:03:36
Not the same chance. Holding you will remain with the same amount of coin. Trading you can easily lose. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:55:29
Wow, very hostile. You think that volatility isn't a function of market cap? It definitely plays a part. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:43:51
USD or not, the same thing could happen to your holdings.. Your method is sound anecdotally, but it ends there. If you're exclusively trading between two coins, trading every time there is a favorable inversion, eventually you will be holding one of the coins when it goes significantly lower in value relative to the other coin. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:55:18
Interesting analysis as has been all over this sub recently, but one thing that is a bit more worrisome that no one is mentioning, Bitcoin is in a fairly different state now in the market than it was 2013 and before.. the most analogous crashes haven't been recent. I'm not saying this means anything, I'm just saying that is a major difference that no one is mentioning.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:38:46
That's a pretty silly comment. Why people buy bitcoin is fairly irrelevant. We're analyzing a market where people are already buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:51:42
Of course some will grow, but with the amount of new coins coming out, it isn't a safe investment to invest in early coins..

I mean, I'm all for crypto, but if bitcoin actually uses 1/18th the energy that gold mining uses, that seems pretty bad. Gold you literally have to move mountains or dig massive pits to extract. Bitcoin is processing power. 
Also, not sure what kind of comparison you're using. Total gold mined vs total bitcoin mined? $ value of gold vs $ value of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:42:04

I mean the value is completely based on demand. Cant really say its overvalued when everyone wanted it. The value isnt linked to technology, other than the premise that without the technology there is no value in the first place. You can argue that mining determines the price as well, but you can just as easily say that mining is more of a reaction based on the demand.
