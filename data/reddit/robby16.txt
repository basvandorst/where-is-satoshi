No it won’t lol. Don’t underestimate banks and their power. They will evolve and adapt like a virus. If anything traditional banks will be replaced with crypto banks because of the underlying fact that people are too stupid and lazy to take care of their own money. They don’t want the responsibility and would rather shift it on the institution like a bank. Banks will offer the same service of storing your btc so you have “security” and insurance. The organised (elites, government, conglomerates) always win over the unorganised (plebs, peasants, majority).

The core devs are arrogant inbreds who don’t won’t to work with anyone. They have no clue how economics work business to business trade and international finance. They think they have all the power because of some code but they are totally wrong. Btc isn’t scaling. LN isn’t doing much and unless it does become digital gold, it might very easily be dethroned by projects with actual use case and business adoption. For a crypto currency to be successful and mass adopted, in needs to be able to work with everyone and everything but the core developers of BTC refuse that because like I said they are arrogant and fools.

I know what banks do and looks like you more of a anarchist than informed. Yes banks are a company and the main purpose is to make money by mortgage, lending and keeping your money “safe” with insurance providing a service is all part of their revenue. But how you suppose to buy a house or car for the average mum and dad? Where to get a loan? We need some sort of lending platform like Celsius’s Network or Debitum but they are just new banks. Banks are not gonna go away anytime soon mate. Don’t delude yourself.

Possible to go into btc but if it happened now? Yeh idk, 70% of people probably haven’t even heard of bitcoin and won’t touch it and those who have heard of it mostly think it’s a scam.

There are a few institutes that want in but atm it’s regulatory uncertainty on security tokens and custodians are not yet there that are reputable and all the red tape with paper work takes years sometimes. Institutes can’t make binance accounts as we know, they do things all with paper work and lawyers. I’d say within 15 months or so this will be ready and the market has a huge pump. But from what I been reading, September gonna be worse than August possible bounce October. The reason is many ETFs are gonna be rejected in my opinion and it just creates more fud since it’s soo important for the public haha. No clue what happens after that.
Good luck!

Lol your points are funny. Gold can be manipulated with fake elements. There could be an infinite supply for all we know there is apparently more gold in the ocean than there is on the surface and what about meteorites or other planets?There is no kill switch and things have value because we decide it has value. You cannot destroy or create BTC. Btc allows us to transport value like never seen in history and allows us to become totally financially independent from banks and their profit making at the expense of the economy. This is just the surface. Study the blockchain. I cbf explaining there is plenty of YouTube vids. Take a unbiased approach and study it. The world can’t make decisions based on what could happen. You’re telling me you’re not going to get a job because a meteorite could hit and destroy the planet? If there is an electromagnetic wave sorry I can’t finish that without laughing then everything is fucked anyway without the Internet the world is in darkness back to the Stone Age pretty much and gold has just as much use as bitcoin at that stage. The only things that have real value and will always have real value are the basics:  food, water, air and heat. Until that happens though this is going to revolutionise the Internet, business and life in general in the long term.

Ambition and balls than you? Not all business is run by sociopaths and even if it is that’s what it takes to get rich. The main reason counties are in debt is not because of banks but because people don’t know how to fkn manage their money and pay the bank back. No one forces you to buy into a ETF anyway. 99% of people suck with money and are clueless plebs. Btc won’t change that. Btc will not change the hierarchy of human civilisation and life. It’s it human DNA and some will always be on top of others and those will be called “sociopaths and greedy arrogant assholes” by little cry babies like you.

Here are the facts:
The VanEck/SolidX ETF the market cares so much about is merely a copy of a previous application.
 
There was another SolidX ETF proposal that was denied March 29th, 2017. The VanEck/SolidX ETF currently under review has exactly the same insurance and exactly the same custodian (SolidX.) For all intents and purposes, it is the same proposal just with some amendments to the registration.
 
Overall there aren’t that many changes from the application that was denied. Specifically, after the SEC letter with concerns/questions from January 18th, 2018, it seems like they didn’t do much to address those concerns.
 
I have read the application also, I think it’s sloppy and unfinished. There are brackets everywhere, and the OTC index it relies on is unfinished.
Those concerns could be somewhat alleviated before February of 2019, but I think it should be clear that the market is putting far too much faith and hope into this clearly flawed ETF.
Obviously biggest change is that VanEck’s name is on it and the CBOE is behind it as well. But in terms of changes they just added like 2 small paragraphs about VanEck’s role, likely just for “marketing”.
It would be good for price and mainstream attention but it’s not a holy grail and should not have tanked the price so much but this was a typical “buy the rumour, sell the news” hype just like consensus.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:14:51
The ETF was the rumour and the delay was the news. Even if it got accepted it would of tanked initially (most likely) then picked up fast.

Goldman Sachs didn’t purchase shit mate. Circle purchased poloniex and circle is not backed by Goldman Sachs as people think that’s just word play. Backed would mean they are legally behind them and are affected by the outcome of Circle, but GS couldn’t give a shit if Circle fails. Goldman Sachs invested with pocket change into a start up company called Circle (as all conglomerates invest in start ups) because it’s nothing for them and in the hope that one of the companies they invest in becomes huge, well then its highly
Profitable for them.

@_date: 2018-08-09 06:41:08
The difference between an ETF and future contracts is that future contracts don’t need the underlying asset while and ETF requires physical BTC and it allows institutes to hedge and bring it mainstream because it will pump the price which triggers fomo and attention of people and legitimises it further. So the ETF is important to BTC as it’s not only a currency it’s also store of value. Also since btc was designed consensus free, institutes have the same right to purchase BTC as you do. Also whether you like it or not, banks can make it a lot harder for adoption if they all stop service to all exchanges. Majority ain’t gonna buy btc in some alleyway with cash. Before the western world actually “needs” btc, when the usd finally collapses, could still take many many years. It’s better if they start adopting blockchain and buying btc as a hedge not kicking them out. Banks will bring btc much more mainstream a lot faster when they pump crypto to trillions. The price and legitimacy would create big fomo and attention which then turns to education on the subject. Randoms will ask “why is it still going up? Why are Institutes buying this scam?” “Maybe it’s not a scam?” Then they learn and realise it’s the future.

I know exactly what bitcoin is but it does not mean it will happen. Btc is not ready for a currency. Scaling? Fees? Deflationary? Majority is already owned by some Jihan Wu guy. 
Banks have all the power atm. Majority listen to governments. Anarchy is a minority. The “doom” might happen in 30 years for all you know. Learn economics and how the world spins. Blockchain is a amazing tech, but destroying banks...lol. Every successful revolution has had a centralised group or face to lead it. It was organised and had huge influence since the ruling governments made the majority hate them. Majority had incentive to fight back. The western world has no incentive to destroy banks. People are happier than they have ever been. Google it. No one cares about destroying banks. If you live in the western world you have utopia. Try being born in NK or Venezuela or back in Medievil
Times. Who would lead a revolution in a decentralised world? Vitalik? Roger? Haha. Banks will adapt and adopt crypto. Imagine their own crypto? A currency that they control and can see every transaction ever made and instantly can cut or take from you? Sounds like a wet dream to give them more power. Btc May one day replace fiat, but that may take many many years and banks if anything would be replaced with crypto banks. Giving out btc loans or whatever currency.

In the bull run, these bots would not have made the candles you see today. Some bots yeh for sure but they gone or trading with less cash. Manipulation is always gonna happen in a free market. Buy mass btc OTC then short it by dumping on exchanges.

What a fkn stupid person you are lol. How are the supposed to invest in btc when banks won’t allow it over there? How are the people who need to pay for food gonna use btc? There is little education of crypto over there. They don’t even have electricity. Btc has been tanking for 6 months and it could way lower.
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:06:28
Bots holding millions of tether trade and wash trade. It’s what causes those big spikes and drops. Some fomo and panic selling also helps a bit. No liquidity and volume makes it easy to crest big candles

Make a offline paper wallet using your new PC then just send it there using your new PC also. Do all logins using our new pc. Unless you have a software wallet on your old pc? Either way, download that wallet then onto your new PC and just out in the details like pw and seed. You don’t need your old PC. Your btc is not technically stored in your pc anyway.

Lol came on here to show how smart you are? Clap clap for the handicap.
Retail bubble popped. Moon boys said it won’t pop, they don’t know shit. Btc has popped many times in the past yet every few years it’s value is dramatically more. The institutional bubble hasn’t popped yet. Once all regulations and many other things are made clear, all the smart money inc banks will buy btc as a strategic investment to hedge incase btc is accepted as a reserve currency. With their pocket money they can pump btc to 100k as it’s got low liquidity and highly volatile.
Remind me in a year what the price is.

Not scared, annoyed. Another hurdle to crush. IF and when BTC starts becoming a widely accepted form of payment by real retailers, then they will get ‘scared’. Atm btc is not used as a currency rather a asset to hold and sell for more fiat in the future. Ironic lol. It will change in time. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:23:27
Banks are not scared. Lol you severely underestimate and are clueless to their power and influence. This is just another hurdle for them to conquer. When and IF btc is ever used as a currency and starts being accepted by major retailers THEN the banks can be more worried. But that might not happen in our lifetimes. Btc is not ready. Hope it does but I’m a realist. Btc will become a reserve currency before it replaces fiat and banks won’t go away even if it does. They will adapt like the virus they are. They will buy up all the btc to control it if they have to. They could do that with pocket money. Anarchy is a minority and the majority are sheep that listen to the government. They care about convenience not a full scale revolution taking down the banks. Lol get a grip. Banks ain’t scared they are annoyed. Banks ain’t going anywhere anytime soon especially in the western world. Maybe your the idiot...?

Ah yes I did type that but I didn’t make it more clear as to what I meant by that. My bad. I meant holding your wealth in a btc wallet and becoming your OWN bank has its risks. Not that the wallet is not secure. It’s like holding cash, you get robbed and banks will say too bad, if your bank account gets hacked they will repay all of it as it’s their responsibility. So I don’t mind paying those fees. Plus not all banks work like American ones. Many diff countries have different banking systems.

Yeh but my statement is still true. Majority of people are sheep and will listen to their government without question. They might complain and Winge but they won’t do anything about it. Especially the western world. Either banks buy up all btc and hence control it or they make heavy regulations that make it unattractive to use (look what Poland did with crypto and taxes) or they can outright just ban it. Not saying they can stop it, I’m saying hat CAN control it. They have all the power since they are organised and have huge influence. The public are plebs and unorganised. Anarchism is a minority in the western world especially.

I agree 100% but it won’t happen unless something massive occurs. Btc won’t replace fiat or won’t ever become a global currency. Can’t have a global currency, not any time soon or in our lifetimes at least. It would collapse too many poor countries like the Euro did to Greece and Italy. But a store of value? Fk yeh. Means of settling transactions? Oh yeh. Currency of the internet? Possibly.

There has never been a safe, easy, almost instant and soon to be easy way to transfer wealth globally peer to peer. Btc is the king for a reason.

There is no backup at the moment and if you want adoption you will need some insurance and someone to back it up. Who’s gonna do that with no banks? You lose you snooz mentality?

@_date: 2018-07-05 09:15:44
I’m taking about being your own bank. If you want that you have 0 insurance. Same as if you hold everything in cash. You lose cash, bank won’t give you back a thing. That’s why no one holds their entire life savings in cash. Get robbed? Rekt. Banks offer a service to secure your money that’s why there is fees. Yeh every single conglomerate has some corruption but all I hear is silly anarchist who don’t know economics or anything talk about how the big bad banks steal from them lol. Yeh many banks are bs and need to be shot but you won’t get a better service and they don’t steal from you. They give you interest actually. Btc is a better choice to hold your money BUT at your OWN risk.

The Commonwealth Bank is not Australia’s reserve bank anymore so your wrong there. The reserve bank of Australia prints money and it was established by the government and privatised to be heavily regulated and limited by shareholders. A private company does not give the company freedom to do whatever they want. The RBA has 2m shares that’s split and not one person can have more than 10k shares. They can’t print money whenever they want this is conspiracy theory and lack of knowledge. Being a private company means you are heavily regulated and also the public has a say in it if they choose. Our treasurer picks the people on the board. Obv there is corruption but it’s in the interest of the country.

You just took some definitions form a economy text book. This does not work in real life. It’s not that simple. It won’t work like that if a country or two adopts btc it would maybe possibly for a bit work if btc became the global currency but that will not happen if ever. A global currency like btc wont work because of different culture, trade laws, tax laws. Also it would destroy many underdeveloped countries like the Euro did to Greece and Italy. It would be a war crime pretty much lol. You need to control a currency. Eventually btc will be so limited because so many randoms lose their wallet just like lots loose their coins and dollars everyday then what? Can’t create more and those who have more btc get richer? Store of value yeh. Global currency not in our lifetimes.

So you expect banks to do their job of protecting your money for free? Give you insurance on your money for free? Pay you interest for free?
If your crypto gets hacked you got rekt. If the bank gets hacked they will replace every dollar. Sure banks are corrupt and take a fee, at least they offer way more security than crypto wallets atm. Their a business, you don’t get a free ride. Use cash if your so paranoid. Who will insure crypto if you destroy banks? Average mum and dad ain’t gonna risk it mate. Banks will be replaced with crypto banks if anything and adopt/adapt wit crypto.

They can’t destroy it but they can sure as hell hinders it’s adoption. They won’t ban it in most countries but there is nothing stopping them from making it illegal if they chose for whatever reason and since the majority of people are sheep, they will listen and follow.

Many Banks will buy btc as a strategic investment to hedge or to control. On top of that security tokens will boost the US economy unit a ne hyper drive. Wall st will be all over them. This is new tech and so many engineers are at work. Crypto hasn’t even taken its roots yet and this whole phenomena is because of BTC. The future kids decide what has value. Gold produces revenue? Btc is a better store of value than gold. Faster to transfer, literally limited supply, can’t be destroyed and is peer to peer direct global transfer of value. Never ever have we had that before and it’s decentralised giving it security. It’s the safest investment also in terms of never being hacked.

Yeeee bullish article but evidence is speculative. Maybe or maybe not. We are here because we believe btc is the new gold and possibly currency but if he elites thought this wouldn’t he price already be factored in? Whales would be buying all over the world and in huge numbers. You can only get so much BTC OTC the rest has to be exchanges, price would be much higher but it’s not. Truth is not unless the world starts to accept btc as the the gold ( especially the elites) then it won’t pump like we think.

Yeh look my point was that people hate banks for stupid reasons. I hold my money in the bank and have never had a problem. World is corrupt? Yeh so what I used the system to my advantage and have a great life. Stupid anarchists crying all the time usually have very little information on how the world works. They are more opinionated than informed.. They just cry and cry and blame others (banks and governments) for their failure. Yeh system
Ain’t fair but if you work smart enough it’s fine. It’s actually utopia compared to being born in NK or some parts in Africa or Middle East. If your from the western world and constantly cry about the big bad governments and do nothing but complain then your just a baby.

I’m assuming your talking about America because this don’t happen in other counties so easily. Australia for one is very regulated and tight when it comes to printing any money. We have very good and tough anti corruption laws.

I am a rich person and know many more you kid. The risk vs reward is not worth it. Press release don’t guarantee shit as clearly we have many bullish news articles and yet nothing. You realise this is global? He doesn’t know if a guy from China will dump on him or a wall st VC will manipulate another article to tank the price also. The liquidity to too low to just domp millions without affecting the market also. They don’t care about 4m. Not with the current risk. Don’t reply lol, just learn. You got no clue only opinions. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:15:42
You can if you invest in the right tokens. Massive money will come but which coins? Many coins will die. Btc only safe bet.

Sad attempt to increase revenues from a dying company it seems. Riding off the back of the great BTC. Like Kodak adding blockchain to their marketing and seeing a 3x rise.

It don’t matter what they do. Once the killer daap is made that will change the world, crypto will bring mass adoption and moon. It will take years but it will happen.

How much btc is a unicorn worth?
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:49:50
Who cares if there is a few richer beyond imagination. There will always be the rich and the poor. Btc was not designed to make everyone equally rich or poor, it was designed to be a alternative monetary system that’s DECENTRALISED and censorship resistant. A better store of value. Btc is the only thing the government can’t take from you. You own it 100% and they can’t seize it even if they tried (not with current tech anyway). They can seize your house, car, valuables, cash in the bank but they can suck your dick trying to get your btc unless you silly enough to hold it on a centralised exchange.
