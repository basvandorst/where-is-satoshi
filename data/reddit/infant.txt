Seriously, if you have a camera and and 20 mins the verification should be pretty simple.

Sorry, I'm out of the loop. Why is the COIN etf approval such a big deal if GBTC is already approved and able to be bought? What's the difference? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 03:01:23
For sure. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:41:31
Say it was approved; would there be a big delay in its launch? 
I'm asking because I have cash in a retirement account. So, I can't buy btc and I'm afraid if COIN is approved the price will skyrocket. 
Would it make sense to buy GBTC now, or wait and buy COIN even though it could be at a much higher price? 
Or I end up buying GBTC, no approval, price tanks for a bit and I lose on the premium.  
Not sure what to do. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:51:58
Why is this different then the GBTC etf?

Using money to influence the state, who enforces unjust laws through violence, or the threat of it, is the travesty.

Oh well, you should see there response today - June 6 2013 -
Dear Friends,
It is with great regret that we have decided to temporarily suspend operations due to bank account closure and a surge of fraudulent transactions. The effects have been two-fold: 1) Inflicting monetary losses on the company and 2) Damaging our primary banking relationships. These circumstances make it infeasible to continue operating the service without significant changes to our transfer system and identification measures. We feel it is our responsibility to pause operations now rather than risk any customer funds becoming vulnerable. We will be working in the coming weeks with partners and our legal counsel to overcome these obstacles and implement new measures to prevent these types of setbacks in the future.
Please be aware that all CAD, USD, and BTC funds are secure. Users are free to login and withdraw their funds through our system. However, given the anticipated volume, currency-processing times will take longer than usual and BTC will need to be transferred from cold storage. Therefore, please anticipate the following timeline for withdrawals:
CAD: 2-10 Business Days
USD: 2-10 Business Days
BTC: 1-3 Days
While email INTERAC is no longer available, direct deposit will be offered to all users. Also, all currently open orders will be cancelled and those funds will become available.
These last six months have been a wild ride. We've had an incredible opportunity to take part in the Bitcoin revolution and help thousands of new and experienced users trade more easily. A big thank you to everyone who has supported us, pushed us, and given us valuable suggestions to make this service even better. Bringing Libertybit to life has been our passion for the last year, and it's been an honor to offer this service to all of you.
Thank you again for all your support. We welcome your thoughts and suggestions for the future of Libertybit, and look forward to serving you all again soon.
Paul Szczesny
Founder and CEO

I can only imagine what both exchanges are going through with all the sudden interest, but I don't see why moving BTC in and BTC out requires verification.

Know what I'm gonna do at 100k? Two girls at the same time.

Just underdogs with revolutionary ideas.

At least you can be part of it now. It's been the most fun I've had staring at a screen since I got a Nintendo 20 years ago. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:44:30
Do you mean GOX? Yeah, that's what I've read too. They have a statement from May that says it's OK, but then they have another statement that says ANY withdraws must be verified. Statements aside, my account is not allowed. I've tried for days.

"he" ..... that is the guy

Nah, it was on the national news last night. Thought it was new. Sorry it was old. Fuck off everyone.

He said he would gladly go to Sweden if they guaranteed him he wouldn't be extradited to the U.S.....
I can't open links where I'm at, but I think that's a source.

A fool and his bitcoin were lucky enough to get together in the first place.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:33:59
I know, but I feel like it is financial news. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:28:02
I know this, and I was a little reluctant to use Gandhi's struggle in context to BTC. But, the quote seemed to fit the situation to well not to use it. I'm watching Bloomberg right now, and 6 talking heads are either laughing or fighting BTC. We've reached the mainstream, this was hardly imaginable last year. They are forced to talk about it now, but they are not happy, and I am pretty sure we're winning.

I feel like if Bush was president, they'd be discussing islamo-terrorist-internety-money right now.

Someone is saying this is a headline......and somebody who decides whats makes the minute to minute headlines is saying, no, it is not.

I felt, by writing more of the conversation, it would make people happy.

 "Damn straight. I always wanted to do that, man. And I think if I had a million dollars I could hook that up, 'cause chicks dig a dude with money."
"Well, not all chicks"
"Well the kind of chicks that'd double up on a dude like me do."
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:15:47
so it started an hour ago?
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:49:35
But, yeah man. I know. At least we're having fun. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:32:35
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.
