It was never hard to pull off a hard fork safely.  It never will be hard.  That's a lie.  Do you know how many coins hard fork all the time safely?  Bitcoin Cash is about to hard fork.  Just watch.  It's not hard at all.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:24:22
That's entirely untrue.

It only ever reached a little over 1000.  That's less than 400 dollars away.  My guess is it's going to be over 2K in a few weeks if not sooner as bitcoin is fundamentally broken as peer to peer cash.

No.  It's similar in that the layer above relies on the layer below.

All you have to do is compare the full nodes for each system.  Bitcoin Cash has at least 4 full node implementations whereas Bitcoin Segwit has just 2--they call them full clients I believe.  
Literally just go to the website for each, then go the respective full node sections, follow that to github for each and you'll see the devs and teams.

Point is that's all over.  Now there is only the will of Blockstream.  Blockstream won.  Whatever happens to bitcoin now, they own it--completely.

*Blockstream shill for life*  
  
I KNOW!  That's what I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:28:45
If you only go to this sub then that is actually true.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:33:55
There's no pushing hard, playing dirty or politics.  There is only the will of Blockstream.  Good luck.

If people are even interested in bitcoin, the rise will continue  after Segwit is fully adopted.  1MB blocks DO NOT WORK and never will.  Just be honest already.

This place has more rhetoric and propaganda than any other place.  I hold equal amounts of bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  We have both of the main options now with that.   Let the best coin win.  I'll support both.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:09:23
There's no such thing as weight limit.  That makes no sense at all in context of moving data.  Possibly you could say blocks are limited to roughly 1.2 MB now which is what is demonstrably bearing out on the production network right now.

Video is from March.  Absolutely nothing new in terms of Lightning.  Lightning is like Fusion but always 18 months away.  It's not happening folks.  You have broadcast problems in Lightning as well--pipe dream.  
I hope it works, I really do as I own equal amounts Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash but I don't see it happening.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:23:48
Gotcha...they just employ greater than 50% of the devs.  Your conspiracy theory assertions are absurd.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:26:52
There is no debate any more.  The public got Bitcoin Cash.  Now we get to see who was right.   
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:36:30
BCH literally has more development teams than Core.  I don't know why you guys are pushing this silly message.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:11:31
I read a few lines of this, then you started pushing the conspiracy theory agenda.  
Go look for the source of that spreadsheet.  It's easy to find.  I'm done explaining as you will ignore everything and honestly I don't care anymore.  The time for debate is over.  There is Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash now.  Go Bitcoin Cash!
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:49:23
You haven't done anything.  You're yet another Blockstream shill.  I've provided you evidence but you'll just deny that as well.   
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:11:49
I've made more money on Bitcoin Cash so I'm not sure what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:20:39
Professor Knottenbelt?  He'll keep everything from falling down.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:24:08
If you say so.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:10:11
I have 50/50 now and will stay that way forever.  The bankers may win but they are being forced to control their own death through Blockstream.
