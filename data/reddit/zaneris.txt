Damn, just short, I'll have to wait a bit for BTC to go back up a bit. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 22:36:16
You really should consider selling these for like $200 a pop, people will buy them. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:57:13
Agreed, sticking to the SI system is something everyone can relate to, like Milli Bitcoin, you instantly know what it is, and how much. Or for American folk, something like a Bitcoin Cent perhaps, and everyone would immediately know it's 0.01 BTC

Do you ship to Canada?

Why was it a "piece of shit" transaction then? 
Edit: Ah! 
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:14:04
They definitely are impulse buys for some people. 
Hell, a car is an impulse buy for some people. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:41:33
You sure people aren't selling merely in anticipation of the large us gov auction of bitcoins?

New adopters aren't going to know what a trezor is or why it's more secure. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:52:17
I'm not a huge bitcoin supporter since I still see it as something that could fail at any moment from one little fault and become worthless, I also don't see it as something that could ever see widespread use due to the lack of security that a bank has. Bitcoin is a digital equivalent of cash, and people don't go wandering around everywhere they go with their life savings, $50, $100, sure, $1000s that someone could pickpocket at any moment? Eh... Not too many people are going to risk that. 
Anyway, this subreddit just comes off as one big circle jerk as an outsider, with plenty of people wayyyy too optimistic about its future.

Not true, flight level is used once you've crossed your transition level and indicates whether or not you're on standard pressure (29.92inhg or 1013mb) or aerodrome qnh. Transition level may vary depending on where you are in the world. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:20:35
Because it's a legal gray area? 
Crypto is unregulated.
Technically you gave them $70k in BTC.
For someone who supposedly has 20 years of IT experience, I'm not sure why you thought it was a good idea to have that much in a web wallet in the first place? It should definitely have been in a paper wallet or a Trezor. You were basically asking for it to be stolen eventually. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:19:46
Thanks for the advice, just bought in now. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 03:28:24
And please do not use a credit card to buy stock... That's a horrible idea.

Stargate quote?

Yeah, so long as you are the only one using a particular set of dice, even if they have a certain load/bias, it doesn't really matter since it only biases the keys you in particular are generating. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:14:21
I get that it's not a fault of the technology itself, but when someone happens to install spyware that steals their private key, they have no idea what happened or why it happened, and they'll read in the news how so and so had their coins stolen; whereas, with a wallet, they get pickpocketed, they understand it, how it could have been prevented and how it's partially their fault. Having a well informed userbase is essential to the success of bitcoin.

Spending from it, seems like the consensus is on mycelium being the most trustworthy.

I'm not sure... 
I tried IE chrome and Firefox on Windows 7 with no luck, the interac site always timed out. I did finally manage to get it to work though through safari on my phone.

All of it is from just 3 weeks in November. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:51:29
Any bank operating in Canada requires ID and proof of residency to open an account... so more than likely they're just preparing for the inevitable regulation of bitcoin exchanges and being proactive about it.
cavirtex.com requires the same.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:32:22
The block chain doesn't lie. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:36:57
I'd definitely be interested in something like this, I'm sure would love it as well.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:49:52
I applied yesterday... verified today, made my first trade with no issues.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:08:44
True... it's about a 3 day drive to Vancouver, lol.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:38:10
I realize you've been in the tech business for quite some time and made millions through digg, etc... but wouldn't everyone using BTC for real life every day purchases more and more be far greater for the success of the currency than hoarding them for a longer period?
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:42:35
So buy some bitcoin... Start small, $10 or so
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:49:17
quickbt.com isn't working for me.

It's actually $40 Mill

And it'd be death by taliban the next day. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:49:27
I'd pay 40-50 for one

He still didn't have to release the information about their spying on other countries, that's treason, no way around it.
I'm not even american. Imagine someone in your country released the info of your own country's spy program on an ally and potentially ruined relations, your country's economy or worse, started a war. Would you still revere said person? And don't try telling me your country doesn't conduct espionage, all countries do to varying degrees.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:53:43
I don't understand all of the love for Snowden, sure he may be popular with the rest of the world, but within the states, what he did was treason.
Telling americans about spying on americans... cool.
Telling the rest of the world about your spying... insta-traitor.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:24:52
I'm thinking it's working both ways, new investors jumping aboard and people who have had bitcoins for ages and forgotten about them getting wind of the value now and dumping them for a huge profit.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:55:38
The new kncminer for $12,000 at 3000GH/s should pay for itself in under a month.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:57:41
I can see the advantage for businesses/merchants to accept bitcoin, but outside of online purchases, what incentive is there for consumers to use bitcoin vs say their debit or credit card that are pretty much universally accepted? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:53:51
So easy to spoof a transfer... Never trust a transaction without at least 1 confirmation. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:22:15
Ah gotcha, I wasn't aware.
