Just as much as web based Bitcoin wallets defeat the purpose of Bitcoin.
In the end it probably helps the cause (because people can get easier access, thus more people will join), but it doesn't break anything for those who want to run the "native" client and get all the benefits.

Agreed, and Circle works like a charm, too. But only when it works.
Unfortunately, Circle doesn't support non-US cards (not even credit). Well, some people were lucky to be able to add their card, and it works for them, but others (like me) are not, and Circle doesn't want to respond to inquiries of when they will implement this.
A year ago (or thereabouts) they said this was something they had focus on; now they just seem to ignore any mails about this topic.
Well, if they don't want my money, I won't force them...

I would recommend using Armory instead of Electrum, as Armory is still supported. :)

It is indeed much faster than it was. Yet, 5-9 hours is an *absurdly* long time to wait before being able to use a program for the first time. I don't know *any* other program with this long initialization process.
But don't get me wrong; I am running a full node from my home computer myself, and have done so for something like a year and a half straight. However, I imagine not every new user would accept these init and start-up times as perfectly ok.

I use [Armory]( but then again, I prefer to sacrifice a smooth learning curve in order to gain options and safety. And I don't think it's so hard to use as people sometimes make it. It *does* require you to run bitcoind (the back-end of Bitcoin Core) and store the entire blockchain, though, and it takes several minutes to load, even on a fairly powerful desktop computer.
Anyway, cold storage is the way for any amount that you want to keep safe, be it software, hardware, or paper based.
So, I have an Armory "hot wallet" (with private keys stored on my online computer) that I can easily spend from and use to transfer onto my mobile wallet. I never keep any amount of significance here.
And then I have an [Armory cold wallet]( The wallet is controlled from the same instance of Armory that also keeps my hot wallet, but should the time come to transfer an amount *away* from the cold wallet, I will need to boot up an old computer (which is not connected to the Internet) which sole purpose is to store the private keys of my cold wallet. From time to time (when my hot wallet gets to contain too high an amount for my likings), I do a transfer to my cold wallet -- which I can do without booting the cold wallet computer, of course.

Viewing an encrypted and signed mail from them in Thunderbird with the Enigmail extension, I just clicked the button that lets you automatically fetch the sender's public key from a key server. That worked fine, so it must be on at least one of the common key servers.

Agreed. Changing the default to e.g. µBTC or mBTC might not be a bad idea, but calling it "bits" is. I think we will have a lot of newbie explaining to do about the fact that "1 bit" ≠ "1 bitcoin".

Upgrading was without problems for me. If you experienced problems, I suggest you [raise a detailed bug report]( with the Armory team so that if there is a bug, it may be solved.

I should say so. Some of the time codes might also need adjusting, but generally they should be good. I haven't actually tested the file with the video, though.

Confirmed. I bought a small amount of coin with a non-US Visa card through Circle.

Thank you for explaining this very problematic situation of the name "bits". I couldn't agree more with every sentence you wrote. Using μBTC but calling it something unambiguous would be great, but the name "bits" is less than good and bound to cause confusion. Several alternatives have been proposed.

I signed up at the last reddit post about Novauri. And now you say the VIP beta is US only. Bah! At least your competition understands how to get things running internationally. Even during closed beta.

This is so great! I am currently translating the remainder of the Bitcoin Core client into Danish, and after that I plan to translate bitcoin.org. Earlier I translated Schildbach's Android Bitcoin Wallet and the subtitles for weusecoins' video. I had hoped to also translate Armory, but unfortunately it doesn't support i18n (yet?).
Internationalization is a key factor in bringing Bitcoin to less tech savvy people around the world!

Yes, the author made it possible to send your encrypted backup file to any app on your phone through the standard Android "share" system. So it's easy to send it via mail, to Dropbox/etc. or what ever app you want to handle the storage of your encrypted backup.

If you let somebody else generate the address for you, they will know part of the private key, if I am not mistaken. I guess that would be considered less secure. By generating the address yourself, you won't let others know the private key, though. Or perhaps it's something else that makes them considered less secure?


You'll probably want to use a vanity address as a *receiving* address, not a payment address. And probably in situations where you won't be able to create a new address for every transaction, like listing a donation address on your web page, where you don't want to implement a payment service, etc.
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:09:40




Not if 1 bit = 1 BTC, which is the ambiguous part. Sorry, bad joke.


Agreed. Choose any other name that isn't ambiguous. "Micros" and "mikes" (and probably others) have been suggested. Then, let users choose if they prefer that or µBTC.

My Danish (i.e. one type of European keyboards) keyboard doesn't have it printed on. I'd believe not many other keyboards than Greek ones have.
Anyway, in both Ubuntu Linux and in Windows I'm able to type the letter µ by holding down the "AltGr" key while typing the "m" key. Doesn't that work in other places around the world, too?
Bonus info: AltGr+e gives €, AltGr+shift+y gives ¥, AltGr+shift+e gives ¢, and there are lots and lots more combinations for various glyphs and punctuation.

But if any P2Pool had the user base (and collected hashing power) that ghash has now, would miners on that P2Pool still have to wait 2-3 weeks for a block? (sorry if this is a noob question)
The detailed stats are a miss, though, but I bet someone would stick something together if P2Pools started receiving the attention that ghash has now.

That is a very valid question. No, Circle owns and controls your private keys and can do with your money as they please, just like Coinbase. It's nice for buying BTC, though, and besides, I don't know any other way I can do that without having to trust the party from which I buy. As AaronPaul says, as soon as the BTC hits your Circle wallet, transfer it to a wallet of which you control the private keys.
Although Circle is set up as a wallet, I'd never use it as such, except maybe for small-amount day-to-day spends, once that gets common in this part of the globe. PLEASE, don't use Circle for large amounts.

@_date: 2014-06-01 09:55:15
In this tutorial we've cheated a bit
and turned time forward,
so in a short while,
when the process ends,
we will see that the
watching only wallet
will have been imported properly,
and that the balances are
once again shown.
The balance for the watching only wallet
will of course be 0,
and in the online wallet that
I had already on the system,
I have put a small amount of
bitcoin that we will play around with
in the next parts of this tutorial,
where we will
send bitcoin to and from
the offline wallet.
Now, double click
the watching only wallet,
and in the window that appears,
click "Belongs to: Someone else..."
Tell Armory that
the wallet belongs to you,
and click OK.
You can now see, that Armory
detects your new wallet
as an offline wallet.
**Part 2**
Sending bitcoin
TO the offline wallet is done
without involving the
cold storage computer.
So this is just the same as any other
transaction you would do in Armory.
As mentioned before, here we have a
small amount of bitcoin in a normal wallet,
which we will send to
an address in the offline wallet.
So, to get a receiving address,
click "Receive Bitcoins",
choose the offline wallet,
and click OK.
You'll get a warning that you cannot
spend bitcoins from this wallet
from this computer,
but that's ok.
That's what we have the
cold storage computer for.
Click Ok,
And you will get a new receiving address
for the offline wallet,
which you can copy to the clipboard.
Now, in the main window,
click the "Send Bitcoins" button,
Make sure that the wallet containing funds
is selected under "Sending from".
Paste the offline wallet address
into the recipient address field,
And type in an amount to send.
Then, click the "Send!" button.
Type in your password for
your sending wallet,
and click "Unlock".
After a few seconds of waiting time,
the transaction will go through,
and few minutes later,
it will have enough confirmations
to be spendable.
We will see how to actually
spend the funds
in the next and final part
of this tutorial.
**Part 3**
Sending bitcoin FROM an
offline wallet
is much the same as sending
from an ordinary, online wallet,
except for the fact that
the transaction must be signed
on the cold storage computer which
hosts the private keys to the offline wallet.
To demonstrate this, let's send the
bitcoin back to our regular online wallet.
So, before we initiate the transaction
on the online computer,
we need to get a receiving address.
Click "Receive Bitcoins",
and then select the online wallet.
We will then see the newly generated
address, along with a QR code.
Copy it to clipboard, like before.
The transaction is started
like any other transaction:
Click "Send Bitcoins"
and select the offline wallet.
Fill in receiving address,
and an amount,
and we're ready to create
an unsigned transaction.
Click Continue.
Now, you will be presented with
the details of the unsigned transaction.
Save the unsigned transaction
to a file,
and put it directly on the USB stick.
Now, it's time to eject the USB stick,
and go to the cold storage computer.
After inserting the USB stick
in the cold storage computer,
we will use Armory to sign it
with the private key,
and then save it back to
the USB drive,
for broadcast to
the Bitcoin network
through the online computer.
Click "Offline Transactions",
and then "Sign Offline Transaction".
Load the file that contains
the unsigned transaction
from the USB stick.
And make sure to look through
the details of the transaction thoroughly.
If everything looks OK,
click "Sign",
and type your password
for your offline wallet.
A new signed version
of the transaction file
will automatically be saved
to the USB stick.
Once again,
eject the USB stick,
and go back to the online computer.
Insert the USB stick,
and in the window that we left before,
click "Continue".
If you closed that window,
just click "Offline Transactions",
then "Sign and/or broadcast transaction".
Load the signed transaction file
from the USB drive.
Now it should say
"All Signatures Valid!"
where it said "Unsigned" before.
So, you're safe to
"Broadcast" the transaction
which means sending it to
the rest of the Bitcoin network.
Soon, you should see
the transaction go through,
and the balances change.
After a few minutes
you should also start to see
confirmations come in
for the transaction.
This concludes this tutorial
in which we saw:
- How to install Armory
on an offline computer
- How to set up an offline wallet
and import a watching only version
- How to transfer bitcoin
TO an offline wallet
- And how to transfer bitcoin
FROM an offline wallet.

I don't believe there's a magic limit of "functioning good" above 8 connections. It's probably more like, the more connections the merrier.
What makes the 8 connection limit is the fact that the bitcoin client will make a maximum of 8 outgoing connections to other peers (who have their port 8333 open). Outgoing connections can be made regardless of whether port 8333 is open or not.
In order to accept incoming connections, and thus get the total connection count above 8, you must open port 8333 in your router/modem, and possibly redirect incoming traffic on port 8333 to your computer's local IP address (this is called "port forwarding").

Ok, let think of a hypothetical situation, where a p2pool of your choice was as big as ghash is now (and ghash has an insignificant size). So same situation as now, except for the sizes. Would ghash still be the best option for miners (and thus people would move there and make the ratio what it is now), or would that certain p2pool be the best option for miners?
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:25:57

"Harder" being a relative term, it is of course true what you say, since you need one more tool working, but fact is that it is [not *that* hard]( to set up. It is definitely not any harder than figuring out static IP addresses of an Antminer S2 or similar and setting it up to run with a pool; or setting up cgminer/bfgminer, for that matter. Just one more equally hard/not hard thing to set up.

@_date: 2014-11-18 19:32:03
Good call. Though, as you probably know, the mail reason for doing so (and I do the same) is the fact that you don't control the private keys so at any given time, Circle (or Coinbase, or whomever) may decide to take your coins and run. Or go bankrupt. Or have a hardware/software failure. Or whatever out of your control.
Most people probably know this (I hope they do), but I just feel it can't be repeated enough.

**Part 1**
Using Armory as an offline wallet,
you'll have two Armory installations:
One on an online computer,
And one on a computer, that has
never been connected to the Internet.
The offline computer, a.k.a. "cold storage",
is where your private keys are being stored,
and you need to use it only when you want
to send funds FROM your offline wallet.
On the online computer, you are able to
follow the offline wallet's balance,
add addresses for receiving funds,
and initiate sending transactions
that will be signed on the offline computer.
In this tutorial,
we will assume that you have
a running Armory installation
on your online computer.
We'll show how to install Armory
on your cold storage computer,
with the use of a USB stick.
Fire up your web browser and go to:
Click Download.
Click the Ubuntu logo.
And download the newest version
for either 32 or 64 bits,
whatever fits your
cold storage computer.
Save the file to your harddisk.
Now we need to download some
background tools, which Armory needs,
which are normally automatically
downloaded when you install Armory.
But of course, for a computer without
Internet, we must do that manually.
Open the Terminal,
And change to the Downloads directory
where Armory was also saved:
    cd Downloads
Now we need to type in
a massive command,
that lists all the tools
we are going to download.
Note, that for this to work,
the versions of Ubuntu
on your online and offline computers
need to be the same.
    apt-get download python-psutil python-pyasn1 python-twisted python-twisted-conch python-twisted-lore python-twisted-mail python-twisted-names python-twisted-news python-twisted-runner python-twisted-words
Then press Enter.
After download has finished,
you can close the Terminal window.
If we go to the Downloads directory,
we can now see,
that both armory and all
the required tools are now there.
We need to copy them to a USB stick,
so select all files, right click,
and select "Copy" or "Cut".
Then, insert your USB stick,
and after a short while,
it should pop up on your desktop.
Right click somewhere
in the USB stick file window,
and select "Paste".
Then, "Eject" the USB stick
and pull it out from the USB slot.
Now go to your
cold storage computer,
the computer that has never
touched the Internet, and never will.
Here, we're going to install Armory,
and set up your
offline wallet,
and then move a
"watching only" copy of that wallet
to the online computer.
Start by inserting the USB stick,
and moving Armory and
its dependant tools
to the Downloads directory
for easy access.
Then, start up the Terminal.
and "cd" into the Downloads directory:
    cd Downloads
The following command
will install all .deb files in that directory:
    sudo dpkg -i *.deb
Type in your system password.
But unlike me,
try to actually remember your password,
so you won't have to
type it in several times :-)
That's it; you now have Armory
on your cold storage computer.
Now, let's set up an
offline wallet.
Start up Armory,
but this time choose the
"Armory (Offline)" icon.
Armory greets you,
letting you know that
you don't have a wallet,
so let's "Create Your First Wallet!"
Give the wallet a suiting name,
such as "Cold Wallet",
and optionally a description.
Then click "Next",
and type a new password twice
for your new offline wallet.
This password needs to be
strong and hard to guess,
and not based on a real word.
Also combine with numbers and symbols.
But, be sure to remember your password.
If you lose it, you'll likely lose your bitcoins!
On the other hand, if someone else
gets to your cold storage computer,
and guesses your password,
they can steal your bitcoin.
So choose a password with much care!
After having typed in
your password three times,
Armory will ask you to
print a paper backup.
This cannot be recommended enough!
Print several copies and store them safely.
If your cold storage computer
does not have a printer installed,
like this one,
you can copy the "Root Key" part
by hand onto a piece of paper.
After having printed
a wallet backup,
or copied it by hand,
you can verify
that your backup works.
Type in the two lines
from the "Root Key" part of the backup,
and Armory will tell you,
if your backup is good.
We'll skip that here, though.
Next step is to create a
"watching only" version of the wallet,
that does not include your secret
private keys.
This is the version of the wallet,
that will be used on the online computer.
Click the large "Create ..." button,
and save the file to your USB stick.
Then, eject the USB stick
and put it back into your online computer.
Back on your online computer,
we will now import the newly generated
"watching only" version
of the offline wallet.
In essense, the online computer
will handle everything
that has to do with the
offline wallet,
except when sending bitcoin
FROM the offline wallet,
you will have to "sign" the transaction
on the cold storage computer,
because that is the only place
where your private keys are.
Load up Armory,
and click "Import or Restore Wallet".
Select "Import digital backup or
watching only wallet", and click Continue.
Select your USB stick,
choose the "watchonly" file on it,
and click "Open".
It might take a while,
where it seems like nothing happens.
When import finishes,
Armory needs to rescan its databases,
in order to search the block chain
for any prior use
of the imported wallet.
Just let it do this.
Of course, we know that the wallet
has not been used,
but Armory doesn't,

With Circle.com it is REALLY easy and incredibly fast (instant!) to buy BTC using your credit card. Circle is still invite-only, though, so you might have to wait a long time for your invite after you requested it on their website. I waited several months. Oh, and it works internationally.

Depending on where he eats, in many places it wouldn't make sense to not tip a waiter/waitress if the plate is not correctly arranged. The waiter/waitress probably wasn't the one arranging the plate in the first place.
Also, the other way around, why tip the waiter if you feel the cook prepared a delicious meal for you?

This made me wonder how strong the Bitcoin network is against mass spamming. Have anyone (core devs, perhaps) tried to flood the test network with lots and lots of 0-fee transactions (or maybe even very low-fee transactions) and see what happens?

Yes, all this "bits" talk is so confusing. The idea to use denominations like µBTC or mBTC (not the actual names, but the denominations) is good, but the name "bits" is so ambiguous. Especially if people start prefixing it with "u", "µ" or "m" etc.

Yep. On many routers/modems you need to enable port forwarding, i.e. make traffic that arrives to your global IP address on port 8333 be forwarded to the local IP address of your Raspberry Pi. The tutorial mentions this, but not in detail since it differs from router to router.
@_date: 2014-06-15 08:06:34
That would be binary (pre-compiled) releases. It's common practice in open source to make source releases, and only let binaries come a few days later. Many other projects even do *only* source releases and let volunteers outside the core dev team handle binary releases for the various platforms.
So in other words, if you're in a hurry and "need" to run newly released software on day 1, you need to compile yourself.

Sure. An .srt file is just a plain text file, only with the .srt ending instead of .txt. So if you use Windows, you may use WordPad or Notepad to edit the file. Just make sure to have it save the file in plain text (txt) format.
Each subtitle "section", if you will, consists of a sequence number, a time code (a start time and an end time for when the subtitle shuld be shown on screen), one or more lines of text (the actual subtitle), and one empty line to mark the end of a subtitle section.
Each "section" may look something like this:

Yes. probably easier to run "bitcoind getinfo", though. The "connections" line tells you how many peers you're connected to.


Perhaps ping? I never tried; the far easiest way is to wait for more than 8 connections. It shouldn't take too long. If you've waited several hours at 8 connections, something is probably wrong.
As soon as you have 9 or more, you know it works, because bitcoin core is hardcoded to only make a max of 8 outgoing connections, so if you have 9 you are certain that at least one of them is incoming, which in turn means that you've opened the port correctly.

And, while we're talking incomprehensibly large numbers (and sizes):
@_date: 2014-06-21 08:47:25
Yes. And if "microbitcoin" is too long, call it *micros*.
@_date: 2014-06-21 08:15:08
Exactly! The idea is very good, but the name "bits" is just too close to "bitcoins". Bound to create confusion.
tl;dr: Call it *micros*, not bits.
I am for the idea of making µBTC the default denomination, but without calling it "bits". Besides, we already have a name for this denomination: "µBTC". If people think it's too weird having to type a non-latin letter (which seems to be the case, since µ is always confused with u, with which it has no connection), then call it *"micros"*. After all, µBTC is short for micro-BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:52:21
Can't exactly provide documented evidence (though it'd indeed be nice to see some comparisons over a period of time).
I *can* mention, though, that personally I've been setting the default fee in my Armory setup to 0.00001 BTC = 0.01 mBTC (also from 0.0001 BTC = 0.1 mBTC) for a good while now, only experiencing very few times where a transaction didn't make it into the following block, but then it was included into the next one instead.

Yeah, that's not a bad idea. You could load the system from a small SD card (4 GB should be more than enough), and then mount a large USB drive to ~/.bitcoin (where the block chain is stored). However, a 64 GB SD card is not really very expensive, so I think it'll just clutter the tutorial a bit. But thanks for the suggestion!

Same here. In my country we DO have something similar to the social security number, but I was not asked for it. And I was able to use my credit card to buy BTC. I did have to confirm a (non-US) mobile phone number, though.

Circle is great, but please don't let Circle or Coinbase hold your entire BTC keepings. Only keep small amounts there that you're prepared to lose, and when you buy more BTC, make sure to immediately transfer to a wallet where YOU and ONLY you control the private keys.
If not already, Circle will be forced to require the same background info on you on larger transfers and transfers to gambling sites etc., that we've heard Coinbase do lately.

You might want to add a question about geographical distribution in a later version of the survey. I think it would be nice to see this on a country or (at least) continent level.
In "Income", perhaps your should make clear whether you mean personal income or household income.
Also, you should state whether you mean before or after income taxes (makes a hell of a difference in many European countries, for instance).
All in all, nice survey. Thank you!

etotheipi on bitcointalk:
**Armory Version 0.92.3 Released**
We have officially released 0.92.3.  It's not on the website yet (that's not automated in our release process yet), but it will be shortly.
This release not only officially brings the [Tor/Privacy fix]( out of testing, it also fixes a rather scary-but-actually-benign bug that we found in the Armory code related to random number generation when signing Bitcoin messages (not transactions, just message signing).  For more details about this, read the full report here:
Armory Tech has pretty thoroughly investigated the incident and believes that no action is needed by anyone, even if you have signed thousands of messages.  Armory Technologies itself would be the most vulnerable since we use that feature to sign all of our releases.  We have determined that no exposure has occurred and still consider our offline signing key 100% safe.  Nonetheless, we have fixed the issue in this release.
[b]Before asking lots of questions[/b] please read the above PDF which I spent an exceptional amount of time writing.  It is extremely thorough, both in terms of our own analysis and concerns raised by Sergio Del Lerner, whom we contacted to provide an independent third-party opinion.  We also posted this to the our recently-formed Security Working Group and received positive feedback from two members, and no one raised any concerns about the analysis.
On that note, here's the download links for the new version, [b]but as always, we encourage you to use the secure downloader to get the new version if possible[/b]  (at this point most people should have 0.91+ and can use the secure downloader).
* [Armory 0.92.3 for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8+ (32- and 64-bit)](
* [Armory 0.92.3 for MacOSX 10.7+ (64bit)](
* [Armory 0.92.3 for Ubuntu 12.04+ (32bit)](
* [Armory 0.92.3 for Ubuntu 12.04+ (64bit)](
* [Armory 0.92.3 for RaspberryPi  (armhf)](
* [Armory 0.92.3 Offline Bundle for Ubuntu 12.04 exact (32bit)](
* [Armory 0.92.3 Offline Bundle for Ubuntu 12.04 exact (64bit)](
* [Armory 0.92.3 Offline Bundle for RaspberryPi  (armhf)](
* [Armory 0.92.3: Signed hashes of all installers](
[b]GOOD NEWS:[/b]  The latest Bitcoin Core release relaxed the isStandard() logic, so you should be able to up to 7-of-7 Armory Lockboxes on mainnet.  I haven't actually tested this, but I expect by now that a critical mass of miners have upgraded to Core 0.9.3, so spending 7-of-7 (or smaller) coins should work.  
The only requirement is that you upgrade your own version of Core to 0.9.3 -- which has been updated in the secure downloader as well! 
Other fixes:  
* URI handling bug fix (Coinbase-generated links were not working with Armory)
* Raspberry Pi install script and offline bundle was hosed.  Some empty debs have been replaced, and the double-click script should work properly now.  Please test it out for me!
* The Ubuntu offline bundles have been upgraded to support 12.04.5 now (since 12.04.3 was difficult to find).

Not on my Ubuntu system, but I seem to remember that it does on Windows, yes. Anyway, it would have made much more sense if the € symbol was printed on the "5" key instead of the "E" key, given it's the only AltGr symbol printed on any of the keys A through Z, while AltGr+3 gives £, and AltGr+4 gives $, and AltGr+6 gives ¥ (so AltGr+3 through 6 would all give currency symbols).

Somewhere else in this topic it was mentioned that transactions that consists of "old coins" can be sent without a fee. I guess that means the transaction should be sent from an address which has contained the coins that you're going to send for a certain amount of time?
Can anything general be said about the amount of time that triggers this?
Are there other factors? Transactions of large amounts of BTC comes into mind(?) How large?
Oh, and what's the incentive for miners to include such transactions without fees into a block?
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:41:48
If this is true (and and believe you when you say it is), people are actually, unknowingly, hurting the network by using Bitcoin Core or Armory as a wallet, probably being unknowing about running a full node that takes no incoming connections and is potentially on a slow line.

Ok, I decided to sell these for bitcoin. See  for details.
@_date: 2014-10-29 07:11:10
And that exactly is why calling it "bits" is bound to be confusing. A "bit" might be short for "microbitcoin", "millibitcoin", even just "bitcoin".
I like the idea of defaulting to µBTC amounts, and I understand that the "µ" symbol might look strange to most people, but "bits" is just too ambiguous. Something like "micros" perhaps?
So, tl;dr: denomination good, name bad.
@_date: 2014-11-19 10:44:14
Agreed. It's important that IF you decide to show fiat amount with a tip, it should be in ADDITION to the bitcoin amount, and it should be very clear that the fiat amount is just the CURRENT value of the bitcoin tip (e.g. "tip for xx bits (currently worth yy dollars)"). The bitcoin amount should always be central.

Actually I use Blender, but that amounts to the same result as a CAD program in this case.
Simplified a bit, I generate a QR code from a bitcoin address (there are several free tools to do so) and then import into Blender, where I extrude (add the third dimension, if you will) and combine with my existing 3D model of the keychain.
What went wrong for you?

Reading my reply again, sorry if it sounded harsh; I didn't intend it to.
I understand your reasons for not launching internationally from the beginning. I do think, however, that you should add a note about "US only initially" to your front page where people sign up for "VIP beta".
Also, I think you should carry over your promise of "waive[ing] your transaction fees for life" for those international customers that do sign up, for when/if their countries are supported, even though they can't join in from the beginning.
I messaged you with my email and country.
@_date: 2015-05-04 07:13:17
Yes, I thought of putting a bitcoin logo in the middle of the QR code, but decided to put it on the back of the keychain instead. Which kind of (simple) art would you want in the QR code if you would get a keychain?

@_date: 2015-05-28 20:03:03
It can keep the name. No PR confusion needed.
Instead of changing name, it can advance the version number. Assuming the current version number is 1.0, the new fork would be Bitcoin 2.0 (the network, not the software). Or whatever version number is relevant -- perhaps derived from the Bitcoin Core version number that will introduce the fork.
@_date: 2014-06-15 07:51:38
My guess is that it's torrent downloading on initial install (and possibly seeding thereafter) of most of the block chain. Makes the block chain download process much faster. Works very convincingly in Armory, and the [Bitcoin Core download page]( has linked to a torrent file containing the block chain (up to a certain point) for some time.

Basically something like this, assuming Blender:
* Generate QR svg file through e.g.  -- I found that Blender chokes on some svg files, but it seems to work from this site
* In Blender, File -&gt; Import -&gt; SVG
* In Object mode, select all QR objects, and press Alt-C, select "Mesh from curve/meta/surf/text".
* Still having all the objects selected, press Ctrl-J to join them.
* In Edit mode, select all faces (A), press Ctrl-V, then select "Remove doubles".
Now you should have an object that you can extrude and incorporate into your model. Remember to normalize all normals (Ctrl-N) of all faces after extrusion or you might get very weird results.

Circle or Coinbase? It's a matter of taste, so I'd say: **both**. You're planning to buy several times, anyway, so try one, then try the other.
Important thing is you're transferring your bitcoin off Circle or Coinbase once you bought it. Get a Trezor or install one of the more secure desktop wallet programs and set up a cold wallet, would be my advice. Then transfer your bitcoin there from Circle and Coinbase.

Every time you buy, don't look at it as an investment. Look at it as money spent. Look at the total fiat value of your BTC as already spent money. Gone. Expect Bitcoin to fail, then you'll be pleasantly surprised if it doesn't.

Or do like many others, buy a (fixed?) amount at a fixed interval (once a month, week, whatever), no matter the price. So many have tried their luck with trading only to quickly find out they don't have the stomach for it, then selling at a loss.
See low prices as a chance to get some more cheap coins, instead of worrying about the coins you already bought. Of course, this assumes you follow the mantra "don't invest more than you feel comfortable losing", and regard the dollars you spent as already lost, then perhaps you'll be pleasantly surprised later :-)

Yes, I can do that, sure. And it would enable you to pay in bitcoin, of course.
This would lower my markup to almost nothing (because of 20% VAT charged by Shapeways and two times shipping) and give me extra work, but I'm willing to do that for the cause of selling it for bitcoin.
If anyone is interested, please PM me. Price is USD 49 in bitcoin equivalent according to preev.com. This includes a customized keychain, painting and sanding, and (untracable) shipping to anywhere in the world. I would need payment upfront.
Unfortunately, I would have to ship it as an untraceable parcel, because assuming you live outside of Europe, it would cost me ~US$ 40 as a traceable parcel in shipping alone. Sending a small and light object like this as untraceable is much less expensive.

So great to hear about this. I'm running a full node myself, however not from a VPS but from my own 50/50 mbps fibre connection.
I've often wondered, though, and maybe this is really far-fetched, but please bear with me on this one:
Let's say setting up full nodes on VPS'es was very popular -- so popular that almost no-one was running full nodes on their own lines. Since there are far less VPS providers than there are people running full nodes, that would mean that many full nodes would be running on each provider's system. Then, if suddenly one of the largest VPS providers goes down/out of business/whatever, a lot of nodes go down with it.
tl;dr: Doesn't running full nodes on VPS'es introduce some (low?) level of centralization, i.e. be potentially bad for the network, at least if too many full nodes are on VPS'es?

I agree with 4), but it isn't important enough for me so that I want to ditch all the other wonderful features of Armory (e.g. I love the coin control features, the ability to have multiple wallets, and the ability to browse all addresses and their balances of any wallet). Besides, now that one of the developers has taken over development, maybe it's in his pipeline to add a more standardized implementation?
Regarding 2), I had no problem in running Armory from a Pi 1 when I was using it as my cold storage earlier on. It was a bit slow, but everything worked flawlessly with the Raspberry Pi bundle that included all dependencies as .deb packages.
Regarding 3), that's true, but I don't see that as a disadvantage, mainly because I also use this as a hot wallet, and at the same time allows me to run a Bitcoin node, all in the same instance.

From someone totally inexperienced with mining (except tried out for fun with a couple of those USB miners a few years ago when they were already obsolete):
Do you have an example of which "older ASIC" would that be? And in what ballpark would that "massive loss" be, assuming one bought one of those older ASICs? I guess worst case scenario (solo mining with no blocks found) would be the price of the ASIC + the electricity that it would consume.

I have only one thing that worries my slightly about this statement, though. Unless I'm mistaken, this will mean that in case of a BU hardfork, I will not be able to access any coins I have in Armory on the BU fork? Ideally I'd like to access those coins and swap them for Core coins.

Getting Bitcoin Core to compile and run on the lower spec'ed Raspberry Pi 1 and 2 was possible but hard. Getting it to run reliably over a period of more than a few hours was most likely impossible (I for one tried).
An Arduino, being a microcontroller on a board, not a full computer as such, is much less powerful than a Raspberry Pi 1 or 2, so there really is no chance of having it run Bitcoin Core. Let alone the fact that you'd also need to port the code to it in the first place.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:11:43

shapeshift.io seems to release your BTC once the BCH transaction reaches 3 confirmations. But the rate is probably worse.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:44:33
Yeah, but it varies all the time. One minute it's low, and the next it's somewhat higher. I saw all kinds of values ranging from 0.05 BCH to 9 BCH. I'm not sure why that is, though, maybe something about how much BTC they have ready for release at any given moment?
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:18:51
Your BTC is unaffected. If you want, you can keep on using the wallet that you normally use, and pretend this new fork never happened. The value of BTC might drop somewhat within some time, though. Or it might not. Nobody knows (even though some pretend to be able to see the future).
On the other hand, if you want to, you have just been given the same amount in Bitcoin Cash that you already have in BTC. So if you have 4.5 BTC, you will have 4.5 Bitcoin Cash in addition. The value of that Bitcoin Cash will probably not be the same as the value of your BTC, though. Also, you will have to go through a few loops to get your hands on those Bitcoin Cash. There will probably be detailed guides on how to access your Bitcoin Cash within a few days, or maybe even now. When you have access to your Bitcoin Cash, you can do with it as you please: Hodl it, sell it for BTC at whatever it's worth at the time, or just ignore it. Your choice.

The rate when I sold this afternoon, European time, was around 0.095 BTC per BCH.
Edit: Time perspective (currently 4 hours since last block, and 8 hours since the one before that)
@_date: 2016-12-06 11:33:41
In the eyes of the Bitcoin network, the coins have only been sent when they are in a block that has been confirmed. This is what you are waiting for to happen.
Of course, your wallet software will mark the coins as spent as soon as you publish the transaction. Otherwise it would be too easy to mistakenly do a double-spend.
So, the trick is, as tito13kfm writes:


The "other wallet" might be on another computer, if you have one available. Or as another user on the same computer. These are probably the easiest ways to do it.
So, when you feed your private keys into the "other wallet", this wallet will not know of your transaction (because it's not confirmed on the network), and you can make a new transaction with the same coins -- effectively doing a double-spend.

Depends how you read it, I suppose. He does write "on A private key", but perhaps emphasis was meant to be more on "private" than on "a"?

Remember, even though Netflix is pretty much global, it is FAR from the same movies and shows being offered all around. It is not exactly unheard of for e.g. European users to use VPN services or other tricks in order to subscribe to American Netflix, simply because of the much larger selection there.

With a 64 GB SD card and a harddrive for the blockchain, you have plenty of space to leave the GUI there and not uninstall it. Because of the Pi's low amount of RAM, I would still advise to let it boot to CLI (command line interface), and then you can always start the GUI using the command 'startx' if you need it temporarily to set something up.
I haven't done any measuring or testing of this, but with only 1 GB of RAM you probably want to make as much as possible of it available to bitcoind, especially during sync with the blockchain.
You can of course choose to let the swapfile stay on the SD card. I guess you'd have to measure in order to be able to tell which is best speedwise (bear in mind the harddrive being connected through USB2 on the same controller as the Ethernet port). But in the long run it is probably better to put the swapfile on the harddrive, since a HDD is much more durable when it comes to the intense read/write action of swapping, longterm.

Hmm... Actually, as a translator, I prefer Transifex over Crowdin. Crowdin has sort of a voting system for which translations of a string are the best. I would imagine it would be hard to ensure consistency throughout an app if its translations already have many votes. Transifex uses a more traditional translate/proofread model, which also seems closer to how the gettext system (.po files) works.
Anyway, I guess it's just a matter of taste. I actually tend to use more time on a translation in Crowdin than in Transifex.

You have a point. I have heard it before, and I agree to it. However I can think of a very often occurring situation where a store doesn't want to wait, *and* doesn't want to trust a 0-confirmation tx:
At some point I worked in a store that sold everything from food to electronics (something like Walmart, probably). Often people would buy for what equals to several hundred, or even a thousand or two USD -- new TV, surround sound set, etc. The store was very careful in accepting credit card payments for these sorts of buys, so in a situation where they would accept bitcoin, they certainly wouldn't accept a 0-conf tx. On the other hand, you don't want to hold up the line for 5, 10, 20 minutes, letting both the customer and others behind them wait for a confirmation. I hope this is something that someone will think out a clever way of addressing.

Since Armory runs  Bitcoin Core in the background, yes, you are running a full node when you run Armory. Running a full node to support the network is not a priority to Armory, though, it's just what comes with running Bitcoin Core, so Armory doesn't have any features specific for that purpose, other than if Armory is running, you know that Bitcoin Core is running.
I'm not sure what exactly you mean by "see my node". Maybe [bitnodes.io]( will help you?
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:07:41


There's also the (more "old-fashioned", I guess?) approach of using an offline software wallet, e.g. through [Armory](
This involves storing your private keys in an instance of Armory on a computer that is not connected to the Internet, and never will be, and also running Armory on an online computer.
You can then see your balance on the online computer, and use it to generate addresses when you want to send funds to the offline wallet. But you cannot spend from the wallet using the online computer alone.
So only when you want to actually spend from the offline wallet (which I guess will not be too often), you will have to turn the offline computer. You then initiate the transaction on the online computer, take the transaction to the offline computer (as a file on a USB stock, etc.) to sign it with your private key, and then take it back to the online computer to publish it it the Bitcoin network.
Everything is done through a graphical user interface, both on the online and the offline computer.

I've seen this "I'm in, if there is enough support" before. Maybe UASF would gain more support (and please correct me if I'm mistaken) if you make it clear that:
- letting your node signal UASF support through uacomment means letting the world know that you support UASF "if there is enough support".
- running an actual UASF node means letting the world know that you support UASF unconditionally.

Not those already added. I succesfully added my Visa card shortly after Circle launched, and it worked until my bank decided they needed a new logo and sent all customers new credit cards and closed the old ones. I'm not able to add my new Visa card to Circle, even though it's the exact same type of card through the same bank. I got in touch with Circle helpdesk, which was not able to help, basically because they don't officially support non-US cards.

If price makes Trezor and Ledger Wallet a no-go, and you're somewhat technical minded, you might want to consider a cold wallet on an old offline laptop. I use [Armory]( for this. Spending from the cold wallet is a bit cumbersome (adding funds to it is a breeze), but I guess the point is not to do that if you want to hodl, and you use it in combination with a hot wallet for daily use (Armory supports multiple simultaneous wallets, I guess other software does the same)

If your old Casio calculator has at least a couple of GB RAM (or the ability to swap to that amount), more than 100 GB free storage space (unless you're pruning, in which case just a few GB should be enough), a relatively powerful CPU (probably at least in the 1 GHz region), and runs one of the more popular Intel/ARM architectures or you have the ability to compile it to your architecture yourself -- then you should be fine. But then I think we're well past the ELI5 stage... :-)

As a private person, I needed a way to easily send a Bitcoin payment request to another person by email/chat/similar, including a QR code and "bitcoin:" link. In my case, I had sold some old stuff through one of the major auction sites.
My wallet software doesn't do that, and I noticed that a few others don't as well, or does it in a way that I don't quite like, so I made a simple website that lets you create a payment request and send the link to whomever you want to receive bitcoin from.

Last month I did a quite comprehensive [guide to setting up a Bitcoin node on a Raspberry Pi 3]( which I have later adjusted to optionally support UASF.
I don't know if it falls into the ELI5 category, since you need to not be afraid of using the terminal (command line), but everything is explained in detail, so even if you don't have much command line experience, you should be able to follow it.

"streetcornerkid" assumes you are using Bitcoin Core as your wallet software. "wallet.dat" is the file that Bitcoin Core uses to store your wallet data.
I would recommend to use software (or hardware) where you can make a backup on paper instead, especially if we are talking long term backup. Preferably in old-fashioned pencil or something else that won't fade away in time. Noone can really guarantee that a file on a USB drive will still be there after being untouched for many years.

Yeah, after you create a Transifex account, go to Andreas' language team and apply for membership of the language that you want to translate into. If you're the first to do so, Andreas (or someone that he has assigned project co-admin, if he has that) has to approve you, and then you'll be coordinator for that language. If someone is already translating into your language as a language coordinator, they can also approve your application, in which case you'll join the language with a "translator" status.

Yes. Advanced people will definitely feel right at home with Armory.
If implicitly you then also say that it is NOT for non-advanced or semi-advanced people, then I don't agree.
I think Armory is not for anyone. I can think of many people who would be lost with Armory. But that may be the case with most Bitcoin wallet software. I think Armory should be no problem for anyone who has some basic computer maintenance skills, i.e. being able to install programs themselves, keep the system updated, etc.
Yes, Armory has a LOT of features. But everything is actually very well explained directly in the graphical interface. And rarely you will have to resort to command line and console windows in order to do advanced stuff. There's always a button and a guiding window for it, unlike Bitcoin Core which only lets you do relatively basic stuff in the graphical interface.
But maybe the sheer amount of features and buttons scares some people, even though they would be able to just ignore everything they don't need. Creating a simple transaction, or letting the app show a QR code containing the next address is just as simple in Armory as in any other desktop wallet.
Actually, there's a "Simple/Experienced" toggle, but I don't know how much the "Simple" setting removes from the graphical interface.
Then, of course there's the issue of having to maintain a synced node in order for Amory to be able to show your updated balances. I don't see it as a problem, but perhaps it would be nice if Armory could run in SPC mode for just one session if you were in a hurry.

Yeah, that's a paper wallet. So, there are paper wallets and paper backups of software or hardware wallets.
Some people prefer paper wallets. This is where you print this piece of paper that essentially acts as your wallet, and you'll only need software in case you want to remove bitcoins from it.
What I meant was a paper backup, i.e. using "ordinary" wallet software (e.g. Electrum or others) to handle incoming and outgoing transactions, but then make a backup of your wallet on that software on paper. Most software wallets let you do this by presenting you with a 12 to 24 word phrase that you should put down on paper and keep somewhere safe. The good thing is, by saving this phrase just once, you will have a backup of your wallet, including all future transactions to/from it.
When you are comfortable with this concept, you should move your funds to an offline wallet of which you make a paper backup. An offline wallet means like above, but the backup phrase (and thereby the socalled private keys from which your phrase was derived, and which is essentially your wallet itself) is stored on and only on a computer that will never be connected to the internet, or on a hardware device which was manufactured for the purpose (i.e. a hardware wallet, e.g. Trezor). If you want to use paper wallets, they should also be generated on a computer which is not connected to the Internet.

Assuming you already have the PC set up with an OS (Linux, Windows, etc.), you'd basically just download and run the [UASF enabled version of Bitcoin Core]( and open port 8333 in your router/firewall.
Note though, that the software will download the complete blockchain to your computer which will take many hours or even days, depending on your hardware, and take up more than 100 GB of harddisk space unless you configure it to use pruning.

VERSION 0.93
Released Feb 21, 2015
* **Compatible with Bitcoin Core 0.10 and "headers-first"**
        The most recent version of Bitcoin Core includes a parallel network
        synchronization feature called "headers-first" which is incompatible
        with previous versions of Armory.  This version is required to use
        Bitcoin Core 0.10 and newer.  Torrent-based bootstrapping will 
        be removed in the next version of Armory.
* **New Scalable Blockchain Engine**
        This version of Armory will look very similar to previous versions,
        but actually has a completely new, scalable database engine (using
        LMDB instead of LevelDB).  The engine can now handle wallets with
        millions of addresses and transactions!
* **Rebuild Required (but much faster!)**
        The new database engine requires rebuilding and rescanning.  You
        will be prompted as soon as you start up 0.93 the first time.  
        However, due to the new blockchain engine, this process is
        considerably faster than before.  Generally less than 45 min!
        NOTE: This is NOT redownloading the blockchain. It is only 
        rebuilding the local databases that Armory creates for itself.
        
* **Improved Threading and Reliability**
        With the new backend comes overhauled inter-thread messaging.  This 
        resolves a whole class of reliability issues that Armory has had in 
        the past, especially with large wallets and transaction histories.  
* **Address and Wallet Importing in Background**
        Importing wallets and addresses now induces background scans which
        do not disable the interface (previously forced you into offline
        mode for the duration of the scan).  
        
* **Supernode Mode**
        Use the "--supernode" flag before creating the databases to create
        a supernode database that enables instant address &amp; wallet import.
        This is an enabling feature for high-volume, consumer facing apps 
        and services to be built on Armory, such as exchanges and block-
        explorers.  NOTE: Running with --supernode will result in an Armory
        database approximately double the size of the blockchain!  
        
* **Improved armoryd.py**
        The daemon version of armory, armoryd.py, has been fully updated and
        tested with the new database engine.  Also includes a new "webshop"
        sample application that demonstrates basic usage of armoryd.py to 
        collect &amp; verify payments, generate unsigned transactions, etc.
* **RFC6979 Deteministic Signing (via CLI args)**
        Armory now has a deterministic signing mode based on RFC6979.  
        The code passes all test vectors, but disabled by default pending
        more rigorous review.  It can be enabled using the --detsign 
        command-line flag.

There's a button for that (from memory, it says something like "Copy raw tx text" or similar) in the offline transaction window. So on your online computer, right after loading your transaction file that you signed on your offline computer, you click this button, and then you're ready to paste the transaction into one of the URLs above.
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:04:35
That sounds like a reaally great idea. Do you think you can collect 1 BTC per week from ads and sponsors/donors alone?
Also, will you be able to somehow filter out fake nodes?
I've been running a full node close to 24/7 for several months now. Mainly doing it because I want to support the network, and this is how I'm able to do so, but I believe an incentive programme such as this will get more people to run full nodes.

Yes, it seems they enabled download from within Armory first, then a few hours later they posted the direct download links on bitcointalk, and then hopefully a few hours later still they will update the download section of their website.

Short answer: Get/have a computer or some other hardware that you can run 24/7, download and run the [UASF enabled version of Bitcoin Core]( on it, and open incoming port 8333 in your router/firewall.
You might want to mind power consumption of the hardware. For this reason I'm running my node on a Raspberry Pi 3 which uses 2-4 watt at full load, in contrast to the 100+ watt that a standard PC typically consumes.
I wrote a [comprehensive guide to running a node on a Raspberry Pi 3]( which I have updated for UASF support (only 1 small change to running standard Bitcoin Core).
@_date: 2015-02-22 11:23:39
Actually it depends on bitcoind, so if your operating system allows you to install bitcoind without the graphical part (Ubuntu does), that would be enough.
If you refer to the fact that you need the entire blockchain on your harddisk, that's true, but they seem to be planning a lite version that doesn't require this for the sacrifice of some security (having to trust someone else to keep the blockchain for you).

Either way, with your paper backup of your Armory wallet (you *do* have one, right?), you will always be able to recover your funds when you have Armory back up running.
You did right in letting Armory delete your old database (this is not your wallet!) because from this version Armory's internal database files are of a different format than before, so it needs to recreate the database.
I'm no Armory expert, just a normal user, but if this was me, my next step would be to completely delete Armory's data directory (under Linux, this is ~/.armory -- you don't say which OS you're on) and then restart Armory and let it do its thing from scratch. *Make sure you have your paper backup handy before doing this!*
If that doesn't help either, I would also delete bitcoind's data directory ( ~/.bitcoin under Linux) and let it redownload the block chain.

Assuming you didn't survive, your loved ones will go get your backup/seed at the place where you told them to look beforehand in a situation like that.


Then you go fetch your second backup that you have stored somewhere physically detached from your house.


Then you go fetch that second backup quickly and transfer the funds to a new wallet, before the thief is able to crack your encrypted wallet. Which he probably won't be able to anyway, because you used a secure password to encrypt it, but still.

Since you're asking: Mining hashrate has nothing to do with it being a full node or not. The "full" part describes that it fully validates transactions and blocks.


So, according to this, you might even have a full node that does *not* relay, though most do.

I'd imagine that's what OP meant. Buy at exchanges, but as soon as your BTC lands in your wallet there, transfer it to your own desktop/hardware/paper/whatever wallet. That's what I do, and it's what I generally recommend.
As long as your BTC is at the exchange, it's just a number in their system. As soon as you transfer it away from the exhange, it enters the Bitcoin network and becomes "real" BTC, so to say. More importantly, only at that point, you (and only you) control it.

I'm not OP, but go to ebay.com and search for "bitcoin coin". Look for the best price, which will probably be from China/Hong Kong/etc. And the cheaper you go, the more you need to take the "gold plated" or "silver plated" part of the description with a grain of salt.
I have a couple of these. They actually feel nice and heavy as you'd expect from a solid metal coin. Better quality (also in the print detail) than I'd expect from some of these Chinese sellers. Except on the precious metal part of the deal, of course :-)
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:46:12
If the transaction is not time critical, you could wait for it to time out in the mem pool (a good indicator for this is probably when blockchain browsers don't list it anymore), then let Armory forget about it using "Help" -&gt; "Clear All Unconfirmed", then create a new transaction with a better fee.
You might also consider using ViaBTC's transaction accelerator. It might be hard to get your transaction in their queue (it fills pretty quickly), but once it's there, you're pretty much safe.
