First a secure os, then bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-14 01:52:35
Sure, we (will) fully support offline mode or read only modes.

With stealth addresses the only thing that get's 'disconnecte'd is the public address (the stealth address that can be disclosed) from the destination appearing in the blockchain.
With mixing you introduce a 50% uncertainty on every mix so you can still see it but you can't be totally sure about the origin.

We have a infrastructure of gateway + obelisk which serve as a basis for the darkwallet working as a light wallet on the client side.
The gateways connect in a (very simplistic) p2p cloud to each other and you can configure one.
Full node would be all software together (at the moment 2 daemons + darkwallet), but we are aiming for having daemons in servers.

We haven't fully specified the system yet, but we have a lot of documentation and all the code is open source:

We are making tools to preserve privacy, critical to preserve bitcoin fungibility, as well as people's safety.
You may want to read the following about the subject:
 (gmaxwell)
 (Adam Back)
When we have to choose among control and freedom we will choose freedom. Lots of rules, as we know, help the gangsters, and we promote solving social problems by spawning real discussion. We make tools to enforce freedom.
If you are interested in social aspects:
As an abstract you can consider "the people" feels threatened by all those rules enforcing us paying constant fees and taxes to proven criminals, when those resources can be better put to the good of society.
I hope that clears a bit for you where we are coming from, and it's definitely not promoting "bad" behaviour, much on the other side, we want to promote much better behaviour, responsibility, empathy, sustainability, ecology, etc, but treating people as sheeple doesn't help and yes... the rules help the criminals.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:46:46
We're now entering final stabilization so this is getting closer, all depends what you consider "safe" and how you use it.
About release schedule, we hope we can have a beta in around 1 month, and production one more after or something like that, so we have plenty of time to test and prepare it.
@_date: 2014-06-18 09:16:33
We've been fixing many issues, also I guess you have been a bit unlucky since we've never had such long downtimes from our gateways.
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:53:54
Hi ppl I am one of the developers working on darkwallet.
I can confirm we have been working there for 6 months approx, from february to july or so. The people in the squat there where so nice as to let us stay there for 6 months so we could focus on darkwallet, which we did.
We have since changed dev center and now stablished a new one with new plans in another area of Spain -Castellón-.
From Darkwallet team we send all our support to Kasa de la Muntanya and the nice peoples there. Thanks to people like those (and many others) the world changes a bit to the better.. they deserve all the support they can get.
Thanks a lot to everyone for the support and for caring!

DD is american but we're not, let's keep this at the people level ;-)
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:34:18
Mixing and stealth are two different techniques, both in the above document describing the alpha.
@_date: 2014-04-14 01:43:28
Didn't say we are one or the other... personally I think we are to shatter those old mythologies made to divide people. We will always be tagged as something else... for the anarchists too capitalists, for the communists too socialists, for the socialists too capitalist...
We're just people just like you. :-)
@_date: 2014-06-23 06:42:06
Yes, for now we have the mediawiki plugin that sem made (check the release notes for detailed explanation).
And its activated in our wiki.unsystem.net so you can try in a real world example.
The mechanism is simple enough that should be a relatively easy task to implement, so people is encouraged to implement it for their favourite platform.
@_date: 2014-09-08 00:41:26
AGPL would make agencies be infringing on the license if they modify the code and not release the source :-P
Interaction with other (possibly proprietary) platforms that can always be done over networking.
I call shooting in the foot on this one :P. Anyways if this is what the developers like I applaud their autonomy.
@_date: 2014-06-23 06:45:01
we're not completely sure we have a roadmap at  we hope max 1 or 2 months till the beta (conservative estimate).
It can be safe to use with real bitcoins before that also with features like 2of3 pockets, multisig etc.
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:45:47
Even better :)
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:19:29
It's a simple two people mix.
The strategy is documented at: 
Anyways, Bob publishes an announcement over intent to make a transaction, along with his public key. Alice and possibly others answer in an encrypted message with inputs to mix. Bob chooses a peer and continues with a protocol oriented to produce a shared transaction with inputs and outputs mixed, matching on one of the outputs.
You can see a mixed tx at: c55eaacff0abd23e339f299a12f302379626ed75917d1b5da98186e9c20add45
All communications are done with curve 25519 signatures and diffie hellman so only the two participants in the mix know the inputs and outputs, but this is not set in stone.
We thought this model is similar to other more ellaborate models with an adversary fully controlling the other side and while it doesn't give perfect guarantees it's still practical enough to succeed with few participants or doing a casual mix.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:48:35
We're aiming for the full release and big freeze towards the end of the year (we've scheduled 3 more months for the release).
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:12:33
You are wise, sir :). Anyways, you can try without sending any funds... but we don't advise testing for non-technical users yet.
We will release alpha with testnet support so ppl will be able to play with testcoins for a while till we get everything rock solid.
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:00:10
At this point I would recommend electrum and definitely don't generate keys in a webpage like that (about bitaddress.org).
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:51:01
Darkwallet is a bitcoin wallet.
We will review the intro though and see how it can be made more clear.
@_date: 2014-06-23 08:47:01
Yep, we're thinking about implementing schemes like this, not specially for donations to darkwallet but as a general mechanism, also so the "budget" for donations is good to put into the coinjoin queue too since it's the kind of spend that doesn't care so much about sending everything in a specific amount. In a way could work kind of like flatter (regarding weighting and budgeting) does but with total control for the user.
There are lots of possibilities ahead!
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:11:12

stealth addresses works because the address you publish or give to people it's never the same as appears in the blockchain, so they can't be correlated
ie, I give you my stealth address, you can't tell which transactions where sent to me on that address
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:15:01
stealth works by people sharing stealth addresses instead of regular ones.
mixing works by meeting in a lobby
no data is stored on the servers, communications are encrypted client to client, although they do pass through a server chatroom (which is more like a distributed thread subscription system than chatroom system)
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:53:24
Don't think extensions are much harder to install than normal apps, also the experience of installing is the same on different os.
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:52:32
We can integrate different functionalities and a very important part is having the wallet owning a set of keys about your online identity. This will soon be used for logging into websites.
We agree this is a weaker spot in the computer security but bitcoin can be secured even if your computer is completely compromised so we just have to aim for higher security.
Besides, for the amount of functionality we are adding in there this approach gives us lots of flexibility, and js is a popular wallet language anyways so we support that community in using it.
There exists the possibility of later running on some other core (most of our js doesn't depend on the browser) that's not a browser, as a stand alone app, or even making a desktop/android one, we will see.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:10:32
Well, the slider is not final... also we're still working on getting the interface for multisig to be really nice.
At the moment you can create, import and watch multisig funds, then you can spend from them, but we're missing the gui for importing signatures or making it go with internal communications system to save ppl copy and paste.
@_date: 2014-10-31 04:57:16
first targets are chrome and firefox, so there is no date for android.
check out the thread in our forum for more info: 
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:15:29
We (darkwallet) do not send the scan key (or any other key) to the server.
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:19:12
Anyways I'm not saying it's going to work for sure or even they care, but this is an interesting possibility and you can even put a big warning in your README to make sure they know.
I think it's funny (and realistic) to think AGPL makes law enforcement agencies break the law if setting up bad nodes XD.
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:40:58
The darkmarket is a different project (and its just proof of concept!).
At this moment our immediate is not to work in a totally p2p way. DarkMarket is a totally experimental approach we have made it too .. :P... in 24 hours.
We aim for becoming independent of the servers, for now we aim to be *protected* from them and protecting our privacy and anonymity (in pure p2p you have also a problem because you dont want just giving your ip to all your peers).
With darkwallet you will eventually be able to use p2p networks for message distribution, or just about anything, we have designed the wallet so we just don't trust any servers (for the communication or lobby part) so right now we're doing it in our lobby since we have to go somewhere.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:28:53
We don't promote illegal activities. We provide protection.
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:09:45
seems the testnet server is having some issues syncing with the network the backend team is looking into this, you can track this issue here: 
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:36:29
The following document describes the best way to upgrade without losing previous data:
Otherwise you will be able to recover from backup (preferably) or seed (you need to regenerate addresses and/or pockets manually to see funds)
@_date: 2014-04-04 23:29:34
We're now pre-alpha that's why there are no release numbers yet. Once we start with proper releases (alpha and beyond) you can be sure every package will go with its version number.
Now you have to follow the git commit number :-P (
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:24:27
it would be the same.
sending the *publickeys" over some secure communication channel would be an alternative to stealth, but with stealth its just an address and no other communication is needed
about mixing, the effect is when you send to each other, you cant be sure which inputs are from each other. no matter how you get the pubkey, your peer can still see where the funds come from if no mixing is used.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:21:46
The first version is going to be bitcoin only (well and testnet coin but maybe not at the same time). This way we avoid some complexity and also can deliver on the initial promises.
For next stage we're totally considering make it multi-currency (and other goals). Should be easy and at least with some coins looks like we can even use the same bip32 tree, one key, many currencies.
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:58:10
We think we can change the world by changing money flows (not only but it's a very important part of daily life), a  very important one being the one from our  own pockets. Money must flow from the top of the pyramid to the bottom, not the other way around.
When you pay or work to those having more and generally working for themselves, you're enforcing the status quo. That we can haz some money doesn't mean we have to use it to pay a rent (a scam where ppl who have less pay to those having more), get luxury goods etc, we can use the money to support proper causes, collectivizations, infrastructure that we will need (hospitals etc). Of course so we can eat, and those around us can eat as well too.
It's not going to happen if we just keep throwing our money at "them" and then complaining.
If everyone paying rents would start buying off lands, if those paying daily to corporations put just a little into commons plans. Imagine what one million people can do with 1 milli bitcoin each, any given day. Apart from take one beer each. Think what we can do with that.
When we're complaining about nobody setup the hospitals we just complain about our own lack of imagination. Complaining about improper use of "property" when ppl just stack propery, keep it empty, speculate, the banks end with all after "crisis". Besides, the property is planet earth, and we're severely fscking it.
With the proper tools we will make it.
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:39:19
If you're sending all your data to google already there's not much we can do.
But there are ways we can offer the wallet so it doesn't come from google website even if you use chromium/chrome. We don't have final details about how we will approach production distribution, but you can tell we're not big fans of giving any info to google.
@_date: 2014-06-24 07:36:44
there are many reasons....
I think we may want to use other crypto systems like gpg instead of bitcoin for login, but we think of the wallet where you put your keys that can be for other things than currency.
also you can see it like, if you have to take great length to protect funds why do the same to protect logins too? can't part of the code be reused?
also, you can use different identities if you want to separate the security (so you don't unlock any account with funds), otherwise we also use different keys for login than the addresses we give the user to send and receive money.
identity and authentication are deeply rooted in our wallet as well as communication features that we believe are needed to have a fully functional wallet.
anyways we will think later about separating some parts of darkwallet into different apps so their functionality can be expanded, but regarding identity/keys management we totally think the wallet is where it's at.
@_date: 2014-05-16 03:59:33
Stealth makes it so nobody can correlate your public (stealth) address with blockchain transactions.
CoinJoin as we do it atm introduces 50% uncertainty in every shared transaction.
See  for more details on CoinJoin and a very good explanation and rationale by gmaxwell.
@_date: 2014-10-20 19:13:51
yes it's coming soon
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:26:07
The donation address of nodes can be easily accessible and also later people can setup pay only nodes or offer other services.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:51:14
And even more ways to help: 
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:20:02
works but you only see others when they talk at the moment
@_date: 2014-10-21 09:44:43
At the moment it's supported in darkwallet and it allows sending and receiving stealth transactions. Afaik other clients like electrum are getting some stealth support soon.
@_date: 2014-05-01 09:46:04
Devs here:
More technical in-depth documentation:
As it says, it's alpha, we would like people to check on coinjoin, stealth, lobby and communication mechanics and give feedback. 
Supports testnet for testing with play money. Don' t put real bitcoins there unless you're a dev and really know what you are doing.

It's getting implemented on a new api on the backend, check: 
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:40:05
We are to bitcoin what bittorrent client is to bittorrent protocol.
We make tools. In a way we don't make anything possible which isn't already possible.
Also, we work on financial privacy and protecting people and peoples funds... from the hands of big mafias, and misguided/corrupt interests, in a critical moment when not many or enough people are working hard enough.
Honestly don't know why the US government would have any problem (or other American governments)...
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:09:18
Maybe try to get some of the testnet faucets to implement it, that would be a good start.
Other wallets are working on them but not sure how is the status.
First time I hear of the term routing address, btw.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:18:22
DarkWallet is a wallet not a coin.
DarkWallet will be bitcoin only for the first release, but later it can support other alts like darkcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:50:08
The wallet implements a form of coinjoin now. We try to keep something usable while looking for more advanced protocols that work (like coinshuffle).
More important we have the wallets share a communication medium favourable for implementing more complex protocols over what we have now.
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:26:49
You can do multisig now, we will have hardware support (like trezor) and offline signing.
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:20:05
We do everything in javascript so we have no issues with having to compile for different platforms, while being able to run as a browser plugin, but also later as stand alone or in other environments. As a browser plugin we have some advantages regarding interaction with the web.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:48:14
We will look into it. Our base mechanics allow for implementing coinshuffle or other more elaborate coinjoin protocols on top of what we have.
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:21:38
also, we do not think their store policies are necessarily evil (they are protecting clueless users), but giving them the complete distribution "rights" (even the distribution private key) is seeming like kind of a blocker.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:40:21
Well in the end we're not using so much of cryptocat, although we are using the same encryption system (25519 curves) and atm calculate cloak fingerprint like them. Will probably reuse some of their code for group chat later.
So, we have different assumptions, for one we're not using xmpp, we work on top of our own p2p broadcast medium, and can be switched by a different one later or something like irc (although we don't assume usernames or user identification).
So now its peer to peer and encrypted, some more details about our current system at:

The actual part with expenses and income is:
the top of the document is about the current funding campaign (that doesn't totally reflect our expenses and income yet btw)
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:37:54
Good description, only with "official" stealth the "nonce" (actually an ephemeral key) is published so only the receiver can DH over the ephemeral key and see if the payment matches for her. There is a nonce but it's used for something else (to "mine" the transaction hash to get some prefix so we won't scan all possible transactions, just ones that match some prefix for us.
So, we put this extra data in the blockchain (not through other channels) for two reasons:
1. So you can recover your funds deterministically from your seed, without extra data from other backups
2. Because if you have other communication channel you can as well send a one time address to your contact anyways
For more information check our dw implementation:
* 
And our wiki:
* 
About the "scanning key", the issue here is we need one secret key from the receiver to actually even know we've been payed. With normal addresses we will just need access to the secret key for spending after receiving them.
So, we use two keys, one is for scanning, we assume the client has that key "unguarded" or "hot" meaning the wallet can use it without the user inputing any password. The funds are still sent to a different key, so to spend the user still needs to use one of her locked (cold or locked) keys.
Finally, when using bip32 wallet, like we do, the scanning key needs to be "hardened" (meaning it's from a private derivation so if it's compromised it doesn't compromise the whole tree). The spending key is a normal key and we assume it will be accessed in more secure conditions (or could be cold walleted or whatever).
Afaik, Peter Todd will be writing a proper bip soon explaining it.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:49:42
It's difficult to quantify like that, but mixing makes transaction analysis more difficult and stealth makes it so your publicly known address is never in the blockchain.
check the following docs for more info:

Sorry about that.
We have added a notice in the old webpage
 We're migrating to the new domain and some things like ssl certificate are still missing there but it's legit. It's the *new darkwallet webpage*

Not yet but can be done easily. Will be done as part of the polishing between alpha and beta.
@_date: 2014-04-14 01:52:07
Secret keys are now encrypted with aes 256 bit.
Other content from the wallet is not encrypted at the moment but the idea is you can also open and close an identity and then everything will be enclosed into an encrypted blob only you can open (or maybe find).
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:15:32
Maybe a judge would care.
Also, GPL is not like AGPL, maybe you want to check it out a bit, but AGPL makes sure you need to distribute the code if you're running the modified code in your server/node.
AGPL was designed by the FSF precisely because you could run modified GPL code in your server/node without releasing sources. AGPL counters that.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:29:43
Yes there will be more import/export options including raw private keys, the option is not there yet.
@_date: 2014-10-20 16:03:13
best is to use our forums  (there is a section for darkwallet)
we also have a mailing list:  or irc  at freenode

1. We are 100% Free software: 
Besides we have different focus on how to make a client (for example we put code in folders), some common ideas and framework too (js crypto and bitcoin). Also atm they're more focused as a webpage, we're more focused as a browser plugin atm.
Also on the backend we also have a 100% free software and new infrastructure for bitcoin (libbitcoin, obelisk), this is not just another frontend for the old bitcoin stuff.
Anyways, they do release a lot as opensource, and also implement ideas we like, I predict much interoperability between both wallets.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:09:00
We just made an update on reddit a few days ago: 
Regarding watch only pockets, we're scheduling that for a bit after the alpha. 
About stealth addresses, we have one per pocket, but that may change. Also we're still finishing testing the latest spec for stealth.
Anyways, thanks for testing us!

answered, thx for pointing that out!
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:10:06
Don't think you're getting it to be honest. I'll try with an example to see if you can understand what this is about:
Let's say some person is trying to publish a forbidden book and use a bitcoin address to get financed and continue working and publishing forbidden material, if they just post their bitcoin address, the government totally knows their address, who can then trace any transactions starting there, even manage to get ips etc.
If the publisher uses their stealth address, government doesn't know which transactions are theirs even when ppl are paying. And that's it. No way to follow the money afterwards.
@_date: 2014-04-14 01:45:34
Our reasons:
@_date: 2014-06-23 10:43:29
Totally, we want still to stabilize the wallet core a bit but we will make a firefox port before going beta (and also open the door for other "ports").
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:27:15
For people upgrading from 0.6, very important to read:
We are changing addresses here and some old ones are discontinued in this release.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:51:43
Means to just focus on stability, without accepting any new features.
@_date: 2014-10-21 09:37:46
not yet, also I don't think we got any trezor's for testing yet
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:45:03
The private keys are encrypted with aes 256, also you can use multisig funds that you can control from several devices or applications.
So, unless you are using multisig or external factors (some is possible and we will be adding more) we can't be much more secure than your browser or ultimately your computer.
That said we want the darkwallet to be safe to use from an unsafe computer, by using mechanisms like the above.
@_date: 2014-10-21 09:45:22
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:13:59
Firefox will come later.
About chromium it works just like on chrome. We actually develop on chromium and hardly ever use vanilla chrome.
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:17:45
Ok added something there, thx for the remarks!
@_date: 2014-06-24 07:37:40
You can use it with testnet, in canada.
@_date: 2014-05-09 07:26:32
It's going to download and scan stealth data initially and we don't have this offloaded to background task so it will hog your gui. Let it think for a bit and it will finish. We will work on this issue for next release.
The only reason why maybe alpha1 maybe seemed to be better is because it had some bugs and wasn't scanning properly. Anyways keep us updated and if the issue continues please post at the github issue tracker: 
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:27:30
I think we're not open to the same problems but now is the moment to check it out :). I think the one informing about the shared coin problems is Peter Todd our chief scientist.
Also I think the problem is they claim "complete anonymity" which is a bit too much with this techniques.
We will be striving to have a way that both blockchain and us (and others) will use together and gives some guarantees (not complete anonymity just with coinjoin!).
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:32:19
As part of the dark wallet team,
For people who thinks squatting is too hardcore you know we also work on collectivizations.
We have been working in and promoting calafou ( before and now moved back around squats while we organize our next collectivization project (some notes):
Collectivize as in buying together to set up a community, together with the already existing efforts from the Cooperativa Integral, Enric Duran and many others and more joining all around the world.
We obviously think squatting is legitimate as long as the (generally corporate or state) owners have abandoned the building for a long time, and people use the place mindfully and creatively. We support them because they support us life shown me it's better to support those supporting you  than hear the mermaid songs from the system that just wants to scam and assimilate you.
World has a lot of problems and we won't be solving any if we don't organize, think a bit out of the box, learn... you know the deal. Don't just trust what you read. Think!

Basic coinjoin doesn't cost more than one normal transaction (you can save a tiny bit actually).
About the server knowing, the server can see (in our first idea of implementation) ppl announcing coinjoins but can't see who follows up as everything else is encrypted end to end with elliptic curves dh and .aes.
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:23:03
Which is why bsd is now so much like MacOSX.
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:56:38
Maybe the image here helps: 
Stealth makes it impossible to say which transactions are for the public address you give to people (your stealth address).
@_date: 2014-05-09 06:05:24
Not for now. Now is only for alpha testers and can be installed only as an extension in developer mode.
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:11:22
it's a bitcoin wallet focused on user privacy and security, as well as usage of more advanced bitcoin features like multisig funds
currently being implemented as a browser plugin for chrome and firefox, was crowdfunded late last year and is working towards a beta around the end of the year.
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:29:12
Just takes time and we want to do it once the core implementation is more stable so we don't do too much duplicate work.
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:33:37
To be honest we haven't decided yet, at least it's not an unconditional "yes" since the conditions are pretty leonine.
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:02:12
There is, but as the original authors value freedom (why we choose the AGPL, lol) we can approve the license change, end of story.
Again this is forfeiting possible legal defense here (see my other comment).
Btw, really proud of how the community has taken over :_).
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:57:17
We will sort out a way that everyone can get testnet coins easily don't think that should be a problem...
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:46:42
re identicons: 
re stealth/coinjoin: They are different techniques, stealth protects the receiver, coinjoin protects the sender.
re radar: you are right
@_date: 2014-06-23 08:27:19
The server infrastructure is p2p and with little work also personal nodes are supported where you connect with no intermediary "gateway".
Check out: 
Of course the current implementation is kind of proof of concept but we have the eye on a few interesting projects that can provide good medium for our client side overlay network and protocols wich is where we put our focus (at the moment at least).
As said, everyone is welcome to participate so we can go faster, everything is free software.
@_date: 2014-10-30 05:14:51
note that we currently have a multisig fund and document all transactions:
In the initial stage of the project we haven't had the projects funds in public addresses that's why the report. We don't feel the need to publish information that can compromise privacy and you have to trust us on those numbers but they are the real thing, and you can see they are not off the roof, actually the budget is so tight that if you read it i believe you will find it astonishing.
Anyways, I agree the title for the submission is a bit excessive.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:39:58
The difference is even if everyone knows what your Stealth address is, nobody can tell  wether you received any funds (only ppl who sent you funds know what they sent but not even what other ppl sent to the "same address").
This is totally unlike normal addresses, where everyone will know how many funds your hold in that address.
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:38:17
I already wrote to other original devs so we can write a statement about the relicense.
I'm aware while we don't write it they are in license breach and it's a bit of a shitty situation.
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:08:59
had an issue in the gateway it should be syncing fast now
about funds maybe its related to syncing, otherwise try the scanner
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:10:08
Yes we support all world currencies (averages coming from bitcoinaverage at the moment).
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:19:41
there are some plans but for now our first target is running as browser extension
@_date: 2014-06-23 05:11:51
just noticed this, we also made an "official" thread for the release: 
thx for helping with the diffusion.. :)
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:54:05
It relies on using different services but the goal is not needing trust on blockchain servers by using prefix filters and spv validation. The backend is also free software so you can run it too, we promote people running their own nodes.
@_date: 2014-06-24 08:06:40
There needs to be someone else listening for mixes (with a pocket set to mixing) and enough funds so they will negotiate a shared send. Read the link about hard mixing for more details.
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:48:55
Not at the moment, but it will be possible and probably easy to make (i heard they have some kind of browser plugin as well)
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:32:34
Don't think google should know wether you use the dark wallet or not. If chrome have spyware you can use chromium (possible right now) or firefox when it's ready.
Also, we're taking into account fingerprinting techniques and adequately designing so websites won't know you're using the dark wallet (unless you may decide to unmask by for example logging in using darkwallet keys).
Anyways, to answer your question... it may be possible to run a more stand alone of the current dark wallet both on desktop or mobile, otherwise we may consider later making an android and desktop client too following the same principles of dark wallet (most of our infraestructure is ready for desktop and android too).
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:14:04
hi, dark wallet dev here!
at the moment we only support install in developer mode so this doesn't affect us.
we will later think how to approach this, but at no point did we decide to trust the google store. we are working on chrome/chromium at the moment because of api details but as you know plan support firefox/iceweasel and later anything that can run our js core.
just to make it clear we do not trust google or google store.
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:21:57
the three fields are the name of the wallet, and the password for sending (two times), the seed will be asked later.
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:23:04
Maybe we can use "Enterprise policy" on windows..
@_date: 2014-04-14 01:50:00
We will investigate interaction with tor or i2p later but I think we can make the wallet work properly with them. For now they piggyback on the browser connection features so it should work over proxies or tor already (won't be careful about it now so it's not a good idea till we get some more things stabilized).
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:32:53
Also, where do you see us promoting illegal activities?
@_date: 2014-10-20 16:37:14
That's right about how stealth works.
About the mixing the more it's used the better for privacy.
@_date: 2014-09-08 00:38:02
with AGPL they couldn't just change the code to setup a honeypot or that would be infringing on the licence unless they release the code.
with MiT they don't have to worry about breaking the law while modifying the code to fsck ppl over
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:21:46
it works but may not always find a peer to mix (there is an advanced option to always mix or else not send).
by hardening we mean we have fixed situations where the mixer wouldn't finish a negotiation properly, or when one broken peer would abort mixes for other people sending.
now the mixer is smarter, although not yet perfect it now selects among several offers, and also checks peer inputs to see if they are not spent (as some examples of such hardening)
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:34:52
At the moment you can only send to stealth addresses from another darkwallet since it's a new mechanism. You can find one time addresses in the addresses tab on your spending pocket, you can also create new ones there.
With stealth address you don't need to give different addresses for privacy and the current interface is thought around the idea of having stealth address as your main address.
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:57:17
The following faucets may work as well:

@_date: 2014-04-05 13:51:23
It's "Stealth" and not "Steal" addresses. It's not for what you want (you can read about what you want -and why it's a bad idea to implement it in the network- here: 
You can read comments above where there is more info about Stealth.
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:31:03
We check all new stealth data ourselves (obelisk provides stealth nonces packed so we dont need to consume so much bandwith).
@_date: 2014-05-09 07:27:39
Probably, check: 
You should go to settings-&gt;tools-&gt;Fetch stealth and let it resync all stealth info. Afterwards it should be ok.
@_date: 2014-06-24 07:30:45
that looks like you aren't sending the host header and being sent to the wrong server (we use sni and have several domains on the same ip).
if the application sends the header the hostname should match on the wiki as you can see going to the webpage with your browser.
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:10:17
About the issues they identify on darkwallet:
About 1 (change linking) Our plan is tagging output to avoid merging different mixing levels.
About 3 (unique outputs), I'm not sure the author understands our claims don't go so far, we're only claiming one of the outputs is mixed and more mixing is better, which seems to lead from their explanation as well.
About 4, I see how this can be a problem with coinjoin or coinshuffle and needs more thought about possible counter measures against attackers. At the moment the only thing we can use is the outputs to be mixed have to have funds and be owned by the attacker and this might be used as tool against spam/fingerprinting attacks.
So, from the point of view of darkwallet, it's not really new information, we strive to solve this issues but also for now work on an initial stable version with something simple that's working to then focus on actual improvements (for which there are many options).
We still think with our current (imperfect but workable) tools and adoption of such privacy technologies by more wallets the privacy in bitcoin can be improved.
We thank the author for their analysis, and would like more people doing the same. Kudos
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:30:32
Sorry didnt see this before...
It currently runs on chrome on any computer (we recommend using open os like debian or ubuntu)
You can use chrome and chromium, and configure chromium to not send your information (its not just about the darkwallet).
We're now working on porting to firefox too.
The extension, well, we mean "Darkwallet". We'll try rewording this better.
Thanks for the feedback!

Means we've managed to make it so you can have the cash withdraw method operated from your wallet in an open source environment with no strings attached.
The service and others we aim to integrate intend to be quick methods to cash withdraw or get bitcoins that operate from your wallet and minimal identification requirements (our partners manage this simple service and want to advance this path).
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:51:16
The aim with this mechanism is money gets converted quickly and you hold it at the start and end of the process, so in this case:
- btc (in you wallet) -&gt; fiat (in your pocket) = ~30min (2 confirmations and time you get to an atm)
We hope soon (1-2 weeks) we also have a similar inverse process (fiat -&gt; btc)
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:06:42
At this point we don't have any arrangements and we're basing more on strategic decisions and passion. We have shared interests with these guys but they go beyond simple commercial interests, we work with them like we can work with the Integral Cooperative. Our common aim is bringing more people and advancing social technologies, environments for collaboration and peaceful change. (sounds weird but sometimes reality is stranger than fiction...)
Also our strategy, even if launched with Chip Chap, is open protocol  and endpoint).
Anyways we see both as "our products", we like finding new allies and "partners" and this is a step in that direction. The commercial brand is what allows us in this case to provide fast cash services that we actually believe in as a really great development on bitcoin ease of use.
So we are proud to be now partnered with Chip Chap / Telepay but it's actually informal (although real). We will keep working to the best interest of people and bitcoin, and hope we've bring them into our side as well.
I also remind you the project is free software and open and it'll just keep being like this since we strongly believe in what we're doing. Funny that it can be open source and at the same time we can have this situations, but this is bitcoin, and everyone is welcome to the party :D
@_date: 2015-01-24 00:15:07
Our relation is more or less commercial but so far we don't have any commercial arrangement, but more of an informal plan to work together and advance common strategies.
For now we have helped them integrate bitcoin, and they provide us with an api we can use, this opens new possibilities we didn't think before and we believe will help in having less reliance on centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:46:53
We just started to see about migrating to firefox, still will take a bit but you can check info here:

I don't agree with your claim also because I think you mixed the different issues, each number on my response corresponds to one of the issues in the op's article (note I use the numbering they use where there's only 3 issues assigned id's 1, 3 and 4).
The first excerpt you show is talking about mixing strategy (3), where we mix just one output by design on each coinjoin.
Then I'm saying we don't have any ddos (4) protections implemented at the moment, and are not aware of a perfect solution. This is worthy to investigate but it's not without options to try.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:53:09
Sent some coin, also the following faucets usually work all right:
(for any others looking for testnet coins)
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:34:54
hey nullc,
I think there has been some miscommunication or else, I have indeed tried to contact you directly about the coinjoin bounty and how to proceed. also tried to make it clear through amir and peter that i should be contacted directly.
I sent some email your way on 06/11/14 (when I thought was a good time to test).
maybe you overlooked the email but I also felt a bit dissapointed, also didn't want to be abrasive...
anyways, I'd be really happy to have direct conversation with you about this, as well as any feedback :).
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:03:33
there will be a version for every taste :)
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:45:13
I'm one of the main Darkwallet developers, and to clarify:
- First, we're 100% community funded and that's the only way we can actually fund the project. We've survived with donations since the beginning, we're also now underfunded, we have a main [donations page]( and more info at [our budget page](
- We are aiming for firefox port for release, also will be other ways to run it through cordova. We started with chromium because of a more stable api but we'll release soon with both.
- Regarding the techniques we're implementing like coinjoin and stealth, they are a first and important step in improving privacy for bitcoin users, also we're going much further and having coin control, hd with bip44, multisig support, our own anonymous yet trustful way to make contacts and stablish relations... you can see more info in our [wiki]( and [manual](
The project is taking long to finish, but you can help by participating and financing us, it's the only way things get done and mind we really believe in what we're doing and bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:01:01
Darkwallet doesn't earn money from the banks we are community based and independent project but open to entangle other people.
