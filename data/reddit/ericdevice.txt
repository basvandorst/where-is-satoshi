Did you do ANY research ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:21:46
It’s been like a month or 2, the pricerocketed up bc of the news hype. Don’t forget bitcoin is by far the coin with the most

Maybe somethings wrong with my electrum client it gave me a 26$ fee the other day lol

Wow interesting thanks for the insight

Sweet, how will segwut become more popular is that a decision the miners make over time?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:12:15
Yeah, time does move forward. And After this crypto incubation cycle with or without bust it will still. If you bought and held the correct stocks in 2000 you'd be rich now, same logic applies now I guess 
Microsoft and apple are both still around just a glance at the current landscape shows who the whack players are and who's for real
Edit and that market value was mostly pump anyway not real cash invested

Is this true? Do you have any numbers for this? I find it unlikely as the market cap of the biggest names is higher than the market cap of the bubble at its peak
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:45:34
It didn't end well for companies who were trash... and out of that 'bubble' came the biggest companies ever 
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:15:13
Are you a complete moron or what 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:36:12
I didn't call you a moron, fucking moron. I asked if you were one
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:35:17
Nad dude it's not disagreeing that I say calls for a ban its anti semitism what you just said is akin to saying "drawing lines isn't grounds for ban" when your drawing swasticas , feel free to correct my spelling there as I'm sure your quite familiar with it. Pos 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:16:57
Pathetic excuse for a human being mods please ban him this is clearly antisemitic 
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:45:57
Silly rabbit personal offense taken to a personal insult is quite different than blanket hate directed at a group of people. Me insulting you for shitty behavior isn't the same as antisemitism but honestly your not gonna change any opinions here haha. Moreover I never suggested you were a nazi I just explicated your faulty reasoning for you

I thought a ponzu scheme involved fraudulently misrepresenting returns that don't exist, if market forces cause these returns and a bubble centered around an overvalued shitty asset pop that's just a. Bubble not a ponzu scheme 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:55:35
Your kidding right 
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:46:18
Good night and good luck
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:17:03
I disagree with bigoted shit yea.... that's against teddits terms anyway   
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:37:04
Lol does the etc blockchain have the same functionality as eth? Or is etc a bitcoin esque version  of eth
