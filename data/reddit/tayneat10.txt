I'm not one to argue on the internet, but I am passionate about my job and I feel no individual should pay more than he or she absolutely must. With that being said....
See attached photo: 
This is an excerpt from an actual client of mine from  a Coinbase exported CSV file. This is the report most individuals use and is available to all Coinbase users. 
For simplicity, lets say client sold .25 Bitcoin 10/31/2017. At this point, if client uses FIFO he must sell his earliest purchased coins and lose the ability to utilize long-term capital gain treatment going forward. He doesn't want to do that. Client prefers to HODL and wants to minimize his tax in the current year while also holding his earliest purchased coins. In this example, the .143 Bitcoin purchased on 9/10/2017 is sold first because it has the highest basis. Then, .107 Bitcoin is sold from the lot purchased on 9/12/2017 since it has the next highest basis. This lot was not completely absolved like the former. Instead, .143 Bitcoin remain in this lot. Client minimizes tax by allocating the coins with the highest cost sold as basis in transaction.
That is an example of how specific identification is utilized in a real world example. You can argue until you're blue in the face but I do this everyday for people and have the authority to represent before the IRS.

... it is. All you’re doing is selling individual assets instead of arbitrarily assigning a method such as FIFO or LIFO. I’m not going to argue - I was more or less informing you of a potentially better method for your tax situation.

CPA here. Do you have a specific question or scenario? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:18:21
I don’t remember seeing anything in that notice that requires the FIFO method. I know if you can’t specifically identify which asset you sold you must use FIFO. That is the only requirement I can think of. Is thy what you’re referencing?

Sure thing! Like I said, I'm not trying to be a jerk. I just hate taxation and as CPA I feel that I can contribute to the crypto community with the situations I've gained knowledge from.

Gotcha. I’m a CPA and have had a few clients do trading with CryptoCurrency.  Was able to use the specific identification method to see their holdings in lots to minimize tax

What FIFO tax rules are you referencing? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:13:00
I see. I'm a CPA and can't think of a way off the top of my head haha

Thanks for the insight

Yeah, we may end up using Gemini - they seem to have a better system set up to handle business entitys.

I have a W-2 and a few security sales. Why would i waste the firms resources for a return i can do in ten minutes on turbo tax? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:39:17
I could - but all of the income/loss will be in my social should the IRS probe so technically I should report all activity on my tax return. 
I've emailed them to inquire, but I'm sure you know how that goes...
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:35:11
It really just depends on what activities you're invested in. If I was to estimate, based on what I imagine a TurboTax return to look like (no offense, I myself use TurboTax), I would say somewhere in the $200 - $300 range is what your typical firm would charge. When I do sidejobs for people I typically charge $75/hr w/ a 30% discount if you pay in BTC, LTC, or ETH. Firms are going to cost more than a one man show because of overhead, employment taxes, etc.

Not at all - the partnership is set up solely to limit risk at the individual level. There won't be any tax benefit 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:20:36
No, simply holding crypto does not warrant dividend income treatment 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:34:24
I’m interested in this. Wouldn’t you just recognize income on the coin equal to the FMV on the day you had access to it? I understand that not all coins are available immediately after a fork but it’s not taxable until you receive it 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:24:45
I think what he is trying to say is you must have purchased the coins prior to the sale. You cannot use specific identification and allocate cost basis for a sale of coins you did not own as of the date of the sale.

There are no complementary licenses or accreditation’s to pair with the CPA designation. Maybe someday! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:30:24
I’m a CPA as well. I have a few clients who traded all through 2017 but also had some coins on hand at the end of 2017. As long as the appropriate records were there, I used specific identification to lower taxable gains as much as possible. If the records were not credible, I used LIFO.

Is there anyway to purchase on GDAX that's not a bank transfer? I'd like to buy but am fully invested now and did not keep free cash in GDAX :/

Sure. I'll copy and paste an example with a link to an Imgur image. 
This is an excerpt from an actual client of mine from a Coinbase exported CSV file. This is the report most individuals use and is available to all Coinbase users.
For simplicity, lets say client sold .25 Bitcoin 10/31/2017. At this point, if client uses FIFO he must sell his earliest purchased coins and lose the ability to utilize long-term capital gain treatment going forward. He doesn't want to do that.

As long as your claiming no basis I see no reason your method is not acceptable. Short-term capital gains are taxed as the same rates as ordinary income, so whether you recognized income on the FMV and then sold ASAP or simply recognized gain on the amount of funds you received for the coin the effect is the same. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:05:17
I didn’t realize from your initial post you were referencing forked coins being received. Yes, in my opinion you should recognize ordinary income when you received the fork coin equivalent to the fair market value in fiat on the day you received it. Once you recognize income on the coin, this will become your basis. If you sell the coin in the future, you will have a gain or loss event.
