Nah the biggest is people asking a forum of over half a million people watching bitcoin, "hey are you buying bitcoin"
The pope, still catholic right?

All aboard the fail boat. Christ what a pointless post to a sub of 600,000 followers.

Oh for sure I get that they kind of ought to, and you should monitor your account etc. Just wanted to highlight where they dish money out, they soon make it back hand over fist through other channels

More energy and electric is consumed by electrical devices left on "standby" mode. Doesn't make the news though...interesting one...
A couple of the big guys in mining are moving operations to Iceland to take advantage of thermal power and wind power. Fair play to 'em

And you bank also take that money back in the opposite hand they give it you with
-late fees
-using foreign ATMs
-hitting your overdraft and everything else they hit us with
The internet was called useless when that first kicked off. Pretty sure that turned out ok

No more so than all electrical products left on "standby" the world over

One of two things are gonna happen. 
1- you're gonna lose $100. Is it a life changing sum of money? Would it break the bank if it goes to zero? I'm sure the answer is no
2- you've backed the future. You've put faith in something that's going to fly, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not in the next 6months. But imagine it soars, 10x, maybe 20x or more. Surely that $100 makes that a worthwhile shot.
Sit down, buckle up, enjoy!

Not heard a peep about this. Irritating really as the slightest drop in crypto prices is documented to within an inch of its life by the press. All siding with the banks...
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:13:34
I feel your name may have a cryptic message buried deep within it.

Also. Many of the big mining firms are moving operations to Iceland, to take advantage of thermal energy drawn from the volcanos and thermal activity they have there. There's a company just spent 70million getting their rig set up out there. They're not alone

These articles are just crap. More 100's of times more electric is consumed daily by people leaving electric devices on standby mode!
Not only that, it costs more electric to produce the current fiat value of BTC than it does to mine it! i.e it costs more in electric to print and make $14,000 dollars than it does to mine 1BTC. These articles are just another way for people to moan at BTC

"Actively". My old mans pushing 75 and managed no issue at all, through the power of Google. Maybe it's not the tech, but the operator?
