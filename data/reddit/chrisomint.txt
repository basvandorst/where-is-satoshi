This. People need to be educated. It's hard but eventually we'll get it right. 
Bitcoin provides a huge bridge. But it'll take people to actually walk accross it.

I think you guys need to be clearer when you speak of USD or BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:06:15
What exactly is this? What is a trust fund? 
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:28:01

Looks a bit confusing.
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:03:38
Can't you just revert all the transaction going into that cold storage address? 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:12:02

Somebody please do an ELI5 about what China and America is.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:07:33
And I'm guessing in order for that to happen all the hashes for each 'block' has to be recalculated which you would need just as much computing power that went intho them in the first place?
Any idea why it's designed like this instead of ... hmmm the coins being the nodes / blocks themself?
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:07:34
Big hugs bro. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:05:10

And what stops your own country / bank from doing this? 
Nothng...

The UK localbitcoins markup is becoming less and less as the market becomes more saturated. It's currently just 2%! For near instant funding!

Going to check quick... Over here bank transfers are done in less than 5 minutes (UK).

@_date: 2013-11-27 17:24:29
Can somebody please explain in simple ELI5 terms what the fuck this is?
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:25:04
Being a active trader on localbitcoins myself... I can only assume that the BTC seller expected payment within 90 minutes or sooner. If you take longer then this he has all right to expect you to cancel and refund you your payment that was partially or fully sent out.
"After I submitted my online banking payment for $7367.23 AUD, I immediately marked the payment complete. Then I noticed that my bank introduced a new daily limit, giving me an error message that I can only send $5000.00 AUD per day to a third party."
If the bank informed you that the payment went through went actually it didn't then you should take up the issue with them.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:29:35
Apparently it got properly hacked.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:45:34
Hold my friend... Words of wisdom. I bought in at about $1440 due to localbitcoins mark up.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:30:17
Soo just due to chance then?
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:00:16
Correct. It may be a recent innovation though.
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:56:52
No as this exposes a weak passphrase bitcoin address...
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:16:40
Lucky you. After I converted all my entire savings ($65,000) to bitcoin the bank still says I'm 0.5BTC in debt. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:20:53
So basically node = p2p blockchainer. Miner = p2p blockchainer + miner?
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:10:53
Yup anyone who is technology/web orientatetd seems to know about it... But all they seem to want to do is mine these bitcoins... Grr
