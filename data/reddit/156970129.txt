Right? Not designed for payment system? Do these people even remember the title of the damn white paper?? "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" If you can no longer use the currency, it's far from perfect and not what Bitcoin was originally designed for. If that's what you want the project to be now, that's fine, but don't pretend that it's what Satoshi intended

True, it's not literally as bad as having the SAME username AND password across accounts, but it's not the best idea, ESPECIALLY when we're talking about bitcoin. Look at my username. That's basically what your usernames should look like for bitcoin related accounts. No need to make it easier for the bad guys :)

I disagree. You're on a bitcoin subreddit. During a period where - yet again - a bunch of people have just lost a bunch of money due to poor security. People don't need to wear kids gloves when they're explaining *basic* op-sec like DON'T USE THE SAME USERNAME AND PASSWORD. I mean, come on, it's 2016. Do you have an AOL email address? 
AND, anyways, look at the OP response to you. It's perfectly polite, complete with a smiley.

Hey, is this post wingnutty? Yeah, sure. But listen, to try to pretend that bitcoin isn't fundamentally anti-statist is ignoring reality. Bitcoin has alway been pretty out-there, no need to shit on the more anarchist parts of the community.

Go ahead then!

Now there's a few names I haven't heard in a long, long time.
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:21:46
lolol yeah man, either (a) I've only been on reddit for 3 months, or (b) this is one of my many throwaways I cycle through every few months because why the fuck would you only have one account on a poorly maintained website that contains all of your comments, likes and messages. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:15:29
Sorry, definitely don't mean to be hostile. I meant that on earnest. I'd love to see some precedent setting cases here. And that usually takes lots of money. So go ahead! Best of luck!

Woah woah woah. The scaling problem has not been solved, is an ongoing issue, and the folks initially split off from here because talking about their preferred solution to the problem was verboten. You get mercilessly downvoted here if you try to even have the blocksize discussion. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 16:17:26
Meaning absolutely nothing because she has no idea what the fuck she just pledged to do.
@_date: 2016-06-07 00:18:29
Seriously. "Well it's continuing to be used, and grow, and the value is high, but it's not really getting any coverage - bitcoin is dead!"
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:07:56
Frankly, it would be nice to be able to *have* a "debate" here... 
@_date: 2016-12-30 12:09:34
Respectfully, anyone that's telling you "Upside: You'll definitely make a profit" has no idea what they're talking about. Be careful. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:33:31
No. It does not. Jesus christ man just walk it back, you don't have to pick every fucking hill to die on.

One hopes.

I was once at a bitcoin conference where some shithead got in front of the room and said, "If you are a bitcoin business and not an anarchist I don't trust you, because you should never have two masters." 
That was a ridiculous thing to say, and only hurts the community. Take note.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:12:11
Bullshit. Anyone professing to know what is in the tea leaves is lying to you. There is no good reason for the explosion in value over the past month. We're on the same rollercoaster we've always been on. Don't invest more htan you can lose, hodl, etc etc.

I mean, if you lose both your copy and one or both of those banks lose their halves, yes. You would be fucked. 
But nothing is stopping you from making a third copy and leaving it with someone trust or a third bank/whatever.
@_date: 2016-07-21 22:28:42
Obviously this. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 22:53:15
Dude. Take that paper, copy it, put it in a safebox at a reputable bank. Done.
Or: if you're concerned abotu safety/privacy of the bank. Take that piece of paper, cut it in half, put it in two safety boxes at two different banks.
@_date: 2016-07-01 04:33:46
You dumb dumb dummy.

Get bent. This is, and always has been, about the B[TC]enjamins. Mining more than anything else, in fact. These machines are going to aggressively devalue over their lifetime, it's a simple cost/benefits analysis. 


*aggressively makes jerk off motion with hand* Can you get a load of this guy?? Really? Do you know what fucking sub you're in?
