This is an important article. The writer claims to have met Szabo in the flesh at a recent dinner party, gives a physical description of him, and connects more dots about how Szabo is the most likely Satoshi candidate. 
I frankly thought Szabo was an alias behind the alias of Satoshi. But if this New York Times article is to be believed, Szabo is the real person who is most likely to be Satoshi Nakamoto. 
This is a serious, original and well-reported piece. Anyone interested in the Satoshi mystery should read it.

Serious answer: At this point in history "the market" (the aggregate of all demand and supply) values one bitcoin at approx 260 dollars USD. It can be used to buy 260 US dollars worth of good and services.
One btc is more valuable than 0.1 btc because 260 US dollars is more valuable than 26 US dollars. It will buy ten times as much goods and services. 
The degree of bitcoin's divisibility has no relation to the degree of bitcoin's purchasing power.

TOKYO—Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc. has started accepting bitcoin for purchases in the U.S., adding momentum to the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.
Customers using the company’s virtual shopping mall in the U.S. site can already buy items using the Internet-based currency, a Rakuten spokesperson in Japan said Tuesday.
Rakuten executives have previously said the company’s Germany and Austria units will allow payment by bitcoin starting in the second quarter of this year.
Many major U.S. companies have already embraced bitcoin, but Rakuten is one of the first major Japanese companies to accept the virtual currency for payment.
While many Japanese companies agree that bitcoin is a convenient payment method for both customers and merchants because it significantly reduces handling fees, most of them are reluctant to adopt it due to concerns over possible fraud and authorities’ unclear stance on the regulation of bitcoin.
In Japan, Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, collapsed last year and lost customers’ assets worth half a billion dollars, dealing a major blow to the currency’s public image.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party, meanwhile, has decided that the government won’t regulate bitcoin and won’t assign any regulatory bodies to oversee the virtual currency ecosystem. While venture companies welcomed the news, executives at larger companies said the move made it difficult for them to start accepting bitcoin because they want a government agency as a watchdog. Otherwise they would face trouble should unfavorable incidents occur.
Rakuten has been open and passionate about bitcoin’s potential use, hosting several panel talks dedicated to the subject at a recent financial conference hosted by the company. It has also invested in Bitnet Technologies, a bitcoin startup based in San Francisco.
Rakuten’s biggest moneyspinner is its Japanese site, but that isn’t open to bitcoin yet. Rakuten’s chief executive Hiroshi Mikitani said last month he plans to roll out the bitcoin function to the Japanese market as well, although when it would do so is “a trade secret.”"

The style and t-shirt quality are exactly what I want. The QR codes in your example do not scan as actual bitcoin addresses. I want real bitcoin addresses. They don't need to be unique for each shirt (but would be worth double the price, if you could manage that). If you can show me that, I'll send you $50 USD or btc equivalent to get you started.

If I did this to try and "launder" btc bought from coinbase...
* Send btc from coinbase to a paper wallet.
* Send paper wallet btc to cell phone app hot wallet.
* Send cell phone app hot wallet to gambling site.
...would it work?

...without Coinbase knowing.

The purpose is to safely use on gambling site bitcoin originally purchased on coinbase.

Simple, high quality black t shirt. Graphics in white. Square actual qr code and "Public Address" on front. Square actual white QR Code and "Private Key" on back. Both working public and private keys.  Available in XL for me and XS for my little Asian wife. I'd buy at least two. More if the first two arrive looking cool and high quality.
