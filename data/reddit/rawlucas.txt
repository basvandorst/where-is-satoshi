I bought some in Sept. I have 2 kids so I took $500 from each of their savings. My wife and I each put in $500. My dad was interested so he tossed in $500 for a total of $2500. My plan was to add about $100 every month or so. It quickly became apparent that best practice was to not just arbitrarily add money on a set date each month, but rather to hold off your next investment until the dips. 
My original investment was just before the Dimon/China dip so that was when I added the first $100. It was a bit scary at that time, but it was the right thing to do. I’ve added $100 twice since then and I’m sitting on the next $100 for the next dip. 
Summation: Don’t invest everything at once. Have something aside to put in on the dips. Don’t freak out no matter how low the dip goes. Good luck.

Why would Bitcoin dispute the drop? It’s pretty obvious.

I sold about 10% in case it goes down so I have something to buy the next dip with.

Don't sell any. If it dips then toss a bit more cash in and be happy to have bought more at the dip. If it rises then you'll be happy you didn't sell. Recipe for happiness. Win win.
