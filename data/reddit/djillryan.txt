I stopped trying a long time ago. I don't try to convert but I do a quick elevator pitch if I have the time or information pertinent to someone's situation and they seem genuinely interested. I put all my leftover energy I used to spend on preaching Bitcoin  into hodling and acquiring more coin.

Your probably going to have to contact Coinbase and explain. I don't think it will be sent until your client syncs. Personally I love using Bitcoin core as a wallet and a full node when I'm not storing my Btc on it. Next time you use core wait til it syncs and make sure you have at least 8 network connections before you broadcast a transaction.

Lame doge.. At least look at coins that have something new to offer besides a meme. Peercoin has proof of stake, and then there are coins integrating gravity wells to ensure fair mining without multipool abuse. The list goes on and on.

@_date: 2014-01-08 05:08:34
Also the general sentiment seems to be towards making peercoin and other proof of stake coins a better long term holder of value. I also have heard promises of how the peercoin network can handle a greater volume of transactions than bitcoin. This all is a little confusing to me.

Yes but it's a great data set to have available to the public outside of using a full Bitcoin client. Having a spare copy of the blockchain can be valuable to developers. We need people to be able to make apps that make the best use of blockchain technology. Being able to have a jump start standalone copy of the chain is valuable to those who would innovate and refine this technology.

I don't think this is the first time or the last time something like this will happen. I'm getting into proof of stake coins like peercoin for just this reason. You don't have to take my word for it. Do the research for yourself.

I've had missing coins on Coinbase before that took 3 months for them to audit and return to me. I complained to high hell on Reddit and any other forum that would listen to me about my missing money. I was one of those guys. Fact is you are trusting a third party with private keys to your bitcoin if you are using Coinbase to store your coins. They do run a great revolutionary service as a startup and do wonders for the bitcoin economy but they are far from perfect. Don't forget that the bitcoin system is designed so you don't have to use Coinbase to store your coins if you use proper security measures. I'm lucky enough to live in a city with a bitcoin ATM and have become used to using localbitcoins to purchase my coins easier and faster than Coinbase could ever deliver. Long story short, Coinbase is great for merchants wanting to accept bitcoin but as far as buying bitcoin and storing them for personal use I don't touch them anymore. Take care out there in bitcoinland. Better ways are coming :)

I unlocked PoS minting in my wallet client but I'm not exactly sure how I would go about taking advantage of the system as described here.
@_date: 2014-01-08 05:06:10
Hmm not sure, I know the central checkpoints for peercoin are supposed to be going away in version .0.5. They are also going to be implementing the proof of stake so the average user will be able to mint with the qt client and not have to use the command line. From what I understand they haven't had a 51% attack yet even though this coin started out small because the developers wanted to secure the network first and foremost.
@_date: 2014-01-08 04:34:26
Actually from what I understand the peercoin transaction fees are set at .01 and they are destroyed instead of going to the miners causing deflation. Proof of stake would generate .01 per 1 peercoin a year adding a little inflation but not enough to truly call the currency inflationary.

I've used Bitcoin on foodlr for about 2 years now. Works great! I remember when they used the Mt. Gox price back in the day which was always about 10% higher than the other exchanges  prices.

If this is true it might be kind of a big deal. As  far as I know in the past PayPal has not been very friendly to helping people who got scammed selling bitcoins because they didn't know any better. The fact that they took the time to look at the blockchain to verify your claims seems like a big step to me. If this is all true then this is a big step for PayPal and Bitcoin which is eluding to the fact that they are getting ready to incorporate Bitcoin payments via the Braintree platform.
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:31:34
They have an entire virtual currency category. I've seen plenty of listings for small amounts of Bitcoin and altcoins on it before. I never bought any on eBay because I knew better. This is the first time I've heard of PayPal recognizing the authenticity of the blockchains public ledger to handle a dispute like this and award the seller. Might be a milestone in PayPal/Bitcoin history.

@_date: 2013-10-31 08:05:24
Slow down. How much bitcoin did you buy and at what price?
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:03:14
This works both ways. If reddit is not the place for us to seek Coinbase support then people claiming to be Coinbase employees do not need to be on here taunting us with sarcasm @_date: 2013-12-04 07:03:23
@_date: 2013-08-09 10:22:23
Confirmed, waiting 4+ hours for some of my coins to be sent. Still no confirmation on the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:27:07
Unfortunately none of that will get my missing coins back or support to respond. I pray that I will one day be one of the people posting on here about how they were wrong about Coinbase screwing them.
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:57:31
Coinbase: Please respond to my support requests about my missing coins so I don't get labeled as a crybaby on reddit.
@_date: 2013-09-16 02:56:24
Seriously thanks for the tip. Here's a month of reddit gold to show my appreciation. Haters gonna hate.....
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:22:26
I've still been waiting since the 19th for a resolution of what seems to be a bug that took .15 from my account. I'm seeing more and more of a pattern with these problems. I just stopped whining on here because I get nothing but downvotes or accusations of being a noob who doesn't know what 2fa is from Coinbase fanboys. I'm getting sick of this shit and I want my money back. I have bills to freakin pay.
@_date: 2013-08-16 05:45:33
Oh man I'm bear suiting up ASAP. Please just use coinbase like now!
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:05:25
I can speak from experience that careless mistakes do happen to Coinbase users, however I am not one of them. Their support centre seems to have been overwhelmed recently and there are most certainly bugs they are working out. Two words: Cold Storage.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:39:55
I feel like if these posts we are seeing about Coinbase problems are getting out of control and are going largely ignored by a community who seems to love bitcoin so much that they won't admit when things are going wrong. If people were posting above how an actual bank stole thier money I think it would be different.
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:48:40
Yep, i'm not really that concerned with my ROI as much as I am with owning kickass hardware to show off and spread the word of BTC. My strange device with all its blinking chips and fans whirring about that is about to be secured to my living room wall with 3M doublesided tape will be quite the conversation piece.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:39:43
I've been waiting over 5 days past the promised date for the money for some coins I sold. I've never seen customer support for them get this bad before.
@_date: 2013-12-15 11:12:32
Whatever, this guy has an problem. Lots of people have experienced Coinbase bugs. This is still a young startup company. I don't know a single online wallet or exchange that hasn't been compromised at one point. Cold storage people. I'm taking my coins off Coinbase and putting them into cold storage and I'm also taking the time to help each and every one of my friends whose only bitcoin buying and storage has been through Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-08-25 04:46:58
Mostly holding.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:23:15
No actually this just happened a few days ago, except I didn't get any email about a reversal. I just looked at my transaction record and a sell to Coinbase is recorded on November 19th and below it States bought .15 btc for 18.04 paid for by suchandsuchbank myaccountnumber. Your bitcoin will arrive by Aug 28, 2013. I feel like I'm going crazy looking at it.
@_date: 2013-09-08 06:48:36

I would love to have the option to pay rent in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-13 03:29:42
Great Idea! Spread the coin to your family members!
@_date: 2013-11-17 09:48:54
That's super cool
@_date: 2013-08-06 07:28:11
Anddddd what did we learn? Keep your coins backed up offline cold storage style, don't trust any online wallerts, especally onion ones. I'm sorry you felll for this.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:14:56
I win that bet. I'm a 2 factor freak here.
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:10:28
Much appreciated!
@_date: 2013-10-09 04:37:11
That's one if the low serial number ones. They are collectors items and get snatched up fast.

Ooooooh Bobocoins should be the alt
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:58:51
Plus you can clearly see how contradictory it is when it says I sent btc TO Coinbase but the notes in the bottom say I bought back in August. WTF?
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:48:23
God Jesus if you are going to spam at least use a picture of a hot chick or something

@_date: 2013-11-23 19:03:32
I've seen some sarcastic comments on here posted by people claiming to be working for Coinbase support. I appreciate the fact that they are trying but c'mon. This is people's money.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:11:42
I now use coinex to mine and trade whatever altcoin is the most profitable for the day. Today I'm doin bytecoin, a 1:1 bitcoin clone. It's been fun!
@_date: 2013-08-14 11:07:06
These regulators are messing with a hornet's  nest. Their so called regulations have the potential to create an even deeper more powerful black market than the ones that already exist. By the way, the tipping feature on reddit is an awesome way for redditors to learn how to throw around their first bitcoins!!
@_date: 2013-08-09 10:25:14
I've also noticed the "Advanced Details" link showing your the number of confirmations for the transaction doesn't appear for the pending transaction in question. This affirms my suspicions that they are waiting to send it when they have the bitcoin in hand.
@_date: 2013-12-15 11:19:41
I have to help all my friends understand how to do this now. It's annoying thinking about all the work I have to do to explain cold storage to people whose only exposure to buying and storing bitcoins has been through Coinbase. My dumbass recommended Coinbase to them, so now I feel I'm responsible for helping them get their cold storage on. A lot of them just jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon so I've got my work cut out for me. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:44:27
If you hold for an average of 5 to 35 days I'm willing to say you WILL make a profit. Be patient, what we are seeing now is not like the bubble in April.

Totally fine. Just use Bitpay or Coinbase. You can get set up fast and easy.
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:40:45
Same here
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:59:08
Have you had a resolution yet? I'm still waiting....
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:42:07
Yep, this kind of stuff goes on all the time at Coinbase. Count yourself lucky if you've never had a problem with Coinbase. Somebody has to step it up and make bitcoin "Grandma Friendly". Pissing off Grandma doesn't help the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:58:45
No problem. I took advantage of your Bitcoin Black Friday special. Thanks for the extra nostalgia pack with my purchase of the pack of Michael Jackson cards from 1984. I loved how good of a condition the pack was in. Almost like it was bought yesterday. I especially loved the pogs in the nostalgia pack. The Principal Skinner pog was awesome. The Alf stickers and the other assorted goodies in the Nostalgia Pack were also in impressive condition. Best couple bucks of bitcoin I've spent in a while.
@_date: 2013-09-12 04:29:54
I ordered the kit through a group buy with Coinforest.com. These are the kits from bitcoinpaperwallet.com.
He doesn't know anything about bitcoin........yet.
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:49:35
I used to use btcquick to buy with a credit card. Now I use Coinbase. It can be a pain to set up in the first place but once you jump through a few hoops you will be glad you did. Now I have instant access to all the btc I need on a daily basis.

They also credit you with zero confirmations.

Buy Weird Al's catalog with bitcoin. Then you will have my attention.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:51:42
They just reversed a .15 buy I made back in August. I bought them for about 18 bucks then. I have no idea why they would do this. I was really counting on having that btc since I'm currently unemployed. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:14:31
How do we get this to Mr. York's attention?

By the way you don't even need a computer to use bitcoins. You can transact them using a Nokia phone ( The kind you play snake on). Do your research. Hater troll.

Gonna take a couple more years for it to rise enough to stabilize. From what I gather its actually becoming much less volatile as time goes on. Percentage wise the recent crashes are not as bad as the previous ones.
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:29:17
I grow tired 
@_date: 2013-09-15 22:23:37
Totally, if you are just buying and holding bitcoin or investing or whatever more power to you, but the backbone (mining) still needs to happen for everything else to succeed.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:30:01
In complete agreement and tired of waiting to get my coins back. It's truly stunning.
@_date: 2013-09-19 22:25:15
I really wish there was a beef for bitcoin delivery service like this in the USA. Looks good to me.
@_date: 2013-09-16 02:48:22
Wow, with all the unexpected controversy surrounding buying and plugging in some USB miners I could just keep posting pictures of em and cash in my karma for btc lol. Didn't expect people to get so uppity about me spending my money on something I just thought would be cool to own.
@_date: 2013-07-15 05:58:16
@_date: 2013-09-20 03:29:57
Foodler credits you with zero confirmations as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:55:04

@_date: 2013-11-05 23:06:04
Just email support. They are a little backed up right now but trust me you wouldn't believe how much harder it was for the average joe to buy bitcoins a year ago. After all is said and done you will be happy to be the proud owner of your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:06:20
Awesome! I live in Chicago and would love to see your show and pay in bitcoins. I'm one of those people who just love spending bitcoins locally and I wish there were more businesses and performers accepting it. Take care!

Thanks for being a stand up guy; I use Coinbase frequently.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:21:42
I used to say the say thing and I thought all these Coinbase posts were from irresponsible noobs. Then a bug in thier system withdrew some btc from my account that I was counting on using to pay a bill this month. I'm still waiting on support to get back to me. I just have to remind myself that Coinbase has been around less than a year. These things are bound to happen. I really hope I get my coin back.

Try lower denominations for a wider audience.

Also let me know if you have any server positions available at whatever restaurant you work at. If you are accepting bitcoins there too I would love to be involved in a business like that.
@_date: 2013-09-23 19:01:25
Thanks for the link. I think too many people watch Fox News for their information and this is a good way to get my Bill O'Reilly watching parents to understand it better.

Yeah just like email. Stupid trend that was.
@_date: 2013-08-23 05:20:21

@_date: 2013-11-22 09:49:53
Yeah, I've gotten my ACH transfers after long delays and emailing support. Unfortunately I've moved on to the problem of my account missing money for no good reason. I really hope Coinbase gets caught up.

@_date: 2013-09-05 21:17:05
No but I plan on ordering more from them during the holidays. Christmas is right around the corner :). I'm excited to see how the holiday season this year affects the bitcoin economy with all these new merchants accepting btc. I'm trying to discipline myself and hold most of the btc I get my hands on til December. 
@_date: 2013-08-06 07:33:20
I'm checking it out. Would love to hear someones feedback.
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:58:12
So far I have 8 Asicminer USB's running and 4 more on the way from btcguild. Aside from groupbuys on bitcointalk forums, they really do have the best pricing out there. I like how they add coupon discounts and tiered pricing according to your previous buys. Right now I have 46 coupons left for eruptors for .15 each and only .05 for shipping of the whole lot. 
I really do enjoy doing my part to secure the blockchain :)
Freedom isn't free ya'll.
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:01:23
Also yes, I use two factor. My coins simply went missing and I can still see the account transaction that says they were sold to Coinbase. This wasn't a cancellation or a reversal. It was obviously some kind of bug and the lack of support or resolution alarms me enough to no longer recommend them to friends.
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:00:32
You sir are an Asshole. If anything all you did what piss off a server and turn someone off of bitcoin. Boo this man.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:04:32
They have a lot if bugs to work out. They mysteriously withdrew .15 btc from my account yesterday with no explanation. I have 2 factor and everything. Still waiting on customer support to get back to me.
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:24:00
These guys' creations are out of this world. Namely the OP-1 sampling synth. I've been saving my coin to get one. Whether they take btc by the time I save up enough is anybody's guess, but a guy can dream......
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:54:20
Same here!
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:56:36
I never use any online sort of web wallets without 2-factor authentication. I also never store that much wealth online. Cold storage should have been used here of course.

That's awesome. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:34:30

These guys are looking to tackle the remittance market with their open source trading platform. Very high potential to open up exchanges all over the globe. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:02:22
First off, prepare for downvotes. Second, I'm sorry for your loss. Third, I'm also waiting for support to get back to me about coins that went missing. Good luck I'm right there with you!

Btcquick should have a Paypal option, zipmark bank deposit option, or company check option up and running soon. I can't wait to see how it works once they implement it in thier site.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:39:32
 I just bought 2 dollars worth to test it out. Happy to see the minimum go down.

Yeah that's the best kind lol
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:49:59
I've also had some Coinbase shenanigans. Waiting on support to get back to me via email. Fingers crossed.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:22:09
Same 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:44:43
And yes it still seems that buying bitcoin has a long way to go before its not considered risky.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:55:35
I've still been waiting a month for support to get back to me about missing coins. I received only one email saying "We've detected a potential error in your balance history, and your account has been flagged for a manual review. You can greatly assist us by clarifying whether there have been:
1) Any recent bitcoin transfers that have been removed from your balance without authorization
2) Any recent charges from us that appeared without authorization
3) Any previous payment reversals in your account history where bitcoins were purchased but not successfully paid for. 
Your ability to provide accurate and concise information will greatly help us to clear this up quickly. Thank you for your patience as we look into this!
-Rees D. Sloan" 
Still Haven't received any word since this email a month ago and my coins are still missing. I really hope they figure it out. My advice would be to transfer your coins off of Coinbase and into cold storage just to be safe.

This also happened to me. I'm missing .15 btc that they reversed from a buy back in August. The reversal occurred on Nov 19, I am very frustrated and waiting on support. Posting on here about it has mostly gotten downvotes and accusations. It's sad really.

I just ordered the assorted bag of honey caramels from these guys a few days ago. I paid for them very quickly with bitcoin. Within the hour they had sent me an email with tracking number saying that the caramels they had made that night would be shipping out to me the next day at noon. Very prompt and personalized response! I'm about to buy some more honey now with a few extra coins I have laying around from my weekends mining output. I'm super excited for these guys!
@_date: 2013-09-16 04:57:25
I bought my first one on Amazon before I smartened up. I get better deals from BTC guild and I like their convenience of service plus coupon tiers. You could probably get a much better deal on a groupbuy from someone like silentsonicboom on bitcointalk forums. I paid about 40 bucks for my first one on amazon lol. I got the latest ones for .15 btc each.

@_date: 2013-09-12 05:26:27
From my experience it's fairly easy to sweep a paper wallet on blockchain.info, I'm not sure how secure coinbase's wallet importing feature is but I've used it succesfully once. I haven't used inputs.io yet. Of course I gotta show him how to use a program like multibit to give him the proper rundown.

I put the majority of my money in bitcoin holdings. I find if I wait an average of 5 to 30 days at some point my bitcoin is worth more than I bought it for. I use foodler for food delivery and I mostly shop at Wal mart using gyft.

I don't know what's up with them. Logged on today to find I'm missing .15 btc. Not a good day for me or Coinbase.

I've hated banks ever since the real estate bubble. My mother is very old and lost a lot of money making some rash decisions selling her house a moving a few times after my father passed away. She never had any experience making big financial decisions until then and I was too young at the time to understand what was going on in the market. I know not a lot of people like alt-coins but I see potential in them for the future. Bitcoin is great for a long term storage of value with its deflationary system but I think in the future some of the alt-coins with their built in inflation will be good for day to day spending and lending. People still want a currency they can lend and borrow with.

A lot of people still think getting bitcoins in general is a lot of work and rarely put any time or effort into it. I find the average person still believes its hard to aquire them.

True true. I guess it's not so much of a hassle as it is a lot of folks not having much faith in new companies popping up with awesome pre order deals after the butterfly labs fiasco. Personally I'm scared of preordering with anyone now. Maybe if they said something on thier websites like "We promise to do the very best we can not to pull a BFL." I would feel more comfortable.

This makes me so mad hearing this. People act like "oh I had that problem but Coinbase support got back to me now its okay."
Cold storage all the way. Their support is nearly non existent at at Coinbase due to the massive influx of noobs jumping on the bandwagon. It's a meat market for people trying to steal coins. A centralized point of failure. Fuck the Coinbase fanboys.

I've never had any problems. I mostly use a prepaid card with a checking account though. I don't trust big bank branches. I know the prepaid card I use to get my funds is probably owned by a big bank but I've never had any problems. I never had a problem doing ACH transfers between my account and Coinbase.

I'm spare you from reading all the posts about never receiving an ROI and just say have fun!

I'm assuming OnionWallet is a hidden service that you can keep a bitcoin wallet on?
