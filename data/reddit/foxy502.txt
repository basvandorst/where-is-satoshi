What is meant by this, as a genuine question what would be the regular procedure of buying bitcoin with fiat x, and then selling that into new fiat y? I would think for the average buyer this would cost a similar amount to the bank, and also take longer depending on the limits set?

 Could be a new method of measurement for satoshis?

I agree, the whole idea is annonymity but access is so difficult! Coinbase is making it difficult for utilisation because of fees and delays. It is cheaper to use a regular swift payment through the bank than crypto. In about 5 years crypto could be amazing, but by that time swift will likely of upgraded it's systems to counter this behaviour?

I made the above statistic up to prove a point!

Based on which demographic!? 80% of people know statistics can't be trusted.

Dude! The charts arent important! It's bitcoin, last time bitcoin jumped an empty packet of crisps nearly hit me on the knee... That was bitcoin! I've never had a bar of gold hit me on the knee, gold is miles behind bitcoin!

I think a better idea would be "in 2019" start using crypto to make payments, open "name of crypto" accounts for friends, family, neighbours, great uncle Jim and send them allowences, debts or purchases with crypto. Talk to them about utilisation, and let the price rise because of utilisation. Holding is only effective once utilisation becomes a reality
