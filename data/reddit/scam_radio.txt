This. I know I can buy fractions of a coin but there's just something more satisfying about purchasing a single coin.

Yeah I know, I just want to. But this thread finally motivated me and I just bought .02 btc.

I have Hive wallet installed on my Mac, but the majority of my btc is on Coinbase. I was going to transfer it all to my local wallet, but one time when I opened up Hive, it said that Java needed to be updated. I did the update and it worked but it got me thinking that maybe using a wallet that requires another 3rd party application to work isn't the best idea either. Can you recommend a better wallet or should I just not worry about that?

Except you know they'll spin it as "Bitcoin funds terrorism. Vote for (insert retarded politician here) to ban Bitcoin and end terrorism"

Haha whoops. I'll just leave it to show my shame.
