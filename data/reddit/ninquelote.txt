So that means I shouldn't save the public key on an exchange and just use the one that my Ledger give me when I'm transferring my BTC?

Tbh, it didn’t trigger me. It made me laugh because this is pathetic.
Who the fuck are you to give financial advices and act as if you knew better?
You don’t know shit. Everybody here don’t know shit about where this is going. A lot of us are in for the technology rather than getting rich quicky. We are here for the financial revolution. Yes, it may fail... or not.
Like I said, you gave your opinion, bravo. Now gtfo with your FUD. You don’t belong here.

Thankfully you’re not as dumb as all of us. 
Now that you gave us your opinion, you can gtfo. Kthxbye.

He asked you a question.
Now, answer it without telling him he is brainwashed or calling him. He just asked a question. So either you behave yourself and answer like a grow-up or you get the fuck out of here.

Sounds like B2X might not be dead yet as some people claimed when F2Pool backed down from NYA..
