Oh, so even though a transaction can be split over many UTXOs, if I query that address I will be able to get the right balance.
Do you know the most efficient way to do this for the history of an address, like say one that was created in 2013?
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:13:23
You can, but why risk the IRS coming for you? The blockchain is public and so if anytime in the future they find a way to link your identity to an address, they can see if you paid your taxes for that year.

I am making an app too, made a youtube video on the beta, check my posts.
Heres some advice, some may have already been mentioned:
- Change the title. Next time, you need to sell it like your mother's life depended it, without lying ofcourse.
- Don't make it open-source. If people are really skeptic, hit me up and I will run a network sniffer, to see if you do anything suspicious with the app. As soon as you make this open source, there will be 10 different versions of your app, with a different background colour and maybe a random number after the original name.
- It was a good idea to release it as a beta, so people know what they are getting themselves into, when you monetize, the beta would have been like the free trial.
- On monetisation, I think you should not put in any ads, one problem I had with my app was putting in ads, it completely ruined my interface and I removed it.
- A good monetisation idea, would be to limit the amount of Exchanges to something like 10. Or if you are stubborn on ads, put in custom ads that you can control. I'm sure you can find some sponsors.
Good luck and well one on the app!

haha I'm so happy for your feedback. Literally makes me smile, haha.
I do notice that the part where it calculates the taxes, takes around 30seconds to a minute for transactions in the 1k+ region. I would like it to be faster, as I believe people do not want to wait that long?
Thanks again jmw74 for watching and giving feedback!

Thanks man, if you have any ideas about features, then don't be afraid to say
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:11:55
Alright thanks very much i_gotta_say !
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:05:12
I agree, with enough pressure the exchanges will give over the information requested. I believe the John Doe summons was just the start.
If I had knowledge of all of your addresses, I would be able to calculate how much tax you owe, by checking the timestamp in the blockchain of when you bought and the timestamp of when you sold.

If you would like to get involved, contact me, email in video description
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:57:48
Ahh I understand what you mean. I was assuming that once they deposited into the exchange, they would immediately move the funds to an independent account.
yes, you are right because buying/selling on an exchange happen off chain.
With this, I will try to get as many exchanges on to the app as possible. I initially did not do it for the first release because there are so many and it clutters the ui. 
Thanks for the conversation jmw74 :)

I said if anytime in the future, they find a way to link your identity to an address.
The blockchain in a sense has perfect secrecy, however if they were to find some sort of external information that could link you to your owned addresses. They would just need to check the blockchain to calculate your taxes.

Currently we are launching on iOS in a week, within this timeframe we are able to add one more feature. I will post again, when it is released, gamerguy51 :)
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:54:26
and no other coin uses this format?
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:57:43
can I also ask:
If I check the blockchain with my bitcoin address for all transactions, will it have my address for at least one of the inputs on each outgoing transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:22:08
I am not sure I said it was jmw74.
If I have when you deposited at an exchange, and all of your addresses, I can then figure out how much profit you have earned by looking at the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:42:15
yes exactly, so I imagine it would work by generating a database of 1million addresses and the one that closely matches the first/last three letters for example would be used.
At this moment in time, it's a bit of a mystery and I hope that people come message me back, so that I can create a suitable solution.
It could even be a regex lookup. My one fear right now is that someone will invest a lot of money into crypto, and when they go to withdraw it, they find out that they have been robbed. 
I urge anyone reading this to get into contact with me, try to also give info on what website you were on when this happened. We have only had mentions of sourceforge at the moment.
Thanks javaxnerd for the comment, if the malware has evolved that far and in the background submits the attackers address, then I think the API solution will work, it will just have to be implemented by wallet developers in a different way, so for example, if they spot a fraudulent address, they would ask the user to double check that they would like to send to this address.
Thanks again

I respect your opinion and I do agree that someone could try to add a merchant into the database if they thought they were done wrong. For this, we would keep track of official database addresses.
I believe you do have a point and the service I am trying to offer will not be for everybody and will have it's downfalls, like you have mentioned. 
Where we differ is that I do not want more situations where we have companies like BitConnect having so much influence over so many people, and scammers feeling like they can do whatever they want to the unsuspecting in turn damaging the reputation of cryptocurrency.
Maybe you are right, in that a tool like this will become obsolete once we have more privacy and anonymity, for now I would like to help as many people as I can with coinjudge.
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:00:58
Not yet. If you open up a new post and give your reasons as to why you think it is a scam or a legitimate coin, then a decision can be made.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:27:43
Thanks for the feedback Bitcoin-Yoda.
I believe that we are not breaking any of the stated principles of bitcoin "Permissionless and fungible" Scammers are free to replace their addresses with as many as they want. I just want them to know that there is a system in place that will slow down their operations or in some cases deter it.
For example,
If John a hacker somehow got money off of Person A from some advertisement. Person A then adds his address into the database.
Now lets say you see the same advertisement, would you not want some system to deter you from parting with your precious Bitcoins?
I welcome your feedback and discussion, coinjudge stands to be a firewall between scammers and your pocket.

I would suggest transferring it to a cold wallet. So you keep ownership of them. When you do plan to sell, you can transfer it to an exchange that allows credit card withdrawals and that would be it.
