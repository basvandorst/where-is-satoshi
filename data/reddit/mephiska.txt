You assume that all people are naturally peaceful.   Unfortunately we know from history that this is not human nature.
So please, if you have a better alternative to normal government and that allows for "life, liberty and property" that involves no taxation whatsoever that pays for the administration of "life, liberty and property", please let us know.  You will probably win the Nobel prize.

Their stock market couldn't operate if every transaction was taxed based on gross proceeds.   The OP must know his cost basis and report it to get those taxes refunded.
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:30:29
Yes, and the capital gains is on the **gains** part of the transaction, not proceeds.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:48:31


They probably determined this from the fact that this guy suddenly got a transfer of 6300 euro with NO INCOME ACCOUNTING WHATSOEVER.  
No costs reported to the government, no tax forms accounting for this income.
They are completely within their right to tax this incoming transfer.
OP MUST account for this income somehow.  He must report his cost, what he paid for those 14.6 BTC that he sold, and he should absolutely pay taxes on his capital gains.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:37:13
So you document and report your cost basis of what you sold and get a refund.   Buying &amp; selling BTC will likely be treated no differently from any other security or commodity, and people need to realize this.

"Access to this security is restricted by it's supplier"....
Guess they want to be paid before they let you look at it.

Alienware laptops are very well constructed.  I had an M11x and was very impressed with the quality for the price.  Solidly built, great features, and it served me well for the four years I owned it.  It held its value relatively well too as I sold it on eBay for 1/3rd of what I paid for it.

Apparently this guy from Greece is not tax compliant and is suddenly surprised when his government does something competent.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:55:54


There's your problem right there.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:31:29
yeah, all those government workers doing things like ensuring roads are maintained, schools are administered, police are operating, etc.  Sure there is government waste, but let's not just demonize government as a whole here. 
and "welfare transfers"... sure, let's go ahead and write off all the poor as well, even if they're not "deserving" in your eyes. 
This subreddit is filled with anti-tax libertarians who benefit from a regulated society but wish to pay for none of it.  The Bitcoin community needs to fight this element because it will only detract from Bitcoin, not help it.  Just look at all these tax avoidance posts, "government is stealing our money!", more of us need to speak up against this sentiment.
@_date: 2014-06-24 00:27:01
So what?  He should get it back at the end of the year when he files taxes, so long as he reports his cost correctly.  And if he mined it and didn't track his cost, then he is **absolutely responsible for paying those taxes**.  This is exactly why Greece is in such financial trouble, lax reporting and too many citizens don't pay their required taxes.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:57:07
No it's just an index right now.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:38:34
Document and report your cost basis of what you sold and get a refund when taxes are filed, or report your cost basis to the bank and have them adjust the taxed amount. Buying &amp; selling BTC will likely be treated no differently from any other security or commodity, and people need to realize this.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:28:58
This is correct.  The Armory 0.90 beta client does work with the new 64 bit Bitcoin-qt 0.90 as long as you point to the \daemon folder.

Make sure you keep your receipts.  Eventually companies like Coinbase may be required to report large transactions, which could put you on the radar with the IRS for an audit, and they will want to know where the income from coinbase came from.  Any wire transfer or ACH over $10,000 is reported for anti-money laundering anyway.
For your own good, If you buy bitcoins with currency, keep track of the date &amp; price paid, just like if you bought &amp; sold stock or gold.  If you mine or have been mining for a while, then hang on to electricity bills and receipts for hardware and prepare to use them as business expenses.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:55:29
There is also real currency in many of those accounts.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:38:01
because tax avoidance is what all the cool kids do!   
OP hasn't provided any evidence that this tax rate is out of line.  We don't know what he paid for these 14.6 BTC, or if he mined them himself early on.  
The whole reason Greece is having trouble with debt is their country has a pattern and culture of tax avoidance and underpayment, and this post only perpetuates that.  How can you blame the Greek government for implementing measures to tax all foreign transfers into the country at the default rate unless the source of this income/transfer is properly reported and accounted for?
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:25:42
OP should have instructed customers not to send funds as "gift" and refunded the transaction.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:44:57
Coinbase must still be compliant with AML reporting regulations, and any transactions over 10k must be reported.  Any other regular transactions can be reported to the IRS upon request as well, so if you do things that "look" like they are intended to avoid taxes, it may get reported and you may bet audited by the IRS.
TLDR: If you mine or speculate in BTC, account for things as if it were a physical asset like Gold, and pay for your taxable gains accordingly, after costs for mining hardware, etc.
@_date: 2014-09-05 19:58:04
Yes, it is exactly this.  AML rules state that any transfer over $10,000 be subject to extra scrutiny for compliance reasons.  This is in no way Coinbase's fault, they are just operating within the laws of the land.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:40:55
If OP accounts for the source of his Bitcoin and the cost of acquiring them, then he can report them in his tax reporting, then this tax withholding should be 100% reimbursed.
Until that happens from OP, this tax withholding by his bank is 100% justified.  Greece is notorious for having taxpayers who underpay, and if this is how their government is going after tax dodgers, then more power to them.

So no longer an issue, why bring it up?  afaik they haven't done this for at least 8 years as my office buys almost exclusively Dell desktops and none of them have proprietary connectors, and I've replaced a few PSUs out of warranty.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:49:09


Well have you done anything to inform the government of what you paid to obtain that 14.6 BTC?  You should be able to write that off against the value of the proceeds of your sale, and whatever profit remains would be taxable.
There's this sense that Bitcoin is magical tax-free internet money, and as we fight for legitimacy and acceptance, we should not be surprised when government starts to pay attention.
From the government's point of view you received around 6300 euro via a bank transfer with no source for those funds.  They see it as income, and it's up to YOU to keep track of your costs for tax reporting purposes if you don't want them to just take 22% off the top.
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:15:06
How much did you originally pay for those 14.6 BTC that you sold?
@_date: 2014-06-24 03:43:30
Your argument is predicated on the assumption all in the government are evil, and government itself is evil by nature.
You're right, let's abolish all rule by law and live by anarchy.  You provide no alternative, only wish to bash the status quo.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:07:35
Well, except if it's reported on before the authorities can freeze their assets it gives these guys advance notice and time to try and move the money/shred documents/run and hide.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:35:14
I don't get it, you said your monthly electrical bill is $1300/mo and your miners yield $5-10/day, at most that's $300/mo.   That's the opposite of profitable.
