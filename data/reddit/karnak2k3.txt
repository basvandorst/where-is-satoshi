The more savvy you are, the more options you have available to you, but it is hard to recommend the more stringent practices to the typical user. For example, using something like NoScript(or any browser's equivalent addon) that blocks JavaScript on a per-domain basis is NOT a practical solution for most people.
However, there are some good places to start. First, use an ad blocker. It is not good for internet business, but there are so many unsafe, intrusive, and even malicious advertising platforms out there, that this step alone prevents many opportunities for the user to do something bad just by browsing.
Second, if you aren't savvy enough to use NoScript, you have to get in the habit of not going to shady websites altogether. Places that stream TV or movies(or give you anything, pirated or otherwise) for free, for example, are likely to be running shady ad services or are using other tricks to leverage your visit for their profit. They have to get paid for their hosting somehow.
Don't trust links or attachments in messages or email. Ever. The last bit of general safety advice is that when you do need to download a program or game, only do so from the primary source(those who made the product) or from a trusted third party vendor like Amazon, Steam, Origin, et al. Research things before committing to running them on your computer.
This isn't a catchall for perfect security. There is no such thing, but this is a good place to start for habits. You can't trust any security program to keep you safe. It is all on the user's shoulders.
