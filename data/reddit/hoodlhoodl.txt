it does not work like that. If they only knew how to predict prices they would not have to open a company and run business.
They will be off to Mars a while ago.


In that case they would be out of business after first major down trend.

Life changing amount is ~1m$
One blowjob is 20$, that is 50'000 blowjobs.
If you are 20 and going to have 3 BJs a day that will last you until you are 70 years old.
I'd be careful of that many blowjobs though.

It does not determine price of transaction.
It determines price of transaction 
AND 
price of keeping peoples coins secure, fungible and movable 
AND 
price of more or less fairly air-dropping coins onto the population of earth.
Why would you say that all of that price should be counted towards transaction cost is beyond me.
Blocks do transactions and they cost money. But they do a lot of other things too!

Why you put .000 three zeroes after dot?
