Can someone explain to me how this happened? I remember when it only cost a few cents to send any amount.

Even if this was done before bitcoin was classified as anything?

That’s what I was afraid of... I could see this newfound power for ISPs to censor content being sold to the highest bidders. If central banks so desired, they could make it profitable for ISPs to throttle or block bitcoin content.

Just tell them you traded it all for Doge a few years back and start proselytizing about it, that should kill any interest they have.

Doesn't the protocol allow for the use of "Micro Transactions" that aren't as constrained by transaction fees? I could be totally wrong, but I swear I read about this somewhere. Once the coins have all been mined, I could see a new fee system being appropriate. To my knowledge the current state of transaction processing makes this a tough problem because small transactions are just as hard to hash as large ones, so you need a standardized fee otherwise miners would abandon smaller transactions. 
Perhaps a more efficient sidechain can be made with the aim of bundling a higher number of small transactions per block while decreasing the difficulty to make up for the lower transaction fees. You could scale the difficulty so that both chains are equally profitable for miners. So you have the original blockchain that deals in say ≥ B⃦0.1 and then you have another chain that deals with ≤ B⃦0.1. In this way the market cap would simply be the sum of the two blockchains. Transactions over B⃦0.1 would use one fee and transactions under B⃦0.1 would implement a lower one, but make up for it with decreased difficulty and higher number of transactions per block (assuming there will be far more micro transactions than large ones). This could also help solve the issue of increasing block size in terms of bundled transactions since a lot of blocks are bloated with micro transactions and "bot" transactions.

Contrary to common belief, you don't have to give any personal information to use many bitcoin exchanges. If you are willing to wait two days for a money order to go through the mail then there's no problem.

It wouldn't necessarily "help" the network in terms of infrastructure. It would, however, serve to increase the relative value or "spot price". When you take a portion of the coins you receive out of circulation, you increase the value of the coins that are still circulating. The more people that save their coins for a rainy day, the more each traded coin is worth on an open exchange. Value isn't dictated by market cap, but by the number of coins available for trade.
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:52:47
Remember though, more miners doesn't necessarily mean an increase in price. It means a decrease in confirmation time, which is great for the network. So far only three things appear to be a surefire boon for price increase and those are 1) Huge speculative buying rush 2) People saving their coins as a store of value and 3) People spending their coins within the BTC network and those coins staying in the network [so buying a product from a store in BTC which turns around and restocks the item using that BTC], this also increases the utility of the coin as a store of value.  is probably the biggest driver of price. Remember, market cap doesn't indicate price, although it does indicate health and depth. When it comes to price it is all about supply, demand, and scarcity.

No no no, each planet would have their own crystallized xanthanite blockchain syncing apparatuses. By transmitting electrons across dimensions using the theory of electron tunneling the blockchain will update from every civilization in the multiverse instantly.

Yeah I was thinking about how I could see this on my desk. Stable and nicely visible. I think the touchscreen was a good choice. I too have an unused touchscreen in my random-pi-parts box. I'm finishing up a Temperature/Humidity logger project for work and am trying to figure out my next one. I'm thinking either a portable retropi or something like this.

Wait... someone wants zero confirmation payments? That sounds like a terrible idea.

Well that's inconvenient... that seems like they would be selling to a distributor of some sort. Maybe you could get one from whoever orders that many? I would love to get one. I would definitely use it during international travel.

So it is tracked and kept accurate by an internal banking authority? I'm curious though, what would stop a loop from forming in which fractionally lended funds are credited to an entity who then places those funds into his account, then the bank uses those funds to further lend fractionally? How could they tell? Also, is there an authority that keeps transnational transfers from interfering with the money supply? As in funds move out of the country, are then fractionally loaned out (making, say, 5x the original amount), and are then moved back into the country. It just seems easy to exploit to me, but I might be wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:11:29
Yes! The best example of this is every time you swipe a credit card. Thanks to the lax laws on fractional reserve lending, banks can lend out ten times the amount of money they actually have in reserves. So, when you swipe your card and increase your loan balance by, say, $9.00. The bank really only has $.90 (at best, no one really audits them over the 10:1 rule), but they just type into a computer that they lended you $9.00 and the ball keeps rolling. So in reality, they just wrote into their database that they have $8.10 more than they actually had. Unfortunately it is just the way things are :(

It may very well be made up, but on its face it doesn't raise any red flags. I'm sure there were graduate programs in Quantum Chemistry back in the 80s when the term was in use. Nowadays it is more likely to be called Theoretical Chemistry or Computational Chemistry. Even still, you can get a PhD at the University of Southampton in England with a focus on Quantum Chemistry and they actually use that term.
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:18:46
Quantum Organic Chemistry is a bit of an outdated term, but is an area of study nonetheless. It aims to quantitatively predict the outcome of Organic reactions using basic physical laws. QOC has largely been replaced with "Computational Organic Chemistry", but it is indeed a true area of study.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:50:51
I'm not going to look all over for more examples because the term has fallen out of favor and most programs have a different name, but suffice it to say that there is at least one university offering studies in quantum chemistry even in the past few years.

So will this create two "pools" of btc? Or will coins be able to go from fungible to non-fungible? Honestly I thought bitcoin was fungible as-is. I've exchanged it for many currencies. Are you sure this isn't just making it bank friendly? Because challenging the current structure of finance was kind of the point...

The Market Cap is also a good indicator of this. A little less specific (doesn't necessarily indicate new users the way hard wallet sales does) but pretty informative nonetheless. [Fiat Leak]( is a fun visualization.

I think it is important to look at the momentum behind this recent climb. The depth of price compared to our last ramp up is far more reassuring. People were surprised in April.... It feels as if this burst is fully warranted, if not expected.
