Thank you for your kind words!
Muun is a non-custodial and very user friendly wallet. This was the main reason why it was the perfect wallet for the trial. Also, it has both the UI and support in spanish (and in english)

Yes, I actually meant a skype/zoom/hangout/etc call. My native language is spanish and when we say "call" (in english) we never mean a "phone call". In any case, it was my bad not to double check this and make sure it couldn't be misunderstood.

A small comment on this. By "particular good transaction" I meant an experience you enjoyed when paying in Lightning. People usually mention "this transaction was super fast, it took 2 seconds", "this was cool because it was in a physical merchant", "I liked this because I use lnurl so didn't have to scan an invoice". I was trying to get that kind of answers, nothing personal or sensitive information

This was one important reason for choosing a slum in Buenos Aires rather than other places in Argentina. It wasn't a big issue during the experiment, but we took some precautions such as asking the android version beforehand. There was only one guy who couldn't participate because he had a very old smartphone and one person who couldn't finalize a purchase because of poor internet connectivity.

Hi! I'm Florencia, I work at Muun doing Operations and writing a blog ([blog.muun.com](
I'm currently doing some research on Lightning. I'm genuinely trying to talk with Lightning users to see how they think about Lightning, what problems they encountered and what could be improved. I tried to be careful about how I reach out to people in the space (well aware there are tons of scams), but it seems I could have done a better job. Sorry if this frightened you, I \*really\* didn't mean to.
Talking to people has been very helpful to understand where we should focus and what topics I should write about. I never meant a phone call (actually I'm in Argentina, so it wouldn't have made sense to me). In spanish we usually refer to a skype/zoom call simply as "call". I'll make sure I clarify this next time.
Also, please let me know if there's anything I could change in the way I communicate so that this doesn't happen again.

Regaining access by clicking on an email and entering a password is much more familiar to many people than entering a seed phrase. Also, this prevents people from having to keep a piece of paper that, if lost or found by the wrong person, can end up in the user losing all their funds.
Thanks for asking this and sharing your concerns. We are exploring different ways to allow more expert users to create a wallet without needing to provide an email.
@_date: 2019-10-14 23:13:26
We ask for an email to provide an easy way to regain access to your wallet if you change your phone or log out. It is used as a security factor during the process of recovery.
By the way, you are welcome to use an anonymous email, like protonmail, as long as you have access to it.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:34:59
That's the reason why we have the code open for public auditing.

We are happy to share, it was very insightful for us too!
This first trial was partly funded by Givecrypto [  and partly funded by Muun Wallet.
Givecrypto provided the funds for the donations and we took care of the operational costs. Just to mention some: we had to hire someone to help us enter the neighborhood safely and get in touch with the people, we translated the app into Spanish and provided support for people with old phones, poor internet connectivity and very little tech knowledge. 
We will need more funds for a second, larger experiment (100-1000 people). We are still figuring out how to get them and asking for help in the Bitcoin community is definitely an option :)
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:53:06
No, this is how it works: we store an encrypted backup of your private key that you can use to login if you change your phone or logout. The backup is encrypted with a password you choose at the moment of wallet creation. We don't store a copy of this password, so we cannot decrypt the backup.
When you want to regain access to your wallet, you go through a 2FA process: first, you click on an email we send you (proving you have access to your email account) and then you enter your password. The key is cryptographically rebuilt in your phone, and stored in the secure enclave.
Of course, you can also export your keys to sweep funds all by yourself without Muun's collaboration. There's an open source recovery tool that helps you do this: [

Thanks for sharing your thoughts about this. We are currently looking for alternatives for more experienced users who might not find value in having this recovery and prefer not to provide an email address.

I'm curious about the use you'd give to a lightning wallet currently. Would it be to mostly \*send money\* to pay off-chain invoices or would you rather be able to generate off-chain invoice and \*get paid\* over lightning? Or both equally?
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:35:30
Excellent point and 100% agreed! Fees weren't a big deal in the trial but just because money was donated to people. 
Our development team is focused on implementing Lightning Network in our mobile wallet. We also have a research team focused on solving some open problems. You can see part of their work in [
You can expect to see some Lightning features very soon ⚡

I see. So for this case we took 2 decisions that resulted very helpful in that sense.
Firstly, we chose a slum in Buenos Aires, rather than other provinces in Argentina, since not only smartphone penetration is higher, but also smartphones are newer and internet connection is better. 
Secondly, within the slum, we chose people who weren't in what we call "emergency groups", that is people who need more essential help and wouldn't be able or open to learn a new technology.
@_date: 2019-02-07 19:01:55
Thank you! 
Bitcoin is still very useful for fully banked people in Latin America! I am from Argentina (the entire Muun team is from here) and we have inflation and corrupted banks and governments. Bank accounts aren't the solution , because the problem is in the currency and in the government.
As a matter of fact, most of the team first heard of Bitcoin when getting paid as a remote developer was super hard (back in 2013/2014) because of strong controls on foreign currencies.
I’m not sure to fully understand your question. Could you please develop a bit further? What industries are you thinking of?
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:21:47
Thanks! 
In Muun, you have one hot personal key that’s really easy to access but it’s not enough to move funds. This allows Muun to introduce the fraud protection you mentioned. A second key, the co-signing key, is also stored in your phone but heavily encrypted (password+cold recovery code). You can *uncomfortably* access this second key and both, together, are enough to move funds. This is the only way to "skip" the fraud protection and the reason why your funds cannot be frozen.
On a daily basis you are not required to use the co-signing key, since this would compromise on the usability of the wallet. Instead, the server provides the co-signing key. Notice that the server only holds one of the keys so nobody, but you, can spend your money.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:20:33
Yes, we are exploring different ways this could be better for advanced users who prefer a seed. You can expect to see improvements on this. 
\&gt; It implies that you are holding a copy of the seed phrase or private keys yourselves, which essentially makes you custodial, right?
No, we don't hold a copy of the seed phrase or private key. We are a non-custodial wallet.
Here's how it works: we store an **encrypted** backup of your private key that you can use to login if you change your phone or logout. The backup is encrypted with a password you choose at the moment of wallet creation. We don't store a copy of this password, so we cannot decrypt the backup.
When you want to regain access to your wallet, you go through a 2FA process: first, you click on an email we send you (proving you have access to your email account) and then you enter your password. The key is cryptographically rebuilt in your phone, and stored in the secure enclave.

Thanks for explaining your concern in detailed.
The seed creation is random (doesn't not use you email or password) and the password is only used to create an encrypted backup for the seed. You can check this on our public repo: [

Interesting! Do you mean topping up a channel you have with the exchange or a channel you have with some other node?

We are exploring different options around spending levels. It's pretty simple for now, will get more sophisticated as we move on

I thought so. Could you tell me why and how you think it's otherwise?
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:25:32
Hi there! We started supporting sending to a bech32 address a year ago. For receiving, we preferred to wait till bech32 was more widely adopted to avoid users getting confused. We now feel comfortable with making it the default option for receiving bitcoins.

Opening and closing a payment channel implies broadcasting a transaction to the blockchain, thus paying on-chain fees and waiting for confirmation times. This is not in opposition to the second part of your sentence: "LN money is money in a pocket ready to spend", which I agree with.
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:50:56
Sure! But it wouldn't be convenient for customers to open channels with each merchant directly. It requires you to have your money split into different channels, pay more in fees and most likely timing isn't good either: when you want to buy something via the Lightning Network it is already too late to open a channel since you don't want to wait for confirmation times at the moment of paying. You should have open \*in advance\* channels with all potential merchants. Very inconvenient from the customers' perspective
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:06:36
What mobile wallet do you use?
@_date: 2019-02-20 18:01:22
So do you think it would be mostly a PR/Marketing move? Or is there a real use case for exchanges to implement Lightning?
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:05:23


I only described the problem. Wasn't really interested in pointing if it is or not a problem of the Lightning Network itself, who should solve it, or how. Just pointing it exists and why.
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:01:28
Thanks! No, i'm not looking for a privacy-oriented wallet like Samourai. Are there any mobile wallets particularly oriented to people who \*buy\* things with BTC?
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:00:39
Exactly. Opening (and closing) a payment channel requires money and time. They only make sense when they are updated more than once. If you transact on a regular basis with one merchant in particular that you can identify in advance, then opening a direct channel with them might makes sense. Otherwise it probably makes more sense to open a channel to a node with good outbound capacity, that can route your payments to different peers and reach different destinations.
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:31:41
You wouldn't be able to pay instantly if you don't have a direct channel with them (new merchant, for example) and they have no inbound capacity with other nodes. And this is the reason why inbound capacity is actually being bought by merchants in, for example, bitrefill. [
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:06:06
Wow, you are certainly a power user. Which wallet do you use?
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:56:34
Great! Thanks. Do you choose to pay in Bitcoin for privacy reasons? What mobile wallet do you use?
@_date: 2019-04-16 15:55:03
I see, ty. When paying to friends, are you mostly onboarding them to bitcoin? I mean, are they already bitcoin holders and you are simply paying them what you owe them or are you taking the opportunity (a sport bet or a meal) to send them their first fractions of btc and teach them about it?
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:23:30
Everytime you open a payment channel, you broadcast a transaction to the blockchain called funding transaction. The funding transaction is an on-chain transaction that has on-chain fees and confirmation times. This is why payment channels make sense if they are updated many times before getting closed (which also requires an on-chain transaction). Also, having to wait for confirmation times at the moment of paying is not convenient (and the whole purpose of Lightning, together with fees). This is why they should be open beforehand.  If you have many open channels, you will have you money split in different channels, which might be convenient in some cases but not in others (for example to pay or route a bigger payment).
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:38:40
Hey, this was the complete sentence: You wouldn't be able to pay instantly if you don't have a direct channel with them (new merchant, for example) and they have no inbound capacity with other nodes. Please, bear in mind the **AND.** If you are able to pay them instantly via Lightning, without having a direct channel with them, it's because someone else is routing the payment and providing the needed liquidity.
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:20:43


Not, we are not. The mere fact that you \*can\* open a direct channel or even make an on-chain transaction makes the whole protocol open and censorship resistant and different to Paypal. Isolated payment channels, without routing nodes, wouldn't be convenient for many cases.
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:01:15
Ok, it might not be your case I guess
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:48:11
Well, you can try running a node and **receiving** payments and see what happens... When you realize is not as straightforward as you think, you might see it as a problem. Bitrefill and LND have both detected it as a problem for merchants, and that's why they released Thor and Loop Out. I do agree that if you are mostly sending payments, it might not be a problem to you. Also, there's a whole post with practical solutions to it: [
@_date: 2019-04-16 15:41:02
Thanks! What are \*you\* using it for? Do you usually transact with friends using Bitcoin? In which cases? Have you ever purchased a gift card with Bitcoin? It seems to me all these use cases are things you \*could do with bitcoin\*, but very few people are actually doing.

Hi there! Take a look at Muun Wallet: [muun.com]( 
Muun is a non custodial wallet, very easy to use. You can login with email and password (password cannot be reset if you forget it, but you can set up a cold recovery code to use in that case), venmo-like payments, novel multi-sig 2-of-2 spending and publicly auditable (all except for the UI). Currently available in Android and soon in iOS.

On-chain fees depend on the weight of your transaction and how much you are willing to wait, so it is hard to compare those two transactions because these parameters might change in these scenarios. However, submarine swaps are more likely to actually be more expensive because of lightning fees and transactions to claim funds.
