A hard fork does not qualify as a new version. Otherwise Bitcoin gold, Bitcoin unlimited, Bitcoin XT, etc. would also be equally new versions of 'Bitcoin' as Bitcoin cash.

Me neither. But it is clearly a site promoting BCH *over* BTC, which is fine for it to do I suppose but it should not be listed on coinmarketcap as an official website for BTC, which is the original topic.

It promotes Bitcoin cash over Bitcoin, which means it should be the site listed for bitcoin cash on coinmarketcap, not bitcoin. I'm not here to discuss which coin is superior, all I'm pointing out is bitcoin.com is clearly not a bitcoin website, rather a bitcoin cash website. 
This can be misleading to new people who may confuse BTC for BCH. I'm sure neither side would want that to happen.... Right?

In a decentralized network every player does decide. Which is why the same people now behind Bitcoin cash tried to modify BTC in the New York Agreement, but failed to reach consensus and get it implemented. Which is why they so made their own coin by forking the Bitcoin main chain. 
As I said, not here to discuss which coin is better, but you simply can't call Bitcoin cash Bitcoin, they are different, unique coins with different visions. You can take the Bitcoin name by force but that will still not make BCH be BTC.

Visit bitcoin.com...
You don't need to believe what he says when you can see it for yourself.
The site promotes BCH, not BTC. The free wallet it offers right on the front even has BCH as the default currency.

You're completely right when you said things evolve. And part of evolution is natural selection. With the changes coming up for bitcoin, BCH will be rendered obsolete. Evolution.
Explain all the other forks then, which also solve the scaling issue but did not overtake Bitcoin. Bitcoin XT came way before bitcoin cash with the same solution as BCH, and guess what, it died out. Evolution...
The other forks I mentioned did not overtake Bitcoin and most likely neither will BCH. I will repeat once more, BCH is not a next version of Bitcoin.  It is it's own thing and both can co-exist just fine, as they are now. Which is part of evolution as well.
Regarding your example, cryptocurrencies are not software in the same way an operating system is. There is no central organization that decides when to make an update. All users decide together in a decentralized manner, which is why BCH was not an update, because the majority consensus was against the change, so the original product was left unmodified.

When you work on an exchange you are not making transactions. The exchange handles those things internally. When you transfer from one bitcoin wallet to another, you are making a transaction. That's the kind of transaction you can find here

Value compared to what? You could say the same for any fiat currency, and the point of it being decentralized is the only way value could drop is if nobody wants bitcoin, with Bitcoin there is no such thing as hyperinflation or a default of the government. The value won't drop to zero, because work was put into mining it, and people acquired it for some value at some point in time.

That's a pretty interesting concept. Thanks for sharing.

Yup, exactly. And why is this?
* Lots of people want to move their bitcoin right now. Be it for selling, or trading. This means there's lots of demand for transactions.
* When people's transactions don't go through in the timeframe they want, they raise the fee they pay so that miners notice their transaction first.
* This predicament leads to many people playing fee leap-frog in an already congested pool of transactions, making everything quite expensive and slow.
How can this be solved?
There are many propositions on how to up the number of transactions possible, or lower fees. 
* Make the block size bigger. This is what recent fork Bitcoin-Cash did (Not to be confused with Bitcoin). Make the amount of transactions that can be packed together bigger, allowing for more transactions. 
* Implement off-chain solutions. Lightning Network is a solution being developed right now. The basic premise is instead of piling everybody's transactions onto the blockchain, some can be offloaded into other types of transactions. This would especially help with the fees on small transactions.
* Abandon bitcoin for different technologies. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but that doesn't make it the best. There are other solutions to the transaction issue. What they have in common is that they change and tweak the framework of the original cryptocurrency idea. See currencies like IOTA, Ethereum, Ripple, Dash etc.
Hope this could help.

How to move on from BTC? That's a tough question. Bitcoin has the advantage of primacy. It is well known and widely used (relative to other coins). But basically, yes. The market needs to decide it no longer wants to use Bitcoin for it to be phased out. A different currency needs to be used more be it for trading, storage of wealth and transfer of wealth. Many people refer to this as the 'flippening'. 
I personally believe if/when the current issues with Bitcoin are fixed, it can continue to be the dominant cryptocurrency and healthily grow in adoption and use. But so far, progress is slow. 
But alas, only the future can tell. Keep your portfolio diverse and read the news, that is the best advice I can give.

No. 1 500 000 000 (USD) / 48 000 (USD per kg) = 31250 kg. You were off by about 31 tons ��

You can't invent stability, that would make it centralized. Bitcoin will only become stable once it has reached technological maturity, or be replaced by a superior cryptocurrency if it can't keep up. 
The reason it is unstable right now is that it's still in an adoption phase, and most people don't understand it (so-called "investors" too).

No but I wish it were.

No, I'm pretty sure it's red.
