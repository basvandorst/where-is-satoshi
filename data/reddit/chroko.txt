So what's your opinion about republican-backed voter disenfranchisement, corrupt campaign spending and gerrymandering?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:30:42
Some a-grade bullshit here.
Bitcoin is not a currency, it's a speculation vehicle.
Things *always get less expensive* when measured in Bitcoin because there's a cap on the number of them. And because of the built-in deflation it's useless for things like contracts, wages and running a business.
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:46:20
In a nutshell: it is impossible to fix prices in bitcoin because of the limited supply. You can't write a loan, price goods, or set wages. A currency needs to be able to grow alongside a growing economy and population. Bitcoin can't do that, so it's non-viable as a working currency.
It's useful for bartering and a store of value for speculation, sure - but not much more.
@_date: 2018-05-26 14:46:32
I'm all for crypto, but you sound dumb as hell by claiming "centralized banking doesn't work" - when it does in the vast majority of cases.
By your fickle metric, crypto doesn't work either because one of the altcoins collapsed....
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:05:08
I know you're joking, but here's a fun thought experiment to figure out how to replace a digital currency. It's probably impractical and would never work, but:
* Set a cut-off date where bitcoin will stop being generated.
* Copy bitcoin, including all the math done to mine blocks - so that we have bitcoin2.
* Start with all the bitcoin2 assets owned by a central authority.
* Have all the active users send their bitcoin to the central authority.
* The central authority sends users identical quantities of bitcoin2 in return.
After a cut-off date for exchanges, invalidate bitcoin - and everybody switches over to bitcoin2. The balance of unclaimed coins gets split up and sent out to everyone who cashed in. Transactions that were send to a blacklisted entity - like MtGox could be nulled and the bitcoin2 returned to the rightful owner. The central authority is then disbanded.
Ideally this would somehow be an embedded part of the protocol, but what we've done is wash an entire virtual currency, revitalizing and reclaiming all the coins that were lost or stolen. (Like that dude that threw away $7 million in BTC on an old hard drive.) Regular "washing" could take place every couple of years, to fixing all the theft and returning all coins to active users.

Also, since Bitcoin doesn't have fundamentals and has no tangible valuation there's nothing to devalue.

One Venezuelan economist is not representative of an entire country.

This is incredibly dumb.
The financial services industry provides great value to consumers and enhances the quality of life for their customers. With everything from loans to buy a car and house; to covering routine purchases &amp; groceries with a credit card until payday; to helping cover medical and travel emergencies; to protecting against fraud and scammers.
And in most cases, the cost of these financial services is cheap or free to consumers.
Suggesting all of the above can be replaced by Bitcoin is ridiculous and impossible and sounds like you've never lived outside of your parents' basement, have never worked a day in your life and have never had to pay your own bills and cost of living.

BTC has no fundamentals, no use case, no adoption.
Mobile wallets have been downloaded by just a few thousand people. Putting a "Bitcoin" sticker up at a retailer isn't a movement, it's just sad. Crypto barely works at the best of times, but is completely useless when internet or electricity is unreliable in the event of a crisis or disaster (so no, it's not going to be saved by a 3rd world country switching to Bitcoin.) Crypto is also not going to solve inequality or make holders rich overnight, it's even worse than fiat in that respect.
So the proof is really on those who say it will go higher. The only way that will happen is if they can repeat the lie that it's worth something and enough people believe them. The negatives are abundant.
@_date: 2019-03-18 20:46:35
Untrue, but a deflationary currency is functioning as designed. Fiat was never intended to be a store of value and a healthy economy is one where money keeps moving.

There are no fundamentals. It will only go up if a collective delusion of buyers think it will go up.
Whales are sitting on thousands and thousands of Bitcoin. They missed the chance to sell at the ATH, can't all sell at once without collapsing the price. So they're pumping up the price in any way they can to give themselves more chances to unload before it goes to $0.

Absolutely not, for the same reasons that Bitcoin is already not scalable and crippled by inequality with a small number of whales who own most of the supply.

Blockchain seems like a good idea to fight censorship, but it also seems like a very bad idea that a currency is open to being hijacked to carry those messages. It will be abused.
Your wallet shouldn't have to process spam messages and trolling before you can make a purchase at the corner store, but it will be forced to if this continues.

You'll be left with a series of random numbers that nobody cares about, on a device for which you have no power, with no way to communicate with a distributed currency network that no longer exists or thinks your wallet is valid.

Of course money should devalue - money is not the economy, just as the stock market is not the economy.
The purpose of money is to enable society, not to be stockpiled. Poor people think rich people have money, but rich people are trying to get rid of their money all the time. They use money to buy assets that will generate more money over time.
Bitcoin is not one of those things, which is why the truly smart money in crypto is buying blockchain companies, not cryptocurrencies themselves.

Microsoft is a very different company than it was even 5 years ago. Hosting services are now their most important growing business unit, which has new priorities regarding being open and accessible for developers.
Microsoft is also responsible for some major improvements in Git recently, as they adopted it as their internal revision control system and encountered performance and scalability problems -- and then contriubted fixes back to the community.
There no reason to suspect they'd be a bad stewards of GitHub, certainly they're not going to mess it up anymore than the horrible internal politics GitHub has had over recent years.

One of Buffet's principals is that if something doesn't do work then it's not an investment.
If you buy gold, it just sits there. It does no work.
If you buy stock in a company, that company brings in money and returns value to the shareholder. It does work.
Bitcoin falls into the former category. It doesn't do anything by itself. It is only worth what someone else is prepared to give you for it. This is why people like Buffet call it a speculation rather than an investment.
Simply buying and holding crypto is not good  for crypto - it needs to start being used to transfer value and not just as a store of value. Growth will be by wider adoption and buying / selling things and paying in crypto - not by the people who already own it stuffing it under their matress.

In the 1600's, 1lb of silver could buy 15 cows. Today, 15 cows are worth (conservatively) $25,000. Cost of 1lb of silver today: ~$450. That's a loss of 98% compared to the value of cows.
If something doesn't do work, it is not an investment. This applies to currency, precious metals and Bitcoin. Rich people invest in things that do work and produce more money: like stocks and businesses (such as with cows.) Poor people sit on cash - which does no work - and then they wonder why they are still poor.
Invest in things that are not currencies. Society is not going to bestow wealth on you for holding Bitcoin and doing nothing. Value creation and economies do not work that way.

Of course it's going to.
There is no demand for using Bitcoin, all the activity is trading. Fewer than 1000 Bitcoin addresses hold more than 60% of all mined coins, the most popular mobile lightning wallets have fewer than 5000 downloads.
The whales have accumulated so many coins that they have effectively "won", but it turns out that it's a game nobody else was playing and now they're stuck with a bunch of coins that nobody else wants and they can't unload without crashing the market.
The overall day-to-day trend is a slow decline - these jumps are clearly manipulation to make the price look more healthy, and a failed attempt at sparking a larger price movement.
The ATH was driven by massive FOMA, but all those speculators are gone - and the whales are left looking more like bagholders with a bunch of coins to unload that nobody wants.
Institutional investors bought crypto companies not coins, because they could see what a shitshow coins are.

Bitcoin has no fundamentals and is a purely speculative asset. It can't even be used in industrial manufacturing like gold (another speculative asset) which maintains a floor on the price.
So saying that it's a good time to buy Bitcoin is something you can't really defend. The only thing that sets the price is what people are willing to pay to buy it. If nobody is buying, it's worthless. The people who are not buying have judged it worthless and are setting the price.
ie: It is not valuable and will not increase in price until people think it is valuable and buy to increase the price. Bitcoin is a paradox, so don't expect it to go anywhere.
The last time the price was high, the only people to make money were the speculators who took profits off the backs of newcomers. And now you're complaining that the newcomers have all left and you want them to come back so you can take profits from them again? What the hell is wrong with you?

If you look at the charts, almost all Bitcoin is basically all owned by exchanges and whales. There are a lot of addresses / wallets, sure - but most have almost nothing in them.
The whales have succeeded in keeping the price high not because of demand, but by limiting supply and not selling too quickly. There are no other fundamentals.
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:58:10
The price also dropped from $20,000 to $3,000, it's amusing to me that people forget that there are no fundamentals and this is a purely speculative asset.
It's as likely to crash to under $1,000 from here as it is to double. The only thing holding the price up is how much someone else wants to pay for it - and that can wildly vary from day to day.

China was a country that had little electronic payment infrastructure and built it up from scratch to relatively modern standards, while rejecting tech from foreign companies.
It's much harder to retrofit existing infrastructure in the US because the benefits are small and incremental. Pay-by-phone in the US seems to be DOA for mainstream acceptance, even Apple is just issuing credit cards now.
Apple Pay was likely torpedoed by Apple's own hubris and squabbling over standards. The irony is that readers are widespread (tap-to-pay having been integrated into the latest card readers as a standard feature), but they are rarely used.
Chipped credit cards are an incremental improvement that seems to solve the security issues with magnetic stripes. They are likely good-enough technology that prevents the rise of anything else that isn't a quantum leap in usability and convenience.

A business provides goods and services. The operating profit of the company - plus any dividends, which are profits paid to shareholders as cash - provides a good valuation of the stock price. As companies grow the stock price typically also grows to reflect the growing business.
Meanwhile, a Bitcoin is a virtual token that is backed by nothing and is only worth exactly what someone else is willing to pay for it.
The value of a stock is part of what it is. If Microsoft irrationally went to $0.001 tomorrow and you purchased all of it, you would own a fabulously successful software company and - by doing nothing - soon you would be stinking rich with income from the dividend. They would pay you simply for being a shareholder.
The entire value of a Bitcoin is external, based on what someone else is willing to pay. If Bitcoin went to $0 and you purchased all of it, you wouldn't have anything. You'd be desperately trying to get other people to buy Bitcoin from you.
There is no asset protection in Bitcoin, because it has no internal value.
Warren Buffet is famously overquoted, but his stance was that investments must put your money to work. Money sitting in a bank does nothing. Gold sitting in a vault does nothing. Bitcoin sitting on the Blockchain does nothing. But investing money in a business... your money does work for you.

Yeah, it makes no sense. The correlation seems irrational and shows immaturity (or manipulation) in the price of Bitcoin. On 11/5 there was a perfect opposite movement (which would be expected for a mature store of value), but then on 11/7 and today, they moved drastically in the same direction.
Bitcoin should be a safe harbor for store of value, but people still bolt to cash / weird things happen whenever there's a slight twitch in the stock market.

There is no accurate prediction because there is no accurate valuation.
Bitcoin is objectively worth $0, because you can't build anything with it (unlike, say, gold) and it is infinitely replicatable (anyone can start their own fork.) It also earns no income (unlike stock in a company.) And if you thought the banks were corrupt: allow me to introduce you to the whales and miners.
Private investment won't save Bitcoin. I saw one speculative investment recommendation that said if you were really really interested, restrict crypto to no more than 0.1% of your portfolio to mange risk. Newsflash: that's no more than $1000 if you have a million dollars. Institutional investment isn't going to save Bitcoin, because the risk is just too high to make any commitment.
Also, how sick is Bitcoin if the community knows it's in trouble and is praying for institutional buyers to turn up so everyone cash out? Nobody wants your Bitcoin, or your used Blockchain.

Won't happen, for dozens of reasons.
Not least of which: you can't write contracts in Bitcoin. Due to scarcity (and the fact that the population is gradually expanding), everything would slowly get cheaper.
Which means that there's no point buying 1 Bitcoin of materials to make a product because by the time you go to sell it, the finished product is now worth less than 1 Bitcoin.
So even if you could magically make Bitcoin the dominant currency overnight, the economy would then immediately starve to death because it's more expensive to do anything than do nothing.

No, it's not. Converting completely to Bitcoin is just swapping one set of problems for another, and solves none of the societal problems that lead to inequality in the first place. Bitcoin is not going to magically make poor people rich and it's not going to magically generate food for starving people if a country's economy has collapsed.
"I've got Bitcoin, I'm rich!" only works if everyone else can agree on the value of that thing. If it's impossible to get then the liquidity is zero and the value is zero. When the last Bitcoin HODLer collects all 17 million coins, they will be homeless on the side of the road.
I agree that there are problems in the world that should be solved to make better lives for the underprivileged and those living in poverty, but it's a non-sequitur to suggest Bitcoin will magically solve all the problems because crypto. It does not track.


Fiat money is a vehicle for creating liquidity and enabling the economy. The mistake that you (and other poor people) make is thinking that money is an end to itself. It's not. Money by itself is valueless, the value is in what it can be exchanged for.
Poor people think rich people have money. Wrong. Rich people have investments that can generate or be traded for money, which is then used to acquire other investments. Inflation doesn't do anything when they are fully invested, the monetary value is just how they keep score.
Bitcoin will find a niche as a store of value that can be easily transferred, as a barter token for a limited number of transactions - and as a form of ad-hoc independent payments in countries where runaway hyperinflation takes hold (although they could instead just as easily adopt US Dollars, any other international currency or a stable coin instead of Bitcoin.)
But Bitcoin falls far short of being able to satisfy the requirements of an actual currency because it is illiquid and non-fungible. For example: if you want a loan to buy a house, Bitcoin immediately fails for that very basic currency use case.

It's not a currency. It fails spectacularly to fit any of the basic use cases of a currency. Including liquidity, usability to price contracts and wealth creation. The deflationary nature encourages hoarding, not use and spending. If Bitcoin was the only currency everyone would starve to death because it encourages massive inequality and is worth more when you don't spend it.

Your conclusion is wrong.
The idea of the technology is sound, Blockchain is a distributed shared database design with some revolutionary ideas. But that's completely separate from the implementation of Bitcoin.
As a "value token", "currency" or even "investment", Bitcoin is the dumbest idea since Beenie Babies. It has no privacy and barely has the capacity to function. The community repeatedly tries to clone it to dillute value. Bitcoin proponents are all "get rich quick" pyramid schemers who are trying to fuck each other over.
The long-term legacy of Bitcoin will be Blockchain algorithms being used in niche private corporate databases that the general public will never see.
So no, you shouldn't support the "currency" just because there's a neat idea at the heart of it. Bitcoin uses Blockchain, but Blockchain is not Bitcoin.

Gold is largely worthless and a niche commodity in the investing universe. It's a poor man's idea of what a rich man values.
Fiat is not the economy, but it enables the economy. Rich people don't hoard money, they build investments that earn them money.
The mistake poor people make is thinking that they're building wealth by hoarding money, they expect to be paid for money that is not doing any work.
Fiat currency is designed to be used and spent, which is why it's more profitable for farmers to grow and sell you food rather than sitting on their cash and letting you starve to death.
Bitcoin is doomed to the same myopic vision as the tin-foil hat preppers who buy bars of gold while waiting for an apocalypse that never arrives. Bitcoin is an interesting addition to a portfolio, but it's a niche speculation at best.

(Assange blamed Obama for his predicament and tried to take that out on the Democrats and US political system, in the futile belief that a republican government would help him.)
They may have started with ethical motivations, but are so far off track that they've become a disgrace to democracy and freedom of the press.

If you have the Coinbase app it comes with a price widget.
Although: the best investments are something that you trust to grow over time and basically never need to look at.
Having the value constantly on display may be more stress than it is worth if the price remains volatile.

It's not possible for a modern economy to work entirely with Bitcoin, in the same way that gold was unsuitable to price a vast economy that generates value. It also can't can't ever replace bank accounts and credit cards. But it can be analogous to pre-paid debit cards and small stores of precious metals.
Some of the barriers are that Bitcoin accounts can't be frozen, transactions can't be forcibly undone, payments can't be initiated by the recipient and keys can't be changed. These are unique advantages of Bitcoin, but it's incredibly useful to have those tools as a banking customers. You can freeze your account if your debit card is stolen; undo a transaction if a shady retailer scams you - and make recurring monthly automatic payments for your bills.
Bitcoin does some things well, a lot of things badly - and because nobody's really in charge, a lot of the problems are going unfixed. It needs a centralized brand / app that people can easily understand. Only 5000 people have installed the Lightning Network phone app, the "hack a node together yourself" approach feels a lot like early Linux adoption (where Linux basically stayed on the sidelines except in variants like Android.)

The constraint of supply is part of the reason that Bitcoin will never be widely adopted.
Society will not make instant millionaires out of a few hundred Bitcoin hodlers for sitting on their ass and doing nothing. Get-rich-quick pyramid schemes only work for the first few whales who manage to convince dumb followers to part with their money.

I see a lot of parallels to Linux adoption.
Linux had a lot of hype in the early days. The "year of the Linux desktop" predictions failed so much it became a running joke as users realized that it was complicated, had fragmentation problems with competing standards and it couldn't exactly replace existing systems. It wasn't completely compatible with their hardware and wouldn't run games.
20 years later, the hype of Linux has faded into the background. The average person on the street could barely tell you what it is - but Linux is quietly sitting in the background and running lots of things on the internet. It's not always the most photogenic, but it can solve some difficult problems that nothing else can.
The Bitcoin story is unfolding in a similar way.
Over the past year, we had the hype of people trying to buy Bitcoin and not knowing what to do with it. It was complicated and volatile. Advocates made wild promises that didn't pan out - it is literally impossible to use as a replacement for fiat currency across an entire financial system - so stop lying about that. But as the technology and adoption matures, society will gradually figure out the use cases for which it is indispensable and it will find its place alongside the existing financial structures. We'll look up in 20 years and Bitcoin will be there, in the background, quietly working away. It won't change the world, but it will make it slightly better.

Your post had a lot of really good points, but then you go and say silly things like this that are a discredit to the entire Bitcoin community.
It's not possible for an economy to function using Bitcoin, just as the gold standard was completely infeasible. Fiat is absolutely 100% necessary to produce a functioning economy and society - but Bitcoin can live quite happily in perpetuity as a cherry on top (alongside gold and other stores of value / investment products.)
In B4 whining about corrupt banks: the problem society has is with corruption, not that central banks and fiat currency exist. Central banks and fiat currency are a vital part of a healthy economy that stops you from starving to death. Bitcoin alone can't save Venezuela, but it can help relieve the symptoms for some until it recovers.

Bitcoin is a bad investment and a bad store of value.
Unlike good investments, it has no worth beyond what you can convince someone else to pay for it. And some of the fundamental properties (such as illiquidity) are impassable barriers to broad financial adoption (for the same reasons that gold failed.) The deflationary nature makes it unusable for contracts.
While some ideas like Blockchain are neat, the practical implementation of Bitcoin is terrible. Hacks like lightning aren't going to fix it. And the advantages (such as easier international transfers) are not significant. (Who does international transfers, ever?)
Shills on here with ridiculous made-up valuations or "predictions" should be in jail for financial fraud and trying to run a pyramid scheme.

Yeah, this is risky while dollars still rule.
It feels like it's going to be a really great time to move the market with proof-of-key participants not being able to quickly sell if the price starts to drop. The setup is similar to companies going bankrupt that allow the executives to sell, but freeze employee stock (so they get nothing, like Enron.)

Bitcoin can't replace fiat because Bitcoin is finite and can't map to real-world wealth. You're missing out on the entire history of money by not understanding this.
The problem with gold was not ease of transactions, it was that gold was unevenly distributed around the world, was barely adequate for a feudal bargaining economy - and is a paradox: if gold was its own currency, how would miners price and sell gold when it is priced in... itself? If you were an old-timey gold miner, unless you were giving it away - you would need to sell it. So your wealth is going to be in something else, like camels or land. It's the same deal with Bitcoin.
Or another example: imagine one village owns and uses all 21 million Bitcoin as currency. Some children of the village leave and start an identical village across the river but they use banana leaves as currency. Many years later (when populations have stabilized), both villages decide to start trading with each other and standardize on a currency. The bread sold in banana leaves is just as nutritious and valuable as the bread sold in Bitcoin, but what's the combined value of the new economy with two identical villages? It should be 42 million Bitcoin, but that's impossible.
Bitcoin enthusiasts like to angrily judge governments for printing money, but generating new money as society grows is the engine of wealth creation and is essential for a healthy economy.

Cryptographic electronic money is a good idea.
Bitcoin is not.
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:04:55


Don't be so silly.
Bitcoin is an inherently unusable as a currency. For speculation? Sure. For doing business: no. Why? Because you can't print any more of it. Despite rumors to the contrary, this is absolutely essential to grow an economy.
See my previous comments [here]( - tl;dr: infinite deflation makes business impossible because there's no point if you have to sell finished products for less than the cost of raw materials. This is why the gold standard failed.


If they want electronic money, they're more likely to come up with a secure alternative that fixes Bitcoin's problems, call it FedCoin. With the difference that they can issue new FedCoins with a fixed 1:1 exchange rate to the dollar and that they run a partly-distributed transaction database.
