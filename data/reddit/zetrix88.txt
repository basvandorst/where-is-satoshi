There was written in the corner of the display current price of btc, it showed 184 589 CZK, And gdax was showing 174 400 in that time.

Yeah, It would be insane like that. I didnt try to do anything. I hope they would show the current price of BTC for withdrawing, if they showed only the higher one it would be bit scammy imo. But of course they wont give you extra profit, in that case I could just stay there all day buying and selling and make millions :D

One of my most favorite answers by him, this made me realize that I should invest much more into BTC. I thought regulation is the biggest risk in investing into BTc and it probably is,  but it just doesnt really matter.

Yeah, I hope it will decrease over time when there will be more of them. Still doesnt bother me right now, hodling for the win.

Hmmm, must be it. But didnt expect the difference to be that big. The weird thing is that I could withdraw BTC to CZK or buy BTC from it, Wouldnt withdrawing give me more BTC than I should get when the value is 10k CZK higher in there?
EDIT: ( not that I want to withdraw I am proud hodler)

Roger Ver can be everything he wants to be. And if you disagree you are just envious because you are not him.
