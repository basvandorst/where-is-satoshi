The world is changing. Soon no one will be using morally questionable centralized fiat "currency".

Some people just have no awareness of their own consciousness :)

By embracing a fatalistic "survival of the fittest" attitude you neglect all the sociological empathies that are inherent in man kind. You strip away the potential for man to ascend and become better than a mere self interested animal. There were a great deal of pains and immoral actions in the history of man, but there were also acts of kindness and sacrifice and scientific discovery.

But that's the thing... every system is exploitable.

Um... what does this have to do with the topic at hand?

People keep attacking the mechanisms instead of the people behind it... I am not saying blame the junkie (although Naked Lunch, a novel written by a junkie might push that narrative) -- but perhaps we should look at what drives people to get together and conspire to build a corporation that's aimed at damaging public health for private interest in the first place? Perhaps we should look at the *motivations* people have in a system before we criticize the system?
For example, one might argue that both the United States and Nazi Germany incorporated elements of capitalism/free-market economics (yes yes, I know the Nazis were 'national socialists', but bare with me for the sake of the argument...) does that mean they are ethically equal systems of governance? Is Cuba or Bolivia as bad as North Korea?
I feel like we spend so much time focussing on the systems and politics and strategies and forgetting the most important element in any human society: the human. If our motivations and morality are shit, we will end up having a shit society. No matter what political or judicial system we have in place.
Sorry, I got worked up there... rambles.
