Right? That's fucking amazing how they allowed a 120k BTC withdrawal all at once. DAFUQ?

Just checked it out. Didn't recall that they only lost $5M - BFX really screwed up this time then.

Like they haven't been hacked before.

Wait guys how serious is this? Do I really have to change all my passwords? Holy fuck cloudflare. Someone please confirm.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:31:18
Oh I thought next stop was $11111
@_date: 2017-02-24 08:32:17
Does this mean if there's a site I logged into that is using Cloudflare without 2FA, then I might get hacked because Google cached my pw?

I think if ATMs had lower fees they might actually make more money because more people would actually use them. 5.8% is a huge fee. And that above exchange rate ATM is really dishonest.

I dunno how much bitcoin ATMs in your guys' cities cost but in mine, fees are 6%+ and I would never use one.

Did this actually happen? Can any Reddit detectives confirm?

Wow, still remember trading alts at BTER 4 years ago.

Sounds like you can go bug coinbase a bit with emails and see if they respond.
@_date: 2015-09-29 03:40:18
And kittycoin or something similar iirc

Every exchange will eventually get "hacked"
@_date: 2016-07-12 23:01:55
Are you serious?
@_date: 2016-07-11 23:15:50
Cool, and it only took a 20% fee.
