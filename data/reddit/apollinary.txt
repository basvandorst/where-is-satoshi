Let's do an experiment? In which country are you?
Buy the file for $ 1 from my link. I will return this amount $2 to you in Bitcoin.
If you agree I'll give you a link. The information in the file does not matter ... If you can buy a file with your card I will refund you $ 2
This is beneficial)) This is an interesting experiment
Waiting for reply...

The crypto environment in Ukraine - is good. Banks, government law and regulation cannot ban bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:37:50
Okay ... but you gave up the experiment. ))
You wrote that you can buy using a debit card. But the bank controls your money. The Bank allows you to buy on Aliexpress, and will it allow you to buy something else? .. What will be the fees?
When your money in the bank is not your money.

Socialism is evil.
Government regulation is evil.
Revolutions bring other parasites to power, but the system of government does not change. Revolutions do not succeed for the people.
Evil must be combated by ignoring government and governments laws. Do not obey governments regulations. Government regulations no profit for you.
Instead of government money surrogates, use bitcoin!

This puzzle was solved. Man received bitcoin award. This is cool.
It is a good idea to introduce students to Bitcoin as a reward for their knowledge.
Create a bitcoin address to reward for solving scientific puzzles for young people.

With bitcoin you can buy photos even with penguins in Antarctica. ))

White box - is bitcoin miner.
You can find all the information online ... or on their website

No QR code.
These Christmas tree decorations are good with bitcoin ))

It's mining bitcoin that benefits heat in your home. It can be real decentralization.
Commentators who are dissatisfied or distrusted are there problems if they cannot verify this information on their own.
@_date: 2019-12-25 09:42:22
Yes - choose. People do not understand the benefits of bitcoin. They consider government surrogates to be money.
@_date: 2019-12-19 06:04:18
Bitcoin is real money.
I have a story why bitcoin is better than fiat money.

What I put is my business. If you are not an idiot, you do not trust me and check the information yourself.
But you write stupid questions ...
I can answer you: I gave the link to FB because this link contains the name of the site you post. The FB page has photos and videos that are not on the site. The FB page has links to the site, phones, messenger ... - it's much easier to interact with the manufacturer. Do you understand my answer?

Interested in this information?
Do you have hands? Can you use Google search?
I do not advertise for this company, so I have not published their site. I wrote what they created. They are on facebook and there are these white boxes pics they are exposed - you will see the electronic circuit as it has the structure.

Bitcoin is shady I see from another point of view.
To me, a shady government.
There is simply no understanding, no demand for what is profitable, no demand for freedom.

I can sell you a video file for 10,000 satoshi  )))  joke... )))
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:27:27
Ok ))This is an example of restrictions and regulations. You can't buy on the debit card anything because you have fears.
You can buy anything for bitcoin - there is no fear.
If you agreed to the experiment, I think it would not work. Your bank will forbid you ...
Aliexpress is what your bank allows you to do.

Can you double spend with your mobile wallet? Are you profitable to do this for $2?
There are payments that do not require immediate confirmation of the transaction. This payment is a small amount. Pay for an order at a cafe or restaurant when you pay and wait 20-30 minutes for a meal.
If this is a supermarket that has a fast flow of customers - yes, there is a need for LN.
If the product is expensive - yes, confirmation or LN is required.
@_date: 2019-12-25 12:17:09
I always use a low fee (1sat/byte) - the transaction always goes through.
Yes, there are delays, but the transaction is always confirmed unless you are trying to create a competing transaction.
The transaction is transmitted to different nodes and it is very difficult to remove it from the network.
Most mobile wallets will not allow you to create a competing transaction with a larger commission.
Yes, it is possible to make a competing transaction, but it is more expensive and requires knowledge.
$ 5 is not fake - it's not profitable ))

It seems they wanted to open an institution, but then something stopped.
@_date: 2019-12-19 10:28:46


Maybe it's a visualization - I don't know. But the information is accurate.
I have provided links in comment - there are photos and videos and they will give any answer. Hopefully I will not be banned for this link here )))
@_date: 2019-12-23 10:51:41
I urge all... )))
In fact, many people are willing to sell their goods for bitcoin.

Bitcoin empowers you in a one-on-one way, passing the numbers, passing the right to other people - it's money, it's the same as gold in your pockets - it's only you.
The banks allow you to manage the money. If the bank bans - you will lose the right to money.
Do you see a difference?
Even the paper money in your pocket does not belong to you - the button that turns on the printing press belongs to the government. The government can create an emission money and your money in your pocket will be depreciated.
Since the 1970s, the dollar has lost 6 times its purchasing power. What you could buy for $ 100 in 1970, today you need to give away $ 600. Do you find this money profitable? You have been denied the right to save money!

I think that **altcoins is** **not bitcoin inflation**. Altcoins are other money, other money systems.

Essence of money in the universalization of economic relations. What does it mean? This means that money is becoming one thing for everyone. There is no sense in the amount of different money, if there is one thing, universal, such as bitcoin.
One tribe had money for furs, another tribe had money for grains, another tribe had little money for stones. Gradually, mankind comes from the general money - gold. Similarly, altcoins are furs, stones, and grains that will eventually cease to be money.
