Not my job to do research for you. If I wanted to be a coin broker I would.

Someone has to hold the BTC bags. Thanks for volunteering.

So you’re saying you’re too lazy to read? Guess you’ll have to stick to bitcoin then. Whatever. More people to hold the bags

Yep, and that was twice as much traffic alone as the bitcoin network could have handled. It amuses me when bitcoin supporters try to use this as an attack on ethereum. Bitcoin can’t even handle its own traffic, much less all of the apps and ICOs that the ethereum network handle on top of their own currency.

Check coinmarketcap.com. There are hundreds of them

Ethereum handles more value transactions than all other blockchains combined at this point. If bitcoin disappeared today, that wouldn’t change, it would just increase.

At 7tps, with the amount of new users signing up for exchanges in record amounts, it seems like standard high usage. Unless they up the blocksize or speed up the block generation timer, this will happen again if there’s ever high demand for moving btc around. However I think most people have learned their lesson, and have now decided to use ETH or LTC instead because of bitcoins poor performance.

It’s not nearly enough to keep up with demand. BTC missed its chance, as did all of its forks.

As I’ve told other people, someone has to hold the bags. Thanks for volunteering

The specs are way better than btc. 4x faster block creation means 4x as many transactions.

So it’s basically removing bitcoin from the equation is what you’re saying. So now there is no longer a decentralized public general ledger that things happen on, they happen on this other network which sounds like it defeats the purpose of having bitcoin altogether.

Looks good man. One suggestion, on the holdings page when adding an entry, add an extra field for total price that can auto-calculate. I keep finding I have to go to the calculator to find out what the unit price is, because everything I have is in total price. Have it calculate both ways. My current portfolio tracker ‘crypto pro’ has the ability and it’s a lifesaver for a number of reasons. 
Really like the graph view btw. Especially with 1hr support. Great

It’s called a stop loss. People have them set to sell automatically when a price hits a certain point. They might not have even been logged in for days or weeks.
