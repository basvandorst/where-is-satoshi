Very true :)
At the moment my plan is to average down on those two investments since I have some of those two already.
Both offer dividend so they’re not a complete bust. My strategy for those is long term, but knowing what I know about tech (I’m in tech) I anticipate them to bounce back while the market fear about the tariffs is over. If they do bounce back I’ll sell the portion I bought.
Anyway that’s my plan. If BTC stays around the same at that point I’ll buy back in.
Thanks for your non-lolwtfbro responses :)
Edit: Also, I have open orders for stop loss for my portfolio so if the market gets truly fucked I will be able to salvage stuff for the most part.

You’re welcome. HODL in my stead please. It’s been an honor gentlemen.

$2000 is a lot of money. I wouldn’t call it “barely”. I can invest this into something else or just save it.
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:54:53
While I agree with investing what you don’t need, I also believe in not blindly hodling regardless of being able to put that money to better use.
So no, I don’t need it urgently, but I see another opportunity for quicker gains at the moment.

Ah I see! Thanks for that info. Will look into ONT for sure! Cheers!

You’re kind of coming across as smug. I can tell you want to look down on me for my decision; whatever floats your boat.
Just don’t forget that any form of investing is essentially a gamble in the end. Some win and some lose.  And some know when to play another game. I chose to play another game.

A bit of cash and a bit of bitcoin is always better. Please don’t go all in on any investments and have some actual liquid assets lying around.
IMO a 3:1 split for liquid:investments is always a safe ratio.

Good for him if so. I broke even and don’t regret my decision. I will put this money into something else. Maybe even build that PC I’ve been wanting to for a while.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:51:12
Like what happened with 50 Cent.
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:23:12
Broke even. No regrets. And a sincere thanks for your kind thoughts :)

I agree with you; unfortunately, most of this thread seems to have made up it's mind.
Both Crypto AND Stocks are awesome.
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:45:39
I honestly think that’s an unsafe way of thinking. Never have all your eggs in one basket.
Not sure why I’m in the negative. Do people really not agree with avoiding going “all in”?

Like I said, both have pros and cons. To blindly choose one thing over another without research is very close minded. I'm by no means an expert on either crypto or stocks, but I know enough to know what I don't know, and to keep an open mind about both instead of getting emotional about it and "hating" one or the other.
Regarding losing money, that argument can be said for crypto as well. The value of cryptocurrencies is also prone to manipulation whether you like it or not, and some people have put their retirements or houses on the line for it. I'm still not sure what you really meant by that statement. It sounds like a very emotion driven statement. If one invests moderately and with a contingency plan, they're not going to lose their retirement / house unless they use it as a collateral for a loan, which is a bad idea regardless of whether you're using it for crypto or stocks. Going all in into anything always has severe risks associated with it.

Saying that there's a ton of bullshit involved in buying stocks because you can't find an easy way to buy canadian weed stock from the UK is like me saying that crypto sucks because I can't buy dogecoin from coinbase.
If your specific situation isn't working out, that sucks, but it doesn't make your statement of "wait until you see monthly fees and initial paying fees and other bullshit for stocks.." accurate at all.
Anyway, I can smell an internet argument coming. I really have nothing more to say, so let's agree to disagree and leave it at that.

Yeah let’s just hope this post doesn’t end up being cross posted in @_date: 2018-03-12 04:32:46
I don’t know. I need to think about this.

You have a choice of different investment firms for stocks as well. Also, you don't have to do it yourself and can use something like Acorns.
The stuff you said about crypto is accurate, but the part about stocks sounds like confirmation bias.
Both have their pros and cons and can be very lucrative when used in the right balance.
"Saying that crypto is great and stocks are not" is the other side of the "crypto is terrible and stocks are great" coin.

Crypto hasn't even had a chance to fork/develop into "historically safe" and "aggressive" currency yet. That being said, let's say that "historically safe" is bitcoin and "aggressive" is ethereum and litecoin for the sake of argument. You saw what happened a few days ago. People who were putting all of their faith into bitcoin also lost a lot of money because of the crash followed by a panic sell. You're comparing an infant technology to the stock market which has been around for decades. Give crypto time to grow and eventually capitalism will snake it's way into it and the same kind of shit will occur. For example, an entire nation could release a news statement saying they're banning crypto, wait for the price to plummet, secretly buy up a ton of it, and then recant their original statement. What's stopping this from happening today? In fact, I can bet you that shit like this is already happening as we speak. Like it or not, the little guy is being fucked over regardless of what he/she invests in.
And if crypto ends tomorrow or slowly dies over the next 5 years, people WILL be affected. There are people out there who've taken out mortgages to go all in for bitcoin. There are others who are using bitcoin as a retirement investment. The world WILL be affected if bitcoin crashes. Not as much as 2008 but there will definitely be a TON of people affected.
See, what you have here is a generation of young investors who are finally feeling empowered that they have some say in what they're investing their future in, which is great. But at the same time, that empowerment can be taken too far and someone might start saying that crypto rocks, everything else sucks. Empirically, that's a terrible attitude to keep about anything. You should always weigh the pros and cons for everything, even things you hate. There are things about the stock market that are amazing, and a smart investor will be able to make the most of it, even in a situation like 2008. I think, to sum it up, don't put all your eggs in one basket, and certainly don't hate one basket over the other. A basket is a basket.

I stand corrected. That being said, it would be nice to see that integrated into some of the bigger players.

Couldn't agree with you more. I love crypto, but I feel like it's putting a lot of people into the mindset that crypto is the future and every other form of investing will be made obsolete. Comparing crypto to stocks is like comparing apples to oranges.... or rather, cellular technology to GPS technology. Both have their unique place, and when used together, can do wonders.
Also, people fail to realize that Crypto doesn't yield dividend payout like stocks. With stocks, I can buy some which yield dividend, and gain the benefit of both, rising value, as well as dividend payout.
Hating stocks is an understandable feeling as it's been dominated by the baby boomer demographic for a very long time, but with the rise of apps and websites which make trading super easy, a lot of younger folks are getting into trading which makes me very happy to see.
FWIW, I have some great recommendations for apps that can start you off on trading. Acorns and Robinhood for a start.
