I have a mining question.
So Bitmain's Antminer S9 is arguably the most efficient ASIC miner currently on the market. More specifically, Bitmain achieved this by using 16nm chips, correct? 
My question is: Is there a 14nm ASIC miner like the S9 currently on the market?
Additional question: If these chips are currently available, are they only available as single chips, or has a company compiled a device similar to the S9 to be sold to the general public?

Jesus Christ. I’ve taken cryptography classes through my cyber security degree, but I’m even having a hard time understanding. And he’s even trying to dumb it down and explain it in laymen’s terms ��

If you think about it, Bitcoin has been in like 5 bubbles and they've all popped. Amazon was in the .com bubble and it popped. Now Amazon stock is over $1000.

IOTA is interesting. Has a cool idea, idk if it will take off though. Micro-payment idea being free and whatnot is cool (that's my understanding of it), but the adoption isn't there just yet.

It’s an ongoing joke about the price fluctuations of cryptocurrency. You buy and then the price corrects, you sell, then the price rises...

Oh no, this post is mainly sarcasm lol. I bought in about $10k worth when it was around $3k! ��

I’ve definitely been watching cryptocurrency everyday since 2015 ��
My post is mainly sarcastic.

Oh I definitely believe!!

Don’t worry, I do have a strict budget and even though I live paycheck to paycheck, it’s only because I use the remaining funds from my paychecks to invest more into cryptocurrency �� my bills usually only amount to about 50% of my income
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:31:01
Lol, that’s what I made this post for!!
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:28:35
Yes! I try to buy in at good times, but also just when I get paid. DCA is the way to go!

You can never outsmart such an irrational market. Anyone who says they did are lying or just extremely lucky lol

I try my best to do chart analysis for cryptocurrency, but it’s very hard! Definitely something a seasoned trader will have better luck at. I like reviewing what people say on TradingView.com, it’s a pretty good place to see what ideas others have

I’m not emotional about it �� I’m just saying I bought so naturally the price will go down.
Just trying to help y’all out ��

Thanks friend!

No more amateur hour. I love it. I’m glad this was avoided.

I know, it’ll be glorious!!

Exchanges must have liquidity to pay investors. Technically they could lie and be insolvent, but that would mean the demise of the exchange and a lot of people going to jail for fraud.
