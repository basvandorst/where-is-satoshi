What more proof do u need dummy. The proof is in my account called BFX TOKENS.
They didn't exactly hide the fact of what they did. You're not the brightest apple are you?
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:37:34
I'd like to point out that there's a concerted effort by Bitfinex and it's affiliates to shut down any discussion on this subject. These topics are instantly downvoted. Don't be discouraged by this, there's a genuine interest in this topic.
Refer to Phil's drunken interview here about them manipulating Reddit:
If this isn't done by Bitfinex (which i doubt) I would like people to explain why is this topic downvoted constantly in both r/bitcoin and r/bitcoinmarkets This is a trading sub. Plenty of traders lost a lot of money over there. Downvoting a topic you don't like is against the rule of Reddit and against Rule 1 of this sub.
Plenty of people have lost money here and it hurts noone but Bitfinex to have this discussion. Are we really going to trust them at this point?
No independent audit, no info on how much they're contributing. Plus as you can listen in Phil interview about, they're kept about $7mil of funds for legal action. Meaning our haircuts could've been smaller.
No info on how the hack was done. No responsibility or firing of any employee. How do you expect a company that has clearly shown gross incompetence to come back and pay you back?
Burying your heads in the sand will not stop the coming lawsuits. It's beyond naive. Downvotes don't mean anything in a court of law. By avoiding this discussion you're leaving us with no choice but to pursue legal action.
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:14:05
Hilarious and sad at the same time. In retrospect all those crashes and laggy shit platform makes sense with these people at the helm.
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:27:29
Getting what? Where's the audit to confirm the 36%?
In the interview Phil confirmed that they held back the equivalent of 10% of tokens. So YOU DID NOT get whatever you were going to get sir. You got short-changed.
Furthermore how the f*Ck did u miss my other points sir? 
Do you really think Bitfinex, the largest USD exchange by trading volume before the hack wouldn't have been offered a buyout by Coinbase or another party during the restructuring? Are you not aware that companies can and frequently come out of bankruptcy restructured, under new management hopefully?
You're really naive if you think Bitfinex did anything here but save their jobs. They don't care about any of us.
@_date: 2016-08-13 17:08:39
It's Bitfinex doing the blocking here not banks...
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:02:10
Zane there's not a single number in this so called 'update'. How much exactly did you contribute? The only figure we know about is 10% of tokens was held back so you can fight off our lawsuits. 
Don't you think it's a little perverse to hold back 3.6% of our funds so you can use it to hamper our attempts to get it back? The haircut could've been 32.4% not 36%.
Second, why are you not replying to any of our emails requesting compensation? Even a simple NO will do. If this silence continues you leave us with no choice but to pursue legal action and involve all relevant authorities in this case.
Third what happened to providing more details about the tokens? You said this will happen 5-6 days ago and even in this update there is nothing new about it. To follow up on this, how many lawsuits and investigations are you facing right now? As a token holder I demand to know this info because it could greatly impact the value of my holdings. Any lawsuit or unpaid claim could force you into liquidation or bankruptcy and this will likely mean a big fat 0 for us token holders.

Thanks Todd known shill finex account. We get to see what Bitfinex wants us to believe but not be obligated by law by idk...emailing everyone?
Are we really gonna believe this unknown 11d redditor got super treatment from Bitfinex? Me and many others are still waiting for reply.
Furthemore, they didn't send out an email about the hack, or the subsequent stealing of 36% of our funds. But they made sure to send out a super long reply to super Todd here...a reply that starts with: 


Cmon...what support would include this bit


And then Todd over here magically posts this somewhere where there is a 'number of users',f*cking Reddit.
Obvious Bitfinex shill is obvious. If you guys want to make a statement why don't you make it public and EMAIL EVERYONE. How about that novel concept Bitfinex? So we have something in writing with which to hold your feet to the fire?
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:29:46


Well, retard, the point of my posting is to address vicious replies by obvious sock puppets like you. This all started after I opened my new sub 
This is a place where we gather info and pool resources for a potential joint action against Bitfinex. So I'm not 'barking' you nonsense tool, I'm addressing FUD spread by few days old accounts like you.
Just look at your anry foaming at the mouth reply. Why so vicious unless you have a direct financial interest in Bitfinex. It's really obvious what you guys are doing. We already heard in that drunken Phil interview that you organize upvoting/downvoting on reddit.
Are you gonna stop or should I request action from the mods and ban your sock-puppets too bitfinex? It will be really hard to upvote your nonsense without these 10 days old accounts.
If anyone still doubts me particular sock-puppet posted no less 4 times then in this thread over here (out of total of 17 comments) It's a thread opened by (allegedly) a partner at the law firm Harvey &amp; Binnall
Noone replied to him, he just attacks the OP four times in quick succession. One of them literally says 
'Damn you are getting down voted like crazy'
The other 3 comments, saved for posterity are 
'Stop ambulance chasing.. Sorry you need to resort to Reddit to drum up customers.. If you try to sue them for a few people and something happens to Bitfinex then you are hurting way more people then you are representing..'
'You have been a Redditor for 1 hours LOL Are you really that desperate to bring in the clients?'
'A ton of legal fees Thats what you have to lose.. Or you can ride it out for a while and see if Bitfinex makes good on their BFX tokens.. They just went live marging trading about 10 mins ago'
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:32:43
Cut the crap Todd. They're not replying because they don't want to give our lawyers any extra ammunition. 
Why didn't we get an email about the hack, or an email about resetting our passwords (Which everyone was forced to do upon login) or an email about them taking 36% of our funds.
Yet poor Todd with his 11 day Reddit account got a looooong reply that starts with

Are you really trying to spin this? YOU WERE HACKED. 
The minimum you could've done is EMAIL EVERYONE. Guys change your passwords they might have been compromised. This is what you asked everyone to do when we logged in. Or was that just security theater? 
Also noone got an email about the 36% haircut either. Don't you think stealing your customer funds requires you to send an email to EVERYONE. 
It even says right there on the theft 'extraordinary loss adjustment'. I think anything extraordinary requires an email don't you think? Especially considering you're not a futures platform and the option of socialized losses was never in the TOS.
If you were on holiday and not checking Bitfinex website or your posts, you would've never known that the hack or the subsequent raiding of funds happened.

@_date: 2016-08-12 14:33:44


Exactly. They should've waited weeks or how long it took to get the audit done.


These are the same people that lost $70 MILLION of our money. They can not be trusted.


Like I said they're worried about themselves first. Using that money would've cut our 'haircut' further. 


It's really poor form for them to take my money and used it to pay lawyers to fight my lawsuit. 


I can assure you, taking clients assets and converting them to some token is a much harsher breach of law than breaking a regulation. They should've taken the necessary time needed to convert their company so they can issue shares etc...
Rushing and forcing this solution just makes everything worse. The tokens are only worth 28 cents on the dollar now. That shows the market has no faith that Bitfinex will pay us back in full. And with 70-80% of bitcoins gone, they will have a hard time generating the fees needed to pay us back.
This chosen solution happening right before our eyes is the real disaster not the imaginary liquidation process in the future.

I would like to know if anyone else got a similar email. Especially with the wording about the tokens noted above. I think we're getting this 'statement' from a known bitfinex shill account because the above statement about the tokens couldn't be made on regular channels due to legal reasons.
Under the TOS that Bitfinex wrote themselves these tokens don't obligate you or them anything. 
Anyone else got a similar email huh? Maybe from 1 year old reddit account not 11 days? This guy has put a lot of effort into defending Bitfinex and viciously attacking anyone who suggests a lawsuit, I identified him as a shill account days ago 
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:13:52
Lawyers are already involved and more will get involved really soon. And soon the police and every regulatory authority will be on this case. I guarantee it.

This isn't a joke. Bitfinex is too big for you to get away with this crazy socializing scheme. People will sue.

Which part of my post do you disagree with? Saying you lost there's nothing you can do is inaccurate. For example a single unpaid claim over 10,000 HK can put Bitfinex in liquidation. So at a minimum, I have this power.
At that stage some of the points I made in my post become relevant, like replacing management or being bought up by a competitor.

Ancap here. I really wonder if a political (dare I say propaganda) speech given on a tech conference will really bring people to bitcoin? Plus there are several outrageous claims with no basis in reality.
He claims that war is supported by fiat currency and money printing.
Problem is lots of countries outside the US wage war even though they can't effectively print their own money (because they have to keep a good ratio of local currency to foreign reserves). 
Russia and other petronations (Saudis) fund unrest all over the world with oil money. Using bitcoin will not change this, it's wishfull thinking by Americans who have no idea how the rest of the world works (I know Stefan is Canadian but he focuses on US news 99% of time)
