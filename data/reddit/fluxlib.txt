Profit taking is not a bad thing.

What I think he just said is that the trustless decentralized blockchain networks would cut right through the bullshit idiot middlemen and their shit fees and slow sloppy transactions.  I think.
I think a lot of us reckon there is some money in that.  I have a few big bets that there is some money in that.
And he's right.  People just think bitcoin and laugh because the think it's buying air.  They don't understand what it brought to the world.  Once I got even a remote grasp of what these networks can do, that's where I went.  A few currencies, but I like the platforms, especially those setting up teams to help integrate.  
And LOL, let em laugh. When there's a crypto exhange built into their online bank accounts maybe they will remember the chuckles they had while we watched patiently and held our coins.

My sentiment exactly
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:55:09
If it went that low I would double down on my position.  Not even a second thought on that.

It means Etherium was dumped hard by the ICO's going out of business.

If I keep buying, 10k EOY.  If I sell everything and move on from Crypto 40k EOY.

LOL.  More naive actually.  Right?

I downvote all of those.

PRICE GOES DOWN!!!
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:20:01
If the price starts pumping and coinbase is frozen......yep. 
It’s the SEC hearing. Shit getting bought up. Institutional money coming.

I am seeing this all over the subs today.  All you have to do is read the first couple pages.  The bulk are examples of the scams that deregulation is causing.  People would rather go read and spread misinformation than take 5 minutes to read something that could be alter their future personal wealth.   And they wonder why there are getting taken advantage of.  They would rather listen to some halfwit on twitter than the SEC and their plan to regulate the space.
Go figure.

It's crazy.  Best piece of news we could have gotten in this mess.  Folks went nuts when they thought VIBE coin was gonna be in an ad for the superbowl.  But yet.......well, you know. 
All this tells me is that this is orchestrated and a vehicle for institutional money to come in.  They already knew the report and probably help guide it.  The crash is well timed for investment firms to enter at better fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:15:26
Why do you hate money?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:17:03
Bullish because this will enable regulation which is necessary for institutional money to enter the space and Wall St knows this and is orchestrating an accumulation and entry point for said institutional money into the crypto space at a price point that more along fundamentals and not at the top of a parabolic ATH speculators market.  
What this does do is affirm that this is not a massive ponzi scheme but that there are some bad players taking advantage of market psychology of fast easy money. 
Where the bottom is nobody really knows but those who are exerting control over this are accumulating, we know that.

Actually it’s the bookies selling. Vegas got smashed by the Eagles win.

Not yet.  Nobody knows where this ends.  Gotta be some signs of life first.

Appreciate you sympathy. My savings account and checking account are staying put. I need them to do stuff like pay bills and buy food. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:29:12
Absolutely not.

I am the bank.

If you leveraged yourself, then yes, you are in big fucking trouble right now.  If you invested with this possibility in mind, you are fine.  If you went all in on BCH forks then you deserve what you get.  The housing market did recover.  And if you were ready to snap up bargains on foreclosures you are now sitting very pretty.  
There is opportunity here.
