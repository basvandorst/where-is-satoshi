Define clearly? If everyone could have a gun, the immediate reaction if you saw one wouldn't be to call the police. However, in countries where it is illegal, you'd know the person was a criminal the second you saw the gun, and without asking anyone, you could silently call the police. 
The counter argument would be that you would have to actually call the police, but most criminals don't want to kill you, they just want to threaten you. So if someone has called the police, you just comply until that arrive. 
I don't see how it "clearly gives criminals the upper hand"?

I completely understand that only criminals would have guns if they were illegal, and that they would have just as many as in the US. That was what I was basing it off. 
I think, as you pointed out, the problem with the "illegal guns" model is that police response time can be slow. But then again, most criminals aren't out to kill you for fun, they want something from you (Bitcoins in OP's case). If you just comply, the police will usually get there in time. Then it's a lot of policemen with fancy equipment vs a criminal with a gun. I think you can be pretty sure the police would win.

I would feel very bad calling the police, without knowing if anything illegal was actually being done. I think a lot of people feel the same. Not speaking from experience: but I would think, a gun would be treated a bit more serious if it was illegal than if it was completely?

A few nuclear weapons, could destroy the entire world. A few guns can't.
Nuclear bombing is also a longer process. Shooting someone takes a few seconds. If you're untrained, I doubt you'd have the reaction time, to shoot someone before you died of their bullet. If someone's bombing you, they're almost certainly going to get some back.
