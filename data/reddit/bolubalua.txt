That looks fantastic, do you know anything else about them? I hope they do it right and accept credit cards, and don't charge too much above the market price.

This retarded meme has to end. Or at least rephrase it, for fuck's sake.

Reddit turned into a meme. Learn to read.
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:56:35
How would that work?
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:57:40
That's terrible. I guess everyone is being too optimistic then.
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:12:36
Yeah, big fucking news. Do we really need to read this stupid [meme]( on every fucking single reddit topic? Every wrong analysis gets the same answer "Correlation does not imply causation", and then automatic upvotes. As usual, reddit grabs something of value and turns it into crap.

What is this taxman I hear you guys always mention? Is it an actual person you have to meet and settle with him? Or just a metaphor?

Couldn't you do that with any other box of anything? And put a brick instead?
The problem with Paypal is mostly for virtual things AFAIK. And you would be selling paper or cards.

Dwolla asks me for a valid US number (not everyone lives there ok?).

Are you joking? My problem is that I can't buy bitcoin, anywhere in the internet. I need a solution to that, and there's a lot of people like me out there in the same situation, entire countries are banned from sending international wires, to force them into using their own currencies, so that the government can steal from them through money printing.

FYI, I use dropbox, and I have my files encrypted automatically client-side. Also, I don't give a fuck about Dropbox as a business, but I do care about Bitcoin, that's why I'm reading r/bitcoin.

What % of your taxes goes to roads, and what % goes to wars you supposedly don't support? Or at least that's what Americans and Brits say when they travel and people ask them about the wars. Nobody supports the wars, "the government did that, not us", but there you are, wars everywhere, and people happily paying their taxes. It's like a big corporation, a faceless entity, that fucks you up and you can't even file a complaint. Taxes and governments are out of control.

We just want to let others know that there is a market for this (buy BTC with credit cards). I know you know it, but others don't. I always get surprised faces when I explain that I can't send international wires because it's forbidden where I live. There are many places like that, and there is some serious profit to be made with that.

You can redeem a bitcoin. I have sold some today.
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:15:33
If that's what you think, what the hell are you doing in r/bitcoin?
You can do that (client-side encryption) yourself. Instead, making them accept Bitcoin might help change the world through Bitcoin adoption.

Which are those more secure coins?
