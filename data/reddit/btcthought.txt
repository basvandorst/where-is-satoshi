It highlights the large chance of BTC failure; ultimatley labeling it novel and incomplete.  These weaknesses then being corrected by the significant and actual new virtual currency.  Or, don't buy BTC, wait and watch.  Who knows, maybe that is good advice.  I've gone from being a huge evangelist to more of a skeptic; as it continually falls from month to month.

To quote one of the best Seinfeld episodes...
(Kramer and Newman are playing RISK, the boardgame of world domination on the subway)
Kramer turns to Newman, laughing: "You have nothing."
Newman, "I still have the Ukraine!"
Kramer, scoffing; "The Ukraine is a sitting duck, it is weak."
A Ukranian gentleman to their side overhears Kramer.... 
"YOU THINK THE UKRAINE IS WEAK!  URKAINE IS NOT WEAK, aAAAAAAaa!!"
Then he topples their board onto the ground...

I would refer you up to my highly downvoted comment about the BTC value.  There is a CHANCE the infrastructure can become rich with American Dollars, using the BTC protocol; but pushing the price down through consistent sales, thereby creating a negligible value.  If this happens, the rich get richer :) and we all lose

Hmmm, good critique.  Both the institution of money and religion were started by brilliant seeds of thought, which preceded the institution.  These institutions are based on deeply human components, which are at the very essence of what being civilized means.  
We live in an interesting time, as the aforementioned institutions have been diametrically opposed in the past.  However, as you observed in the above sentiment, with the advent of BTC, a more collaborative approach may be possible.  
There could feasibly be a world where money and ethical precepts could work hand in hand; though we see the antitheses of this today.
This sounds exciting.

@_date: 2014-04-03 05:26:00
You should be phased... it could succeed and you could go broke :)  READ BELOW:
These VC and Angel investors want to reduce the BTC price so that a more stable, manageable price can be adopted. Thereby taking advantage of the protocol, gaining enormous profit; while those holding BTC see it reduce to a negligible value. This process would successfully subvert a massive wealth redistribution, while still taking advantage of the technology.
Someone might counter this saying, HOGWASH! If it gained widespread adoption, correspondingly the market would grow, hence the BTC price would go up. However, I've heard experts state that if a system was fast enough, and BTC was sold automatically (say by an algorithm), then the price could not only be brought down to a very low figure, but manipulated. Huh oh...
Someone smart tell me I'm wrong, please!

@_date: 2014-04-06 08:20:39
Don't you people understand you're weakening BTC?
BTC's problem right now is that user adoption is lagging behind merchant adoption; this is creating a dissolution in BTC merchant profits, as well as the BTC price.  This is why the price has already fallen.  We  don't need users running out buying other cryptos, if this is going to work, we need to expand the BTC user base; thereby balancing the economy and raising price.

@_date: 2014-04-03 04:55:51
This is at the crux of the issue:
IF the BTC price is very low, it cannot help mankind.  It will be privatized, and money will be made on client fees not BTC itself.
On the other hand...
IF the BTC price is very high, it changes the world.  It will be public, and money will be redistributed on a scale never before seen (seeming less likely).
So....   a message to those that talk about price not being important; you are either the millionaire angel investors and venture capitalists, or you are naive.

Damn man, you sound really sensible and peaceful; the antitheses of your moniker.  In truth, the code is strong enough to take the punishments.  The risk however, is that the impediment created by the day trading algorithms equals the percentage of room needed for long term survivability; which is not impossible.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:49:32
Everything hinges on the value.  If it becomes just a cheap protocol, then the only people who will make money are private companies and angel investors with millions of dollars.  The public, us, can't invest in these companies unless we have a minimum  400,000 investment, etc.  For BTC to change the world and redistribute wealth, the value has to rise.  If it falls, we will just see the rich get richer, and the common man less and less empowered.   
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:02:24
Won't I need to refer to others opinions if I am to learn; thereby raising the efficacy of my investment decisions?

I've heard this argument before... the more merchants that use it, and then convert it to dollars, will inevitably drive the price down...

Really, I already did; with the initial response.  Then you repeated yourself.  Instead of going back and forth like two autistic people in a presidential debate, I will introduce a new seed of through for you to mull over:
you don't understand BTC
a very small overall market cap would be enough to completely replace remittances and money transfers... The BTC price would be extremely low, the system would be incredibly fast, with BTC's being automatically sold.
This way, the rich people gain millions of client fees and the average BTC joe sees his fortune reduced.

Good brainstorms: I don't think there is a workable solution to stop this either.  The problem is much worse on Wall street; I was just trying to appeal to some of the people doing it; in hopes they may stop, finding profit in traditional methodology.

US Exchange increases user adoption: BTC price increases. (appx, 3 k after re-stabilization)
Merchants enticed to accept BTC because of expanding user base.
Merchants sell for fiat, temporarily diluting BTC price and Merchant profits. Derivative result, BTC is introduced to even larger user base.
Due to introduction to larger user base, BTC price increases. (8k after re-stabilization)

Are you proposing the price drop occurred because marijuana merchants in Netherlands, Colorado, and Washington are selling BTC?  
If so, then using this as a model, we would have to infer larger scale adoption would drive the price even further down; which would be horrible.
...Also, how come all of their large purchases didn't first prop up the market; which has been steadily declining for months.
Would some economic expert tell me I'm wrong?
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:17:53
It's funny how confident users here in reddit are, yourself included.  You just shrug off huge movements in the BTC price; assuming BTC will continue on, resilient.  Yes, it has proven fairly anti fragile, but how about a little reverence?  Or fear?  A lot of attacks are being placed on BTC, on multiple levels; many of these we will not know about until later.  Conceivably, BTC could still be destroyed, and many would be interested in this outcome.  Your solution is, take a break from checking the BTC price for a few years? LOL
BTC may not make this by itself; it may need our support.  You shouldn't just assume BTC will hop over every hurdle like a freaking jackrabbit

@_date: 2014-03-28 17:05:03
Sure buddy... not a possible scenario.  The VC firms and angel investors make money off of investments, not the BTC price.  Either way, they make money of the protocol's usability; and are actually motivated to bring the price down to a more manageable, less volatile price.  This would increase the protocol utility, and could be achieved through manipulating the market, creating a system where merchants sell immediately.  
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:50:17
You sound mature 
what do you base this critical BTC perspective on?
@_date: 2014-04-03 07:14:23
Okay, here is another slant.  If you are an intelligent member of the BTC community I'd be interested in your response:
This is at the crux of the issue:
IF the BTC price is very low, it cannot help mankind. It will be privatized, and money will be made on client fees not BTC itself.
On the other hand...
IF the BTC price is very high, it changes the world. It will be public, and money will be redistributed on a scale never before seen (seeming less likely).
So.... a message to those that talk about price not being important; you are either the millionaire angel investors and venture capitalists, or you are naive.
@_date: 2014-03-28 08:04:05
Honestly, I think the decline could be due to something else; other than Gox and China...  That it could be being manipulated; so that a low value, which allows for much less volatility, is established.  This would benefit the rich guys, as I said in my earlier post.

How can anyone seriously considering Seasteading exist without a military?? You'll get fucked up quick.
You have to make enough money to privatize a military; Milton Friedman, who is pretty sharp, said 'the military is the only thing that cannot be privatized'. The reasons for this were not completely economic, but also fiduciary.

I don't just want, BTC to be awesome, that is a childish statement.  I do, however, want BTC members to actively promote it, furthering it's future value.  
Different approach's to achieve this may have varying levels of efficacy; which could be determined.  You're approach, of trying to destroy BTC has merit, but can be dangerous.  
I'm offering an alternative; understanding destructive tendencies and countering them.  
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:42:16

maybe you can provide technical development...
maybe you can provide emotional support to those that have lost money to date.
maybe you can provide political assistance, evangelizing the word to influential figures.
maybe you can provide support to the BTC economy by using your BTC's to purchase items; then buying more.
maybe you can get on chat forums, distributing the word to third world countries that would greatly benefit.
maybe there's even more you can do!  but it will take you too; despite BTC's brilliancy and technical genius, it requires people to use it!

Do you have a conference to prepare for every time BTC drops from 1200 to 400? 
I hope your upcoming conference speech is awesome; because your last one was, on the london real show... You were so evangelistic, you convinced me.  
Now, I'm all in; with thousands of others, admittedly feeling some trepidation.
My biggest fear:
These VC and Angel investors want to reduce the BTC price so that a more stable, manageable price can be adopted. Thereby taking advantage of the protocol, gaining enormous profit; while those holding BTC see it reduce to a negligible value. This process would successfully subvert a massive wealth redistribution, while still taking advantage of the technology.
Someone might counter this saying, HOGWASH!  If it gained widespread adoption, correspondingly the market would grow, hence the BTC price would go up.  However, I've heard experts state that if a system was fast enough, and BTC was sold automatically (say by an algorithm), then the price could not only be brought down to a very low figure, but manipulated.  Huh oh, you didn't talk about this was that London Real guy, you should talk about that in Stockholm.
Anyway, hurry up and have your conference in 2014, before the BTC price falls to zero.

@_date: 2014-03-28 18:32:29
In looking at BTC.  At the core of BTC is it's protocol; it's utility.  That is why it has intrinsic value.  VC's and investors would optimize they're profits by focusing on the protocol.  Further, VC's and investors are largely aligned with government interest.  
If the goal is using BTC as a vehicle for wealth redistribution, there are many more hoops to go through.  For everyone thinking VC's and Investors are magic wizards, that are going to touch BTC with a wand and make it worth 10 grand; hahahah, you may have to look at the issue more deeply.

Hopefully there will be stages of early adopters; as the value may continue to rise.  I think you are referring to the innovators, the stage before the early adopters.

I didn't think you would respond to that...  You are in the deep water here sir, mental weakness of any kind is not tolerated.  
I do appreciate your overall sentiment though; congratulations on your path, your passion, and your success!

For those that think this is a sign BTC will perish.
In my opinion this is a very important step in BTC's growth.  Further, the US seems to be approaching it with an enlightened perspective; at least relative to other large economies, China and Russia.
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:10:29
You may have good perspective...  
Then again, you probably bought when it was 1.40 cents :)

@_date: 2014-03-28 08:10:04
possible scary scenario:
market is being manipulated to establish a much lower figure, double digit; in order to reduce volatility; thereby increasing the BTC protocol usability, and increasing private company and angel investor profits.  Sucks to be the average joe, again... :)
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:28:01
you are like that bald dude in the princess bride... relax, stop over-analyzing petty things; then, look to the larger issue.  
in this case, BTC's falling valuation.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:11:09
I agree...  I'm just not quite as faithful as you.  
Watching it slowly decline is strange, counter intuitive; especially seeing all of the publicity and merchant adoption...

Well done; this will be accompanied in mass, by a host of BTC implementation.

Q:  What is the biggest threat to BTC, govt regulation?
@_date: 2014-03-25 05:48:14
Dude, Question:
How can anyone seriously considering Seasteading exist without a military??  You'll get fucked up quick.
You have to make enough money to privatize a military; Milton Friedman, who is pretty sharp, said 'the military is the only thing that cannot be privatized'. The reasons for this were not completely economic, but also fiduciary.
I'd love to engage a meaningful response; as voluntarism has many positive attributes.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:34:13
Good call; you could be right.  
I got 'suckered' in with all that revolutionary tech, change the world; giving access to the common man.  
The only thing it seems like it's doing is making the common man less powerful and more poor; however, as some of these posts mention, time will tell.

@_date: 2014-03-28 18:47:23
even if the overall network is worth half that; it doesn't mean USD profits can't be generated well over the network value.  E.G. charging client fees for the use of BTC

I remember, I remember...  This is a viewpoint of someone who bought in for much less.
You guys don't have the perspective of someone who purchased volumes during the peak time.
We all hope BTC will succeed; if you are not concerned now, is there any point you do get concerned?  If it goes to 100?  Or, possibly 10, will you still be calling people pathetic?

Sorry if this sounds a little callous.  But...
If you don't care about price, you didn't buy anywhere near the peak period; like the people you so kindly label: 'trolls, speculators and idiots'.
You probably have like 100 dollars invested right now, sitting on a huge pile of BTC; to you it's like a game of monopoly.  Funny

I've heard many speculate that massive merchant adoption could actually drive the price down.

devs are working to create applications that add security and ease of use
the perfect storm will happen when a great application is fully embraced by an ecommerce giant, i.e. amazon or ebay.

@_date: 2014-03-12 03:17:40
I agree, devs will create solutions to these issues.
I've never heard the private key concern; that is one aspect that most people take as fundamental to BTC.  Without that security, the protocol doesn't exist.
You fear that it is hackable?  With the advent of quantum computing this may become even more feasible.  
Opponents to this line of thinking testify to Satoshi's genius.  That the white paper predicted and organized such intricacies that it is ascribed an almost Godlike quality.

You vain fools are more concerned with how people see you.  Okay, sure; you are glorious, perfect revolutionaries...  Now, let's start 'doing' and stop this self infatuated masturbation. 
HERE IS WHAT YOU SHOULD ALL BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT: (THAT IS IF YOU WANT BTC TO SUCCEED AND CHANGE THE WORLD, TRULY DEMOCRATIZING IT):
The big money people in the industry are not buying ANY coins... Why?  They don't give a shit about the BTC price going up. For the common man to benefit from this, and not just angel investors and VC's, the actual BTC price needs to rise. However, the community doesn't seem to care... (weird) Or, they are so confident it will go up, they haven't even considered the following scenario. Sad :(
Terrifying BTC realization:
The VC firms and angel investors make money off of investments, not the BTC price. Either way, they make money of the protocol's usability; and are actually motivated to bring the price down to a more manageable, less volatile price. This would increase the protocol utility, and could be achieved through manipulating the market, creating a system where merchants sell immediately.
This would be great for the rich people investing in the protocol (the common man currently cannot, as to be an angel investor or a VC contributor you need to have well over 400,000; if not millions) it would be very bad for the common man; us.

That could be; maybe they are altruistic and beneficent.  I just have everything I own invested (which isn't much, as I am poor), so I'm analyzing all of the possibilities; this is just a theory:
those in power want to manage the populace and avoid a massive wealth redistribution. however, they understand the cannot kill BTC, so they work with a group of wealthy investors and tech minded individuals; to create a systemic momentum.  This momentum leading to the implementation of BTC on a massive scale, where BTC is sold immediately; thereby pushing the price down to a more accessible number, say 40 or 100 dollars...
Conclusion, they 'direct' this new BTC tech to service their own needs, as opposed to letting it work independently in a free market, where, undoubtedly, the general populace would greatly benefit.
Just a theory, nothing concrete; welcome to refutation.

1.  Yes 1 BTC is one BTC; the question is, what is it's relation to fiat.  When you answer that question, you discover the answer to accessibility.  
2.  You're skewing the numbers, talking about percentage of volatility (chuckling).  That is reductionist, and not a productive form of argumentation :)
3.  Have you have never considered the fact that people in power, with interests of their own, would be interested in co-opting BTC?  Have you considered they're worried; and feverishly working to find a way to 'direct' BTC, because it cannot be destroyed?  These people may be dubbed the relative term, 'nefarious' because they're interests are not aligned with the community in general.

As Charles Barkley would say, "Turble.  Turble (terrible)"
@_date: 2014-04-03 07:46:34
or to be more accurate, BTC is math and cannot be repressed...  rather, I mean a situation where I could see potential for the general populace being repressed by BTC's implementation by the powers that be.

What we need is to have the user base exPand...  if it doesn't exPand fast enough to match the rate of merchant adoPtion, huh oh...  Zero

A protocol is like a giant camel toe, shining above you like the sun.
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:46:36
You sound, how should I say this, unconvincing.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:25:08
sorry, 'divisive' issues.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:04:06
I totally agree; what is your idea of 'long term'?
With Moore's law, and the development of technology, shouldn't long term become a smaller time interval?
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:26:05
I agree; and users that move away from BTC are sellouts.
@_date: 2014-03-29 04:55:53
You are awesome; let's shake of the haters!
If the entire community was full of these haters, BTC would fall apart.  They think BTC is math, and for some reason, because of that, strong community support isn't needed.
They blindly believe that good tech will succeed in a free market; sure philosophically that's true, in reality, the market isn't free, BTC is being attacked, and strong community support is a requisite to success....

*crazy is relative; the current paradigm has made the idea of 'liberty' crazy.
*fanatical is necessary to change the current paradigm; do you think bankers will just move to the side in the spirit of altruism.
*how can BTC grow if people are not spreading the word; i promise you jp morgan won't.
You can continue as long as you want...  what are you trying to accomplish?

thanks for the advice, I'm definitely thinking about it with my losses
I just feel like I would regret it too much, being that bitcoin is unlike anything human beings have ever seen.

In the end we live an a ridiculous version of the matrix :)
It's all funny

Hey everybody; here is a story about some dude talking down to a person who wants to build wealth...  This fool says that no one can become rich unless they 'choose the right path' or have 'passion'.  The fool continues to describe his own life and wealth (lol)...  He, having accumulated all of his wealth through hard work and passion on a chosen path. 
Wow, some people are funny; they think they're the movie star of their own world. 
Then...  He asks how his comments are pretentious.... WOW, some people are very deluded; it's almost like the twilight zone (doo, doo, doo, dooooooo)
Prententious (or, YOU)  1.self-important and affected: acting as though more important or special than is warranted, or appearing to have an unrealistically high self-image.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:21:03
So are you saying whales will destroy the economy?  hmmm, i'm unsure about BTC's future; but this doesn't seem a highly probably threat.  
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:08:25
That too, great point!  Again, they don't give a shit about the BTC price going up.  For the common man to benefit from this, and not just angel investors and VC's, the actual BTC price needs to rise.  However, the community doesn't seem to care... (weird)  Or, they are so confident it will go up, they haven't even considered this scenario.  Sad :(
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:46:13
why do you think it is bad to use Bitcoin as an investment vehicle?
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:59:58
all of those markets could be done with a very low BTC price...  
everyone bought the marketing scheme hook line and sinker.... 
it will make the protocol more valuable, but it doesn't necessarily need to correlate with a high BTC price...
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:51:41
True; does that mean we should actively work to destroy it?
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:20:42
This is about as blatant as you can get; we all understand it is satire bro.  The strange thing is; Max has reduced himself to a satirical figure, going through histrionics to get attention...  Rather, than just using his intellect.

BIG NEWS:  If a big merchant adoPts BTC right now, due to downward Pressure, the Price will go to ZERO

It's at the point where college kids are sending emails to one another; but grandparents had never heard of it.  Saying that, that is much further along technologically that the video you posted.

it will be a fascinating time
