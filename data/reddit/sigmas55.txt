the secret key is given to you by the service you are using 2FA to access, for example Bittrex, at the settings page in Bittrex where you enable 2FA, it will show you a bar code &amp; an equivalent secret key to that bar code, and asks you to save them somewhere safe so you can use them if you lose access to ur phone. Bittrex will show you this key when you enable 2FA the first time, and then it is gone.

Now is the time for Satoshi Nakamoto to get back in, knowing that he got billions of dollars in BTC, he should consider revealing his identity and get back in the game to clear out the debate between bitcoin &amp; bitcoin cash, at least to protect his own investment.

When we will see a light version of Core Wallet !! I don't want to download hundreds of Gigabytes just to make a few transfers per month, but also want to use the safest wallet out there to put my money in, which is without a doubt the core wallet.

Thank you Slush, a quick question:
Does bitcoin block mining difficulty decrease or increase as miners get out/in mining process?

That is why you should always have a copy of your QR code (or the equivalent secret key) printed or written somewhere, just in case you lost or changed your phone, you can re-install the app anywhere and submit your QR/secret key for that specific exchange/service in the new phone.
