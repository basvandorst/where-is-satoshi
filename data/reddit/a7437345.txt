Only 1 (one) enhancement is needed: an orderly way to govern bitcoin. For example, select a Parliament every 4 years, that will vote on all important decisions.

For example, let each miner select a small string of text she wants to be included in the block in case her miner finds the winning hash.

Can confirm, all current users can be subdivided into 2 categories: scammers and losers.
They list 1071 loand on their site. About 60% are currently late or defaulted. For the remaining 40%, we can extrapolate and estimate that while they have not defaulted yet, there is 60% probability of future default. So the real default rate stands at 100 - 40*0.4 = 84%.

Well, 95% of my transaction are conducted when vendors website and my wallet are on physically separate computers, so link clicking won't work. And I don't think it's a wise idea to keep your wallet on the same computer as your browser with all the associated malware.    
As to QR codes, it's not very practical to take QR code pictures with my laptop's camera. And 80% of my transactions are to repeat addresses (my own wallets, exchange accounts etc), so I don't need to create new address every time. I know, privacy and all that, but convenience is more important.

No, you couldn't. Because when you buy at $240, it's statistically exactly the same chance that it will go to $230 as to $250. You will be right about direction 50% of the time, but you will lose money to commissions/spread 100% of the time.

RT is just a KGB unit that tries to wash your brain same way as they brainwashed entire Russian population into zombie-like state.     
And concerning freedom of expression, In Russia, hundreds of people are thrown in jail for as much as clicking Like under a Facebook post not fond of Putin.      
Now watch KGB Reddit battalion come into action.

I think what differentiates them is that they are better vetted, bonded and regulated than other exchanges. Many investors won't touch unregulated exchanges with a ten foot pole (and for a good reason, see Mtgox etc.).

There are estimates from $100M to $1.5B lost in MMM disaster, but it was much more cruel, because victims were mainly poor and uneducated, and counted in millions.

I would summarize it as that: upper management fears that tech will disrupt their business in a way that record industry and taxi medallion business has been disrupted. And if they do nothing about it, the board of directors will hold them responsible. They don't know exactly what they need, and they certainly can't understand things like proof of work or distributed consensus. Which opens the door for two kinds of behavior:    
Outside vendors - IBM, Samsung and many newly formed companies, - add words "block" and "chain" to their marketing brochures. They basically want to create a central large database that every bank must use. Up until now that was difficult to sell because there are too many existing protocols and different interests, but now the above mentioned fear could be the catalyst.     
Then there are young bank employees who try to advance their carriers by showing they are the most innovative ones.

Bitcoin has been already 75% early adopted, development practically frozen, and it costs a lot. Much better to invest in a young currency that is still cheap, actively developed and doesn't suffer from governance issues.
