Because I have no way of using said trading engine as I haven't got API setup that works... 
I have no idea how people are trading on that site at the moment, it's a constant struggle for me to even see my account page.

Obviously if I had money on each exchange I would've made some money but alas I've only just started looking at ways to deposit :)
Good job whoever made the money and got bitstamp trading within 1usd/btc!

Can someone tell me what the point of the tamper resistant part is?
I can understand why someone would want an entirely offline wallet... but what's with the tamper proof, hidden private key part? If someone wants to steal the bitcoins, surely they'd just take the wallet itself? 
It's not like you're going to flash it around so people can take pictures of it. If you wanted to show people the public key so they could transfer you bitcoins, you could just have the private key and public key on seperate bits of paper so they could keep the public key paper with them?

I decided to go to my bank and do a SEPA transfer to get some EUR deposited to bitstamp. Pretty inefficient but I didn't want to buy when the price was $370+ and just wanted to get money into an exchange. Buying from bitbargin.co.uk looks ok but I haven't tried it and looks like there's a small premium.
Submitted transfer yesterday so I don't expect it to get into exchange before Wednesday ish so it's not a fast process.
