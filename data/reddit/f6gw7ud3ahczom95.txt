You were reckless, and shit happens. At least you didn't kill anyone, but the idiocy of your behaviour is comparable. That being said, I'd keep investing in crypto as long as you feel that you've learned from your mistakes. Stop telling people you invest in bitcoin or that you have any. Your official story is you lost it all.

Coolest stuff:
Native segwit support means that a ton of businesses and services that are using electrum will now implement segwit. Expect rapid increase in segwit transactions.
You'll be able to time lock a transaction using a command line, which means you can split 1x and 2x coins after the fork, without replay protection. This will be a good option for those who don't have Trezor or Ledger, who are expected to develop a designated tool for the split.

OP doesn't seem to be American. He's probably from some country where 400 euros in profits are considered an amount of money worth mentioning. It's a cultural thing. Americans are keen to share stories about their success and are happy for the others that made profits. In post Soviet countries, there were 3 generations of adults raised in the ideals of communism - you made more money, government will make you share with those who didn't - this was considered fair. It's hard to get out of this screwed up mentality in merely 27 years of post-Soviet history.

Is the mining cartel really the case though? Yesterday the hashing power switched immediately after the difficulty adjustment block was mined. It seemed like it was automatic. And it doesn't seem like the miners are very considerate about the future price prediction based on chain volatility, just a straightforward price Vs difficulty calculation. Seems stupid knowing their mined coins are on hold until 100 blocks are mined. Good luck with 0.5 BTC per BCH keeping up for that long...
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:04:01
I'm not sure about samurai wallet strategy for the fork. If you choose a software wallet, make sure they have a strategy to enable splitting functionality for their users. I would avoid wallet mobile apps. It would be a hassle to retrieve your private key if they end up not supporting a split functionality. If I had to guess, electrum 3.0 - lightweight wallet for PC - will have the biggest community support to develop a splitting solution. Electrum implemented a timelock functionality in the newest version, which means you will be able to split the coin by utilising different chain lengths of 1x and 2x coins after the fork. I doubt it will be user friendly though (some console commands may be required).
Easiest and safest bet is still a hardware wallet.

Actually trustee is still considering this. All claims are made in fiat (JPY), but it's still possible they may agree to return coin equivalent of some claims. 
But in my personal view, you're probably right, and they'll end up distributing fiat. It's hard to imagine trustee agreeing to bitcoin distribution. It would mean more chaos with picking exchange rate for payouts that everyone agrees to, and more chaos is the last thing trustee want. 
Hopefully next time they will go for auction or OTC to sell the rest of the coins, and not do a market dump.

It's an aggressive altcoin. Intended to source its value from adoption that bitcoin developers worked for. Bcash and b2x will have a spike in volume for several months due to people trying to figure out what do with this coin they were suddenly gifted, but it will die out eventually and get abandoned when people realise they are losing money by keeping their funds invested in these altcoins instead of the original bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-05 14:08:54
That's a new coin that will split off of Bitcoin blockchain some time in November. It will be incompatible with most of existing infrastructure built around bitcoin (merchants, exchanges), doesn't have developer's support (except for one developer called Garzik) which is why it will be treated like every other altcoin, and slowly fade into non existence. The bright side is that if you own bitcoin, you will automatically receive equivalent number of the segwit2x on the day of the split. If you are fast enough to move it to the exchange, and sell it for Bitcoin before the price drops completely, you can make some Bitcoin out of it :)

He probably thinks he's right. With the kind of money that he made by simply buying early, his ego must be through the roof. He thinks that his "audit" is legitimate and decides to lure more users into the exchange (remember, because of the Mtgox insolvency fears -2-3 weeks delays in fiat withdrawals- the price of bitcoin was 10-12% higher on Mtgox compared to other exchanges). 
We now know that when he was saying that, most of Mtgox bitcoins were already gone.

FT recently had a piece on Chinese exchanges artificially generating volume by trading among their internal accounts. OK coin was one of them.
Volume on the exchanges means nothing, because it costs nothing to fake it. It's not ethical, but exchanges have a strong incentive to do so, to appear to be main players on the market and attract customers.

They will still use the POW, but the work will be done by them only. Same with nodes-limited to banks.
This is no danger to bitcoin of course. Bitcoin is open and is a great platform for development of the technology, that they can benefit from for free. It would be stupid to try to limit it by regulation (not to mention it wouldn't be possible).

Don't tell him. In fact, don't even encourage any of your family members to invest in bitcoin. They can make a lot, but they can lose a shit load as well. If they're not savvy enough to figure out how bitcoin exchanges work, they won't be smart enough to store their bitcoin safely and to hodl when shit hits the fan.

@_date: 2017-10-14 17:28:04
The only difference between an altcoin and bitcoin cash / b2x is that coins created through chain split actually have people wanting to transact with it from day one. Mostly selling. The volume creates an illusion that the coin is popular, and some investors start to speculate on its growth keeping the price relatively high for an altcoin.
Now that we know that fork coins do not actually have any impact on the price of bitcoin, we should create them more often to benefit from the small bump in bitcoin holdings every now and then. This also has a cleansing effect on bitcoin hodlers community - stupid people buy the altcoin and don't get rich/influential.

@_date: 2017-10-01 12:00:07
They are making coins with every block mined. Miners can't HODL it, because they have to pay for electricity in fiat. These new bitcoin cash coins will be dropped on the market sooner or later, and since there is not enough people buying, the price will drop. They don't even have to put these coins on exchange to drop the price, because investors are already anticipating price drop, and they sell their coins before miners, for a better price.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:39:46
Yeah, I mean, the story is about an attacker splitting the chain, effectively copying every coin in existence at the time of the fork into the hostile chain. The new, hostile coin should not be considered valuable, because it has no intrinsic value at the time of split (thin air). Now what's surprising is that people are willing to pay money for the copy-coin, even though all they have to back up its price is a believe that the alternative version of the blockchain has greater future than the original -because, let's be honest, at day zero the merchant acceptance of the new coin is near zero and there are hardly any exchanges dealing with it. The value at day zero is fully speculative.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:47:23
Even bigger, because they're not B2X futures :)
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:35:05
"Creating value our of thin air" actually happened with bitcoin cash, and is showing again with s2x token trading on bitfinex. It just proves that markets are irrational. Such airdrop forks may continue until investors learn that the value added of such fork is actually ZERO, and learn how to price it adequately.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:24:18
Well that's obviously an exaggeration to say "from thin air". The reality is they are still able to make money off of stupid people, who don't fully grasp Bitcoin, and probably think BCash and S2X are great investments.

@_date: 2017-10-31 17:45:43
Is there anything other than bitcoin cash that I should have split?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:38:05
That's a reasonable stance.
Although they didn't think through their Bcash approach. They essentially credited users who held their bitcoins on Kraken with equal amount of bcash from day one, enabled bcash withdrawals and trading for bitcoin, but didn't allow bcash deposits. With a very limited supply of bcash, and unlimited buy side, they allowed the price to increase artificially, which was bad for price discovery worldwide. 
They should allow s2x deposits from day one. If not, do not enable trading, because you're creating a fictional price.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:31:11
Some exchange that didn't distribute after the fork is probably merging bitcoin cash from multiple user wallets to get rid of it before its price drops any further (it's only 6% of bitcoin now, still dropping). Big BCH sell out to follow.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:27:36
Dude I avoid talking to my family about bitcoin or any other investment for they matter. No matter how much money they could make, they can also lose it all and your relationship with them will never be the same. It's not worth it, trust me.   
You can tell your friends though, who gives a shit. You can find new ones when the shit hits the fan.
