Yeah I eventually broke down and bought rounds from bulkammo.com with the card since I couldn't find a better deal or same deal with bitcoins on those sites.

clearly in the video it shows that you have to enter the address manually which means you would have to contact whatever site and tell them you overpaid and provide them with a receiving address.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:52:55
depends how the site is set up and asks for your email or requires an account. if it doesn't then it's up to the buyer to email the seller otherwise how else is the seller gonna know who bought when?

good exit strategy, I say we all open exchanges in new york get a license and then few months down the road tell everyone we are getting rid of new york and they have a set date to withdraw their bitcoins because we all know they are gonna end up with a nice bunch of leftover coins from people who don't read the news or stored them their for longterm holding and of course it's all legal as long as we give them a deadline. Brilliant!!!

If he was ever planning on cashing out then when bitcoin was at $1000 I'm sure he would have at that point considering he would have been set for the rest of his life and probably his childrens lives.

not only this but the title is very misleading like it's implying almost every bitcoin address is vulnerable even though it's only about brainwallets which probably make up less than %5 of active wallets if that.

Who is the one on the right who looks like they had a stroke and can't use the left side of his face to smile?
@_date: 2015-07-19 22:55:17
At least someone got a kick out of that, seems everyone else is too anal to accept a joke.
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:53:58
no, no one else has these problems because they are smart enough to use the search function and find out that they have been scamming users for months now. Now stop advertising this shit site.

Agreed paypal has too many fee's for sending any amount of money, when I found out about bitcoin I immediatly withdrew any funds in my paypal and started only accepting bitcoin. I suggest others do the same if they don't wanna go through the same hassles other people have experienced running an online business. It will happen sooner or later it's just a matter of how many times are you gonna let them shaft you before you give up.

I'm sorry sarcasm was never a word you learned.
@_date: 2015-07-19 08:57:08
Considering almost all of them only know how to use a phone for texting and calling, It's no surprise they don't get anything else about technology. I pray for you.
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:24:34
Paypal has always given people problems with bitcoin so it's never an easy task, and why would you ever want paypal over bitcoin? Their fee's are ludicrous they are like the digital mafia with a bunch of rules and regulations included.

Have you used the search function yet? I think not. If you did you will clearly see that the last threads mentioning bitcoinfog state they got scammed and plenty of others agree in the threads even stating why does reddit still have it on some sidebars. Now sorry for your stupidity, move on and mix them yourself or read a good amount of opinions on a site before you choose instead of clicking the first link you see on the internet because some people suggested to use it back in what 2013?
Wow, much results. Past month alone there is literally like 8 threads saying they got scammed out of a whole whopping 10 results. If you haven't gotten the picture by now then I'm just going to assume your someone who profits from idiots depositing into this service.

1A6E seems to be collecting any amount over .0001 and it looks like it's scripted, never spent a dime yet.
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:40:13
You feel like advertising when your hoarding Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-15 06:26:20
I found this site a while ago but never used it before so proceed with caution.

They used a exploit which was leaked to some small hacker forums to reset satoshi's gmx password and then from there they could reset his other accounts I highly doubt his dox is being sold as someone would have leaked it by now for e-fame since that's all those kids were after. 
Around the same time there was also a mail.com exploit which allowed people to reset anyones password.
reference to someone selling the exploits after it was already leaked.

backpage was just featured in this tv show american takedown in the episode of human trafficking, I think visa was getting a lot of complaints from law enforcement because of prostitution and tired of getting subpoenas for customer information in regards to backpage.
link to it for anyone interested: 
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:45:35
I think the reddit community would rather not be bundled with the stupidity of people not using the search function, so your argument is invalid.
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:53:26
Where's her ad? ;)
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:40:31
And yet idiots are still continuing to use this service.
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:57:16
don't register to the site below with the same user/email and pass or you might not have any btc to withdraw.
@_date: 2015-10-17 19:18:22
Thank you, I was just looking for a changelog or something on their website but didn't find one which is surprising.
@_date: 2015-10-23 17:31:36
or at the bank.
@_date: 2015-10-25 01:54:30
I can just see this ending bad for so many noobs or just peoples common mistakes, if anything some kind of password to overide the timelock or maybe a phrase or seed.
@_date: 2015-10-25 01:43:09
Sounds way too good to be true, a well worded writeup and halfassed site asking for cheap investments just isn't my cup of tea.
