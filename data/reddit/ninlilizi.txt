The awkward moment Bitcoin takes you to the moon before Star Citizen.

And now you've posted that on the internet you'll never be able to use it O.o

At least it's a sign they're actually mining in there.

I tried on friday night.
It sat on 'pending' till this morning when it changed to 'failed'.
Sent a support ticket to ask whats up.

Hey. Wouldn't surprise me. 
Good thing I live off grid with no bills or accounts in my name anyone could mess up and my debit card is as a named second person on a shared account. Don't think in that situation a passport scan can do anyone any damage? 
I just ask out  of curiosity because I have little clue outside of how these things work. Beyond of having to yet find a way of buying BTC direct that'll do business me. Mt. Gox were the only people not to care and roll over from just asking nicely. 
It seems a strange flaw in BTC that for a currency designed for using outside the system. You have to be super plugged in, as in paying bills and utilities and accounts all in one place to buy or sell with fiat. 
Gonna sit with fingers crossed to eventually hear back from Circle worth favorable results.

I LOVE Mead... It's the only alcohol I can drink that doesn't make me call a paramedic ill.
It's also a pain because it's hard to find and only 2 suppliers which are pretty much family run breweries that produce it the traditional way without any toxic chemicals in my country.
Why am I not a customer? Because I live on a different continent.
Am surprised you even have Mead over there. Thought it was only a popular drink in the none Western; European countries. Maybe that's your problem? Selling a niche product with limited customer base, confined to the relatively small geographic footprint of your own country. Bitcoin is also still pretty niche on a number of users vs everyone else. So the intersection of these two demographics is going to be small.
It's great to see adoption by progressive buisinesses the world over. The tipping point is enough of your offering it as an option to few customers and not getting discouraged and quiting before critical mass can be achived.

Per MH, I'm getting just over $0.30/day ... With maintenence at $0.08 per MH. Looking at todays figures $0.37/mh
That's using their Zenpool.
I'm interested in this. Because I live in a place where I don't have predictable or reliable access to electricity. And a limited power budget when I do. Which makes home mining impractical.
So for me it's less about making a profit. And more a way of being able to enter the crypto game at all.

I do have very definite digestive issues. Never been tested for celiac because that's never put me in an ambulance. But wheat products do cause enough discomfort to mostly avoid getting too close to them.
Avoiding whey is a nightmare. Because it's added as a bulking agent and filler to practically everything over here. Sometimes I eat it by mistake. One time had a serious enough reaction to end up in a hospital and get checked out to see what was going on. Eating it first results in feeling exactly like I've just had a morphine shot (Was in a traffic accident once. Not a recreational drug user) Which after the head swimming and nausea begins to pass progresses into cramp like pains everywhere, which continue for hours. On the spectrum of discomfort to feel like I'm dying. It's right up there.
It's entirely possible for funky digestion to be making stuff worse and letting all sorts of not properly broken down things through. 
The NHS is a big rubbish and inconsistent in someways. You can't just roll up to your Doctor and get tested for much of anything. You can try but success is like a weird lottery based on unknown variables. But if you end up in A&amp;E looking like your dying of something unidentifiable, then they'll run the tests for anything they have the facility for. 
Cutting dairy and wheat out of my diet has made a big improvement to my life. Mental symptoms as well. But now I'm free of them, consumption results in a much more severe reaction then before I'd figured it out and was round the clock tripping balls instead.
I realise that a wikipedia page is unrealibe as a source of anything even when its not an article stating things as unreilable theories. But it's 3am and my googleFu failing me right now.
I've started hanging out with the amateur molecular engineers (Biohackers) at my local Hackerspace and have been learning from them the basics of molecular biology with a view to being able to take my own samples and start testing myself for all the known genetic markers so I can get a better understanding beyond the basics whats really going on with me. Hopefully this would be useful to all the others I know with the same issues too.

There are still loads of unanswered questions re how it all works out behind the scenes.
I have some MH's of their scrypt hashlets. Am getting daily payouts, and it looks like the maintenance fee is decreasing slightly each day too.
Not had any stability issues with the web site or payouts. Or all looks shiny and good.
But, then. Who knows. Things could always go wrong. I invested a small amount I don't mind loosing. Curious to see how this plays out.

Congenital metabolic issues.
Basically anything made from grains is a big problem. Quater a pink of beer or lager is enough to result in several hours of unconsciousness. I learnt this the hard way. Wines cause a different problem where I just end up too faint to stand and unable to breath properly after just a couple of mouthfuls.
Ontop of this Schizophrenia, so most of the spirits I can tolerate make the voices much worse.
Sugar based alcohols. Like Mead and good quality rum. Don't cause me any distress. Rum gets me drunk.... Mead however makes me feel very happy and hyper. Allowing for the fact that my threshold to unable to walk without someone to hold onto being about half a mug.
Beyond alcohol, I have a problem with glutan tolerance and completely unable to metabolise cassein (a protein in milk/whey) which my body converts into an opiate intead. A lot of common additives in processed food cause me problems.
Aside from the mental health problem. All these intolerances and backwards metabolic processes are quite common in people from my ethnic background (Rromani), actually most the women I know have all the same problems with stuff.

Provided you've previously replaced the stock recovery image with CWM. Which is hopefully the first thing you do when getting a new device. You can just adb shell, scp, etc from the terminal the same as interacting with the remote filesystem on a server.
Otherwise you have a much bigger problem that's going to require some actual technical skills to fix.

Then your now screwed either way.
As soon as they find encrypted data they will demand the keys.
If the keys are then not immediately supplied you will also be charged for non-disclosure of the requested keys. Any crypto that is encountered by laws enforcement in the UK is then escalated to a case of National Security. This carries a mandatory, non-negotiable jail term. And the police will then do everything in their power to use this as evidence of guilt to your original charge.
There have already been cases of this being used to jail people for otherwise non-issue incidents like trolling.
Welcome to the British judicial system. Where 'privacy' is synonymous with criminal intent.

It's not a subscription.
It's a one time purchase cost.
Then a daily maintenance fee is deducted from the days earnings.
You should receive an email with an activation code which you can then use to sign up on the ZenMiner site. Which is where you can then manage your account.

I had that problem.
I emailed support who said I'd tripped their fraud detection system. Please supply a copy of passport and proof of address before they'll allow a transaction to go thru.
Emailed them dox this morning. No reply yet.... Nearly end of business day now, so gonna cross my fingers they get to it tomorrow.

Trying to remember the process I took now.
I know it wasn't the standard add your bank details and stuff way. But fiddling around found a way to add my debit card without having to link my financial details. Then first attempt at funding the account failed, submitted a support ticket. They asked for passport. Then that was it. Worked perfect since... Able to send money to and from my UK HSBC Visa Debit instantly.
Did I just get lucky?
Circle is currently my only way of accessing bitcoins. The only exchange that were willing to accept me as a customer before was Mt.Gox, that drama exploded literally 2 days after spending months trying to procure the documentation they wanted to verify me.

No BTC incoming... I'm calling it as a trollpost.
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:43:14
I'd be more surprised if there wasn't already.
It's prob one of the first things a troll with too much free time would think of.
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:33:27
I buy all my kit from Overclockers.co.uk  
They also accept BTC.
Not the cheapest, but their customer service is worth the premium alone.

Works perfectly, but had to open a support case to get the account setup and verified semi-manually.

There's literally an entire generation of Apple customers at this point who've never lived in a time where Apple didn't tell them where to drive.

Firstly, we pay more per unit of electricity than a large chunk of the planet. Secondly the cost of energy is largely now at the behest of a French company, which will make that situation dramatically worse in a post-brexit hellscape.
Secondly, recent events are asking the question if they're already struggling to keep power flowing here, before any major logistical upheaval takes a huge shit on the already borderline infrastructure.
Where we're going... The only marginalised and barely used system of exchange that's going to get a lot more popular is physical cash. Because it doesn't need predictable access to electricity for businesses or consumers. I won't even start on the crippling of internet based infrastructure in such a scenario, given international peering agreements, and the legal no-mans land of even exchanging data would threaten the ability to connect to anything in a nobody at the helm can even tell you exactly what or when at this point.

People on a limited income that can only afford to buy 1 part a month?
Which I guess would be most people. As £300-£500/month is certainly the limit of how much I can afford to loose out of my disposable income. And I consider myself to have a pretty average income with a net £20k a to play with.

Dunno, mind I'm presently stuck with a crappy GTX1060 that is just uncomfortably underpowered for my needs. But GPU shortage, so I'm glad I have at least that.
My only experience of an APU was in a laptop a decade ago, and it was a pretty depressing experience. Have they comparitively improved since then?
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:40:39
A part at a time continous update cycle has always served me well over the last few decades.

Except 1050's and the xBones APU are god awful, and frankly. If you've spent months building a highend pc. Relegating it to console level performance just defeats the whole purpose.
It would be like buying a supercar. But then replacing the engine with one from a lawn mower.

Some countries border guards expect you to show up with enough physical local currency to support you during your stay. Or you could get bounced on arrival.
Ignoring the massive load of autism in this 3rd party whinge I randomly stumbled upon a while back. It is the sort of thing you may need to be prepared to deal with. 
May be worth searching to see if you can any such other reports regarding countries you may be planning on visiting if your serious about doing this.
