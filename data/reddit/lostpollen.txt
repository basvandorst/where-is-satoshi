You have cherry picked data and going back to 2013 would paint an entirely different story!

But when it was going down and you have 40 coins you're seeing your bank balance very quickly dwindle and it is a nerve racking experience. "its not your money unless you sell" well if you have 40 BTC and they're worth Jack shit, they're still worth Jack shit
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:54:30
It's so stupid. OP admits his a newbie which probably means he has less than 0.1 BTC so a price swing of 20% is only $200 try keeping came and saying hodl with 10.

Those recent "dips" were short corrections in a strong bull market. Bitcoin went from 1300 to 300 in 2013 and stayed there for 2 years.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:46:19
You got any studies to back any of these claims up?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:54:46
100% op should read the richest man in babylon and read the money moustache

I can't remember the exact terms but i'll explain.
the hanging stick is the lowest price sold in the time period.
the wick or the stick above is the highest in the time period
if the candle is red it means price has decreased in the time period
if green price has increased
the top and bottom of the thick part are the opening and closing prices of the time period obviously if red it means the top is opening price and bottom is closing and if green bottom is opening top is closing
the lines at the very bottom of the chart are trading volume, so the amount of bitcoins traded in the period

You're an idiot mate. Stop posting shit
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:11:17
I 100% agree with everything that  you said
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:23:06
Isn't it just. It's hilarious seeing the recent buyers and their posts mentioning buying dips etc. But in actual fact when it's a longer bull trend it turns into a run for the hills mentality.

"slow upward push"
More like a giant speeding rocket
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:22:17
Haha yeh me too
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:13:52
Haha your stupid! (I'm your parents)
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:28:18
The proof is in the post!

Surely the best investment opportunity/risk ratio would be a shit tonne of lottery tickets?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:48:47
You haven't a clue mate.
Dollar fucking cost average over 5 years. Thank me later!!

It's not funny and obfuscates meaningful discussion

Where do you think the price will be in 6 months?
Personally I would say a slow bleed to 2k-3k bleed and then who knows.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:13:10
past results don't predict future performance
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:54:00
Which is?
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:29:30
Doesn't mean it's not overbought though. Even if it was perfect with zero technical limitations 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:16:42
Any chance you could give me an example of this fake news? So I'm aware of it 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:30:59
What is "fake" FUD?

How much did you buy?

I want to read this essay as well
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:16:30
You're a deluded fool 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:16:40
Just  like the 2000 others 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:33:52
This could easily be the beginning of a long term dip. The last mad rush was followed by a 3 years of stagnation
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:07:37
Agreed. Op needs to only have one entry for 2017
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:24:04
amen to that
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:54:02
That's because it was pretty boring to look at over those 2 years ahah

You’re a bit quick to assume it’s not a bear market 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:26:03
A massive move like this liquidates a shit tonne of shorts at mex and finex. Big players pump the price and liquidation is the fuel that launmches the rocket. it will be sub 7k by the end of the week
