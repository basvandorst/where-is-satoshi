Agree - but that's true with every machine connected to the Internet. Even a "clean" Virtual Machine.

Bad news. If Bitcoin is now "personified" by this man, they are going to go after him, try to make him the Steve Jobs of money and try to debunk Bitcoin is this guy smoked pot once in high school

Is there a rational reason for that (i.e. a TrueCrypt volume using a 256 bit encryption can be decrypted by brute force in X hours) or is that just Dropbox hate ?

Was there today. The only upside was to meet other bitcoin enthusiasts. Other than that, it was a bit sad:
- Not that many people (maybe 200-300 ?)
- Pretty low energy and enthusiasm during the conferences
- The exhibition floor wasn't really showing anything interesting. It was "basic" for bitcoin practitioners , and I don't think they were many n00bs there. However, it was nice to talk to a few vendors.
I was missing fresh ideas, cool startups, energetic speakers, dreams...

Why is the Avatrade BTC price $10-20 below all other exchanges ?

Can someone tell me how secure my setup is ? 
- I have created a small 10Mb volume with TrueCrypt
- I store my multibit.wallet file in this volume
- Before I launch Multibit, I mount this volume
- This encrypted volume is in my Dropbox folder
(I use a Mac but I believe it would be the same under Windows and Linux)
