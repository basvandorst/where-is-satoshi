it's fake news because James Altrucher is an online scam artist looking for attention.
the online morons think he's smart when really he's just a scammer

IMO James Altrucher is just trying to get more attention to sell his "entrepreneur bullshit"
these fucking entrepreneurs are preying on dumb people on the internet and getting them to like them so people buy shit that they don't need. Altrucher is one of the worst. He's always advertising his bullshit spiel on Facebook and other sites to try to lure people into buying stupid shit through his email newsletters and other bullshit methods. it's pathetic. The whole entrepreneur movement is fucking pathetic IMO .... in the past real entrepreneurs didn't act like scam artists... they just went out and created or started something that had REAL WORLD value, not some online bullshit. They're like fucking fortune tellers IMO

I get what you're saying...I'm not saying your wrong but I am saying that NONE of those places wants a nuclear war. It's not good for their economy, it's not good for their people, it's not good for their quality of living, it's not good for the health, and it's not good for their families. Everyone will be scared, and everyone will be panicking. I'm not saying it can't happen, I'm just saying that the last time the dark powers of the world tried fucking with America, we dropped a nuclear bomb on a Japanese city that wiped out the city and hurt generations of good Japanese citizens that hand NOTHING to do with the war. The powers that be, in these countries, don't want war. They just want to be in power and control and have the wealth and status that goes along with all of that power and control. It is kind of a scary situation in the US and NK because both leaders seem like lunatics right now but I can assure you that the rest of the world knows what kind of arsenal each other have and it's not in everyone's best interest to start dropping HBombs all over the place because the whole world will be a mess in every way. I think people are trying to pull at your "fear strings" and it's working because we're talking about it a lot .... but I don't think it's really going to happen. It sure is scary to think about though.... so I feel what you're saying. Respect

It does seem odd that it's going up a week after the china news AND the press posting articles of a lot of so called "financial experts" saying it's a fraud, worthless, or worth a fraction of the price.
It's almost like this news doesn't matter to the bitcoin community... and to that I say, we are AWESOME

MORE- I usually purchase 1 or MORE Bitcoin each buy

I think it will be down for awhile but will come back when the power is back up. I don't see the whole world blowing up or all internet being gone forever. Nations won't let one madman do that to the rest of the world. NK needs the rest of the world more than you'd think.

I own the Ledger and it's super easy to use IMO
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:07:24
no way..... we have Ethereum, Ripple, NEO, Dash, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, ZCash, a million other alt coins....etc.....
the list goes on and on
Most of them will fail miserably, but bitcoin will survive along with most of the ones I posted above, IMHO

@_date: 2017-09-24 15:32:30
