Liquidity may be the main problem but I believe it is increasing day by day.
Personally I recommend Waves DEX and fully decentralized Bisq for multiple main assests like Btc, Xmr, Ltc and surely Eeth. No KYC at all. No special skillls to use the UI. You exchange in your wallet with better rates than instant exchangers like changelly or even exodus wallet. 
There are lots of DEXs based on ETH . If you wanna hold stable coins like DAI, TrueUSD, etc on your local wallet they are a fine alternative at bear market. 
Anyway I believe decentralization is the future.

print it to a paper wallet and give it in an envelope... it will look fine :)
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:40:25
paper wallets should be enough to be safe for many people.

I hate apps that require permissions which should not be needed by the app.
For android, this app asks for
4-Wifi info
5-Device ID and call records
6-Others :data from internet

your post has been removed but I wanna answer you anyway. 
what I understand as a user not coder is as follows:
1-ID :I dont wanna give my ID, email to a pool of users in an app database.
2-Location: I dont care about smoothess. I hate when an app know where I am. 
3-Photos/media/files : no irrelevant app should read my photos folders. (period)
4-Wifi info : no app should be able to read my wifi names and maybe passes.
5-Device ID : than may be acceptable but I dont know if it includes any email or similar. only alphanumeric ID of phone may be used.
call records: no irrelevant app should read my calls. (period)
6-Others : data from internet:  that is acceptable. but I didnt see this at many apps . 
so these are my thoughts. 
that's my support to a developer from a paranoia user :)

I believe they just want to be called as a company that is using bitcoins. nothing more. bitcoin is a rival for such companies.

just use  (afflink) I will be glad if you sign up with this link.
paypal, credit cart to SLL and then SLL to Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:55:09
But it works, the rates are not good but it works. It enables from paypal, credit card or skrill to bitcoin easily.  Actually it is an Austrian company.
@_date: 2015-04-30 10:21:24
just dont! In the end they will go away with hell of coins. There is no logical way  to double your money in 100 hours...
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:33:03
verification sucks, even at those days...
@_date: 2015-03-08 19:15:00
you should just say "don't gamble" . what is it about bitcoin?  anyone can add "don't gamble with USD or EUR". Also anybody can say "I will withdraw my money from bank and keep it in a safe so that I wont gamble".  
your point is not related to bitcoins....
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:28:06
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:34:35
Mate, its not related. Don't be a demagogue. We should accept Bitcoin is a currency and gambling is a bad habit in all ways...
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:35:14
lets say online gambling is the problem. I believe its not a big deal to gamble online underaged. I guess bitcoin is not the one to blame here.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:47:11
not really :)
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:48:00
Would you please tell to the ones who do not know. 
How can they take tusd, usdc or gusd tokens in your local wallet? The only thing it comes to my mind if the company goes bankrupt they may become worthless.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:55:31
Probably your coins are related to gambling or betting. I have heard incidents like that. 
But I have to add, this is the reason why I love DEX and stable coins...  nobody can take away your coins...  I hope you get them back..
