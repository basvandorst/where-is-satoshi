I agree completely. Fuck prison time more though.

So, after reading, it's my understanding that regular transactors of bitcoin are safe. If you follow the exchanges AML laws and don't enter falsified information, you should be fine. 
It's basically requiring that anyone running a business, or issuing a currency utilizing bitcoin must disclose their financial information. 
Bitcoin was never anonymous. If we're ever going to get the respect bitcoin deserves in the business world, we need to have some sort of compliance and accountability.

It still sucks that we have to police Bitcoin.com. I guarantee Roger will try something else to defraud customers. He’s a petty bitch.

Sounds like the Federal Reserve.

Just playing devils advocate here, but what about Bitcoin Gold, BitcoinDark, Bitcoin Plus, Bitcoin Red, Bitcoin Fast, BitcoinZ, and Bitcore? Is it because of Bcash’s backing or price?

Anyone remember back when this title was a joke?

Someone should strike up a proposal with France, maybe a checkerboard orange and blue in our top right corner from the bottom left of the EU flag. Off for the night. GL

Yeah breadwallet creates a new address each time you send to the receiving address. You could send your coins in breadwallet to an exchange, then go to settings in breadwallet and click start/recover new wallet. It will generate a new wallet for you. Then send the coins on the exchange back to your new breadwallet.

Let rainbow through. It's a waste of tiles. Hold the line from France inside our borders.
@_date: 2017-04-02 03:57:27
I'm on it.
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:52:11
I like the idea, but Spoon is right. The other side of the rainbow will take out six tiles vertically from our top right.
@_date: 2017-04-26 22:18:23
Is this just for antminers or all?
@_date: 2017-04-26 22:20:15
Phew. Thanks
@_date: 2017-04-02 03:08:27
True. Will do.

We don't need expansion, our logo looks like dog shit. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:22:11
I changed back to the original to stop fighting eachother. Didn't think the corners were intentional. Just looks weird.
EDIT: changing back. On script 3 now.
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:43:03
BU trying but failing to add "Unlimited" to the end of our hard work and dedication. Oh the irony.

France goes to bed. Bitcoin doesn't.

yeah, we gotta remake his foot. He helped us gain the right side.

We're being attacked from above by France. Caution to SegWit'ers
EDIT: also by a swastika on the left.

This [script]( should fix the white corners of the b, c, and n. All credit still goes to mrchaddavis.

I blame Garza.

The private keys were kept with the CSO. There's no excuse as to why an exchange would not be using multi-sig for their hot wallets.

I feel as though a large part of he rise can be attributed to China's inflated housing market. As well as Australia. Should be similar to the 07-08 US housing crash but likely worse globally. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:02:42
They seem to be the only large news organization covering the rise. They've put out a couple articles since the beginning of the year.

Could just buy and hold if you want to. Could also do signature campaigns on bitcointalk for newly released alts. 
You're not gonna find a miner for your price range, nor would it be profitable with that amount of invested.

Satoshi against decentralization? Say it ain't so. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:12:04
Never used genesis-mining before. Hopefully someone with experience with the site can chime in. However most cloud mining is not profitable as far as I am aware and a lot turn out to be scams. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:26:54
I got the same one from a Parsons Dillon - brunetik02021993

Some Cypherpunks are still around. Adam Back, Bram Cohen, and Julian Assange are some of the more well known living ones. RIP Hal Finney.

Love it! Used to stake my alts on a headless laptop.

Anyone have experience with WannaCry? Are wallet backups on external storage devices safe?
