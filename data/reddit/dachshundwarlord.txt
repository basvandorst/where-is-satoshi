Can someone explain to me the reasons why it can store the data of multiple coins but only hold 4 interfaces with interacting with them at a time/have 4-5 apps on it at the same time? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:21:35
Hahaha that’s so good 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:42
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:45:12
But where? Coinbase? The fees kinda kill it =/ 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:55
I get that it doesn't disappear...hmm maybe I am not understand seeds? I mean if it can store the info, why not always have the interfaces available?

can I set up an auto transfer on there? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:41:45
Awesome! I will check it out! 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:06:26
I do :)

If I deposit into GDAX to buy BTC, and not trade, I want to hold, what is the best protocol for keeping it? Should I keep it in GDAX? And if I want to transfer that BTC to an other wallet (like Exodus) do I find my public and private key somewhere after I purchase it? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:41:18
Ty! So if I use bittrex(which I've used) and I don't use a market order, do I just choose a trajectory and hopefully it gets filled that way? For example if i want to buy BTC at X amount but it's Y right now, and I'm guessing it will hit X, then I put X in and hope it hits it? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:59:36
How did you buy the bitcoin anyways? Congrats btw 
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:08:59
Ah such a great answer! Appreciate it !!! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:38:10
I️ could put in my life savings and pop it if you want 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:55:57
Wow good job to whoever it is. They've got some smarts.

Corporations and rich people like trump avoid taxes all the time. Why can’t the normal citizen? :D

My mother died when I was 9 and father died when I was 16. My shitty aunt fucked up my inheritance 3 years ago and I had to write a check for 30k to the IRS. This year I failed to report 5k earnings somewhere I worked as a side job and I had to write a 1600 check. Fuck the IRS. No.

Ur saying its illegal with stocks? Im wondering what the parameters are on that, and how they track that too.

The reason why gluten free is such a thing is because it sounds similar. The population for celiacs disease is super low. But it caught on. Most people don't even know that shit. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:38:01
Exactly. I feel like regulation on this "illegal" trading process would be overlooked a lot. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:25:14
Same 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:48:47
How will you avoid fees? How often will you invest it? 
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:01:32
Gluten doesn't have anything to do with glutinous. FYI. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:20:33
Good boy
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:28:21
Hadn't thought of it that way
