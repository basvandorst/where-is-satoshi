This is a task of next few years (may be a whole century) to make Blockchain efficient :)

Interesting, is it going to be an alternative to coinpip.com?
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:49:09
It looks like coinbase generates new wallet for each session to accept donations, see working example here 
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:36:14
could you explain it more or share a link on this topic? It it possible to do with existing software/services or requires new one?
@_date: 2015-04-03 05:52:16
Where are you? May be there are some places around you that accept Bitcoin. For .28 You can get really huge burger :)))
Checkout a project I am working on:  really hope it could solve your problem.
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:10:32
I've added this place to liqbit.com

I was smart enough to google by this phrase this, no luck. 
Also why Mycelium local trader is better then bitcoin &lt;-&gt; cache exchange? Not familiar with it at all.

Actually Coinmap, Airbitz are data aggregators and does not provide true info. There are so many fake entries. 
Take a look at  - you may be interested as it only provided an option for manual data entry.
@_date: 2015-04-14 03:36:55
Nice! Did you get any discount?
BTW, I've added this place into liqbit.com so people know it.
@_date: 2015-04-09 00:53:13
Awesome! Sent you PM.
@_date: 2015-04-11 04:27:17
nice! what fee do you think is appropriate?
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:13:59
That's great! Good luck!

Spending Bitcoin could save money as there are no transaction fees. Visa/Mastercard or Square take up to 3% of fees. Potentially you can save a hundred bucks when paying with Bitcoin.
Take a look at 
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:53:47
Ha-ha, it happens with me. That's why I decided to build a web directory so people can share their experience of spending bitcoins. My project is in beta, but you are welcome to test: 
I already added this guy into a directory since he knows how to accept Bitcoins ;) 
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:28:59
I have similar idea but for a obtaining driver's license. Several folks who are experienced drivers could take an exam.
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:56:52
Yeah, there are bunch of places that does not in fact accept Bitcoin and this happened to me as well. That's why I decided to build a tool that could help to validate such places. It is in beta, but you are welcome to sign up: 
@_date: 2015-04-12 02:55:17
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:55:01


Interesting, what fee are they going to charge? Currently they charge 3% for card processing.
@_date: 2015-04-08 05:28:14
Thank you for feedback! I am planning to add new features and of course release an app in future. Currently a website is mobile friendly. I am also thinking about coupons/discounts functionality.
If you are interested to receive email updates, please, signup here: 
Or, btw, I am looking for an adviser.
@_date: 2015-04-11 03:18:51
yeah, great idea!
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:10:17
Guys, I love your comments!
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:51:44
What's name of it?
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:38:46
If you find one, let me know by adding this places into liqbit.com.
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:58:36
I am building what you are looking for: liqbit.com - is a place where people can add a business that accept bitcoin. It's not parsing data from the web, so could be more trusted than alternatives. It's in early beta and I welcome you to test it: 
@_date: 2015-04-12 02:54:49
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:15:34
If I tell that it is virtual marketplace, and is an alternative to coinmap and eazibitz - does it help?
@_date: 2015-04-11 03:17:30
I was speaking with some friends whose relatives remained in Donetsk. There is a really a bit problem of using credit cards and banks. They want to send money to their relatives but there are few way to do it - ask someone to carry cash over a border or find a person in Donetsk who can cash out money from card/bank account which usually costs ~10%.
I think bitcoin in Donetsk is not very liquid and I was not able to find anyone who can exchange Bitcoins into cache. If there were exchanges, Bitcoins usage would be more wide spread there.

It's running on Polymer 0.5 and using multiple 3rd party components that are using Polymer 0.5 as well. I was about to start rewriting but then give up because 3rd party components haven't been updated.
Maybe, by the time I will finish an app, Polymer 1.0 is released and I can use Cordova, but right now it looks very unstable.
I have something working already ( and I need to add couple of more features to build it ready for MVP.

They can save at transaction fees up to 3%.
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:44:01
Nice! I've added this place into  Bitcoin directory I am working on.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:53:21
Have you seen my PM? I've sent you a link.
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:36:42
Exactly! There are variety reasons why it happens, e.g. on Yelp.com business owners are setting all checkbox to promote their place. May be the same happens for Coinmap as it aggregates data from the open street maps.
The idea behind my web-app is that users can add a place and check in as in Foursquare to make sure place is still functioning and accept Bitcoin. Right now you can only add a place, but you don't need to fill all the fields about it - you can easily export it from Foursquare or Yelp.
Here is an early MVP that you can use:  I am planning to add more features and would like to get a feedback from users. Would you like to be informed about updates?
@_date: 2015-03-12 02:25:03
e.g. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:59:20
weird, anyway, here is a project url:  - it is an early release an I am planning to add a new features. I need your help to identify goals I need to accomplish to make this product fit the market. Are you willing to help me with that? If so what is the best way to contact you?
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:13:53
iOS as well :) but really, it may be cross platform
@_date: 2015-03-12 01:55:10
Exactly, and I ma trying facilitate this!
@_date: 2015-03-12 02:23:49
The are mostly Bitcoin related businesses.  See 
@_date: 2015-03-12 01:39:30
well, I agree, it is a different use case. I am not buying things like that. But I know some people who only own a Bitcoin, either their salary is in Bitcoin or they bought Bitcoins when it costed $10 and they spend it without any thoughts.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:25:58
This is exactly the problem I had on the east cost. You can try to search in yelp.com and filter by "accepting bitcoin", however, Yelp.com is not always accurate as well.
I am working on the startup that could solve this problem, e.g. foursquare for the bitcoin users. If you are interested to be an early adpoter / beta tester - let me know and I will share a link with you.

Traditional messengers have a lot of disadvantages. They are not really secure, because:
A. You need to authentificate using either your email or phone number.
B. Every time you log are using a specific messenger server tracks your IP.
So if someone is targeting a messenger bound to a specific phone number, or an email address, or an IP address, there are plenty of ways to do it, starting from a remote code execution on a specific device to get unencrypted messages or hacking short message delivery process.
Using bitcoin address space there is no binding to email nor phone occurs. Additionally using Tor no binding to IP address occurs. So it will be much harder to hack such system.

Have you seen my PM? I've sent you a link.
@_date: 2015-03-16 04:39:24
Then if you can find one, you can add a place here: 
Yelp is showing several places in your area, but I am not sure if they really accept Bitcoin:  - so you can try and if some are - you know what to do :)
@_date: 2015-03-10 03:36:30
Nice story! I like it!
I've realised that it is quite hard to find a business/merchant which accepts Bitcoins. There are some data at Yelp.com, but it seems to be not actual. When I called to those, who selected Bitcoin as a payment option, most of them even don't know what Bitcoin is.
I see a solution to solve this problem and to find Bitcoin business around you. I've started working on the web app that allows to share your experience of using Bitcoins with other people including your friends.
I am looking for someone to take a look at this app and help me by providing a feedback to make sure this app fits the market! I do not want to waste my time, but use it for building a product that people really need.
So don't hesitate, make Bitcoin happen! :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:41:41
Sure, will let you know. Going to deliver an MVP at the early March. Also I have in mind multiple ways for further development and would like to discuss it and hear what people need. thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:42:38
Sure, I will let you know and make you a demo as soon as it will be ready! Thank you for your interest.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:15:05
Hey, that's a good point, there are actually many payment solutions or wallets that allows to accept Bitcoins.
However I find a lack of information of finding what businesses accept bitcoins. There is some information on Yelp, however most of the merchants (which has Bitcoin checkbox set) do not even know what Bitcoin is.
So I decided to build a Yelp like service that will share info about trusted merchants that accept Bitcoin. If you are going to switch your town to accept bitcoins, you and folks of your town may be interested in it.
The problem that I am facing now is that I know small amount of people who really payed with a bitcoin in a real life to brick and mortar business and I wish to get their feedback about my app when it will be ready. Do you know any folks like this?
