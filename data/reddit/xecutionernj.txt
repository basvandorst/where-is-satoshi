No, banks didn't try make their own currency because they didn't think about it. 
Look i think crypto currency is a good thing overall. But you can't tell me that its more secure. There are proper regulations that prevent the kind of schemes that are currently rife in the crypto world.
They can't be stopped because of the way the currency is set up.
Crypto should be a way for refugees to take their money out of war zones, pay for online services to avoid geo blocks etc. It should not be an investment because it is a currency. 
If it is any good as a currency it shouldn't be an investment.

But if the dev team is good but nobody actually uses the currency except for traders, then its all a game of getting out before the bubble bursts. 
That's not investing, its speculating.

It is a currency. If your going to use it, buy it. Don't invest, same as cryprocurrency. 
It is a currency not a stock. Its purpose isn't to provide you an investment but a method to purchase goods and services.

Why are you investing in a currency? Would you invest in indian rupee? Then why invest in some cuurency some nerds invented.
Its a currency not an investment. It's just like some dude started printing money ion your street and everybody started train in it. It is worthh what people will pay for it. 
The dev team etc. don't add to the price. It's only what other people are prepared to pay for it. So you have to look at Who is using it, not who is investing in it.
It is a currency.

Pump and dump strategies are as old as currency itself. In a non regulated market the ponzi schemes have free rein.
The fact that HSBC and Deutsche bank launder money is a failure of regulation that we all should be concerned about. 
I agree crypto currency can be secure, but you have to secure it. Tresor, paper keys, deposit boxes etc. A bank does a fair amount of that work for you.
Crypto currency will gain use in poor countries and for international travelers as the fastest and best way to circumvent currency issues. 
If cryptocurrency was around during Zimbabwe's currency crisis, you can bet it would have stabilised the country faster.
At ther minute i just see most people trying to "invest" in something that was not designed as an investment vehicle. The eventual large crash across the market will slow the speed of cryptocurrency being used for its pepper use. Is still revolutionary and will change the world for the better. 
Until that time we just have idiotic investments.

That's where libertarians don't make sense. Market manipulation and ponzi schemes won't be solved by decentralised currencies. As we are seeing now with bitcoin.
