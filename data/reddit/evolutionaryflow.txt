mcafee literally admits to being a shill
notice that Bob's repair ICO hes been pumping a couple days ago saying how he's friends with the team? bobsrepair reached out to him to shill for a fee a couple weeks ago.

what's more likely, john mcafee who proudly admits to shilling for payment  , actually shilling for payment- or some random kid making a "fake" video for no reason?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:56:41
no because it was never tweeted out to masses unlike mcafees pumps, and the small amount of publicity it got on this sub wasn't showing it in a positive light

what can the video taker gain from that video? the only person gaining here is mcafee and the pumped coins
he also completely lies about the coins he pumps- says kwhcoin is the first power trading coin when powerledger has been on the market for more than a few months.

if major countries banned bitcoin and the flow of goods transacted by it through their territories, wouldn't that defunct a big portion of the usefulness of bitcoin, if not other similar cryptos?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:49:49
its possible btc will always find a use in the black market, even if all countries ban it. 7 years is too short of a sample to really know much

Those parts of the economy are compliant with tax policies and not in an adversarial relationships with the government and fiat system of the land it resides in.

theres no inflation within bitcoin, but theres inflation in the overall crypto space with many new competing currencies, like litecoin or nano, taking capital and market share away from bitcoin by people who are looking to use it for liquid utility.
