EOS doesn’t have a blockchain yet, for this example it wouldn’t work. Eth isn’t a pain for me to use it all. If you are using EOS, you are using Eth at this point in time.

Ver is a nut, but he cares about bitcoin, and most importantly to me, he’s marketing it. Bitcoin Core has done little to increase business adoption of Bitcoin, and progress has been at a standstill for years. Personally, I don’t care much about either of them. From a technological standpoint, it’s just not that interesting to me compared to Ethereum.

Try bitflyer US. You can cash out via wire same day, $5 fee I believe. There is no way to sell btc on Cash unless you actually bought the btc on Cash. You can only withdraw, no deposits.

I would argue they should remove Bitcoin and only have Bitcoin Cash, which should be called Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core has failed Bitcoin.

That is total BS. The IRS hasn’t stopped Bitcoin in any way shape or form. I know thousands of US traders and never heard one of them say man, the IRS ruined bitcoin for us. Are you really arguing we shouldn’t have KYC/AML? I couldn’t disagree more.

Definitely check out Bitflyer US. Amazing site for fiat to btc and btc to fiat. The trading interface is killer. Only wire in and out, low fees, same day clearance. Very pleased with it. Verified to 50k a day within 24 hours.

You know it would be a lot easier to just use eth right. Since you can buy alts with eth and it sends very fast and cheap. I do use Bch over btc for transfers too though. But eth is always my default coin.  Mine shitcoin , sell for eth, trade for new coin or hold. Eth is going to continue to far outperform btc, just like it did the last 2 years.

Personally I love Coinbase/gdax, even though they have less coins, they are the most trustworthy exchange we have, and they made it A LOT easier for many to get into crypto. I also appreciate that they play by the rules, or more so than other exchanges (looking at you bittrex). In my experience most of the people who hate on Coinbase are those from the dark web or gamblers who are upset they got their accounts closed for doing illegal crap. Now, back to Cash.. yes you can withdraw btc, I’ve passed verification. What it doesn’t appear you can do is DEPOSIT btc back to the system. That really sucks, the whole reason I wanted Cash was it appeared to be an easy way to sell bitcoin and have the money back in your account the same day. Guess it’s back to good old Gdax and Bitflyer where I can still wire withdrawal, although Gdax recently changed it so the minimum wire withdrawal is 25k, bitflyer however doesn’t have a minimum, but it does have a 50k a day max.
