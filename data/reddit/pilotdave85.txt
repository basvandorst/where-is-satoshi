But Im NOT a Big Block supporter :) I support Core Bitcoin, Download from github for implementation, and Prefer original bitcoin to be original with alts as the secondary currency to make small transactions. Large value transactions stay on the most secure network. 
And I have not lost any bitcoin... ,have at least 2 FULL NODES running at all times,  run my own bitcoin blockexplorer, and several other cryptocurrency nodes. HUC is fun because of the consensus switch. I've played with the old and new wallets... Swept old HUC wallets into the updated chain, etc... But Derp, I dont know shit and am a Big Blocker I guess because you say so.

You are correct, the fee has NOTHING to do with transaction propigation. 
Fee is involved in confirming your transaction in a block, not for propigating it to the other wallets (nodes).  This is where confusion of Full Nodes vs Miners comes in since the original whitepaper includes those as a conjoined, full node.

Bitcoin won't fail (A node will always hold the ledger) but if you mean the price will fail, the price is based on speculation, and yes can drop to 50 cents again, at which point I will purchase as many as possible because it still does the same thing, transfer value peer 2 peer within an hour and the transaction fee would have dropped dramatically by then back to .2%

It's a gamble to hold national currency too, like USD in your savings account, gaining .01% a year... in fact you can Gamble that the USD will be more valuable than the Euro and buy USD and hold it if you are European... Everytime you move money from your pocket to the table, it's a gamble. Bitcoin is just another currency, stronger than most national currencies.
Stuffing Dollars in your matress is a gamble, a gamble that your USD will hold or increase in value... and of course, being the national fiat it is, will be a HORRIBLE gamble for a 30 year term.

Speculation is pure gambling. Any law passed can make your trade go either way. Any disrupt, or new technology, can make your speculation fail, and you gambled and lost. 
If you speculate that Oil will gain against the Dollar, and BP/Shell opens up Gull Island, for example, you will lose a lot of money from your gamble. 
There is no difference between knowing your Outs in a Texas Holdem Game and knowing your outs in an Oil Speculation trade... Except if you fold in Texas Holdem you get nothing back, Zero. 
If gambling is only All or Nothing, then Speculation is the next step above. And holding bitcoin is not gambling unless its All or Nothing, which it definately isn't. 
So if anything buying bitcoin is speculation, not a gamble, and if it's considered a gamble, then so is all speculation... 
Don't forget the check the value of your CDS's your broker convinced you to purchase ;)

Why not have a algorythmic condition to adjust the blocksize based on last 6 blocks, and the miners cannot choose anything bigger... just like how difficulty is adjusted based on hashpower? Why was that never implemented in the beginning from Satoshi? 
Maintaining a 75% blocksize average is not only good for miners (to prevent orphaned blocks, some would complain that they are restricted from manually forcing full blocks, but if the network fills during those blocks they will get 100%) but also gives some play if there happen to be more transactions that fill the blocks. 
Am I missing something or are we all avoiding the most simple, most efficient, and autonomous way of dealing with such a patch? Developers use conditions to control code... 
Why does a developer need to manually adjust the value of the max block size? 
Developers program things to happen with conditions...

Reconsider pruning, and instead, building a block explorer with by parsing the full node into a DB!!!
Pruning technically "weakens" the network, as you do not have a full node and cannot relay transactions or create/access any other wallets, making your node useless to the network and only beneficial to you. 
But if it's a HDD space thing, go for it, though I don't think you need C++ to prune the bitcoin blockchain since, it's coded in. You just run bitcoind with -prune option.

I suggest a basket of many of many alts and always holding at least 1 btc. Alts are really funny/risky and definitely not always positive. But you make YUGE gains when an alt youre holding gets a lot of attention... Could be a bear market for 2 years again, though. HODL!
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:25:37
Correct, its why alts are jumping up too as expected while btc holds solid. We dumped our alts for btc so we could get bcc for free then dump bcc back to our favorite alts. Maybe bcc will be a new favorite alt, maybe it will end up like bitcoin classic...
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:35:34
For both. But currently Alts. BTC may go bear again. Bull markets are short BUT STRONG in crypto.  With alts I go with some top 10 but also some alts that are lightly known, thats where the big gains are and losses are long and strenuous.  I.E.

I agree here, this is not Bitcoin or Coinbase's fault, but government regulation and legacy systems. You know that KYC/AML stuff? Yea it's no joke. So just wait. Now if your funds failed to transfer, like No_drama_llamas then you should contact your bank and query as to why your money didnt go to Coinbase, you might be shocked to find they might have blocked the transfer, not coinbase. So chill, wait, let the old system prepare to accept your transfer and remember why bitcoin actually exists.
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:57:34
The original Bitcoin code was full of issues that have been resolved with UPDATES to prevent major issues. Segwit is another upgrade to prevent major issues rather than a simple blocksize increase which is something Satoshi decided not to control, just limit, for a reason. To prevent spam attacks from locking the network. You know this, I know this, we all know this... And yet the argument continues. Segwit is a smart way to increase network propigation to assist in preventing network lockup. Blocksize can be raised, but that's the simple solution that will affect the majority of the network and will actually us cause "little people's" nodes to be deactivated due to harddrive size requirement increase proportional to the magnitude of the increase of the blocksize. Basically the real Bitcoin devs are trying to keep Bitcoin up with Moores Law to ensure Bitcoin doesn't grow beyond individuals computing capability too fast causing it to move directly into the hands of the rich and corporations who can afford Terrabyte harddrives just for bitcoin blockchain storage. 
Currently you only need 130GB or so to have a full node, and remember, only full nodes count when it comes to consensus and network security.

Only in a centralized government fiat system are taxes required, to pay for the government. When I exchanged my dollar for bitcoin I paid sales tax already and all of the the remaining dollars went back into the American economy to be used again instead of me HODLing dollars... So bitcoin helps keep the flow of dollar in the USA moving more than taxes can all day, but the government wants control of their money flow so they can control the economies. If they understood that, theyd encourage bitcoin savings and gains. Remember, in the current Keynsian system... They must print to keep money flowing and discourage savings which stagnates monetary flow and keysian economics.

They'll also tell you that Mining Full Nodes are not the validators. That POW is just to compile the blocks of transactions... Except that when all of the mining nodes make a decision, if the non-mining full nodes don't follow, then the nonminingnodes no longer having a secure ledger. 
Remind them: All miners are Full Nodes... in Satoshis white paper there was no difference. The Full Node mined. If youre not mining with your full node then you are securing the network by holding the entire ledger, but have no say in POW consensus. If you want to control consensus, you mine the POW consensus algorythm you agree with or thats the most profitable. Miners were the original transactors and still are transacting daily. Ask the POW hater how many times a day they make a transaction on the Bitcoin Blockchain.

Actually Miners are the only ones with power. Miners can mine whatever they want. Users have to use what they're mining. Please go read the Bitcoin white paper. Consensus for validation of new transactions achieved through mining. Users can also mine bitcoin. That's the benefit. You are not submitting to a centralized system. Miners can Mine other SHA256 algos with their miners if they want.

They can use Bank ACH too if they want. Instead of reinventing Bitcoin, Users can use hundreds of other cryptos, and miners can change to any other cryptos too. The only difference is that, the more users on a network does not make it more secure. The more miners on the network actually does make it more secure. So Miners have the power to make a chain secure or not, not Users. Until you take away POW completely, then you don't have Bitcoin anymore. So what do you do?

The steps to run the network are as follows:
1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
2) Each node collects new transactions into a block. 
3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the
chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.
Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on
extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-
of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
branch will then switch to the longer one.
No your full node that is not mining does not run hashing algorythms and is not producing any Proof of Work.
Thanks for the insults. You are a true internet troll. Congrats! You also are very undereducated on bitcoin or misinformed on how it works and the history. I am producing content directly from the whitepaper, you are twisting the words to where the document no longer makes any sense. The only section pertaining to your comments IS section 7 and you are somewhat right, but even there the vulnerability is stated if non-mining full nodes get attacked by mining nodes that want to change the concensus by VALIDATING invalid blocks that would otherwise be orphaned by the network (of miners and then full nodes after a true non attack block was produced).
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:27:47
Miners are required to validate consensus. Your node will verify a fake bitcoin and you will lose your money if you collect if there is a 51% attack on the transaction block by miners. Basics bro.

I guess you don't consider preventing double spending validation... 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:45:00
The reason a 4mb block cannot be produced is that it will not be accepted by the rules of the nodes block verification until the node is updated to accept 4mb blocks. So if the miners update their nodes, they can produce valid 4mb blocks, but they will be on a different chain as you said. The majority of users use the core bitcoin source so it's very unlikely that will change unless core changes it, but if a majority of the miners start mining another bitcoin, the users will have a less secure system and may want to switch to where the majority hashpower is. If the validation attack happens in a 1mb block then it's a 51%. Apples and oranges.

They Validate 51% attacks just fine dont they... only miners can correct that. In fact Full Nodes cannot attack the network or change the rules because they are NOT validating transactions. They are verifying transactions sent are actual transactions with the proper headers. One of the requirements for a block to be accepted is that all the transactions are valid in the block. If the block has invalid transactions OR is already created with those transactions it is orphaned and dropped out of the blockchain. This is why it's important to wait at least 10 minutes to verify a transaction is valid in the blockchain or is a double spend attempt. The miner is responsible grouping transactions into blocks, and validating them between the network of miners. A miner can 51% the network by changing the concensus wuth 51% or greater hashpower by creating a longer chain with a different block and concensus. At this point the network is insecure and can be manipulated and the Full Nodes would agree but note the change, hence Bitcoin being Not Immutable, but mutations being known throughout the network. At this point a fork can happen due to mining or validation activity. And this is why during a fork it is NOT recommended to send transactions until miners are securly hasing the attacked chain as they might get destroyed (from the new chain) as with bitcoin cash vs segwit  or kicked back as an invalid transaction depending on the circumstance.
"At periodic intervals, a new block is generated by one of the “validator” nodes on the network, containing a set of as-yet unconfirmed transactions. Every block has a unique 32-byte identifier called a “hash”, which is determined entirely by the block’s contents. Each block also includes a timestamp and a link to a previous block via its hash, creating a literal “block chain” going back to the very beginning."

Not religious.
But I understand you are caught in semantics. Again, The full nodes verify transactions are properly built and the value is valid in the last block and every block before that. But the miners are validating them by combining them into a block and releasing that to the network, hence preventing a double spend and consensus change. If the Concensus changes, nodes not accepting the new concensus fail until updated.

I know what  node does, And I copied right out of Satoshi White Paper what it does. You didn't.

You are an internet troll. You think Im pro 2x. I am not. You think I am a shitty dev? Equifax has shitty devs... The Core bitcoin developers are aware of how it works too. Maybe you arent. Who cares. I'm done trying to make you understand that if there were NO MINERS on your chain youd be SOL and there will be no future consensus on new transactions.... Luckily this will not happen, because of the incentive (the reward for working the important part of the consensus) is valuable.

First there were miners. Then there were users. The miners decide which blockchain to secure based on which is more profitable to them in Bitcoin, which they then send, usually through several wallets before hitting the market. Users.  Miners also pay for transactions.

Wow... You are dense.
You highlighted a point that REQUIRES blocks created by miners.
Go play with POS dude, because you don't understand POW. 
Not to mention it IS possible for a bad actor to control 51% of the network and validate invalid transactions (double spends) which is the entire point of the mining competition, but not mining in general. Transactions propagate to the network and are verified they meet parameters, but that is not what secures the chain and enforces the timestamping. That's what the mining nodes do. If you spend the amount you had in the last block twice, it won't be known until the next block unless YOU control 51% or more of the hashpower which puts you in control of the network for at least 10 minutes if you found the next block and 51% of the active Miners (which you are running) is confirming the block of transactions to be valid (not double spent).
If Nodes were the validators of the blockchain, this would be easier... All you would have to do is run 51% of the full nodes to attack the network, which doesn't take much... 
Can miners run segwit2x and be on the same node structure? Not without a node update to change the concensus to mine on. That doesn't mean nodes control the network concensus. That means they are required for connecting to the bitcoin blockchain with the most hashpower. The Hashpower can attack 2x if all the 1x miners attack 2x and discredit the chain and force a wallet update on users.
Bitcoin Full Nodes do not control the validation and concensus, they propagate transactions that match the bitcoin protocol... Mining nodes do.

decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested" 
As far as miners choosing what to mine. Yes they mine for profit, paid by the token issued as the reward. That is why Bitcoin is Still Core... Because it is the most secure, least problematic for miners, and is the most profitable of the SHA256 coins and always has been. Transaction fees were also supposed to pay for the entirety of the miners profit by block 6930000... So transaction fees will not be "micropennies" in a block being competed to fill. This is why the idea to allow spam attacks was adopted by big blockers to increase pay to miners through more transactions by increasing the blocksize. More transactions per block, less fee per user, more fee collected by miner. 
The majority of miners stayed where?

Nodes validate the transaction is not a jpeg image. They do not validate a double spend. Miners do that. And thats the purpose of mining. Transaction validation confirmation  is done every 10 minutes roughly. If you accept a large sum of bitcoin as a sale you should wait at least 2 confirmations from miners that this was a valid transaction.

The difference is that banking requires very high barriers to entry, and securing the bitcoin network does not.
You have all the ability in the world to make a difference on the bitcoin network but not in the banking industry. Miners usually understand the protocol the most as they deal with issues that take a lot to figure out. As well they deal with the same transaction times and fees and no they dont always make their fee back as many think... The miners are the only ones determining which chain is secure and you are just confirming that between them.

To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-
of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number
of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the
block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU
effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed
without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block
would include redoing all the blocks after it.
!!!!The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision
making!!!!!!. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. !!!!!!!If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains.!!!!!!! (Nodes in this paper specifically meant mining node unless SPV, which is vulnerable) !!!!!! To modify a past block, an attacker would have to
redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up
diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.
To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,
the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.

Your node will not validate blocks from the shorter chain. If it is not the longest chain, it stops and switches to the longest chain. I watch it do this daily when I check my nodes. Apparently you don't run any nodes or miners. I also mined alts. Alt coins are not the enemy. Attackers trying to change and claim bitcoin are. 
BTW I never once promoted bitcoin becoming an "alt coin". BCH was always laughable and Segwit2x, just as much... 
They are just alt coins because the miners will always mine coins they can profit on. Not lose their ass mining failing altcoins that are created as an attack to the mainchain.  
And yes I do understand how it works (more than some who claim they do). I also understand that users can decide to go to an alt... But the foundation will always be core bitcoin for the go to crypto.     
If you just learned about how bitcoin works recently (like this year), I suggest spending several months using all aspects of it. Mine some bitcoin. Edit the code. Make your own for fun... Stop making a fool of yourself trying to show up those who know how it works. Then figure out why, if there are sooo many users and so little miners, why the majority of miners still mine BTC and not any fork of btc. Thanks.  
/------------------------/
We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the
next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner
and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of
ownership.
The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend
the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every
transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to
issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.
The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the
company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.
We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier
transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care
about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to
be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and
decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be
publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the
order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the
majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.
The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a
hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a
newspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the
time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in
its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.
To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-
of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number
of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the
block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU
effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed
without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block
would include redoing all the blocks after it.
The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision
making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to
redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up
diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.
If you cannot understand this, please study more. As you are wrong.

Thanks I run several full nodes and mined bitcoin and many alts in the past. There are about 10,000 full nodes currently. Of that, how many are mining? 
The nodes connect to the longest chain. The nodes create the transactions, the miners create "find"  the blocks of transactions and verify them and then add the block to the correct chain that the nodes are verifying. So essentially it is the miners who control the chain and the the users who follow. This is why a 51% attack by miners can cause the users nodes to become confused and follow the wrong chain as the longest chain and wont realize it until a miner not attacking finds a block on the proper chain. It's all miners, not nodes that do the work. Nodes just confirm the longest chain with eachother.

You can't fail enough...
According to YOU, it is impossible to double spend, no matter the hashpower. But that's not true and yet it has happened in Bitcoin as well as other cryptos. Yet you claim that if you run 51% of the full nodes you can create a double spend and fork off with a fraudulent transaction, when in reality, All nodes AND miners are responsible for concensus and not just Full Nodes. In fact full nodes can be attacked and manipulated by miners. You can deny that all you want, but you live in fiction. In reality, a 51% will change the concensus to allow for a wallet to issue txouts that match the max value in that wallet to you and then reneg and send it back to themself and the block would conform to that new transaction AS LONG AS the attacking miner is the one Creating and validating the transaction block and 51% of the miners (that the attacker operates) agrees on the change.  All nodes WILL accept this until another miner issues a contradictory block essentially confusing the nodes to avoid proper timestamping of transactions.
I'm sure you'll disagree with this because you think you can change consensus of transaction security through Full Nodes... :P
You can change your node but youll need miners securing your new blockchain. Miners run on full nodes and are required for validating the transactions in the blockchain by putting them in blocks by hashing and attaching that hash to the blockchain... The Full Nodes either accept or deny it, but the miners secure the consensus through hashpower.

Actually I am a developer, it is clear there is a rampant misunderstanding of nodes in the community and I hope more will read the complete whitepaper and understand the reasoning and importance of bitoin mining, incentive, and node useage. I also have built my own blockchains using multichain. I run multiple full nodes in multiple cryptos. I watch them connect and disconnect from nodes the have shorter length than the current block. I can tell you that you are not understanding the system. You can argue. But again, the security and control of the concensus is done through mining, not nodes. A full node is REQUIRED to mine, hence why bitcoin.org mentions full nodes validating blocks. You have to actually mine using the Full Node to validate blocks.

Your definition of Node IN THE WHITEPAPER is off...
thats your problem.
If you reread the white paper, which you should do, you will actually realize, the word miner is mentioned once assymilating the Proof Of Work to Gold Miners.. 
Only Miners are completing the proof of work which creates a new block.
I guess this is the end because you are brainwashed and can't figure out what is controlling a POW blockchain. 
Keep attacking me though since it makes you feel better. 
I hope you realize that neither of us are pro2x and we are infighting over something very basic and since the wgitepaper terms have broadened... And you are debating the broadened definition of full node vs what Satoshi intended in the white paper.  There are also discussions on this.
Jorge Stolfi - Professor of Computer Science
Not just silly, but stupid. The "full but non-mining" relays, inserted between miners and simple clients, contribute nothing to the system, and completely break its security model.
The protocol gives no financial incentives to those relays, so who knows what their real motivations are. There is no way to tell whether they are doing what they are supposed to do. They could censor client transactions and hide the majority branch from clients, serving them only a minority one. Indeed, this exactly what the UASF golpistas intended to do...
Those relays were added to the model after Satoshi left, when the "Elders of Bitcoin" found that they could no longer afford to mine. By the protocol's logic, they should have become simple clients: only verify the transactions that were relevant to them, and trust the miners for the rest.
But those Elders could not accept the idea of losing the control of "their" network. So they invented the concept of "full but non-mining" relay, fixed the Core implementation to insert them between clients and miners, and told themselves that they were the real bosses -- who supervised the miners and kept them "honest"..."
Also, if you read Etheruem white paper you will start to understand how the Miners are required for consensus.
Your Full node only verifies the parameters of the transaction. It does not determine consensus unless it is specifically mining. That is why Full Nodes that are maintaining consensus through POW are getting paid and your full node is not even though you used money to bbuy the HDD and paid for data on the incoming transaction. It is stored in your local replica. This is where you can be left behind (forked) if miners change to another consensus algorythm. THIS ACTUALLY HAS HAPPENED ON HUNTERCOIN. I also run a huntercoin node. I need to download the entire old HUC wallet and an updated HUC wallet and when the old chain is caught up to the point of the conversion I can sweep an old HUC wallet... Then I have to send it to the UPDATED Node for it to be spendable...
Thank you for wasting my time. I hope you learned something about how the network works, if I listened to you, Id be less intelligent. I am actually 100% positive you are not a developer because of how important you think being a developer is to understand how such a system works... I've been studying it over 3 years. Goodbye.

So why is Bitcoin Bad? 
@_date: 2015-09-04 11:11:33
No, and 37coins sms wallet is now no longer supported.
The USA does not NEED bitcoin. Ghana does. Zimbabwe does. Sierra Leone does. They all have cell phones, but a wifi connection can cost their whole months pay. And getting 4g/5g cell everywhere is 10 years down the road.  
The USA is the last place bitcoin needs to be.

Now those are REAL lessons learned from Bitcoin. It also made me get deeper into programming and web development. What a great tool for inspiration.

What is Bitcoin? A Peer 2 Peer transaction system. If you are not running a full node, you are not a peer, you are using a peer to transact through, thereby, the peer runs the node to transact, and if you're not running a node, you're not a peer.
The bitcoin white paper can clear it up for you.

Set up 6 nodes and miners on your local network to confirm the transaction instantly.

It is really simple. 
You buy bitcoin, it goes up in value.
You have cash, it goes down in value. 
You get discount with bitcoin.
Use bitcoin to get the discount, then rebuy bitcoin with cash which is losing value. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:35:26
Shoulda just replenished btc with your savings. :) Always replenish.

Just move your btc off coinbase as soon as they give it to you. Then you can trade/hedge with altcoins if you need to. But I agree with not leaving your coins on an online exchange.

As a service I enjoy small blocks, as a user, I want big blocks and small fees, or faster blocks... something to keep fees down. 50 cents USD 1/4 day of work for the underbanked.

but then it just dropped $400... you did this!!

LOL No it didn't Plunge anything. See you at $2000 on the next plunge!

It's stupid funny for someone who just jumped on the teenager wagon and looks around at what's going on... Someone claiming to have a mine (has miners running) and a video of fish and plants... lol Mining Farm.  Yes!!! it is classic stupid funny.   Not sure how deep your head is up there but from out here it's hilarious.

In a January blog post titled "Shrinking the Fed's balance sheet," former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke warned against the Fed actively trading its balance sheet. "I worry though that, in practice, attempts to actively manage the unwinding process could lead to unexpectedly large responses in financial markets," Bernanke said.
Well, there you have it. Bernanke admits the falseonomy they've created... The fear is that once the false market starts being torn down, the true free market will react and cause instability and collapsed values... Because they FED was the only one keeping the value high... 
Keynesianism fail.

Hodl is the correct answer... put it in a full node wallet or a supporting wallet provider and HODL. If a HF happens Hodlers get both coins, just like in ETH which was $5 at the Fork and ETC $1...  Now add the profits up if you held and compare with any stock...
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:53:35
LOL who cares? BTW, i wouldn't give away the location of my mining farm... unless you have security... 
I have no clue who Dan is or why he has to prove he has a farm... But this is fucking stupid funny.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:42:08
Welcome to the club! Learn HODL asap. Buy the dip. And don't fall for FUD. Remember it's a deflationary free market and the price does bubble often. Don't be a daytrader unless you're able to be a day trader and watch 24/7. Thats why Most of us HODL!

Because unlike your savings account at your bank, the value of your money actually goes up over time. It's nice to be ble to buy more with less 1 year from now. Your 0.00001000satoshi $500 will be worth more than $500 Federal Reserve Notes. It does not matter what some people bought at 7 years ago.
If this were the case, no one would buy btc today. I mean all these people bought at 10 cents, 18 cents, 1 dollar, 5 dollars, 100 dollars, whatever... 10000 btc pizza

When you print your own currency from thin air, Govt Debt means Citizens Profit. The more debt created means more money flowing in the hands of the people... This explanation is the basis of our Keynsian MMT economic system. Unfortunately, it is a faulty system and only hinders true financial freedom and forces maximum control of the economy on the citizens. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:37:49

If you have coin on the chain when it splits, you get coins in both chains.
