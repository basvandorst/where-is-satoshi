Bitcoin Core development has been taken over by Blockstream. The only thing they care about is to adapt Bitcoin Core so that their company can profit off of it:
There's no coming back from this. However, original Bitcoin was preserved as Bitcoin Cash and it has 8 different dev teams working on it so it can't be taken over that easily:
* Bitcoin ABC
* Bitcoin Unlimited
* Parity Bitcoin
* Bitcoin XT
* Bcoin
* BTC1
* Bitprim
* Bitcrust

Sorry, I was being sarcastic.

Bcash (coin that combines Bitcoin and Zcash tecnologies, launching in Q1 2018) at this time has no users at all, I think Litecoin has at least some users?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:51:12
Try r/illuminati maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:14:18
Litecoin is basically the same as BCore, just has less users using it, so it solves nothing.

Good luck with that.

But isn't it an attack on BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:25:32
Doesn't seem that way, they just announced full support for Bitcoin (Cash).
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:28
Are you sure about this? Bitstamp also has Bitcoin Cash trading support.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:07
U mad bro?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:47:06
Good argument.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:40:24
No, I call Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash. BCore is Bcore.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:50:48
Are you aware that BCH fees can be as low as a fraction of a cent since blocks are never full? I don't think BTC fees with Segwit would be $0.025. In reality the difference is nowhere close to 5x.

I think he posted wrong link:
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:39:07
Yeah, I wouldn't keep my hopes up about merchant adoption for Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:58:51
Good luck with that.

Seems you've already fallen into Blockstream's trap. But since I won't be the one left holding the bags what do I care.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:03:58


Yeah, why use any services at all. That goes against the whole BCore's ideology of being a "store of value".
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:36:32
I agree, Bitcoin (Cash) is very much alive.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:46:30
In what direction things are moving, though?
Most merchants are dropping BCore support as it has become unusable as a currency (Steam is one of the more notable ones).
And we also see many merchants starting to accept Bitcoin (Cash). I think this post is a good example of that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:30:53


Good argument.


Actually, Bcash (coin that combines Bitcoin and Zcash technologies) isn't even launched yet so your claims about security are somewhat far fetched.
Also, have you heard about BCore death spiral?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:24:37
Bcash will only be launched in Q1 2018 so there's nothing to get out from.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:22:31
You're misinformed, Bitcoin Cash transactions can be sent for basically free, Litecoin most certainly isn't cheaper.
Faster block times like in Litecoin decrease security so it is not a beneficial feature.
Also, Litecoin's scaling roadmap is the same as BCore's so if it was to get any adoption it would eventually run into same problems as BCore.

Watch out guys, we got a badass over here.

Original version of Bitcoin that follows the whitepaper - without Segwit, Replace by Fee and it currently has 8MB block size (that will be increased as needed) as opposed to Bitcoin Core.
