Like I said "average".

In case anyone was wondering these will have approx a 120 day payback with 0.07 $/kWh power....at a 43% difficulty jump per month.
I don't think we will maintain a 43% with the avalon chip orders showing up.

"unofficial" is your key word. And for the most part Mon through Fri get shipping updates on their website. 
What other info do we need at this point? 
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:00:44
That was actually put forth by the commentators earlier as a possible thing to try out. Since the comments tended to go off track.
@_date: 2013-07-30 15:06:21
Have you purchased one of their products?
Current projections put all their product lines at turning a profit as long as you receive by November. You won't make as much as if you had received earlier but you could have bought earlier, from someone else or not at all. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 11:32:23
But they are still shipping units every day. How is that belly up?
@_date: 2013-06-11 19:35:53
that i would like a link too.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:26:42
They still don't mine fast enough....Thats what people are saying. Nothing about the heat or electricity matters if it can't mine fast enough.
@_date: 2013-08-11 21:24:31
Used my power info. Cant start in mid aug so had to split the diff between aug and sept start. Aug was a 79 day payback and sept was 170ish.
@_date: 2013-07-30 11:52:28
5 day a week shipping updates is more accurate.
@_date: 2013-06-26 11:35:38
Anti-BFL circlejerk downvotes incoming. 
No one forced anyone to order, everyone knew they were placing orders for something that didn't exist at the time. They just act like spoiled kids throwing tantrums cause they didn't get an Avalon batch 1.
@_date: 2013-06-26 14:30:50
Only supplier that is shipping quickly is asicminer, and you see their prices right?
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:04:44
"Saw" this on "This American Life". Not bitcoin, but bitcon cut out the middle men of the cell phone company. But their app will run on garbage phones while bitcoin requires more robust hardware.

This is the big point...people just don't ever consider that while inefficientstill a better deal.

Not a whole day. I believe they were referring to German orders.
@_date: 2013-06-01 03:36:00
Sucks, but as a miner I'm not going to lie: I'm also a bit happy.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:25:43
so the GPU does other things.....and cost less? Less energy is good but not at that price.
It's fair to compare the two and its fair to look at the expected ROI. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 05:01:48
Just a point as you had said they (BFL) weren't shipping. They are (I'm not endorsing them as a great company).
The AM blades only exceeded this toys cost in the first one. Every other one was an average of 30% lower. You mentioned like these are the prices that people have always paid for the AM asics. They aren't; they are overpriced.
There may be a good reason why there is no competition at this market price point: Nobody thought there would be enough people out there that couldn't do the math to buy these in any quantity that would make producing them worthwhile. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 03:56:56
Honestly we get your point. Anyone who had placed an order had every single one of your thoughts. We don't need them repeated a billion times. 
They obviously didn't have their shit together. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:33:42
BFL products are shipping now. Just not many at once.
The ASICMiner 10GH/s units are 50BTC as a sale item. The first auction had ones go for comparable prices to this toy.
Won't return its initial cost anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-06-01 03:41:22
Well said. It may just be the beer but I want to hear you talk.
@_date: 2013-07-30 16:56:29
You bought from Avalon right? Batch 3? You are projected to make 27% above cost over the next year.
I bought back in September. Originally purchase 2 jalapenos later upgraded to single(total cost 1300 for 60Gh/s). I will make 86% above even on my investment. Just saying that while not as excellent as some of the earlier orders I will be happy to make that. 
You say you wouldn't want to buy from a company that delayed product that long but you didn't get a refund for your batch three that you waited for 2.5 months? Did you recieve any compensation for the decrease in profitability you are looking at? Didn't the price get set such that you would break even at 3 months? 
You got screwed. I think i will be in profit in 1 month. 
Bitching you didn't get the product that you knew wasn't finished is pointless. Everyone who has orders could have been refunded long ago. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 18:56:11
Couple of points:


Your words from your post. 


Which is it?
I first quoted your % above even and stated you were projected. I didn't think i needed to state my number was a projection too. 
What numbers are you using to base your projections on? I'm using  with 100BTC as your cost and the 46% increase.
No need to insult anyone's intelligence.  I referenced your post, i know you have an Avalon. 
My comment "Bitching you didn't get the product that you knew wasn't finished is pointless. Everyone who has orders could have been refunded long ago." Was referring to the swarm of anti BFL people who had their opportunity to make their decisions and didn't. If they don't have a BFL order then they should be happy. If they do i hope they got their money back if it isn't going to be profitable.
Just to be clear, do you believe that BFL 60GH/s units exist? 


Do I need to point out the silliness of you protesting BFL on a post titled "Avalon took 150 BTC from me and wont respond"
You may have your order from your "reputable" company but it sure looks like others don't.
@_date: 2013-07-30 21:10:57


Your numbers only work if you pick and choose the value of your currency. Isn't that a bit self-delusional?


Look I'm not trying to dump on you or tell you not to mine (show me where i did), but if you want to hold up BFL as crappy for delaying orders and declining profits from late delivery i would be careful as Avalon suffered the same problems. Documented in this very post and elsewhere.
I'm not sure what "Piss Lips?" is intended to mean. I believe we may suffer here from a culture gap. I would suggest that further insults be chosen from ones that work on both sides of the pond. BTW I actually like Dr. Who and BBC news perhaps we can use these to build a friendship instead.

Just had Lab Rat (a forum mod) quit to avoid a conflict of interest. 
Honestly i'd rater see no comments then hear later of ANY deleting by moderator, employee or otherwise. But for a shipping update? Literally it was turning into people going "when is my order on this date going to ship?" They can keep that junk to other places.
Edit: clarity

1.2 Ghs/s, 2-7970 made like 20 btc mining with them and a 6750 I had. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:03:12
Ok, you paid 100 BTC for it as that is the only payment method (i think). If you had held onto that BTC, they would be worth $10,210 right now. 
Just saying. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:45:29
Nope I just spent 2K a few hrs ago.

Some guy had a 900 BTC short in his signature for 35.75$/Btc on one of the forums. Not due for another few months.

Pool fees can be worked in on that calculator. I suggest the pool on the sidebar as it has merged mining. Those extra percent may just push you over.
edit: Er sidebar or @_date: 2013-06-21 22:33:25
They are shipping by order pay dates not by  As of Thursday they were working on the first two weeks of September 2012

XFX PSUs are rebranded seasonic internals for some of their lines. Cheaper than seasonic and just as good. Check first though.
