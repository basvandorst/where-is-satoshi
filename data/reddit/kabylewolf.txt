Well.. 
I'll just put this aside to donate to the local soup kitchen or some children's charity once I do some research. 
THANKS FOR THE BONER!

But seriously.. how would someone get started on accepting donations for a charity? I'd like to do the change that I want to see around me, but lots of untrust-worthiness and wanted to figure out a way to get something going that people felt confident about. 
I'd love to donate to wounded warrior, red cross, or a variety of soup kitchens around me or whatever it is. I think it would have an awesome impact.

In all honesty, if you were angling for a larger charity to accept BTC. The best example I could think of would be to already start a wallet for it, have donations sent to it, and send the check to the charity showing this is what Bitcoin can do and then ask if they'd be interested in accepting Bitcoin themselves and showing them how. Etc. 
It's hard to have someone bite at a somewhat abstract concept such as this when there's a lot of prejudicial negative connotations with it.

I'm not saying it doesn't happen. 
It's just been dramatically less frequent. At least in my opinion. I liked when they used to post little charities where some dude would accept BTC on their behalf, cash the check and then post up the picture. 
It was awesome. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:50:14
Clearly they asked for it. 
I can understand why it's happened. It's just I wish we shifted towards a more generous community like we used to be. I think that would be massively beneficial to the community.

I hate to be contrary however I've experienced quite a bit of success with a small sum of money doing just that. However I don't trade every single day, but I'm vigilant to signs and I'm opportunistic. I mostly do my trades one day of the week (usually a weekend) and I usually always turn a profit. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:57:06
you got the BTC, I got the car parts. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:29:29
Why is this phrased as a question? I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND. 
But I'll say this... you don't have to choose one? 
It's just I haven't seen anywhere near as much of the charity stuff as before. 
Might be beneficial for BTC "PR"

Its to my wallet. But I have other decals that say "bitcoin racer" that will fit on the rear wheel arches. I had a few people donate before and it was really nice. There's another grassroots racer in dogecoin with a FC rx7 that I've donated to in the past. It was pretty awesome.

Gotta stay copacetic, man.

The risk I'll be taking wit BTC is something I can take and even absorb should things go badly. I'm not generally looking into a safer investment, just something where I can move investments around with the tide of the market. I've had a pretty good run so far using 2.5 BTC starting off and on weekends where I'm bored I can generally make off with .1 BTC or so gains of just moving stuff around for a few hours (makes for great beer money). Having the funds simply sit on BTC isn't a safe investment, however using it's volatility along with other alt coins leaves room for a healthy bit of gains, given you have good timing/instincts. 
It's pretty much how much I can get back with my current weekly trading method, during a year long period. I'll even be including documentation of how I found market impacting news, how quickly it affected the market, and what my steps were. So if I make errors, others can take note from it, if I make good moves, others can make note of that as well. Hopefully there's something to learn from this experience.

I've been trading consistently already with 2.5 BTC and on the days I do day trade I can usually get .1 BTC in the span of a few hours of trading and I pocket the gains from that. 
I'm probably going to put something more along the lines of 25% into BTC/altcoins and 50% into my investment account (of which it's already rather healthy in terms of diversity) and the rest I'll leave to collect in my checking around, potentially using it to purchase more BTC during a slump. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:33:46
Gross, why would you do that to a puppy? You disgust me. 
But on a serious note. More charities would be beneficial to the BTC image all the way around. I'd start a small one, but I have no idea how much traction it would gain with people being extremely skeptical of Bitcoin charities started by nobodies. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:11:29
Regardless. 
We donated, it used to be more frequent than now. I don't care if there's an ulterior motive, the end result was positive. People willing to give, gave money to a good cause.

So I am building a track car and I've funded a few parts with bitcoin and I wanted to spread bitcoin exposure at the race track. My first track day is on the first and I'm really excited. I ordered these decals but I feel they may be too large. Your thoughts? I also have a few other decals that say bitcoin racer on them in black that will go on the rear wheel arches. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 07:31:26
I guess not. 
When they lost the BTC, price fell due to negative speculation. Shot back up due to massive trading with us all buying the remains. 
This dip, I'd assume is causing a slow dip because it means a few things. For those uneducated it means that Bitcoin has the potential to just "be lost" causing negative speculation. Along with the newly re-discovered 200k BTC to throw into the "pot" it might have devalued it simply out of inflation. 
I'm not sure, but I'm more than willing ot hear others opinions. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 07:39:18
Oh no, I understand that. What I'm asking is the price of BTC, I usually know why it's dropping however in this instance I don't have the faintest idea. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:21:30
Hey thanks! I appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-07-14 07:33:01
So out of curiosity, what is your hash rate like? How much does your generated bit coin fluctuate? 
Im anticipating getting a power block to power all of the anticipated hardware. It seems I have the gist of things but I just have a few other questions that hopfully btcguild can help.
(Any good or better websites to recommend?)
@_date: 2013-07-14 20:53:50
what setup? stats?
@_date: 2013-07-14 08:32:56
So where would I go about getting one of these?
