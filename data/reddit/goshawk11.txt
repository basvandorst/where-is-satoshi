Full node running for the past week. Very easy to set up!

I’ve been quite impressed by the trezor team. The device has worked flawlessly and updates are issued promptly if bugs/ security issues are discovered. You can even check your Recovery seed to make sure that everything is working properly in the event you need to recover. 
There is quite a bit of information on their website about security. Don’t have experience with ledger.

I suspect we will also see reverse bitcoin ETFs and other vehicles. My biggest concern is an Amazon gift card type of bitcoin that is not actually backed by real coins. It’s quite important that the ETFs have enough bitcoin reserves to back up their shareholders. Interesting times!

Andreas is right. Bitcoin has seemed a little "needy" the last few months. Bitcoin does not need an ETF or Wall Street endorsement to reach mass adoption. Bitcoin was created to be an alternative to Wall Street. The Bitcoin protocol needs organic growth (merchant adoption, scaling) to become something we all use everyday. This process will likely be slower, but will provide more sustainable growth over the longer term.

Good points - the ETF will probably help with institutional adoption as it would allow institutions to more easily buy and trade bitcoin. It seems that ETF will make bitcoin more tradable and obtainable but doesn’t add too much to the usability equation.  In order to use the bitcoin in the ETF, bitcoin will have to be converted back to a fiat currency. 
It seems that the markets agree with your statements.  I still think usability and all of bitcoins properties as a better form of money are what the markets should be focusing on.

Yes, my point exactly. Bitcoin allows us to move from tangible good with required trust (in this case oral tradition because the stone could not be verified) to a trustless system.

Yes, if Satoshi doesn’t have the keys. I’m thinking that someone has the keys to all that cash.

agree - lost bitcoins have value, but are effectively worthless without the keys. I find it interesting that the Yapese had an abstract concept of the Rai stone as valuable, even if it was not physically present.
