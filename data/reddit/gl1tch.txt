problem is most Kanji characters have different writings for a word that could also have different meanings. 
Like: 橋 はし bridge 箸 はし chopsticks
中本　なかもと　Nakamoto (center book)
中元　なかもと　Nakamoto (center origin, the one you probably refers in your text)
諭し　さとし　satoshi (guidance, but will never be used in a name)
each Kanji character does have a different "meaning"
transliteration of Kanji to Romaji also causes problems. Satoshi or Satoushi ... "ou" means a long "o". these simple things matter. what if he choose to remove the long "o" and just use a short "o" to add anonymity?
so first you need to figure out how "Satoshi Nakamoto" is written out in Kanji. (i haven't seen a document where "Satoshi Nakamoto" signed his name in Kanji). find one and start from there.
choosing baby names is still mostly traditional ... they want the number of strokes for the name to be lucky. if the number of strokes in the Kanji is a bad number they will not use a name. so it is again important to first find how the Kanji for "Satoshi Nakamoto" is written.
So will the real "Satoshi Nakamoto" please stand up!

most customs agencies will put a note or a mark on the package stating if it was *officially opened for inspection*

In some instances ... in other parts of the world ... you're lucky to even get your package!

BoJ already implemented negative interest rates in 2016 ... regular, common people, are still not affected though.
