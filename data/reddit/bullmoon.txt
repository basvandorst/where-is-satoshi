The price of 1 BTC was as low as $13 in the beginning of 2013.  When will this increase in value start?
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:06:30
Why must ChangeTip go?  It's important to look at it objectively and not demonize them unnecessarily.  How do you know they aren't the good guys and that if we get rid of them, they won't be replaced by bad ones?  We don't.
We need to work to educate people so they can make more informed decisions.  Our collective decision making sucks.  From choosing the politicians we empower to the companies who will profit, we suck at picking the right people.

Define "taking bitcoin seriously".

So you're just guessing.  Nice to know.

It identifies the owner.  It might be a stolen credit card and this guy is looking for a low risk exit strategy to cash-in on those stolen cards.

My prediction is that the price will magically start going up again after the Berkshire vs. Bitcoin bet resolves.

I've read it up and down.  It says you can change the policy at any time.  It also says you won't sell our data to marketers but doesn't say anything about anyone else.  So you sell it to someone who isn't a marketer and they sell it to marketers.

Bitcoin **is** new and different.

There is no helping you.  You just lost .29965 BTC.

Maybe they meant diversify in the sense of not trusting one physical dealer.  They mentioned Lealana, so they are spreading out the risk that Mike(casascius) or Noah(lealana) made a mistake or have long-term malicious intentions.

Why should we trust you?
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:08:51
It matters.  This "you are the product" system is teaching people that their information isn't worth anything.  Collectively, it's worth BILLIONS.  Imagine another social network with all of the same features as Facebook but this one pays you for using it.  Would you use it instead of Facebook or on top of Facebook?  Many people would and bitcoin enables that.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:48:49
It also talks about how ChangeTip is a possible privacy issue.  How they are collecting very valuable data and what they can do with that data.  Or how they can just lose it to a hack.  People are connecting their social to their bitcoin wallets and that's a lot of information in one place.  We are empowering them.
  
The tipping etiquette and the other concerns should have been separate articles.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:32:52
The top 10 tippers are employees and investors and a majority of tips go uncollected.  This is interesting to me because I've seen talk of a pump around here and if they were trying to fake growth, why wouldn't they collect their own tips to show adoption?
  
It speaks more to the argument that people won't bother to bend over to pick up a penny.  Or maybe people do realize their data is worth more than a few cents.  Questions, questions!  This is a good start.
  
I'd love to see stats on users and their collected tips ratio to see if we have anyone with a gift for tipping. :)
  
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:20:07
Do you own or plan to ever own bitcoin?  I honestly hope the answer is no and I don't feel bad about feeling that way. ;)
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:16:13
This is a good article that spells out the possible problems with helping to grow a company that is not open.  ChangeTip could be a huge privacy liability, or not, it's up to them and the only choice we have is whether we help promote that service. I'm on the fence, I ignored Zuckerberg when he called me an idiot for trusting him with my data, but will I do that again?  I'm on the fence - we need a service like changetip, but we need it to be open and to commit to not selling us out.

A persons reasons for adopting it may or may not indicate intelligence.  The act of doing it is nothing more than an action that does not require intelligence.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:09:19
It doesn't work that way.  Miners don't determine the fees.  They can only try through selfish mining but that can't last without owning the majority of the network.  We've seen what happens when someone starts to own too much of the network.

It does not exist.  If it did, telling you about it here would likely get it shut down.

Bitcoin is constantly engaging new investors.  Sure, a new bubble will make news and attract more people at a faster rate, but will that offset the people who have been waiting to get out?  That depends on the rate of the rise and the amount of attention it gets as well as other factors.
  
Bitcoin is growing, even if the price is shrinking, I know that seems counter intuitive but that is because we have never dealt with anything like bitcoin before.  We are used to dealing with these issues separately so be careful how you apply traditional frameworks to measure its success.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:38:29
You're right but I was trying to be PC.
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:34:05
Please don't stop.  I hate that I felt like I had to clean it up to get my point across.  
@_date: 2014-12-16 22:35:57
There aren't even close to 15 million coins for sale.  Most of us who see bitcoin for what it is and understand its state, want the price to stay low or go lower because the next year will be the last year that many of us will be able to afford a whole coin.

You're assuming that facebooks reported user numbers are even real.  My point is that ChangeTip has data that Facebook does not.  This is valuable data and we are making kings out of whoever we trust with it.  Ideally we wouldn't trust anyone with it and would use a decentralized option that only shares what we allow to be shared.  Unfortunately that isn't an option right now.  My options are do nothing or ask questions and raise awareness through the process.
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:09:32
You've been spoon fed too long.  The market makes the news, not the other way around.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:12:04
You can decrypt it offline.  Ideally you would use a computer\environment that **never** goes online.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:52:22
You've already consented by using them.  They can change their privacy policy whenever they want.  They can share your details with a 3rd party who then sells it whenever and to whoever they want.  You consented to this already.
  
Big Data is both a beautiful and scary thing.  Lets hope it's used for good and not to further enrich the 1%.
  
Like I said, I'm on the fence and I may or may not accept that tip.  The simple act of accepting that tip further empowers them.  My experience with Facebook has taught me that my information is valuable and that I should be careful who I empower with it.  Look at what Facebook has done to its users over the years.  Endless security breaches, misuse of communications, backdooring their whole operation for the US Government, running psychological experiments on its users without them consenting.  And that's just a few of the things we know about.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:43:29
Where did you find the metric that indicates the majority of changetip users are facebook users?
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:20:10


They can't do it in secret so many of us will retaliate and disrupt their ability to mine.  
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:55:35
That didn't even make sense.  Everyone with a brain is able to look at bitcoin and realize that it is not a ponzi scheme, I'm not worried about those without one since I can't do anything to help them.  It would be futile to try.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:22:47


  
I disagree.

You got downvoted too.  Have an upvote on me!
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:07:42
I like that do-it-yourself option.  But back to the trust thing.  Do you attempt to be open in any way like publishing your identity etc.. ?
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:57:54
Their reserves are small.  The most valuable commodity they own is not our bitcoin, it is our personal information and the connections they can make from us just using the service.  It is an intelligence agencies wet dream.
