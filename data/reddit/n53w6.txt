True, but as a user he/she is the one who brings the value to the network. The miner might have lots of asci and nodes but with out users he is wasting his resources.

Btc and overstock are highly correlated and  trade with each other with a delay.

It would be a direct replacement as heating is already electric.

They will lower interest / print money (QE) to maintain a stable value with BTC.
This is exactly what has happen in the US. 
Stock markets dipped, so the FED cancelled  the planned interest rate rises.
And the ECB is / has to do the same but thier interest rates are already negative so they are providing free money to European banks.
@_date: 2019-03-12 03:33:50

Do you not worry about pure dictionary attacks?
Also the attacker can start with the most common words to shorten the search.
It is still a very hard problem but a smart attacker can work out the cost of the attack.

I'm 100% with him on this.
It won't all be in bitcoin, but it will all be in "crypto".

Central banks are actively surrendering the store of value use case of fiat currency.

As I understand (I could be wrong), for a ln channel to work both parties must provide collateral, ideally bitcoin although other crypto assets could be used in future e.g. menero.
If someone does not have bitcoin they can't open channel. Could a service be created where a cryptolocker is used as collateral?
The security model would be the loss of data instead of loss of funds.

During UASF (segwit drama) there where a lot of arguments about the power/role of validating nodes on the network.
For a long time these arguments centred around "economic" nodes e.g. exchanges, payment processors, wallets etc.
Initially Bitpay strongly suported segwit and 1mb blocks.
However this very suddenly changed after a very large investment from Bitmain.
Bitmain were attempting (and suceeding) to buy off key actors in the space.

No, but maybe we could have an explosion in remote control robotics?
Particularly in farming/mining.

Yes, but I've passed the point of rationality. It has changed my view of finance forever. Hopefully for the better, but that is not guaranteed.

Is there kyc?

There used to be a few bitstamp shills around that would jump into every thread to defend bitstamp. Even they have disappeared / resigned.
I guess their social media game is now at the same level as thier exchange service.

Possible the biggest dump of the year. Still time to transfer funds to the exchanges :)

I don't see the point unless they will insure your coin against theft?

Is this true for gold? People could "merge" mine gold. Does this effect the security of gold?
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:20:21
No, they are just smart enough to turn up when all the hard work is done. It is normally a very good sign!
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:57:49
Such an attack would damage the value of all "bitcoins" and would not be a rational business decision. Not saying it could happen just that it would not be profitable.
@_date: 2019-05-20 08:27:12
Oh, that's not good.

He was a big bitcoiners back in the day, he used to make excellent YouTube's vids.
Snowcaps was just a side project.

Aoc is good for btc.

Major benefit of cfd's is the tax treatment, they are classed as gambling so tax is 1% of stake instead of capital gains.
You could use this to hedge your existing position, but I think this might be a legal grey area.

You think you are paying the vending machine, but really the vending machine is paying you.
All hail our new pizza vending overload.

Brexit is fucking up sterling and it's probably going to get even worse.  :(
No body wants the pound right now so they got to try and keep the average working people scared so they will swallow the huge losses. :(
Edit: upvoting to try and save my British friends.

I hodl tesla, but I know a desperate pumper when I see one, crypto has taught me that much :)
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:32:02
Total truth!
I have my trazor ready :)
Exchanges will act the same as banks when the time comes. They are good people but they will be at metaphorical gun point.
Add you stenght by holding your keys and your BTC :)
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:19:02
Is that the same circle that said BTC would disappear in 5 years, (3 years ago)
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:25:11
Come on guys, this shite is scammy as f**k. Have we forgotten about all the other scams btcjam, bitlending etc etc
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:33:39
Sorry to hear of your troubles.
I too have used coinapult in the past, always though they were one of the better companies in the space, it really hard to assess counter party risk in this space :(
Edit: just noticed from thier blog that they got involved Cryptocapital :/

I am surprised that CZ didn't have a RBF script ready and could have stopped it before 6 confirmations.
It makes me wonder how long this hack has been going on?
@_date: 2019-05-08 06:11:14
Agree, this sounds like some sort of man in the middle attack.
If you have been comprised the hacker can continue to show the correct balance until you try to move your funds.
People may be hacked and not even know it yet.

I'm so used to the old address format that the new ones freak my brain out a little.
There is something about immutable money that makes people like me very cautions.

Anybody else's access token for coinbase been revoked?
I can log in and see my funds, but there where some nervous moments lol!
