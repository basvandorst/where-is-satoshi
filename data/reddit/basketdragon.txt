Damn mike Hearn and his drama

@_date: 2015-12-02 18:51:29
......Or people will still be buying the same amount because of stagnant adoption  and mining operations will have to close down or downsize because of lower revenue. Is the other possibility with the halvening. Usage drives everything.....Metcalfe's law. So get out there and do some evangelism! 
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:47:28
This run will probably stop soon and the price will settle around $425 as the new floor for a week or so until the next bull run, then it will repeat again......kinda the pattern I've noticed lately....or this could be your last chance to buy a full bitcoin before they are unobtainable for the unwashed masses and you missed your chance to be in the new 1%. Dunno man keep in mind I can't see the future but it's probably not the latter.....yet. LOL
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:01:33
Fuck, I want the price to stay low so I can buy more!
@_date: 2015-12-06 00:39:05
Buy the bitcoin, you're still contributing to the bitcoin community. By buying you're basically hiring the professional miners to mine.
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:55:35
By buying you are transferring dollars (or whatever other currency) to the miners so that they can buy electricity or food or space or whatever with those dollars.....thereby funding them to do their thing.

Hmmm interviewing at a bank while flaunting a technology that could theoretically make them obsolete. They probably either hate it because it threatens their livelihood or dont understand it and will think you're a nutjob. Good idea for a hackathon, bad idea for an interview at a bank.

@_date: 2015-08-21 14:17:00
I'd say it's not user friendly enough yet. You have to keep in mind that not everyone in the world are geniuses like we are here in r/bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:44:51
How much bulk are we talking about
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:14:22
Exactly, making bitcoin more user friendly is how we drive adoption. Not trying to make the masses smarter, historically this has just not worked ha. We need to make bitcoin dumber.
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:30:54
Lets do this! I'm in for the long haul
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:42:36

Ive never heard of bitquick before,Instant access is of paramount importance to me, I usually buy bitcoin from coinbase or college friends. I've tried local bitcoins but there is no one around my area. Thank you and good day.
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:34:22
It's a good idea on paper, but I've had mixed experiences with btcjam. I've made money by microlending but have also lost money from defaults
@_date: 2015-08-08 23:26:11
You can't just throw money at people. You have to educate them about it first, but teaching young people about it is very important.
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:50:12
This is genius, I'd patronize greece via bitcoin. I wonder what they could export?
@_date: 2015-07-17 13:44:13
In the short term I think that banks embracing cryptocurrency will lead to profit and a competitive advantage against other banks. In the long term these hybrids like citicoin will benefit bitcoin because of increased awareness.

Huh this excites me. I just ordered a test pack (I do enjoy licorice). I've been into bitcoin for about a year now and and this is the first time I've actually bought something with it. The experience was suprisingly smooth, I would say even smoother than a credit card and I know it is more secure (basically just scan a qr code and it gets verified in seconds). Well done gocoin and meanblackfox.

For now...until everyone understands it. Honestly in my experience I think it is eaisier. Don't have to worry about banks bullshit or carrying around stupid ass pennies. Change is very often misunderstood. When people first heard of email conversations probably went like "it's mail but it's in the computer, nah that shit will never take off paper mail is just so much simpler"

Shanghai and Hong Kong are going to compete to become the financial center of the world and cause another housing boom and then financial crisis similar to what happened between USA and England in 2008. There is going to be another global financial crash and every money except bitcoin will loose value. Then people will move to bitcoin as a way out and because it will be easier and demand will increase and in turn price will increase. rant over

Investing bitcoin to get more bitcoin by mining has low returns, but investing fiat in cloud mining when prices are high creates passive income, which I prefer.

Yeah but with bitcoin the bits will eventually become more distributed over time even if whales buying and selling they do have living expenses and when price goes down they aren't the only ones buying 
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:53:58

I still think coinbase is the best wallet/exchange there is. So you can't withdraw more than $10,000 a day the majority of users won't even feel that. They are the most established, and I haven't had and major issues yet. They probably have thousands of customers service requests a day.
