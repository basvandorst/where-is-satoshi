Do you have any sources? I can't find anything that explains how mixing bitcoins on a public ledger ensures these coins cannot be traced and tracked by someone with sufficient resources.

That's silly to say. You definitely *can* know who owns what addresses. Especially governments and especially when you paid fiat for bitcoins to acquire them. And *if* you do know someone's address you can track where they send money and when. In these ways it's less private than cash. 
Here's an interesting question. Say you have the option of committing one of two heists. You can steal $20 million in bitcoin, or $20 million in cash. Which do you pick?

I think you're missing my point. Perhaps it's how you define privacy, but I certainly wouldn't list privacy as a selling point of Bitcoin.

Because it's incredibly volatile and if the community can resolve some of it's glaring differences and be more civil it could bounce back, like i already stated in this thread. Furthermore, I don't short everything i think it a bad investment or buy everything i think is a good investment, im just not that good enough of an investor to do that. Maybe im wrong and bitcoin is going to the moon, i can freely admit that. You on the other hand, don't seem able to not start screeching at the thought of yourself being wrong.

I'm glad we both agree your initial claim, that I'm trying to tank the price of bitcoin by shitposting on Reddit, is really stupid and you backed down from it. 
I also don't actually have any bitcoin shorts open, I just think in its current state bitcoin is in a lot of trouble, not to say it can't bounce back. Believe it or not some people have bearish views on bitcoin and aren't involved in conspiracies to profit via posts on Reddit. Shocking I know.

Your predictions are way to specific to be taken seriously. Maybe you're a big boy insider with unique knowledge/insight and your calls will come to fruition but I call bullshit!!
@_date: 2016-11-20 05:14:45
In regards to the technical reasoning, that makes sense although it seems important to note that not everyone who uses the bitcoin source code is actively observing its state and maintaining an opinion on changes to the source/rules. Instead, it is a group of developers who for all practical purposes are making the decisions for the rules for everyone participating to enforce. Is that a fair assessment? 
If so, that implies that changes to the rules are made by the developers, instead of all the members of the decentralized network. And as far as I can tell from what you're saying then it is the developers who must all 100% agree on changes for them to be made? 
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:31:14
Wouldn't miners stand to benefit in that they are driving up the tx fee needed to get included in the block and thus will make more from tx fees?

i spent 10 seconds on the site and still had no idea what the value of using this service was to me. maybe work on the landing page?
@_date: 2016-11-20 04:10:04
why is it that any change in the system requires 100% consensus? It seems as though this would cause the problem of needed changes not occurring at the rate they should relative using a majority or supermajority rules for making decisions. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:00:41
Thanks for the reply. I have a few questions about your points.


I'm a bit confused by this- miners couldn't bloat blocks to whatever size they want, unless I am misunderstanding something. There would still be a very real block size limit, it would just be dynamic and changing based on how full the recent blocks have been.
In regards to your second point, are you saying this won't work because it would kill the fee market or stop blocks being 100% full? I can easily envision an implementation of this dynamic block size limit that would not kill the fee market and could work to achieve 100% full blocks with less backlog of transactions than the current system.  
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:53:04
I love you.
Now I'm cheering for the God emporer. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:52:45
When you say banknotes have security issues, are you referring to their potential to be lost or stolen?
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:32:56
I don't understand this. Why would filling up blocks benefit miners? the tx fees from the spam transactions would be paid by themselves and it wouldn't increase their chances of winning block subsidies or make them earn more in these subsidies. What am i missing??

If it was trivial to set up a mesh network to replace the Internet, why hasn't it happened? Seems like there would be a lot of value in doing so. Do you have any sources or research on the feasibility of a mesh network being set up that could host the Bitcoin network or replace the Internet?
@_date: 2016-11-28 21:02:13
This has been floated by a few people as objections to this idea. My question to you is why it matters if the system cannot tell what is legit non spam demand? Even using all demand, including spam, this would solve any transaction backlog problems as far as i can tell. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 08:57:13
Ty for the link, an interesting read
@_date: 2016-11-20 05:44:00
Ah ok, I had no idea that users of the Bitcoin code and network proactively looked at updates and changes to the code rather than sort of just trusting the devs, that makes total sense though as they are dealing with money. 
I am a bit confused still about your comment that 100% of the network must agree for changes to take place. Say the devs make some change that 5% of the users don't like and refuse to update to include. In this case the show goes on in the sense that the 95% who did update go on using the updated Bitcoin, without a 100% consensus on the change. What am I missing in my thinking? 
@_date: 2016-11-22 03:15:04
@_date: 2016-11-29 05:53:10
So this problem exists regardless of what the block size limit is though. As long as there is a max block size which 1mb is this is a problem. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 00:47:36
1. But the technology in them is decentralized in the sense that you can't shut them down. No matter what you do to Nintendo if I have a 64 console I can play the shit out of it. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 01:01:08
@_date: 2016-11-20 05:55:01
hm, i guess i just dont understand the logic. surely this has already happened in that the devs have pushed changes that some % of the users refused to upgrade to. By this thinking then the current thing we call "Bitcoin" should not actually be called bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:34:02
Why would the miners benefit from perpetually keeping blocks full? Would it be because this would mean everyone would need to pay higher tx fees? 
@_date: 2016-11-20 06:49:17
Thank you, this summary was as highly sexual as it was excellent!
@_date: 2016-12-06 02:49:54
Is this a joke? How the hell is this legal lol
@_date: 2016-11-28 06:09:00
I don't get why this matters. This would focus on all demand including spam and thus spammers would know the block size will adapt to the increase in transactions they cause when spamming making their spam far less effective in causing a transaction backlog? 
Edit: just reread this and i agree determining optimal block size given the inability to determine "real" non spam transactions would be a problem to this approach, but i dont think it would be unsolvable. and it seems like a dynamic block sizing approach VS a hard coded size or size derivative would also have a variety of benefits.

This seems interesting but no way in hell this could replicate the Internet with existing tech afaik. Bitcoin running in this mesh network wouldn't work is my guess. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 04:26:04
Key word here is that a independent decentralized network *could* emerge. I don't think right now this exists, nor could it be implemented very cheaply if at all.

It matters if you're asserting the people are going to be the ones that force this paradigm change to bitcoin. Apparently, you agree with me though and do not expect the people to force this change. So then, what is gonnna force this change to bitcoin where jp Morgan and co go bankrupt if not the people? Congress?

Most people care about their weekends, their sport teams and going on a nice occasional vacation. They don't care about putting power into the people's hand with a revolutionary decentralized money that the central banks can't manipulate the money supply of etc. that just bores them. the economic argument for bitcoin as a dominant world currency is by no means great one, but even if it were the most solid, logical, correct argument people just don't care enough about that sort of thing imo.

It is computationally impractical to reverse because to mine a block(add transactions to the chain of transactions, called the blockchain) one has to solve a cryptographically hard hashing problem. At this point bitcoin is about 7 years old (I think?) so that is 7 years worth of cryptographically hard problems being solved and chained together(they are chained via a hashing mechanism) that would be impractical to redo with any current existing hardware. 
Take that explanation with a grain of salt, I only read the white paper a few times and it was a while ago and I'm a bit stoned. Hope it's accurate and helps.

@_date: 2017-09-13 05:45:06
ummm. i have no idea what you should do man- probably depends on your personal circumstances. if you bought an amount you can afford to lose but beleive in bitcoin, hold on to it perhaps. what i will say is, there is a bunch of stupid fan boys on this sub who shriek "HOLD" and think bitcoin will go up forever and make you rich no matter when you buy in. fuck those delusional scum buckets, do not listen to them. buying bitcoin, like any investment, is a risk and given it's volatility its a bigger risk(with bigger potential reward)
