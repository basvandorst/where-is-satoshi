Thanks! It's taking me a little bit to understand this whole system but I think I'm getting it! Thanks again!

I love Dr. Who! but I need to catch up. I'm only on the Crimson Horror episode......

I really wish I could buy less than 1 BTC because I don't have enough to buy that much but I want to take part in this!
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:11:59
Yeah that would be awesome that way I'd be able to buy some keys for tf2. Even though I don't really need anymore weapons....

Does this mean that my $1.40 in bitcoin will be worth more?
@_date: 2014-11-19 06:00:48
Oh well then I was misinformed! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:17:36
Oh wow! That was more than generous! Thank you so much! I think I'm going to try to buy enough bits now to buy Far Cry 4.

They don't *gnome* who they're dealing with. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:06:52
Well if more people get involved wont that create more demand for bitcoin and increase demand? Especially if more people start using it?

No I didn't,  I'm still here. It was like 1 am where I was and I went to sleep before I saw this. And it seems to collect it automatically.
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:17:58
haha!  
@_date: 2014-11-17 04:23:36
Can you just write any word there?  Like what if I said  1 cowtail? Could I get that to mean $0.25?
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:58:46
Maybe now I can actually get a PS4 now that I can get it at a discount!

Exactly it helps get someone involved. Ive always been interested but I didnt get into it untill I asked if I should try mining with my new gaming computer and I recieved a tip (they said i shouldn't try). Besides so what if people are getting tips. Its often a few cents, it's not like theyre getting rich overnight.
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:21:05
Well receiving tips is how I got started even though I'm still relatively new! 
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:45:30
You guys, or should I say gentleman, are amazing!  Thanks!
