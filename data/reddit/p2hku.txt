You won't survive buddy, sorry. This is one of the stupidest thing I have heard. In the early days of internet there were lots of nonbelievers like you, now they all have 3 smart devices with mobile data plans.

They possibly could inflate the prices. Even though the transactions can surpass the thick fee layer by increasing fee by 1 satoshi they would still have to set the fee to &gt; 140 instead of &lt; 100. That's a whopping 40% increase.

I like USD but I don't like to keep it for very long. I use it to make investments like P2P lending, crypto and real estate.

Why not? For somebody wanting to spend his/her crypto millions it would be a convenient option.

Venezuela was a rich country 50 years ago. I still cannot believe the leaders screwed it up so big, it's as if they had done absolutely everything completely wrong. WTF???

In the late night commercials. Would work at least on 10% of people.

Warning from me too! DO NOT use Kraken, it's service has been downgraded to nonexistent! Nothing works anymore and you may have funds stuck there because withdrawals don't work for many cryptos anymore!

I have lost thousands of bucks and tens of hours just to do anything on Kraken. So far I haven't found a reasonable alternative to load up EUR too. One option is GDAX but the price there is also higher. The shit has been going on with Kraken for a long time and nothing has changed. I am now 100% sure the CEO is incompetent. Crypto business is a fast business and if they don't act fast now their business is dying fast.

Its like the daily weather forecast, always the same BS: We might have some clouds and we might have some sunshine and we also might get some wind.
