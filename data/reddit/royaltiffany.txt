This was the [interview](  and here you have her [response]( that started everything :) 
@_date: 2016-06-23 06:25:46
I dont think there is a "right way" with her. She would have probably done the same no matter the way they questioned her or the reason of why they chose to do so. The outcome would have been the same. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:35:06
That interview is from 2014 , you are telling me/us that in 2 years she wasn't able to increase her knowledge about digital currencies and not make a fool of herself in some "asshats" podcast?

**Update**: Something came up and the guys rescheduled for Monday.

Happy Birthday to you and may the odds be ever in your favor!!
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:03:32
Thank you :) But i dont have Starbucks anywhere near me....

I asked the same question after couple of guests complained for confirmation waiting and the answer i got was: did you considered double spending ? even for small amounts ? But while you`re waiting for confirmation you might consider chatting or flirting with the model.
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:06:00
No , i havent..but sounds like a good idea :)
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:01:13
50% is pretty attractive in my opinion as a cam girl, considering that other sites pay from 20% and hardly arrive at 80%. What is even more attractive about this site is the no chargeback and instant payment system and that's every camgirl's dream! I have been on XOtika.tv for over a month and i cant complain about anything...considering it's a new site. If you have more questions that i can answer from the model perspective i`m waiting you in my room [here](
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:13:41
I know about purse.io , some of the guys mention it to me...Thank you :)
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:52:58
Thank you :) It's a shame actually that the % is so small...
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:13:55
Hello not a robot :)
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:12:46
Thank you :) 
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:52:13
Lol, good idea for my first toy :) Thanks!
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:26:09
Well, I think i'll follow your advice and save most of them..seems like a good thing to do...

@_date: 2015-10-20 11:46:13
At least u tried :) 
@_date: 2015-10-19 22:25:51
That happens on every webcam platform. It's a risk u are willing to take when u start becoming a cam girl and u deal with it.
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:44:08
I am going to repeat myself in this reply but yeah...no matter how much i get payed on other cam sites (because i never gave a personal cc or paypal to anyone, so i used other platforms) there is always a big possibility of a charge back, so you spending 500 dollars on a show with me, doesnt mean much if u will do a chargeback after. Another issue about paypal or any other credit card is PRIVACY. If i give u my details, i wont have any..and one thing every cam girl likes ...is PRIVACY and anonymity. That kind of privacy and anonymity is what i was searching for when i chose to cam on XOtika.TV, a site fully powered by BITCOIN.
@_date: 2015-10-19 22:18:24
XOtika.TV is like any other webcam platform when it comes to realistically earnings. One night u can earn over 1 BTC and the other u can earn 50 mbtc. It all depends on the traffic , your patience and how u run your channel. If u have more questions feel free to send me a message here, or visit my channel :) Good luck. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 22:33:50
Thank you :) 
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:45:33
Or they never came out from the closet?!
@_date: 2015-11-06 23:29:14
Exactly. I had an old computer so why not use it. I did consider Trezor as an option tho. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:35:29
The point is that, using bitcoin , gives me the surety that i wont have a chargeback from you after one day or 90. Also, that after my show or when i sign offline i can have my btc in my wallet in less than 1 h, and i cant say the same about other cam sites when talking about dollars for example. Not to mention that every single bank asks for my ID, personal information which i am not so interested in giving. And merchants are already giving discounts when u use Bitcoin as payment. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:36:00
We are talking bitcoin here ...not dirty fiat!  And funny how u love your wife but still watch the naughty girls on mfc! Hypocrite much ? HAhahahahhaha 
@_date: 2015-11-06 22:33:00
PC, no internet connection, armory wallet. That's my cold storage. Now if you use the fridge for yours , sorry, i use mine to store food. :P
@_date: 2015-11-07 20:41:28
I guess some people woke up and realize the potential. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 23:07:21
Yes indeed :) 
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:47:59
Because drugs, prostitution and porn are an interesting topic ?! 
@_date: 2015-10-19 22:22:58
Because there are people who either dont agree with what the post is about or they dont agree with Jeff, Gavin etc.

I would love to be able to upvote your comment some 10 - 15 times more aahahah we are all perverts in one way or another ;)
@_date: 2015-10-19 22:27:15
It's one thing to watch a girl masturbating in a video, and another thing to interact with her. A girl in a video for free wont ever respond to you or your request. That's the difference. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 06:05:03
I don't see why it wouldn't. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 12:09:44
I honestly feel sad when i see people wont even try to know more. I get that bitcoin is not something the average person will use anytime soon but XOtika.TV was created for the bitcoin community..for people who already have, earn, and know bitcoin. It's their own decision how they chose to spend it. Or if they chose to spend it. Thank you for the wishes :) i'll try to do my best. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 05:52:43
Dont need it , but thanks for the idea :) 
@_date: 2016-07-07 00:24:28
Thank you :) 
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:51:21
But sometimes..just sometimes...it's healthy to give in to your impulses..specially when u feel like bitchslaping the stupidity out of some people...oh..wait..that's not the topic..oops
@_date: 2016-07-07 01:38:10
Apparently it is :) 
@_date: 2016-07-07 06:25:44
Ahahahahah thank you , and thanks for the offer :) 
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:04:27
I dont sell :) I HODL !!! Ahahhahahah 
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:50:03
People need to know about bitcoin, not that i have a QR. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:49:38
Thank you :)
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:48:06
