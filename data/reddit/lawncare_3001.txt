this is brilliant. Right away it reads as money and the @ sign indicates email to people. This could be universally understood, it looks simple 
too bad you're giving this away for free you should have copyrighted it

this guy created a monster in Twitter and he has no idea what he's doing. It's devalued the entire political discourse (reducing everything to its most extreme) killed nuance and actual argument and just ramped up tribalism and oversimplification
Twitter has allowed false rumors to spread around the world while the corrections get barely any percentage of the traffic. And they still can't figure out basic functions like an edit button! People have been asking for years.
Interested to hear more, but dang has Dorsey messed up with Twitter. Huge percentage of users are bots, it's such a bad thing culturally.

that is my opinion yes. The points you raise ---  alternative information channel with horizontal and decentralized information sourcing --- are valid but the point I was raising is length, of comments and oversimplification.   
Twitter has the uncanny effect of increasing polarization. Groups don't debate they shout at each other

Such a wierd argument to begin with. How much energy does the consumption and production of Hollywood movies "consume?" How much does, say, video games?
@_date: 2019-04-15 21:25:51
yes but ' proportionate to its utility' is entirely subjective. Should people shut off Christmas ligths and not use gift-wrap for the holiday season?
There are dozens of human activities that take up energy equivalent to bitcoin -- internet porn probably uses as much electricity all things considered

what's really hilarious is that John McAfee already promised, quote, to "eat his own dick" if bitcoin is not $500k within 3 years
