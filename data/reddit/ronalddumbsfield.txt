Believe it or not some people don't like banks or credit cards. Also, what about cash businesses. It's none of the governments business to tell people how to spend money.

A decade for a new currency isn't shit.
*...And imagine the return on a 10yr investment of a few thousand!

Yep, Fees and Times are the only thing holding it back...once that is all worked out it's gonna boom.

Everyone forgets that Bitcoin is still fairly new...as more large companies adapt it and it becomes easier to spend...the price will go up. It's not going anywhere...just dumbasses panicking.

Bitcoin is a helluva drug.

Low wages, high prices, high tuition...is what keeps people down. But the dollar isn't that strong, it's not backed by gold or anything anymore...while Russia and Japan buy the shit out of gold. Crypto is still the future...

Japan, Russia, and India...I personally don't see it going back down much.
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:35:06
Russia, Japan, and India would be my guess.
