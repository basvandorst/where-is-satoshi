Yeah. Been waiting patiently for about a week now.

Sure it is. That's a pretty dumb thing to say. Humor at the expense of others is pretty fucking funny. I have alts, I'm still laughing at this gif. Maybe you just don't have a sense of humor. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:43:57
Yeah you're right. Probably like you and didn't have a sense of humor.

Sorry not sure what you mean by an aggressive position. 
For me I use the online savings account to hold my emergency funds and extra cash for a vacation. Basically money I'm not going to touch for awhile. Better to have the interest rate than nothing. Otherwise it's just sitting in a checking account doing nothing until I need it.

Temporarily for 8 years while making the corporate tax rate permanent.

As someone else said if you have enough money to make a difference you should probably be investing. 
Online banks do offer higher interest though. Ally and Discover are 1.25+ right now. At least higher than inflation.

You can do it OP!

If something increases in value exponentially it's difficult to look at the most recent data points on a graph. It just starts to look like a vertical line going to the moon. 
So an easier way to view the data is in a log graph where one (or both) of the axis is scaled logarithmically. A logarithm is basically just an inverse exponential. Someone above me linked the wiki. But what Lee meant was just for how you view the data over time. 
[An example](
Both are showing us the same data here but one of the axis is scaled to fit the trend of the data more accurately. Hope this helps.

Yep. It's called irony. Glad you logged in just to let me know you didn't get a joke.

Not the person you asked but my loans were anywhere from 3.5-6.5%. That's not private loans though. Those goes much higher I believe. Depending on your credit.

Seriously? I know it's fox but can they not look at a graph? Do you have a source for that? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:45:34
Lol. What a fucking joke. I bet some intern was told to make that title 'three day low' but didn't think that that was actually news worthy so they assumed they meant 'three year low'

Honest question. I tried both and decided on delta because they both did the same thing and delta is a lot better looking. What feature makes Blockfolio better for you?

They use the same calendar as us for age. When they are born they are legally age 1. They're legal age is increased on January 1st. It's kinda weird because a child born on December 31st is age 2 on January 1st. I think it's done for their school system. 
They do use the lunar calendar for holidays and I believe many traditional Koreans will use it for their birthdays but birthdays are not as significant an event as it if for us in the US.

Careful. It would also be a logical fallacy to assume if someone is guilty of an ad hominem attack that they're argument is bullshit. Just because I insult your mother doesn't mean I'm wrong about something (or right). It just means I'm probably a dick and your mom uses bcash.

My bad. I didn't see your edit. Im an idiot that thought you were the original comment. Should check usernames. But I still have no idea what point you were trying to make with the analogy. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:41:30
I'm cool. I just have no clue what point you were trying to make with your analogy. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:26:54
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:51:39
Think you mean 1976 but yeah your point still stands. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:29:15
So you admit the banks are scamming people? Not sure you thought through this analogy. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:37:49
No. Pretty sure you're reversing your original comment because you realize it makes no fucking sense. 
I'll humor you though. So the banks are either con artist or guilty of negligence? Still not sure you thought this one through.

House is a bit different. Have to keep paying taxes on it. If you lost your job and are having difficulty finding work it can ruin you. Housing market can recover but it's not something that a lot of people have the extra money laying around to wait for.

People are naive. It's not a good excuse but they can easily get led into believing that they're not even lying. 
The real problem wasn't lying from the applicants. The real problem was banks were giving away loans to anyone and everyone. Taking on high risk mortgages because they knew when it all fell apart the tax payer would be there to pay for it. They knew the government wouldn't let them fail. They paid our politicians to be sure of that. 
Privatizing the gains and making the losses a public problem. America is not capitalist anymore. If you make bad business decisions you should go out of business. Banks are a business. They're not a public service. In any other area of business no one would be sitting here putting any blame on customers for a failing business. 
It's supposed to be a free market. Instead its all just a big fucking joke.

Millions of fools wanted a home and were assured it was ok to lie on their loan application by the God damn bankers they were asking for the loan from. 
Ask yourself. Is it more likely that millions of people are liars and it was all just the banks getting tricked? If you believe that I don't know what to do for you. Sure, there are probably hundreds of examples you can point to of people taking advantage of the corrupt banking system for their own profit. Of course. But if you seriously think that's the majority of people or even a significant minority than again I dont know what to do for you. 
It's nice to think it's just idiots with 5 homes that they couldn't afford that were the ones that got the short end of the stick. But in reality it was thousands of everyday people that lost their jobs and their homes through no fault of their own. 
When the housing market crashes even people that paid cash for their house are negatively effected. Your house is worth less than you paid for it. Maybe you lost your job because the whole damn economy is crashing. 
Who do you blame when the housing market crashes? Joe who got a good interest rate even though he had insufficient income and horrible credit? Dude just wants a fucking place to live. Maybe you blame the people that... now this might be a stretch but... maybe the people that control the God damn market? Maybe the people that knew that the tax payer would bail them out. We gave the banks a high reward zero risk reason to bubble the market by removing all regulations that might prevent it.
