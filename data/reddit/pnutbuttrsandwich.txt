I've been to a forum last night about Bitcoin and blockchain being hype or disruption and there were many in the room that feel pessimistic about the adoption.
Being an optimist and a noob, I'm interested to know if there is a possibility for Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency) to co-exist and co-benefit with fiat currency?
