Generate a wallet and a seed offline using electrum on TAIL and only ever access it offline on tails (non persistent obviously) import the private keys into an app like mycelium when you do want to spend. Make new wallets regularly and commit them to memory. 12 words is remarkably easy to remember when you generate a few seeds and look for a memorable one. Keep a verified version of tails on your phone memory card too incase you have a 'the hangover' moment.

I talked about this with someone ages ago. The mined coins go to all the artist's. Weighted with the distribution of another sister-coin/smart token which the end user buys and allocates based on his tastes. Rewards for spotting new talent on the network would work like investments. You go in early and spend $1 if he turns out to be a superstar and you helped spot or promote the guy you are rewarded with a short period of free mining. Sounds abstract because I'm too busy and lazy to type but it holds water

It challenges the unquestioned logic that we should continue to use a fractional reserve, debt based system. With our current system, it is a guaranteed fact that there will be some that have to go bankrupt. This is not the case with Bitcoin. 
In my opinion Bitcoiners sometimes fall foul of appreciation and giving credit where credit is due when it comes to our existing financial system. As a money supply to really grow an economy at full speed, it could be argued that the exponential function we currently have with FR has served us well to get our collective countries to the economic podium we occupy now, it's just a sensible realisation that exponential growth is no longer required. There was a case for fractional reserve one time, just not anymore.

Standard level paranoia where private keys are concerned.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:35:20
You actually have a bit of a point. If you took multiple paper wallets around like notes you are effectively carrying notes.
The merchant processor would have to provide change 
The note wouldn't be reusable. 
If a merchant processor started to accept the private key redemption style of payment and the qr codes all had a built in change address as well as being encrypted with a pass phrase you enter like a pin, could be a good idea. 
It would require a way to read the QR code and it's not reasonable to expect ever merchant to have a camera. Saying that, every tablet does.
@_date: 2015-01-01 11:32:03
OR, let us smart people keep earning your Bitcoins. Yep,  that's a good plan.
@_date: 2015-01-04 10:14:51
That stands to initial logic, but if there was a merchant side function allowing ANY individual QR code to be computed a maximum of 3 times then it would work. Whether this could become a BIP and whether the client printing the notes would need an Internet connection to do this I'm not sure. There's always the option of using a much longer alpha numeric passwords with unlimited attempts it just less convenient and not reminiscent of chip &amp; pin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:59:11

Theoretically it is possible to generate revenues by just having a user base be it referrals advertising or the like. Blockchain.info don't seem to have any serious revenue streams yet millions in investment pour in. Circle needs magnitudes more money to upkeep obviously but was it part of some longer play I wouldn't expect them to change anytime soon 
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:02:33
Well you scan the QR code and any remaining get balance gets send to your pre specified change address or change "note". 
They could be encrypted with a 4 did got pin utilising some kind of merchant side script that restricts to 3 guesses too. 
Can lose them, have them stolen and the note and pin concept are widely understood. 
Plus, printing your own money... 
Just requires PSP support and a client like electrum or armory to integrate the note creation

Privided you want to buy on a regular basis, the best advice is actually to join localbitcoins and build some reputation. The problem you need to conquer is them trusting you not to reverse payment with PayPal. After you have a few months old account and quite a few trades where you specifically ask them to mention in their feedback **paid me via paypal***, this should be less or a problem.

What OS are you using? Try and find the actual wallet file on your computer. In Ubuntu its in the home directory as a hidden file (just press ctrl + H to make it visible). If you find the wallet file try restoring that file into electrum. If it is actually your wallet file it should let you unlock it with your password inside electrum and then you can back your seed up.

You could make an agreement with a trader here. Check the details with actual designated companies as I don't know if any are connected to the UK faster payments system so fees may take a slice off. Selling each bit individually to a trader on Localbitcoins would be laborious but with one generated seed on say armory for example a broker could give you 500 fresh bitcoin addresses. You use the email back and forth to track who's paid etc. 
For all I know there is a UK faster payments PSP, just thought I'd give you another option.

These very basic terms relate to markets and aren't in any way being used arbitrarily like you seem to think they are. A spread is a very specific thing, I suggest you google it because "the difference between two rates or prices" is not it.
If you are one of those strange people that likes to play semantics, you need to practice that too. You might have had a leg to stand on if he had phrased it "There's a $30 spread between Huobi and US the exchanges", but even then you'd look pretty dumb as it's colloquially incorrect so pointing this out to him/her would have still been appropriate.

What I'm struggling to understand is why a collapse in this ponzi scheme would cause a crash in price on the exchange?
Surely the nature of a ponzi is that this huge pile of coins we're expecting to see get dumped doesn't actually exist, surely? The coins are used on the fly to pay out the lucky investors who would surely be cashing out as they go? Even assuming there's a central ring to this thing there's still no reason to assume that they're going to want to dump all the coins. Or am I wrong?
