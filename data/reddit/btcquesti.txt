Agreed. I threw some money at BTC, ignored it, and before I knew it, it had grown massively. I wasn't aware of the risks involved with keeping it on an exchange until recently (thanks to this sub!).

Well, consider this scenario:
You bought 10BTC 
You sell those same 10BTC 
You gross $10,000
Let's assume you're in the highest tax bracket, and that this was a short-term cap gain, so you'd pay 39.6% or 3,960 to Uncle Sam, and retain $6,140 net profit.
Why not just reinvest that $6140 at these sub-$2,000 prices?
You can talk about not being able to time the market, but the idea that capital gains somehow makes it better to hold during this period isn't really accurate. 
You stand to gain at least 3 new BTC with your profits when you reinvest the profits, and assuming you reinvest the original amount as well, you'd now have 13BTC @ $2000 instead of 10.

Sure, but Coinbase accounts are already tied to one's identity, regardless of what IP address one uses to sign in. It would be easier to use a VPN if that were the case. 
That said, I'm no expert, so if we have an attorney/judge/CPA here, please shed some light on the capital gains issue when it comes to cryptocurrencies. 
Do I wish the US was a bit more like nearly every other nation when it comes to tax? Of course! Can I do anything about that now? Not really.
Speaking as a husband and a father, I'm not going to risk spending time in federal prison in order to save some money in tax. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Ahh...ok, this is what I was wondering. I know I can sweep over to Gdax, but I wasn't aware that I could just sell the whole lot if I wanted.

Curious: are Gemini's buy/sell limits that much higher?

Question...how many coins do you feel comfortable storing on one device? I'm thinking I may want to split them up.

US citizens/residents have to pay taxes on cryptocurrency gains, yes. 
Did you not see recently that the IRS had issued a summons to Coinbase for all user info, (including passwords and security settings!!!), etc. 
The IRS backed down a bit after some members of Congress warned them that this measure was 'overly broad'. So now they are requesting info for users with transactions over $20,000. 
They'll get their subpoena, one way or another, and people who thought they could outsmart an agency with, for all practical purposes, infinite financial, forensic, and legal resources are going to have a very, very, bad time.
The IRS will fine you silly, then a federal judge will put you in prison. 
If you're in the USA, don't be stupid.

True, not arguing with your logic. Much of life boils down to probability and risk tolerance I guess.
