Nobody knows what the value of BTC is going to be in the future. Personally I would consider it way too risky for investment at this time. 
However, it is always a good time to investigate something if you feel it is an elegant technology or an interesting phenomenon. 
A small amount (0.1BTC?) is enough for practicing. You can setup different kinds of wallets and send some bitcoin from one to another, buy something online or even at a physical store, follow the addresses and transactions in the block chain, etc.. to get an understanding of how it all works.

There is a difference:
If you have 100 shovels, you can not mine 100x more than if you had 1. You also need 100 _people_ to man those shovels and they will likely want a share of the profit.

If Apple introduce their iCoin, it can become very successful if they get retail chains on board. (Im not American, but I'll try: target, best buy, star bucks, banana republic, ?)
However, it will not ruin bitcoin.
In the part of the world where iCoin will work, it makes the idea of digital currency more acceptable and lower the threshold for those same chains to take bitcoin too. The part of the world where iCoin does not work is where bitcoin was going to make most impact anyway.

If you buy for a fixed amount of £ (say 50) per month, not a fixed amount of BTC (say 0.1), then you 'automatically' buy more BTC when it's cheap and less when it's expensive, so the average price you pay per BTC will be lower than the average pice has been over that period. 
It also makes more sense because your income is in £, not in BTC.
Edit to add:


Be sure you can _really_ _afford_ it. Coins get lost, stolen, and are volatile. Then again, historically, anyone who has held on to bitcoins for more than 3 months, has seen the value rise.

I have never used localbitcoins, but here is how I would go about it:
Create a paper wallet or an offline wallet. Generate an address in this wallet. Import only the address (not the private key) into a wallet app on a phone.
This way the phone can be used to verify that the bitcoin have been transferred to the address, but the phone can not be used to spend/steal them, and even if you lose or break the phone, you still have control of the address that holds the bitcoin you bought.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:17:37


It would be nice if you could send the change to an address of your choice. (Like a new paper wallet.)
Once the private key has been 'in' my phone, and the public key has been exposed in the block chain, this paper wallet is no longer cold storage. (Not as cold as it was before anyway. Depending on your level of paranoia.)
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:28:28
No. That is the difference I pointed out. The difference between physical mining with shovels and crypto mining.
People can easily run multiple bitcoin miners, but using multiple shovels is actually slowing you down unless you add the same amount of people as shovels.

If you have created a new paper wallet (not a paper backup of your online wallet) you can send the balance from your online wallet to your paper wallet.

Yes. If you click on the transaction, (see link from JohnWasser) then you can see a little warning triangle next to the estimated confirmation time. If you click on it, it tells you what's wrong/bad/weird about it. Though not in much detail.

I think so too.
The proper jargon would probably be '_critical_ _mass_'. 
The answer may still be 'no' but it depends on what you consider failure/success. I don't think it will completely die, even if it ends up being a currency for 'thanks and favors' for internet geeks. (crypto-kudos?) All it takes is for someone to keep mining blocks.
Critical mass is reached when _not_ accepting bitcoin is too much of a disadvantage for businesses. For this to happen requires cheap, simple, secure tools for ~~consumers~~ everyone.

You can put dollars in at one end, do the buy/sell thing, and have more dollars at the other end. 
This would be nice if you could keep repeating this, but you can't touch those dollars, other than spend them on MtGox itself. So BTC are worth more dollars there, because dollars are less useful there and therefor worth less.

You're not making it clear whether you think this is a Good Thing or a Bad Thing. Your examples of kinds of work suggest Good. But making it easier for kids to work for money without adult involvement may have a dark side.

If you do nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide. If you use crypto, you are obviously hiding something, so it is probably something shady.

If you have an always-on, always-connected machine, you can still consider running a 'full node' (bitcoin-qt or bitcoind) even if you don't use it as your wallet, but to become part of the network and help distribute the block chain.

At least in my case it's the curiosity factor. Not so much the convenience or security.
The best way to get to understand how Bitcoin works is to own some bitcoin and try it out.

In the advanced details of your transaction in coinbase, you can get the transaction ID. You can then search for this ID in blockchain.info. See if it says anything like 'small output', 'low fee', 'non standard', 'spends unconfirmed output' ...

The difficulty is so high _because_ so much hashing power was added. 
This way, the network keeps the mining rate at the predetermined level, regardless of hashing power.

Your question implies that they put their savings in bitcoin to begin with. At this point, bitcoin is much like cash or gold. Not in the sense that you can (not) easily send it around the world, but in the sense that if you have a lot of it it's cumbersome to keep it safe from theft and loss. 
For 'normal' (sorry) people to keep important amounts of assets in bitcoin, they need a way to trust a trusted party with keeping it for them and they are wiling to pay fees for insurance. 
Even for many tech people it may be too much bother to keep secure distributed off-site backups, and rather pay someone whose business it is to do that and guarantee it.
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:53:16
I do not support that statement. It was in reply to "why is [the term] _crypto_ currency bad?"
Most people associate 'crypto' with secrecy and hiding.
Outside our bubble, many people (especially in the western world) feel that their government, police force, secret service, .. protect them from the bad guys, and would gladly grant them unrestricted power to do so, and make the "if you do nothing wrong.." pseudo-argument. Even today, sadly. 
These are the people who need to accept bitcoin for it to 'go mainstream'.
I believe that this is why fimp says that 'crypto' is as bad as 'virtual' from a PR perspective, and I agree.
@_date: 2014-01-17 14:13:20
Cool, thanks. Sequential vs. random order makes sense.
I guess you will still need to have all the actual full blocks, not just the headers, before you're 'online' enough to know your balance. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:48:16
...and your bank account.
But yes, buying bitcoin takes about 30 seconds from deciding to buy to seeing the (unconfirmed) transaction on the network / in your wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:01:28
I think that killerstorm means that the 'compromised system' is the users PC. Whether your wallet is on some service or on your own PC, you still use the (compromised) PC to authorize the transaction. Anyone who can watch you do that can replicate it later. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:42:00
"You have a bitcoin address like you have an email address" is also ..ehrm.. '_simplified_' I guess.. 
Many people use a new address each time for receiving, and abandon an address upon spending from it and send change to a newly generated address. 
If you send an email to an abandoned address its probably no big deal. With bitcoin, they are lost. 
(Hopefully BIP32 becomes mainstream fast. It will make this issue less problematic.)

At the store, they present you with a QR code that contains the address you pay to and the amount. You scan this QR code with the wallet app on your phone. Your phone then broadcasts the transaction to the bitcoin network. The store sees the transaction on the network.
If you buy an xbox they will probably want to see 1 or 2 confirmations. If you buy a car they will want to see 6.

In general, not just for bip 0038, as more computing power becomes available, it becomes more important that your pass phrases are strong.

You could ask for more information in the reports, specifically about the 'reporter wallet'. 
* Which app/service was used to generate it?
* Was the private key exported to.. / available on.. online computer (which OS/app), mobile (which OS/app), paper only, .. 
* Was the private key encrypted? Was the passphrase 'available' on an online device or only in your head?
* Were wallet backups ever transmitted by email / IM / dropbox, other lockers? Were they encrypted? Strong?
I know you have the free text box (and that complexity should not keep people from reporting) but having a bunch of structured fields helps picking up on interesting patterns. 
Good initiative tho. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:30:14
Yes, at some point a crypto mining operation requires rack space, operators, and even cooling towers, but it scales much better than people with shovels. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:27:20
AFAIK, Armory also requires you to run a full node.

It strikes me as weird that the database that is used by a p2p network gets distributed using some other p2p network.

It depends on the software you use. Better make sure before you're unhappily surprised.

Many people have NAS boxes (iomega, synology, qnap, ..) that are linux boxes on arm or atom chips. They are typically always on, always connected, have plenty of disk space, and doing nothing most of the time. No mining power tho.
Easily installable packages for the most common/popular boxes could help get more nodes running.
@_date: 2014-01-18 16:48:04
But phones are more likely to be lost or stolen than PCs. Also, typing strong passwords on a touch screen is cumbersome. And you have to be careful to transfer backups off your phone in a secure way. 
(It will help a lot to have Armory-style or BIP32 mobile wallet apps.)
If you're going to dedicate a mobile device to only use as a wallet, and you don't put any other 3rd party software on it, it's pretty safe regardless of the OS. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:58:32
It is because stuff you want to buy/pay is not priced in BTC.
You could express the value of BTC in carrots, beers, hamburgers, gallons/liters of fuel, ... but until these items are priced in BTC you'd still have to convert via dollars, euros, etc.. to calculate the number.
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:32:49


Armory uses deterministic wallets. You can have a watch-only copy that generates the same address sequence as the full copy, but without private keys. But they use their own implementation, not BIP32.
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:15:46
I don't know if this makes it more complicated:
If many people buy stuff with bitcoin at your dad's shop, you may not have enough cash of your own to put in the cash register. In that case, you may have to sell some bitcoin. 
At this point, I'm not sure if you can pretend to sell the bitcoin you just got, or if you have to assume the bitcoin you sell is the oldest you have, and pay tax on the price difference.

My guess is: to detect patterns / trends / outbreaks / etc.. and issue warnings based on those observations. For example when some app or service gets compromised, it may go undetected and/or unexplained for a long time if nobody is keeping track.
