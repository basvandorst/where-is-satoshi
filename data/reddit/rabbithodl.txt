The infrastructure of this enslavement is far reaching, MSM is generally 99% owned by the corrupt and so callled elite. It is just a propaganda arm used in conjunction with the cartel of central banks utilised for money laundering and bribery.
The little blip in respect of the 24hr price of bitcoin, will also coincide "*excuse the pun*" with the flood of trolls into r/bitcoin, for example the idjit that allegedly lost 4 btc on the LN", including those who will swarm in shock and horror to this fake event.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:36:36
It's very simple! the world is like a Titanic ship, heading towards a giant Iceberg. Bitcoin is the lifeboat.
However! those at the helm of the ship will do anything to distract the masses from the danger ahead. 
In the interim of this disaster they are also spending unlimited amounts of fiat on propaganda to spread panic about imaginary holes in the life boats, whilst also spending unlimited amounts of fiat buying the Bitcoin boarding tickets at the same time.
In conjunction with the above masquerade, they will attempt to short Bitcoin into the ground, to panic your average Joe into parting with his life saving asset. You will note that r/bitcoin has been infested with the detritus of humanity "aka traders and banksters" with their legion of subservient minions with multitudes of sock puppet accounts spreading FUD.
I would suggest you do a little bit of research in respect of Bitcoin, look at the world economy, digest the facts, and make your own decisions.
