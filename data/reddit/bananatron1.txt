Market makers don't keep an asset stable, they keep an asset liquid. HUGE difference.
@_date: 2013-07-08 02:50:39
Liquidity basically means a shortening of the gap between bid and ask. It makes it easier to sell when people want to sell, and buy when people want to buy. That has nothing to do with people's fluctuating perceptions of the value of Bitcoin. A market can be highly liquid and yet highly volatile.

I'm sad about it too. Having just recently started talking to my friends about Bitcoin, I look like a retard now. "How that's Bitcoin going? *wink* *wink*"
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:02:52
Oh I see the problem then...
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:17:12
I think a more serious flaw is that when people invent super mega awesome quantum computers that can crack codes in seconds, the whole Bitcoin security will fall apart, and Quantumcoin will have to be invented to counter that. In fact, let's start Quantumcoin right away so that it's there once the problem surfaces.

regarding the comments, tl;dr. But basically, yes people need to stop treating bitcoin like a commodity, and start treating it like a currency.

Well, the fact that it isn't mandatory allows for the adage "A fool and his money are soon parted" to still hold, which is very important in the grand scheme of things.

I'm actually keeping the Bitcoins I bought, I'm not in it for the quick bucks, I'm in it for the right reasons. However, the people I introduce to Bitcoin, I can't really expect them to understand this... They probably just look at the BTC/USD ratio and think "less money = bad", the obvious initial reaction. And that's really what makes me sad.

Use cavirtex.com, it's quick and easy, no ID required.
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:00:35
What for? Personally, the way I use cavirtex, I just submit a cash deposit request on the website, then go to their bank and deposit the specified amount into their account. Less than 6 hours later I get the money credited to my cavirtex account... You must be using another one of their deposit methods -- a complicated one.

Yeah, if only there was an actual valid reason for this fall, at least
@_date: 2013-07-08 04:41:21
BTW I just summarized inter-exchange arbitrage in general. You're welcome. This advice is free.

Doesn't the fact that it didn't happen mean that time travel never gets invented in the future? Or do you subscribe to the alternate universe theory of time travel?
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:06:38
I'll join in the praise and say, very clever.
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:16:10
There's already a Bitcoin fund. 
So it's not the first.
@_date: 2013-08-04 23:37:36
Maybe, but it's still old news. Anybody who knows anything about TOR security knows this already. The article sensationalizes this and makes it seem like TOR has been compromised or like this is some amazing breaking news. TOR hasn't been compromised at all: Your browser with low-security configuration has.
@_date: 2013-07-17 07:12:06
So they're accepting Bitcoin donations again? I thought they had removed that at some point due to "legal risks" or whatever
@_date: 2013-07-18 03:56:15
Awesome! I'm glad people wouldn't shut up about it! Plus, it makes so much sense for the EFF to support Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-11 04:23:14
Oh the irony
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:13:46
The government will make all kinds of laws and regulations about Bitcoin, and we'll just continue on our own and ignore those laws and regulations.
Because laws worked SOOOO well to stop software/movie piracy. Am I right?
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:51:50
Use cavirtex.com, problem solved
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:29:08
P2P bitcoin exchanges are much needed at this point, it's the next logical step.
@_date: 2013-07-08 04:38:25
Because chaos theory.
There is no solid explanation for it, only hypotheses.
@_date: 2013-07-08 08:42:10
"How does one make money with US dollars?"
The answer is the same whether you're asking about Bitcoins, US dollars, etc.
@_date: 2013-06-15 07:52:31
I think it's an interesting idea. It would have to be primarily on the Internet though, I don't think you could expect physical events.
@_date: 2013-07-07 08:10:36
Nice, this is going to be a great way to drown my sorrows about the falling Bitcoin price
@_date: 2013-07-08 04:40:05
Finally, an opportunity to make 25 cents a day from enormous amount of cash.
@_date: 2013-06-09 16:25:42
I'm amazed the government thinks we will actually declare our Bitcoin profits.
@_date: 2013-08-04 17:49:41
You mean that TOR isn't secure if you browse it with Javascript enabled? That's old news...
@_date: 2013-06-15 07:54:36
oh there are? do you have some links/references, or you heard about it through forums, etc.?
@_date: 2013-07-06 04:31:57
Personally, I'm not annoyed by the fees, I'm annoyed by the new "account verification process" bullshit we now have to go through.
