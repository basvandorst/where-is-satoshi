I have left reddit for [a reddit alternative]( due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.  
   The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumped-up charges.  
   The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO, despite initial hopes, has continued the same trend.  
   As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.  
   If you would like to do the same, install [TamperMonkey]( for Chrome, [GreaseMonkey]( for Firefox, [NinjaKit]( for Safari, [Violent Monkey]( for Opera, or [AdGuard]( for Internet Explorer (in Advanced Mode), then add [this GreaseMonkey script](   
 Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on the comments tab, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.  
   After doing all of the above, you are welcome to join me on [a reddit alternative](
