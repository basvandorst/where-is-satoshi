More drugs and sex have been bought with fiat currency than bitcoin ever will.  Our own fiat currency is only worth the faith we put into it.

Just throw a spare 20 bucks at it when you have it.  Even fractions of a coin inflate.

I'm sorry, come again?

This bubble has been like all previous bubbles.  Price will rebound and then some.

I love these airheads.  There is only a finite amount that can be mined.  Hence an ever increasing difficulty.  Goodness.

Wish bitcoin could make us all rich.

This right here is why crypto currency will take over.  More exposure sparks interest from the general public.  Public interest bring investment.  Digital currency gains value from the faith people put into it.
How does bitcoin fix the wealth disparity problem in the world though, or is it supposed to?  Someone more knowledgeable on the topic answer this for me please.

WTF is going on!  Why the fuck didn't I buy a brajillion of these things at 70 cents?  God dammit!
