Go to program files\teamviewer check teamviewer_logfile see if you can find some info on the PC name that connected to you if they had a profile setup or just numbers maybe you can even contact team viewer and they give some kinda info if you provide their id number
Search the filenotepad file for addparticipant maybe it will show the name of a PC you know who knows

People will always be mining for bitcoins as long as the system is in place, after running out of coins miners will be mining for fees for each transaction people send.  With enough people using the payment system the fees will add up to make a good size block reward, hopefully.

Its upto you which coin you mine, then you exchange the coins for BTC like most people do, or hold them and hope they become more valuable. The market for altcoins is sometimes very volatile.    
I think you might be thinking of cloud hashing as BTC only which yea all the companies out there are just gonna rent you what they have for mine for btc and you are never going to hit your ROI
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:16:42

BTC increase could let some of the companies use some of their increased btc/usd value and buy more hardware to make more dividends, but it shouldn't really relate in a way that quickly

never heard of it
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:18:17
700 mhash a week gets your around .16 a week, by next week when the difficulty goes up it will probably be half of that, then 2 more weeks half again.  By 2 months im sure ill be wasting more money on electricity mining then money from BTC.  By investing in a company that keeps upgrading their hardware my 700mhash keeps getting upgraded.
@_date: 2013-07-03 13:55:18
every week they sold out of their new USB and they keep above 20% network hash

@_date: 2013-05-21 21:24:00
You can mine for other coins, but it looks like you dont know much about what you are talking about with finding blocks so it will probably take your a little to set it all up.  Just buy a bitcoin and invest in asicminer shares or buy a bunch of litecoins under 3$
@_date: 2013-06-19 14:37:21
asic miner went from 35 TH to 16TH(only dropped 20TH) we went from almost hitting 175 TH down to 111 TH right now

Read into Alternative coins, maybe you can make a type of system where you get different coins and can convert the coins over to BTC. I was reading someone trying to go live with cancercoins or something goofy or researchcoin i forgot its early still. Check around on bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:41:43
ahhh gotcha, thought you were saying they will be negative next time

@_date: 2013-05-16 23:59:16
what is your speed lol
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:12:34
if i buy 1 gpu at $400 ill get like 700Mhash, with these shares you are constantly getting the best new asics out there, think of it like you keep getting upgraded to the newest top grade gpu every week as asicminer hash rate keeps increasing.  I have a mining rig myself which at 3.6 Ghash i used to make .16 a day now im at .1 a day and its gonna get worse by the next difficulty increase.
