Is there any way to deploy this as a softfork?

IMO the next thing after ln will be side chains with ln between them. I've always thought we would stay at 1mb on the main chain forever and still think that.

How so, pray tell?

Hmm so the address literally is the redeem script rather than a hash of it? I guess that works.. Old p2sh addrs can be derived from the bch script since its in the address?

I certainly didn't mean to imply it. I said that 3mb can only be used for witness data. I'm still not seeing anything wrong with that.. Funny that this has struck such a nerve heh

I don't see where I said SIG's couldn't go in the 1mb.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:16:55
There is an implicit bucket in that the weighting for non witness data is 4x as high meaning it can never exceed 1mb. However it's implemented doesn't change the effect.

The only data that can go in the 3mb of witness storage is signatures. You could indeed make unlimited witness sizes, but most transactions only have one or two signatures

I explained what I meant, and it seems factually consistent with reality. None has said anything that contradicts that. Just a lot of hurr durr Jeff garzik this rbtc that none of which was brought up by me.

We'll have another shitcoin. It may take a while for bitcoin to recover from the loss of so much hashrate.. Ironically bch may help by drawing some away early. Eventually it will get back to normal.

There will be some limit based on the max transactions.. At 7tx per second there could not be more than 2billion funded addresses since the start of bitcoin. In reality I think the actual number of currently funded addrs is less than 50 million. The growth of the utxo database would also be a constraint, but I'm not sure how to quantify that. The software as it currently exists would probably not cope with 2billion funded addrs, but maybe it could be upgraded.

Its not really great.. What was agreed is basically everyone will get back around $450 per btc. That's what was agreed on, but now the price has risen so much there will be a lot of money leftover, which morally should go to the creditors but no word about that yet.

What difference is there?

It may be possible to import the mycelium seed words using electron (the bch electrum clone)
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:22:34
Its OK. Initially I was worried that I might actually be wrong about something lol

Most people using bitcoin are transferring it directly between exchanges. They don't bother to hold their own keys. The main reason Joe blogs buys btc is to speculate on btc, but also on altcoins and ICO tokens. All these payments can be taken offline by a douzen or so exchanges adding ln withdraw functionality. If you include btc debit card providers and bitpay that will take a large chunk of everything else, leaving only the long tail of geeks using trezors and PC based wallets still doing old fashioned on chain transactions.

Yes thanks we covered that.
