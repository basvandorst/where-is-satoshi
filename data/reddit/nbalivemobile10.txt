I can't handle this dropping 1k every week, I just want the price to at least stabilize for at least a bit around 10k or so to make me feel better lol ik i sound like a super newbie but Ive been paying attention to cryptos for a little over a year

Ive owned bitcoin for about a year but keep selling and buying at the wrong times, ik its unpredictable and volitile and we're in it for the long term and ive seen the graphs of the bitcoin bubbles. I invested a little more than I could afford to lose and I just wish we had hope  that it will bounce back at least a little bit sooner rather than later

I need some hope right now, lost about half of my money that I invested in bitcoin and other cryptos. Is there any hope we see a bounce back by the end of February? How much lower must the price go?
