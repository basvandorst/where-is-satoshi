I hold 0.2+ btc and lost $150+ thru NH. 
Wait, Its all alright though, I forgot it’s the ‘currency of the future’.

Have several unconfirmed transactions for over two weeks now. Can't even make a new one unless I spend $10+ on fees.

Nice , authoritative and well-sourced statement there.
From: 
*WikiTribune has been in contact with CEO Andrej Nabergoj, who said that NiceHash is “assessing the situation and working with the authorities. We’ll issue a public statement shortly.”*
Even if the money isn't gone yet, this is a huge public disaster for bitcoin. Together with the steam news I can't see how this is going to do any good for BTC.

I'd say that's purely down to increasing Ethereum usage, and that's as much to do with it's merits as Bitcoin's problems.
Bitcoin has had a negative market share trend for many years because of the introduction of more altcoins.

I sent a transaction just under 48 hours ago @ 5 sats. Still no confirmations, but I reckon 5-10 is the sweetspot rn. Just keep trying if it doesn't confirm.
