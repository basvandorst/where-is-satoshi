At this point I think I'd be more scared if these swings didn't happen.

Wałbrzych at the moment. Heading to Bydgoszcz  later this week. Finishing in Warszawa early August.

I'm in Poland right now. Where can I buy this?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:57:50
which price should we believe?  The trading platform or the retail wallet?  Either way, they are owned by the same people. I'll wait for the dust to settle before making my final decision, but this smells bad.  No this smells bad AND it has hair on it.

Keep smoking and leave the complicated discussion to us adults.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:17
yeah, having a $4k spread between the bid and ask price is totally normal. Don't be alarmed.  Nothing to see here.  Just keep moving...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:04
I would agree if I didn't see buy orders happening at $9500.  No sell orders even close to that.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:50:49
What the hell, GDAX?  I'm seeing $6 and $7 spreads?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:45
Does anyone else with a Coinbase account see the current price for BCH is $8500 per coin!  WTF?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:11
That transaction brought the quoting infrastructure to its knees.  It instantly sold off down to almost $15k - now working it's way back above $16k. Crazy is the only word I have for it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:48:00
Lol, right. It must be your blindness that won't let you see the chart.  Go back to sleep. These are not the droids you are looking for. Sheep.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:52:04
I wish that were true.  Here's the current price I captured after your post:

I've been involved with high volume trading for over 15 years.  There is nothing normal about this:

It's up and down faster than a two dollar hooker.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:33:20
Awesome idea!

It's not frozen enough for stop buy orders. It's only frozen enough to stop sell orders.  You smell that?  Yeah, it smells like dishonesty.

Nothing normal about this:

I bought these in December of 2017 directly from BitMain. I paid using my free BCH after the fork when it was around $3k USD. Each miner has produced an average of .66 BTC since I put them in service.
Each miner cost about $2,700 USD and 0.66 BTC is worth about $6,900 USD - not a bad return now that I put a pencil to it. That being said, depending on your opinion of BCH, one could argue it's ALL profit!
Disclaimer: I'm not calculating energy cost since I don't have any. That would eat way into my return if I did.

You need to keep eating!

These are in datacenter with a bunch of servers and storage gear. I pay electricity based on the tier I'm using, so by running these, I'm just using some of the electrons I'm already paying for.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:32:25
Is this price drop due to 'ol Craig gingeling his non-existent keys, lol?
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:48:09
I set up the auto buy almost 3 years ago. I buy the same amount in USD every single Friday. It's the easy way to DCA - set it and forget it.
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:53:36
I do this with Coinbase and pay the fee. Yes, it's less than optimal but it gets the job done. I'm in this for the long term, so a few extra bucks in tx fees won't kill me.

My favorite number to view each week is the BTC dominance number. Bitcoin is currently sitting at \~69 percent dominance above all other cryptos. That's very significant and the last time we were at this level was Q2 2017.
Another thing I think is important to point out. Each time we see a BTC selloff of any size (and everyone freakes out), as it starts to recover, it gains more dominance of the other cryptos - kind of shaking them of like a wet dog.
Just a couple of observations on this fine Thursday morning...
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:28:01
Yikes, that's painful. Sorry you have to go through that. Like what has already been stated, use a hardware wallet and verify the destination address on it every time.  I always check the first 5 and last 5 chars of the address no matter how little the amount. And when sending more than 1 BTC I check the entire thing multiple times and still get puckered up each time.
Can you share the destination address that ended up with your 1.2 BTC? I'd like to know if there are multiple transactions in that address.
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:46:19
Not a chance. FB want's total control. Going with Bitcoin would not allow them to be evil later on.
@_date: 2019-08-21 00:25:25
 I monitor these things periodically using the Slushpool app and I get notified when my BTC is sent to my wallet. Other than the day I installed these; I have not looked at the stats. I’m not going to lie, I’m a bit shocked that these Chinese hunks of ASIC chips are still running without as much as a reboot in all this time.
Anyone else still running miners?

Nearly $1000 selloff in just 40 seconds. Now THAT, my friends, is VOLATILITY!

Don't worry about owning 1 full coin.  The math still works out the same. Just be part of the game!

I just thought I would share how I spend/replace/hold my btc. It's pretty simple, but I do it religiously.
First, I buy the same amount of btc every week without fail.
I use bitcoin whenever I can, but I replace it by a factor of 2 based on the fiat value. For example, if I spend $30 in bitcoin, I immediately replace it with $60.
This allows me to always increase my holdings, but also contribute to the transaction volume.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:51:56
I completely agree with the $0 to $350k theory, but I've always used $100k as the top end.
I don't know much about Libra yet, but I do believe the more we see big companies like FB, Uber, Square, etc. embracing crypto, the better it is for us early adopters.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:44:44
Let's face it, bitcoin is still far from mainstream. We need more people using it on a daily basis if we want to see the value increase long-term. If I can show people around me that I use bitcoin and it helps educate them, I'm all for it. 
For example, I ate at Subway yesterday. This particular location accepts bitcoin because the owner really believes in it. I almost always pay using btc and more times than not, someone asks me to explain it. While I am sitting down and eating (and sometime talking to someone that wants to know more) I buy twice as much as I just spent. 
Maybe I'm crazy, but it's what I have been doing for over 2 years now.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:38:43
well, lucky for me I'm pretty healthy!
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:31:54
I don't think there is any one single reason. In my opinion, a lot of this is due to the general overall acceptance   
 of crypto (not just BTC) from big players like Uber, Amazon, Square and even the devil himself, Facebook. Crypto is here to stay, and having some big names now recognizing this fact is only helping the FOMO.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:51:10
I'm more excited about the fact that Bitcoin has 62.5% of the total crypto market cap than I am about the $13k fiat price tag.  Not gonna lie, this parabolic move reminds me of 2017.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:44:45
I'm interested in this as well. I'd like to setup a mainnet node to continue to learn, but not sure what's the right way of going about it.

Jaxx has stated that it's on their roadmap, but to my knowledge, they have not started development yet. It's hard to believe that Coinbase may be the first iOS wallet with Segwit that's worth using - that was painful to type, but it's true.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:21:41
I guess it's not worth spamming anymore now that SegWit is gaining traction.
