Derp. The goal of a max size is to avoid 100gb block with 1x10^9 transactions. Are you aware that minor could: generate millions transaction micro-transaction with no fees then include it in his block once he find a valid nonce? (block)

What does " (a) a pro rata return of bitcoins and fiat currency" means? If i had 1 bitcoin and 10$, on mtgox, does it mean i will recieve my 1 bitcoin and 10$, or a percentage that what they recovered (so something like 100 mbtc and 1$)? If it's the second option: WHY are you happy with this deal???? im confused...

A lot of critisism here. I went to Vancouver ATM. No identification (it was wierd). So it took me less than one minute. So im satisfied.
Please do your best to make bitcoin completely legal :)

You can do offline things with Armory. 
I personally have tried them both and prefer Armory, even if loading takes forever. 
Armory feel more secure and have a lot more features. 
Good luck OP

Do NOT install this game. Its horrible.
* You will receive spam every 30 seconds offering banners and video for tokens. Really annoying.
* The mecanic is dumb: invest (bit per seconds) or tap (bit per tap). Yup. just tap. again and again.
* You cannot even customize your room or anything. Well, you can but you dont pick what you want. IF you buy bitminer 1.0 you will receive a white shredder. Thats it. No options.
* There is a lottery thing: 2$ for 5 spin or 1$ per spin. Real dollars.
* The game force you to follow a certain path
* NOTHING IN THIS GAME HAS TO DO WITH BITCOIN: the currency uses filesize notation, the investment are in weed and holographic dating, wtf is a gem, no blockchain, no wallet.

OP, you're stupid. Bitcoin is the first experiment of its kind.

It's not stupid.
First, once again, there is a ton of fees for doing that...
1. Register on their website
2. deposit $$ with Paypal (paypal -&gt; $$)
3. then buy SLL for $$ ($$ -&gt; SLL)
4. then buy BTC for SLL (SLL -&gt; BTC)
5. then withdraw btc (BTC -&gt; Wallet)
There is a 24h blockade for the withdraw of bitcoin. 
Good luck.

as a programmer im really confused right now. The output audio is handled by the OS, never the software (which makes so much sense).

Well, im confused but thanks for the info!

So ... the third-party newsletter got hacked, and someone in the wild have email addresses? Doesn't sound terrible. But I guess that from here you can try stupid password and steal people cavirtex account ... if they don't have 2FA. (also, popular email engine prevents the fake From field). But yes, I guess we can say there was a hack.

@_date: 2014-03-12 16:11:59
For everything but the number 3, you just have to copy the private key on your computer/cellphone. You will be both able to put btc in and out. you can put the private key in thousand of cellphones if you want (sharing the money). With the public address, you will be able to see transaction list (blockchain). Warning: if you send btc from your personnal btc wallet, they will be able to monitor your transactions too :P
@_date: 2014-07-10 18:34:28
My first experience: Went in a canadian bitcoin ATM, it was already logged in (?) so I did put my bills and received my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:59:25
Great question.
Please excuses the trolls in the comments.
I think you need to define things to student and teachers: the concept of decentralized, trust and encryption. 
* The decentralization is a little like illegal download: Everyone is part of the network, making it impossible for FBI to raid Bitcoin Corporation (which doesnt exists). 
* The proof of work makes it very hard to being the lord of the blockchain. But as a miner, you cannot change amounts or recipient, only refuse/include transactions.
* And as for encryption, just say something like: When you put your credit card online, only the website can decrypt it. Nobody in the middle of you and the server can. If this encryption technology break, the internet break. Using this technology nobody can edit recipient or amount of a transaction. 
* It cannot be a ponzi scheme because Bitcoin Corporation doesnt sell any. You gain free bitcoin by doing math essentially. Anyone can do it. 
I think your project is great, but this is complex. 
Heres some ressource for your studies :) [A lot of useful video]( [Bitcoin under the hood complex]( [bitcoin under the hood simplified](
Best of luck
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:11:45
I dont know if it is the case with CoinKyte but some system can take your coins, put it in your account (like exchanges service) and then you can spend it. A little bit like a prepaid bitcoin card that you dont have the private key. That can be a solution.

Usually, I pledge to receive something (on kickstarter). You are trying to build a company.

I will agree with you. Changing the bitcoin mining target is quite extreme and impossible. I was just looking for a solution, and it is the only one I see to buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin. That, or centralized solutions. 
To me, bitcoin isn't the currency, its the movement. And maybe someone will make an altcoin that fixes this problem and other by changing the mecanism.
