Oh ok that's what I thought. Is it noisy? lol. How are your electricity bills? Also, would faster internet make a difference in the mining speed? I would assume yes but idk

Thanks for the input. I've been reading that a lot of people are saying to just buy the bitcoins and sit on them (not literally of course) until they reach a higher price than what you bought them for. Is there somewhere where I can check when would be the right time to sell? Or should I just keep them as long as I can? What's your experience with Bitcoins?

Thanks, would you mind explaining why?

Awesome links, thanks! I like the first one.
Good luck to you on the proejects

lol exactly. I couldn't understand why I, or other investors, give him all of out machines when we could just do it from our own home. Maybe I didn't understand him or he didnt explain himself sufficiently but that's what it sounded like to me

So do you mine everyday? 
Yeah I'm really not a fan of the pre-ordering BS. Especially for a costly machine.
thanks for all the input, I appreciate it.

From the analysis it looks like the TerraMinerIV would definitely be a better buy


Would you mind explaining the variables that go into the assumptions? I thought an increase would be certain and steady, not a fluctuation.


why!? from the analysis they seem very profitable! what am I not seeing/understanding

Well my question was, what *really* is the tricky part about installing the miner because my friend made it seem like it was difficult and all so thanks for your answer.
As far as defining friend and all that, we're here to talk about bitcoins. Thanks

So what's your experience with mining with KnC? I'm reading that a lot of people would rather just buy the bitcoins without mining for them. Kind of a studpid question, but have you seen a return in your investment yet?
Yeah I really don't trust a company that says pre-order a 6K machine and we'll deliver it later.
What kind of cables are needed for it to be hooked up at my home? I honestly thought it was just a regular cable that comes with the machine and I could plug it into the wall and away I go. But my friend was making it seem complicated like we need certain wires that would cost a lot more money.
I wouldn't call it scammy because I trust the guy but it didn't make sense. Sounded like I was going to buy the machine, let him borrow it, he'll plug it in and take 20% of the income.

Well that's the thing, I don't know where to start, and I'm not. Not until I have an understanding of what I will get myself into. Do you have any links for beginners you would suggest reading?
Thanks for your advice
