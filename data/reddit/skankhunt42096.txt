Buy when it starts going up, a few 100s will be worth the eventual gain.

I did too, when it went to 17k and starting dipping down again I sold it 12k(at loss, obviously). But now I can buy for much lower

Sorry I didn't say it right, I meant as in what's going on in the video? Why are they dumping it?

What's does "garbage money" mean here? It must have some value right?

Just curious, and I can't seem to find anything about it. How did you actually use, buy, sell bitcoin when it was young and cheap, were there already wallets available? If not then how did you turn real money into bitcoin?

I'm trying to get a wallet(have my eyes on electrum). But are mobile app wallets safe, or should I stick with desktop wallet. What's the best place and way to buy?

Man being a guy who hasn't started working yet I always told my mom and bro to buy bitcoins since the past year.
Now I'm thinking I'm just gonna put all the money I have to buy btc. But I'm really confused if I should just buy or wait for a dip in price as there has always been one after a surge.

Just his married life and SOs. He's good with his kids and I appreciate that.

That's true. But what do you expect when wife's of billionaires pretend to love them. A toxic marriage is not better than a divorce. A divorce is always an end of a "bad marriage".

The value has crashed 30% in india since this post was up.
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:57:26
You can just transfer it to an offshore exchange or any other non indian wallet

Can someone actually explain to me how is that the value has crashed here in India?
Even if there are problems in anyway the trade of crypto seems to be going fine, shouldn't the value be almost similar to the actual value?
