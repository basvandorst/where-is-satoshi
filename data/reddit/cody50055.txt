I mean, I dont feel we personally have to fear the US banning it after the revenue in taxes its been generating. However if it does, I know there are people like me who will continue to use it thanks to how well spread out our community is across the globe and because of the underlying values that orginally got us interested.  It might scare off people only invested for its monetary value, the people who just want to get rich; however I highly doubt anyone invested for its intrinsic value will be significantly weavered by such a decision.

Core.  Anything else is a gamble imho

It doesnt, same as when China bans it.  This increases demand and value. Governments fearing bitcoin = further proof of its utility.

Unfortunately no, the original btc tipbot is defunct and I think it is unlikely you can still claim that tip.  However I honestly hope someone else can come thru and help you

But this hasn't been anything of a quick rise compared to any other time we've broke $1k. This has been by far the most gradual and sustained rise from 1-1.2k, imopo

Well from my perspective this has still been the least abrupt rise past $1000, compared to any of the others. Guess we can agree to disagree

Thanks! The more people we have running full nodes the more secure the blockchain is

Doing my part to help secure the blockchain, that's about it.

Proud full node runner since 2011, we have a bright future ahead of us my friends. Putting some control back into the hands of the people is long overdue
