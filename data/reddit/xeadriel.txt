Gold doesn’t jump around like that. Gold is actually known to be quite steady when it comes to its price

Feeling sorry for you bro that’s all I can say
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:27:22
Indeed it is
@_date: 2019-07-19 16:05:14
I mean yeah it does move around a bit. But it doesn’t double or triple all of a sudden. I’d say bc of that the comparison is quite a bit off

Let them talk. The more people believe in such crap and gamble on it the more earnings for us long term investors. Easy :)

Wouldn’t buy shit from Facebook unless I have to.

Uhm alright thanks for telling me stuff I already know?  A fabulous week for you too?  I wasn’t criticizing bitcoin. I was criticizing the comparison
@_date: 2019-07-06 08:22:49
Didn’t happen to me yet.

Ignored because it doesn’t support his thesis
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:18:28
What a bullshit. You should’ve just fled yeah..

With the wild assumption it became the only way of payment it’d be better than starving than refusing to use it though x.x
@_date: 2019-10-21 22:10:29
But why in English
@_date: 2019-10-21 12:49:31
run by bitcoin doesnt even make sense if you know what bitcoin is ahaha. what are they gonna report next? 300 drug sellers arrested run by dollar? even if bitcoin was centralized this doesnt make any sense xD

im sorry to disappoint you but there lots of people who arent interested in english and just barely know it or are just from older generations nobody really taught them. for instance i live in germany so its not that far off and they are quite a few ppl who dont speak english or dont want to speak english and even my parents dont really speak english. often its these people who respond very conservatively against new tech (such as bitcoin in this case) and it would be wise to especially teach those people what it actually is that they are critisizing bc they dont really bother looking these up. it just doesnt make much sense to intentionally write these in english instead of the foreign language. it just slows the knowledge spread.

It’s still a German speaking country. Most people won’t bother reading stuff in English. If that’s aimed to inform the general audience this should’ve been in German
@_date: 2019-10-22 11:45:15
I don’t know where you live but it’s quite possible to live a whole life without needing to learn English at all. But if I had to guess you’re in an natively English-speaking country. It’s easy to pass school with barely learning any English. And overtime these people forget the rest few things they did learn and keep things their language.
@_date: 2019-10-22 07:51:39
Lol yes I know. That’s not the point. It’s still a fact that most people in a not natively English speaking country won’t bother trying to read this. It just addresses less people. It’s like addressing a minority when your actual goal is to make it popular overall
@_date: 2019-10-22 11:00:40
That doesn’t even make any sense. Some people just want things to be in their language. Also some people need things to be in their language first before they potentially give up refusing information. If you offer information for free and without effort more people will read it. Isn’t that the whole point of this kind of ad? Spreading awareness?  Why would you do that in a foreign language? world language or not not everyone is fluent in it
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:08:16
Sounds plausible

seems like he had too much money and time on his account
@_date: 2019-12-31 15:40:26
nice i would like to see that youtube video xD
wouldve followed along with that idiot
@_date: 2019-09-16 21:50:09
What the hell is this stupid bullshit they are pulling. I hope you’ll get through this fine that’s just not fair
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:47:06
It’s a me, Mario
