Does anyone know of a good info-graphic or anything for storing your Bitcoin? i would be willing to make one if anyone is interested in something like that.

It would be cool to have some sort of program that prints off a transaction from the blockchain. I dunno how it would work but you could maybe tie it with this app or the blockchain and then have it tied to what you purchased. Just brainstorming here people.

just another reason the government will go after bitcoin....

Perhaps. But doesn't it sort of compete with Google wallet? Perhaps they will integrate it into Google Wallet

Yeah or use a VPN maybe. Cavirtex actually has really good security for this. You are not allowed to withdraw coins if you are outside of Canada no matter what I am pretty sure. So from a security standpoint it makes sense. But i feel like maybe if the deposit IP is the same as the withdraw one it should be okay. I would be willing to help anyone out if they need Bitcoins to get moved...

Oh Okay. Yeah i have my wallet.dat on a thumb drive encrypted with truecrypt. I have about 20 bucks just in multibit with a password. May use a paper wallet because they looks cool

android is ridden with malware. i dont think it is fair for you to make a claim like this and disregard android's flaws

will you make it so you can choose the exchange it displays?
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:41:53
no one is going to give you coins unless you have a legitimate proposal. Ever heard of kickstarter? if you make a post on there you see guys with videos and have proof they arent going to take money and run. since youve used this reddit account for a few years i believe you... but still.

doesnt apple have access to these things as well?

I laminated my paper wallet. Got a laminator and the plastic for 30 bucks. Worth it if you have a lot of coin

teach me!

its also good because i hope this crash scared a lot of people who wouldnt be dedicated to bitcoin anyways and just wanted to cash in. its people like us in this community that keep bitcoin alive. i still feel sorry for anyone who lost boatloads of money, because thats always shitty. Im not worried about bitcoin as long as silk road is alive and well. BITCOIN IS THE FUTURE DAMMIT!

Question 5: how much money is in YOUR bank account? you shouldn't be asking people this  because its not exactly respectful. I believe you are asking because you want to know how much Bitcoin you should get? If that is the case then it's based on how much you are willing to risk/spend online. If you want a quick buck then only a few I would say (but what do I know? I've gone through two damn pump and dumps and made zero) but if you want to use it for legitimate transactions that is based on your shopping expenditures and habits

You may not even need the differet adresses. Isnt it possible just to get them to leave a note with the transfer that has their email and what game they want? Or does that require a manual search for what they want and who they are? You are already processing the steam gifting manually...

its weird how its not searched in china as much as is in USA when im being told how popular it's getting there.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:04:44
I would think so, but i believe that there are already tons of people doing the same thing in regards to showing people how to save their wallets. What i want to start doing is start a group where  you send your bitcoin investments to and the Bitcoin wallet keys are engraved onto platinum slates, to be delivered to you. that would be badass. that way we dont have to hear more horror stories of people losing their wallets or forgetting passwords
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:52:05
hahah no i get it! we all love a good underdog story!!!
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:15:18
i want to start up a site to post classifieds for things that people are selling and want bitcoin for. i believe a lot of people want something like this.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:47:24
i bought mine at 60 so im not too worried. maybe next time ill be one of these pump and dumpers and ruin what i think bitcoin should be: a damn currency. i didn't learn last time in Q2...
EDIT: Happy Cakeday...

paypal starts using bitcoins. all current website using paypal start accepting bitcoins. bitcoin value increases 100 fold. bernie madoff invests in it. obama replaces federal reserve with a massive mining operation/  the seized silk road assets. bitcoin is ruined by US government which now controls all mining operations.
But in all seriousness:i believe that we will begin getting support from governments because they will want to start taxing it now that stories are coming out of people making so much money. We will then get in an argument on whether bitcoin is a stock or a currency; does it count as capital gains and how should it be taxed. Then we will see from there... but i have no idea where it will go from here :)

that's a good point. i guess as people start to set up more specialized mining rigs, it would be harder to take over that 51% majority that a gov (or i guess anyone) would try and take so they have significant control
