Whats the point for random people like me, who only own a personal computer, to mine Bitcoins if chinese dudes with thousands of computers mine 24/7 ?
I don't see the advantage of giving into Bitcoins at this point, it would be a waste of time.
Am I wrong ? Why ? How would it be profitable for someone like me ?

Ok, I see.
Well I guess that would be a waste of time in my case.
It's more about people wanting to get away from national currency than anything else at this point.
Thanks for all the answers !

Thats a great explanation.

Getting paid in bitcoin would make it pretty tough to survive I guess ?
Not sure, but where I live my landlord wont accept Bitcoins for sure, same for my supermarket.

Thanks for taking the time to explain all this to me, that was very interesting.
Well, even if I wanted to work hard to make coins, it would be impossible in my country at this point. Electricity bills would ruin me and cost of a farm is out of reach in my financial state.
But the people who invented this are geniuses, I have to admit it's really smart.

That answers my questions, thanks.
So if I understand well, people buy Bitcoins and use the market to generate money by selling/buying when it's most profitable, correct ?

How expensive is it at the moment ? I mean, a bitcoin ?
