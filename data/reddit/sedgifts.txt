I think it’s $6.20 for shipping and handling a piece.  So two would be $12.  Just got an order for two to CA and my USPS cost from Cleveland was $11.80, so I think my charge is right in line. They’re heavy duty glasses so there is some weight to them unfortunately (and fortunately because no one wants a cheap glass) . About a pound a piece.

There are some terms misapplied. Stock splits and printing money have nothing in common. One gives you twice the Amount of shares worth exactly half of the value (same net value) , and printing money is pure dilution (theoretically less value) . You could say printing money is similar to new stock issuance.  Both dilute the value of the asset.

Never is a long time. Vanguard is famous for having the lowest fees in the industry in their index funds, Tough to see them ever becoming an early adapter for that reason alone.

I just got these decanters in so I haven’t listed on Amazon or Etsy yet.  If interested I could make a custom listing or could sell cheaper directly for Crypto (for crypto $25 for decanter and 2 glasses plus $9 shipping in US. )

I’ll cut a break in shipping for multiple orders, just let me know total number of glasses, designs, and zip code and I’ll set up a personalized listing with a leveraged shipping cost.  Thanks!
