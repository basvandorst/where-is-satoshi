No, I only used the account to log in, trade actively, withdraw and log out- never kept coins there. It's not the coins being gone that's the weird part, because I can see where they went. It's my entire trade history for the day (5-6 trades) being gone, and that bit coin address that once was linked to my account lo longer being linked to my account that is the weird part.

super annoying, I'm stuck in LTC until it's figured out. Not where I wanted to be...oh well

no 2FA, but the weird thing is the history- my transaction history is now only current to 11/19/13, and I've made 5 or 6 trades today (which showed up previous to being logged out). So it's leading me to believe this is a bug of some sort

I had never heard of the sheep market website until the hack made the news, and I've never used or logged on to it. Even now I don't know the URL

BTC-e just emailed me this morning in response to my findings (I also sent them proof that I've posted in this thread). 
They sent a one sentence response: "your account is only tied to these two wallet addresses: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxxx" 
...Not exactly the response I'd expect after telling a Bitcoin exchange that their website might have been infiltrated by one of the largest hackers in Bitcoin history. 
My mac is not infected with anything. I've heard in another thread that this happened to others on BTC-e. My best bet is either the hacker has tried to hack btc-e and only partially succeeded, or someone at BTC-e is in on this. But who knows, all I know is that BTC-e is seemingly unwilling to help with anything and I do not have the technical knowledge to investigate further. I just wish this got more visibility- seems a few other people have had this happen to them as well.

Thank you! How do I sign a message? I'm not sure how to do that

yes, I'm sure. I always check the URL. The website functioned *perfectly* while I was trading, including troll box. There aren't any phishing sites that do that. It probably is some sort of phishing-type hack, but following my coins proves it's being done by the people behind the sheep market hack
Edit- I'm also on a mac, not PC. Not sure if that makes any difference to ya

I was trading on BTC-E all day, so unless they redirected it to an exact mirror of BTC-E with the same login, same URL, and a trade-able interface, I don't see how that part was a hack. But I'm not very knowledgable, so it could be possible?
