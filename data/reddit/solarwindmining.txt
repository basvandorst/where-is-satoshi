Hello! This is James, the President of SolarWind Mining. There are 30 30GH/s and a handful of 1GH/s left in the store. We are almost completely funded. If we sell the rest of the shares before the Neptunes sell out, we're good to go!

uhhhh.. I get that, what I don't get is why SehHadManHands thinks its appropriate for SehHadManHands to offer an opinion telling me that I had no business offering an opinion, but then again, SehHadManHands is free to offer their opinion, but then again, so are you, then again, so am I.

I don't understand your point. If you don't think it is any of my business, what makes you think its any of yours. Yet you have taken the time to read about it and offer your own opinion, which is the exact same thing I have done. So I am confused about your statement. I'll rephrase my perception of your reply to illustrate my point:
"In all honesty, it was my opinion. What business is it of yours or anyone else's what I do? Took a shot and got a reply from you. Oh yeah!!!  :P

Maybe so, but that doesn't negate my point.

How foolish, here I am trying to gather investors so that we can create a Company that will care about its investors and we have people who just give away millions for the thrill of the risk of all but certain lose!

With bitcointalk.org down you might be getting a little bored, so why don't you visit the company website and start creating some content of your own?
