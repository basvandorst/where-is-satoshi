I might be happier if I never took out another loan!

I accidentally upvoted this from 33 to 34. What have I done!?!?!?

Yeah, I was only doing the math for American borrowers. That staggering 1.4 trillion in American student loan debt got me thinking. If we could somehow convince everyone to put that money in cryptos, there might be enormous growth potential for bitcoin.

Wow!  Funny enough, I'm an American living in Thailand and I've met loads of other Americans here that have given up on their loans. I'm still paying, but I've decided to put less into loans and more into cryptos. With my interest rate and low payments I feel I'm trying to move a mountain with a spoon! Maybe cryptos will be my salvation lol

Oh,  sorry for the dumbassery, thanks for the clarification and sorry if any of this sounds like a suggestion. Actually, I'm still paying my loans, but I've dropped the payment back to the minimum to buy some bitcoin instead with the hope that I might actually have a chance of paying the debts with the profits. Right now the debt seems insurmountable and it feels like money is better placed in bitcoin, but of course it's a gamble. Anyway, wouldn't the demand of all the people buying bitcoin cause the price to increase significantly? I have no idea what sort of math could be done to calculate the price under that scenario.

Edit: OK,  this is my original math and it is shit and it's probably not a good idea to default and destroy your credit score and risk garnished wages. But out of sheer speculation, does anyone have any idea how much the price of bitcoin could rise under this scenario? 
44 million borrowers * $200 median monthly student loan payment = 8.8 billion dollars each month. 
The bitcoin market cap is $67.6 billion today.
8.8 billion * 8 = 70.4 billion, which means that if all borrowers started transferring their payments to bitcoin the price would more than double in 8 months,  triple in 16, quadruple in 24 and so forth. 
In that sense, the first investment would be worth 4 times as much in 2 years. And every monthly investment from then until 8 months would be worth at least double.
I know that this doesn't take into account the complexities of the market, but it does seem like our money would be better placed in bitcoin than in student loan payments.
