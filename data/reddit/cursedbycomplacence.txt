So here's my question. Why wouldn't banks get together and create their own blockchain where each bank runs their own "mining" rig which performs the calculations to secure/verify the ledger between each other?
They could even standardize the requirements of the mining system since they don't really need coins as a reward.  They only really need decentralization among themselves, not every individual in the world.  This way, all of the information would be kept "in-house" which I figure is what they want.  It keeps their value to customers similar to what it is right now while increasing their internal efficiency.
The public probably wouldn't care because most don't pay that close of attention.  The biggest problem with this idea would be getting all of the banks on the same standard.

I agree with you on all of that.  However, I don't think it relates well to email because I think that banks want their system to remain behind the scenes as it is now.  We don't interact with their settlement system.  For instance, when transferring money, we just inform them what we want to do and then they do it behind the scenes with a system that's less efficient than it appears to the consumer.
I imagine them looking a separate banking blockchain as a way to keep their services the same while being internally more efficient.  They don't want people to look at banks differently.
Although you may be right in the long term because maybe a huge decentralized public system would reap some other sort of benefit for them, but I doubt that's how they're looking at it right now.

I'm saying that every bank would run what is essentially a miner.  They don't need rewards because that's not their incentive.  They can all just run an agreed upon system.  The difficulty wouldn't even ever need to increase.  In fact, in such a closed system, you'd want each bank to possess equal hashing power.  In essence each bank would run this pseudo miner just to independently verify the blockchain between each other.
We're looking at it like independent citizens/consumers but they don't care about a truly decentralized system.  They just want a more efficient settlement platform that enables them to maintain their current relevance.

Why would all of the other banks allow that? What I mean to say is that the same thing that stops a miner from doing it now would stop any one rogue bank from doing it.
I'm honestly asking because i'm saying that each bank would be acting as a decentralized miner in my scenario.

I know that it isn't really decentralized, i'm saying banks don't care if it is decentralized.  Sure they can collude or be corrupted but that's all true now and a majority of the public doesn't care.  I'm asking why they should give a fuck about using the Bitcoin blockchain when it seems to me that they'd prefer their own.  That's why when I read these stories, I don't find it very exciting because I can't imagine them ever using Bitcoin.

There would still be difficulty, it would just stay flat for the most part.  Only affected by banks joining or leaving the system.  Otherwise it would just plug along at a relatively consistent hashrate.  Of course collusion or the malice of a central authority is a problem, but that's a problem now and they get away with it.
Also, i'm not arguing that I like this idea.  I'm just saying that this is sort of what I would expect to play out.

How many are lost already and how many will be lost by the time all are mined? I'd wager it'll be a significant amount. I'm sure solutions will arise which make it harder for the average person to fuck up, but it's still likely to be an issue.

I work for a Fortune 500 company where a large portion of the skilled workers are paid by the minute.  It is tracked through the computer system which we log in and out of on our own accord. 
The policy is to log out if you're breaking for more than 20 minutes but it's not really enforceable so I have no idea what other people are doing.  It appears that it's more for record keeping and accounting as they never bust our balls about it.
That said, our pay is still a weekly direct deposit.  It's weird checking my account and getting random amounts of money each week.

Checks are generally awful but i'm surprised that your wife can't deposit it.  I deposit checks made out to my wife all of the time.  Just write "For Deposit Only" on the back.  I'm guessing NZ has different rules.

We can tip him a few bucks.  Think that'd help?

Isn't speaking with businesses that deal in that sector an important part of "filling in your knowledge gaps"?  They should get their knowledge from all possible sources.  I wouldn't expect them to just read reddit and wikipedia.

Isn't Forbes basically just a blog with independent contributors? I haven't read the article in question but why would anyone trust Forbes on anything? It isn't journalism. It's clickbait lists and shit for wannabe hedge fund managers.

The oddest part off that episode for me was that at one point Adams chastises Harris for speculating about what Trump's true intentions are. Yet Adams' entire position is based on him speculating about Trump's true intentions.
