Good advice.
I'm not American, so I'm not familiar with your regulator bodies. BBB is what I always hear on Dateline or 20/20 or whatever.

Dear FirstTrust,
I respectfully, yet firmly, ask you to cease and desist any future demands and/or recommendations as to where I spend any money which I have deposited in your institution.
Should you choose to make these inappropriate requests again, I will require one of the following;
1) A civil or federal criminal charge(s) against said company I wish to transfer my funds to, including proper legal citations from your general counsel or,
2) A criminal conviction of said company and its employees, including proper legal citations from your general counsel.
Should either of these two requirements not be fulfilled, I will immediately and permanently close my account with FirstTrust and draft the balance into whichever banking institution is you highest competitor. Depending on the degree in which you make any future inappropriate and unqualified demands, I will also reserve the right to submit complaints with the Better Business Bureau and appropriate consumer watch-dog media outlets.
Please respond in under 30 days with a confirmation and acceptance of these terms, from both the head of your Operations Risk Management Department and your general counsel.
EDIT: some spellin'
