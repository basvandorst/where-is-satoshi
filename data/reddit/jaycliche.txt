I'm a US citizen and I turned to bitcoins to bypass "capitalist" banking controls.  AKA "Americans turn to bitcoins to bypass "capitalist" banking controls.

I'm glad this is up.  Those guys gave me a bad feeling.   was something someone posted yesterday. Tried it and went great.  Basically just a deposit into a wells fargo price.  Paid for what wasn't much more than current trading high.  I don't work for them, just thought I'd share.

I agree but the point that they ARE using the word coins I thought was a bit of a big deal, as it could potentially rebrand bitcoin to be thought more of as a gift card and dilute the BTC 'brand'

I remember a similar conversation pre yahoo and google.  They picked memorable names, and look what happened!  Slushies it great but they should have that as their domain or at least a forward!

Jeez, you wouldn't know it from the recent prices!

Funny and good point, but I don't think they equate.  They aren't Amazon 'Dollars' though so I'm thinking there were some marketing decisions bad, based on the recent news about BTC, to try to imitate.

I think MT Gox should hire

Seems more like PayPal recognizes that some people recognize Bitcoin as a form of money, and it's more a marketing/policy issue.

Sorry Sgt Repost.  I hadn't seen it posted yet and reddit didn't tell me it had been posted.  Thanks for your repost vigilance.

"Defense" nuts constantly making threats...surprise.  I guess terror is part of defense

You know even  has been up and down today...I'm guessing (and many have pointed to other evidence) that this isn't simply MtGox's problems

God I hate Ebay, and I hope the founders spaceship crashes into him.

Is your boss also gonna pay you in BTC?
