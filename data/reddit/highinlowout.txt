You don't get the loan for free, you have to back it with a "margin". So, imagine you short sell 1 BTC at $10k, and you have $5k in your account. The platform lends you 1 BTC. You sell it for $10k so your account is now worth $15k (but you can't access it - it's locked as a security for the 1 BTC).
If the market moves in your favor (goes down), you buy back for instance at $6k, and your account is now worth $9k, and unlocked.
If the market moves against you (goes up), as soon as it reaches $15k, the platform will buy back 1 BTC for $15k - your account gets liquidated and you lose the initial balance. Or maybe you "stop loss" at $13k - losing $3k of your initial balance.
This is just a simplified view of the mechanics behind margin trading. The actual math gets more complicated.
Edit: In my opinion, margin trading is pure gambling because you can be forced out of the market in the worst moment. If you just buy and sell what you own, you keep control.

Buying in after an exceptional growth period is risky. A huge dip is possible and yes, it might stay low for months. It might never grow again. There are no guarantees.
You basically made a bet. The only thing you have to ask yourself is: am I comfortable waiting a long time for my bet to work out? Am I comfortable if it doesn't work out? Do I have enough funds so I won't be forced to sell at a low price in order to pay my bills?
If it is "no" to any of those three questions, you should use the fact that you can currently sell without loss, and adjust your bet until all three answers are "yes". Then you can go buying small amounts over time, instead of one huge amount all at once, always keeping in mind those questions.
This is not financial advice.
@_date: 2018-08-15 11:24:22


Right. But it's asymmetric - from 4000, it has to climb 400% to get back to the ATH, not 80%. That's why it usually takes month to go down and years to climb up.
But I think it will get back there eventually.

Of course. It's supposed to take month. Using 3 reliable fiat gateways, you can transfer out about 10k-20k per day without hassle (not my ballpark, unfortunately), and much more if you submit to extended KYC.

Well 100% is a theoretical maximum unreachable and probably exponentially difficult to approach, as shorts have to be closed at some point in order to pay back the short-sold coins so the buying pressure goes up when the price goes down... I was short trading this shit show for a while from 15k to 6k, got the timing wrong a few times with the rallies and made very little money from it overall.
@_date: 2019-03-30 22:14:42
Come on, of course there are reasons to sell. Want to by a house and the owner wants dollars not bitcoin? Just one of many examples why you would need to exchange. Basically, every time you want to buy something from someone who doesn't accept bitcoin.

The problem with %% in market is, you need more to go up than to go down. The crash from 6000 to 3000 was "only" 50% - and 50% up from 3000 takes us to 4500 only. So when he talks about 40% bear, that's much more bear than 40% bull is bull.

Not sure if I am following you? After shorting 6K in November, you had plenty of time to settle for at good profit, right? Even if you don't want to close now because your plan is to wait for further lows, you can stop loss at 4.5k, and exit with some profit.
Of course, if you don't have a plan or don't execute it or start moving the stop loss goalposts, then you're fucked. If you are unable to have a plan and stick to it, then you shouldn't be doing this. Specially in profit zone.

Because it's not arbitrage, it's speculation (to take this gap, you speculate that USDT, a cryptocoin that happens to trade near 1,0 USD most of the time, resumes trading at 1,0 USD in the near future.
Arbitrage traders don't speculate, they take immediate profits (not entirely true, they indeed do speculate that the order book they are looking at is still the same when their order hits the market, in other words, they speculate that they will be fast enough to make the trade profitable).
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:58:30
Well, BTC is trading at 6500 on real-dollar exchange cex, and almost 7000 at tether exchanges. Since you can't buy anything with tether (besides some shitcoins maybe), the real-dollar price is what we all care for.
PS: on Kraken, where you can trade USDT for USD, Tether is currently sold at 0.92 USD each USDT... and dipped as low as 0.85 USD/USDT a few hours ago. So there definitely is some panic potential in the market regarding Tether :)

Come on, that stupid prediction already busted - he clearly said **"after that we will slowly rise and rise"** \- nope, **we went parabolic to 14k** followed by a dip of 5k and that guy did not predict ANY of that. July touched as low as 9.0k and as high as 13.1k. 9.2k is just a random number within that range. Big deal. So maybe the close? Nope, closed at 10k. And the open? Nope, opened at 10.8k. The low? Nope ...
So nope, this is just the random prediction which had to get it right - statistically some predictions have to get it right, and you are just falling by the survivor bias or something like that.
Edit: typo
@_date: 2019-10-14 16:22:55


Which would ultimately mean that "real" attacks as per your definition would be indistinguishable from real blocks -&gt; their blocks must be real blocks -&gt; the only possible "real" attack would be to find a way to compute blocks in substantially less time, or compute blocks analytically (almost instantly) -&gt; this is impossible unless the attacker knows something the whole world's math science community doesn't know -&gt;  so "sophisticated enough" doesn't really cut it ...
Anyway, that "bitcoin under attack" is obviously bullshit, probably just some programmer testing their custom implementation.
@_date: 2019-10-01 09:21:17
The big problem is to identify a swing beforehand. Let me tell you, it's almost impossible or maybe it's impossible. So if you are good, you maybe win 6 out of 10 swing trades, and make a loss in 4. In order to get an edge out of this, you have to do a lot of math.
What you can do is to say something like this: wow, this went up to 12k from 3k in no time, I think it's time to take some profit - maybe 25%, 30% or something. If it goes down, I reinvest some of that profit. If it goes up. I'll just enjoy my profit and ride it with the remaining coin I still have.

On 02 Apr 2019 a few players placed large buy orders all over the exchanges, moving the price from \~4k to \~5k. So yes, you are right, it involves " buying bitcoin for 1k more than it's worth. Not just one bitcoin, but TONS of them."

Next it spikes - holy shit, my total worth is now 90k$, but it's 5k$ in fiat and 85k$ in BTC - I have to sell for a balance at 45k/45k.
Wow, it spikes even more - I am now at 200k$, but it's 45k$ in fiat and 155k$ in BTC - I have to sell for a balance at 100k/100k.
Shit, huge crash - I am now at 140k$, but it's 100k$ in fiat and 40k$ in BTC - I have to buy for a balance at 70k/70k.
Wow, another huge spike - I am now at 350k$ but it's 70k in fiat ... etc ...

You don't have a credit card nor do you know how it works right? When I use my credit card I am fully backed and secured against any kind of fraud. You just have to check your balance sheet monthly, and if you see someone is stealing from your credit card account, you call your bank and they charge it back fully, with zero fees for you.
So no, it's not crazy to use a credit card. Use this as a rule of thumb: things billions of people all over the world do on a daily basis are usually not crazy.

Look, you don't do that. You instruct your bot to start buying by taking the lowest asks in the order book. You adjust the bot to just buy enough to get for example 10 points per minute up.
Phase 2: once the price is up 1% or 2%, you start to use the coins you bought and sell by taking the highest bids in the order book. You are already making profit. Of course you continue to buy at a higher rate at the ask side of the order book.
Phase 3: the up trend gains momentum. So now you start to lower the buy rate and increase the sell rate.
Phase 4: you stop buying, but the momentum is still there. So you start to make sell orders in the book, instead of taking buy orders.
Phase 5: you start selling aggressively everything you didn't already sell dureing the pump. this is the dump.
The End: you now have more fiat **and** more bitcoin than in the beginning.

Holy fuck!
I would start using some rallies that bring me above a certain price to average down my buying price some more.
For example: 10% of my stock are 20% above buying price (like from 3.7k to 4.4k). So I sell those 10%. What can really happen:
1) Price never goes down again - patience, I still take 90% of my investment to the moon
2) Price drops again - I rebuy and made a good deal.
And I'd invest the remainder of the transaction in other assets, because seriously, your portfolio needs diversification.

I must say, I admire you for your stance. And I really hope bitcoin works out. But since almost all product prices are pegged to fiat currencies, euro in your case, I guess your income in BTC varies with the bitcoin price. I mean you probably earn a fixed euro amount converted in BTC at the end of the month's rate, right? Doesn't mean that's bad, but it's different from a fixed income in BTC.

Problem is, the price is wearing off the support. Support is nothing magic, it's just a place where enough buyers are waiting to hold the price. Each time the price hits the support, more of those buyers are satisfied. The support wears off. Same for the resistance levels, but instead of buyers, it's sellers.
Don't know if there is any support here though. Volume is very low.

Yes, if you are fully aware of the risk that the asset you are trying to sit through might become worthless instead of going up again. I  doubt many people here take that risk serious.

You can easily check your argument yourself. Find some historical bitcoin graph. Zoom to 24h view and move into the past.

I think you will see that the last 24h give a poor prediction for what is coming.

What about absurd high price predictions based on nothing? I am pessimistic, and I do think it will go down to absurd price levels. It's a market and it will try to squeeze coins out of hodlers. A lot of hodlers will break if it goes deep enough, and the market knows that. What the fuck is going on here? If you are holding for 50k or 100k, then why does it matter if it's 8000 or 8500 today? Just put your coins in a wallet where you can't panic sell them, and take a look at the price every 3 month. Really.

Do yourself a favor and use DCA properly - also selling when you can (means when at profit), not only buying. Sell at a target, or use a trailing stop loss. It's hard to know when to sell. So what can happen?
- You sell and it goes up: sucks, but you sold at profit. Subtract that profit from your total cost will still lower your average cost. You still hold your original investment. You are good.
- You sell and it goes down: Subtract that profit from your total cost and repeat...
- You don't sell and it goes further down: worst case...
- You don't sell and it goes up: now that would be perfect. But it doesn't always happen.

No, it's not. Tether is an altcoin just as so many others out there. It's proprietary, it's centralized. In this subreddit, you call most of them shitcoins, but you trust this one. Why?


The big players in the market are well aware that USDT is a crypto coin worth just as much as the issuing company' word for it. They accept the 1:1 arbitrage for now because it's convenient for them, because they are gambling and because they have their risk calculation done, contrary to most of the people in here. When - or if - the tether shit hits the fan, they will be the first selling off USDT fast as hell. At this time, crypto might spike to the moon at USDT exchanges, and simultaneously crash into hell at USD exchanges. We'll see.
But hey, yeah maybe Tether really is the multi-billion company they claim to be, without giving any proof whatsoever. Then everything is fine.

I don't know if the US Gov can actually enforce such a shutdown for USA customers, the USA are not Zimbabwe, such an attempt by the government would immediately suffer huge backfire from courts, congress, state governments and what not.
But let's assume the US government actually succeeds and the internet goes down for US customers. Well, that would not shut down "the" internet, just a significant portion of the internet, but "the" internet would just carry on in the rest of the world, it was designed to be resistant against failure of huge parts of it.

So here is my (not so serious) take: when even the amateur league at the bitcoin sub starts to talk about shorting, it's time to close any short position you might have.
EDIT: to answer your question: what you are wishing for is a resistance, not a support, and a bounce to a lower price than what you sold. I personally think 8150 will be reached again. It may take hours, days or weeks, or I might be plain wrong. We will see.

I just would recommend nobody to sink ~$20k into bitcoin based on corrupt cabal satanic 2020 sacrifice, if it takes you a considerable amount of time (1 month or more) to earn that money.
Everything is going down, so, seriously: if your target is 250k, then why would you buy now? Buying now would make sense if your target was anything below 50k. If your target is 250k, you better sit and wait for the ATH of 20k to be confirmed in some strong uptrend?  Just do the fucking math.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:52:48
Here's my take on months and years: we are on the descending side of a giant bubble which took off of $1k early last year. Taking a sustained growth of 100% per year, which seems quite generous to me, this bubble will have to correct to $3k until the end of this year or $4k until the end of next year, not without taking a dip way below those values. 
This doesn's mean the bubble isn't good for yet another bull trap this year. It doesn's even mean the last bull trap is over. 
Of course, I might be totally wrong. But this is my honest opinion.

Every single asset in the world is being traded at a daily base. That's not killing the assets. Day traders cancel each other out - some buy, some sell, some win, others lose, the sum is roughly zero.
Bitcoin is not being killed. It's being corrected heavily from the 2017 bubble and once that's done - by the end of this year maybe - it hopefully will continue to grow.

Look, after the first deep correction to 6k, when bitcoin was making it's 10k and 12k rallies back in the beginning of the year, I was here to warn people against investing recklessly because I thought there was a high probability the crash would continue.
Then, when the dips came, I always backed out because hey what's the point. Beating a man lying on the ground? I don't do that, and it certainly is not my way of "having my day". Alias, when the "coiners" were having "their day", they were having it rightfully in their own forum.

So you take profit at +/- $100 which is hardly 1% today. Then you talk about making $100 a trade, that would be $10k each position. "Split your money in 10 parts", at 10k each part that's $100k you are talking about. And 10k locked in for each hanging close. I call bullshit.

Best case: a few years from now lambo vendors start accepting bitcoin at 0.01 BTC per lambo.
Worst case: a few years from now the bitcoin ledger is a dead monolithic multi-giga blob only interesting for data archeologists.
Mid term: Bitcoin can overcome this bubble without too much damage and continue growing at a reasonable pace.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:43:54
Yes, if it goes back to $1k you better relax. Because prices move by percent, not fixed values. So, at $1k, the swings will be an order of magnitude smaller, for instance $30-$50 instead of $300 - $500.
So the last two runs from 10k to 11.6k will then be like from 1k to 1.16k.
Hasn't to go that low though. But could. And if so, you will have to wait for the next exponential run. Can take months, can take years. Nobody knows.

Despite already getting downvoted for my educated post, which tells me a lot about some of those "smart" and "insightful" "actual" people supposedly posting this morning, I'd like to add the following:
You all agree with the general advice to not invest more into bitcoin than what you can afford to lose. So why is that? Wouldn't such an advice make no sense, or better, wouldn't such an advice be outright wrong, if there was no real danger of total loss? And I mean total loss, not just having to wait ten years for some profits to return.
I hope the best for bitcoin, I think it's awesome. But I do not discard the risk that bitcoin, or blockchain as a whole might not succeed.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:16:35
People just don't want to hear that kind of advice. Bitcoin high? Ridiculous. I am buying dips right now. Well not me. I am short and I will buy THE dip, if it comes. If not, well no problem.

I personally think we did not yet hit the bottom, but don't hold me responsible if I fail.
Having said that, even if I am right it might take days or weeks until the current retracement is finished. It might approach 9k or 10k, or it might evolve into a full-fledged bull trap approaching $12k. And it might turn out that I am wrong, and if that happens, I will take a loss.

This is plain wrong. Each wallet is exactly one address. Wallet and address are two words for the same thing. I think you might be confounding exchange accounts with bitcoin wallets. Exchanges might indeed give you several addresses for transactions with your account.
So yes, nobody really knows which of the early addresses (wallets) belong to Satoshi, but odds are high that most of the very first addresses which were never moved do belong to him (or other early adopters who lost their keys...).


This is true. As a matter of fact, you can build a precise graph of every single fraction of a bitcoin from the beginning to now. The graph would have nodes (wallets) and transactions (arrows). 
Imagine you receive 0.5 BTC in your wallet (address), then you send 0.2 BTC to one address and 0.1 BTC to another address. In the graph this would be one arrow going into your node and two arrows out of your node. The complete BTC transaction history can be drawn like this.
So anonymity in BTC is not very strong. As soon as someone (police investigators etc.) can establish that a certain address (wallet) is yours, they can trace all your transactions to and from other wallets. Example: the police discovers that you own address xyz because you payed a pizza with that wallet and they analyzed the pizza shop's transaction history where your name and address is pegged to that transaction because of delivery. They also know that a well-known drug dealer owns address zxy. If there is a transaction of 2.5 BTC from xyz to zxy in the blockchain, then they know you sent money to the drug dealer. Hope you never did that, because this information is there now, and will be there forever. 


No. There is no such thing as single satoshis. If you receive 0.2 BTC and then 0.4 BTC, you will have 0.6 BTC in your wallet, and if you then send 0.1 BTC, there is no way to tell if those 0.1 came from the 0.2 or from the other 0.4, just like in a bank account. There are no coins, just wallets and balances.
 


you can't send BTC to any random number, but if you do send BTC to the wrong address, then it's gone for good, yes. Someone else  will enjoy that coins then, given they didn't lose their keys...

So are you going to sell some and buy it back under 10k then?
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:43:30
I tell you what happens now: since you sold the bottom after 4 consecutive dips (typical move of newcomers), the market will now tease you with bull signals until you can't stand it any more. So after you see 3 or 4 consecutive rallies you will buy back in. At that moment, you lost maybe 10% of your BTC. So you will try to hold now for another 10% up. Maybe you see it going up a little more, maybe not, but then it will start a sharp decline down below your buy-back point. You will have bought the top. It will then continue to fall below your original sell price, leaving you in a state of despair. You won't be able to think rationally and perhaps sell the bottom once again.

Generally, I think above 99% of trading is done by bots, at any time. But what's the difference? Behind each bot, there is someone with the assets. They just don't trade in the browser, they program bots to do the trading. The bots are just executing commands from real persons.

@_date: 2018-03-02 22:04:46
Instead of asking for advice you should do some math. Math like this:
you bought .25 at 14500 = $3600. To earn $1600 at 10k, you have to spend 0.16. You now have 0.09 BTC for $2000.
What can happen?
1) It goes up from 10000, and never ever goes down again. So your break even price would be 2000/.09 = 22.222. A new ATH just to break even. But hey, if you are going to hodl, it's because you believe it will go 50000 anyway. Ok, at 50k you'd have 4500 for .09 (plus 1600 you get now) and 12500 for .25. Big difference.
2) It goes down to let's say 6000. To buy back your .16 you have to spend 6000*.16 = 960. Now you have .25 for $2960. Your new break even price is 11840. Or you buy for the whole 1600, then you have .09 + 1600/6000 = 0.356. At 50k, that's $17800.
So sell or hold? Well it's like in that movie with Schwarzenegger: Do you feel lucky, punk?

I am short since the pump from 9,8 to 10,2. Since I am short, I have to stick with it, it's that easy. So I am opening more short positions on my way up, at certain intervals. I try to hit local highs and when I get a local dip I take it, raising my break even price and freeing assets for the next round. Best so far was from 10,860 down to 10,570 (the sell was perfect, could have bought a little lower). Actually I am fine being short, but of course still in loss zone until it goes down, and I am confident it will.

You can't take advice from here. It's really all just wishful thinking here. Hodlers and long traders wish it up, short traders wish it down.

It's more like: every fucking time the price of bitcoin jumps wildly or crashes the active users go above 10k - it's just people getting excited about price action, normal thing.
And you can't manipulate the price from here. Even if you get to do all subreddit readers to do what you want - and you don't - but even then the volume would be ridiculous low. A few millions $ perhaps.

You trade? If so, then you are such a hypocrite. And if not, then you are in your right to consider them "parasites", but if you think long traders are any different or better, then you just don't get it.
What's the fucking difference between a trader who sells first and buys later, and one who buys first and sells later? I tell you: none. If this goes down the shit hole, the short sellers will actually help you getting the price stable at some point, because yes, at some point they all have to buy bitcoins to pay back the loans, and that's going to be the fight between short sellers: who gets the timing right? And that fight will help stabilize the price while you hodlers just sit on your bags and wait.
About a coming short squeeze, and getting burned: sure, the market might start running the stops, and traders will see their stops getting hit, but if you get liquidated because you sold at margin without stops, then you just deserve it.

Well at least the exchange I was looking at did not have enough volume and stops/calls/panic buys were cascading up to 8500.


Maybe a bit too soon? Whatever, I closed a small short after the prices were calming down at 7.5k (at loss of course) and think we will spend some time &gt; 8k and &lt; 9k. I will follow the price with sell stops and I am quite certain we soon go back &lt; 7k, maybe a week or three...

I think it will test 9k again. The high test at kraken was 9075. Will be interesting to see if the next test goes higher or lower.
I rose my buy stop to 9350 for now. Don't want to be stopped by a fake out just to see it crashing right afterwards (can happen at 9.3 as well, I know, but less likely).

So you want to go on margin because you "believe". Honestly, you should think it over. For example, at what level do you put your stop loss? Or don't you? Are you at least able to calculate where would be your liquidation price?
By the way: if you use BTC as a collateral to trade BTC on margin, shit can hit the fan really quickly as your margin level goes down in some kind of feedback loop when BTC takes one of it's crashes.

Every serious trader benchmarks his P/L against the overall price trade, not against zero.
Btw, there are lot of traders making money this year in bitcoin. And following your benchmark, everybody trading and losing less than 2/3 of his money since December 21 should be considered successful...
Edit: "every single indicator" always lose money, no matter what. That's why you need confluence of several indicators AND you need the right instinct.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:17:21
No doubt. I was actually watching that spike in a self-made chart view that shows me single trades from kraken as dots, one dot per trade. Well kraken spiked up to 8500. I saw huge liquidations happening as spikes of simultaneous trades covering about .25% to .5% of the asks in the order book each spike, and even more. Some spikes could be huge long positions being opened as well, but I doubt that between 8000 and 8500, in that range it should have been mostly shorts closing and liquidations. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:06:38
I think that short rekt event was a bit exaggerated. A lot of shorts are coming down from &gt;10k. Those just hit stops inside the profit range. Those are naturally looking for ways to resume their positions.

Look, I am a programmer. Last summer I engaged into writing a trade bot as a side project. It is a very high frequency scalping bot. It was successful in the bull run from September until mid January. With successful I mean orders of magnitude better than the buy-and-hold benchmark. I had to turn it off for the bear market because it began losing there. I hope I can get it back online once the bull market resumes, until then, I am trading manually.
Now before my bot was successful, I was looking at a losing bot for at least two month in a row before I got all the tuning right. And I am an experienced programmer and an experienced trader. If you tell noobs to "learn a bit of python" and roll their own bot, the result will be a buy-high-sell-low engine. If you don't know that then you are just talking shit in the first place. So don't tell me this never happens. 
And good luck for you too!

Ok, I get it. You pay the difference between buy and sell price on each position you close. If you reinvest, you can't deduct the reinvested amount right away, you have to wait until you close the new position and then deduct losses or pay more taxes. That's correct?
What a fuckup. Say you buy at $500, then sell at $1000 because you expect a drop, and set a buy stop 5% higher. Didn't drop, your buy stop gets executed, and not only do you have to pay $1050 to get back in, but also you now owe $150 tax? On the other side, you need a drop of 15% just to break even in this setup? Fucking unbelievable.
Where I live, you basically pay taxes for the amount you take out, minus the amount you put in. It's declared as income tax.

Now to why I am here? I like bitcoin. And the more people get burnt in this bubble pop, the harder of a time bitcoin will have to come up again. 
Because not everybody FOMOing in now will stay and hodl. Most people will pull out when they start losing. They will take their 5% or 10% loss, walk away and never look back. Yeah, that's good for bitcoin /s
So I think people should also know my pessimistic views. And here is what I think: bitcoin can as easily fall under 7k again as it can continue up and test 11.6k again.

From what I can derive about your background - "studying" the market since April - "never studied" stock - etc., this is my advice:
If you engage in trading now, you **most probably will lose everything** left in the wallet you were trusted with. Sorry. That's reality.
Second: **Don't do anything yourself.** Give advice, and let your parents-in-law decide. If you pretend to know what you are doing and lose their money, they won't forgive you easily.
Third: those are your parents-in-law best options:
- hold crypto and hope for better prices. Tell them they might see the value falling even more before a recovery. Tell them they might have to wait for many years before they can get their money back and some profit. Tell them there is a real risk crypto currencies to become worthless and remain worthless while the world moves on.
- sell everything for USD, take the loss and keep the remains.
I know it's not the advice you were looking for. But it's realistic advice.

2 word transposition can be brute forced in fractions of seconds, and I am pretty sure there are already programs out there simply trying every imaginable combination of transpositions, switches and flips which can possibly be learned by heart, and it won't take a second to list them all.
So your transposing is pretty much useless with a serious thief, might work for an evil relative though - unless they seek advice from a nerd.
Edit: this is what I use for things I need to keep safe: there is that one odd and silly sentence from my very early childhood I know I will never forget because it's burnt into my brain forever. I use that as a passphrase for a modern encryption algorithm. Edit2: of course you need a computer for that, and if you don't trust your internet connected devices, you will need an airgapped device to do the encryption. And make sure your passphrase doesn't get written to the disk, or better, use a device with OS from a RO device and RAM disks. Security is hard. 
Edit3: 


As I wrote above, this is useless because the company holding your transposed phrase is the company holding the faith of your bitcoin. Seriously, encryption by transposing is cracked since the roman empire.
So if you go the route of three separate companies, then split your seed into three junks of equal size and store one junk with each company, if you want to take advantage of paying for 3 companies at all.

So you think there might be some shilling going on here? Like, those guys who caused the sudden spike yesterday are selling today, and looking for buyers?
Maybe. Some of the comments I read here today sound a bit odd.
Again, last years bull market lasted the whole year and there is no reason to believe the bear market is done in 3 month. Unless you don't believe there was a bear market to start with, of course, just a correction down from the peak.
Well I believe there was a bear market, there is a bear market, and this run maybe will go high over the next few weeks, maybe break 10k, I don't know. But I am convinced at the end it's &lt;7k again. And from there... who knows.
Sorry. It's my opinion. I might be wrong, but be careful with your money. If you think it's time to invest, don't invest more than you think you can wait several years for to take profit. And don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

Sentiment is very positive in this thread. Almost euphoric. When euphoric sentiment is reached, it's time to sell. Then wait for r/bitcoin to get depressive, and buy back. Bulletproof get-rich scheme.

I don't blame the victim for the scammers crime. I am trying to tell him to blame himself for the part in the history he is responsible for: trusting that guy giving away months of work without seeing a dime. That's a sound way to approach such a situation as a lesson for the future. I also had to take such lessons in my life, the important thing is to learn and for that you need to know what exactly you have to blame yourself for.
Besides that, I do think he should go after the scammer, but I have the feeling this kind of campaign is a mistake. That's why I suggested him to talk to a lawyer. Might be wrong though.
And this has nothing to do with crypto or coding. I saw this happen long years ago with a friend of mine, an independent truck driver, who drove too much for a customer who didn't pay. In the end he couldn't buy gas anymore or pay the loan for the truck. He was broke. Same story, different business. Happens everywhere.

Prices are ridiculously low for the time being. I don't say it can't go lower in the mid term, but in the short term it's overdue for some serious price action... up, collecting stops and liquidations :)
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:12:35
No, it's not. Just do the math:
ATH 20000 - 85% (17000) = 3000
3000 + 566% (17000) = 20000
So from 20000 down to 3000 it's 85% loss. From 3000 back to 20000 you need 566% gain.
Have a nice day.

Well, thank you for taking the time trying to educate me. But, it just turned out that your analysis was wrong, resistance at 3580 was broken, your 400-600 price drop did not happen and BTC went on and up. Therefore, your explanation is worthless.
Now let's see if it takes us to $4k :)
I totally expect the price to come down again later (hope I am wrong with that).

Do you know how hard it is to get the timing right for shorting? Most of those idiots coming here bragging about their shorting don't know what they are talking about. Especially those who say shorting is easy ...

This is bullshit. Exchanges hold funds in cold storage, so they won't be able to satisfy such a spike. I don't even want to imagine the chaos you are trying to provoke. 
Anyway, I don't think you will get any meaningful traction for this, so yes, go ahead and pay the double fee for nothing...
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:49:09
Well let's all hope not so, because crypto does depend on a functional, open and somewhat free global network to survive, right? It would hardly survive an internet meltdown in an upcoming world war, or am I missing something?

This question comes up millions of times. The added credibility comes from the fact that a new account might just be a throwaway account from someone who got banned for trolling. Older accounts less so.
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:12:53
I don't believe this can get the kind of traction needed to create a meaningful signal. So a bunch of people will pay a lot of fees in order to transfer coins out of the exchange and back into the exchange, and the exchanges will hardly notice any difference.
If not, it would create huge chaos: exchanges do use cold storage, and withdrawals will take days to be processed. 
This makes no sense at all. Nobody needs this.

Stops to protect against large falls? Typically, the market is just gonna touch your stops and then it will rally up again :P
Anyway, if you really want to use this method, you can reduce your third party risk using leveraged stop orders - instead of the full amount to sell, you only have to keep enough funds in the exchange to satisfy margin requirements for your stop margin orders, for instance 20%. If your stops get triggered, you transfer the remaining 80% to the exchange in order to settle the position.

First of all, you have to blame yourself seriously for that situation. You accepted to work for free and a few promises, called the unknown guy a "friend", and got scammed. 
Now that's your history, and of course he will tell another history. Don't think that your history will be the one accepted by the courts, just because it's so obviously true for you. Posting this here and probably in a few more places is making things worse for you. You should be talking to a lawyer. If he fights back this campaign of yours you can get seriously hurt - you are making severe accusations without proof.
Stop this and go talk to a lawyer as soon as possible. 
And even if you can't recover anything: take your loss as a fee for a valuable lesson. You are young and naif, and after analyzing this situation you brought yourself into, you will still be young - and have plenty of time to recover from this - but not so naif any more ... :)
@_date: 2018-12-24 15:20:50
\&gt;  Create a wallet controlled by your phone, your laptop and your spouse's  phone with 2-of-3 multisig. If one of these get stolen, you can still  recover.
Always keep the three devices in different physical locations. If two of them burn with your house, you lose not only your house, but also your money.
\&gt;  Or have a company hold 2 of the 3 keys, one of which they keep offline  on paper. Now when you do transactions, the company will co-sign your  transactions
Sounds like fees will be expensive. Also besides exit-scam, there is also the risk of theft (employees etc.).
I am sure that a new generation of banks which offer guarantees for people's funds will find a lot of customers willing to give away the autonomy of holding their own keys in exchange for those guarantees. As a business model, they will succeed.

Greetings to all those bottom shorters out there. So, now you are sitting on a short position opened at 3.2k? Well that's almost 10% of a loss by now... if you didn't use any leverage! 
OK, now you are locked in at 10% loss, and your liquidation is gonna happen at about 4k - if you don't close your shorts. Is this rally going to make it in the next few weeks?
Just remember Clint Eastwood: 
You've got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk? 
@_date: 2018-12-24 15:09:26
It's a fundamental issue but not specific to crypto, it applies to every currency and value store: if you store your dollars at home in cash and they burn, you lose everything. If you bury your gold in the rocky mountains under a rock and forget where it is, you lose everything. If you keep a map to the location and a thief gets it, you lose everything.
So if crypto succeeds as a currency, many people will want to have the kind of ease they have currently with fiat: they will store their crypto money in banks and those banks will guarantee certain refund options in case of misuse or theft, just like they do today for bank accounts and credit cards. That's why crypto money won't render banks obsolete, it's simply gonna be a new kind of bank. Most people want it, just like they prefer bank accounts over keeping their cash at home.

Hindsight is 20/20
So shorting each bounce for 1 year... that would have been exactly the same profitable as going long for each rally, you see? In hindsight, it looks easy. But in real time, if you don't get the timing right, short squeeze and liquidation hunters will catch you. And yes, most "shorters" don't get it right.
So everybody who comes here talking about how easy it was to short bitcoin all year is just showing that they have no clue whatsoever.

Just to make it explicit: unless funds on a credit card, bank account or whatever, if you mess up your private keys, your funds are lost forever, period. Nobody will be able to help you whatsoever. There is no key recovery, nothing. If you don't have backups for your keys and your disk drive or hardware wallet or whatever goes pop, you lose everything.
On the other hand: if a thief gets your private keys or backups of your private keys, you lose everything either. There is no entity that could reverse a thief's transaction with your funds, like you may be used to with your credit cards. Stolen coins are gone for good, like stolen cash. 
So you have to find a balance between not losing your keys and securing your keys. It's not easy to get this right.
Sorry for this rather long post with lots of obvious information for 99% of people in here. It's for the 1% who never thought about key management and plan to start now.
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:28:19
It kind of makes sense though. If you short sell your not yet mined coins at a price that is profitable for you now, you take the risk of not making even higher profits, but you eliminate the risk of working for a loss. It's a form of risk management.
