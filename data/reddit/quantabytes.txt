That alone may not be sufficient: the exchange may aggregate your outputs showing that the outputs were sent to a single entity, which is often identifiable.

I've no idea. Seeing the binary-tree structure with such a large amount of Bitcoins reminded me of this figure. I'm not sure what the intention is. So far, it is quite easy to track the coins. However, how long will this continue?
EDIT: Wow, there is another thread discussing this:  If these txes are being created by the Mt. Gox code it won't stop splitting until the outputs are 10 BTC.
EDIT: I think this comment explains it:

I think there are many properties of functional programming languages, especially persistent data structures ( that make them really suitable for analyzing the block chain. But that's another discussion ;-)
The Transaction Analyzer is not entirely client-side. I am using Vaadin ( to create the UI -- this helps with prototyping. However, the separation between the UI and the querying of the block-chain is clean and I will be exposing it through an API. In fact, I have partially started this here: 
The Transaction Analyzer is the first of many tools that can be built in this area. I am prototyping them in this way to clarify what actually needs to be exposed through an API. Then anyone will be able to create completely client-side transaction analyzers, block explorers, etc.
Also, Datomic Free can be used and distributed in open-source projects.

You only have to paste the very first transaction. You can then select the transactions in the input and output lists and click the "Add Transaction(s)" button below those lists. But you're right, it would be better if you could manipulate the graph from the graph view only.

I like it. 100 bits for you @_date: 2014-06-30 16:01:44
I would say the goal of a mixer is to make transaction analysis as difficult as possible by combining and splitting bitcoins from different sources. The more sources, the more bitcoins involved, the structure produced by the combining and splitting mechanisms, all contribute to the effectiveness of the mixer. Of course, there are also off-block chain concerns, e.g. logs, etc. The problem is, we will only know the effectiveness of a mixer if it stands the test of future analyses. For example, the Silk Road operated an internal mixer. But now that the FBI are in possession of the former Silk Road servers, and possibly logs, how effective will it prove to be?
If I possessed stolen bitcoins and I wanted to keep them, I would not do anything with them at this point. The state of the art in mixing and anonymization is still a work in progress (e.g. DarkWallet). Also, the area of transaction analysis itself is only developing. I would try to wait until the area is better understood.

Neither did I. I was recently reading the Ethereum whitepaper and it distinctly says that "all "light" implementations of Bitcoin-based meta-protocols rely on a trusted server to provide the data" and I think they were including colored coins in their definition of Bitcoin-based meta-protocols. Has this now changed?

There are two probable reasons for the block reward halving the way it does: (1) it's simpler to implement (2) it favours early adoption -- start mining now before the next drop.
@_date: 2014-04-29 09:55:37
This is a really interesting question. There are very few methods for really understanding the level of activity on the block chain. As pointed out, part of the problem is separating "real" transactions from internal ones.
At the same time, we can use metrics like "Bitcoin days destroyed" (
We can also try to categorize transactions based on structural properties within the block chain. For example, this is a partial visualization of block   The green vertices represent txes within the block, the red vertices represent txes from previous blocks that are redeemed by vertices in this block, and the blue vertices are txes in future blocks that redeem txes in this block. Each directed edge indicates that the target redeems an output of the source. As you can see, and this occurs quite often, the txes are not all isolated transfers of ownership (small connected components) but link together many other txes that occur around the same time (large connected components). It might be possible to categorize and quantify different types of transfer.
It it also possible to track certain types of transactions, e.g. P2SH txes, multisig txes, etc. This is a plot of the number of txes per block that have at least one output that is a P2SH:  This could also be an indicator of sorts.
I am working on some analysis tools in this area at QuantaBytes ( You can message me if you would like to discuss further.

Blockchain.info has been monitoring the number of orphaned blocks for the past ~3 months:  I don't know of any per-depth results though.
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:35:37
(1) The operation is currently a bitwise right shift of a 64-bit integer. Even if the precision is increased, the operation will stay the same and is very easy to extend. (2) There is an incentive to start mining as soon as possible -- especially before the next halving day.
I'll admit, both these arguments are fairly weak.

Maybe this was the exploitation of such a flaw ;-)
@_date: 2014-06-21 11:41:33
This is the real pain point. blocknotify and walletnotify work well for notifying your app when a relevant transaction takes place. However, issues like double-spend attempts, re-orgs, forks, etc. are the real difficulty.

I'll try it out. I wonder how visually distinct they will appear.
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:40:16
Yes, you're right. I think the transactions that derive from the 180K tree completely subsume the 19K tree. So the 4,063 unspent outputs with a value of 202,106 BTC were created by combining these two trees. I need to double-check that I am doing the intersection correctly.

Very nice. If it had an API it would make a great proving ground for trading bots.
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:24:25
I need to implement this feature. I manually extracted the tx hashes that contain the 133 unspent transaction outputs just now and posted them here:  There are 121 responsible txes.
Unless I've made a mistake, you can inspect each of these and verify that all of their unspent tx outs sum to 202,771 BTC. If you do take a look at this, I'd be interested to know how the balances are distributed between addresses.
@_date: 2014-06-30 12:01:34
Ah, yes, that will be very interesting.
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:39:25
They just added another "level" of txes by spending the outputs of the previous level:  Again, each of these txes creates two unspent outputs.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:24:40
Same as last time. The next level of txes spends all the outputs from the previous level and creates a new level with twice as many unspent outputs:  Some of these txes are still unconfirmed as I post this.
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:34:10
Does a red flag show on the button? Are you sure it is a valid tx hash? If so, can you check the console in your browser for any errors and send them to contact I'm adding some client-side error tracking at the moment to record these types of problems.
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:44:47
Thanks. It was really frustrating trying the follow the Mt. Gox story. There were lots of transaction hashes and addresses being thrown about and it was very difficult to work out if there were any possible connections between them. Even now, it's difficult to know what happened to all those coins after the "binary tree" phase.
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:50:15
Not at the moment. There are actually several components to it, some of which I am thinking of open-sourcing. The backend is written entirely in Clojure and uses Datomic ( to store the block-chain. The Transaction Analyzer is a proof-of-concept built on top of this backend. I will be exposing an API between these components but I haven't really thought about supporting alt-coins.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:37:44

@_date: 2014-01-07 15:36:21
In the video, the interviewee says "mining is a hugely wasteful activity". This is a myth. Mining is securing the Bitcoin network. It is no more wasteful than mining gold out of the ground, melting it down, shaping it into bars, and then putting it back underground again. It is also no more wasteful than the infrastructure behind fiat currencies: central banks, clearing houses, the banking sector, etc.
@_date: 2014-06-30 11:19:58
I don't believe so. A number of people pointed out that the original binary tree patterns were consistent with the types of transactions produced by leaked Mt. Gox source code. I haven't studied the "structure" of the more recent transactions, but their net effect is to drastically reduce the number of unspent transaction outputs (4,063 down to 133). That's why I consider them to be "consolidating" transactions. The additional ~600 BTC also appear to be more Mt. Gox bitcoins. They have not been involved in any other transactions since.
@_date: 2014-06-30 12:00:22
I don't know. There are many theories but I've yet to see anything definitive.

I looked closely at this tool at the time. The backend for QuantaBytes is fairly novel. It is written entirely in Clojure and I am using Datomic ( to store the block chain. The Transaction Analyzer is just the first tool I plan to release.

~202k of the alleged Mt. Gox bitcoins are in 133 transaction outputs, mostly in groups of 2,000 BTC each, see  and the comments for more details. They have not moved since that date.

There is certainly some overlap between the two. Blockchain.info has excellent block explorer functionality. However, if you try to follow the flow of Bitcoins across many transactions, and build up a network such as  it can get confusing. This tool should make that process easier.

Up until block  (my node is a few days behind), the Bitcoins from the a4b08370f0 tx have passed through 17,329 txes. They have resulted in 3,356 unspent tx outputs with a total value of 166,756.98227765 BTC. So they have mingled with something much larger. Do you know if this is the 180K tree? I need to compute the intersection of the two outputs ;-)
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:40:51
It's hard to know. One could speculate that the previous transactions (those in the binary tree patterns) were generated using Mt. Gox's existing system and code to "reliably" take the bitcoins out of whatever cold-storage mechanism they were held in. This latest activity could be a withdrawal (and consolidation) of the bitcoins out of Mt. Gox's systems. I'm guessing though.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:21:17
This is a fair point ;-) I also wonder about the type of information that the popular web-based block explorers can gather. How many people occasional check that the Bitcoins they have in cold storage remain unspent by accessing

(1) How does this method handle increasing precision? I know it's possible, I'm just pointing out some edge cases. (2) It still applies but in a weaker sense.
But I agree, it's a little arbitrary and a gradually decreasing reward has its advantages too.

It is possible to perform this type of analysis in reverse. If you start with the seized Silk Road bitcoins you can "trace their ancestry". However, the Silk Road coins are far trickier to analyze. Their internal mixer was very effective. But watch this space ;-)

The last movement involving the ~202k bitcoins was about two months ago. I posted the details here: 
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:57:20
Yes, I explain it in a little more detail here:  The "green" circles are the transactions that actually belong to each block. They also pull in transactions that are "one step out": the red transactions are transactions from previous blocks, the blue from future blocks.
So, yes, chains of green transactions are transactions that all confirmed at once but reference each other.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:52:17
Yes, this is on my list. I added this type of functionality to a block explorer:  and click on  Export. It can produce GEXF (for Gephi) and GraphML (for yEd).
However, it is far more interesting to group together a bunch of related transactions that span several blocks and visualize the relationships between them than visualizing all of the transactions in a single block.

The "triangular" structures are transactions that are merging large numbers of inputs (downward triangles) or creating large numbers of outputs (upward triangles). Many of the large connected components are due to SatoshiDice. I have to do some further analysis to work out what the rest are. To be honest, there is much more connectivity pulled into each individual block than I expected.
@_date: 2014-09-18 10:22:56
Correct. Although the bankruptcy executor has not provided the addresses at which they hold the "found" bitcoins, the fact that the amounts tally so closely suggests they are the same bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:04:22
Sometimes a miner intentionally includes only the coinbase transaction so that the block size is small, propagates through the network quickly, and is less likely to be orphaned. I don't think that's the reason here though.
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:42:26
Absolutely. We need to know and quantify exactly what we are adding to the block chain with each tx.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:39:51
This makes sense. If Mt. Gox has somehow "regained access to their lost keys", then this may be a normal part of moving the coins out of cold storage.
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:53:14
This particular tool takes a transaction hash (or a group of transaction hashes) and enumerates all transactions they are derived from it, until it reaches unspent transaction outputs. If you take an arbitrary transaction, you will often end up with millions of derived transactions as the bitcoins combine other "external" bitcoins. The two transactions that are the roots of the binary tree patterns are unusual in that the bitcoins have not yet mixed in any meaningful way with external sources.
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:58:22

I think this will become a very important issue. The central question is whether or not Bitcoins are fungible. I don't think they are.

On the other end of the spectrum, virgin coins have sold at a premium (
What if regulators maintained the blacklists according to their definition of taint? A regulator could require each merchant operating within its jurisdiction to disclose their receiving addresses. They must only accept untainted coins (which they can verify through an API call to the regulator). Maybe they need to pay a tax to keep the coins untainted. A holder of tainted coins may be able to have their coins untainted by identifying themselves and the source of the coins to the regulator. Different regulators could have different definitions of taint; there could be an exchange rate between them. Even the entire concept of tainted non-fungible Bitcoins could be abstracted at a higher level to produce a fungible coin with respect to a given regulator.
