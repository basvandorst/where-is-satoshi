Great way to lose money!

Sacrifice my profit for a good cause? Keep dreaming, comrade.
@_date: 2014-05-19 10:48:30
Must we always associate bitcoin with fringe political movements?  
The conspiracy nuts are driving away the mainstream investors.

The inverter is wasting energy - the ATM is not using 110V AC internally.  
Drop the inverter and the ATM's internal AC adapter and run it straight off DC. If you're lucky it even uses 12V internally.

Thy neighbors *ass*.  
But if you did covert it, I don't blame you - that ass is highly covetable.

And the surest way to keep our community small is by harping endlessly about crush-the-government ideology.

I don't think debit cards are much use for buying stuff online.

Yes, and ghash have a strong incentive to under-report their hashrate.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:52:03


I stopped reading there.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:56:59
Exchanging bitcoin to/from another currency will also cost you.
@_date: 2014-06-15 04:19:17
Or they would be if they didn't convert to fiat immediately. If they shorted BTC they even made money off the price drop.
@_date: 2014-04-26 08:30:42
Misleading headline: these are not apps made by Google, they are apps available through the Google app store.
@_date: 2014-04-24 05:50:35
"Bit" is a poor choice for these reasons:  
1. Bit is already used for another computing-related concept.  
2. Usually coins are the smaller denominations of a currency (e.g. dollar bills, cent coins), with bits and bitcoins it would be the other way around.
We should try to make bitcoin less confusing, not more.
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:16:58
There is a difference between "belong to" and "be the property of"
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:28:25
This is actually good news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:05:01
Keep that up, and pretty soon nobody will even know what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-06-22 06:11:02
It was just a decoy for the Second Foundation anyway.
@_date: 2014-04-14 08:21:04
Agreed. The "fuck the government" chorus is off-putting to those that don't share that philosophy.
We should promote bitcoin, not a political philosophy.  
Until we do, bitcoin will always be a tiny currency for "weird" outsiders that "want to topple the government".
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:13:27


Yes, posts about how it was really good news for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-19 11:07:08
I'm not holding my breath.

This is cool and all but jeez, hire a competent industrial designer.
That thing looks like it belongs in the USSR.
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:40:13
They could, but they won't.   
They could easily afford a 51% attack (or 75% for that matter) and just mine empty blocks until everyone else gives up.  
But what would they gain by that? Nothing. Taxes existed in the past when all transactions were cash, they will exist even if we all switch to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:54:49
Someone has got a very high opinion of how influential this subreddit is...
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:07:42
Nice. Do some European ones too?
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:51:46


No that's a mebibit. Please learn the difference, one day a job interview may hang in the balance.
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:57:04
Preach, brother!

That just prices that Satoshi reads the Times.

Hey now, not all bitcoiners are randroid lolbertarians.
@_date: 2014-06-16 04:24:30


Exactly. If you mine at an unlucky pool you lose money.
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:08:29
You know what they say...
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:36:04
1. This is incredibly sad.  
2. The house always wins.  
3. Gambling is a tax on people who don't understand statistics.
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:43:04
If you want to promote bitcoin as a tax-dodging scheme, it will forever be a fringe currency and will be outpaced by dogecoin or some other altcoin. 
People don't like being preached to.
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:25:15
This is very clever, too bad you need bitcoin to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-02 06:56:17


Which will only accept a small amount of your pesos or be mysteriously out of dollars, even though you just saw someone deposit a huge stack of dollars there a moment ago.
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:19:44
Wait, bank transfers are reversible? Is this a US- specific thing?
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:52:29
And promoting bitcoin as a tool for circumventing the law will make most people ignore it.
If you try to make bitcoin into a soapbox for your political beliefs you will destroy it.
@_date: 2014-06-09 21:08:58
Bah, the internet is a fad.
@_date: 2014-05-10 14:10:30
True, but that doesn't mean all operating systems are equally secure.
@_date: 2014-06-06 20:28:17


Because altcoins are not being promoted mainly by crush-the-government zealots.

Libertarians asking for donations? Ayn Rand would not be pleased.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:07:07
Well of course they are going up - this subreddit is full of ads for  them. People write "ghash dangerously large", but people read "ghash most popular".
People aren't idiots. They know ghash is popular for a reason. They can do the math, they know low variance equals higher ROI. 
By all means, continue trying to make people act against their own self-interest. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:54:02
If I ever thought I was doing anything even remotely similar to that toupee-wearing buffoon, I would kill myself.

It must be a US thing. I've never seen anyone pay for groceries with a cheque. Come to think of it, I've only seen a cheque used once or twice, and I'm not young.

There's an old creationist in Washington, and everyone in this thread is fellating him.

That's a real sub. Wow.

And a community with fewer self-righteous ideologues.

Nothing has intrinsic value. Name something you believe has intrinsic value, and I'll give a scenario where it is worthless or less than worthless.

Only by wealthy industrialists, though.  
I'm still trying to work out the difference between randroids and lolbertarians. Care to explain?

See? This is what I'm talking about. Most people don't want to hear this. Rattling on about it will make them ignore bitcoin.

I don't think Putin wants a payment system he can't control.
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:03:22
They could, in theory. In practice they'd rather use the money for something else.
And why not? What does government have to gain from destroying bitcoin? Taxes? Please, taxes existed in the days of untraceable gold coins, they'll exist in the days of traceable bitcoins.

Ol' Ron has been predicting the imminent collapse of the US dollar since forever. He's also a creationist.  
Please don't let him be the only bitcoin spokesperson.

I like "mikes".

Why? Serious question.

Glad we found a permanent solution to this the last time it happened, instead of going off on a wild goose chase with the block withholding attack.   
@_date: 2014-06-20 07:56:21
Such a weird concept.  
"Yeah, I don't have any money on me, but let me scribble on this piece of paper, that's as good as cash, right?"

Free money? Sounds socialist.
