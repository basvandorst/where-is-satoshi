I did exactly the same a couple of weeks ago. Sent funds to my Ledger with too low of a fee, and it was stuck for several days before I solved it.
My solution: The so-called "child pays for parent" method. It involves creating a new transaction from the address that received your unconfirmed funds, to a new address (which is also owned by you), with such a high fee that miners will include both the parent and child transaction in a block (from a miner's point of view, the parent transaction has to be included if the rewards from the child are to be reaped). Visualized:
**A** ---&gt; **B** ---&gt; **C**
The transaction from **A** to **B** is stuck, so you make a new transaction from **B** to **C** which a high enough fee to unstuck it. **A** ---&gt; **B** is the parent transaction, **B** ---&gt; **C** is the child.
You have to do the following:
1. Make a new receiver address on the Ledger, which will serve as the final destination of your coins (just click Receive). This is address **C** above.
2. Find your stuck transaction from **A** to **B** on blockchain.info, record its size in bytes (lets call this **s^p**) and fee (**f^p**).
3. Create a transaction (but do not send yet!) from the address with the unconfirmed funds, to the newly created address, i.e. the transaction **B** ---&gt; **C**. This is simple if the only funds on your Ledger are the unconfirmed ones on the **B** address. You do not have to send the full (unconfirmed) amount of funds on **B** to **C**, you only have to make a transaction, so the amount can be minimal. However, if you have funds on several addresses on the Ledger, it's more difficult, because as far as I can see, it's not possible to specify the sending address via Ledger. This means that the Ledger can choose to use an address other than **B** for sending the funds, which would not help us at all. My solution here was to send a high enough amount so that the funds had to be taken from the right address, but depending on how many addresses you have and the amount of funds on them, this can probably be quite complex.
4. Specify transaction fees, let's call this **f^c**. Click "custom fees" to specify an amount yourself. Check  to decide on a fee. I would recommend going a bit high here to make sure that the transaction goes through this time (if you manage to create a second, stuck transaction, it will cost you more to unstuck both of these..). You'll have to do some maths here, but the key is this: The sum of the fees of the parent transaction and the child transaction has to pay for the sum of the size (in bytes) of the parent transaction and the child transaction. So (**f^p** +  **f^c**)/(**s^p** + **s^c**) &gt; **x** sat/byte, where **s^c** is the byte size of the child transaction (**B** --&gt; **C**) and **x** is the fee needed according to  You can find the size of the child transaction, **s^c**, by inputting "*1 satoshis per byte*" in the custom fees field, and then look at the total transaction fees under "Total spent": Convert it from BTC to satoshi (10^8 satoshi in a BTC), divide by 1 sat/byte, and you should get a number of bytes. However, I myself though this size looked a bit low, so I increased it a bit to match with the estimates of  where you can enter a number of inputs (possibly more than one in this case) and outputs (one) to estimate the byte size of the transaction.
5. Double-check your math.
6. Send.
6. (Optional for sanity) Check the blockchain.info record of your newly created transaction to confirm that (**f^p** +  **f^c**)/(**s^p** + **s^c**) &gt; **x** sat/byte.
7. (Hopefully) Have both of your transactions confirmed in the next block.
There are other methods such as waiting for the transaction to slip out of the mempool and sending it again (with the correct fee), or sending the same transaction again with a higher fee as a double spend, but I haven't tried them. This worked for me. Good luck!

It's the publication date of the whitepaper's reference nr. 6, i.e. [this paper](

I haven't come over any Norwegian businesses that accept Bitcoin as payment, but something I've noticed is that most of the people at my university that I mention Bitcoin to, have already heard of it. That's a big change from a year ago. So it's coming.

I didn't know they did this. Have they given a reason for banning Bitcoin-related apps (or maybe only apps capable of transfering BTC?)?

mBTC, µBTC, nBTC.

I'm from Norway, which made it somewhat difficult to acquire BTC. I bade an international bank transfer to Bitstamp via transferwise.com, that whole thing took 5-ish days (which I'm happy for in hindsight, as the price fell from $250 to $50 in the meantime).
