Perhaps, but the answer still applies I think. And I found it very helpful. 
I think it's less about need, and more about want. If there is enough demand to drive wanting to pay in batching, then the upward pressure could outweigh the downward.

I'm downvoting because if I understand correctly, P2Pool.org is a misleading name meant to confuse people into joining their private pool. They're NOT part of the peer-to-peer pool mining described here:

Great analysis. Diagram?

I use Coinbase and have no complaints, and I immediately transfer purchased BTC from coinbase's web wallet to my personal wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:09:16
- Source: converts $1,000 to BTC @ Coinbase for 1% exchange fee + $0.15 flat bank fee
- Source sends bitcoins instantly to destination
- Destination: converts BTC into local currency at local exchange for x% fee + bank fee (specifics unknown)
Time expended: ~10 minutes
Value of x unknown and dependent on presence of local BTC exchange

Time is important. When is the last time you tried to transfer money to an international party? Or cash a check made out to you FROM you (retirement fund loan) which took 8 days to clear?

Biggest mistakes: 
- not respecting the fact that he who holds the private key holds the power. I housed 1.7 BTC on Mt. Gox...I didn't even day trade, it was just out of "neatness" factor that I had my assets "secure" in two places. I lost my Mt. Gox coins, and I consider myself lucky that I only lost 1.7.
- I didn't backup my private keys from my android wallet and lost 0.3 BTC after my phone bricked
- GAMBLING

I'm glad there are services like this out there.

This looks like a good start, thanks for telling me about it.
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:23:15
Agreed. I've lost roughly 4 BTC through gambling and it happens one hand at a time...
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:34:04
You miss the point of my post; time is important. I wasn't making a statement about banks (US or otherwise).
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:43:15
But I think this misses the point. If I'm an investor and I assume constant downward pressure, why would I buy?  I suppose only if I have faith that the demand to pay in bitcoins (and the resulting buy activity on exchanges) will outweigh the average retailer activities of selling BTC for USD.

Surely so does the individual who took the time to create this care package and hand write the apology letter. I think that's what makes the gesture worth it.

I think honesty is a tall order. This is a speculative, innovative technological space. You're likely getting honesty all over the place, they're just honest opinions. No one can tell the future.
Also keep in mind that as people spend the coins they've possessed for a long period of time and the sources who receive those coins liquidate them, that will put downward pressure on the price.

OP, my adapter/cord was also faulty and it blows my circuit breaker. I used a spare with roughly the same output. Hope this helps you use both units.

Honestly, time for you to do some math and determine your personal risk aversion. There are no guarantees. Today I mine 0.000827 BTC/GH/s/Day. I'm in BTCGuild. Your projections need to take into account the potential future growth of the network's hashing power, and the difficulty increases. 
The 50 gh/s unit would yield 0.041379 btc/day, or about $48/day if (a) you had it today, and (b) the price stays around $1,150

I compliment your desire to learn more about this topic, way to go. 
All crypto-currencies are speculative commodities/currencies at this point, so advice as blunt as "one is better than the other" must always be opinion because no one can tell the future...only retrospective analysis can be factual. 
I'm personally keeping my efforts in bitcoin. I guess you could say I'm "long in bitcoins" and don't put much faith in the others due to the amount of inertia behind bitcoin. You're right that LTC might have more rapid growth at this point in the game, but it also might flop. So Bitcoin seems the lower risk.
At the end of the day you'll have to make the decision for yoruself.

If you sell you're down. You have unrealized losses until you realize them. I don't think you can escape them without the price recovering...but someone might know more than me.

NP, the Jalapenos come with 13V but I couldn't find a spare. I did find a 20V with the same plugin and that Jalapeno runs a little hot, but it has been running for 6 weeks like this.
I emailed their support near the time that it happened and only heard back from them about 4 days ago...in that email they asked me to open an RMA request. :)

I can relate. I lost 3 to blackjack back in June. I can advise the urges may return. Stay strong.

LTC is currently worth it according to the BTC-E exchange, and it's easy to trade there. Also LTC has had a recent rally. But I personally think of LTC as a "speculation on a speculation". I think BTC has all the backing of entrepreneurs and the big-brand appeal. I mine LTC and exchange them for BTC. 
Mining BTC directly will take special mining gear which you can purchase outright or pre-order from some sites. They're USB and you don't need a strong machine to run them.
BFL has a black-friday deal tomorrow on their 50 GH/s machine. But this company has very bad rep due to over-promising and under-delivering. According to them, however, their 5 adn 50 GH/s machines are both shipping in bulk...the pre-orders took FOREVER before they shipped (I ordered 2 on April 1 and received them Oct 20).
