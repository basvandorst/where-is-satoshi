That was the best backhanded compliment I've ever received. Purely for that reason, here's an upvote!

Thank you!

It wasn't meant to address anything, rather to help clarify the seemingly misunderstood metaphor made. That's not saying I disagree with you about Tron though, when I first heard about it, all in thought was "That sounds like garbage" and I have never seen a reason to think otherwise.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:25:21
I'm glad it helped you! I kinda needed it too honestly! Happy cake day by the way!

It's just a play on words. Superman dies if he's around Kryptonite, and Bitcoin is a crypto-currency. Crypto-night sounds the same as Kryptonite.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:43:24
Either way, I came up with the joke out if thin air and it seems to have accomplished its purpose... making people laugh :)
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:16:09
I think I'm gonna get that tattooed on my butt cheek.  Probably not, but maybe.

If you can't handle someone making a lighthearted joke to try to ease the tensions when a lot of people are frustrated with the correction... then it's more than likely the case that you're the problem, not everyone else.

He said it would be better to have said sundown instead of 7pm, and he was right, it would've had a smoother flow to the wording.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:14:42
Aww man. You're absolutely right. I was wondering how I should've worded that, and 7pm was the best I could come up with. I will tell it with your change if I ever tell it in the future! Thanks!!
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:13:44
That joke is a good one!
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:15:26
Well I gave you an upvote for the attempt! I'm glad you enjoyed it!

Took me a solid minute to look at your username haha! Have you met u/Clark-Kent ?
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:13:33
Ahhh... That's a better way to word it for sure. A guy said "sundown" instead of 7pm earlier in the post, but deleted his comment I think. So the best wording for this joke is probably "Why can't Superman trade bitcoin after sundown?"
Thanks for contributing!
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:32:45
Definitely! ...maybe
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:26:40
It's seriously the best! The scene doesn't even live up to it because of how well he told the story! (the scene is still hilarious, but Bryan Cranston is just an amazing story teller)

Well the name cryptonight, maybe. But I didn't see the joke anywhere in the page you linked. Maybe I just missed it?
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:16:10
Solid freaking joke right there!
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:14:59
He's meaning "why fight to compete in a market that has a lot of competitors when you could instead go into a market with little to no competitors?"
It's like if there's an unbeatable boxer at one weight, other boxers might wanna go to different weights so they don't have to go against the unbeatable boxer for the championship.
Why try to compete with bitcoin when you can try to market yourself to a different market?
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:57:36
You disliked the joke that much? Ahh...I'm honestly sorry. I was just trying to help spread some laughs

Have you heard the story of when Bryan Cranston made Jerry Seinfeld laugh? It's pure gold!
Edit: here's a link to him telling the story 
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:08:05
I don't see the comment anywhere, but the guy posted somewhere that he beat me to it and I agreed. I don't remember exactly how I worded it, but I pretty much said "great minds think alike, but average minds think of what great minds thought of 5 weeks ago" or something like that. Pretty much saying I'm average and he's a genius. So yeah, I never saw that post, but it's awesome that there's someone in the world who had a similar enough thought process to me that we came up with the same joke. In my head it was like cryto's (less funny) version of South Park's fish stick joke. Something so obvious, but somehow still not obvious, that you chuckle a little when you think about it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:40:21

Nah. I don't. Pretty happy with the post actually and I still chuckle a little when I read the joke.
Plus the post let a ton of people that are funnier than me write witty comments back (some even at my expense). So in that sense, this is a very successful post, in that it enabled discussion, spread happiness, and brought a sense of levity to this sub, even if only for a day.

In the link he posted there's a comic where a guy bought a physical bitcoin off of eBay. He bragged that it was worth $16,000, but he got it for only $14.99. And another guy says "Because that's chocolate covered with gold foil" 
I was calling the comic "gold", as in I thought it was hilarious. But in reference to the comic, what I was calling gold was actually just chocolate covered in gold foil. Kinda a meta joke that was DEFINITELY a dad joke.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:24:22
Maybe, just maybe, they're saying bitcoin is better than traditional banks because this happens to banks often? 
But probably not.

I just trolled them. Acted like I was interested in joining and asked for info to help me join. After they responded, I wrote “I googled it and someone said you can buy part of a bitcoin. They said it’s as easy as downloading an app, signing up, and buying the $12 worth of coin. Is this true or were they lying to me? I don’t get how it’s possible to only purchase part of a coin?”
They deleted my comment. So I doubled down. "Why did you delete my comment? I was just trying to make sure it was a good idea to join your team. I don't know if I want to anymore."
Edit: Just wanted to add this ending... F**king scam artists

Honestly, the thought of losing money I've invested doesn't make me wanna sell my bitcoin and leave the game. Dealing with unreliable exchange platforms... I'm pretty freaking sick of that. So far having to deal with Coinbase is the ONLY reason why I've considered waiting for a decent peak and selling out to call it quits.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:42:29
I talked to my younger brother (who is near broke) talked about bitcoin a few days ago when the price dipped. I helped get him a temporary job to help him get out of debt, and we were talking while we were working.
The price was already passed its low point and back up to around $9500 when we talked about it. At the end of the day, the price was around $10500 I think.
At the end of the day, he got mad at me because "It's your fault I didn't invest in it during the dip. You told me it wasn't a good idea. I could've invested $500 into it earlier today and that $500 could be $1000 right now!"
I replied, "I told you not to invest any money you can't afford to lose. Right now, you can't afford to lose any money. I said it was possible that bitcoin could keep dropping, or it could be back up to $11k by the end of the day. But for someone who owes more money than they have in their bank account, investing wouldn't be a smart choice. And also, if you invested $500 and sold right now, you'd have around $550."
Moral of the story: When it comes to money, stupid and ignorant people will blame anyone for their problems except for themselves. Your friend isn't unfortunately stupid, and your friend isn't willfully ignorant. Your friend is forcefully ignorant. They are making it a point to not have to learn anything about bitcoin, but willing to invest $50k into it. These are the types of people you want to avoid.
Imagine they do something wrong and lose access to their coins, who will your friend blame? You. Imagine you go through the whole process, get the bitcoin, and everything goes smoothly... Then in 6 months Trump bans bitcoin or something and the price drops to $1k, who will your friend blame for his losses? You. Your friend won't know any better (by their choice) than to blame you for any problems that come up from their investment. To me, it almost seems like they refuse to learn about it so they can blame you instead of themselves if bitcoin turns out to be a bad investment for them.
If you have the bitcoin to insure his $50k, you don't need .4BTC. Sure, it would be cool to have it, but you don't need it. The risk of something going wrong seems to outweigh the reward of .4BTC to you. That's just assuming everything goes right with buying the bitcoin and setting up the wallet.
This is all avoiding the fact that they don't want to have it be traceable until later. They won't put their hands on it and they won't go through an exchange so it's not on the record... In my opinion, this looks like the best case scenario is your friend is overly cautious and an idiot. Worst case scenario, your friend is trying to do some shady stuff and is setting you up to be the fall guy in case they get caught.
I don't know your best course of action, but if I were you, I'd get far far away from not only that situation, but from that friend too. They seem rude, disrespectful to you, stupid, and will probably lead to trouble if you're around them for too long.
Just my 2 satoshis. (get it? Like two cents, but the bitcoin version)
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:23:43
Listen to u/bobstay. I'm all for investing in bitcoin, but I also have a savings account large though that I could make $0 over the next year and still be fine. Rent, car payment, insurances, etc are all covered for a year with my emergency fund. Mine is a bit excessive, yes, but that is because my job is freelance, so while I can make a lot of money in a day, I could realistically go 2-3 months without working.
Plan for the worst, hope for the best.
For a typical person with a normal 9-5 job, I'd say to have 3-4 months of savings before you start investing. Since you've already invested, and done pretty well with it, I'd get that safety net built for yourself now. My advice would be to figure out your monthly expenses and multiply it by 4, and sell that much of your BTC to put into a savings account and not touch unless you have a financial emergency.
For the sake of easy math, let's say your total monthly cost of living is $1000.
That's the amount of savings you'd want to have earmarked as an emergency fund. You could sell it off at once, or take a staggered approach and sell 25% at a time once every two weeks (to help average cost so you don't waste a lot selling during a dip on accident)
If you're paycheck to paycheck, you want to have the security to know you won't be homeless next month if something bad happens. Say you break your leg in a bad car accident tonight, on top of all of the hospital bills, you won't be able to go to work for a few days/weeks while you recover. That by itself will hurt your financial situation a lot.
If you woke up in the hospital and checked the price of BTC to see it was at $1, would you be completely screwed?
I'm saying this because I really want the best for you... take what you can and get yourself as much of a cushion as possible, just in case the unthinkable happens. Of course I don't know your situation, so a lot of this is just general advice I'd give to anyone. I guess seeing the phrase "paycheck to paycheck" worries me, because I've been there before. It took a lot of really smart financial planning and a ton of effort, but I was able to improve my financial situation to the point where I have a really good savings account. I hope you're able to get here some day soon too, because while I still have to watch my money, I haven't had to stress over it in a long time. And it's the best feeling in the world.
Take my thoughts and advice for what they are: thoughts and advice from a stranger on the internet. Do what you will with it. I hope for the best for you!

Honestly, I liked reading your perspective. I fundamentally disagree with a few of your points, but I don't think I'd say you're "wrong." Just like you, I'm very skeptical of bitcoin. Though at the same time, I've also invested a pretty substantial amount of money into it as well. So while I'm skeptical of it, I also believe in it. However, I only invested around 10% of my savings in bitcoin, an amount that I am comfortable losing. That should illustrate my level of trust in bitcoin.
I hope you understand that I appreciate the fact that you came to a sub that you didn't agree with and posted your differing opinion, and your reasoning behind your opinions. It's never wrong to have intellectual discussions about things that affect our lives. You said in an earlier comment that some people gave you insight that you hadn't seen before. I'm glad some people were able to help you see bitcoin a little differently.  And after reading your comments I can see your reasoning a bit better too. Because of your post, anyone who wanted to learn was able to.
The spread of knowledge and ideas, especially those you don't agree with, are what make humans so special. It's how we grow and learn. So thank you for starting this thread.

You're a good person for being willing to put your family over potentially higher profits from HODLing. I think karma will find a way to pay you back in a very good way for being willing to do that.
And yes, it is awesome that because of a crypto currency you're able to help your family in this sad time. I hope everything works out for you!

It let's me enter in my username and password, but once I start the two step verification, it gives me this error. "Response status code unacceptable: 403"
Naturally there's no response from Coinbase...
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:49:32
Oh okay, I see your point a little bit better now. Thank you for explaining it further. I can agree with that, however I do think the amount of people hearing about it now is higher than ever before, and the people hearing about it care about it more.
I guess one way to imagine what I'm saying is this: on a scale from 0-100 (0 being extremely unknown, 100 being completely mainstream), bitcoin goes up and down as people find out about it and others stop caring about it. But in 2013 it probably maxed at around a 30ish, while now I'd say it's closer to 45-50. In 2015 and 2016, I'd say it was probably close to a 10. So the interest in bitcoin fluctuates, but it feels higher now than ever.
That may be because of what you said, I'm paying more attention to it. You do have a really good point with that. I do think that bitcoin is getting more attention right now than ever before, and I think people will lose interest in it over the next few months. I could totally be wrong though
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:36:31
It just sucks cause I'd love to buy a few hundred dollars worth while it's in the dip. But just like yesterday... my account didn't work the entire time it was dipped. Could only log in after the craziness ended.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:49:08
Thank you! I started this thread essentially to gain perspective from people with more experience in actual bitcoin investing (as mine was all theoretical until a few hours ago). I wanted to explain my experience and my thoughts on it, then see what others with more experience thought. So your insight was not only very helpful to me, it was also extremely appreciated!
Most everyone seems to agree that even buying at the current ATH will pay off in the long run. That's not a sustainable formula to follow for any investment, as everything will eventually reach its ultimate ATH and only go downhill from there. But I'm confident that this will not be the ultimate ATH and in a few weeks that ~0.11 bitcoin I bought tonight will be worth more than what I bought it for.
So again, thank you for your comments and great insight!
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:26:37
I don't know if it's a "big news" or anything. Just rapidly increasing awareness of bitcoin in the mainstream. I could be wrong, but that's just my theory. I heard about bitcoin in like 2012-2013, but only now do I hear about it often and from many different sources.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:01:17
No, this is Patrick
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:33:08
Right before pressing confirm, I tell myself "You're never getting this money back." If that thought stops me, I won't invest. That's the only way to safely invest, by only investing what you can survive without.
It's like you're reading my mind or something! Nighty night!
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:42:41
That's what I'm hoping happens. But I don't see myself selling for far longer than 2 weeks. 5-6 months from now, if the price is super high and I need the money, I might sell. But I have savings that I could survive for around 18 months with no income, so I don't anticipate NEEDING to sell for any reason.
Barring a massive crash or catastrophic thing happening, what I purchased tonight will likely be in my wallet for 2-4 years. Only because while bitcoin seems to be volatile on a daily basis, it's growth over the last few years has been consistent and astounding. I don't think it will maintain the rate it had in the last 12 months, but I still think it will show consistent growth over the next 2-4 years.
So I'm planning on holding onto this initial investment of ~0.11 bitcoin for the next 2-4 years at least. Unless there's a smarter way to handle my investment, in which case please tell me. I have a good understanding of the basics, but if there are more strategic ways to handle this type of stuff, I'd love to learn.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:25:45
No dude, at this point it's worth it. Maybe not 40,000. But if bitcoin is over $100,000 anytime in 2018, I'll eat my own... 
If bitcoin reaches $1M in 2018, I'll eat my left nut.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:18:33
It's all good! Thanks for letting me know! Now that I think about it, I haven't been on desktop since I signed up. I'll check out desktop later and see what else I'm missing out on! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:09:06
I agree. I'm planning on forgetting about the ones I purchased until March/April, then seeing how it looks.
Of course I'll keep an eye on the price for large drops in case I'm looking to invest more while the price is low.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:29:05
I know. I've always been decent at seeing the big picture of things, without losing sight of the details.
I figure that even if it tanks overnight and it's back to $5000 or something, I'll take the loss and limit my spending for a bit to make up for it.
But if the price jumps up tomorrow and doesn't come back down, then the $11 I "lost" just now will be nothing!
Thank you for the insight and advice!
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:31:52
Yeah it's going down low. Kinda exciting, just in a bad way. Sure I'm "losing money" when the value goes down, but it's almost as fun as watching it go up. The volatility is just fun to watch I guess. Plus I'm still confident it will raise up later on.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:57:08
I was just meaning in an hour by hour. I bought in at around $9100. So while it's a growth in the big picture, it's a small dip relative to when I bought it. But yeah, looking at the last 24 hours (or even the last week), this is insane growth.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:19:25
Dude, that second option is me from 2013-earlier tonight.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:26:01
I'm getting reckless now and should probably go to bed. I'm confident in bitcoin, I've seen it have such success. I decided that since I "took a loss" on the drop (wasn't a bad loss anyway), I'd double down and increase my investment to $1000 total.
It's not a bad idea if I view it as "buying more at a discounted rate".
Joking, I know that's how people lose their money.  But hey, like I said, I'm in it for the long run. I might be mad at myself in 6 months for losing part of my money, or I might be super grateful for what I did. The reward outweighs the risk for me right now, so I went for it!
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:10:47
I agree. I saw it was in the middle of a dip when I made the purchase, but I guess I should've waited it out a little more. I won't worry too much. It's dropped a matter of dollars, it should rise back up soon.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:14:17
The most mainstream place I heard about it back then was Jake and Amir. Now it's in the news constantly with big Wall Street investors talking about it, Mark Cuban chiming in, and Elon Musk having to deny being the creator.
Is the price jump/fall because of the increased publicity? Or is the publicity because of the price jump/fall? Neither is 100% right, because it's a give and take. The price jump/fall makes people talk about it, and when more people talk about it, the price changes.
So I'm not sure what you're getting at. To think the world of bitcoin isn't changing and also becoming more mainstream is a bit short-sighted.

Frankly, I don't know how to give gold, and I'm pretty sure I'm not able to...  But if it could, I'd give you gold for that comment.

I mean during the drop. I haven't had access to my Coinbase for over 2 hours now

Didn't you just say "never", which implies certainty?
Haha no I'm totally joking. You're right. My comment was a little bit sensational and a bit irresponsible. What I should've said, that would've more accurately described my thought, is, "Right now seems to be a good time to buy. It's better to buy during the dips as long as you're confident there will be growth."
Now it's a decent sized dip, so it could bounce back up, or it could keep dropping. I can't log into Coinbase, but if I could, I'd put my money on it bouncing back up.
Thank you for pointing out that I shouldn't be using such strong language in this scenario. It's irresponsible and I'm usually better than that.

Nuts. I hope it's not an issue with my account itself and is just part of the "minor outages" Coinbase is experiencing.

Your comment is 100% right. This is the PERFECT time to buy, but I can't access my account. Fml

I'm on mobile, is it possible on here?

I personally think we will dip for another few weeks before starting a slow and steady climb back to 10k. I don't think it will get much higher than 11-12k throughout the rest of 2018. I'd expect the price to range between 5k and 12k throughout the year. I could be very wrong though.

Here's the thing, you only lose your money once you sell. If you need that 30% of your money that you lost to survive, you should stop buying bitcoin. You're not in a place where it makes financial sense to buy it.
Like you said, there was a dip a while ago and you got scared and sold. And you lost money from it. If there's a dip right now and you sell again, you're not learning from your mistake before.
So basically, if you need that money to pay rent or buy food for this month, take the loss and sell, then stop buying bitcoin until you're in a more stable place financially. If you don't need the money to buy food or pay rent, then stop worrying because selling now will only cause you to lose money again.
