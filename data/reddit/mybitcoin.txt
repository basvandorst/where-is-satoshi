you could have literally been a millionaire reading that issue. you can do that math and extrapolate each word of that article would be worth $10000, or many many times its weight in gold. better than every glossy self-help 'how to make money' guru book combined. Just buying $1000 worth of bitcoins after reading that article would have made you more $ than anyone reading rich dad poor dad books. makes me morose just thinking about the missed opportunity ...can't live in the past

got to keep your eyes peeled for the next big boom. maybe wired/techcruch will cover another new cool technology that anyone can invest in.
Wired did a writeup about snapchat in 2012..now the company is worth $4 billion with 99% of those gains made since the article...so maybe you could have emailed snapchat to invest and with enough dogged determination acquire a tiny ownership without being a VC that would now be worth $10 million or more.
The opportunities are out there. It's up to you to find them, and most importantly, act on them.

strong passwords wont save you. Hackers compromise systems and use social engineering to get what they want so you could have a 1000 character password and it won't do a shred of good. Maybe your system has spyware that you don;t now about and they were able to update t to perform key-logs..your mistake was not keeping the coins offline and relying on 3rd parities for protection.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:23:32
just saw 300 print on gox 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:03:54
yes it trades continuously and selling bitcoin short is very hard
bitcoin will likely keep falling 
@_date: 2013-07-04 02:26:30
for the opposite reason it went to 100?
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:12:46
maybe it should go down a little bit tomorrow..dont want things too overheated

what video was it? louis sells his videos for $5 online but for $10000 it had damn well better be a good one
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:23:38
Just the calm b4 America wakes up and another 30k coins sold and another mtgox crash. 20 soon
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:08:31
WTF..china is recovering much faster than US exchanges
the opposite should be happening 
major buying opportunity 
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:07:24
Not buying bitcoin in 2010/2011 will go down as one of my biggest regrets in life
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:43:27
it's different this time 
congress seal of approval, mass adoption in Europe &amp; China, media attention, etc 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:36:23
This is china's problem..look at the sales volume from bitpay
Chinese prices were bid up excessily mostly due to speculation
@_date: 2013-07-03 21:43:52
does spending tens of thousands of dollars on a bitcoin miner in a saturated environment seem wise? i dont think so
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:09:22
thanks, oh smart one

so close !
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:36:38
 there are many ppl with 500k or more of coins that aren't selling
bitcoin is changing the world why sell now?
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:18:18
don;t use an exchange. exchanges were never part of the original bitcoin protocol
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:01:18
you're speaking too soon again.
 let's not fan the flames of panic.
 right now gox is showing 300

in 2009 maybe it would have been possible to do it by hand  in a reasonable timeframe

that would be a major step forward

there is a 50.00001% chance it will crash

2011 and 2012 coins still to be liquidated

well i was able to convince my mom to buy some
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:23:21
not sure why you would need multiple monitors to track bitcoin unless you are trading across multiple exchanges or you have a bitcoin related business where you need as much data as possible
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:48:19
the good news is bitcoin will soon be at $5 and not worht stealing anymore
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:17:30
buy the dip
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:36:50
Shiff is trying to infer a causal relationship between a rapid appreciation in price and subsequent collapse. He's overlooking the fundamental differences between tulip bulbs and bitcoin. A rare tulip bulb is like a collector's item. It has no utility compared to bitcoin. Tupimania wasn't just over any tulip bulb, but ones that produced multicolored patterns as the result of a genetic mutation. Even presently, tulip and lilly bulbs  with certain mutations can sell for considerable amounts of money. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:10:02
these perts keep criticizing bitcoin and it keeps going up
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:33:17
dont invest more than you're willing to lose
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:36:54
Bitcoin has surged a lot over the past 2 days..that could explain why
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:50:58
he wants bitcoin to be pegged to a certain price which would help him because he has lots of coins but hurt people with few by limiting potential upside
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:13:56
not going to entertain such a possibility
bitcoin like paypal is here to stay
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:50:58
hence 5 vs 2
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:30:19
how many?
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:40:05
no it will increase the value because bitcoin is seeing more widespread use
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:24:22
Flat lines charts in a crash always precede another dump
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:49:01
have money parked in mtgox. i'll pull the tirgger if it goes to $5 again
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:55:31
that is what i proposed

max kaiser was twitching after april crash..more than usual
but he'll have the last laugh
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:53:09
i want more down votes because my belief if that negativity inflicted on me benefits others. That's why  bitcoin is surging today and so is my PCLN stock. Made 1000's so far today on both.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:12:30
yea mining is out of the question. just gonna have to buy &amp; hold like 99% of ppl 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:10:55
i love bitcoin, too
just at a much much lower price
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:48:52
hardly...gonna drop another 10 bucks soon
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:09:20
it takes coins out of circulation like the fbi silk road seizure .so that helps
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:32:17
probably loaded to the teeth in google stock. a few bitcoins don't mean squat to him but a hobby
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:08:57
wish there were a way to down-vote this more
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:22:40
bitcoin has such a huge head start 
dont confuse rising stock prices of obscure coins with popularity
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:50:40
at that rate it may take you a month to buy a  coin

I'm sorry if the courage and sacrifice of our veterans inconvenienced your business 
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:56:21
i guess that makes me feel better about buying in relativity late
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:52:24
given his track record if he says bitcoin is a bubble then you should be buying with both hands. he's worse than a broken clock
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:15:24
still giving myself mental asskickings for not buying/mining coins in 09-2010
but back then bitcoin was truly underground so unless you were part of the community you woudnt know I suppose
@_date: 2013-07-05 15:50:39
i'll buy a little at $5
i wish bitcoin would go higher but the momentum is lower 
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:25:03
still 50% less than what the pizza guy could have had
just to put things in perspctive
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:04:45
the money sits idle on the exhange
@_date: 2013-06-28 07:06:52
I imagine bitpay has to sell the coin to redeem cash. bitcoins have to be sold, if cash is to be rendered, am i wrong?
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:49:19
the big risk is the exchange gets 'hacked' and then closes shop. like a staged burglary 
but a lot of exchanges keep 90% or more of the coins offline mitigating some of the threat
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:13:28
BTCE and Stamp not budging beyond 650
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:33:15
not many coins need to be sold relative to the total volume for the price to fall or rise
this makes coins vulnerable to sudden swoons but if there are buyer,s the price can recover just as quickly as it fell, as we have seen in the past.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:08:00
lost track of how much $ i lost..somewhere in the high 1000's even after selling 1/2 of my stake on the way up before the crash
pretty much being liquidated in blocks of 100-200 every 5 minutes
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:23:42

@_date: 2013-10-19 08:56:50
going to $300 soon
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:35:01
in contrast to the fed, the reserve wouldn't 'print' , just stabilize prices by interceding in crashes and offloading excess
for small transactions this isn;t so important but for merchants dealing in higher volume, stability is an issue
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:27:01
i think he meant it grows doubly exponential . this double exponentiation makes the singularity closer than would be predicted with only singular exponential models
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:19:00
if no one sells there is no market

they will not ship the goods and refund you 
@_date: 2013-06-28 07:12:37

i dunno. doesnt matter since it's regained it back and then some 
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:14:28
im sure you could buy that much in person pretty easily considering how much the price has risen 
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:00:04
technically by his definition , a Google stock certificate (valued at $1011) has $0 intrinsic value. 
bitcoin has value because there is a market for it
what a fucking  doofus

cold storage, buddy
use it 
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:18:11

not going down like the last time. this rally is more controlled without the parabolic intensity &amp; hype of the last rally. 400 soon
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:07:47
anyone see the irony china;s markets are recovering better than US ones
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:02:30
A quick analysis of the crash report shows that roughly 30k coins were sold in the 60% plunge 
If there were a 'reserve' on the other side to buy those coins at say, $200, a lot of this panic could have been avoided and merchants wouldn't have gotten burned. Bitcoin would probably resume its rally and all would be well. But those 30k coins out of 10 million ruined it for everyone, destroying over a billion in wealth despite being worth only 6 million.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:11:42
up up and away
not selling any bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:03:55
the problem is there are too many dormant coins and the market is extremly susceptible to crashes if any of these early folks wants to get out

@_date: 2013-11-09 13:31:03
ppl used this argument in 2011 and bitcoin keeps making new highs. Even if the USA is dragging its feet, we're seeing mass adoption in Europe and China and the rest of the world. Owning a whole bitcoin will be like a luxury so the majority of folks will be transacting in bitcoin fractions.
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:06:53
bitcoin sold out 
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:23:22
that is how an exchange works
a small number of traded shares dictates the market value of all of them
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:21:58
better liquidity? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:57:05
many of the major coin holders from 2010-2012 are liquidating, for one
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:15:20
I bought more at 650
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:31:39
with regard to  the good news is that China controls the price instead of mtgox, so someone would have to dump on the chinese exchange to flush the market. I believe mtgox has enough liquidity to absorb the instantaneous sale of ~30,000-50,000 coins before the price falls to $100 or so.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:16:49
sold 2/3 of my coins very early this morning at 296
we'll see what happens
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:17:26
10 bitcoins = decent automobile 
100 bitcoins = small home in crappy neighborhood
1000 = join the .05%
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:12:44
that's what ppl said about bitcoin too
and then BOOM 
litecoin has applications such as moving money across borders and further unrealized potential
@_date: 2013-10-25 20:58:28
that was when they were worth about 1/2  cent each or about the same time as the pizza guy
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:23:01
either do it all at once and forget about it (make sure you only use money you can afford to lose.)
buy 1/3 now, wait, buy another chunk later etc.  
TBH, just do what causes the least stress
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:27:56
yea but so few coins were sold relative to the total volume. only 30k. now it's a mess and that will take more than 30k coins to solve
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:19:00
how did they guess your username and password?

This thread has become an IAMA
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:25:45
I beg to differ about bitcoin being impervious to forming bubbles, but agree the long term price is much higher
@_date: 2013-07-01 18:44:22
litecoin? dont count those chickens before they hatch
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:11:05
not gonna crash this time around. the accent is much slower than last time. I surmise the most we could fall is around $20-40 if some big holders want to cash out and then new highs
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:59:40
bitcoin rallies in 3-4 day increments followed by 3-4 day pauses. the second pause will occur there
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:59:39
over the long term it's going up because there are no alternatives to bitcoins/ it's not like real estate, stocks, or collectibles where there exist multiple alternatives. If you want to invest in alternative currency, you have to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:21:15
no one wants to make the mistake of selling too soon, including hackers.  (like I did last week when i sold 2/3 of my coins. I bought some more back in the low 330's tho)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:57:46
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:46:59
ur gonna lose everything
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:16:17
that is the scam. have ppl pre-order really expensive miners, in the meantime use them, and fill the order after they are nearly useless
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:38:22
imho, I would rather buy a house with my bitcoins but this is great PR and I hope more companies follow 
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:53:51
 ..go read about it on wikipedia and reddit
if you're smart enough to unlock the mysteries of the fed, ur smart enough to learn about bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:45:38
30k shares or $6m caused the crash. that is a rounding error for the likes of wall st.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:57:43

@_date: 2013-04-22 20:46:49
there is always a finite area of computing power but not a finite prime number
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:38:38
Diversification is a good way to play this.Even after the crash bitcoin is 1% of entire portfolio/networth but the loss today still hurts nonetheless. 
Bitcoin has promise over the long term because there are no alternatives(except litecoin), so anyone that wants to invest in cryptocurrency has to buy bitcoins. It's not like stocks, real estate or artwork where there are 1000's of alternative places to put your money. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:22:07
oh no 
oh snap did he quit his job?
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:37:31
This is great PR for Richard and bitcoin
i hope more companies follow his heed
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:46:32
the sec will never approve this
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:15:21
to completely crash it has to go to zero
$5 seems like a good target
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:27:38
i think these coin companies are absolutely inundated with work from new accounts, orders, etc and can barely keep up 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:37:02
I would rather spend them on an investment like real estate than an ephemeral space trip
but i guess if you have money to burn go ahead 
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:33:35
they will not sell. the problem is unrealized losses are still losses. if you buy a stock at $50 and it falls to $40 yo lost $10 per share because there is no one in the marketplace willing to take it off your hands for $50 when they can buy it for $40.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:10:07
the volume has contracted considerably in the past day. usually this proceeds a breakout.

@_date: 2013-12-01 21:29:02
down we go again
no  shortage of these 200+ block sales
maybe we'll get a good bounce later this week..i dunno

not bitcoin..lots of implied volatility
either up a lot or down a lot from here
typically bitcoin rallies in 3-4 days spurts so tonight or tom. we're due either for more rallying or a plunge
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:30:05
Oh so it seems folks cannot withdraw mtgox funds so they are moving the coins to another exchange to sell at a lower price. So instead of 190 mt gox the true 'ask' price is 170 on bitstamp or some other exchange. I was not aware of this until now. thanks for telling me

the consensus is to store bitcoins offline 
the irony is that the most primitive way of storing bitcoins is the best way
my friend mined coins awhile ago and probably has them on the hard drive of his unused off-line computer
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:46:59
:Next question - why is there an artificially imposed limit on the number of total bitcoins? Why can't they just keep being released at a slow, linear rate to be more like the dollar and discourage hoarding?
because that is what distinguishes bitcoin from fiat; otherwise there would be no point to bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-13 23:25:33
I would have held on to them a little longer. I sold 2/3 at 300 and regret it deeply.  I since bought back some at 330 but still could have made more just staying pat. I had to sell when bitcoin started interfering with sleep and other activities. I would have just sold 1/2-2/3 since you will still feel good if it crashes knowing you partially dodged a bullet but you can still participate on further upside.

@_date: 2013-04-10 05:11:29
The author is wrong. A seller can sell as many coins at once as he pleases, withdrawing the money from mt gox, on the other hand has limits. It's not as bad as he is purporting.

@_date: 2013-04-11 16:41:26
A quick analysis of the crash report shows that roughly 30k coins were sold in the 60% plunge
If there were a 'reserve' on the other side to buy those coins at say, $200, a lot of this panic could have been avoided and merchants wouldn't have gotten burned. Bitcoin would probably resume its rally and all would be well. But those 30k coins out of a circulation of 10 million ruined it for everyone destroying over a billion dollars in wealth. Only 6 million dollars (30k times 200) would have been enough to save a billion dollars.

buy it in person. paypal, etc 
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:39:14
ideally store all bitcoins offline on a separate computer. make multiples copies, use multiple wallets, store in safe  etc
strong passwords wont always work with cookie stealing or if your connection is compromised so that's why you need the coins offline
if that's not possible or you're lazy then 1. don;t install any java, don't run java, don't run programs/extensions, dont 'cick suspicious links
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:18:18
Here is what I did:
.wired thousands of $ to mtgox (now regret it. don't ever use them)
there will be some paperwork and you'll probably have to meet with a bank representative in person. it's a pain in the ass but it's part of the process to confirm that you are aware of the risks.
after a week or so the funds will be credited. And then you can begin buying. 
CC &amp; Paypal  aren't suitable except for very small transactions. If you want to make a serious investment you have to go through the process of wiring funds.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:20:49

Ironically, for a high-tech currency like bitcoin the best storage is as low tech as possible. You want to create a  firewall between your coins and prying hands of the digital world.So that means NO online wallets, APIs, etc. Some people think it's a game or a toy. If you do don't complain when your toy breaks and you're out a couple thousand grand.
Only keep a little online for transactions keep the rest offline

over the long term it's going up because there are no alternatives to bitcoins/ it's not like real estate, stocks, or collectibles where there exist multiple alternatives. For example, there are 5000 stocks on the NYSE, thousands of artists, and thousands of neighborhoods but only maybe 2-3 important alternative currencies. If you want to invest in alternative currency, you have to buy bitcoin.
