Miners are playing the systems, jumping ship back and forth to where they can get more profit regardless whether they are actually mining empty block that do no good to the chains.

MyCelium works great on Android. I think there's an IOS version too.

I paid 2xx Satoshi and had to wait 22 hours, while others were done in 10min. Shit happens. Hopefully segwit makes things better.

Literally walks you through the process.

Feels like those to controls the prices now are traders. Or someone is trying to make BTC still profitable to mine to pull the miners back?

How long does it take to get 101 confirmations? Mine is at 600+ confirmation after 48 hours.  So the dump happens roughly a day after the miners switch sides?

If you are in for the long run, buying now or at $3000 doesn't matter as much.  
I suggest buying some right now, so you become more engaged to the ecosystem and then buy according to your experience.  There are so much more to learn once you hold some btc.

What is the buy price of your transaction in the holdings tab? 
By value to you mean Bitcoin's USD value?  Bitcoin value against USD fluctuates.  
Blockfolio USD value on the main page is based on 24-hour change. 
So you likely have bought BTC (perhaps a few days ago) when it is $5 higher than now, but BTC/USD had gained $26 in the last 24 hours.

Sentinel? The other one is in alpha stage.
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:06:52
I agree
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:51:47
Does the holdings tab show any clue?
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:42:41
Thanks. So, for now, I can only use Sentinel with my Trezor, correct?
Edit: Nevermind, Trezor doesn't even show the SegWit XPUB as there is no compatible app yet.

Not all crypto are made to function as Bitcoin. A lot of crypto are still under development. It is still the easiest to purchase Bitcoin.

If I exchange BTC to XMR and then back, would my BTC's history be wiped? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:33:04
Does it work with altcoins?
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:05:43
Shapeshift is not suitable for quick and reliable exchanges.  They sometimes use their own reserve of crypto coins to match your trade, and quite often the system "fails" when the exchange is to your favor (i.e. rally).

If you bought $50 dollars worth of bitcoin at $5650/bitcoin, you would get 0.00884955 of bitcoins.

Don't forget the forks are about to happen. After that it will probably tank.

They most likely want to retain control, and is also one of the country that is capable of such drastic measures.

Same here. deposit stuck since wallet is offline. BTC in limbo - not going to be in Bittrex snapshot and if I transfer it back to a private wallet, the BTG is probably lost.

Is 2x also such a fork? So in the coming months there will be gold and 2x forks?

Oh cool, so in a way, miners get the "mint" coins that have no history. Would these mint coins be more valuable in the future?
