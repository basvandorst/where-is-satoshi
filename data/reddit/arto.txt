At least at Room 77 here in Berlin, they don't bother with confirmations. The way the payment was done when I paid for a [burger &amp; beers]( the other week, the waitress entered the amount into their wallet app on a tablet, I scanned the resulting QR code with my phone's wallet app and pressed "Send", and the broadcasted transaction showed up almost immediately on her tablet. That was that, and I headed out.
Asking customers to stick around for blockchain confirmations (the first of which could take from minutes up to an hour, worst case) would just be bad for business.
If you think about it, the risk of a customer defrauding them with a bitcoin payment is not dissimilar to that of a customer passing them counterfeit cash. In other words, it's a potential cost of doing business, and if they're going to accept bitcoin, they have to accept the possibility.
That said, they likely estimate the current risk of that to be pretty low indeed, given that customers paying with bitcoin is not yet mainstream and their current bitcoin-based clientele forms a small-world network with useful transitive trust properties.

I was one of the many who donated, and I assure you that the donation (~$5 worth) I sent you was no play money to me. Its alternate value to me was, for example, half an annual domain name renewal or half the monthly cost of a shared hosting package.
One of the best things about bitcoin is how easy it makes donating. I find myself donating to numerous causes (from the Internet Archive to [Stefan Molyneux's cancer treatment fund]( to The Pirate Bay) far more readily than ever before. Not because the bitcoins are play money, but because it's so damn easy (a couple of clicks).

This is the best news in a long while, and bestows on the Bitcoin Foundation a good dose of much-needed legitimacy. Given the Foundation's direction during Vessenes's tenure, many folks had been becoming increasingly worried that the necessity of a fork (political or technical) was just a matter of time. Matonis taking over at the Foundation is a game-changer and should go a long way towards restoring optimism.

Having personally known Mike for years, and previously observed his efforts with the Bradley Manning Support Network, I will add my voice here as reassurance that this initiative is for real.
Not sure yet how I feel about all this, myself, but if you do believe in the [presumption of innocence]( perhaps we ought to give Ulbricht the benefit of the doubt regardless of the rather nasty allegations against him. Given such a premise, I believe Mike's initiative here is a commendable one.

I am not very cognizant of Luke-Jr's contributions, whereas I am highly cognizant of Matonis's since his writings convinced me to adopt Bitcoin in the first place. The reasons of others may differ.
Gavin apparently considers Luke-Jr a "poisonous person", which is stronger wording than what one usually hears him utter:
I am not familiar enough with Luke-Jr's past behavior to have an opinion on the matter. Obviously, though, Luke-Jr actively partaking in the present attempt to censor Matonis/Ver is not exactly going to help raise his esteem, generally speaking.

It doesn't even take any "skilled forensics people", just a halfway competent programmer or sysadmin who understands the relevant systems.
Given that, as GP says, we'll probably never know the real facts with certainty, since no independent and objective standard exists by which the veracity of competing claims could be evaluated and fact distinguished from fiction.
Whether DPR in fact ordered the hits or not, it's pretty obvious there isn't any actual murder victim, it would have simply been the FBI stringing him along. Thus this will just come down to whether one believes the integrity of the state apparatus or of DPR.

Whether or not the domain will in the future be owned by Sirius or the Foundation, authority is likely to flow through Gavin, as it does now.
The current delegation chain through which the website is maintained is Sirius-&gt;Gavin-&gt;webmaster. Sirius has not yet responded to this issue (he's reclusive these days) but has previous libertarian statements [on record]( Gavin has [expressed]( that he believes the process should be inclusive, not exclusive. The webmaster is at the moment [choosing to ignore]( this, even though his authority derives from Gavin.
If the Foundation were to own the domain, only the top of the delegation chain would change. And as I said, obviously the Foundation isn't going to be censoring its own board members. The situation would be improved on the current state, however, in that even if Gavin himself were reluctant to more decisively exercise his authority to overrule the webmaster, the board might be less inhibited in encouraging him to do so. They do pay his salary, after all.

Here's the forum thread: 
It's not the Foundation that's controlling the press center selection process; remember, Matonis is on the Foundation's board, it's not as though he's going to be censoring himself.
The problem is two core developers (unaffiliated with the Foundation) plus the current site maintainer for bitcoin.org. They are ignoring the clear wishes of the community and the press as well as the expressed sympathies for Ver and Matonis from Satoshi, Sirius (who actually owns the domain), and Gavin.
Unfortunately, however, there's not much anybody else can do about this unless one of Satoshi, Sirius, or Gavin chooses to more decisively exercise their authority to conclusively remedy the matter.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:01:25
Indeed. It's absurd that Matonis is good enough to serve on the Foundation and to be regularly published in Forbes and other eminent publications, yet not good enough be included on Bitcoin.org. His name is among the very first ones that I would have thought to include, as few others in the community can compare to his track record or his long-standing and ongoing efforts to disseminate bitcoin among the financial and general press.

I couldn't care less about DPR being a "drug dealer"; although even that is quite the mischaracterization, as all he did (unsubstantiated allegations aside) was run a website service that connected consenting buyers to consenting sellers. Many people I know used to get their "Christmas pot" or the like from SR instead of having to frequent shady street dealers. A good argument could be made, and has been made by many previously, that SR was a great benefit to society by reducing the systemic violence traditionally associated with the black market for drugs. All good in my book.
No, the only charges I'm interested in are the ones that concern an alleged murder-to-order conspiracy. If they happened to be true, I'd have trouble supporting this legal defense fund. However, I'm going to need something more than the FBI's word to believe them true, given everything anybody previously knew about DPR and his actions and ideals. It'd be hard indeed to support a sociopathic hypocrite, if he turned out to be one; but given how many such creatures infest the state apparatus, I'm going to give DPR the benefit of the doubt here. Therefore I do support Mike Gogulski's efforts to help secure an adequate defense for Ulbricht.

One of the better explanations I've seen so far:
Of course, this would still presume that the murder-to-order allegations have some basis in reality, instead of being fabricated out of whole cloth. If they do, that'd entail DPR being both evil and stupid, which seem contradicted by everything anyone knew about him.
Regardless of what the truth may or may not be, though, the powers that be have already successfully co-opted and established the dominant narrative, just as happened with the allegations against Assange. Just witness the hostility in Mike Gogulski's thread just now about setting up a legal defense fund for Ulbricht:
Never mind the presumption of innocence, the court of public opinion seems settled in its verdict; for now, at least.
