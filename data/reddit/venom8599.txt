Which is his point. When you're converting bitcoins to cash in the amount likely to be brought in by trafficking drugs, it's bound to call attention to the operation.

[DiabloMiner]( seems to be doing alright for me now, though it does use Java and can cause some moderate CPU usage (on my C2D E8400 it was hitting ~40%). Before some recent bugfixes it was throwing tons of errors for me though, so YMMV. 
I've been mining with 2 8800GTs and with this latest spike in difficulty I think I'm pushing the point where I'm barely breaking even mining, so I'll probably call it quits soon.

And now it's going back [down down down](

Pooled mining is advantageous in the sense that you can ensure steadier payouts, even if they are smaller, by pooling resources together. Otherwise, on my shitty rig (60MH/sec) the average generation time for a block is nearly 2 years at he current difficulty. And until I generated a block, I would get no payout at all. Then you can also factor in the difficulty increasing as more people mine and the wait to generate a block solo could be very, very, very long, barring the small probability of "hitting the jackpot" early.
Sure, you might be wasting a small percentage of your hashing power on overhead to stop cheating, and you might have to pay a small fee (depends on the pool), but you can at least have some payout instead of waiting to generate an entire 50BTC block all at once.

It crashes my system every time I cease mining--unless I disconnect from the network first and let it run out of work and stop hashing.

They don't even have a domain name yet, another big concern as to their legitimacy.

If someone mining solo had the equivalent hash rate of the entire pool, then yes.

Um. It's not showing up as a self-signed cert for me. It's signed by Startcom.

They've been going for between $9-$11 via Paypal on [Bitcoin Market]( today.

Bitcoinmarket.com has suspended BTC/PPUSD trades until further notice. Apparently there was some fraudulent activity going on using it. They were also running up against the limit for the number of emails they could send per day through Gmail, causing a backlog of the email "contracts" they send out and leading to a bunch of transactions not being confirmed after payment.
