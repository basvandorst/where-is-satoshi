When did you cash out? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:02:46
Bitcoin never spiked 5k in 2 hrs. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:17:49
Conflict of interest disclosures should be standard fare for any politician. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:01:42
Thaaaat's not how supply and demand work. Bitcoin mempool isn't the supply of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:55:46
You sound like every spud who never though btc would break $10. Or $100. Or $1000.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:34:11
The site doesn't have any record of the exchange between p2p? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:27:56
Or into a credit union that isn't a mafia? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:58:21
No, this is a captured regulatory agency. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:45:40
Better alternative to cash out btc? 
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:36:19
Yes if the price remained where it is for 2 years....... 
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:35:35
Uhh import/export laws would still apply regardless of your "feelings." 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:43:01
Do you currently hold your whole salary or do you spend it? That's what I thought. Stupid argument. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:24:02
300% more than the same time last year. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:01:46
This would require licensing their trademark. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:01:13
Agreed. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:29:00
It wouldn't be set in bitcoin. It would be set in USD. Another stupid assumption.
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:09:41
I'm all for bitcoin and am an early adopter (2011/2012) and I do spend my btc. But I'm also realistic about the implementation. Amazon doesn't give a flying fuck about 5000 signatures. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:45:35
No, your math isn't right. Because unless the sales volume of the bitcoin users *drastically* decreases their costs, there's no incentive to offer 5 or 8 percent off in order to make an extra few hundred thousand dollars. This is Amazon. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:58:39
Then you're negating the *potential* savings (no charge backs) with a guaranteed loss (discount). 
@_date: 2014-10-01 13:07:42
People said the same about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:11:08
Give them time :) 
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:04:11
This is not @_date: 2014-09-30 13:31:33
That's an average across all merchants and markets. Not indicative of a single merchant's risk. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:40:06
Potential savings because the fraud loss figures are average across all industries and adding bitcoin won't reduce the already occurring credit card fraud. It will only reduce the fraud within the new payment method. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 12:57:45
Amazon serves an entirely different market. You're not going to replace led tv sales in Amazon with knockoffs from China. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:15:28
Wrong. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:53:28
Can you resave this like 5 more times and just totally destroy it? 
@_date: 2014-09-25 15:58:52
Same price as bestbuy and I didn't want to wait for/risk shipping so I picked up locally. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:00:22
Everything has an exchange rate. Btc will stabilize in the future. It's in its infancy.

I will not do business with a company that treats customers so indifferently. I hope they see this thread. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:11:58
Do you get paid a salary daily? I thought not. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:23:48
No, it doesn't. It could literally be 1 person making 100k wallet transfers. Not that it was, but an increase in transaction volume doesn't have anything to do with the number of unique users. That's like saying more hits on your website equals more unique visitors. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:15:25
Fraud doesn't constitute 5% of online sales. Or it shouldn't. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:34:53
Can't we start early? 
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:19:33

Maybe for iOS but android has the app "bitcoin" which is a local wallet. I guess leaving coins on your phone unsecured does make it risky. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:55:49
Right? As if Amazon would then be compelled because 5k people said so. Do ppl not understand how fucking BIG Amazon is? 
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:50:17
In my case, overstock did not have comparable LED tv's plus some had hefty shipping fees. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:53:27
"Accept btc and save on credit card fees, then take that 3% savings and give us two more as a discount. So now you're losing money to accept a payment method you weren't sure of in the first place."

Glad OP acknowledges this as a fault of the banking system and not of bitcoin :)

Burden of proof is on wikileaks the moment they legitimize the question with an answer. Especially after the mismatched PGP signatures. Still unexplained.

They can close your account at any time and you'd lose your coins at the mercy of their judgment. 






@_date: 2016-11-28 22:51:10
Proof of life isn't difficult and Assange hasn't provided any since early October (when he was last physically seen). He hasn't even signed a single document with PGP. 
Also the hashes on recent wikileaks release do NOT match their original signature and they haven't explained that yet.

Again, that is not correct. You're using the easy examples as if they were indicative of the protocol as whole.
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:45:20
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:42:19
The public ledger provides a fraud proof system. An open, public, auditable ledger. The ledger provides NO identifying info. 
Governments are moving to force those companies selling btc to be "licensed" as a means to de-anonymize the ledger. 
If they succeed then you:
1) buy btc from a source that requires your ID. 
DONE. That's the only step required to de-anonymize your section of the ledger and taint anyone you do business with. Otherwise you can track btc all day long but your wallet address doesn't have your name attached to it. 
Unless your OPSEC is poor. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 14:58:43

* eBay is *not* getting rid of PayPal, it will remain a payment option.
* You wouldn't receive Bitcoin as payment, you'd probably receive USD equivalent.
* eBay is likely doing this so they can get a bigger cut of your sales. Right now PayPal is earning that roughly 3% and eBay wants a bite.

Thanks I will update today. I don't use it much and only got the update notice last night. 
Is there a reason why, after resetting it, the transaction and the Bitcoins would be gone from the wallet? I get the transaction should be missing as it didn't transmit (blockchain wasn't synced at the time). The balance is what it should have been had the transaction posted, which it didn't. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 03:24:34
Or if you were murdered for having it.
