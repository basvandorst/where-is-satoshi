So no, your balance will not be ten minutes out of sync. It will be up to 24h out of synch and HFT should not be affected.

We're all paying for it. No one ever promised this was going to be a free trip to the moon.  
  
I just hope this does not go to waste. Another chance for an investment like this may not happen in our lifetimes. People treat way to many things as granted or disposable. Including time, engagement and passion.

Now why would that be so? The numbers of naive and ignorant will likely increase with further bitcoin adoption. Do you have some sort of belief that being involved in Bitcoin makes you special? Are we going to make everyone engaged, honest and special by giving them Bitcoin?!

That's it. The other "features" that are somehow ignored in the debate. bitcoin xt is not about the block size, yet all the attention has been drawn towards it  
    
To be honest, the fact that we need to deal with this proposal and the way it was presented (gradually, obfuscated and with a questionable agenda), is disappointing and sad, but was inevitable. If Bitcoin is to survive as a self-policing decentralised network, if people feel strong enough to build something for themselves and maintain it without a central authority, then we will deal with this and further the decentralisation and network strength.  
  
If we don't deal with it and move towards the more centralised approach of giving the power over the protocol to two people, then maybe the whole idea was doomed from the beginning as it will prove that you can not rely on people's honesty, transparency, engagement, good will or ability to reach a consensus.

This I did not see coming. Now when they get hacked, there will be no question whether they will reimburse customers.  
  
These guys claim to set the industry standards. Yet, we don't see exchanges follow with solvency reports despite the demand.  
  
Coinfloor is a tiny exchange and they do this for the peace of mind of their users. I can not imagine, that Bitstamp or Bitfinex can't afford to match that.

Abstracting from this particular situation this may very well be the right approach but considering the current status of Bitcoin, how the economic majority developed and how quickly the situation can still change, I'm not sure if this could work out.  
  
Either way, the decision making process and parties involved should be public and transparent. That's important. The voice of economic minority should be heard to make an informed decision. Otherwise the economic majority can unconsciously make a call in a strong disagreement with the minority and ruin the whole operation. An unilateral hard-fork could ruin the whole operation. This is not yet a trustless system.

Don't you think we should be able to unlock our coins without support? If a legit buyer was affected due to suddenly being offline or paralysed and the money did arrive very late, then it should be up for a dispute / correction.

People forcing their solution on a world wide network may seen evil?  
  


  
Now here lies the problem - "proactive". Proactive in what? Solving the issue or using the issue and lack of straight governance rules to his (and his peers) advantage?   
  
But bottom line, I agree. It's pretty basic. You get attacked by germs and viruses to develop immunity or die.

As much as I strongly support transparency and proofs of solvency in the bitcoin industry, I'm not convinced about this model. Not mentioning whether BitGo is a trustworthy third party in this setup, I'm not thrilled with the public segregation itself. An exchange should allow for anonymous trading. But now you will not only know who deposits and withdraws but also who trades and what volumes. From there you can match users, analyse activity, etc. Is that what we wanted?  
  
Furthermore, I'm worried that this approach will enforce bitcoin's problem of non-fungibility. Will it not?

302 is the number of people who held bitcoins with coinfloor at the time of generating the report. I don't know if with this level of obfuscation it is possible to determine how many of those balances show in every report are how many are unique every month. Then there's people who probably hold balances in pounds and not in bitcoins, people who withdraw bitcoins asap.. So all we know is that there's min 302 active users. Unless someone has any idea how to decipher these reports further.
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:31:24
By "active" I meant using the service in any way, including storage. When it comes to visible ongoing activity you have the trade volume, but that does not give an idea of the number of users which is what we were discussing.   
Thanks to the transactions in the reports you can quite easily see the volumes of deposits and withdrawals. It should be possible to get the number of users depositing bitcoins, not such an easy task with users withdrawing bitcoins though.
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:40:15
I wonder how many of Coinfloor's customers go through calculating hashes to confirm their balance. If none, than it's a weak proof of anything.  
  
However, assuming that these proofs are valid (and I don't see any activity in their transactions that would suggest otherwise), the data from these reports looks interesting:

Simple. If you want to put £100 into bitcoin:  
  
on coinfloor market  
get **0.5447 BTC** in 5 min
  
on coinfloor exchange
     
best case scenario with HSBC fee + deposit fee   
get **0.5126 BTC** if you made the payment 3 days ago  
  
average case scenario with Barclays fee + deposit fee  
get **0.4063 BTC** if you made the payment 3 days ago

I think the problem lays in the storage and access to information overall.  
  
When I tell people about bitcoin they expect to find professional, recognised platforms with plenty reassuring reviews. If they are convinced that they've found a legit place to buy it's all good but then they're left with storage and too much information that is hard to interpret.  
  
My mother keeps her bitcoin on the same exchange she bought them on and wonders every day whether she was right dismissing the "never keep coins on the exchange" advice even though she trusts the company she stores bitcoin with.  
  
Once there is a widely known solution to bitcoin storage that does not require tech knowledge and bitcoin platforms are more developed and get proper recognition outside the bitcoin world, an average person will be a lot likely to invest.

PKO = the most old school bank in Poland.
LHV = the most modern bank Europe.
  
It is my understanding that LHV is looking to provide cryptocurrency-specific financial services for crypto businesses and they want to somehow use the blockchain to improve traditional financial system. Plus they do have this cryptocurrency consultant so at least you can be pretty confident to avoid misunderstandings. Your developments can actually be appreciated rather than seem suspicious.  
Seems like quite a difference to me.  
  
I bet that Estonia has loads of business limitations that Poland doesn't have, but a bank understanding and supporting Bitcoin must make things a lot easier.

Thanks for the "summary". Obviously this was not a quote of OP's title and you seem to be missing the point. **A man** acted in direct opposition of their MoF and will likely get into trouble for doing so in the bank's name by sending this ridiculous notice. 
  
I am not ignoring the fact that "banks worldwide are doing this every day" but I'm against unfair generalisations.  
  
It's just worrying how quickly people are willing to form opinions having so little information totally out of the actual context.

Here's a translated quote from 


So a bank branch manager in a small town in the far south end of Poland is having problems interpreting the law or even understanding the Polish constitution. That's it. One account was shut in this black hole of Poland but what you react to are catchy headlines! "POLISH BANKS START CRACKDOWN ON BITCOIN!"  
  
In 2013 Polish Ministry of Finance made a statement (per request) that the State does not recognise bitcoin activity as illegal and will not look to regulate it unless the citizens request customer protection or the EU tries to regulate it. I'd say that's a pretty chilled approach and I do not expect this country to make any moves that would deter existing business ;) If it wasn't for EU they'd probably already be the Bitcoin paradise.

Is 47.000 PLN (12.678 USD) a significant loss for them? I don't think so. The account has been blocked in a pretty standard way for such circumstances and they have recovered the funds on the next day. So I don't think saying the accounts were "deleted" is accurate...
