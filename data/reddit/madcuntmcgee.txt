ty for the help man

Wow. So by their logic any discussion of anything that might have the slightest hint of being drug related is worthy of removing you from class and hindering your education. That's pretty fucking retarded.

No it isn't. It's nowhere near as fucked up as syria, sure, but think about all the wars the US has either funded or initiated purely for its own interests in the last 60 years. I'm not some anti-american, but america is just as fucked up as many places, just in a different way.

Yeah, well, I find it hard to believe that they are so god damn stupid that this thought hasn't occurred to them. They probably are under the impression that bitcoin is used solely for buying drugs.

Yeah I think at the highest level there's obviously corruption but the school admin are probably just conditioned their whole lives to believe that drugs are these super scary evil things that will instantly turn a person into a cock-devouring, homeless, violent, mindless criminal. And so they treat it in that zero-tolerance way because they are trying to protect the kids. And also to protect the schools reputation so it doesnt appear to be 'soft on drugs.' 
It doesn't come from a bad place I think, but it is totally fucking dumb.

Just because there is probably a 3 year old getting raped while watching her parents get beheaded right now somewhere in the world, doesn't mean we should just cast aside all less severe issues as trivial and unimportant.

It's very nice to see a politician with some common sense. Good on you!

i really think bitcoin won't take off until all the people working in finance who can't grasp it because they were born way before computers were a thing die off.

I doubt you would be able to convince your employer or the government to pay your super in bitcoin. I guess you could ask your superfund to invest your money in bitcoin.

Yeah he was clearly the guy running silk road, I just don't consider that much of a crime unless he did actually try to kill somebody.
@_date: 2015-07-02 01:50:23
Yeah it is clearly more understandable for authorities to go after him than back page.
@_date: 2015-07-02 01:05:03
The thing is, those DEA agents who stole all those bitcoins were directly involved in setting up that whole murder for hire thing. I don't know about you but I would like to see him get tried for that in a court of law where he is at least allowed to bring up the fact that the undercover officers were corrupt before saying he did or didnt order a hit on someone.
@_date: 2016-09-30 09:13:52
not only will they not defend him, and likely skip the part where he wasn't allowed to mention dodgy aspects of the FBI investigation in his defense, but they will probably claim he was a murderer and that BITCOIN IS AN EVIL CURRENCY FOR DRUG ADDICTS AND TERRORISTS or some such nonsense.

If you are planning on using batteries for ecigs please do not buy them from fasttech.

When it comes to criticizing the US government, yes. When it comes to anything to do with Russia, not so much.
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:01:22
Did you test their amp load?
@_date: 2015-04-20 06:36:39
They are not quality... They are fakes, that's why they're so cheap. If you push these batteries too hard they will explode. However if you are literally just using them in a flashlight then they should be fine.

comment threads can get pretty technical here and that puts a lot of users off i think. Me included.
