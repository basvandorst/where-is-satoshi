Honest question: Do meshnets rely on at least one member of the mesh being connected to an ISP? Or is it more like an intranet between the users? If the latter, how is it useful unless the entire world is on the same meshnet?

Thumbs up. I couldn't agree more. The fact that the demand is outgrowing the technology and resources currently available is on one hand exciting, but with a shadow of unsustainability. I think cooling off until they can handle the boom is a necessary step for coinbase, despite the frustration of feeling left out during a dip.

Yorrick is right, one of the first things you learn in economics is that correlation does not equal causation. Just because the two events look similar doesn't take into account the circumstances that caused the fluctuations (which, in this case, are apples and oranges)

Its high risk, and tonight it might be the cheapest its been in weeks. If you believe that bitcoin will grow, then buy now. If you believe bitcoin will crash to the ground, then put your $500 in a low risk mutual fund. Its your call, and your risk. Keep in mind that this 'crash' is still up &gt;100% from nov 11th

Its not about having an alternative economy, its about addressing a problem. With the US losing AAA rating a few years back, and the national debt growing, how long do you think the strength of the USD can hold back the inevitable collapse of our overexpenditure as a nation? Now i'm not saying that bitcoin is the definitive solution, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have a plan B

If you're in the U.S., go to  create an account, verify a US bank account by choosing the method where coinbase will deposit two small amounts into your account, wait 3 business days for the funds to show up, verify your account with coinbase, then buy.

Go ahead and print out your bitcoins to an offline wallet if you need a piece of paper to justify tangibility. And "Stable economy".... clearly you have not witnessed the CAD overtake the USD over the past 3 years, not to mention the looming mountain of debt that is the most terrifying bubble out there

no problem, good thought exercise.

You sure changed your mind quickly!

You're right that in retrospect its very useful to understand what caused certain trends, but the circumstances have changed a lot since april 2012, so its hard to say whether or not the same patterns will emerge

Speculators can easily be turned into customers, at which point its no longer speculation!

What gives the $20 in your pocket value, besides the person at the bank saying it has value? Value is in what you can get for it, and someone just bought a very real tesla S with bitcoins

It wont reduce the debt, but it allows people like you and me to decide to put our money into a vessel who's future is not determined by decisions of our politicians.

Sheep implies you blindly follow the norm. So you're saying that trying to break away from standard money conventions is...the norm?
