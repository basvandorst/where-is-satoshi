It was foreseen, that one day, a smart person would write in r/bitcoin and preach the word of truth. Today the prophecy has been fulfilled.
Really, I have been lurking here for some time and I can't believe how delusional everyone here are. Thank you for restoring my faith in humanity and the fact that not everyone is willing to blindly jump on the bandwagon they ultimately don't understand.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:28:22
I just wish everyone was smart like that. A lot of people are currently wishing they had never heard the term "cryptocurrency".
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:27:15
If you refuse to see it, you refuse to see it. When the tether scam falls, so will Bitcoin.

That are checked at the counter when I use them. Listen buddy, we can go on and on, but I think you already lost the plot.
This thing is just full of holes, like almost everything in the crypto space. Better just call it quits here.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:58:40
It's just a thing that crypto nuts say. It's not to be taken as fact.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:12:31
I have no doubt that that's possible, but are you ready to distribute these machines everywhere where you expect these notes to be used?
I am thinking your use case is more of a hand to hand between private people rather than a client - service provider transaction? If so, how could I, as a private person, check the validity of the note?
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:57:01
Ok, so when I pay with a 20+ euro note, they always check it with a machine to see it's not counterfeit, but who checks yours, how and at what point?
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:01:08
Still better than bitcoin, haha ��
@_date: 2019-07-18 06:28:21
You said dollars.

If you can not see the benefit of taxes to the society, then you are just thick as fuck and that's all have to say about that.

You seem like an intelligent one.

Well, that theft got you things like roads, electricity, almost all of the public services that you use.
And even if you don't use them, don't you think its fair to help others who might not have enough to afford those services on their own?
@_date: 2019-07-07 08:33:47
No he isn't. Just look at his history. Grammar changes wildly from post to post. When he is trying to fish for money, there are more typos etc.
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:12:32
Yeah, I have read my fair share of how the banking system works and I know how there are rotten apples in every basket. I just don't think the banking system is as bad as you guys make it out to be.
I certainly don't think Bitcoin is an answer to any of the issues you just mentioned.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:41:40
I could retort that with saying that if you believe that the release of currency in to the economic system is done mostly by cartoonish evil villains who print money for themselves and their friends, then you are quite high on the 'conspiracy theory nut'-spectrum.
@_date: 2019-07-03 08:13:27
Wow, what a burn. Dude, you made an idiot of yourself back there. Might as well suck it up and not do shitty ass comebacks like this. It just makes you seem more pathetic.

Do you know where those gazillion dollars come from?
That's right, from your pockets.
@_date: 2019-07-29 06:23:36
It's always a "they" in this sub. People here are convinced they are fighting a great evil and that they are winning. They are not and they are not.
Also, facts are not necessary. Just repeat what you read somewhere else.
My suggestion is that you try not to confuse the crypto believers because they get mad quickly.

You too man, you too.

@_date: 2019-07-07 20:46:26
You are the one who offered the solution "don't be a dumbass". See how that works out for you when you accidentally are a dumbass.
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:49:46
Yeah, you are right. It's not gonna happen and for the most part, it shouldn't happen. People make mistakes, lose keys, money, wallets whatnot and in those cases I'm happy to know that there is someone keeping my dumb ass protected. With crypto, no such thing exists.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:46:00
Just stop the act. I'm not buying it, and luckily, some other see through you as well. Too bad you can still cheat some gullible suckers that don't know better.

That's exactly why you come here. Every time you post, you are begging for money. So please, crawl back under the rock you came from and stop trying to fish for donations on other people's suffering. You truly are scum of the earth.
@_date: 2019-07-09 15:03:18
Did you even read the article. It's pretty damning evidence that tether is just being made out of thin air and used to pump Bitcoin price. Basically, fraud. And you are just ok with that?

Wow you are stupid. What the fuck kind of cartoon criminals do you think the world consist of? "I'm out of cash, so I'll print some more, heheheeee". Jesus Christ. Think a little.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:21:25
It's so funny that the whole crypto space thinks banks are bad, and with the next breath you advice people not to trust the exchanges. I mean, is that progress?
@_date: 2019-07-03 08:09:40


No you didn't. If you did, you would have sold at the top and bought again at the bottom. The options here are that either you are bullshitting (this is it), or you are an idiot. Pick your poison.
@_date: 2019-07-29 06:35:22
Oh my god you are one of the biggest idiots I have ever seen. Your argument makes zero sense.
@_date: 2019-07-07 08:32:53

Now imagine the same scenario with a crypto exchange.

@_date: 2019-08-22 03:00:18
That happened.
@_date: 2019-08-28 06:27:32
That would mean there are shades of gray. Idiots love black and white. Banks bad, bitcoin good.

@_date: 2019-10-12 13:21:56
Oh no, next year I can only buy 99,6% of what I can buy today!
Sounds pretty far fetched if you explain the spending economy with this. It's because our lives are empty, new stuff is cool for a while and capitalism requires never ending growth. Bitcoin does nothing to change that. All it does is move power from people in suits to people with neckbeards.
@_date: 2019-08-23 08:36:21
So... basically brush it aside?
@_date: 2019-10-08 13:00:10
Yeah, greed is a bitch.
Edit. Oh, and a lot of the things that make us great, like education, health care and social security are all funded by taxes. We all carry our share to the pile and in the end it serves us all.
Guess we just live in very different realities.
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:14:39
I love the quotation marks around crash. As if losing 20% is not a crash on any imaginable meter. Maybe it will bounce back. Maybe it won't. It's still a crash.
Edit. Got my percentages all fucked up because stupid brain is stupid.

That's not... what the butterfly effect is. The butterfly effect means that you change your avatar and due to that, a bridge collapses in Portugal. You can not predict the effects. That is the whole point of it.
Then again, you probably own bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:38:39
I used to think it was interesting. Then I spent some time reading up on it and thought meh, I'd rather have the reliability of a bank for my money.
Bitcoin solves nothing. It replaces a system controlled by people in suits to a system controlled by neckbeards. Capitalism is the bigger issue, but I have no solutions for that, so I'll just shut up.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:55:55
Going to jail for a bitcoin scam.... yeah, not gonna happen.
@_date: 2019-10-08 05:34:03

@_date: 2019-10-07 20:24:43
Or if you bought at ATH, you would have 30% of it left. Your choice.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:05:44
But hey, according to the "scarcity = value" logic that would mean that the last bitcoin is worth a gazillion dollars! It's like musical chairs. Just be the last one hodling and you are the single powerhouse of the world economy.

Okay, be a fucking retard.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:02:47
Bitcoin fixes this in a way that when an exchange decides to exit scam, there is zero chance of getting anything back ever.
That's better, right?

@_date: 2019-10-07 22:09:24
Let's say there is an off chance you go to jail. You serve your couple of years and now you have millions and millions of money. Sweet deal, no?
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:10:00
Well how can the exchanges ever exit scam if everybody holds their own keys?
Hint. a lot of people don't.
And no need to tell me they are stupid for doing that. We all know. It's just that that's how people work.
@_date: 2019-10-31 06:16:42
It only took you 10ish years to figure this out?
@_date: 2019-10-25 05:59:46
I was thinking the exact same thing.
@_date: 2019-10-21 22:57:13
You have to be special kind of fucked up to spin this around.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:39:28
I pay like 33%, but I'm happy to pay it. It gets me and others the services and infrastructure that we need for a pretty good place on this earth. I might have objections to how the tax money is spent sometimes, but I think that's universal.
I had this conversation with another American a while back and realized that we have very different cultures when it comes to taxes (among other things).
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:15:39
You kind of accidentally said that here are benefits to banks. You might want to edit that before the believers find this.
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:32:53
I see "quantum resistant" in this sub all the time, but never an explanation to what that means. Maybe this should raise some red flags? But then again, what do I know.
@_date: 2019-10-08 10:47:47
Well, that sure convinced me. You could have also said "quantum resistant" because that's another synonym for "I don't know".
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:01:03
Same, same
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:06:07
How does it undermine the things you mentioned?
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:18:08
What do you think the dispute will do? You got fucked. Sooner or later everyone that buys bitcoin gets fucked.
@_date: 2019-10-12 13:12:08
The exchange CHARGES you to purchase bitcoin!? That is insane!
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:20:26
What kind of utopian bullshit was that!? You think there is any trust left or any market to "absorb" after everybody loses their money?
@_date: 2019-06-30 06:23:39
Because it's well known, that the crypto ecosystem and it's users are 100% legit. No scams here.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:51:31
It results in whatever it results. Historically it might have resulted in a price increase, but I honestly think there are no more bigger suckers around, which means no more money coming in.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:38:32
You are right. The same is true for everything. It's just that with gold, there is a higher chance you get your money back. If you like good odds, store in... I don't know, platinum? If you like to take risks, store in BC.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:22:53
I'm mostly here to observe delusion and idioticm.

So, by the logic of "there will only be so many, so it's deflation by nature" the current value is 5/6 of what it will ever be.
When hundred grand bitcoin?

Yeah, that was my point.
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:34:27
Tell me, how does the math explain the recent price drop? When people cash out, how will math guarantee you get 100% of yours back?
Backed by math... jesus christ.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:18:58
I like paying my taxes. I got lucky to be brought up in a stable home and worked hard In my life and got rewarded. Others did not have the benefits that I did and I think it's only fair that some of my money goes to help those people.
Crazy, right? Thinking of others before yourself.
@_date: 2019-10-31 06:19:13
Would you call that... Centralisation? Silly me, of course not, even though it totally is.
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:45:21
First off, the attitude of "let's worry after it's too late" would not get you hired as a cryptography developer. We avoided issues at Y2K because a lot of effort was put in to mitigating issues before shit hit the fan. Granted, that's being done in regards to quantum threats, but that's beside the point at the moment.
Yeah, we are all pretty fucked when the first cryptographic algorithms start to crack. Issue is that none of the proposed solutions are actually viable (yet), except symmetric keys, which are not suitable for any sort of large scale exchange of data.
The issue ALSO is that by adding qbits, the calculating power of the quantum computer increases dramatically with each one (as do the problems). With enough, any of the current algorithms in use are breakable within seconds. As to when we get there, that's up for debate.
It's just funny to me that a lot of people just say quantum resistant as if it's a thing.
@_date: 2019-10-08 05:32:45
Zero deductions, because I'm lazy and I earn way more than I need. Believe me or not. I'm not like you.

OP should listen to you.
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:44:20
You think you have it figured out. That's naive thinking that only a "know it all" teenager will do. I was the same.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:47:02
Is it? Is it really?
You americans are a fucked up bunch of people. Everybody just looking out for number one and fuck everyone else. If there is a loophole to be exploited, you push others over to jump through first. Not a care in the world for anyone or anything else.
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:59:53
In short, if you have N qbits, your quantum computer can be in 2^N states at the same time. If you know how computing and brute forcing keys work (basically trying to figure out the two components of an addition from the result) it makes that very, very fast.
Ok, your turn.

This is exactly why I frequent here. Biggest collection of idiots that I know. Idiots, who think they are smart.
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:40:37
Because there is no need for support. You already have their money. As an exchange, your job is done at that point.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:37:01
Of course, it would make prices of things funny though, if everyone just had a handful.
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:01:51
Yeah he is.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:16:13
I don't think you understood the point. Intentionally, or otherwise. What if your car explodes and you need a new one? Not now, but after the next crash.
If the price is low at that time, too bad for you. You are not going to be happy with your "store of value" at that point.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:20:52
I think gold is bought in a similar way to Bitcoin. Basically you give your money to some party that then holds the gold for you and all you get is a certificate saying you own this and this amount of gold.
Does it sound like something you would be comfortable with? Probably not, because there is a risk that there never was any gold etc. Or maybe the company goes belly up. Who knows.
And herein lies my issue with Bitcoin. There are no guarantees that I can cash out. All this hodl talk just leads to the situation in which it's basically a balance of terror. If people start cashing out, the value crashes and the ones left holding the last bags are the biggest losers.
I say no thanks to that and I'll choose something else, like starting my own company and making the wealth I feel I need that way. All in all, I'm not a sucker for money, so I don't even need a store of value if I just spend it all ��
@_date: 2019-12-27 10:22:31
And yet, here I am in Finland where we pay progressive taxation and enjoy one of the highest standards of education and health care in the world. Sucks that it's debunked though.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:41:59
On mobile and no time for lengthy reply:
We are in the same page. Stocks, gold, BC. They are all risky in one way or the other. The difference between us is that you are sure of bitcoin's success and I'm not. That's all it is.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:25:13
Do you think the super rich people in the world today made their money by gambling, or by long term investing?
My point being that a lot of people are _again_ going to lose a shit ton of savings when the crash happens. That's not how you get rich. You go for the lower return and lower risk.
I know a lot of you don't see it as a risk, but it's still worth thinking about.

So, as you went on some rampage instead of answering my question, I'm just going to assume you don't know how everything (or anything) would work in your tax-free utopia and you have no idea what you are talking about. Have a nice day.

His "well written retorts" basically boil down to "nuh'uh", "you are wrong and I am right" and ad-hominem attacks. But he agrees with you, so you agree with him. I love it how simple minded you people are.

You are arguing sensible facts to a bunch of monkeys who are just here to be convinced that their shitty lives are shitty because the government, the jews, the taxes, the illegal immigrants etc. etc. etc.
These people have not thought about anything for too hard or for too long.
@_date: 2019-12-27 09:46:17
Oh you are so naive it's funny. Free market providing goods and services at the price people are able to pay for it? They are providing them with the highest possible price they can.
Remember when the price of AIDS medication went from 13.50$ a piece to 750$? because of free markets. Supply and demand baby. I bet you would not be all about "no taxes, huzzah" if you had to pay your life savings for a surgery.
Americans already have pretty much privatised health care. Seems to be working fucking awesome.

A relative easy fix, which they have not bothered to do. What does that tell you about the platform?
@_date: 2019-12-16 09:29:55
Everybody in this sub is arguing that bitcoin is the solution to everything. You are the minority.
@_date: 2019-12-27 08:16:57
Yep, the youtube algorithm has figured you to be someone who could be fooled by those ads. Wonder why.
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:25:08
Sure they are. That's why I'm not investing in stocks either. I make more than enough to live the life I want and that's what I'm happy with. I don't have the same greed for excess that a lot of people here seem to express.
Not a pessimist, just not stupid enough to risk my comfortable life in things that have scam written all over it.
@_date: 2019-12-16 09:28:08
The point I was making that to you, bitcoin seems to have enormous potential that is going to be realized in some undetermined time in the future. Not now, not tomorrow, but some weird time in the future, because... things, I guess?
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:35:38
Loyalty, that is only hanging by a thread of bitcoins. That's deep.
@_date: 2019-12-16 08:56:37
You didn't come off intelligent. You came off as someone trying to convince themselves of something, disregarding facts.
That's not smart.
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:12:36
Yes, they clearly are. Bitcoin being manipulated again by 20% in one hour and all you can do is go "bull market, lambo!" Good luck my man, you are going to need it.

Disagree whether or not bitcoin mining and actual industry is comparable in their usefulness to mankind. Did you not read the conversation? You just said it was mental barf and I decided to take this little trip with you to see if it was going anywhere. It wasn't.  
I sometimes like to come in here and see what kind of reactions I can stir up in a community that is so goddamn sure of itself that it starts to resemble religion. A community of people who are unable to entertain the idea that maybe, just maybe they might be wrong about it all. Maybe bitcoin is \_not\_ such a good idea and a revolution in economics. I guess you could call me a troll.
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:21:43
Are facts getting in the way of your retarded pyramid scheme? How much did you lose so far? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:58:20
See, thats your problem, that's this whole community's problem and why you are the laughing stock of buttcoin.   
" That would take at least 5 years in the stock market." All of you are looking to get rich quick and not realizing that it only happens to the very few and the very lucky. If you REALLY want to make money, you have to put in that fucking five years, but no, not you. You are so much smarter than everyone else and not understanding that everyone else around you thinks the same.  
Damn. Talk about sheep thinking they are wolves.

Fools like me? Fools that don't like playing the lottery, because any fucking tard can calculate the risk/reward and see that there are better ways. Something that you are clearly incapable of doing. And you are so sure, SO SURE it will happen. Only an idiot is sure of anything.
Let me tell you why people take these chances. Because deep down they know it's their only option for "the good life".
@_date: 2018-11-08 06:21:25
Oh My god can't you come up with anything better? Really? You really are the perfect example of a retarded Bitcoin advocate. It gives you value, because you think you know things now. You don't.
@_date: 2018-11-07 18:31:30
Jealous of what? Not taking stupid risks with my heard earned money? That's what you believers always flag everybody who disagrees. "Oh they are just jealous and bitter".
No, we are just making fun of people who take massive chances on something they do not fully understand.
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:26:26

@_date: 2018-11-07 15:23:19
All you are doing is playing musical chairs with money. Everybody puts theirs in and tries to time their exit perfectly. Others win, others lose. Most end up losing 
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:54:08
This is just "i feel" talk, but I really, really don't think the statement that most are here for monetary change is true. Hell, I was excited about bitcoin maybe 4 years ago and I still do think that an unregulated and easily usable currency is the future, but this is not it. This is just not it.
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:43:16

Guess some people just love hitting their head against a wall.

Most secure does not impossible to attack make.

@_date: 2019-05-11 07:31:09
I'm on mobile, so won't bother writing too much, but honestly, how often have you had issues with either of the points you made? And you must have heard of issues moving tokens around, right? I don't think crypto currency is solve either of these issues, if they even are issues.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:26:48
Do facts leave you stumped?
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:48:33

@_date: 2019-05-25 16:23:05
You say all these things about how the world is a terrible place due to the current system and financial systems failing individuals, but I honestly think that is not the case. Not for the majority of the people who actually have something that they can turn in to money.
I'm from Finland, I trust my bank. I cannot remember a single case where someone had any issues with their bank. To me, all the issues you talk about are issues with the government, not the way money is handled.
To me, it seems like you are looking for a use case for something that does not have any.
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:59:45
Yes, your denial is funny.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:45:05
People have money they want to invest. They decide crypto. They look at the options and spread their portfolio over 10 different coins/tokens whatever. This means there is less money in Bitcoin because they diversified. And this is why Bitcoin would be worth more without other options floating around.
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:03:14
\- Way more hardened. What does that mean?
\- BCH is just a shitcoin and no one cares. Denial and glossing over actual issues.
\- Attacking is impossible because of hash rate? Hash rate, that is in bigger pools that could pull of the same attach if they so wish.
\- They would not attack because of investment? Why did the BCH miners attack even though they did the same investment?
\- And the best part, Andreas "the authority" glossing over the conserns with "we will work around it". Meaning, he has no solution and he completely glossed it over and nobody blinks an eye because he added a laugh track on the video to cover his shitty jokes.
Bottom line: you guys are planting your heads up your asses at an alarming rate.
Edit. Line breaks and a remark about how he jokes about "it would need a government that can do IT." Oh, you mean like the government that developed a whole plethora of highly sofisticated tools for spying on people online? The tools that Edward Snowden leaked? The same government that can spy on laptop cameras, voip phones etc. all over the world?
The NSA has much, much, MUCH more capable people working for them than the well-intentioned techno hippies working on the bitcoin core.
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:48:28
This is not going to be a popular comment. Sense is not something these people understand.
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:13:40


This is what always irks me. People keep saying this and at the same time you have so many leaders. Look at the posts on this sub. The titles are always "Andreas said this" or "Bitcoin core has decided to...". There are leaders. Also, the fact that China does all the mining. Would they not be considered to be in control in this case?
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:47:10
And when someone steals your bitcoin, you will be here crying "Why didn't anyone protect me!?"
You have to understand that there are a lot of people who get scammed etc. and there have to be safety nets. If you think you are above that, you are a fool.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:13:44
Was that honestly your counter argument to a valid concern? Keep your losses man, you deserve them.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:23:17
Oh come on. You know I'm right. It's hard to admit, I know, but it's a growing and humbling experience.
Would you rather:  
A. Invest in a crypto, expect wild swings back and forth and maybe be able to cash out at some point, unless it went to zero or your coins were stolen from an exchange etc.
B. Invest in a fund. Risks are still there and the profit margins are much smaller, but you have a good chance of not losing it all.  
And for the second point:  
A. Use cash or direct payment. Get your product or order confirmed immediately. Have the backing of the credit company you used in case of fraud.
B. Use bitcoin. Look up the prices for the transaction. Wait an undetermined amount of time for the confirmation and then get your product or order fulfilled. Have no security. If you got scammed, too bad.
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:37:41
And then there are the talented and smart people. The ones who worked hard, got the raise and think that a steady climb is better than big swings all over the place just hoping to catch a break.
The people, who have the confidence that they can have the life they want with just playing it safe and don't need to gamble for their money.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:40:18
You know why it was a bubble? Because people started making decisions based on hype and bad advice. A lot of people lost a lot of money. There are threads here for sucidide hotlines because of this. You never know how you might affect others, even if it seems like a passing little sentence for you.
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:44:04
What is it backed by and where does it come from? Please, I'm all ears.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:23:44
They have to believe. Otherwise they are down their life savings. It's just the belief keeping them afloat now. Smart people see a bubble for what it is, the stupid hop aboard with all they have.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:13:17
Well, it means it's a terrible store of wealth and terrible for payments. Understand now?

I really feel sorry for OP. People make mistakes, and anyone who says he is stupid for making one, have not yet made one themselves.
It's just that when you invest in bitcoin, this is a scenario that can happen very easily.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:47:35

@_date: 2019-05-25 10:32:59
I might be petty, but this is the exact reason I come to this sub. I watch idiots rationalize their behaviour, thoughts and the things happening around them in the most creative of ways.
This is why "this is good for bitcoin" works as a joke. It perfectly captures the essence of the cult. Nothing bad ever happens, even if the thing that happened was thought of as the worst possible outcome just yesterday. 51% attack on BCH? No problem. Never gonna happen to Bitcoin. Impossible!
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:24:36
With Uber, at least you got a ride from place A to place B. With Bitcoin, you get nothing. Maybe some fiat if you cash out at the right time.
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:35:59
I think you are the one who does not get it, but we could sit and argue till the cows come home and it would not make a difference.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:09:59

@_date: 2018-12-13 08:30:11
Hahahahaaaaa!!! You think they KEEP the crypto!? No business owner would be so stupid. They use BitPay or some similar service. They take your crypto and the service keeps a small slice and pays the business in regular fiat. They just lure you in because you think they "support crypto currencies" and you are stupid enough to think that they really do. Jesus.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:45:35
Tell that to the guy who lost his house. Oh, and tulip bulbs come to mind, smart arse.

Pfffft. You don't need to worry about that. Let him worry about that. All you need to do is buy and hodl, like a good dog.
Edit. Honestly, you were the first intelligent person to pick up on the fact that the solution was to "work around it". Which means he does not have a solution. He just glossed it over. And nobody upvotes you. This community is just fuuuuucked up.

And you thought this is a good counter argument? You are a despicable person.
@_date: 2018-12-17 06:40:50
"In game theory and economic theory, a zero sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants."
And cryptocurrencies are exactly that. Sure, there might be benefits like safe transfer of currency etc. that you could see as value on top of the money you put in, but that's not why you or anyone else are here for.
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:07:59
He can, but why would he? As a business owner he wants to minimise risks to his business, one of which would be the fact that he could lose that small portion. The money would be much better spent in growing his business in other ways, because I believe he has much more faith in his own business than the rise of Bitcoin.
However, as an individual he can do whatever he wants with his salary.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:26:48
And that's your argument?
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:27:44

Would upvote more then once if I could
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:52:10
Do you think Bitcoin would be more valuable if there were no other crypto currencies? Yeah, thought so. You can sit your stupid ass down now.
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:43:20
Yeah, and for most people it is a much better option. Including most people here, who do not fully understand what they are getting in to. There are so many people buying all kinds of lottery tickets hoping to get rich when the real way to riches is hard work. I guess it's because most people realise that they don't want to work hard and earn things. And that is sad.
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:18:59
Why not invest in something low-risk? That is if you just want returns for your investment? That is clearly a better investment than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:41:09
Savings = money left over after you deduct running costs from your earnings.
