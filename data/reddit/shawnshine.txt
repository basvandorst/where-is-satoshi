Facebook + messaging + money = terrifying.

You really need to consolidate. “Getting new wallet codes from sites?!” No. Pick one wallet (not an exchange, like Coinbase, but an actual software or hardware wallet for which you alone own the keys. Send your earnings to that wallet and keep it safe. Coinbase has a “Send” button, and you would just paste your secure, new, consolidated wallet address in that field and send away.

Around 2:00 into that video, he mentions that you need a bitcoin wallet to send your earnings from Nicehash to. He mentions that you can use Coinbase for this. Is that what you did?

People still use Hangouts?

I personally hate GreenAddress, but it’s one of the few open-source wallets for iOS that supports Segwit. Sigh.

Coinbase is an exchange. You don’t own the money if that’s your only wallet. Please move your money off of exchanges and into wallets where you own the keys.

It sounds like you were given a public BTC address by an exchange. That’s a web wallet. Is that what you have?

Anyways, go ahead and get yourself a secure wallet where you and you alone own the private keys. Hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger are recommended, or mobile wallets if you prefer not to spend anything. Samourai is popular for Android, breadwallet/Airbitz/GreenAddress for iOS. Electrum for desktop computers. Create a wallet, store the keys (WRITE THEM DOWN AND KEEP THEM SAFE - THIS IS YOUR MONEY). That's step one.

That's what I'm curious about... where did you get that address? Is it an address that Nicehash gave to you?

May I ask what kind of wallet you are currently using (the non-CoinBase one)? A mobile or hardware wallet, where you own the keys?

Love this authenticator!

How come? Do you prefer Tutanota?

Are you in SF? I saw an ice cream shop there that accepted Bitcoin last summer.

So use an encrypted password manager, like KeePass.

It's an encrypted mail provider.

I adore breadwallet, too. But I wondered if there was an open-source alt that supported SegWit, while not being overkill (like GreenAddress).

I’ve always wondered why people use Venmo. I’ve always been a Square Cash guy, and I’ve converted my circle of friends. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:18:23
Venmo, as a sort of social network with a public feed of your friends and their transactions, has always seemed bizarre. Sure, you can set your profile to private, but Square is basic and intuitive compared to Venmo. Plus verifying my bank account with Venmo took ages, and several transactions have taken upwards of 3-5 days. Square Cash is almost always instantaneous.

What do you recommend (for iOS)?
