Perfect answer, thank you :) 
WarpWallet's final, 20 BTC bounty had sparked this question. Considering brute forcing the pass phrase is a difficult task (2.517597860831e+86 possible pass phrases), I was thinking about all the ways people are trying to get in.
Again, thanks for the link!

I believe I linked to the $649 machine, not the 30K one. 
Interesting point about difficulty. I couldn't find any calculations predicting it to get that high. And yes, I should've said that providing the current difficulty of mining, it would pay for itself rather quickly. Of course difficulty will go up, but this would still be a safer investment compared to a GPU rig.
Thanks for the info.

Yeah. My first goal would be to pay off the rig, and with current prices, I don't think it would take long. After I've made that money back in CAD or USD, I'd feel more comfortable, as the only way to lose money would be by spending more on energy than I'd be making in BTC. That sounds reasonable, yes?

Very good points. I guess I'll hold off for a good while, until I can see what happens. Thanks!

So difficulty will go up with these machines mining, correct? How does one calculate the difficulty?

Let me rephrase your rephrasing of my question: Providing that BFL does deliver, would it be a good investment? 
@_date: 2013-02-20 00:57:31
Yes, that schedule. If it changes, I guess I'll review my plans.

Say if it shipped on their estimated schedule, and was delivered by the end of March.
