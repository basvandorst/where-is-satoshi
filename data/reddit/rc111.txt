I bought at 95, 135, 120, 400, 1100, 680, and most recently 580.
I have no regrets except for 1100. I should have known that the risk/reward ratio was bad on that one. I use paper wallets and create my private keys with physical entropy on a machine that has never touched the Internet. It's a bit of work, so once I send stuff to that cold storage, it stays.
I'd be such a fool to sell right now.  There is a constant stream of merchants accepting, projects launched, code open sourced, venture capital flowing, and talent moving into the space.
800 per coin will be cheap again; the trolls are wrong.  Bitcoin is becoming more useful every day by the work and capital of a lot of people and that will be reflected in the price in a matter of months.

Dave is an incredibly gifted speaker with wisdom to share.  If middle and lower class Americans followed his financial advice, a majority of them would be better off.
Even on Bitcoin, Dave nails it in some ways. He identifies the risk as inappropriate for most of his audience and his terminology of "Bit con", while false, is an effective sound byte to keep people out of speculating in something they have no business in.
Now for the criticism: Dave is a man who speaks of integrity literally every single day.  He might not know it yet, but he's feeding a lot of downright false information to his audience about Bitcoin.  I bet he doesn't even understand that [B]itcoin is a payments network and [b]itcoin is a currency.  To speak so confidently about something he does not understand is hubris and does not help his audience.  It's not WWJD, which is a principal I think Dave sincerely values.  Dave, like Warren Buffett and all the other traditional conservative investors, is not too dumb to understand distributed digital currencies. He's just relying on his well tuned "gut instinct" which is not perfect and in this case wrong.

It's been like 2 months since the last bubble.  If you can't wait longer for than that for the next wave, *nothing* will satisfy your growth expectations.
Why will Bitcoin be worth a lot more? Because the market is sitting at about a 10b dollar market cap and that's peanuts.  If the technology succeeds, the market has to be much, much bigger.  Banks, for example, can't effectively use it as a transfer network unless there is far more liquidity.
Do you think Bitcoin will ever solve the problems of inter-bank settlements (which are slow and run on a cluge of various black box dated platforms)?  I think it has a pretty good chance in this space, but not with a 10b market cap.

Investors are going to want to know what gives it value. They understand that dollars are legal tender, valuable for paying taxes and settling any debt.  Commodities have an intrinsic (non-monetary) value for at least a fraction of the market price. And stocks give you ownership in a company with assets and revenue.
Bitcoins are strings of numbers and letters on paper, in your head, or in a digital device.  Why do we "magically" trade them for hundreds of dollars?  gave the most elegant, straightforward explanation on this subject I've ever read: 
Explain to your users the difference between capital B Bitcoin and lower case B bitcoin (or BTC, the units of account). Then they will be ready to evaluate the value of Bitcoin -the network- and bitcoins -the thing needed to issue a transaction on that network.

His power and influence are not easily transferred into power and influence on the Bitcoin network. For new features, he needs influence over core devs. For control over transaction confirmations, he needs hashing power. For control of the protocol that's actually running, he needs to have a majority of nodes accept it.

When economists talk about *intrinsic value*, they often mean *non-monetary value*. Under that definition, I think they are right: gold has some baseline non-monetary value due to the usefulness of its physical properties.  Bitcoin has no non-monetary value as far as I know.
However, I'd like to hear a good argument why a money with some fraction of non-monetary value is desirable. Of course it gives the money a baseline value &gt; zero... Is that all?

So it's fine by me if Bitcoin has no value to Peter. (I will probably never need to make an exchange with him anyway.)
When he says they have no "intrinsic" value, it seems he is saying *other people* ought not value them as much as they do, or maybe that the value depends on things *apt to change*.  I'm not sure what he has in mind.
Peter could point out that gold is physical, that it does not rust, etc, but Bitcoiners could point out that digital currencies are [insert something unique].  The "intrinsic" qualifier is just a way to sneak in assumptions about whatever the speaker happens to value.  
If Peter has something else in mind, I hope he will say so in his debate with Eric Voorhees @_date: 2013-12-05 08:35:46

A friend, lets call him John, asked me to buy and secure his coins.  I bought them last week and now I need to safely hand them over. 
I know about paper wallets, but I've never made them for someone else.  This seems tricky... **I want help John put his coins into cold storage without me having any access to his private keys when we are done**.
Here's my plan:
1. Setup a laptop and printer at John's house. No internet connections.
2. Boot a Linux live CD and load bitaddress.org [from a USB thumb drive](
3. Make 10 paper wallets using bitaddress.org [BIP38 encryption](  **Leave the room to let John type his passphrase and click 'Print'**
4. Send John's coins to his new paper wallets. 
5. Explain [change addresses]( Suggest that he [write the passphrase on his paper wallets]( when I leave.  (The passphrase was just an extra measure of security against me and my printer's cache.)
That's all. Please tell me if there is a better solution.

Matt, Do you think your colleagues understand that Bitcoin is both a currency *and* a useful payments network?  
Ask them what gives a bitcoin, one unit of this currency, value in relation to a dollar?  Do they think it's "faith" on the part of market participants? Or do they understand that the utility of a *global, decentralized, pseudonymous, payments network* will push demand of whatever can trade on that network?
Critics need explain how they think the Bitcoin payment system will be less useful in the future, because if they can't, they don't understand this space well enough to criticize it.  There *are* some worrying scenarios that would damage the usefulness of the Bitcoin network.  I just never hear outsiders bring them up.

Most people are not, and never will be, ready to be their own bank.  My few coins are on paper wallets made from 160bits entropy from a physically random process. I understand change addresses and the keys have never touched an Internet connected device.
Even after all this, I sometimes worry that I made a mistake... That I will wake up one morning, check my "watch only“ addresses on blockchain.info and see that some jerk more technical than me found a way to steal my money. 
I'll go on Reddit asking what the hell happened and they will say, "did you do X?" No - was I supposed to do that? “Yeah, totally. Without X, you made a big mistake. Sux 4 u dude."
X is different things for different people, but the sickening result of losing thousands of dollars is the same.

It seems better to keep this public key unadvertised so that bot owners will be less likely to claim the money:  If they find the passphrase, we want them to see a zero balance and move on.

All the exchanges have growing pains or are poorly run, but overall they are actually getting better.  First, a few general observations without going into detail for any one company:
* Downtime is common, especially when the price is most volatile.  Day traders get burnt all the time because they can't cancel a stop loss, or place a trade, or get accurate real time data.  Market manipulators try to make this worse by hitting the sites and API's with distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks.
* Customer service is usually slow and sometimes customers are just ignored.
* Getting fiat in and out can take days, weeks, or months.
* Getting an account verified can take weeks.
"Which one is best" will depend on where you live and what you are looking for.  Mt.Gox and Bitstamp have some of the best liquidity (maybe BTCChina too), but you can't trade on margin or place a stop loss without using a 3rd party app.  BTC-e now supports [MetaTrader 4](  Bitfinex has margin trading and stop loss, but most of their liquidity is through Bitstamp and sometimes they run out of reserve funds.  Mt.Gox has been hit with this weird looping bug that stops all trading until they reset the system.  Some people must have lost massive amounts of money from that bug, but I doubt Mt.Gox will credit their account in any way.
None of the exchanges are very transparent.  None of them hire independent auditors.  When something goes wrong, like your market order gets stuck in the queue for 2 hours, you are probably just screwed.
With all that said, there are some new players coming to the market and existing ones I've mentioned are working hard to improve.

True/reliable stop loss would be great.  Adding a stoploss at a meta-exchange like Bitfinex is just asking for epic fail:
1. Price is at $200.  Enter stoploss = $185
2. Someone dumps 5k coins on Bitstamp and hits Bitfinex and/or Bitstamp with DDOS.
3. Bitfinex trade engine takes a few minutes to come back online and *then* my stoploss is triggered.
Yipee! That stop loss just got triggered at the absolute worst time.  It just sold coins at the bottom and the price will now recover.
