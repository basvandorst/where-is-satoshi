Using an altcoin tip bot is as much a publicity stunt for such altcoin, as drinking Kool-Aid is a publicity stunt for Kool-Aid. A person uses a tip bot because it provides a valuable service. It enables them to buy a beer for a kind, random internet stranger at almost no added cost.
Refusing the option of using said service to the users of your sub just because it *could* potentially benefit your competition is a very large stretch from moderation.
I would be the first one to use a Bitcoin tip bot, if one was available.

In your second entry to the same thread I linked, you were discussing how much simpler it is to express difficulty in bits, since then the difficulty of a block can be (roughly) determined by the number of zeros at the front of the block's hash without the need of a calculator.
This is true, but like someone pointed out on that thread and like you mentioned above, this has the drawback that difficulty can only be adjusted in halves or doubles, whereas Bitcoin needs more granular control over difficulty.
Your claim that you went through this thought process in 1997, when you were naively asking this question in the newbie forum at bitcointalk in 2013, is hard to sustain.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:27:30
funny how in 1997 you considered making difficulty adjustable in fractions - a *minor and obvious extension* - and figured powers of 2 were simpler, but then in 2013 you were asking on bitcointalk why on earth doesn't Bitcoin use powers of 2
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:10:18
Looks very clearly like an advertising stunt.
Don't think anyone reasonable would call this censorship. Unlike banning the tipping bot, for example, which clearly is.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:39:56
Node count is irrelevant. Specially 3 months in advance. Also, I believe BTC1 is not the only client that will support S2X (also Classic and Unlimited).

sorry for the newbs, whats the diffenrce?? I thought segwit was up and running already

OK, good argument buddy. I'm convinced.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:24:22
That's the slippery slope fallacy. 
Blocks are full &gt; Increase block size &gt; Demand increases &gt; Blocks are full &gt; Increase block size &gt; ... etc. Therefore, we cannot increase the block size because it leads to this unsustainable scenario.
You are assuming unbounded demand. Yet organic, economic demand is very much limited by adoption rates. And demand for blockchain space for non-economic activity is very much limited to specific use cases requiring immutability and transparency; for essentially all other use cases, traditional storage will be cheaper and/or more convenient.

Better than trying to predict the future, is actively trying to make it happen.

All major implementations are ready for 2x except Core. Also, given the nature of the changes, the disruption for wallets and other Bitcoin software is minimal.
Nodes running Core need to upgrade their clients to one that supports S2X, that's pretty much all that needs to happen. 3 months is more than enough, specially if you consider how fast the setup and initial adoption for Bitcon Cash worked out, in face of much more disruptive software changes.

@_date: 2017-08-22 17:40:45
In that post, he asks a question for which he now claims the answer is *obvious* and known to him 15 years in advance. I find that hard to believe.
The question of whether Bitcoin's difficulty is represented via a power of two (possibly fractional) or via a multiple of 2^32 is completely orthogonal to the question I posed, and explaining that numbers like 2^78.1 are well defined is merely an evasive to the whole matter.


And you are now starting to go down the path of insults, a game in which I will not participate.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:31:01
No, it's always been possible to do whatever you want via a softfork. You could, for example, only allow legacy blocks to contain the coinbase transaction and make fully validating nodes download an additional 100MB block with all the rest of the transactions. This would, in fact, achieve a blocksize increase via a softfork.
Of course, this would be silly and nobody is suggesting such strategy. Legacy nodes would not be cut off from the network, but they'd be useless since they'd only be able to see empty legacy blocks, missing out on all real economic activity.
SegWit does a less extreme version of this. It doesn't push full transactions into an additional block, but instead just the "witness data". This creates the illusion that legacy nodes are still somehow useful, when in fact they're still 100% dependent on fully validating nodes to make sure blocks are valid. What's more, it incentivizes miners to not fully validate blocks. Here's Peter Todd (Core dev) describing this problem more in detail: 
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:05:08
This is history right here, gentlemen.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:15:22
Of course you can raise 2 to the power of a non integer. Never heard anyone call that a "fractional power", but sure it's possible. It's also inconsequential to the statement put into question:


which seems contradictory with you posting on 2013 on the newbie bitcointalk forum a post with the title (in non grammatical English):


@_date: 2017-08-19 20:31:13
lololol classic newbie shouting out for protocol changes they don't understand
there is no such thing as "the" mempool. each node has its own, and there is no  coordination in the protocol to keep mempools consistent between different nodes.

I put his assertion into question and neither you nor him have explained why my logic is flawed. His response was giving me a 101 lecture on powers of 2 - which I insist has nothing to do with my assertion -, and you've added nothing but calling me a troll.

@_date: 2017-08-20 05:56:26
lol what does BCH have anything to do with this???
this is about the fork in November (aka SegWit2x). the trick you described works, but it needs average fees to be different on both sides to succeed. there's no reason to think that fees will be significantly different on the 2x side at first. at $2 per tx, you're burning money on both chains till you succeed.
not to mention that pulling off that trick is way beyond 99% of bitcoin users
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:10:11
You don't need to do anything for now.
Things can change *a lot* until November, and you will have lots of time and lots of warnings before the time comes to take some action.
No preemptive action makes sense at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:49:27
They're "supposed" to use whatever strategy they perceive will maximize their profits. Sometimes that implies mining empty-ish blocks.
If you want to change that, then you need to change the incentives. What you're saying doesn't work because there is no way for the other nodes to prove which transactions a node has actually received and how big its mempool is. Adding an extra protocol to estimate mempool size the same way the network time is estimated, for example, essentially opens the network to a plethora of new attack vectors.
And all this for what? To increase throughput by a tiny percent?
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:00:54
I suggest you try to improve your reading comprehension.
It's not a matter of whether fees are expensive or not. I most definitely agree that they are. However, the part that I don't agree with is that on-chain transactions **will never** be cheap.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:34:09
\&gt; Bitcoin is a great alternative for a vast majority of the world
\&gt; average fee of 7 dollars
\&gt; Seven-in-ten people globally live on $10 or less per day
I guess they have 3 dollars to spare if they do just 1 transaction per day
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:32:06


OK. Now you've proven you don't understand the Bitcoin protocol on a very basic level. I rest my case.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:35:57
You seem to have honest, good intentions so I'll tell you this. If you really think that miners are mining empty blocks to purposefully raise fees, that miners are attacking the system or behaving like enemies to Bitcoin, and that SegWit via softfork is "taking the impossible and making it possible", then I seriously suggest you reach out for sources of information other than this subreddit. You will find a bright new world out there.

That is just your opinion. *My* opinion is that given the tiny level of disruption that the upgrade entails, together with the recent developments, 3 months is more than enough time.
It's OK for us to disagree. The natural course of events will teach us both a lesson, for sure.

If adoption rate increased linearly, at the current rate it would take over 2 years before full SegWit adoption.

It's not really the same as doubling the supply.
They become two separate networks with coins that are not interoperable - as in, you cannot send some Bitcoin on one chain to an address on the other.
Saying that this is doubling the amount of Bitcoins is claiming that both chains will somehow still be Bitcoin after the fork, which nobody is claiming.
