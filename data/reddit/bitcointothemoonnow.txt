You're missing the point.
There's 1000 next big things. 999 of them end up broke. You only hear stories of the 1 that makes it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:11:01
it makes sense if you are a malicious actor intentionally trying to destroy the LN with spam.
But if you need a few sats per tx and the node can handle thousands per second, it would become expensive fast. I guess my question is, is the node TPS high enough to resist attacks?

The eclair wallet is really nice. I've gotten their testnet to work with lnd web apps hopping across multiple nodes in like 1 second

Looking at the Dapps page it's mostly simple games, chat rooms, and payment processors. But let's look past that for the moment.
Currency benefits from decentralization and censorship resistance and trustlessness and permissionlessness. But what program benefits from those aspects on the ethereum VM, in a way that cloud storage/computing doesn't already offer?
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:25:16
Do they do vpn too?
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:01:17
Manufacturing doesn't include r&amp;d for them to make the next bigger one, and cheap manufacturing of flash memory has super high failure rates. That's why 2gb drives still exist. They are actually just 64gb drives that have like 90% of their storage failed from the factory.
Us transactions are probably 10% of global tx so that's not a huge difference.
100,000 global nodes each buying one 1tb SD card a week doesn't sound like a lot to you?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:25:23
Yes... One mega tx from the exchange to load all the coins for their future customers at once...
Stop spreading fud lol

Did you get a cryptokitties alert? OK good bye :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:20:33
I've tried eclair wallets/payments but not node running. If you run an eclair node can you just jump on mainnet directly? Guess it'd make sense it could run on mainnet if they let you download a mainnet client.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:08:51
If you're concerned, why don't you Google transaction sizes and current transactions per week? Not hard to do the math yourself instead of just doubting others.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:38:43
I dunno you're the one that's already so sure it's all useless lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:12:10
Also batching can make that 10x cheaper still
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:34:28
This is why I don't like ethereum. Grand promises of "check out what the future might hold" but nothing is actually being developed. And if you ask what it can actually do besides cryptokitties you get insults.
If someone wanted to run a program decentralized, they can do it on their cloud servers. Cheaper than gas and no chance ethereum foundation will change it.
Why do you think DACs can eliminate embezzlement? Most embezzlement is people stealing office supplies or misappropriating funds in ways that are already trackable, it's just not possible to micromanage everything. Blockchain doesn't solve that.

Ok so each person wanting to only participate in Bitcoin via ecommerce will need 1 on chain transaction, ever... to establish their wallet and sync it's public keys with their funding source exchange. That's all though.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:10:37
Sounds like you aren't aware that nodes can interact with each other... Don't need a channel for each merchant.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:56:10
What Dapps are there besides cryptokitties and other coins?
Also what advantage does the eth VM have over AWS?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:04:15
The idea that every person needs to be constantly doing on/off chain transactions is ridiculous.
If someone only needs to spend a few dollars per year online, they will just buy lightning coins directly from an exchange. They won't buy on-chain coins then transfer them on.
Once LN is adopted and people can buy/sell lightning coins directly, I think that the blockchain will be used almost exclusively for cold storage and huge transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:54:02
How does the LN avoid spam? If someone has two wallets separated by a node couldn't they maliciously drive up that nodes fees by inundating it with spam? If it's 1000tps capacity it'd be a non issue I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:48:57
What happens when big blocks fill up?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:23:49
Coordinator argument aside, and lack of working wallets aside, here's the problem with IOTA:
It's not about the coins, it's about the tech.
If Samsung decides they like it enough, they don't need to buy iota and run an iota network on their IOT devices. They can copy the code and sell 'SamsungOTA' coins to be used for the exact same purpose.
It's not like bitcoin, where the value is in the scarcity of the coins and blockchain space.

@_date: 2018-01-10 14:08:18
For the less banked, I think purchasing lightning coins directly will be appealing. No one chain transactions, just stay on LN. That won't need fees.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:29:57
It's good you googled what batching is, hopefully you understand better now
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:59:03
Once confidential transactions on Bitcoin are out and accessible, monero may not be needed
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:34:10
Most other exchanges, merchants, and wallets are already doing batching. So it might take a while, but everyone else knew to do it years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:46:54
Anyone can run a LN node or even create LN software... What makes you think that?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:43:03
Gbtc was trading at 100% premium right before the 20k crash...
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:39:47
Right. The exchange loads 1000btc in one transaction, then sells it in .001btc increments on the lightning network for no text fees.
One fee, millions of users.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:04:50
Yes and yes
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:16:10
If there's only 5 merchants that accept it, it's pretty trivial for someone to make a node connecting them all for free...
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:42:21

You don't know how consolidating works, do you?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:19:24

Turing complete just means you can run a program on it. And again... Who's trying to run a program on a blockchain? What program would prefer that to AWS?
Your link isn't about people who want to propose a decentralized business... It's an advertisement/fan article about their existence. Just like your posts...

It's reasonable to assume that 7 billion people will be using Bitcoin (let alone even having computers) before lightning factories and other upgrades can handle them?
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:37:40

You can't spend a dollar that is being invested in stocks.
If your business is small and local and physical then you won't have use for Bitcoin for a while. So it's ok if you sit it out.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:13:47
I'd say the real problem is most noobs aren't even aware of the fees, and the ones who are think that just goes with the territory without any solution.

@_date: 2018-01-12 18:28:43
That's exactly how channels work. You load it into your lightning wallet so that you can send it to everyone else's wallet. What do you think the point of LN is?
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:22:48
Bitcoin has smart contracts. That's another currency thing.
Who in the world wants a decentralized corporation? Especially when you're trying to sell it to people who are already business owners lol.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:12:22
The difference is bankers can participate in Bitcoin but they can't control it. They can't lobby for inflation or redefine it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:01:08
Because you're an altcoin shill?
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:45:03
How did you calculate those odds, and why can't coin networks just interact with each other? Google play and iTunes aren't controlled by a music credit token and they seem to work ok.

Don't lie please. Batched segwit txs are dirt cheap. And exchanges can transfer your coins to LN for you.

@_date: 2017-12-12 16:05:59
I know I can run partial node and help a small bit, but Im a big believer in full nodes. They have the biggest power, and regular users need to retain the ability to run them.

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:19:41
It's not a bad idea, but running a full node is incentivized for high volume merchants anyways. Faster, more secure transactions.

@_date: 2017-12-15 14:33:30
I don't think many are buying it. No one thinks it's the future over even litecoin or dash.  Since segwit2x was called off I think Roger et Al are transferring lots of their btc reserves to bcash. At 12:1 ratios that buys tons of bcash and can sustain a lot of selling pressure.

Exchanges don't really even need ln yet, all they need to do is batch transactions to have the same effect. LN is needed for more than a single input/output flow, like webs of merchants and customers.

They're not points they're ramblings
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:14:33
That's something businesses and banks and exchanges can all implement individually, and small business money will drive to LN nodes quickly. It'll be much more competitive and incentivized than segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:07:33
Once LN is up they can just run a node

Yes you find someone who runs a node and upload to them. This is permissionless and trustless. You can get your coins back whenever you want, or keep them there to spend.
It doesnt matter who you want to buy from, your node will find a path to get there. Don't listen to all the people saying you need to connect directly with each merchant, that's the whole point of LN.

That sounds wrong. $15 is next block right now from nonsegwit tx, and $10 are clearing often.
Unless you post the transaction I assume youre lying.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:18:20
You can't run a node ok your phone but you can use a LN wallet just the same on mobile. I don't know where you got the idea everyone needs to run a node...
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:42:07
Segwit blocks are 2mb...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:16:36
No2x was about the corporate take over, not the technical issue.

Didn't you guys learn anything last week? We need to put 12k on rocket to establish meme support lines
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:05
What about institutional buyers using futures to hedge? Billions in buying.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:57
If they had segwit mempool would be empty given current transaction rate

I get that every tweet on mobile, just refresh

If he was rebuying lower I think the price wouldn't stay that depressed and would bounce above 17.2
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:26:48
Yes let Roger ver run the network and be the bank CEO, that's truly the vision of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:25:29
Yeah cuz billionaires are so generous lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:34:46
I was under the impression it was mostly changing wallets and upgrading their transaction code for segwit addresses, do you know if there's anything beyond that?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:54:31
You can trade it all now but coinbase only let's you withdraw 10k a week or whatever. But you can keep USD on their fdic insured cash bank account service.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:37:34
Yeah not even a gdax text on the wall or something lazy...
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:36:31
Right Roger says only he needs to run the nodes and no one else needs one anyways, keep forgetting that
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:48:41
Like what?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:14:16
They take high fees first, that's how we keep spam from inundating the network.
You can raise the fee from your wallet to get better time. However 231 sat might clear tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:27:00
But it's not centralized. Anyone can run a node.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:17:38
If you want to start small and easy, I would recommend just using Coinbase for the time being. Don't transfer it around until you're more familiar. Coinbase will let you hold it safely and securely before you know all the technical details.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:19:46
Use segwit and ask exchanges to batch txs
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:23
Hold and buy more at the dip
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:03:15
Only because no one uses it lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:52:25
Segwit blocks are closer to 2
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:34:11
For you special needs folks the OP dropped this:
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:25:45
Ok that's 8mb blocks down. But now a billion people are buying coffee. You want to buy a supercomputer for them?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:51:08
Are you against cancer research or pro taxes? Only one option in current state works, because we know people don't donate enough to fund it independently.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:45:22
You should read up on how nodes work before dismissing their role lmao
Typical bcash narrative - let Roger run the nodes for you, you don't need one anyways
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:56:05
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:19:08

@_date: 2017-12-01 22:58:17
Nothing in there addresses why the rich hoard more when taxes are low, or why the rich don't use their wealth to fund cancer research or road projects. 
It's all excuses and theories. But in the real world, the rich hoard and act selfishly.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:20:42
Your entire post is negated by the idea that people could buy Bitcoin on the LN and bank on LN. If they aren't HODLing or using big amounts, they can just skip the base layer entirely and let their LN processors worry about that.

No one can predict the price. If you want in, now's a good day.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:52:21
Because billionaires evade them and the govt doesn't actually get it. Trillions stashed in offshore accounts. Not taxes, not donated, not reinvested in infrastructure, just hoarded.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:02:15
None of them said that to me. Did nicehash say they were? Did you find reference to them in a BIP?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:57:42
That would be awesome, it would drive their customers to Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:48:12
No it won't lead to Centralization. LN nodes and exchanges can be decentalized, use atomic swaps, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:41:38
Someone told you Bitcoin has caused 2% inflation to USD? Might want to check your sources. Dollar tree nearby hasn't raised their prices to $1.02 yet lol

The next big thing is sharding.... Let's let people have 1% of the blockchain each lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:23:30
I misread his Q a bit but gdax and coinbase are same company so you can xfer back and forth
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:00:55
What do you mean hasn't come out? It's live on mainnet. All that hasn't come out is consumer-facing interfaces.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:06:30
At this rate, next month lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:16:02
Those uses make up less than 1%. The other 99% sits in vaults and jewelry, only because it has value outside it's utility.

How do you get the public key to load it tho
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:45:35
Yeah but litecoin and bch are both like homemade bootleg knockoffs of betamax someone made with a home injection molder.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:16:15
All the other exchanges are ATH right now, since they didn't get the 19k gdax spike.

Lol they are full of hatred

Shills. They call Bitcoin cash the real Bitcoin and refer to Bitcoin as Core or segwitcoin. It's phase one of the renaming propaganda.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:16:50
Check the 1000 other posts on this exact topic or try Google?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:06:09
But early adopters deal with wallet bugs and vulnerable networks that require relying on central devs to control everything. That's pretty much the antithesis of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:35:50
Devil's argument is it scales slightly better right now.
But it cant continue scaling, and it's centralized and controlled by a couple people 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:40:35
They would have to coordinate all of wall street to accomplish that... And each investor is out trying to make their own money.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:14:01
Their computer performs calculations to process transactions. There's good YouTube videos showing the process from start to finish, if you want to search for deeper answers.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:48:15
Yes in a heavily consolidated manner. Maybe one tx with the before/after states of 1000 wallets, for 2000 bytes. Instead of 5 txs each of 1000 wallets for 1,000,000 bytes.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:01:16
Ethereum is great if you don't mind losing your coins to hacks, bugs, or the centralized devs deciding to change the block chain.
I like my cryptos secure and immutable.

Vaporware? You can download the software they've used to transfer real bitcoins now.

LN is live on mainnet now. Just waiting for public facing software GUIs. Those are expected in two to three months.

Bcash is centralized, and has a crazy dude everyone let's run around saying Bcash is his project/business.

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:39:06
So I guess you're too new to know... Internal exchange transactions aren't on the chain. They keep it off book internally. Day traders and short term buyers/sellers don't affect the transaction volume. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:52:41
Centralization. Bigger blocks mean you need more powerful computers to run.
For example look at bch. It's easy and cheap now because they only actually use 0.1mb/block, but filling up 8mb blocks would require decent computers. Any raspberry pi or crappy old laptop would fizzle out of ram, and most US customers would run out of internet bandwidth to run the nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:59:35

If you go to Nigeria or a place with poor people and a few wealthy elites, why don't they have running water and roads on the villages? Why aren't the wealthy building infrastructure and advancing healthcare?
These places already exist. We can see what US would be like without tax funded utilities.

Crashing for me. Empty blocks happen sometimes, is it just 1 empty block? That's not a pattern.

So how do you get people to start using a system whose stability only arrives after mainstream adoption?

Who told you two years? They're testing it with real Bitcoin today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:02:25
The key is that whatever node is storing your balance, it's trustless. You can get it back any time no questions asked.

Incentives for segwit from merchant side are almost non-existent, LN is actually huge

Thanks roger
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:23:03
Yeah no one needs to run nodes except Roger and he promises he'll keep the network running efficiently and securely
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:07:31
First paragraph: that's what litecoin is. Same blocks 4x faster.
Second paragraph, node computers process more with bigger blocks, that's how computers work... More transactions means more data.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:52:12
Exchanges are just onramps. Once everyone is on (which could also happen with decentralized p2p exchanges) we won't need to be tied down to Fiat.

Ethereum is controlled by the ethereum foundation, who can and have made changes to the ledger and the ethereum code without needing community consensus. It's great if you trust them to do the right thing, but they are centralized and the ledger isn't immutable.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:20:20
Not about who suggested it, it's about who was trying to control the dev community and shoehorn themselves as leaders of Bitcoin. Like how bch has Roger ver saying it's his product and his business, and exerting who knows how much control on it's dev team.

Yeah hoping to get more than a robot this time lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:43:12
I'm addressing your gold argument but yes it's a currency too. It's currently undergoing growing pains due to huge adoption. Scaling efforts are already out and more are coming soon.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:45:32
So what is your proposed solution?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:32:28
Ah that sucks, didn't know they do that. Yeah you might be stuck with coinbases high fees to get it off.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:06
It has what is analogous to blocksize increases. It can scale linearly but not exponentially. LN is for exponential growth
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:41:21
Fuckin A man
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:46:39
You can stay in small nodes because nodes talk to each other. You can start on bubbas 0.4btc home channel and buy from Frank's tiny store because they will be connected through a few hops with bigger channels.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:50:31
Gemini seems fair but no segwit or batching... Still inefficient
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:13:28
No only sending address.

Use GDAX instead of coinbase, same company and free transfers.

Bitcoin dot com ask for Roger ver
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:15:31
I'm confident it will too, but people are already clamoring to pay $0.10 for a single byte on the Bitcoin block chain, it is incredibly valued. I want to see it grow as a currency, but it can survive as an investment vehicle and store of value very easily.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:43:28

Probably that whales will sell short futures then drop the price by selling btc. Aside from crazy, it's illegal.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:13:30
Segwit txs get weight discounts so they cost less to you and more can fit per block. So both you and the network congestion benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:18:49
This is such an obvious and efficient solution, I don't know why no one is doing it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:29:54
No one's stopping you lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:47:02
It's worked out pretty well for me...
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:53:21
If ltc gets their LN working right we can piggyback right? Same code base. Plus atomic swaps.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:13:13
It's not bad but it's not good either. Btc wouldn't get cheaper because it's so widely used.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:54:12
Any address can move to ledger. Can you see the address they sent from? If it starts with 1 it's not segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:49
Poor bag holder :(
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:36:17
Everyone else is saying they don't have segwit... Are you sure they do?

What happens when half of wall street is going long, like the billions in hedge funds that already are?

@_date: 2017-12-15 14:52:09
For noob users who don't care about technical details:
You need to migrate to a new wallet/address format, and are rewarded with cheaper fees. Fees instantly cut in half, and the more people use it, the more fees drop for everyone even further!
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:00:19
If you don't know how to set fees manually in electrum, you shouldn't be preaching. Try reading some sidebar basics?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:09:59
It's centralized and relies on devs making most of the transactions to try and prevent fake one's being pushed through

Please stop lying to the noobies. Segwit is a decent size increase and enables LN and shnorr signatures.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:13:18

@_date: 2017-12-12 16:36:05
Our LN is already live on mainnet, so it's unlikely, but maybe there'll be an instance where that saves btc a week or two
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:00:14
When it's 25k on big American exchanges. Gdax at least, bitfinex for 100%
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:06:48
We already raised blocksize with segwit. Let's get that adopted first. If it was being used by exchanges there'd be barely any fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:07:45
Biggest problem for segwit is native core adoption. That's not slated till like may. It's hard pressuring people to make risky and complicated moves before then.
Bitcoin isn't meant to shapeshift overnight, it's careful, tested, calculated. Speculation is crazy now but the tech needs to be solid.

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:17:47
Yes there's tons, a new one every week. Most of them are scams and ripoffs, and have wallets that might compromise your real Bitcoin. I'd say other than selling BCash, not to even try getting the others. Risk/reward is high.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:07:21

Yeah I keep hearing delay till 16.0 next year... 
But coinbase said they're actively working on programming it in.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:35:27
There's a 200 coins that "can" work but no one uses them practically... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:22:26
Electrum is free just need to have transaction mined. That price depends on segwit, batching etc
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:08:56

Wow advertising your own business using bcash hoping to get sales, Roger has taught you well lol

@_date: 2017-12-07 13:49:23
Yeah act dude bro about $20 gains is my strategy
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:42:08
I keep hearing that on Reddit but I can't find a source, and there are still threads complaining that they don't use segwit... Also no batched transactions... Got a source?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:47:05
They are working on it, it's on the front page now
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:59:07
Market manipulation
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:18:11
LN has much higher incentives for users, merchants, and even banks to implement. It'll be highly competitive.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:08:28
Why because of taxation?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:05
They could have but they didn't and the fork would have been cooped by figureheads like bchs ver and jihan 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:56:48
Your wallet provider uses inefficient transactions and higher fees than needed. Try swapping to a segwit wallet and your problems will be solved.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:11:05
So why did you only focus on self-transactions?

@_date: 2017-12-11 15:11:14
Your edited calculations for "max" LN capability are orders of magnitude above bcash. It's at least a good start. What can we do on top of LN without making nodes centralized?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:34:25
Well then it's peer to peer to peer
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:10
No it hasn't lol, the old joke was 18 months.
It's on testnet now and very close to done. It was first conceived 2.5 years ago.

If more txs per block won't clear up the mempool... What's the point of a blocksize increase?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:30:40
The foundation cam change their mind and the community can't stop them. That's called trust. Bitcoin is trustless.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:07:54
Anyone can hardfork Bitcoin. All it takes is 1 person with an "argument". Its existence doesn't validate the argument.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:03:43
I listened twice and can't find it. He refers to his website Bitcoin.com and it's sales but I don't hear him saying bcash itself is his.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:19:28
Yeah they should have given a bcash warning
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:13:48
In addition, you can download the Android eclair wallet. Its amazing seeing it go from your phone to the approved webpage in less than a second!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:00:57
Coinbase is intermittent at best now. My purchases won't go through.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:28:11
No one wants btc devs to take risks lol. Then you get shit like ethereums multisig bug.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:10:29
Why are you blaming stupid exchanges on core? The solutions are here.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:15:16
Those are unfounded fears, uncertainty, and doubt. Aka FUD
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:27:05
My point was that the foundation gets to decide max supply. And they can do it without consensus or hard forking.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:31:44
Like "save up to 15% or more " lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:43:51
Isn't the issue that it's "implemented" but not default supported until 16.0?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:20:22
As of this morning, the withdraw-only is still explicitly mentioned in a graph on their alt-coin page. I'm hopeful for it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:02:20
You know there's like 20 of those already for Bitcoin right ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:05:07
That or more frequent blocks, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:40:42
You avoided the question by saying they're trustworthy lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:35:22
No ln nodes are much lower requirement, rasp pis can still handle them.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:36:19
You should read up on LN instead of getting g news from bcashers
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:45:19
I'm not a large node I'm a dude with a laptop
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:53:09
LN is decentralized and trustless... Anyone can run a node...
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:18:23
Because at the same time everyone expects to have roads and clean water and cancer cures. But if we leave people to their own devices, none of those happen. Everyone hoards for themselves.
See: billionaires exist while malaria is rampant.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:18:46
Wallets are like your own private bank. You control it you are responsible for it's security, and only you can access it if you set it up right.
Coinbase could lock you out if the government wants money from you, or they could go bankrupt. But no one can take your wallet from you if it's safe.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:56:18
Because normal computers can't run 32mb blocks
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:05:38
Check menufy, lots of Bitcoin accepting delivery restaurants
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:27:48
They can scale 20tx per second, not a million.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:51:36
You can buy and sell futures without any requirement for trading or holding Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:26:40
Scalability is worthless if it takes away security or centralization, then bitcoins just PayPal.
So yeah "good" scaling takes care to not affect the important stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:07:36
My previous post was an explanation.

Btc doesn't have a group that can issue as many coins as they want or undo transactions on the blockchain...
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:10:25
That was a hard fork away from a bug super early on. I wouldn't compare that to the roll backs ethereum does because they get hacked, especially after having 7 years of Bitcoin to learn from.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:06:40
Yes. And they choose the worst way possible to do it, plus pad the fee with their own profit. 
They should be able to get your btc out to you for under a dollar, anything more is their mismanagement and greed.

It's a pyramid scheme and they're at the top. They want to inflate the worth so they have the most value.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:54:41
You should be looking up tx fees and current mempool estimates before sending such small amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:33:41
To add on to other comment square will likely have off chain purchasing. You can send and receive Bitcoin to other square apps and stores using square register, with. K fees and no waiting for train sections to confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:18:45
2x is good but there's so many txs waiting on the sidelines, that may not lower fees. Anything bigger and raspberry pies start getting the boot.

Why buy shitcoins when you can get the real thing
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:24:56
My theory is that Roger has been propping the price up by burning his stash. Trading his btc for 10-12 bcash each goes a long way if he stared with 100k. No one is using it, coinbase doesn't sell it, yet the price is staying up, that's the only explanation I can think of.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:48:16
I think this dude is one of the most likely Satoshi.
He lived down the street from the actual guy named Satoshi nakamoto, and he happened to be the first nonanonymous bitcoiner? No way that's a coincidence.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:31:25
When you call Bitcoin something other than Bitcoin, no one will take you seriously.
You can talk about bchs merits but fraud isn't going to get you anywhere.

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:33:38
Better to clear the mempool next month safely and efficiently, than to bandaid the mempool with a centralized or risky solution now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:31:40
It wouldn't cripple it because it's centralized. It has only 200 nodes all run on supercomputers and cloud servers by ver and Jihan. But you couldn't run a raspberry pi.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:54:21
Yes it makes it centralized.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:18:02
Wherever you go make sure it's segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:11:28
You should alert bcash users of these uses, they keep arguing about how useless it is for them to run nodes so long as Roger has some up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:29:40
They also support ethereum which does similar on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:12:49
It's a currency that's experience growing pains as it becomes massively more adopted.
Any currency would need to do this. Imagine if the whole world decided to start using Swiss francs online. Scaling is an issue, but a temporary one.

People think paying for roads and schools and healthcare is the worst thing in the world
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:55:11
Segwit is a type of wallet/address that upgrades how the Bitcoin transaction is processed. Many mobile wallet apps have not implemented segwit yet which forces you to pay much higher fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:17:56
Even now, tx fees are like 2btc per block (compared to 12 block reward). Block fees are a great way for sustainable security.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:28:51
No one is using it
Transactions are backlogged
Pick one?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:28:50
Let go of those bags man

It's a slippery slope. 3mb we lose the pies... 4mb we lose the old laptops... 8mb we start needing dedicated computers... 32mb dedicated servers... 
I would personally support 2mb now but no more until pies can handle it
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:45:33
Please don't lie.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:01:59
Stop spreading lies. One REAL transaction was sent on video, and more have been done in similar fashion. Millions of test transactions have been sent.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:44:59
I got mine too.. check their website. They sold it at 1200 last month.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:13
Try bitstamp. They will let you transfer coins with 99% less fees and better efficiency.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:07:06
Iota is only used speculatively now. Anyone trying to transact cam see coins disappear from their wallet. Devs are running network on their own transactions and manually fixing wallet bugs via email support to prevent spam, false txs, and other bugs.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:30:19
Check my post history, there's 3 bcashers this week arguing about how running my own node is worse than useless. They get upvotes and i get downvotes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:48:50
Ram and bandwidth yo. Bcashers don't know about that cuz they let ver run all the nodes. 100th time I've had this exact conversation lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:50:25
Ah :(
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:08:17
More frequent equal size blocks, or same time bigger blocks, have the same effect.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:30:59
Aside from segwit they should be batching txs too. But even if not, mempool is dropping. $8 nonsegwit is clearing now and lower will go through tonight. Plus 30% off for segwit discount.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:58:35
Sounds like you haven't seen LN in action
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:18:44
Permitted to, and able to buy 60bn of btc in a month are very different.
I think they will equilibrate at 3-5% premium, but it will take months due to demand.
ETF itself will probably drive price up, which again makes their equilibration harder
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:34:33
Should be soon. All the tests are working 100%, seems to just need customer facing software.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:18:25
Bitstamp. They have segwit and batched outputs, making them 30x cheaper than coinbase and others.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:33:26
No one could run decentralized nodes due to high computer and internet requirements.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:00:09
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:21:27
Software isn't available yet, they're aiming for jan-march. Testing is complete, just need to finish public-facing software.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:12:08
Yes and those collective entities are clearing their backlogs and getting to cheaper txs right now
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:56:10
This is a top tier shitpost here, I want to see this o
More lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:51
But they hold and stay long... Like the 3bn hedge funds already doing so.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:12:01
Sidechains run on their own nodes on their own software, separately from btc software. Those can also be run decentralized in very compact hardware on their own.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:47:47
It's in the next update. Dont worry.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:24:36
The whole community is built on running ICOs and the promise of running real things. See crypto kittens lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:11:43
No just that your wallet is segwit

Almost 1k above bitfinex wtf lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:05:41
Bitstamp? They use segwit and batched outputs so it's much cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:05:27
True hadn't thought of that. If atomic swap LNs are readily available I could see then both coexisting
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:18:39

Once theyre back up the biting will resume
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:28:36
ETH has sacrificed decentralization to require strong computers running nodes, in exchange for a bit higher throughput. Bitcoin has not made that sacrifice in order to remain decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:19:05
Thanks a bunch :). I'm trying to duplicate testing on the eclair android wallet. Do you know how I can send it from y'all's.org to the Android wallet? I only have the wallet address, not a transaction ID.

They will need to be set up (either through their own computer, or through a merchant processor like bitpay) to take lightning Bitcoin separately.
The goal is to make wallets and software more intuitive so people don't need to interact so directly with the cryptographic side of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:47:10
I think it's pretty naive to think all of wall street would conspire together instead of fighting each other like a bucket of crabs. Like they do now.

LN not secure source? Or did you make that up?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:53:01
It's regulated. Most financial advisors and wall street types aren't allowed to touch Bitcoin but they can buy futures instead.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:08:00
Every future has a short and a long side...
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:00:21
In bchs case, it's not. It causes Centralization and network vulnerability.

That's ok because it doesn't cost that much
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:44:11
I appreciate the sentiment but there's 2 big problems
1 - no great or easier on ramps
2 - they are raising fees for everyone else regardless of platform

None of the other cryptos' are both decentralized and working as intended.

Are you using a segwit wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:56:41
Source? Never heard of that and Google's not showing anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:56:07
That will be one way to do it, probably for less than a couple pennies. You can always do it the old fashioned way but blockchain space is getting more valuable every day so small transactions will be difficult on the main chain.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:08:41

They are misquoting coinbases blog posts. They have said they will allow withdrawals, and are "considering" further support. fake news.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:42:43
I don't know how many wall street brokers who trade futures you've met, they're mostly not the type to be giddy and post on 4chan about their new products. Especially when they are using money that's not theirs.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:38:10
If you aren't familiar with it, Google some articles or check sidebar here. It was a huge part of Bitcoin community history, too big to explain briefly here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:07:34
Are you using segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:59:45
Exodus is closed source and supported segwit2x. I prefer open source community supported projects like electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:08:16
100,000 noobs withdrawing every day from exchanges clogs up the mempool, especially since exchanges are not using segwit or batching transactions properly.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:16:20
Yeah your 2 minute old post was pretty useless
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:16:58
Electrum can. Right click tx and select raise fee.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:06:07
Yes it's not centralized and it's trustless
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:19:55
The guys a bit sarcastic but yes, multisig wallets require multiple people. You can have them saved in your will or other secure methods in case you lose it. You can also make a wallet that requires 2 of 3 people.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:55:29
I think you're talking about mining? I'm talking about nodes, not the proof of work process.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:33

That's a lot of unfounded assumptions
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:39:14
Why won't fees go down if everyone transacts off chain through LN? Many of us are excited to out our money into that and use it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:27:40
Lower fees, higher transaction volume without sacrificing security.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:25:28
Yes have to transfer it back to exchange.
But if you want to use Bitcoin as a currency, you can do that directly from the hardware wallet to send money to a merchant.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:49:09
The average Bitcoin transaction is $15,000 with a $15 fee right now. That's actually better than almost every other money transfer method.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:47:18
200sats are about to clear, that's $6. $8 is already clearing next block. Why are you paying $15, it didn't even get that high today lol. Next block fees peaked at like $12 at absolute worst.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:16:17
Lol centralized currency, why not use dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:44:11
Yeah exactly crazies like this that think hoarding a few dollars is better than curing cancer.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:47:37

Each small increase retains an "overwhelming" majority. It's a gradual decline, like the adage of cooking a lobster in water by slowly raising the temperature.

UK market is tiny though
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:13:46
But how do establish value if people are just trading it, without accumulating at least some as a store of value?
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:05:52
Yes it is... It's not centralized and it's trustless
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:29:40
Every time txs only cost 10 cents I do a ton of useless ones, and I know others do too.
LN will make it so you don't need to pay high fees for valuable blockchain space.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:21:28
Speculation? It's live on mainnet now being tested with real bitcoins. All that's needed is a software interface for normal users to interact with it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:14:17
Yes! Good loophole right now
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:02:26
Doesn't mean anything because the markets closed now. It'll jump up when they open.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:40:59
It's not alpha of development, it's already developed. It's alpha of testing.
What coin can handle a million tx per second?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:00:41
No it's a shitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:37:18
Again, 20 front page posts this week. Why are you spreading fud while knowing you're ignorant?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:57:06
They do have decent, active, and well intentioned devs but I think they number like 10% of Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:34:07
You mean market cap flippening?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:16:58
Bch is already inferior to litecoin lol, don't know why anyone would choose it
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:47:33
You know you don't need to pay $25 right? Use segwit, batch outputs, sub dollar txs are easy
But yes I agree LN maintained wallets are the way of the future for noobs and small customers.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:49:48
Yeah why not solve scaling for two weeks before running into the see problem again lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:45:01
You don't need a payment channel to the vendor, it will be found from wherever you are. That's the NETWORK part of lightning network.
This starts off with btc on LN. There will be exchanges/banks that will sell or maintain your LN balance, and nodes that you can upload your own btc for trustlessly giving you access to LN.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:13:18
Your lies got deleted so let me remind you, ln has been used on mainnet. You can do it yourself too, just no assurances it'll be 100% bug free from the devs.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:22:17
Litecoin has a bit more scaling, but Bitcoin has the better secured network and more decentralization. Bch has neither of those and can only compete with litecoin on scaling.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:07:55
Small miracles are on YouTube to be witnessed by all. Our personal miracles are being worked on and will be out soon.

Segwit is new, they're slated to include it as default state in next major update.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:15:01
Because on the LN you can spend without fees
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:53:18

That's two more coins than I need
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:23:27
It's live now. They just need to get software out to everyone for real use.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:37:12
My argument is people are too stupid to save for retirement. They need help or they'll face destitution. Society should try to prevent that instead of exacerbating it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:51
Ah yes thanks, edited. Still 546 sat is like 10cents now, good for coffee levels.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:34:38
Lightning network is in functional alpha testing today. Patience.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:48:55
As far as I can tell theres major confusion because they declared themselves "segwit ready" a year ago. But they haven't actually implemented it. Also no batched outputs, which is even bigger of a deal.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:49:18
Lmao "4 days in a row means forever"

One that all the first time noobs coming here don't understand.

Fees are high because it's the only coin that works as intended lol. Ethereum multisig, iota wallet bugs...
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:25
Nicehash is part of bitcoins network?
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:52:06
What do most store their wealth in? Average Americans don't have stocks or index funds, that only starts at middle upper class.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:47:21
Lightning network is already working... Just needs consumer facing software and a couple bugs.
Core devs don't have very much power over Bitcoin, even if they wanted. Don't need to have any trust in them.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:09:51
Yeah tons of consolidating and whales exiting, and price has held.
Inoortant to remember coinbase has a backlog of a million people waiting for verification and increased limits, all waiting to plunk down a couple hundred a week.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:55:40
Low taxes = productivity and job creation?
Thats Reaganomics. And if it we're true, we would see high taxes coincide with hoarding, and low taxes coincide with productivity and job creation. But we see the opposite across history.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:06:37
Correction already happened
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:36:31
There will probably be lightning exchanges pretty fast. You could keep your small Bitcoin amounts on LN, or buy it there. Your friend could receive and store it on LN for free or receive it in a batched outputs onto blockchain for a small fee.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:18:57
You and a million other people... That's why it's not crashing lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:27
Lol triggered much?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:27:03
Exchanges are working on it now. It'll be default in a few months, and LN can immediately piggyback off that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:09:41
Coinbase puts your buys into their wallet, and you have to pay transaction fees to get it off them to your hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:15:15

"working" is a generous descriptor when talking about ethereum

What spam attack? Spam attacks of 0 fee transactions that never get processed anyways? Fees make spam irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:45:34
Bch supporters say only miners should be running nodes anyways. At least that's what 2 of them spent hours telling me yesterday while getting upvoted.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:53:07
No not testnet. Real bitcoins. It's on YouTube, they Livestream d it

@_date: 2017-12-06 19:11:19
Blocksize disk space isn't the upper bound of requirements lol. If you were running a node on a coin that was actually used, you'd know that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:55:42
Well... you're wrong. So your point is invalid.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:30:28
OP and others, I think what you're missing is that nodes can open channels with each other.
You don't have to join and leave the Starbucks node for one coffee. You join the local bank node then use their node to hop some over for coffee at Starbucks node, then hop some over for Amazon at their node, etc etc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:28:31
It doesn't say that stop spreading lies
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:22:26
Did you try logging into gdax with your coinbase credentials? It should automatically make you an account at both that are linked to your personal information.

@_date: 2017-12-08 18:24:35
So that was 2 months before they had a live mainnet test using real bitcoins, and 1.5 months before they had all their multi client tests coming back 100% successful.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:41:43
The lightning network is still permission less and decentralized. It's just not on the blockchain with every transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:47:51
As many as I could
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:03:37
Are you using segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:04:10
Yes I might try that!
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:45:40
Full control of nodes without control of miners wouldn't delay anything? I thought you need block consensus from all nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:58:59
Taking tx off ram and batching in different ways may not be secure. Trying to cut corners on processing isn't a solved problem yet. It's experimental. Good think we ha EA shitcoins to test it.
If it works, maybe Bitcoin can try it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:53:32
Go away shill

Good thing lightning network is working on mainnet tests now

Only by a factor of 10 on scaling. No other coins can scale 100x without being even worse.

It's already working, we just need public facing software. Maybe 1-2 months.

So there's no solution and we should all pack it up and go home?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:01:11
Trezor has segwit, are you using it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:20:36
Blockchain.infk chooses literally the worst way possible to send your Bitcoin: a single nonsegwit output. If they combined your withdrawl with 9 other people and used segwit, it would cost less than $1.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:56:11
Thanks! Might migrate over there

I read somewhere they found a Bitcoin mine on the moon, and Korea is announcing it tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:12:48
Even without that, they have a huge base of merchants with square readers and registers. They can do everything off chain on their own books. No transaction fees or anything.

What makes you think bcash is better than ltc? They have same tx rate right now, and ltc has LN coming.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:37:14
Like how 99% of gold is sitting in vaults and personal stashes?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:45:43
If adoption becomes billions of users, by that time block size increases and other solutions will be more amenable. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:53:22
Also eth is only used to run all the shitcoins... It hasn't delivered on anything else of substance besides being a shitcoin engine. It may die too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:17:33
What wallet did you send to and from? Many have free increases from either end.
Also are you using segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:32:25
What coin is better?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:27:49
Lol 60 is so much less than 100....
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:23:53
Same. I like having roads and medicine, and that triggers a lot of people here who want to have infrastructure without paying taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:39:55
Yeah I bet coinbase or sauare would love a partnership, not to mention bitpay et Al already in the game

@_date: 2017-12-12 15:59:09
They are the same but only gdax initiated transfers are free. Coinbase shanks the noobs with fees even higher than the network. They balance out I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:32:56
It was on the front page 20 times yesterday lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:48:27
Yes biggest reason here. Decentralization and security comes first, scalability comes second.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:41:21
People are using it to move between exchanges to arbitrage, since other coins are getting slowed down by traffic. Demand driving price up.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:59:36
They never said that, there was a bug on their site they publicly corrected... They announced intent pending regulatory approval. Today regulatory approval and firm date was set.

How much does gigabit internet cost you? And 16gb+ ram?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:19:04
Probably the same. Don't need a lite Bitcoin if Bitcoin can do everything.

How will people exchange Bitcoin for Fiat on LN...?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:59:28

It sounds like you don't understand futures in general, you should read up on them independent of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:03:01
Maybe that's total assets including fractional reserve, and OP was liquidity? Not sure where his numbers from.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:48:33
Have you tried out the testnets?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:32:40
Are you being held hostage...? Why would they need 10g from you to leave?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:40:50
HDD is only storing the ledger post-fact. The smallest part of the nodes work.
Ram is needed to process the blocks. Current nodes need like half a gig.
Bandwidth is needed to communicate candidate blocks and bounce with other nodes. Current nodes need like 1tb/mo.
Did you jump on bcash without knowing how nodes work?
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:42:49
Mine was even worse, said they can't talk about future coin additions lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:40:58
Do you know how much science costs? Govt and industry together spend like 30bn/year in us, and industry only pulls 10bn in sales. They're profitable because the govt provides tax dollars to support university research. And prices can't triple, they're already unaffordable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:21:19
Stop lying, this is all wrong
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:31:27
Yeah when no one wants to use a coin it tends to be much cheaper
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:11:59
They finally led a buying charge
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:28:59
Network security and decentralization. And segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:24:07
You don't see the withdraw-only happening?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:22:34
Nice try but you missed the karma train
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:55:10
Yes you are wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:52:31
It has no problem only because the blocks are deserted and empty. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:47:53
I'd personally be ok with 2mb increase. But where do you draw the line? Once you do that, how do you keep people focused on LN instead of getting addicted to constant bandaid increases?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:18:17
I thought it was a good idea and did it... I'm asking for segwit and batched outputs. Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:06:52
Square can do off chain yo
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:35:10
$6 txs are clearing now, don't know why you're choosing to overpay so much
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:15:12
I sent a ticket yesterday asking for segwit, and j got an auto response that they can't talk about new coins being released... 
They are screwed
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:39:16
Litecoin has the same throughput as bcash, why didn't everyone switch to that?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:43:22
It's bullish that the price maintains during these sells. Also there's only so many people with 1000 coins to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:39:49
99% of the current problem can be solved if exchanges start adopting 100-batches of outputs and coordinating 10-batches of inputs, as well as adopting segwit. We already have these tools even without LN or other scaling methods.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:55:55
What do you think is the best way to remain decentralized while obtaining visa level tx speed?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:36:07
Yes but my monthly cap is the limiting factor. I know most US basic internet packages have similar caps too.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:02
Back up to 18
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:14:41
That's experimental. It's good to try it out on altcoin like bcash before risking actual value 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:32:56
Read again? 70% more efficient
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:20
Yes the shift card from coinbase. Not that I'd recommend coinbase right now :/
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:35:23
Can you cite a single private cancer research institute? And see how they compare to the billions of govt funding?
Even places like st Jude's still rely mostly on NIH
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:20:01
Yeah because no one used it. Keeping costs down in the face of activity hasn't been solved. Bcash would cripple itself if even 8mb blocks filled.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:12:02
LN is already using real bitcoins, check out the videos
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:58:12

Ever heard of K-pop lol

Yeah don't run nodes let Papa ver handle them for you
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:28:08
Either we dance or the bankers dance, but people are getting screwed either way. Might as well get screwed in a good long term direction.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:05:03
Miners compete though. Vitalik can change ethereum without other miners' consensus.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:07:14
Sometimes it fails because there's not enough nodes on the test network. Most test sites can also generate a peer node address alongside the payment address to manually open a channel directly to them. Yalls.org does that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:51
Oh man now they can have a store of value in one future, and crypto kitties and ICO shit in another. Tough decisions!
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:58:49
Maybe not 2mb. But 8mb does.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:12:25
Can you name an example?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:24:05
That's what you think a bank is? And that's what you think k LN is?
You could benefit from reading up on both.

They aren't card sharks...
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:16:36
The fee is usually based on capital mostly.
Like $1000 per year, plus 1% of assets
Totally fee based wouldnt make sense due to client diversity.
Of course now that VTI exists their jobs are mostly obsolete anyways, they still exist because people don't know there are free easy options.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:42:25
I'm against forcing miners but what's the harm? Especially if it's sat/byte and not just raw sat?

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:40:15
You can always run your own node and be your own bank. There are levels of trust and comfort for your own interests.

You still need a competitive sat/b (100-500 past couple days) but your tx will have far fewer bytes, making actual Satoshi cost lower.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:17:07
It's not competitive with other cryptos because other cryptos' chains have no value outside speculation. No one uses them off exchanges for any reason.
Also I don't know what kind of rich people currency broker you have access to but last week I heard a poor person on the train talking ablut sending $20 with Western Union for $5, just to get it across the city. My own banks have daily $1k limits, any more and I'd have to go through efforts with wire transfers or something.

Let me know when people are using bcash practically lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:04:11
No because of network effect. Even if they cash put every day, that increased volume means higher demand for Bitcoin against a scarce supply, and price goes up.

The really cool thing about square adoption is that merchants don't even need to know Bitcoin exists. When you go to a small business, frozen yogurt, farmers market, etc. They whip out their square reader or white tablet register. You could just click on Bitcoin instead of swiping your card. They could give the merchant cash and sell Bitcoin to next Bitcoin buyer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:36:18
It's been out 4 days. Bitcoins been out 10 years
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:08:37
No because you only spend one fee to enter. So total transactions needed are very few. Even exiting, fees will be low because the node will consolidate them during exit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:37:15
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:23:22
The fees exist because people are willing to pay $0.10 for a single byte of data on the Bitcoin ledger. No other coin has such an interest. Litecoin has the same throughout as Bitcoin cash, but neither have much demand. Bitcoin is trusted and valued, and the improvements on the horizon look more reliable than linear scaling solutions.

@_date: 2017-12-21 14:51:30
8-32mb nodes require good computers (or servers run by Alibaba in China, as with bch)
Bch has small hashrate so btc miners could tank it if they coordinated.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:59:56
Roth IRA can use gbtc.
As for the gbtc premium, that was the idea. But these prospectives say they can't guarantee parity with NAV. I think the impact will be more of the same as gbtc, except garnering 10x the assets. But I think they will be trading with 10%+ premiums too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:06:35

If you don't own Bitcoin and you want to start, you can buy lightning coins directly.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:00:29
That would require a hard fork away from legacy nodes. It would create a second coin with partial support.
This way people upgrade on their own terms instead of a central entity forcing them to.
But LN relies on segwit so using LN will require upgrading.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:44:12
So you think Bitcoin is insecure because windows is insecure?

Keep in mind cboe futures is really small. CME next week is when the real fun starts.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:10:11
If a true ETF gets released, demand will be huge. Gbtc is "only" 3 billion in btc. The ETF won't be able to buy more btc to keep up with demand, so they'll have a premium too.
At least that's what I think the first 6 months of EtFs will be like, and that's assuming the ETF bothers to buy more Bitcoin as it grows. They could stay the same and just become another gbtc clone.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:45:12
That's not true. If super cheap fees are available, users like me dick around with wallets sending stuff around to ourselves to experiment. That fills mempool up again and exchanges and purchases need to spend fees on top of us.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:48:51
I think single wallet txs are 30-40% smaller. So instead of 220bytes, maybe 150ish?

Ah thanks maybe I'll do that! I've had this conversation before and what's brought up is always just a post-block validating node or other variant. If I can actively participate in block confirmations that's perfect!
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:33:39
If you are sending more than once, you should immediately upgrade to segwit wallets. Instant fee reduction of like 35% for all future transactions, plus eligibility for LN when it arrives.

@_date: 2017-12-11 18:43:21
Transactions are limited because it keeps Bitcoin compact and decentralized. If nodes were bigger, only wealthy could afford computers to run them
LN let's more transactions process without increasing requirements for node computers.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:15:43
gigabit internet isn't available most places. My major US city internet caps me at 250gb/mo, o can't even run a 1mb block node!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:45:34
The channels send and interact with each other. Assuming you don't keep balances on other nodes, it would look like you spending all your money at Starbucks, then Starbucks spending money on Amazon on your behalf for your product. Then, whenever Starbucks closes their node they'd settle up your balance.
Another cool idea is rotating nodes. If the Starbucks runs 3 nodes, they can bounce your balance around. You never have  to open/close until you want to. If the node holding your wallet needs to cash out, you can send it to another node to stay up.

It is truly the whitepapers vision, now on vhs and dvd
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:21:07
That's how much it costs for stupid wallets that don't use segwit or batching... If you use a better provider you don't get these problems.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:51:57
Finding and installing a wallet is as simple as installing an app on your phone. Channel providers will be easy to find through apps, and their decentralized nature means you can hook up to one anywhere.  I'm planning on running one myself.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:38:38
I just sent a request.

How much are they getting paid to say that lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:36:31
But in the real world we see the exact opposite of your argument. Taxes make people reinvest over hoarding, and low taxes result in hoarding... This has been a consistent trend for a hundred years.

Super cheap transactions, better interfaces, networked interactions with other stores and banks
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:34:59
Segwit with backwards compatibility is a soft fork.
Forcing all nodes to upgrade with something similar to segwit would be a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:26:40
Segwit isn't a moral decision it's a financial one lol. Lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:29:58
It sounds like you don't know what those things are. I'd recommend reading the sidebar and other resources before putting your coins at risk. Transfer mistake are permanent!
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:20:40
Segwit changes the way transactions are assembled and added to the blockchain, making it about 70% more efficient.
To use segwit only requires updating wallets to segwit addresses. There are exchanges that use segwit like bitstamp, I'm supporting them until others catch up.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:10:28
That's the cool thing about Bitcoin, even if it was created with malicious intent it remains fully decentralized. Unless someone can crack sha256 even the creators can't do a thing.

You have to go into settings and change fee slider settings
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:05:54
That's the cool thing. Bitcoins technology is the only one working. It's scalability is the only issue. Unlike eth and iota, it doesn't have bugs or wallet issues, there's no Centralization or ruling party that can issue more coins. Scalability can be fixed, but proving everything else is perfect is awesome.

But they aren't reinvesting it at all, let alone efficiently. It's hiding offshore. Why?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:09:47
That's why it's so slow and expensive. Coinbase uses methods of transferring coins that make it 20x more expensive than it should. I'd recommend switching to bitstamp exchange since they will use segwit and batched outputs to reduce your fees to under $1
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:30:25
Those are bare minimums for Bitcoin node. Full bcash node can't run in that little.

Bitstamp has segwit and batching. They're one of the only places where you can withdraw Bitcoin for under a dollar. Coinbase on the other hand charges like 30 because they suck at optimization.

Every Friday or end of month it's either "people are buying worth their paycheck" or "people are cashing out to go shopping". One of them is usually right lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:50:02
Basically yes.
But what's better is you don't have to rely on their channel to "do" it, it's all done trustless through the cryptography. As long as point A and point B are both on the world wide web of lightning nodes, your transaction can find a way there.
Also the node you join doesn't even need to be a bank node. You could use your local Starbucks' node as your gateway to worldwide commerce lol
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:55:31
Right now I can't run a 1mb node from my metropolitan US city. The bandwidth needed is too much, I'd have to pay $40/mo to upgrade for it. Block size increases would kick even more off the network and make it centralized. 
2mb might be an option in a couple years, but world internet infrastructure is still too unevenly distributed for that now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:59:32
Bitcoin nodes now need 500mb-1gb ram and 1tb/mo bandwidth. 8mb nodes would therefore need 4-8gb ram and 8tb bandwidth, both of which are high end on consumer spectrum. You'd need to buy a $100/mo internet connection and $500 computer just to dedicate to bcash nodes at capacity.
And then what happens if 32mb nodes...

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:49:22
Segwit makes transactions much cheaper. Also exchanges that batch your transaction with other customers can save you up to 95% on fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:52:06
Right now I'd go with bitpay for simplicity. Once LN is out, open a node and accept payments on that.
Also because Bitcoin is so popular now, fees are high until exchanges get their shit together and process their transactions more efficiently (or LN comes out). If you're selling products under $100, Bitcoin isnt a terribly attractive option until fees stabilize again.

@_date: 2017-12-06 18:36:32
Right because there are no transactions filling blocks lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:15:31
Bitcoin is already 2mb thanks to segwit. If it were 8mb full blocks like bch, raspberry pies would not have enough ram or processing power to keep up, and many more home internet's would be knocked off as well. 
A 4x increase to bch levels would require people to dedicate an old but still decent laptop, or run the node on their main computer, and have top tier internet lines.
32mb (next stop for bch) would require top of the line servers and computers, which would limit them to miners and rich people.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:01:13

No they cannot legally coordinate their moves, or even manipulate futures and Bitcoin intentionally on their own. That's called market fixing, and it's illegal. That's the point of the SEc and cftc approving the futures brokers.

Because coinbase chooses to not use segwit and not batch your transaction with other users' withdrawls. If they did those, it would be less than $1 instantly.

I take it off coinbase so I own it. If you trust coinbase (who is fdic insured and partnered with bbva bank) nothing wrong with that, but they're not your bitcoins, you have an IOU for them.

Something not created? Are you aware LN has been used to send real bitcoins across world already? All that's missing is customer-facing software.
Short term linear solutions are addictive. Look at bcash, ready to jump to terabyte nodes. Even 8mb nodes would make it so that only Roger and Jihan are running them. Bcash supporters have now convinced themselves that normal users shouldn't be running nose, and leaving them to Roger and Jihan s megaservers.
A 2mb block size may not be the end of the world, but it opens up a can of worms. Where do we draw the line?

Ok so now you're wrong because you are calling a"millibitcoin" a "millibit". It's not a millibit. Milli means 1/1000th so a millibit would be 1/10 of a Satoshi, or 1/1000th of a bit.

The tether company claims to back tether. Their claim is currently undergoing an independent audit. And no one has ever been denied withdrawing USD back from usdt.
There's no evidence that their claim is bad. And the stupid thing is, the argument of printing twrhers for fractional reserve is just adding a complicated and unnecessary step. All exchanges could be doing that without Tethers already even easier than making a fake currency.

IMO it's safe but not as independent. You're relying on a bank-like institution instead of managing security yourself.
If you don't know what you're doing and try to manage it yourself, you could end up with lost or stolen bitcoins. Until you're ready for that step, an exchange is a good option. It's like a bank, you don't own the money, just a promise the bank will give you the money if requested. But it's more secure than you as an unexperienced individual.

From my small understanding:
Bitmain makes ASICs for mining, and they discovered a way to cheat at the algorithm called asic boost. Makes their asics 30% faster.
When Bitcoin upgraded with segwit, they discovered asic boost and also patched in a thing to prevent asic boost from being used anymore. I don't think it's segwit directly stopping it, just two upgrades that were done together.
Bitcoin cash miners are still using the asic boost cheat while they try to make their centralized coin (led by Bitmain and it's supporters) overtake Bitcoin.

Ethers infrastructure is so lousy right now that there are constantly bugs and hacks that lose people money, require roll backs, or necessitate contentious hard forks. If ether had it's shit together it'd be running the world. But it is sloppy and unsafe.
Also I believe most of the current market forces driving it are ICOs being run on ether. few merchants take ether. If ICOs lose ground to Bitcoin forks, ether could die with them.
Btc = secure + popular
Eth = popular + cheap
Bch = secure + cheap
Cheap is the easiest problem to fix, thanks to second layer solutions.

It's closer to evidence than anything you've presented. But to confirm conspiracy and not just bad management 2 things need to happen
1 they can't roll back hack tx
2 the Tethers have to get released into the wild and used to buy btc before they are frozen
If those things don't happen it's actually approaching evidence of fraud, unlike anything you've brought up. But if the Tethers are saved, it's just evidence of more stupidity on their part 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:09:02
I think the only way they could do that is if they got all ISPs to block traffic on the Bitcoin node port (8333 I think) and also universally banned (and enforced bans) on consumer vpns.

Barrier to entry is a good point.
As for scamming, regulations are about making something easy more difficult on top of basic laws. 
 Scamming Bitcoin would be easy if you had an ATM that retained paper wallet private keys, or occasionally failed to payout properly. If anyone could set up an ATM and obscure their identity they could get away with a lot before it was taken down. 
Is it possible to  have easy/cheap access but rigorously vetted regulations and credentials for the people who control ATMs?

Bch block are low and manageable because no one uses it.
If it started filling even 2-4mb blocks consistently, the ram/processing power of nodes would be too much for a raspberry pi to handle, and the bandwidth would exceed most US home cable data limits. Only people with expensive internet plans and decent computers to spare could run nodes.

The only way you could even slow down Bitcoin would be to block all traffic on node port, and enforce bans on vpns.

US advertises flat rates with small print data caps. Usually those are 1tb a month, which is what 1mb nodes use. 
If bch/btc flipped and bch was actually used, bch nodes would be 2mb now. New pies would probably start sputtering even at that point.and current pies would be useless by 4mb. Might not be ready for that for years. I don't think a lot of research is going into super cheap processors.
Most Americans don't have old laptops lying around that are also still functional and have decent processing and ram. Because if those still worked well enough for a big block node, then they'd still be using it as their primary laptop.

I don't think I claimed that, you've just been arguing against that. LN will be thousands. Rootstock is hundreds next month, which is more than enough for current growth.
I found their live test feed in 10 seconds. Of you can't find it, you don't want to. That means if I link you to it you'll just move the goalpost more as to why it's fake or not applicable to the real world without any factual basis behind your reasoning.

From my understanding replay protection is for a symmetrical wallet. If you can take a freshly mined shitcoin and add it into a wallet, the wallet now has X Bitcoin and X+1 shitcoin. Then you transfer x+1 to a new wallet, and only the shitcoins can transfer since the Bitcoin request is invalid. So now you have the bitcoins alone and shitcoins alone.

Bitcoin volume and liquidity is much less. If true, strategic drips of 10million tethers could in theory pump up the price compared to the normal hourly trading of 100mill. And it creates a sudden imbalance of buy/sell orders.

There are trillions of private dollars right now that could feed, cloth, house, and employ every poor person on Earth. But the owners of those dollars "choose" not to.

I think gold futures are very different because the gold market is already established and saturated. Everyone who wants to trade their money for gold has had that opportunity for hundreds of years. Bitcoin is still emerging and finding it's stable market value and price. I think futures could manipulate it at that level like gold, but right now there are too many buyers.

I think biggest throttle now isn't the computer but bandwidth. A 1mb block node now uses 1tb data per month, which is also the limit of many US cable services (some are even lower like 250gb/mo!).

Exchanges don't need tether to do fractional reserve. They just sell more Bitcoin and USD reserves to holding accounts than they have. As long as everyone isn't withdrawing at the same time, no problem.

Except no one uses millibit in that way outside the wiki page. We use mbtc or millibitcoin.
Bit is getting close to being a standard unit on it's own, and derived units that end in bit would need to relate to it, not to the original Bitcoin.
You can't use millibit as a Bitcoin derivative, and bit as it's own unit, at the same time since they have the same base name and different references.
It would be like having a special "quarter" that is slang for $25. How much does this cost? Three dollars and a quarter? What quarter?

From my understanding, in order for a record to get into the block chain, it needs to be mathematically valid (which no one has been able to spoof) and then accepted by the majority of nodes which check it. Then it gets mined and added to block. Might be off on some of this

Why would tether correlate to btc price though? If tether was fake then the people currently holding those 600m of tether they bought by selling btc would be left with nothing. No one holding btc would be directly hurt. Tether holders would get pissed at the tether bank, but it's a USD fraud that would have been committed.
When tether is issued, even if bitfinex is buying it themselves to bump price, they are trading those btc for tethers. Someone is accepting those tethers to hold.
The worst that can happen is the 600m USD tether owners think they have disappears. That's gone, but no Bitcoin. 
So if you don't trust them, don't buy tethers. That's what I do.

As to ram
512mb is a must right now. So current 1gb pies are good for 2mb blocks (and segwit). If blocks go past 2 or 3 mb, ram will start saturating.
So if bch grows faster than pies are advanced, then ram is a problem. If you plan on bch remaining unused for another 3 years, no problem.

Isn't the only way they can use a fradulent nonbacked tether, to buy Bitcoin for it? Which means there were $600M of Bitcoin ppl were willing to sell for tether. On the Fiat belief that tether was backed by usd.
Honestly even if they are fake, what they're doing would be inflating USD supply with fake US dollars. The fed does that every day and it doesn't stop Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:43:38
Do you expect them to give you access to inside knowledge of their financial assets? We are just lowly hodlers. I bet the institutions buying 20m tether per go are comfortable with the backing. But maybe there are assets they don't want publically known. Maybe China and Hong Kong drama, or Russia and us drama, who knows. But why does everyone expect they'd release these intimate details just because we asked?
I don't trust them so I don't use them. I hold my keys so my coins are safe. Banking fraud is what Bitcoin is designed to avoid, and it's easy to do.

I agree with your spending argument but investment is another story
Right now people invest so their money grows instead of shrinks. If their money grew anyways theyd have to be convinced an investment will outpace natural Bitcoin growth, which is much harder. Some people say that will make investing more traditional unlike the speculative derivatives market that rules today, but some people think it will just promote hoarding.

I don't think this is likely because CME is THE futures market. The regulatory board they are working with basically exists to regulate them alone. They aren't like ledgerX or some start up trying to persuade the SEC.
I think that their cautious and soft announcements have been vetted for legalese and carry much more weight than suggested. "Might release 2nd week of December" means this is a sure thing and date should be pretty certain too.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:15:00
It keeps fees low for a month. Then the 2mb blocksize is saturated with their low fee spam again.
As blocksize increases, they are able to gain node dominance as the HDD, ram, and bandwidth requirements surpass normal users capacity. Then they can control nodes AND mining, and then they own Bitcoin.

Most "military" spending isn't actually on wars and bombs. The military industrial complex is used to do industry for the government on things people don't want to pay for. Like research and development.
For example, I conduct prostate cancer research currently funded by a DoD grant, independent of the proper NIH funding. I get paid directly from "military" tax dollars and I'm a civilian doing nothing close to military.

Right that's just the definition of blocksize. I wouldn't call an extra 3 txs per 10 minutes a significant scaling gain.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:14:57
I was under the impression that while a new node is being formed, txs and candidate blocks are swaing around the full nodes. That's why their bandwidth is 1tb/month. Then when the block is mined they confirm it and start propogating the new node around to reach consensus.
This small node thing would just jump in after all this is done and add the consensus node to it's ledger. 
If this small node was good enough, what's the point of all these 1tb/mo nodes?

@_date: 2017-11-08 14:35:56
You mentioned it stops bleeding and kills MRSA. If your data shows that in cell culture and a couple mice, you don't need more. If pharma companies are hesitating and not even offering some partnership, then you have nothing solid. They are like sharks, if there was food nearby they would go crazy for it. People with promising but poorly developed ideas are constantly getting bought out for development, that's how early stage research goes nowadays. 
Besides, the company needs to repeat your findings to make sure they are real anyways, they won't just pick up where you left off. They don't need you to do more work if they think it's a real and good idea.
Like I said, this is a billion dollar idea. Those are rare nowadays, most new drugs have small markets. If a company thought it had a 1% chance of working, they'd give you millions and let you walk away. If expert scientists have seen your idea and walked away from that chance, it probably means they don't believe it works like you think.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:44:59

Wow that's a long way back you have to dig to find a non government influence on the internet lol.
Brief glance at Wikipedia, Bell was an academic at BU, who got into research and sound due to academics in the field stimulating his interest and bouncing ideas off them. Most of his early work was in academia, until he had enough ideas to quit academia and sell his ideas to fund private research.
That's how research is now, even for me. I'm in academia, networking and learning, and if I find something big, I go to a business so I can be rich instead of letting the government take part in what it has fostered inside me all these years.

They operate differently than block chain, and I'm not convinced their consensus mechanism is robust and reliable. It's still new though so maybe it can prove itself.

I think one way of increasing spending would be to start out offering discounts. If you have a business offer 5% discount for Bitcoin payments. Not a big problem for HODLing, it'll incentivize people to use their btc over credit card when they might otherwise choose credit for convenience, and it'll get newbies interested in asking "what's this Bitcoin and how can I save that 5%?"
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:33:43
Deflationary Bitcoin (once volatiliy levels off) makes more sense than a checking account, since it could keep organically growing instead of suffering from inflation. If it's universally accepted, you won't need a bank account and could use Bitcoin instead.

This is a "light" wallet. It is kind of it's own node but not a full node.
