The last product I *tried* to purchase was a Spotify code from some clown over on who took the money and then fucked off. He posts there and deletes old posts and comments, and eventually the mods over there banned me from commenting below his posts that he's a fraudster. He's moved on to a new account but the onion address he links - iybwz5aq2yoig7q6.onion - never changes.
The last thing I *successfully* bought with bitcoin was some vape weed. Probably less than a week from purchase to arrival at my door.

It's homeopathic phone use. The lower the charge, the more powerful it is.

We call that "lower torso extraction"

This was exactly what I thought in my head when I saw the subject line. Don't be so sensitive, downvoters!

Unless it's changed since about 5 years ago, a parent has to have served *and has to have an account*. They can just set up one for no cost and that's enough to get you in the door, but when we got validated for this purpose by identifying my wife's father (my account was from the time when they had open enrollment) they made him do the minimal signup.

Inflation historically averages 3.5%, so if you assume that over a long horizon the market will increase at 11% and inflation at 3.5% then you're staying well ahead. Obviously averages are just that and past performance is not proof of future actions, etc.

[Civil forfeiture requires you be notified when they take something of yours.]( 
I personally would shrug off $23 but for the $200 mentions I'd probably contest it as not drug related, at least to the tune of sending a notice. If they're sending you a notice they've got your name; seems unlikely their actions will be any different just because you dispute it.

And I guess we can debate whether [almost twenty thousand doses]( qualifies as "low" as well.

78 comments and not one "in yo mama" yet? I am disappoint.

Just saying that their number of "customers" includes people at the free level. Without knowing what percentage converts to paying membership (and how long they then keep their paid accounts active) we don't really know how big a usage base this would really mean for Bitcoin.

I thought that was Staples.

Except there's a free level, so 15M leeches and 69 people who actually pay doesn't mean much for bitcoin usage.
