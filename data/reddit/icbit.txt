I wonder, does it apply to derivatives which involve US dollars, or does CFTC really target inverse bitcoin futures traders?

We ( plan to launch this functionality pretty soon, actively testing it now.
If you like, you can create an account and once it's live we'll send out an email announcement.

I read that blockchain.info wallet supports this kind of "private key". I have no experience of using that service myself (I never trust any third party with bitcoins), but I think you could give it a try in an attempt to recover your coins,

Malleability and double spending have absolutely nothing to do with that. Double spend means that the actual second spend will get ignored and that's it.
Now, as for coins. Every transaction sends a certain amount of bitcoins to the target address, and some amount to one of your addresses in the wallet, which is called "a change".
I'm not familiar with Multibit HD however I would export its wallet to some other service (to Bitcoin Core, or to Blockchain.info for example) and let it recover all the bitcoins you may have there. Then, I would send them to a brand new address created by a wallet software of your choice.

icbit supports both HTTP and HTTPS, with preferring SSL when users's browser supports it.
Alas bluplr is too fast in his conclusions and could not even see that when he types  it actually goes to  and uses that for login/etc.

Proposals are accepted! In fact, we did not specify any rebates now because there is enough to be made with just arbitraging between two markets, however, liquidity rebates may be considered.
