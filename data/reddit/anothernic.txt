Take your $1,000 to every bank you can get pennies at. 
Melt the pennies.
Sell the meltweight for more than your $1,000.
Repeat. 
BOOM. SUEPR RIHC.

Hell of a story man, appreciate you sharing it. 


Hit the nail on the head there; Bitmain in and of itself has done enough shady garbage that it isn't even worth rehashing here, but man, wish I'd had a better sense of it going in. Nobody's fault but my own research, there. 
Funny you mention Awesome Miner; already use it. I haven't fooled much with algo switch due to some... paranoia about my own ability to track T.A. (it's an ever improving art for me), but love it for monitoring/ease of use.

Citation needed. Why would the Iranians attach mines, that the crew of the ships said were actually projectiles not mines, to Japanese oil tankers...while the Prime Minister Abe of Japan was meeting with the Iranian administration?
Newsflash: They wouldn't. It's kind of funny that "Israeli intelligence" immediately warned the US of a pending Iranian attack... minutes before the attack was broadcast on the news. Remember the Maine? The Gulf of Tonkin? 


Not the first time the US has lost drones over Iranian airspace. The last time they managed to jam C&amp;C for the drone, the Iranians then sold the drone to China.

It's hugely interesting to me, a guy that got in during Oct/Nov '17 to read posts arguing about price from that time in 2016. Zooming out to the daily can definitely bring some perspective.

Ignorance in a lot of cases, and fear of learning TA well enough to do what you have. I've been half-assedly working at better understanding charts and movement for the past year, and started mining in April of '18 (yay way too late, hopefully I ROI this century). 
For perspective: I set my stop loss way too high for the last dip before this recent climb, and managed to lose 3% in the last 2 days even. 
This though I hadn't understood S-L well enough to dodge the November crash. I know a little better **now** but that doesn't bring my money back, and becomes a more expensive lesson than say... buying a good book on T.A.

Such a huge surprise that while in **captivity for 4 years** he might happen to favor the candidate which had spoken favorably of him previously and appeared might be less likely to send him to the gallows? M U C H A S U R P R I S E 


Strawman, I have not once claimed he was "impartial" just that he isn't definitively aligned with either party. Since taking asylum against charges that resemble something from the CIA's playbook on discrediting adversaries, he has had a marked shift toward Trump.
If you were locked up for 4 years, would you start looking for allies of opportunity that might permit you freedom, again?

No doubt, but there wasn't much traction initially at the time of the WP and bureaucracies like governments are notoriously slow (typically) to respond to bleeding edge new tech. 
I hope he's on a beach somewhere sipping his beverage of choice enjoying the notoriety of anonymous celebrity, but who knows?

Absence of evidence isn't evidence. Without knowing who SN really is, for all we know the state has assassinated him, or disappeared him, or hasn't ever figured out who he is.

Freedom of speech has a lot to do with BTC. The exchange of information, including the bits which represent digital currency, is a modern issue of government versus individual liberty.


Seems like a guy who's a right-wing ideologue wouldn't be publishing thousands of diplomatic cables harmful to both aisles of the US imperialist warmachine? Or did I miss the GOP logo on Collateral Murder?

Multiple layers here but I agree with more than I disagree. I don't have allegiance or warm fuzzy feelings about him like I did in the early 2000s after reading cypherpunks. However, I also am not going to decry a guy trying to get free by any means necessary, including colluding with Russians. 
Did his actions hurt our nation's sovereignty? Sure, but no more than Wassermanschultz rigging the DNC primary for an unpopular candidate, or our state department paying for a coup in Ukraine.

You're making a lot of assumptions about state actors and avoiding surveillance. Starting up the first bitcoin traffic is likely something that could be analyzed by Five Eyes nations.

That doesn't make the process any more... democratic. Providing questions ahead of time to one candidate but not others isn't an even playing field either, but fuck the lot of wall st criminals for all I care.

Keep smoking what you're smoking, the democrats "high road" response has seen SCOTUS stacked for decades to come by illegally not hearing the Merrick nomination. It also put forth an unpopular cold-war relic that wasn't electable after the most undemocratic primary process possible, that predictably lost. 
Both parties are parties of Wall St. which is a much bigger problem than any individual corruption, but keep riding that "the Russians, watergate 2.0!" fever.

The Democratic Socialists of America? The Communist Party USA? Antifa Supersoldiers United? The League of Extraordinary Gentleman? 
You're a fool if you think the Democratic party is Left. Sure, it's left of the right-wing GOP, but it's still firmly in the same quadrant on the political compass. It's pro-war, pro-surveillance, pro-corporate, etc.

Pro-capitalism and plutocracy is left-wing, huh? That's a new new interesting redefinition of what wing means what, but I guess newspeak is real.

Mistaking neoliberalism for "Left" means you're going to have a bad time. Next you'll be telling me libertarian means minarchist feudalism...oh wait.
