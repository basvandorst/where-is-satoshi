Curious if anyone here has taken the time to read this bill?  It's almost as good as a Stephen King horror novel.  I even noticed a meet-up about it. Yeah, don't expect to hear about any of this on the news, unless it comes under a self-aggrandizing partisan lede like "Look what we schlubs did! We wrote a bill!".
This bill is just a bunch of amendments of older laws, so you have to meticulously cross reference various other laws. Most are self explanatory, but not really when it comes to the laws we live under.  
I strongly suggest that any response to your representative about this pending legislation should be specific.  I read it and I can attest, if you call up your reps and say "hey! take bitcoin and cryptos out of that bill", you will sound like an uninformed citizen-- Or in their words, just another idiot plebe. It would be like asking the executioner to not execute you.
There are a few things we can make a stink about, which I think will catch them off guard.  I think this bill reveals a lot about the craziness going on lately (i.e. deep state, bittrex, pedo, blah blah blah).  In general, it's a pretty fucked up bill, aiming at putting anyone and everyone in prison. A clusterfuck when the government defaults, credit ceases, and the shtf.
Here's my notes on this bill, which I'm calling "Hell in a Nutshell";
The bill mostly amends existing laws to accommodate cryptocurrency transactions or what they refer to as transmissions. Crypto transactions/transmissions, moving cryptocoins from one place to another, practice different protocols than the SWIFT system in place. Existing law is based on swift and it needs amending.  We can all agree on that, right?
(The fact that congress is enacting these laws tells me Blockchain is here to stay, and will run parallel or over the Swift system. Or maybe this is just a temporary fix due to those numbskulls not reporting their gains. Yeah, I'm talking to you Mr. $200M Ethereum Trader.)    
  
Who was at the hearing... 
-DOJ (constitutional department)
-DHS  (not so constitutional department) 
-Treasury Dept. (FIAT money printer or what I call a "SWIFT miner")
-Hudson Institute (lobbyist)
-Defense of Democracies (lobbyist)
-IBI Consultants (deep state contractor, terrorism &amp; enforcement)
-Coinbase ( Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, Board of Directors  i.e  the poor bastard)
Who was NOT at the hearing...
-Bittrex  (and who can blame them?  this senate committee single-handedly ruined their customer base.) 
(The names on these panels are important to mention, because only one of them was susceptible to going to prison under this legislation-- Ms. Rodriguez from Coinbase.  In fact, Ms. Rodriguez was attending on behalf of all Coinbase employees and us, who all could be subscribed to prison sentences based on this legislation. This bill does not mess around.  Unlike a bank, where only the bank executives involved in crime would go to jail, if any 'exchange' takes part in smuggling or laundering, etc, even unwittingly, the EXECS &amp; EMPLOYEES of that exchange could go to prison.  Even the employees!!!!! ) 
THIS IS MOST LIKELY THE REASON "BITTREX" RECENTLY ENACTED A VERY STRICT VERIFICATION PROCESS!!!  THEY SAID IT IN THEIR UPDATES AND I NOW BELIEVE THEM--- ITS THE STUPID LAWMAKERS FORCING THEM TO COMPLY.
The bill changes a few things in the law that is listed below... All are quite severe, and very oppressive.
- It raises jail time from 5 years to 10 years.
- The law still applies to assets over $10k in value.  That's only 1 btc guys!?!?!?!  So I guess inflation is a only one-way street, huh? This should be raised to $25k-$50k at least. For chrissakes you cannot even go on vacation with less than $10k in your pocket nowadays!!!  This is what you fight for when calling in!!!)
- They added fines. Before you just went to jail. This bill sends you to jail and fines you, making it harder to afford a defense attorney and possibly and probably bankrupting you.  When calling, demand a ceiling on these fines, as it appears the fines can be of any value, and determined by who-- A bureaucrat?.
- Several changes employ the "Obamacare scam" of mincing words..."penalty vs. tax".... This bill changes a few very important words in the existing laws, which to me are highly suspect.   Changes as follows; "unlicensed" to "illegal"... "transmitting" changed to "services" ....  
- This bill literally makes sha-256 illegal. Let me repeat that... one basis of the blockchain technology, anonymity, is being deemed illegal under the "Concealment Clause".  If you intend or do not intend to keep yourself unknown in a transmission, it is a violation of this law. Meaning, you have to have your name attached to any and all transactions/transmissions, or what they're now calling "services".  This makes all exchanges without verification illegal. It makes wallets without verification illegal. Good luck with that one.  And don't forget, even the employees go to jail.  Maybe get your coins off blockchain.info or myetherwallet asap. Just to be safe.  I've moved most of my crypto to paper and coinbase.
- Ceases all funds and bank accounts upon your arrest.  Remember that defense attorney you wanted to call, not this time sucka. Your bank account and credit cards are ceased upon your arrest. Not indictment or conviction.  Upon your arrest.  Like I said, this bill does not mess around. 
- Ties together money laundering with tax evasion. This is a tricky one, so think this one through guys.  IF you are caught 'smuggling' 1 btc that you already paid taxes on, BUT you have 3 btc at home that you haven't.... Well, all btc is the same to them. There's a funny loop hole in there.  It does not state whether they can charge you with evasion even after you paid taxes on the gains just for spite, but this one does have that loop hole where you can get into trouble for doing nothing wrong.
- Counterfeiting. There's some word changes to counterfeiting laws that I didn't waste time researching, but it appears to be making a run at bitcoin mining under the auspice of "counterfeiting currency".  Just got that vibe, otherwise why update it?  Just use Genesis-Mining, I say. They're mining in Iceland with fuck you lawyers in Hong Kong.  They don't give a fuck what this senate panel has to say.
-Sec 13 ties cryptocurrencies to money orders, basically introducing them as the same thing in terms of the law.  So sending bitcoin will be viewed no differently than sending money via wire or western union. 
-"Prepaid Access Devices"  -  They introduce another Obamacare Scam term; "prepaid access device", which is another way of saying a hard or soft wallet.  A trezor, exodus, address, and the private key.  All of those things are what is now called a "prepaid access device".  Your wallets, guys.  It looks to me they're coming for the wallets. There's a lot of verbiage over prepaid access devices, including ways to detect-find them on your person.
-The GAO report. The most ominous. Basically requires the Comptroller General of the US to submit a progress report to congress 18mos after the law is enacted. But it states specific targets for study which portends to me mass arrests and complete disruption of the industry.  
It states:  
"Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report on— (1) the impact the amendments made by subsection (a) have had on law enforcement, the prepaid access industry, and consumers; and (2) the implementation and enforcement of the final rule entitled “Bank Secrecy Act Regulations—Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Prepaid Access” (76 Fed. Reg. 45403 (July 19, 2011)) by the Department of the Treasury."
Every law enforcement agency is being tied into this new law.
If you withhold information from an exchange or financial institution, holds a penalty of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $1million. 
The deep state is literally waived from obeying this law, meaning if you are in law enforcement or a deep state agency, this law does not apply to you.  Maybe I'm green on "rules of construction", but oh boy does that seem fair?
It states:
" Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed to apply to the authorized law enforcement, protective, or intelligence activities of the United States or of an intelligence agency of the United States."
(This bill tells us so much about who our US government is and what they really think of the middle class, the mainstay of the Cryptocurrency world.  When you look at this bill on top of that new shady tax bill, one could easily conclude our government representatives want us dead.  This new bill will make it almost impossible for anyone to reform their lives after being ruled "guilty" for such a crime.  It's not 5 years now, it's 10 years. Rapists get less time. And yeah, Congress will take your life savings-thank you very much... All for not reporting that 1-BTC in a trezor on the way to Paris for your honeymoon!!!! ) 
Before any of you say "Well, I'm not a criminal, so what do I care?"... If you just forget you had that 1 btc on you, then you now have to spend all your assets from a jail cell in proving that you are not a criminal. In the US, citizens are guilty until proven innocent... Unless you have swamp privilege, of course.
My conclusion is based on reading this law and on recent policy chaos among exchanges.  I think the law is very dangerous.  It appears written by lawmakers who are either malevolent or not knowledgeable of the technology they are curtailing, due to the wide dragnet it's casting over the industry.  Everyone, and I mean everyone will be skewered before they're allowed to pass into the new regulated system.  For now, I feel somewhat safe at coinbase since they were represented here.  Hackers are no longer the biggest threat in the room it seems.
