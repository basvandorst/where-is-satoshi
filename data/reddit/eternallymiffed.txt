How does this differ from namecoin?

That's the whole selling point. And you view this is a negative?

It's an [interesting, if old idea.](

A very retarded type of communist too. There's nothing inherently incompatible between public ledgers of the type of crypto we use now and communism.
In an alternative reality the USSR would be using a centralised form of crypto currency. Wich would be 90% the same as current implementations with the added modification that the central ruling commitee has unrestrained power to control and warp the network. 
That is, it would defeat the purpose of decentralization but they would still use cryptos for all their other benefits. Chief among them would be full transparency so private interest can't steal from the "collective".

What he hopes and what tends to happen are two different things. In any case. The producers of the CP will become known eventually as the kids grow up. Further no person does their OPSEC 100% flawlessly. I still think crypto-assasinations are a key way to solve "philosophically allowed but socially unthinkable actions".

Please do. Hard personal grudges poured onto a page are always entertaining to read. For everyone involved.

In a truly free market producers/distributors/consumers of child porn would have open bounties for their heads placed on them. Completely anonymously funded, processed and paid out hitlists. 
So the problem of child porn will be solved, through violence.

Fuck all of those people. "I didn't know" is never an excuse. I took the time to educate myself, in this day and age is inconceivable how anyone can continue to float along without such basic knowledge.

They can change the name all they like, it's still google.

In a way I'm glad the kind of bucket-of-crabs-people like them are not on "my side" of the political divide. At least not quite as many and  not quite with so much power as they are in most "social justice" communities online.

Lets assume humanity is an inherently corrupt and evil force. Then why wouldn't you join the side of evil? I mean, if you were born an URUKHAI you wouldn't suddenly decide to go Lawful-good right? Work with what you have. 
If I had your beliefs I'd go for maximum evil instead of anti-natalist fatalism.

There's nothing wrong with fearing that which should be feared. 


It's a fair assumption. If you removed your ideological blinders for a minute you would see why it applies.

Oh yeah. That's the real problem, isn't it. It's just because they are different.
And if these scared pussy right wingers grow a pear and decide to do something about their mortal existential fear what are you going to say then? Are you going to cheer them on?

When you import the third world at the rate they are right now and when your societal mechanisms of control are unable to cope you will become the third world.
