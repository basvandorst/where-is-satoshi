Wait, really? Thats weird. With Coinbase, when you buy BTC, it purchases it at the price you executed the bank transfer, not when the funds become available.

I literally stopped reading at


if you think that past performance doesnt help better predict the longterm behavior of financial assets, equities, and products - AND you also believe the same historic metrics have zero bearing on future performance of similar products, you're grossly misinformed on the subject matter lol. I regularly perform financial modeling, and its a field that is based on using metrics from the past. I mean for fucks sake - ANY forecasting model or predictive analytics engine is using past performance as measurable variables. 
youre delusional

But it's a damn good indicator. Everyone stop acting like past results are useless when it comes to predicting upcoming events. It doesn't prove anything, but it helps shape better and more thoughtful conclusions
