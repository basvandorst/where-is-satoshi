THERE IS NO RISK OTHER THAN THEM KNOWING YOUR TRANSACTIONS!!
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:51:01
I've already told you several times that the ONLY RISK IS KNOWING YOUR TRANSACTIONS.  If you don't care about that then go for it. 
So, here's the distinction.  If you don't care about someone possibly knowing your transactions and aren't doing anything illegal, run SPV.  If you want to break the law or contribute to bitcoins decentralization, run a full node.  
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:16:20
I wouldn't say all merchants.  The larger ones yes.  Smaller merchants should be able to rely on trusted sources.  
SPV doesn't defeat the purpose of bitcoin at all.  If you think you can grow bitcoin without thin clients, you're wrong.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:26:00


Yes, the majority of people should be running an SPV wallet.  


Still, a portion of it is devoted to SPV as it should be.  
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:07:50


I'm asking you to back up your claim.   Don't make an assertion if you can't back up your claim.  This is a cop out.    


WOAH!  There's a helluva claim.  You going to back up that one or are you just going to resort to ad hominem by refusing to "hold my hand"? 
Let me know when you're ready to send me 21 million BTC.  I'll give you an address to send it to.  
@_date: 2016-07-19 20:11:02
That is incorrect.  
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:41:05
Why would I care if the merchant used a service provider that ran a full node?  The question is do I trust his service provider.  
SPV security is simply about them knowing the transactions you make.  I have made 10K transactions over Electrum and will continue to do so.  
@_date: 2016-07-18 18:44:47
LOL.  That's ok.  I trust Electrum and SPV.  It's what Satoshi envisioned and I'm fine with that.   
I hope the majority of people aren't recommending newbies download Core.  That's absurd.  Bitcoin will not grow like that.
@_date: 2016-07-16 16:35:14
This sub is moderated by people actively pushing to keep blocks small.   Coinbase wants to raise the block size.  This sub's moderators encourage Coinbase bashing.  Hence the many comments.
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:01:42
That's so stupid.  Is that your example?  So I can't also make a fraudulent Core clone that will pretend to accept over 21 million BTC?  Of course I can.  Hell I can make one that will accept 21 billion.  I can even make one that will claim to have done your dishes.
I tell you what, prove to me and everyone that Electrum is faulty.  I'll give you an address and you send me 21 million BTC.  Put your money where your mouth is.

You don't feel like arguing semitics? You are so anti-semitic!
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:45:40
I don't care if they know I'm into midget porn.  I'll tell you and everyone else.  Those midgets can freaking work it bro.  
Now if I'm going to buy some drugs then yeah...I'll use a full client.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:05:11
That's a nice options.  Still most people shouldn't be doing that.  
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:13:17
There are a TON of scams in the cryptcurrency community.  I'm honestly intrigued now by OneCoin.  I'm going to have to look into it.  This community is scared or something.  I've NEVER seen this from the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:57:41
You're being dishonest by suggesting there are risks to SPV besides the provider knowing your transactions.   THAT'S THE ONLY RISK!  Stop pretending else wise.   
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:29:52
Yes...that's ACTUALLY going to happen.  I tell you what, when it does, I'll be suspicious.  I know of no one that owes me 21 million BTC.  If I did, I would be so angry at them.  
So, what really is going to happen.  I'm going to expect X amount from someone.  If I get the wrong amount, I connect to a different server and verify.  Problems Solvedededed.  If they can guess the exact amount someone is supposed to send me...they good...they real good.  
You guys are inventing problems that don't exist.  Hell reputation based back ends solved this problem quite nicely.  
I hope you folks don't plan on using Lightning.  That's totally reputation based.
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:29:49
That's not backing up your claim.  I can display a screen with 21 billion on it.  
Let me know when you're ready to back up your claim you elite haxzor.  I'm ready to give you my address.  
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:36:15
I totally disagree.  I'll NEVER run anything but an SPV wallet.  If I am ever forced to run anything else, I'll give up on Bitcoin.  There is NOTHING an electrum server can do to my transaction other than gain info on my transactions.  
I will NEVER recommend the average user or small merchant run anything but an SPV client.  
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:14:01
It's in the white paper.  Still it's common sense.  If I can't run wallet software on my phone or just run a quick app to transfer money then bitcoin isn't going to grow.  
No one that just wants to quickly and conveniently transfer money is going to want to keep the app running to let it sync.  That's just silly.  
Anyone promoting that is either dumb or wants bitcoin to fail.
@_date: 2016-07-20 06:37:45
I wish Blockstream would announce Lightning was working and we can now do millions of transactions a second.  Hell, I'd rather all the devs be anonymous.   
This is all just a waste of time.  
Other coins are going to beat us if we don't start getting with it.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:52:20
You should stop being vague about the "risks" of SPV.  That's very dishonest.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:53:56
YES, that's the only risk.  The reason you're being vague is because you can't provide any more.  STOP BEING VAGUE AND DISHONEST.
@_date: 2016-07-27 05:09:20
Been here since 2012.  OneCoin has gotten far too many headlines.  It's weird.  
@_date: 2016-07-19 19:32:21
What's wrong with the GPL?
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:32:52
Most people should be running an SPV client.  Bottom line.  This is a STUPID message you're pushing and I hope like hell most people here don't go around spewing this bs.  
It's a HILARIOUS thought imagining my local country ice cream shop running a full node and expecting customers to come in running full nodes on their phones.  Imagining this scenario will work out and allow bitcoin to grow takes a mind that clearly has brain damage.

He wasn't talking about SPV clients.  He specifically said he wasn't.  He just used that one as an example.  He knows SPV clients have solutions to this imagined problem.
You don't even need the alerts.  You need more back end servers to verify what you were sent.  Yes, it's based on trust.  There's no way around it.  Still, this is for receiving which we weren't even discussing in the scenarios we talked about.  
The same will be true with Lightning.  Bottom line, it's not a problem. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:16:51
I had never heard of OneCoin until this sub made it so popular.  This is crazy.  If it's a scam, let it die.  It will.  It's really starting to look like the lady doth protest too much.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:39:24
Hey Greg, when do you think we'll start to see some Lightning?
@_date: 2016-07-19 00:24:21
I would end it too if I suddenly realized I don't have an argument.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:38:31
Don't you still have to download the whole blockchain?  Screw that.
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:43:39
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIN CLIENTS NOT SPV CLIENTS!!!  
With SPV you CAN account for this OR hell, you could even verify with other sources if you didn't trust your provider.  Also, your provider wouldn't remain a provider very long if they pulled shit like that.
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:49:48
He better hurry the hell up.  I'll be posting THERE far more than here.  Why let them steal our contributions?
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:38:30
Once again YOU'RE the one spreading false information.  Hell even in your very example you were dishonest.  
  
Also, "me and Todd"...HAHAHAHHAHA!
