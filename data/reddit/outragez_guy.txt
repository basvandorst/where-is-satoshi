Tunisia = Africa.
Well it's definitely happening, if we're mixing up the content with a country.
Most African countries will be the last to adopt Bitcoin because they already have digital money, which is far more organised, ubiquitous and accepted. That's not to say it's better, I'm just sick of this unfounded borderline racist Bitcoin prophesy about the wild, curious Africans benefiting most from BTC.

You realise this affects the business that operate under Australian regulation more so than it affects the individual. Most importantly it's made purchasing bitcoins from an exchange 10% more expensive

Oh Bitcoin is mainstream. However delivery to Australia is difficult.

I'm really interested to know if there are any places that accept BTC at the POS?

Ahhh that weekly 'Corporation X hinted that it may think about possibly proposing Bitcoin'.
"While Wells made no indication that Netflix is looking to integrate bitcoin, the comments are sure to spark speculation that that company is at least aware of the technology."

CREDIT SUISSE WILL ACCEPT BITCOIN! We just need to send them meek tweets.

This sub is still obsessed about "afrika". They think BTC is revolutionary and African nations are in desperate need.
The reality is that most African countries are saturated with mobile payment and e-commerce solutions. Thinking that btc can compete with homegrown, trusted and deep rooted technologies is a fantasy fueled by our misconceptions about the continent.

I don't think bank regulations have been getting specific with bitcoin, they're just categorising it with all the other shit from the internet.

No, what he explicitly says in every account is that the media outed him, and have been bothering him, his family and his staff for around 6 months now.

That's as bat shit crazy as all the other people in this sub who are militantly against him.

I love this subreddit, but we really have short memories.
Craig was outed in November or something, and since then he's been hounded everyday by shitty blogs, radio talk show hosts and newspapers asking if he's a secret billionaire or funding the russian military.
Then of course they started pestering his family and friends, and finally he came out and admitted it.
I don't know the truth, if he is Satoshi or not, but one thing I know for certain, is that he isn't some publicity scamster trying to get a free attention; and that is exactly how people in THIS VERY SUB are portraying him!

I thought people made the connection in November 2015? So today he announced that he did indeed created bitcoin hoping it would mean that the media would stop hounding him and his family.
