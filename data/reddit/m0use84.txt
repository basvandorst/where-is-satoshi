The only thing I'd write back is "Goodbye"
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:55
Switch to proof of stake. But you wont be alive then.

Could we stop worshipping people, who directly profit from a growing bitcoin value?
I dont give to shits about those 2.

Id rather honor people like Andreas Antonopoulos, who actively help in bitcoin becoming a better thing.
Just repeating "IT WILL GROW IN VALUE" like a parott is something the average reddit writing bitcoin hodler does.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:55:44
It didnt hit 14k ...
It straight went to 14.120$
Didnt see SHIT
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:44:15
Could also drop a bit since some will cash out for gifts.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:50:41
Maybe they should except to activate their taximeter instead and dont try to rip of every customer.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:35:12
NEVER! DONT ENRAGE THE GOD OF HODLING!

The question is, how can Cpt. Americas Shield bounce off the wall, if vibranium absorbs all energy?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:26:36
Or you'll be finished?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:41:44
BUT IT WILL CRASH!!11111
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:06:13
I know, same location here ;) But even IF it crashes to xxxx im still in the black. So keep hodling and everything turns out fine. There were some drops before, it recovered every single time.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:33:08
This just happens. HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:24:55
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:23:10

Evolution theorie might have some flaws, creationism makes the flaw the theorie.

If it hits 9300$ there are 156,5 Coins to be sold before it can reach a higher price. Comparable in a small Scale with "the slaying of the bear whale", which was the sale of 30k coins at 300$
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:21:47
Cause someone pumped and dumped?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:52:31
IT WILL CRASH
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:30:01
The demand is higher than the supply.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:13:45
There might be the 1BTC = 10.000€ before ;)
