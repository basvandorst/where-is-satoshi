Deflation is bad because people would only spend money to stay alive and not buy anything outside of the necessery goods. This meens that the demand for a lot of goods will fall to almost 0 and people would start hording money in the hopes of getting a better deal next month. This would mean companies don't need to produce any goods because there is no demand and they would start laying off workers and this makes people have less buying power which in turn keeps the cycle of less demand going. This makes your economy go bad real fast. They combat this by forcing inflation and making sure people spend their money now and not hoard it hoping for a better deal.

I do agree with you on the savings part. People need to have more in savings just so they can cover any accident that happens.
But on the intrinsic value and the gold standard part we can look at the following articles
For intrinsic value we can look at the uk. This article ( shows that a note worth 20 pounds can be exchanged for the amout of gold equal to 20 pounds. Even with this most people have less then 1000 pounds in savings
