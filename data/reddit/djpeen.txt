dangerous! 
you have to trust that the operator of the site will not change the returned addresses
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:18:59
you can only verify the address if you already know it

Haven't they announced they are about to launch about 10 times now?
Wake us up when they actually do something

true, the wallets would have to account for the txid changing too i suppose

what if someone built a segregated roadway where the fees are cheaper then the old road?
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:33:29
Why not rbf? I guess because the TX is multisig

It's not superficial, what if other s2x implementations had coded the fork correctly, everyone would be out of consensus with each other at an important time

cold wallet transactions are relatively few compared to processing bitcoin withdrawals for the thousands of customers of an exchange

IIRC he had transaction replacement in the original code but it was removed because of dos concerns
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:22:09
It makes sense because the banks can very easily reverse fiat transactions

For merchants probably (if they don't convert all to dollars)

tone was talking bullshit.. but he is not a spokeman of "core"
@_date: 2019-05-25 20:40:35
maybe that would help, im not sure..
certainly it would be nice if people could honestly consider the pros and cons.
for example roger ver repeats his usual talking points about supporting the "bitcoin" that has very cheap transactions, but he does not seem to be able to consider the amount of external costs that are placed on blockchain verifiers
tone vays did not seem to be able to admit that yes bitcoin transactions are more expensive then bitcoin cash, let alone be able to explain why that might be necessary
maybe one problem is we do not have a way to determine what the external costs of validating/storing/transmitting txs are
