I meant most of the people who got into crypto recently. Sorry about that! Most of the people I know got into bitcoin in early 2011 late 2010, so they weren't worried about the price or  cared for it at all. Many of them still hold most of their bitcoin, but tend to use other cryptos more frequently. Although it is nice to see the price in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies go up, from what I've seen the price has increased mostly due to hype. Unfortunately this hype is largely driven by price and not by what bitcoin is or what it could be. This can be seen by the recent alt coin mania where you have all there alt coins that are worth hundreds of millions and have nothing to show for it. All that money is there for the hope that they might succeed in the future and let's be honest not all of them will succeed. Only a few will, maybe

It's just fewer transactions lol

If you are investing into bitcoin because you watched wolf of wall street I don't think your head is in the right place. All I see today is how bitcoin is going to make people easy money, when it's purpose is not to. People think if they put in $1k into btc it will be worth $50k, $100k, etc in the future just so they can cash out the majority into fiat. Doesn't that seem counter productive to what it's goal is?

If you use an exchange it won't matter what you use.

"Take EVERYTHING  you read on r/ bitcoin with a good dose of skepticism - It's openly hostile towards Bitcoin Cash, anything other than Bitcoin, and promotes Bitcoin. "
Remember guys, bitcoin isn't the only crypto currency out there. Just because it was the first doesn't mean it is going to be the only one. I'm not trying to bash OP or anyone, but it's a good thing that a criticize bitcoin and try to talk about it's bad and good qualities as rational people. With the cryptocurrency communities becoming more fragmented, claiming their crypto will rule them all, we need to realize we are all part of a bigger whole. Cryptocurrencies give power the the people without a need of a central authority. I think we still have a long way go, but I know we can get there only if we all stop with all this tribalism behind coins leading to more fragmentation in the crypto community.

Lol how can you be anonymous with btc. The majority of people use exchanges and they can track you from there. Also who is going to stop someone from looking into how much btc you have if you were to go buy something with btc. Even if you use multiple wallets it wouldn't be that hard to go back in the blockchain to track where the btc came from. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:41:59
I will buy your btc

nothing is stopping you from blocking the account yourself lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:39:05
How about we try to consolidate at a decent price first???
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:34:00
Seems like many people bought at an ATH thinking they could make some easy money lol
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:33:01
Doesn't matter Monero is still Monero. Monero will still be here even if it gets banned from governments

People here down voted me when I said it will reach 10k levels or near it again. You can't expect something to go from from 7k and rise to almost 20k in  matter of 2-3 days, without expecting it to have a major correction. This should be a learning experience for many people. Don't let the price influence when you get in, this is simply just greed. This is not an attack on bitcoin, this is simply what happens when greed takes over. This isn't over
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:43:57
Let's be honest here most of the people here got in because of the price, unfortunately
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:12:33
Don't buy it if you just want to cash it out for fiat in the future. No one is guaranteeing you big profits. I'd only recommend buying in if you actually have a use for it

I feel like it is looking bearish. It could consolidate around this range then go up, but if it starts to go to the lower 12k range I can see it hitting 8k, then mooning. I think it's important to take into consideration that to a lot of newcomers  or to non Bitcoin enthusiasts it not looking strong right now so this could be affecting the price. Also with the recent involvement of banks and corporations they are trying to get in on a good price before it reaches new ATHs.

What about actually trying to spend Bitcoins instead of hodling to cash out in fiat
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:42:58
I'm honestly surprised people did not see this coming, like seriously lol
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:38:27
Won't be long before it reaches it again

Both bcash and bitcoin are centralized

Now that I look at it, it is really sad. What I'm about to say is not just about Bitcoin, but about the whole crypto community as a whole. People are only worried about the price of cryptos rather than the idea behind it. I understand that as of right now cryptos are seen as a form of wealth storage, but it shouldn't be that way. Everyone that supports cryptos should not be happy with the way things are headed. Yes, we are seeing all-time highs with many cryptos, but shouldn't we be more worried that Bitcoin as of right now is not sustainable as currency?  Yes, Bitcoin is the most valuable crypto, but as of right now, to me at least, not the most useful. I want to be able to spend my Bitcoin anytime, anywhere. I don't just want to use it to cash out. For all of you that think the LN is a good solution are just wrong, I'm sorry to tell you.  On top of all this, we have people who hold all of their cryptos on exchanges and have never used a wallet. If you ask them how bitcoin or and other cryptos actually work they won't be able to answer. I'm not saying it is the easiest thing to understand, but we as a community need to teach people new to cryptos how things work and what the idea behind cryptos are. People think you can get rich fast by getting into cryptos, which is possible but only if you know what you are doing.  We need to stop pushing the mentality of getting rich off cryptos and start pushing the mentality of actually using them.  I honestly would rather have cryptocurrencies be worth less than they are now, but actually, be used for what they meant to be used for.  
I know this rant is disorganized, but I just needed to vent. PEACE

Just because the price of Bitcoin goes down does not mean that it is being attacked. You can't expect Bitcoin  to go from like 8k in november to almost 20k in december and not expect a price drop
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:28:34
It hasn't ended
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:49:33
There are some cryptos already trying to do this, like skycoin using the skywire mesh Network. You guys should check them out, pretty cool stuff

Make sure to have a wallet to transfer them to. Pm  me if you want me to buy you a ledger nano. I remember I was in high school when I first received my first bitcoin from my older cousin. Times have changed and the biggest tip I can give you is to always keep your cryptos in a wallet that you OWN and to never share it with anyone. 
If you have any questions you can always hmu with a pm. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:21:00
I'm doing the same thing yo. Someone make an article on me pls
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:27:42
Basically 99% of people who got into cryptos last year are the ones who just want get rich  fast lol. Hope one day they will learn their lesson
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:05:14
If you aren't day trading what's the point of watching the price 24/7? I get that there might be major dips or huge rises, but if you are into btc for the long term I honestly don't see the point in watching the price religiously. I'm not trying to bash anyone, I'm just really curious to get some of your guys thoughts on why people who don't even trade actively focus on the price too much. 
I think that focusing  too much  on price is going to hurt btc in the long run

Nice. I'm currently an econ undergrad interested in doing research on crypto markets, more specifically dark markets. Hope everything works out for you!

What if I told you that it will go down?
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:58:22
I will spend my cryptos papa bless

Still like this one though

Just the way things are around here. Just shows how easily people can be manipulated 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:36:08
I find it hilarious that people complain about all these so called crypto finance experts when the price goes to shit, but when the price goes up everyone praises them. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:47:49
I think OP could have worded things better, but I think people commenting are not getting the main point. Many people have made comments saying " why should we spend our BTC immediately," when OP never said you had to. What OP is trying to say is that we should get out of the mentality of just getting into BTC to hodl to cash out into fiat.

How is credits a scam?
@_date: 2018-04-21 17:46:13
Not to long ago sentiment towards crypto was not the best and I believe it still isn't. Just 2-3 months ago people were complaining about high fees in btc, people hoping for a flippening, and how many scams there was and still is. If people immediately disregard issues because they are making those gains, then the fundamentals in the crypto community are fucking screwed. 
Let's take verge as the most recent example. People were complaing on how it is a scam, but then because it managed to get a partnership with PH people started to say this is a good thing for crypto. Like, what the absolute fuck. How is it a good thing that verge, a scam, got a partnership with PH when there was more legitimate options? How is that a good thing for crypto? Increasing adoption by promoting a scam? Give me a break, most people are just into it for the gains, let's be honest. If you want to make money, that's fine, there is no problem , but if people don't at least try to learn what crypto is about then they will get easily manipulated because all they know about crypto is, put a couple grand now and get a lambo in a couple of months
