Two options risk and wait or get it now and it   You get it for sure and it wont matter if it drops for 100 more
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:23:26
so we wait more :D
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:18:50
think a bit more. You are a bit late to sell..
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:47:25
The best thing is to ignore the price and just wait some time
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:23:38
hahah been waiting for this. You are like very FUD i've talked to lately. Couldn't reset password on my old acc. But that doesn't matter. I can be in bitcoin 7 years without reddit you know?
Also if you will be waiting for price to drop you won't win in this game. sometimes you need to risk and buy it. Bitcoin will rise to 6k soon mark my words
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:48:02
hurry up :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:16:56
you people need to stop worrying so much about this. you won't be seeing the price only getting up. it will also go down you know? i can't believe how people panic fast when price drops a bit
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:16:03
told ya
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:22:04
you are late with buying :D
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:09:22
i did at 4100. but i hodl and bought more today
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:10:39
yeah still time to buy some and make some money quick without stress.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:38:10
hold up let me get my crystal ball
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:23:14
no worries i will. i bought more today lel
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:13:05
Hmm..you can't call it fake so fast and u can't call it real so fast... But hey this news are rising the price so why ruining it?
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:06:06

@_date: 2017-09-16 13:07:36

Who is gonna hodl and buy more at correction ? ✋
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:48:47
Dont ask others what to do so many afraid people right now.. No one knows what will happen no one can help you :) it's part of the game
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:53:44
i'm with you brother. bought at 4100 !
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:50:30
