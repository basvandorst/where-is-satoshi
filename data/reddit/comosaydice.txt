Good to know.
Luckily the buy option came back just after you replied, picked up another 5, just in time from the looks of it. R.I.P. btc wall.

Saying that you can buy on the 10th..and that your price is not locked in/transaction can be cancelled at anytime before then isn't really buying. Maybe committing to buy? Minus the commitment part?




Normally buys came back a little later, first time I'd seen that though.

If they don't know the price 5 days from then..how are they charging you for it? They don't charge until they have the bitcoin available to lock in the price..so no they were not offering the option to buy at that time. They were offering the option to buy them on the 10th.
Guess we'll just have to agree to disagree..regardless, buys came back, made my purchase before wall came down. Good to go.

Wow, never heard this before but it sounds plausible enough.

You just described the normal buy process. They lock a price and debit your ACH, when funds clear in 4-5 days the btc become available to transfer/sell (except of course for $1k instant buy daily).
When this happened they did not initiate a transfer and did not lock a price. How can they charge me for the price 5 days from now when they have no idea what that will be?
I cancelled that buy order. Refreshed the page a little later and normal buying had resumed. Placed the order again, price is locked, account transfer initiated, good to go.

This has happened before?
..oh looks like we're back.
