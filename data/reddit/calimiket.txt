What are some examples of things that would make Bitcoin tank to shit?

I don't get it, so now I have to buy my own mini cell phone tower as well?

Why is it a good idea?
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:24:53
Yeah you better get in when it's close to its historical all time high. Clearly that's the best time to invest. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:29:18
Go through his comment history. He regularly posts a very long list of all the sites he uses. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:02:07
This is not an ATM it's a gas pump. CC transaction you can dispute, but if someone steals you ATM pin and uses your card it could go either way. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 02:24:16
There's a law preventing banks from doing that now. There's a limit to how many overdrafts in a day and I believe stacking transactions like you mentioned is outlawed completely. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:27:33
If you bought at 1000 you lost a 100 dollars. I bought in at under 700 so I'm up 300. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:36:44
Sounds like you got it all figured out. You should really shoot to make %12-20 on your investments FYI. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 23:41:15
Are bitcoins going to be removed from existence? Demand may go up but I don't see how the supply will be decreased.

It's most definitely "within their control." It's a private company. As long as they are not discriminating against someone or violating your civil rights they can most definitely deny you service for any reason they choose.

I was at work all day man. I pmed it to you this morning and posted as requested now. How was i supposed to know to post to the comment? I responded by the end of the day. I really think it's unfair that you edited the terms of the agreement and may not pay just because I responded to that edit hours too late. It still Wednesday where I am at. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:45:04

I'm not really sure what you're getting at. You're right to buy low and sell high. Btc is not at a low right now, its near its all time high.

@_date: 2016-11-10 05:19:46
$250 total. More since i bet in bitcoin. And apparently more since sreaka has said i don't get paid because i didn't post to the comment even though i PMed my address day of, and commented now. I think its unfair that he altered the terms of the deal and decided not to pay because I responded to that alteration hours too late. If I don't get paid within a day I'm calling the bitcoin police. 
Edit: u/sreaka paid up and is standup guy/girl.

Would this be avoided by buying the bitcoin from coinbase then transfering to a paper wallet then buying the drugs?
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:47:39

If you're in northern california you can pay for weed with bitcoin and and have it deivered by a prompt and professional human being. If you want me to sit across the street and drone it to you i will. This is available now.

Nobody uses paper checks anymore. I'll agree that its better than the ATM/Credit card, but the ATM card does have the advantage of giving me cash that for all intents and purposes is not traceable. Yes there are serial numbers and large amounts of cash are traced, but as far as i can tell if i want to buy and item that's 100 dollars or less i can do it much more clandestinely with ATM/Cash than i can do with bitcoin. Still a supporter, still buying bitcoin every pay period.
@_date: 2015-08-16 23:58:45
Ok fine, checks are very rarely used and not a good comparison to bitcoin.

This mis-understanding of value among users of Bitcoin is my biggest fear of adopting its use. I might sound ridiculous to you and your echo chamber, but I am correct. 
Why does the word intrinsic exist?
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:21:03
You're correct about the spelling. The rest is TLDR.

Yeah this is the ridiculous line of thinking. Where does the "no such thing as intrinsic value" concept come from? Who originally made this Kool-Aid?
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:02:15

The drug trade is like a pyramid with the producers/top dealers on top and the drug addicts on the bottom. The whole idea of taking out the top guy is flawed, they are quickly and easily replaceable. If they really wanted to solve the drug problem they would help the addicts at the bottom. Then the whole thing will come down or be much smaller due to reduced demand.
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:14:51
Gold will not drop to 3$ an ounce. People in this sub have perverted what intrinsic value means. At the bare minimum, gold looks nice and is the single most malleable metal on the planet. It has intrinsic value. Just because you nuts don't accept this fact doesn't make it any less true.

Isn't BF4 free now? Why would anyone pay $44 for it?

I've had this argument multiple times. I'd rather just enjoy my day. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:43:18
No, i fully understand. For some reason you are replacing inherent/intrinsic value with this subjective theory bullshit. The fact of the matter is humans are here, they aren't going away and items have intrinsic value. What I don't understand is how you can explain in your posts what intrinsic value is, and then go on to explain that it doesn't exist.

Oh wait  now I understand. The "they" I was referring to is you. And I thought you were suggesting to the developers to not give a hard date and I was joking th at no hard date was given since "by end of the year" isn't a hard date. Just disregard me I'm an idiot.

@_date: 2015-03-19 05:40:20
I understand how Bitcoin works, it's not physical money. Is there a site like evolution/Silk Road that uses this multi-signature system? According to another comment in this section, there is no such market. So wtf are people who want to buy drugs supposed to do?
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:50:45
It's my understanding that Evolution acts as some sort of intermediate. If Evolution didn't hold the bitcoins, what would stop the buyers of the drugs from ripping of the sellers or vice versa?
@_date: 2016-10-02 22:42:19
Thank you. This looks good. Do you know if they also have the best odds?

Yeah i can't get the exchange to work. I've emailed coinbase and am awaiting a response. I want to buy if the price dips below 200. Just hoping that doesn't happen while im asleep tonight or tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:16:15
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:34:12

@_date: 2015-02-10 19:07:45
When people are wrong on reddit they stoop to taking shots on people's grammar and spelling. It's a sign that you're wrong. You should continue with deflection and personal attacks since that's all you have.

Wouldn't it have to be "most" people instead of some people for this to be true?
@_date: 2015-02-10 06:57:07
your comments is pretty and inspiring but it has little intrinsinc value in the real world of trade and finance.

Is it dangerous to receive Bitcoin from them? 
@_date: 2015-02-18 08:31:37
Is it dangerous to recieve the small amount of Bitcoin they pay out?
@_date: 2015-02-10 06:55:06
Whatever man. You know exactly what I mean, and gold has it Bitcoin doesn't. Gold will still have value in 100 years, bitcoins a maybe.
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:42:08
Because some drugs are extremely difficult to acquir regularly.

Is this the same one or can you hook me up too?
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:01:34
No, I fully understood your point you're just simplifying the definition of value. I think the whoosh is you not understanding the difference between intrinsic value and value. A dollar of gold has more intrinsict value then a paper dollars worth of gold, the same thing applies to Bitcoin. I'll take gold over Bitcoin 11 out of 12 months of last year, and if you wouldn't I would like to buy all your gold with Bitcoin please.
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:49:27
I don't think this post will make it that long, I need to get rich now! :P

Is there an easy step by step instruction on how to do this? When i googled "setup my own bitcoin wallet" most of the links are to coinbase. I am now even more paranoid picking witch instructions to follow and who's reputable.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:41:12
I am not computer literate, that's why I'm asking this question. Im hoping for easy, but I guess I need to download some sort of app or program to do this for me.
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:03:49
Just because you don't agree with my facts doesn't make them any less true. Trying to apply your belief that value is a man made simple term to an intricate system that is FIAT money is the dumb move. You are under 30 years of age for sure. You should write a letter to wikipedia, or dictionary.com explaining why they should remove the term "intrinsic value" then post it to r/funny.
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:22:32
Is it possible to pay someone .05 to make a bot to do it?

It's already out. I just personally cannot get it to work, but others have.
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:03:44
I've never had this work so far. Please prove me wrong.
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:23:56
You know what your right on it being relative valuation. Gold is worth something just by being what is, those little bits in a computer aren't worth anything on their own.
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:38:07
It's not tanking hard enough, im not getting in unless is drops below $200.

You have single-handedly reduced my confidence in Bitcoin. No I don't see the irony in my post, it's coincidental that I'm attacking you but not ironic. Irony has to do with opposites. Although I wouldn't expect a "truther" to understand anything.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:38:08
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. If a nuclear bomb blew up half the people on earth, gold would still have value, bitcoin would not.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:06:36
"There is no such thing as intrinsict value"
Brain explodes.
Where did you hear this incorrect theory? Let me guess, someone talking about Bitcoin? What a coincidence.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:47:48
