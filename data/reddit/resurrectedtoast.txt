So if ISP's start blocking bitcoin, how do I pay for my coffee (once it becomes the new standard)?




No one will use something that's not easy.


Well then that would be like 150 years too late, by then there will be a new standard. So when bitcoin is replace by "futurecoin" it will already be too late.


Yeahhh, that has nothing to do with this conversation.

So like gold?


Except the people who control the internet?


As long as the blockchain doesn't get compromised?

So basically it's just something people agree is valuable? Like gold, or seashells a thousand years ago?


But what about the fact that ISP's control the transfer of funds, and they only care about making USD (or GBP, or whatever)?


You mean like how the United States sticks to feet and fahrenheit rather than moving to metres and celsius? That seems to work OK.


Umm, that already exists. Hate speech laws.

Okay, I see it now. 


So what happens if the government tells ISP's they have to stop allowing bitcoin transactions on their network?


I agree, but in reality that will *never* happen, so what makes you think bitcoin will become a "new standard"?


What I think (for the record, I'm on your side, as I said, I'm playing devil's advocate) is irrelevant. It's what everyone else thinks that matters, and if everyone else can't even agree to how to measure distance and temperature, it seems unlikely they can agree on currency.

Nah, not bitter AT ALL. As I said, I would have cashed them in for $1000 (or less) because I didn't really "get it" back then, so whatever.


I often wonder about this because of my experience. Like, people like to compare BTC to gold, etc (being general here), but it doesn't really work like that.
You can't take gold out of existence like what I did with those bitcoins. Sure, you could drop a big lump of gold to the bottom of the ocean, but it's still there. It's entirely possible to permanently destroy bitcoins.
This makes me wonder if at some point some multi-billion dollar bank/corporation will just buy a huge chunk of them and destroy them (or hide them) to change the value. 
There are a finite number of bitcoins out there, so if someone wants to destroy them they could.
For example, right now, Apple could buy every bitcoin out there and just "destroy" them if they thought they were a threat to Apple Pay or whatever. This is why I can't really take the whole thing too seriously. 
I'll prepare myself for downvotes now because of that last statement.

Oh dude, that HDD died and went to HDD heaven at least 2-3 years ago after it being formatted and having tons of content moved to/from it for a couple of years before that.
As I said..."Gone Forever".
*pours drink on ground*
**EDIT**: The HDD would have originally been purchased around...2007ish. Used in that original desktop until that GPU died and I just bought a laptop since I didn't care about gaming anymore in in 2010/2011ish, then used again from say 2012/2014ish. It's all really foggy because none of it was a big deal at the time...

Yes! CUDA! I forgot about that. 
I think the card I used was an Nvidia 9800GT (wow, that just popped back into my head after seeing CUDA typed out).
Regarding power rates: I was living in a "power included" apartment at the time, I used to run all kinds of distributed computing things on my PC (ie. Seti other BOINC programs, etc).
As I said in my replies to other people, the dates are really fuzzy because none of it mattered at the time. It was just a hobby, an experiment.
It was maybe 2-3 years ago when bitcoin started popping up in lots of different news stories, etc, that I remembered my "experiment" and had that sinking feeling... So it goes.

The drive is smashed up in a landfill somewhere...

Fair enough, you know more than I do! :)

This happened to me, on a MUCH smaller scale, and they're gone forever.
Heard about bitcoin back in 2010ish. Had a decent gaming PC back then. Tried it out just for fun, mined like 100-200 BTC. GPU died for unrelated reasons.  I was losing interest in gaming and didn't bother to replace it. Just used the integrated graphics on that desktop (and forgot about BTC mining) until I had money to buy a laptop to replace the aging desktop.
Used the laptop for a year or two before I decided to turn the old desktop into a HTPC. Took a quick look at what was on the HDD, didn't even notice the BTC wallet (or whatever it would have been called back then, I don't know) software on there. Didn't see anything "important", so I formatted it and filled it with movies and stuff.
Didn't even remember about my experiment with mining at the time, remembered it a few years later when BTC stories started getting posted everywhere online. 
Today I'd have between say $100,000 - $200,000 worth of BTC.
I try not to think too much about it...
**EDIT**: I should mention I don't really lose sleep over this b/c there's no way I would have held onto them for this long. I probably would have exchanged them when they were worth say $1000 so I could buy myself a fancy TV or something. I was never "invested" in the future of BTC (and to be honest, I'm not now, I just subscribe to this sub because I find the concept fascinating and want to see where it leads) so it's not like I'm actually out $200,000...

...are you a hoarder? Have you ever moved and had to drag a bunch of crap from once place to another? 
If something is broken, I throw it away...
**EDIT**: Also, the first HDD I owned was 40MB... Massive storage!

Yeah, honestly I don't even remember how it worked. I'm not young, I would have been 30 in 2010, and I'm a nerd so I probably read/heard about it from some random forum (or Reddit) and just set it up on a lark.
I used to do lots of BOINC stuff (like Seti the protein folding one to help research cancer, etc). I was into "distributed computing" in general, and just remember thinking "Huh, BTC, neat. It's a distributed computing thing that could also potentially make me a few bucks".
So I ran a miner for a while, and the wallet software that did verifications, etc, and that was that.

Yup. Everytime I access a page on coinbase.com a new vault is created. Refresh the page? NEW VAULT! Click on Settings? NEW VAULT!
