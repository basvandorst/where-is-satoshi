Seeing as I control the ink industry in one of those parallel universes, I'm a freakin gazillionaire!  
Also, I have a harem of supermodels and a golden weiner.

Obviously, I was being facetious, but thanks, I'll pay it forward the next time I can superficially invalidate a contention of mine by gifting some BTC!

I just spent electricity and computer cycles to create this reply.  I DEMAND BTC for this!

That list is as of May 2013, not current.

Why would you sell low?

That's without taking into account that the list of Proper Nouns is really really freaking long.  I say, good password.

The market can be irrational longer than you can be solvent.  IOW, There is NO predicting of price that is even remotely reliable in the short term.  Long term....well, start with the about 100 million users who would make a viable base for BTC to be a real currency, and see what 21 million coins divided by that is.

Same here.

What ESL wrote that?

Thank you. I was mystified.  I guess it pays to read the whole thing?

^ this guy is a scam, BFL isn't.  They're just slow to deliver sometimes on their promises

But if you tell them it is for a password, so the words NEED to be random, they probably won't choose "my really good password."
Well, actually, history teaches us that's EXACTLY what they would choose.  Never mind, carry on...
