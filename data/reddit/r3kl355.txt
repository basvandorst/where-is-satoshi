Jaxx? Because you dont have a desktop wallet listed that can handle anything except BTC.
Dont dump Coinbase or Gdax. Just because they're unpopular atm, they are still a better bet for beginners than many on this list.

Looking through your post history, every single post in on r/bitcoin. Every single post is you being negative, attacking it, trying to bring it down. wtf man, why are you here? Are you getting paid for this?

Did the same at the last peak a couple weeks back, mid 7000s. Look at it now, wish I’d kept them. Looking to buy back in once the price drops, who knows if it will enough to my liking though.

1. Download and install an program called Electrum
2. Open it and create a 'Wallet' , it will lead you through the steps.
3. Click the 'Receive' tab and copy the contents of the 'receiving address' field.
4. Log into Coinbase and click the 'Accounts' Tab. Hit the 'Send' button next to your bitcoin wallet. Paste in the address you copied from Electrum and send.
5. Wait until the bitcoin appears in your Wallet.
6. Make sure you print or write down your 'seed' phrase and keep it in a safe place.

You can fill your USD wallet on Coinbase ahead of time, let it sit there, and buy BTC immediately when the time is right.
FYI, using Wire transfers between my Bank (Ally) and Gemini, i get about a 1 day deposit / withdrawal turn around. There is also no limit to amounts either.

Tell her, that’s what a relationship is about- If you do see future with this relationship that is. If in doubt, set some aside hidden. But keeping shit from one another festers, either way. But from experience, the longer a relationship goes the more truths we keep from one another anyway, many obvious to the other partner. Don’t ask don’t tell sorta thing. hmm 
Interesting post my man, having to weigh the worth or your relationship and the worth of your coin. 
Guess it comes down to how much you trust her, and you are not sure you can.
