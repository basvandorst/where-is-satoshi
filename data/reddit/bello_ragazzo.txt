Just know that coinbase has access to your bitcoin. If they were to get hacked you can kiss your bitcoin goodbye. 
Look into getting a paper wallet or a hardware wallet so you are in control of your keys if you want to be more secure. 
There would be a fee involved whenever you send bitcoin to another wallet.

How does localbitcoins determine their price??? Is it just an average of the prices in their adds? Or an average of the confirmed transactions?

Is there an extra fee to buy BTC from this ATM? How is the exchange rate calculated? Does it follow an exchange, or an average of the exchanges or what?

Im in a similar bind and I hear bad things about virtex... Can Canadians not join bitstamp?
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:18:52
I must say that I like everything about this.  What's the status on getting these in Canada?

So you're telling me that the mass media controls the price of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:31:20
This is bad for bitcoin right?
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:55:37
Bitcoin can definitely be stolen. There are ways to secure your bitcoin though. Look into cold storage and paper wallets

And what about the unobtainium?

We all pay for those charges.  And guess what...  We all pay for those precious reward points too.

Well,  the credit card companies charge the retailers a percentage of each transaction (usually 3% in Canada) and in turn the retailers have adjusted their pricing to pass that charge on to the consumer.  Do you seriously think the credit card companies are losing money on points and fraud reimbursement?
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:46:48
You pay for it indirectly.  As a business owner I have to incorporate the cost of running my business in the products that I sell.  Otherwise I would simply lose money.  I don't accept credit cards...  But if I did, I would have to account for that extra cost.  Otherwise I would be losing money. It's actually quite simple.
