Very true. In my opinion, even you someone doesnt plan on carrying, or even owning a gun, EVERYONE should take a gun safety class. I wouldnt even mind my taxes going towards something like this.

Is most of reddit anti gun? I most definitely plan to protect myself within my rights. 50 cents is cheap for hollow point, link that to me boi!

I didnt realize i said anything against women shooting. Simply commenting on the negative implications the above comment made about someone being a "tough guy" for carrying a handgun.

No alone, i started 2 weeks ago. Better than nothing i suppose.

Dont need to be a tough guy to want to protect yourself.

Kinda, known about it for years. Never really understood what it was until friday morning. Went target shoot with a guy who bought 30 coins when they were 300ish last year. He hyped me up a bit. Educated myself for several hours that evening, and bought in this morning!

So the 10 days is normal? That is all I wanted to clarify really. If thats the case a may just set up daily small transfers of 5-10 dollars.
