Think logically about what you just wrote.  Its a total scam.
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:38:12
No, larger pools are not more profitable.  To the contrary, my experience has been they are less profitable because they skim off the pool and/or charge large fees for PPS payouts.  Your assumption is that all miners are large operations and that simply is not the case.  There are still many smaller operations that collocate their equipment.
I have experienced this first hand.  I have hundreds of miners.  I made the mistake using these pools until I ran the statistics and found it was a joke.  I now use a mid sized pool and have never looked back.
@_date: 2016-04-10 14:57:05
This is a fundamental misunderstanding of where miners actually are.  There are large percentages of miners who are not located in China that mine on Chinese pools.  This is not so black and white.  I run a large mining operation and I can tell you there are several large operations in the US now and several in development.  Some of those machines are pointed to Chinese pools - does that make them Chinese?  Those miners can be moved within seconds to a Canadian or European pool if the machine operators choose.
The issue is not so black and white.  Mining is much more decentralized than the drive by headlines would lead you to believe.  The centralization assumption is always that we are operating in a vacuum and that the individual miners have no choice in the matter.

Odd, I had no issues at all.  The interface is night and day in my opinion - not even close.
@_date: 2016-04-11 17:49:40
You think Bitgo is buggy versus Coinkite?  I moved to Bitgo after Coinkite closing and it is so much smoother and the interface is much more user friendly.  Coinkite was clunky at best.  Multisig was nice but processing took a long time and didn't always work.

To reduce their variability of payouts.  If you are funding your costs via the bitcoin you mine, you have to have some stability in payouts.
@_date: 2016-04-11 17:54:52
My opinion is it is lack of understanding of how mining works.  There are much more efficient pools available.  The most efficient age not Chinese pools.  The problem is one of educating yourself on what pool actually offers the best overall value in terms of lowest orphan rates, highest fees per block, etc.  Also service level of the operator and responsiveness to miner requests.  The Chinese pools are well known but fail in most of these respects.  Total hash rate is not relevant.  You can make more money on  mid tiered pool that is well managed, doesn't skim the pool, and charges decent fees.
@_date: 2016-04-10 14:28:06
He is great 
@_date: 2016-04-10 22:53:02
Personally I would opt to pool mine unless I have about 10 PH of mining power.  The pool does not increase your profitability, but it does decrease the variability in found blocks.  This in turn reduces the variability in your revenue.  So basically you don't make more, you make more consistent revenue.
In the long run you will make just as much with 1 petahash on a pool as you will by solo mining.
@_date: 2016-04-10 22:57:42
I agree.  I think that other factors will become just as important to mining and electrical costs as the network grows.  China has the upper hand now because of cheap or free electricity.  The problem they have is latency.  As the market matures, I believe latency will counter cheap electricity and the Western countries will have an advantage.  I also dont believe that free electricity in some countries will last especially as the demand for Megawatts increases.
This is a very interesting and dynamic market and ultimately I believe there will be a evening of the playing field based on many factors, not just kwH cost.
@_date: 2016-04-16 14:02:45
Miners join larger pools to reduce the variability of of their payouts.  That is all the larger hash rate does for you.  My payouts in the long run will be the same mining solo or mining on a 200PH pool.  But the consistency of my payouts will be dramatically different.
The problem is that these larger pool can skim off the top easily as it is very difficult to detect.  Almost all of these pools cheat.
Here is a great website to see some interesting statistics on orphan rates, profitability, etc.  You can see how some of the smaller pools are actually much more efficient that the huge pools.
 
@_date: 2016-04-14 02:53:56
Where are you getting your orphan rate facts?  I can tell you for a fact that larger pools are not always as profitable as smaller pools - I have lived it.
I am not saying anyone is stupid.  I have invested 100s of thousands of dollars in mining equipment.  There are many choices and its takes constant evaluation and verification.  You also have to know the right people.
@_date: 2016-04-21 03:30:00
You don't make more income mining solo.  If you find a block you get a bigger one time payoff of 25btc  rather than split in a pool, but you will not get consistent payoffs.  Mining solo does not make you more money.  The purpose of a pool is to reduce the block finding variability - that is it.  Miners with low hash rate cannot afford to mine solo because they have to pay regular bills and they will have large variation in revenue.
@_date: 2016-04-16 14:11:18
Agree on the perception.  This is really because of the media and centralization hypsters like James Dangelo.  The problem is no one talks to real miners before they make these claims.  Their ideas are based on anecdotal evidence.  
I am not concerned at all that mining will be centralized.  Incidentally, what are we comparing the bitcoin mining centralization to?  The current banking system?  The bitcoin network is an amazing example of the free market at work.  A system that has grown from obscurity to the most powerful and secure network in the world.  There is no central mining company that spearheaded that growth.
The people subscribing to the centralization myth never address what their comparison is.  
James Dangelo wants a representative mining governance model - LOL - really?  That would breed corruption that we have now in the political system.

Check out bitcoin.com - good info.  I would recommend Airbitz - great wallet - you can buy and sell BTC, get discounts at Starbucks, Target - nice UI.
Putting a portion of your investments in BTC is a good move and will help your diversification.
@_date: 2016-04-10 23:07:05
Unfortunately there is no way to calculate this unless the pool operators would release this information.  If they did, I think people would be surprized to number of miners on Antpool, BTCC, Ghash, etc. from countries other than China.
Many of these top mining pools are not based in China - Slush, Kano, Bitminter, Bitfury, BitClub, KNC. Eliguis, Johnny Bravo.  If you take that into account and a significant percentage of the Chinese pools being made up of non-Chinese individual miners, the story is different.
 
@_date: 2015-12-13 19:20:18
Correct, there is not direct incentive, but most miners I know run them as nodes are required for the network to exist, therefore, there is an indirect incentive to run one.  You can run one with a RPi, a mini PC, etc which uses less than 10 watts.
@_date: 2015-12-13 19:16:44
I have a Bitseed, it works great.  I also have Bitcoin Core running on this mini PC -  - works great

@_date: 2016-03-06 03:39:40
Agree and that makes sense.  As you can see though the fee spike was only temporary as it has been during the last few spam attacks.  The system really works the way it should.  I think the question is really about what Bitcoin is.  Solutions like Rootstock are going to change the debate significantly.
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:36:38
You can run a node for next to no cost on an RPi or a Bitseed.  I also have a node in a low cost micro PC.  Running a node is not expensive.

You are illuminating your ignorance on the subject.
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:30:51
Wrong.  How do you expect mining to be supported long term after the block reward subsidy reduces?  Fees will be essential to maintaining the security of the network.

No that is not correct.  If fees are to high they will not last for a long time.  The demand for bitcoin will decline if it is too expensive as people opt for other services.  This is a dynamic market not happening in a vacuum.

Well thought out post and I agree 100%.  If you listen the the Epicenter Bitcoin interviews of Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell you will get a much better understanding of the issues and a calm and reasoned approach to scaling.  
I also thought Classic had it right but I was totally wrong and jumped to that conclusion too soon.  I made the mistake of just wanted some action, any action.
After reading much more and watching all the interviews it is clear that Core us the way to go.  We need to increase capacity but not at the risk of centralization.  Bitcoin needs to scale via sidechains.  It will never be the end all be all.  We need backwards compatibility and we need people who know what they are doing making these changes.
After reviewing all this information and video there is no indication whatsoever that Adam Back has some sort of hidden agenda.  The bottom line is he knows the base system and risks as well as anyone and he is vital to the smooth scaling of Bitcoin.  
I guarantee you that if it comes down to it, the people that have millions of dollars riding on this will choose Core.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:49:25
Also look at Ledger - I use that as well and it has the dynamic fee capability and you can keep your keys offline.
@_date: 2016-02-27 18:29:19
Assuming constant or increasing demand the effect is a decrease in available supply.  The point still stands, there will be less available than in demand and the price will rise.
@_date: 2016-02-25 02:57:06
No one is disagreeing that the block size does not need to be increased at all.  They are disagreeing on by how much an how to do it in the lowest risk way possible. 
Bitcoin is not designed to be only a payment rail.  It is designed to be a utility and foundation for other systems.  Forgetting that core principle will compromise the security of the system.
The debate is not about block size.  It's about what Bitcoin really is. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:34:22
You are free to choose how you like.  When it comes down to it and people have millions of dollars of investment on the line, I will guarantee you, they will not be risking it on a hard fork.  The system works.  It needs optimization, but it has to be done by people who know what they are doing.  The smart, large money will always be with Core.  Book it.

Right for restaurants I think they estimate the tip for instance to verify you have enough in the account to pay the tip.  If you click on the transaction in the app on your phone it will show you the hold amount.  I have only gotten holds at non fast food type restaurants and gas stations.

It will go through it will just take some time.  What wallet are you using?  I would recommend Mycelium where you can   choose easily a priority fee.  Don't listen to all the hysteria about fees.  I do hundreds of transactions per month and have never had issues through the spam attacks or otherwise.

Why can't Bitcoin be the root chain for thriving chains built on top of it like Rootstock, Factom, Ligthning.  Why does it have to be all things for all applications?  When the increase is needed, the appropriate action will be taken.  Give the market the ability to make that choice.  Like Andreas says - he is for Classic and Core and Unlimted, etc.

I have a fairly large farm and you have to plan for no price increase although increasing demand and decreasing supply make that unlikely.  We have transitioned to the most efficient miners.  Bottom line is you have to have the lowest cost possible and the most efficient equipment.  Mining is a competitive business and you have to run it as such.
That said, if the price does not go up significantly there will he a shock to the market.  Hash rate will decrease dramatically and difficulty will go down dramtically.  The end result being a new equilibrium hash rate based on the 12.5 btc block reward, current price, and difficulty.
I was a economics major as well as this is about as close to those perfect competition graphs as you can get.  It's a beautiful thing.
