The vulkan API could end directx's reign of supremacy though. That would be a good start. 
Then again Microsoft might actually be having some foresight here and is making their titles windows 10 exclusives as well as allowing all current and future Xbox exclusives to run on windows 10 as well. As it is windows has all the inertia so all it would really take is one or two killer apps to keep people tied into windows and get older windows version users to upgrade. 
Then we have stuff like Photoshop, Ableton, FL studio, etc. I know these run on windows and Mac but how about Linux?  Gaming is one massive piece of the puzzle but if all the major productivity software is OSX and Windows and you're stuck finding open source alternatives that's a no-go for many. 
I guess lastly there's just familiarity too. I'm a windows power user and have only lightly dabbled in Linux distros for fun and digital security, and from the bit of basics you'll learn from rooting Android phones and being a power user on that platform too. However a new OS might intrigue me, I know that absolutely none of my gaming friends would be willing to learn a new OS even if the performance was just as good. There would need to be a serious delta in Linux's favor for them to even consider it and I'm sure I'd be on constant tech support helping them adjust.

Certain skills and knowledge becomes irrelevant over time and in certain settings.
It's not that they're stupid, but that their knowledge is significantly less applicable if not entirely.
As for Bitcoin itself, I agree with what you're saying, however if someone doesn't understand technology and software in general their opinion on the matter is entirely worthless.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:49:28
Or maybe it's hard time to embrace one of the newer coins that doesn't need to use as much electricity as a small country to secure its chain and is actually instant and zero fee inherently rather than through layers of Band-Aids. 
I mean don't get me wrong, Bitcoin made it all happen but the coin is just so inferior these days and PoW mining also really needs to go too, it's just way too wasteful and incentivizes extremely wasteful behavior.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:44:06
I'm not going to lose credibility by shilling the coins I'm speaking about here.  I'm well aware that the coins that are PoW with a different mining algorithm and block size are *mostly* only cheaper and faster due to being significantly less used than BTC.  None of those coins represent a real alternative to what BTC does or solves any new problem.  They're merely baby steps along the natural evolution cycle of cryptocurrency.
There are at least two coins that although new, completely address the issues of PoW mining resource costs and the issues of tx fees and speeds in ways that are entirely scalable.  Even the cryptocurrency that ends up actually being usable as a currency isn't one of these two I'm speaking of for whatever reason, be it a fatal flaw that pops up or simply this being the first wave of real innovation in coins that actually function as digital currency and something even better will come along, the sheer proof of concept we're talking about here is enough to unequivocally leave BTC dead in the water on a sheer level of technology.
Even if the cultural inertia of BTC being the first to the market is so strong that it never ends up truly replaced, I would bet my entire portfolio that it simply won't be able to compete in the daily spending category, so it will never be able to replace money as people use it.


There's nothing insecure about the other coins I'm speaking of either, it's simply a significant evolution of blockchain technology.  If a newer coin is just as secure, decentralized, and irreversible as BTC but is also inherently instant and free and much easier to use than having other layers of bandaids and hoops to jump through simply to send and receive it, it would naturally replace it as both a long term secure storage as well as the currency you'd use to buy a coffee with.  Just like how most people currently have a savings account as well as a checking account in the currency of their nation.
All that aside. regardless of my opinions on the technology and whether or not mass adoption and opinion changes anything, at a bare minimum here you can't argue that PoW mining is an extremely wasteful endeavor.  So long as it is profitable, it will continue to be a huge energy sink because people will compete for rewards and miner fees.  If it one day becomes unprofitable to mine then it ends up requiring the charity of dedicated mining and runs a huge risk of decentralization or even the old fear of hashrate attacks on the blockchain.  There is really no in between or alternate solutions here so long as PoW mining exists.
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:42:23
Isn't that actually quite accurate though?  For the record, I'm not taking sides. I don't think traditional PoW coins even have a long term future anyway and don't hold any.

I mean in the sense that it's the original decentralized vision. Blockstream isn't exactly a shining beacon of the people.
While bch is absolutely a fork, they forked off to not change rather than going with the change of btc.
Again, I don't have a horse in the race though.

ETH is probably the most stable, recognized, and accepted other than BTC (LTC would probably have the same problems as BTC if it was as widely used). I personally don't imagine ETH will go down much if at all and could still grow a good amount, but mostly I like it because it can be used like digital currency should. 
If you're not just looking for a straight up currency replacement and want to invest in something with good technology and growth potential, XRB, XMY, and VTC are all coins I've chosen on a basis of the technology and dev teams supporting them. Yes, disclaimer, I'm holding small amounts of these coins, by all means do your own research too. So far though I've had success with choosing coins based on technology rather than fads and what's currently popular. However, I'm more of a longer term investor and I rarely day trade. If you're to flip coins and day trade often then you'll want to just follow the trends rather than pick coins on their own merits and potential future.
XRB is similar to iota, no mining, no fees, literally instant transactions and this should continue to be instant even under massive load. This is a coin gaining a lot of attention and isn't even on any major exchange yet. I'm expecting some big growth in early 2018. 
XMY is a blockchain using five separate hashing algorithms for increased blockchain security, decentralisation, and should be something that can be mined by anyone. They've also successfully used some kind of mining-voting consensus to fork one of the five algorithms to a new one without any issues so it should be able to do so again in the future if necessary. Currently 4 of the algorithms are mined by asics and one by CPU (yescrpyt). They used to have a GPU algorithm or two and will probably vote out the least essential asic algo and have another one good for GPU mining again in the future. Their mantra is essentially to have everyone able to mine forever. This multi chain also keeps transactions fast and fees low. It's been around since 2014 with solid support and has finally started to be noticed and gone up in value considerably in the past week. 
VTC is basically just anti asic. They've forked in the past when an asic was going to be able to mine an they'd do it again if necessary. This will most likely always be a GPU coin. I'm not sure if technology wise what being anti asic does other than decentralisation, but if the above two coins have better technology behind them, the devs working on this coin are fantastic and the market has been receptive to and treated VTC well. It's been stagnant lately, but had gone from about $0.70 to $9 a month or two ago. It's one of those coins that might end up being one of the few to go up and break the $100 mark. I believe it will be getting coinbase or other direct USD markets soon and will also be getting lighting network swaps with LTC. In my opinion if it gets coinbase and USD markets as well as lighting swaps, it'll instantly become a better LTC. 
Again, I am invested in these three coins, so understand that while I'm explaining why I believe in these coins and why I'm invested in them, of course I have all the incentives in the world to tell other people to invest in these coins too so if you're interested, I'd recommend looking at the coins on market cap and the checking out their respective sub-Reddits first.

Exactly. I mean yeah, I love the technology and concept and as someone living overseas it would be fan-fucking-tastic if crypto was widely accepted and I could just easily buy shit in person or online with something like NANO, but I've mostly been investing because I expect the value to go up, period. 
Ideally I'll be able to use my coins directly in the not so far future, but ultimately the goal is to increase finances regardless of what form they take. 
I refuse to believe anyone that isn't in this for financial reasons unless they're already multi-millionaires, and even then only if they only have a token amount of coins.

P2P pools already do this, they just aren't popular enough.  Most people are lazy and simply want to copy a bat file off of a pools getting started section.


They wouldn't be a problem if p2p pools were used.  As a matter of fact, I'd be worried of the sheer resources it would require to keep moving the BTC blockchain without asics honestly.
I personally don't use ASICs and I'm not interested in them, but the fact is, they exist and they aren't going anywhere.  Say BTC forked to a newer algorithm that was "asic proof".  It would pretty much only be temporary because simply put, when there's a will, there's a way, and money is a hell of a motivator.  As much as I'd love a more even playing field, I can't personally see a way to solve this issue.  The other issue is, if ASICs were rendered invalid, you'd burn the middle level miners quite hard who may have invested heavily into an asic or two, where as the top dogs will write it off and throw money at the next best thing if it's viable.
Edit: should have read the whole thing before typing.  I see that you addressed p2p pools and you're right, they're not perfect, but I would argue they are better than standard pools and one could create a node quite easily if they were too far away from a usable node.  Forking it into the system would be a great way to handle this if possible.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:03:57
Well, someone is paying for that power.  As long as it's no one you care about that's your decision.
As for mining, you must be connected to the network to mine regardless of pool and solo.

I can definitely vouch for this. I've had a few rare times where I genuinely enjoyed having a gaming laptop, but more often than not realized it wasn't necessary at all, and plenty of times I wished I could upgrade my specs or had a more mobile laptop for work/school. 
These days I recommend friends and family to build a desktop for gaming and get a Chromebook, tablet, or simple windows laptop for their mobile use.  Other than one person who was genuinely best off with a gaming laptop, they all preferred the experience of a dedicated mobile and home system

Anything that threatens the status quo gets the Axe. The good thing is, it's hard to fuck with crypto currency.

Ah I see. Totally depends on the hardware and what your kilowatt hour cost is. Asics are generally power efficient. Basically use something like coinwarz.com.  punch in your power cost and your hash rate. It'll tell you all you need then. I'd imagine power wise, an asic will always be efficient.  The real kicker will be calculating ROI on the purchase itself.

And here I was annoyed that I lost $20 ish by buying coin a couple days ago. 
My advice is this: is it worse to lose it all with the potential to MAYBE get it all back or more by holding? Or is it better to tell your family about your mistake and cut your losses. That depends on how important this money is to your families current situation and if people would be better off with a guaranteed half of it now instead of maybe none, maybe all later. 
Better yet, explain to them the current situation and take a vote assuming this is multiple people's money. If they all agreed to let you invest it, this is fair game and NOT YOUR FAULT. Obviously not every investment plays out.  Again, back to my first point, if sharing this info will ruin relationships and break all hell loose, do you think you'll be better off letting it play out by holding?  
People can get pretty irrational about money (understandably), so this really depends on your family and relationship dynamics. Don't beat yourself up over this. You can't possibly know how markets will go, especially crypto markets. Hindsight is always 20-20, and we always feel so confidant and sure when clicking buy.

thanks, I understand it now.  I have my wallet .dats (which are all encrypted within the wallets) saved to a rar5 which is also encrypted with a separate password and backed up in a few secure locations.  I never forget passwords, so I'm not concerned at all on that note, I'm just curious say, *knock on wood* something happens to me and I'm dead or unable to remember any passwords, how can I find a way to make sure my family can access my wallets, but not have their security greatly compromised.  Pretty much all of my immediate family constantly abuses the "i forgot my password" button... haha.
That's a worry for a later day though, at the moment my portfolio of wallets isn't worth much.

I sold at 318 the other night thinking I'd buy back in when it hits 290 ish. I'd have been right on the money too, but I forgot while coinbase has its own wallet, it doesn't hold fiat. Now I'm waiting on my bank. Fortunately this was only half a BTC of my hot coins, not my big wallet. 
Don't drink and trade, folks. 
While I'm here, what is the USD/BTC exchange of choice for americans? I normally trade in alts and just buy BTC when I need it, but obviously if I want to trade BTC to USD I need to find a real exchange for it.

I bet even more of them can't admit their own mistakes and failures.  I'd imagine most of the types that control their own coins don't have enough money that they could risk losing them, and the ones that lost their coins are used to just having people manage shit for them and paying whatever fees it incurs.  Supporting regulation and laws helps their ego avoid the blame.
I mean it's a lot of assumption and ultimately it doesn't even really matter, but most of the people I've met that are well off financially like that have the ego to go with it too (even if not in personal life, absolutely in their financial life, that's their entire source of ego and pride).
People rarely make sound decisions when the sting of loss is still present.

You can buy as little as .00000001 BTC.

Yeah, this is an option, but personally I strongly prefer cryptips.org. You are directly tipped to your address for whatever coins you choose to accept (they add more very frequently), and it also integrates with streamlabs for proper pop up alerts anyway. 
I'm also from Hawaii where I can't currently have a coinbase account anyway due to crappy local laws ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
Then again, more options are always good. This allows streamers that don't know anything about crypto or wallets to easily accept coins and be able to cash out too (since most people who don't really know or care about crypto just see it as an ends for fiat).

Obviously you'll at some point from buying to trading them have them outside of your own fully controlled wallet. That's a given. 
They're saying to keep that to the minimum possible level. Chances are the person he was replying to waited too long to try to move their coins. That or they're just new to crypto and had created the account and bought before it would have even been possible for them to be verified and all in time. 
Unless it was the latter though it was simply a matter of the person procrastinating on taking proper ownership of their coins. Hopefully it's resolved properly but for any of us in crypto we've seen plenty of stories time and time again that only prove **if you're not in control of your private keys they're not actually your coins.**

Well the problem with your logic is, strong encryption already exists and isn't difficult at all to use if you're actively looking to do so. They can't uncreate that, so at this point anyone who wants to use strong encryption for illegal activities can, and there is literally nothing anyone can do about it. Therefore, lawful citizens are giving up privacy for nothing. 
Moreover, companies and government agencies have been proven again and again to be irresponsible with our data at times, and in many regions, people have little faith in the good will of their government, especially with law enforcement. 
If they didn't want encryption to exist and become widespread, they shouldn't have given the people a reason to demand and desire it. 
The cats out of the bag on this one and they're going to have to learn how to manage in a post encryption society. Again, any serious criminals will be using anonymity and encryption services already, and sure as fuck won't stop when it's illegal. There are plenty of decentralized options available, so "shutting it down" isn't even remotely feasible. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:41:34
Only shitty thing when we're talking about small transactions is the current fee levels.  Best case scenario you're paying the fee twice (once for the burger, once when you buy BTC again). If you're moving it around at all beyond that then even more so. 
I've also noticed that things like bitpay, etc, tend to really inflate the usd:btc rates in a way that at very unfavorable for the customer. For example a $22 steam game with bitpays rate and the tx fee was going to be just shy of $27 worth of BTC.  I just ended up using PayPal.

You can break btc down to 0.00000001 (someone correct me on the exact decimal place if I'm wrong please).
People see the price per coin and it feels weird. 
0.01 would be about $6.50 or something currently. 
If your phone or whatever wallet device you used had .3 BTC in it and you spent 0.01 on lunch, suddenly things start to make a lot more sense. 
If this isn't the angle you're going for here, please elaborate. I'd be happy to entertain a discussion, and I'm not opposed to being proven wrong if you're finding a fallacy elsewhere.
