Not surprised. Ver and Wu and his other corrupt buddies are masters at market manipulation. No doubt his pool and Antpool intend to support 2X so they can starve BTC of hashpower and slow it down to crawl. Then when BTC is weakened drop B2X like a rock and start supporting BCH. Preparations have been underway for a while now. Bithumb pump (like last time) suck people into that and then remove the EDA at the most opportune time. I hope their BS backfires and BCH burns big time. They deserve it. BCH may have Satoshi's code, but not his vision.

B2X is dead no matter what happens

Well said.

But if BCH does attack they will prop up B2X only long enough to slow BTC  transactions to a crawl and create panic. Then they will drop B2X, its value will dwindle rapidly and the new B2X coins wont be worth much.

I wonder just how much of the Korean exchange support is from the Koreans or miners allied to BCH?

They have the majority of hashpower on their side. They have dropped EDA. The coins being pumped. They are getting ready, surely the core developers know about this.

and the problem is?

Bitcoin did win. But this time BCH has the timing right and it has some formidable weapons at its disposal.

Ok, I'll bring the fortune cookies maybe they can tell us what core have up their sleeve as a counter move.

Done, yes thats the scenario I see playing out more or less.
