@_date: 2014-12-03 19:13:58
I give time inbetween each tip, to make it even better, I will give a 10 second minimum notice before I am posting the next tip, like right now..  next tip in 10 seconds...

That was super kind of you, thanks! I will make another video this week and I will spend more so will have plenty more food to give. IF anyone has suggestions on what I should get besides burgers (the first thing that came to mind) then please let me know here in comments. I think I am here to stay a while on Reddit :)
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:20:57
I am in the mood to throw around even more Bitcoin to whoever is quick enough to scoop it up, any takers at this hour?

@_date: 2014-11-30 01:53:05
Understood, this is just innovation of sorts, I am just trying to do something new that could gain more mainstream exposure, changetip is getting some good hype and press with that demographic already
@_date: 2014-11-18 22:08:12
This is why I love the Internet and bitcoin so much :)
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:57:44

Take it easy... 
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:07:59
I have about 13 minutes till I have to leave here, so here comes some more!
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:13:23
I often question how some individuals can be so selfish minded.. I was talking with a group of people today over coffee and one 'bitcoin enthusiast" would not stop complaining to me that I should only buy food and drink for the homeless from stores that truly accept bitcoin, adding that I am doing it all wrong because I am paying a fee to use my bitcoin debit card each time I run it at a visa terminal...  
When I told him that each time I do a transaction with my bitcoin debit card, I am only charged 27 cents Canadian transaction fee, he still argued that I was not doing anything positive for the bitcoin community bla bla....
Then I brought up another very important counter argument to his saying that I should only get food and drink etc to give to the homeless from places that accept direct wallet to wallet bitcoin for payment... Here In Montreal The availability of such places is close to non existent and the ones that do, well be prepared to pay top dollar for whatever you buy.. I am more then fine having to pay twenty seven cents for the convenience of being able to spend the funds in my bitcoin wallet at any establishment that accepts visa cards.
Of course when I asked him how much he wanted to contribute to help expand my buying power for my next mission I will do on this Sunday Night and make a third video of it all as it happens...... He replied "I don't give coin away, the wealthy do not become wealthy because they gave away their money" Although I kind of expected something along those lines of a reply to come from him, I also know this is the same type of person who bought several miners from butterfly labs for a few hundred bucks a while ago based on clever marketing he fell for leading him to believe he would make profit in no time on a daily basis. The same type of person who ended up desperately trying to sell their minuscule mining rigs on ebay and classified sites after they woke up and realized that it would take years to make back the investment they put into them.
I am going to keep on using bitcoin to buy food, drink, supplies etc to give out to the huge homeless population we have here in Montreal and continue to film it each time and put it on Youtube since I have a lot of faith that it will eventually be a part of the reason more people out there show others in need, random acts of kindness given the opportunity to do so.
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:02:35
Ok I am back with TIP  Here you go guys! Who is gonna snag this one?
@_date: 2014-12-26 22:59:13
If you look at my post history here, you will see I did try reaching out on several occations before with no success, only the first time after my first video was there a nice bunch of people on reddit that contributed to make the second video so much more awesome, with more btc for more goods for the homeless, every penny of which was used on them, plus some of my own again. But after the second video was published , people lost interest here it was clear, so I did not want to appear pesky so I stopped posting about it. Now that I got media attention, perhaps that changes everything if i could get enough support to get them those sleeping bags and more food and coffee, that would be so incredible, time will tell, I just am unsure about posting another thread for support after my last few got almost ignored.
@_date: 2014-12-02 22:05:02
You are welcome, and yes its Dude hehe.
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:13:10
bah, I know it was not the brightest on my part, however I have been using twitter since 2007 and when I reply, I click reply and write and post. I see by searching that I am not alone here with this changetip situation, that many others here on reddit and twitter are posting similar occurrences, so either there are plenty of "dummies" out there or this changetip bot on twitter needs some tweaking....  Which one is it. either way, not the best for PR if you know what I mean... Time for me to get to work on a nice writeup about this indeed.
@_date: 2014-11-18 22:13:44
So what you are implying here is that I should not publish videos of what I am doing in an attempt to INSPIRE many others to get out and do the same? Well my response to that is..................
EXPECT DOZENS IF NOT MORE of videos I will record every single time from now till I die of me doing whatever I am able to do to help those in need. I plan on polluting the net with my random acts of kindness, If that bothers people, then good, I know I hit a nerve for all the right reasons.
@_date: 2014-11-18 10:02:09
I am dead tired, just finished editing and uploading the new video I made of what I did tonight, I will create a fresh new thread here in r/bitcoin about it just after I power nap a bit, Tonight was amazing, hope you guys like the footage from tonight, i will be up and on here in like 3-4 hours cause im seeing double right now from being so tired. Thanks to everyone. The vid link is 
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:17:45
Thanks a lot, yes, I am not here to break any rules, I simply needed a number to base my tip amounts on and I decided it would be a good one to choose the thread points as a random amount since it goes up and down quite fast!
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:35:09
You are welcome Cam, glad you got one of them!

Right? I knew that I had to fill that void cause it is as if nobody in the scene realizes how many mainstream they are pushing away with all the crypto nerd shit. We need those ppl to embrace bitcoin not fear it.

Changetip is awesome, I learned about if here just earlier this week due to a lot of redditors and people viewing my videos on Youtbe sending me tips with it. Great service and very quick and easy transactions.
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:15:57
Thanks murbul, your kindness is cool as hell, totally not a setup, but definitely something I am determined to draw plenty of attention to. I see that this has happened to plenty of people, who I am reaching out to one by one right now to get things moving on this....
@_date: 2014-11-22 14:47:17
I am happy to wake up to this really nice article they published on their site. I Am gearing up now for my third time going out to do this, but this time aiming at making it more epic then the first two times! Feeding the homeless with food and drink that I paid for with bitcoin has now officially become a good habit for me.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:08:22
Get ready here it comes....
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:05:46
This is rather frustrating, I want to use the system to continue to mass tip and I can't. Not cool. Oh well, I guess I will look for another platform to use to do this in a simple and similar fashion without the cock blocks. Sorry guys but this is out of my hands. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:53:17
ok good :)  The interview was smooth, about my feeding the homeless with bitcoin runs that I have been doing, second interview for local media in the past week, so it is poised to get some great exposure for sure.

Hmm I did not get it for some reason, same with one below
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:44:41
I will I am not going to stop anytime soon that is for sure. I bet the authorities will figure out some law to use against my actions soon enough, but that will even make it more of a rush for me then it already is!

I will throw some more Magicurl's out there if anyone is still awake, show some hands!
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:05:20
Just for those who do not understand, it is really easy, I am giving away bitcoin to 30 people. I use a feature in Changetip where I set an ammount to tip and it generates a unique url that I give to the person I want to have the bitcoin. Once someone clicks that url, the BTC is collected and you can do as you wish with it! Even if you do not have a Changetip account, the page you see when you click one of my links will tell you how to get an account and enjoy your BTC I gave to you.
If you are not quick on the draw, someone else will click the links as I post them and they will collect the bitcoin that I am giving out.
Ok, it is time to start.... here is the first tip, comment back whoever collects it and how much you got! 
TIP # 1  
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:19:03
In this thread and the others I made doing the same, you will clearly see people that are new to changetip and thankful for this fun way of creating awareness of it's functionality to them. It's not simply about bitcoin itself. Getting more people into the "tipping" mode is the name of the game.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:56:36
Ok guys I see you now in here.. so I was wrong, so as promised, here comes 5 Changetip MagicUrl's back to back so F5 QUICK till your fingers bleed....

@_date: 2014-11-26 00:26:17
I am feeling the same vibe right now, If we can enjoy a beer or glass of wine, why not spread that joy around. When it comes to drinking in public and getting arrested for it, the chance that happens is a big 0 due to the fact that the authorities make it real clear that their holding cells are not hotels and whenever the local homeless act up in an effort to get a good night's sleep in a warm detention cell, they cops ignore those efforts and look the other way. Win win situation.

@_date: 2014-12-26 12:46:33
Thanks, I have some ideas lined up for my next videos, one example being, I'm unable to afford it now but soon I want to buy like 50 sleeping bags (there is a local company liquidating them for $10 a piece here) and go hand them out with more food and hot coffee. These people could really benefit from a clean sleeping bag along with the other stuff.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:25:26
The thing about the debit card I use that sets it apart from the other ones out there is that it is directly linked to my btc wallet balance. So whatever I have in my BTC balance, I am able to use without going through the process of converting, or sending funds to the card after they convert to usd. I was waiting for a long time for this type of convenience and now that I have it, I want to do things with bitcoin that have not been done before and show the skeptics and people who think btc is all about crime money, show them all that bitcoin can and will be used for GOOD! 
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:59:03
Please read the post, I do not send to wallets, I make urls where the first person to click the url (changetip url) auto collects the tip I attached to it, then you can deposit it to your wallet or wherever you want.

Back guys, Got pulled over by the local cops, wasted 25 minutes or more of my time while they drilled me about my light being off, its just a ballast issue, it sometimes does not go on then I flip the switch and it works, but this cop was itching to give me a hard time.... Anyways I am back, no ticket, talked my way out of that one by telling the cop all about DashCam's and how he needs one in his cruiser....
Let the tipping begin, i am generating a whack of links right now
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:25:34

Just a free changetip account and you can enjoy the bitcoin I am giving out.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:40:16
Definite, in time for sure, I think for now, the best way to appeal to the masses is to simply give out free money with no strings attached, that appeals to the masses 100% More and more people watching will jump on board and will get involved with bitcoin, lurkers will start posting and taking part as well.
@_date: 2014-12-09 23:07:30
Thank you for your kindness! I just logged into my Changetip and it says "error" on your tip saying insufficient funds, do you see an error on your end too?

Seeing as how people seem to like the thread and it shows in the upvotes now being 5, I will now give out this TIP  worth 5 cents usd in bitcoin!

This type of mainstream media coverage goes a long way, I had at least 100 people approached me in yesterday and today about the story, asking me about bitcoin, when I told many of them how easy bitcoin is to obtain, use and manage, they were very happy to learn and ready to get involved. I have a very friendly way of explaining things so that the mainstream can understand and grasp what I am telling them.

I regularly go out and feed the homeless with food bought with bitcoin and post it to youtube each time I do. I have been featured in the local mainstream media too for it as well. Every little bit helps. Here is one of the videos 
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:24:31
I have 4 more random tips to give out here, but..... Since I see all the people who are trying hard to ruin the popularity of this thread by Downvoting it... You have inspired me to just make another WHACK of random tip urls and keep the thread going non STOP for a good while. 
What do you guys have to say to that?
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:11:53
Oh hell, I can't stop giving out bitcoin, here is TIP

The difference when there is actually one, could be calculated every 24 hours for example and then could be put into an account used only for legitimate charity or educative efforts. The idea is just off the top of my head, I wanted some input and suggestions on how it could be improved.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:07:53

@_date: 2014-11-20 18:12:44
If you do, avoid their new Mighty Angus with jalapenos. I sneaked one yesterday when I was running all over town for work and nearly gagged. The worst thing on their menu for sure.

I am Going to head into downtown in a few hours again this time I will use the money that I got from here in the changetip's that were sent to me so far along with some of my own bitcoin as well to buy food and feed a bunch of people tonight here in Downtown Montreal. It's snowing outside, cold and slippery everywhere, accidents on the roads but none of that will stop me, as I know there are plenty of people who do not have a car or a roof over their heads tonight who will be very happy to see me while I drive around town with a bag or two of hot food for them to eat and coffee for them to drink. The Tim hortons here sells a big container of coffee (designed to bring to the office, has 10 cups of coffee in it with a spout to pour it) I will get that as well and turn my car into a moving cafeteria lol. I will upload the video as soon as I get back home for all of you to see.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:07:07
yessir, instant and quick free bitcoin from my balance!
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:49:39
If you are in Canada, you can do like I have done, I too am in Canada. I got a XAPO.com wallet, ordered their card (free) it is a debit card that connects to your xapo btc wallet so that you can access your bitcoin to use it in any store, or anywhere that accepts Visa cards, including ATM's world wide for btc to instant cash withdraw with no wait times, it is the only card/btc wallet of it's type and it is not available to Americans, however you can recieve payments in btc to it from anyone in any country.
It is a great way to manage and have access to your bitcoin, for myself at least.
@_date: 2014-11-17 03:51:33

I do not want to break any rules, but curious as to if I would need to post this video in the main Reddit (not this subreddit) to get more people's input, or do threads (posts) go there eventually based on the level of interaction they get? Thanks in advance for the answer.

Here is another, TIP # 7
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:57:09
Happy birthday to me, all I did was thank the person for sending me a changetip of 39 cents for my birthday, so cool that he sent me something before any friends, then Changetip sent him $2.50 from my wallet back, then when I replied and questioned what happened, another $2.50 was sent from my wallet to his.... I am scared to even look at my tweet, how much will I lose the third time??  Happy  Shitty birthday to me!

well it is not legal to exchange cash for sexual services, for company it is legal but not cash for sex as an open transaction. So... Bitcoin for pussy or blowjobs would work and be completely legal to openly solicit and promote without using clever wording to beat around the bush. Pun intended.

Oh totally right about them avoiding the spicy stuff, there is a big market for hot sauces here yet the fast food spots refuse to go down that road, it's always been like that here. Too bad really, sometimes you just do not want to sit down at a specialty resto to have something super HOT

not getting the tip for some reason
@_date: 2014-12-26 03:36:47
Sorry bout that it is in French, I live in Montreal, Canada and that is North America's  French Language daily paper, with 550k readers daily average, mainly here in the city of Montreal.
The Title basically says "He gave $220 to the homeless thanks to his bitcoins"
Then it explains how I wanted to do somethings special with bitcoin, so when I got my hands on my Xapo Bitcoin debit card, I went out right away and used the $20 I had on it to buy a bag of burgers at Mcdonalds, pay with bitcoin using the debitcard then cross the street to the big church where homeless people sleep and handed out the food to them. I filmed it and put it on youtube, with the hopes to show people how easy it is to use bitcoin, spend bitcoin and be kind to others with next to nothing!
The video got very popular with viewers and I did a second and a third  video, but those times getting a LOT more food and coffee with bitcoin and giving it out to a lot more homeless people. Basically the media here jumped on it and contacted me by email and asked to meet me to write about it.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:56:40

Hey Reddit, as promised here is my video I made last night, I got two bags of burgers this time (30 doubles) and a couple Gallons of Coffee, sugar, milk cream etc, paid for it all With Bitcoin on my bitcoin debit card and handed it out to a large group of homeless people here in Montreal, Canada. Your guys help allowed me to get so much more this time for them all and I am ready to do it again over and over, since helping those in need is really very important to me and showing the world the power of using bitcoin for something so positive is a message that I am passionate about as well!
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:34:49
very kind of you, I will keep an eye on it on my end, hope there is no bugs in the system. 3rd time that happened today

Ya like here there are 1k ppl avarage watching the subreddit live, where else can I do this that there are more people active that actually would know what to do with the btc, etc.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:58:27
Hell yes, I like the idea, I could do that, go to the market, look at the fliers for the best specials, and get a lot of stuff, prep it then load it in my truck and go out and hand it out to the people and just keep making new videos and uploading them showing that it was all made possible by using bitcoin and the community here of course. As for transparancy, it should be pretty straight forward a way that I keep track of what contributions come from the community for the cause and spend those funds on it, maybe I could open a separate wallet just for that purpose even and then people could see what is coming in and out through blockchain. Sorry I am rambling on here im just so happy to see people are liking what I did and I have been getting some emails today about it as well, Imagine the media jumps on this, then things could get to a whole other level! Christmas could be very very happy for the people here in Montreal in need and if I was a driving force behind that, WOW.

Big thanks, your kindness will be used for the next video, I am doing this again on Thursday or Friday, I am hoping that every single time I do this and put it out there for the world to see, I will change many people's negative perception of bitcoin all the while inspiring others to do random acts of kindness to those in need. Some say I dream too much but how can it hurt to try like this and stay determined.

if you took a second to look at my posts I made on reddit showing videos  I made this week of me buying food and coffee and paying for it with my bitcoin debit card, then giving it to homeless people, you would see that a large number of redditors sent me changetip within a 2 day span, to the tune of $60 which took every bit of it to go back out and do it again.
This time buying about $100 worth of food and gallons of hot coffee then going to a cold dark park/underpass in downtown to give it all to about 20 homeless people huddled up there, sat with them, talked about things including how bitcoin paid for all the goods and that the kind hearts from reddit and others from Youtube had chipped in, in a big way... Then I posted that video as well to reddit to keep they cycle going. 
Perhaps you are too busy insulting people here to even click on my name to see the threads I posted and what happened in them so I will leave them here for you to make reference.

This is not the situation with the retailers I am getting on board to accept bitcoin. They will provice the same exchange policy to people that pay with bitcoin as they do with anyone who pays with credit card or cash, nothing changes. I always tell people to use caution when buying online with bitcoin and to use merchants that offer full exchange policies an d are very established as well.  I have all this covered already.
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:26:22
I am curious as to why the twitter changetip account/bot automated actions were not carefully adapted to the way twitter functions when replying. The @ Changetip account on twitter seems to not be only a bot, but an account administered by someone who does actually make tweets and engage in other things besides granting tips. I did send a message to the gentlemen who sent me 39 cents for my bday to tell him what happened and that my account had sent him $5.00 back am still waiting for a reply from him. :(
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:34:29

@_date: 2014-12-09 22:14:51
Ok, Enough babble, time to drop the bomb in here, feel free to send some healthy changetip's @ me after reading my knoldge drop.  Thx.
I just came across this thead and seen a lot of the sock puppet claims being shot around again about Changetip. They are an awesome service, a huge part of the mix that allowed me to get a lot of support for the videos I make when I go out and feed homeless people with food and drinks I pay for with Bitcoin, overall they are an amazing tool that has helped myself as well as helping others with legitimate and great causes.
Besides being someone with a good heart who cares for the well being of those who are in need, I am someone who is very skilled in the private investigation field and can gather information on anyone or anything in a very effective manner. 
The whole sockpuppet refrence being tossed around in here and other threads that are similar, most bashing Changetip, it is clear that nobody took a few moments to dig up info to justify their claims/accusations. I will lay out some things to clear the air here.... 
It is no secret that Changetip has a team of "paid tippers" on reddit, twitter, etc. Yes, a team of tippers who are paid to throw tips around and draw attention in an effort to make things go viral. All you need to do to know that is look at the job postings they put up that spell it out in black and white, here are some snippits from one Job offering:
"Manage a small team of paid tippers."
"Creative Viral Campaigns:
Conceive and execute campaigns that use ChangeTip for good, and have it spread virally. Example:  with  for payment"
"Figure out how to get maximum exposure for ChangeTip on existing channels, such as tipping high exposure videos on YouTube, celebrities on Twitter, popular blogs on Tumblr, or popular content on Reddit."
 Compensation:
$75K – $115K Salary
0.25% – 1.0% Equity

But basically I was just telling them that the food was paid for with Bitcoin and they were super grateful, it made my night I wanted to do something totally unique with Bitcoin and this seemed to be my best bet.

I know a general argument is that they sell similar products on ebay/chinese wholesale sites where the price is much lower, this is great if looking to buy and not care ever about defects,shipping delays,impossible returns etc. Or get the product from a specialist and pay the extra for the service and support and get it shipped to you from within north america, that is a choice that the consumer has.
@_date: 2014-12-03 03:38:07

I have a debit card from Xapo that I can use in any store that accepts Visa cards. It instantly deducts the money for what I am buying from my Bitcoin Wallet, instantly converting it into USD or CAD, euro, etc, right on the spot to pay for the goods. 
Unlike other btc debit card solutions where you have to login and initiate a transfer to the card from your bitcoin wallet beforehand, in most cases wait a period of time for the money to be available, then use it. I like the power of being able to use my bitcoin wallet balance to buy whatever I want, wherever I choose, with no limits!
Also, if I need to convert my bitcoin into cash quickly, i simply go to any ATM and pop the card in and withdraw cash instantly as well.
@_date: 2014-11-18 22:17:25
It's the only bitcoin debit card system of it's kind from what I researched. The bitcoin wallet is with XAPO and the debit card uses the balance in your XAPO btc wallet instantly each time you use the card, so there is no steps to transfer your btc to usd then to a card, or anything for that matter to do so you can access your funds for use in any business that accepts VISA. It is hands down, one of the best things I got my hands on as of late. One small issue though is they do not send cards to Americans, some issues with laws that I am uncertain of.

Wrong, that would be against the rules, I am simply basing how much I CHOOSE to give to people on the number of votes that they voluntarily submit based on how they like my post content. This is very clear on my part and I made sure to put that clearly in my post as well.
I could choose the amounts I give out based on anything I want, I just choose to do them based on those numbers, it makes things easy.

I believe firmly in giving to others, especially those in need. Locally I have been featured in the news for feeding the homeless with bitcoin, the only real positive mainstream media coverage when it comes to bitcoin in general here. I am on a mission with bitcoin and that is to generate a massive buzz within the mainstream, pushing them to adopt bitcoin and embrace it to use on a regular basis including the merchants that I consult as well on how to accept btc in their local businesses. I am a one man army for now and even if it stays that way I am here for the long run.

If this guy wants to prove a point, then good luck to him. Someone who has time on their hands is going to D0X him using the plethora of information linked to him reflecting his lifestyle, likes, dislikes, personal and geographical details etc found if you just take time to comb through his online history such as the following two sites 
That along with historical whois lookups on all his domains, he has plenty, someone determined can get real up close and personal and social the details right out of him, slap a silent logger on him etc etc....
I personally would not budge for the barely $3000 payout, had it been 30k and the same circumstances, I would dedicate some effort to showing this cat what time it is.

Oh, yes a little far, however, go check your local kijiji and search for the term bitcoin, chances you will find local sellers who will accommodate you for unlimited amounts at a negotiable point rate. They will meet you in person anywhere of your choice, a Tim hortons for example where you can do the cash to btc transaction in person. It's the best and quickest solution I can think of right now for you so far out.

@_date: 2015-01-01 02:07:41
This is me, throwing random amounts of bitcoin out there in the form of Tip.Me urls, if you don't know what that is, it's simple.
Changetip.com has a feature where any user can send a url to someone and attach any amount of bitcoin to it, when someone clicks the url, it instantly lets you collect the bitcoin attached to it. 
It is a simple way to send money to people without then having to go through 20 steps to collect it.
I see people make a huge chaos to get 50 bits in some of these posts, here i am handing out at least a dime to actual dollars per tip and people do not seem to care to grab the free money...
Wierd indeed.

I reached out directly to Victoria over at changetip about the new limits imposed and she was very helpful, in my situation I never know how many tips I stand to get in a day, there have been days that passed the $25 mark up to now and many days of $0. 
She was a big help and I got my account all in order now, try emailing her directly to discuss your particular needs as well, her email is victoria

Well, three people commented since I posted my last one, so I am out for the night, it was fun, but everyone seems too busy chasing after bits and not too interested in the dollars I am throwing around and that is fine. Happy New Year to all.

How so? I am giving my bitcoin to people no matter what. In your example the person would only get money if they performed an action of washing the car.
Big difference.

I will post a bunch more tips for you guys to scoop up if you are not too busy elseware and have some time to collect bitcoin that I am throwing around. We'll see but I am not waiting around too long to give money away, so let's get on the ball here people.

This is funny, I wonder if they realize that if you put an end to using bitcoin for illicit business, bitcoin would dwindle down to near nothing.

12 teams , minimum must deposit 0.85 cents usd worth of BTC for each bet to be allowed to submit all 12 teams to the contest and assure your win. Use a different IP for each account and clear cookies (can use vm's or home connect with 12 different socks). Total investment needed to guarantee that you win a share of the 20 BTC is only $10 usd.
Then you can scale it up and repeat the above several times so you end up collecting plenty more.
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:39:29
let's just say that I have done it several times and the numbers/security if great and users feel comfortable as well that they need to go into a secure location to do their transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:14:52
They work like a charm. I personally have been doing "live bitcoin ponzi's" on periscope and people throw their btc my way for a chance to double it and beat the clock or lose it. Greed will always overpower risk in the minds of the masses.

Your best bet is just go to any established Jewlery Store in the downtown core, offer the owner 2%of all transacts. Tell him you will bring him your customers in from your own publicity which will benefit him. Deal usually closes within 30 mins and a coffee or 2.

I personally use  to buy btc quickly with credit cards, even prepaid cards, greendot, gift cards they all work and they even accept cash through worldwide ria moneytransfer stores. Quickest turnaround time and no crazy long approval forms to fill out.

Here is another video showing the same method I used, works for me every time to double or more my bitcoin. Since sharing the method last night, people have tweeted about winning many BTC by using it at  
Proof Video 
Tweets from winners who used the method since I made it public last night, more videos on the way, I encourage people to screen record their action and share it as well so many people can bank with this while it lasts.
  &lt;--- Made $1380 usd in minutes!
 &lt;---- Made 8 more Bitcoin! $3000 USD
 &lt;---- Made $110 USD profit in BTC
 &lt;--- Made $265 USD in BTC!

Excellent review!!

It simply gives you the ability to instantly spend btc anywhere that accepts visa, without delays like other debit cards that you have to transfer btc to them then wait a long period of time for it to clear to be able to use it. Also, if you need to instantly convert your bitcoin into paper cash, you just can send btc to your xapo hotwallet then go to an atm and take out up to $2000 usd per day cash.

Their sec guys are on top of their game and the issue was patched shortly after I interacted with them via email and shared links to my post here and on twiter, before I could even make a POC video to show them  it in action. They surely combed the logs and seen my numerous attempts to manipulate the url strings and as a result pinpointed what they were looking for.  Good on them
Here is a video I just made explaining the whole endeavour.

Here is a list of just a few things that can be done with this vulnerability :
1) Easily fool most people who will click it since it clearly is a link to bitcoin.com then when the page opens, it is a phishing site where you are prompted to enter your login credentials to your bitcoin wallets elseware
2) Easily use it to send people to a page that is a copy of bitcoin.com's legit homepage and riddle it with links to download trojan wallets, key loggers or whatever. Since the link they are clicking is clearly a bitcoin.com link. Newbs Rekt on a large scale.....
3) Bypass spam filters and send out a mass email blast to known bitcoin wallet users, prompting them to click the link to get some kind of reward/freebie, free coin whatever.. Why would anyone not click the link, it's clearly an official bitcoin.com link.
More possible uses, too many to list.
Curious to know if there is a bounty for this from whoever operates Bitcoin.com
Comments appreciated.
