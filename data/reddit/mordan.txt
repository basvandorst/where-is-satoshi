it's like that. Both USD and BTC were lost in the MtGox Hack.
@_date: 2016-08-13 08:16:31
I use BTC like digital Gold. Small transactions will be done off chain anyways. Anyone with some brain power can see that. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:49:10
me too. anyone expect risky traders should NEVER let Fiat/BTC on any exchanges. Buy and Hold.

how does it work.. can you explain how I send Euros from my bank account to buy Bitcoins? The video on bitsquares front page doesn't explain anything!!!

i bought a few pascal. same Bitcoin distribution.. they have a 100 blocks chain. they delete everything before. They do that because they have accounts that you need to buy. chain is bounded by the accounts. i love bitcoin 90% of my networth but Pascal is so business friendly with its windows application.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:58:51
they are betting on Bitcoin Cash.. that's why.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:32:16

interesting. so NEM does not have decentralized miners?
how does black listing work?
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:56:09
if POS and DPOS design fail to be censorship resistant...
POW will lead to a single coin owning all the energy on earth and all sidechains will be secured by it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:04:29
don't underestimate all the shills who market alt coins as superior in order to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:10:19
i think we need a kind of seed that derives all keys.
but that seed should need another file that you have to store somewhere on the cloud.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:17:44
i don't trust bitpay after the bch fiasco.
they showed how bad business people they were.

don't use twitter. use steemit
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:17:09
what about Nano Ledger master seed?
Monero seed? Nearly all new coins simply have a master seed.
my point being. if someone gets his hands on the seed. game over. I hate seeds.
if someone sees my seed. game over. if someone sees my typing my password on bitcoin core.. he still needs the wallet file.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:41:09
Bitcoin is resilient. have you seen the price stability?
Coinbase is going to get fucked. They are morons. 
What would I do? I would suck it up and merge all the UTXOs.
Bitstamp does it like a champ and I pay lower trading fees, zero fiat deposit fees and I pay ZERO Fees to withdraw BTC.
FUCK COINBASE. Free market in action.

Pascal Coin ;) only coin written with Pascal and Delphi. Wallet looks ugly
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:05:41
Bitcoin is censorship resistant.
Ethereum might be fast. but so will be bank wires after they use blockchains as back ends.
so what then? Only Bitcoin will have 20 years of history and a synchable blockchain by anyone.
Try synching ethereum chain today lol. you will have a rude awekening.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:27:58
yea he did. but that does not mean everything he says is stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:46:04
security coupled with decentralization.
which is why Bitcoin is valuable.
Bitcoin is battled tested and its surface of attack is much smaller than say Ethereum

the same could be said of MtGox in 2013.. they had a monopoly and making a killing with fees.
and yet they went bankrupt due to incompetence.
Coinbase is run by an incompetent CEO. a true idiot moron.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:57:26
i don't like seed wallets. there is only one factor. the seed (i.e. password)
encrypted wallet files have 2 layers. you need the wallet file and you need the password.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:15:39
that's why you need small blocks. with big blocks you are entirely at the mercy of companies like Ledger.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:17:30
yes started using livecoinwatch today as well.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:45:49
well then I will use crypto dollars or XRP. it is just as decentralized as it needs to be.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:31:40
trading is bad. hodling is good.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:58:10
also my view about POW. Energy cannot be faked. Bitcoin Layer 0 is what matters. 
Time will tell if POS and DPOS coins can be censorship resistant long term.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:02:30
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:52:32
Moreover... centralization at layer 2 is not so big of a deal .. as long as you have back up solution on layer 1 when you REALLY need censorship resistant payments.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:51:56
compare Pascal and Digibyte.
how does DGB deals with uncles ... 15 seconds block is so dumb.

ICOs are illegal.
the regulatory risk is huge with ICOs.. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:01:50
lol...how ironic.. buy bitcoin back... so even you agree Bitcoin is the standard.... increase your BTC stash.. everyone values alt in satoshis or bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:46:57
Coinbase is a complete moron
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:49:39
you don't understand the concept of proof of work.
POW is one reason why Bitcoin will be alone and all alts dead when and if Bitcoin scales.
Energy consumption cannot be faked. That's the only way to trust untruthful 3rd parties.
All ALTs can be attacked with more energy. That's why new alts are using premined token like Ripple. But POS and DPOS have their own issue. POS and DPOS can be slowly bought out by big fishes who have an incentive to control or kill the POS network. They don't have to spend energy. They just have to print fiat to buy the tokens.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:47:54
man.. i agree but some alt coins are still valuable. 
Monero for instance. I am loaded on Bitcoin and Monero (privacy) and Bitshares (dex and tether killer).
Also check out Pascal coin. Best coin design ever. 100tx/sec on a blockchain not a DAG like iota.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:17:58
pretty neat indeed

@_date: 2018-01-11 10:45:56
Eth? It is a platform for funding ICOs.
Have you tried to start up an Eth from scratch? Imagine the Eth network is being attacked and you cannot trust any data you get.

if everyone starts to use bitcoin as a saving account.. buying some satoshis every month DCA style...
yes its inevitable.
@_date: 2019-07-03 09:28:03
a new kind of 'volatile' saving account.
ask those who hodl since 2015 and cash out some fiat when they need it
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:17:09
i started using this one.
is it any good?
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:06:42
i am pro bitcoin unfortunately I can see Eth reaching parity.
To the noobs i talk too... they keep repeating the narrative Bitcoin is old tech.
They understand shit about blockchain. None of them understand censorship resistance.
They hear smart contracts. They buy.
Eth has a big thing going for it. ICOs. It is a money making machine for scammer and legit projects. So there is a huge buy pressure as long as more ICOs are created than ICOs selling their Eth for dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:28:47
Use pascal coin. They solved scaling elegantly. Better design than any other coin i know of.
Why are you shilling for bigger blocks here? Waste of time.

I don't understand. you can already choose between hundreds of cryptos.
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:18:11
agreed. except you got it wrong at one point.
in a future BTC economy, when you want to take some debt, you create a token out of thin air.
Debt will be tokenized. That's my intuition. I don't know the details yet.
you want to buy a house, you will go to the BuilderTokenChain... they will do the job of the current bankers. As long as you haven't paid back your tokens, your house is not yours and belongs to them.
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:38:20
the tokens are backed by the house. 
I am not saying i have it all figured it out. I am a dev, not an economist. But that's my intuition.

no. it has marginal value for gas. i bought some to try out contracts. I don't like it. You have to pay outrageous gas costs.. For a user its impossible to predict how much a contract really costs.
the chain is bloated and huge. I cannot sync it on my computer.. so it never will be a decentralized store of value.

no... 
he has always used the media to his advantage.
I am pretty sure he read and tweaked the tweet, but didn't write it.
he is also low key invested in it. It was a 3D chess move a few hours after Powell said Bitcoin was digital gold.
This tweet achieves many things for Trump. It boosts Bitcoin's profile while on the surface he seems like defending the dollar. He pleases the bankers. He forces CNN and liberals to talk about Bitcoin and why should they dislike something that Trump also dislikes.
@_date: 2019-07-16 08:37:44

best option is to learn how to use a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor.

manipulation is harder if you move your coins off exchanges. you remove a key information to them. how much you own and your trade history.

@_date: 2017-12-05 22:54:28
i agree. This year i have convinced 10 people to buy.. august, november, 5 more this month.
but i fuck with fudders on reddit. You got to defend yourself. Shills are working for big whales to make people sell. How many people panic sold to lose everything?

don't fucking worry about the damn price.
it means you are investing money you are not willing to lose. Sell and don't come but don't complain when Bitcoin is 40k in 2 years after a dip to 5k

i agree. I hodl BTC
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:35:43
greed because you took the risk to enter your ledger seed on a compromised computer in a fucking 3rd party wallet...
something I would never do.
of course Core can be compromised... but its harder. its also a reason why i never update like all the stupid fools who update to the latest as soon as possible. (Windows update is a virus in itself,, they can sneak anything and fuck everyone)
I also have some BTC on a ledger. I accept the fact I cannot move them out unless I am near it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:52:50
ok good then :)
was worried for a second.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:02:32
i am not angry. i like teaching noobs the hard way. smack on their face. Noobs should not trade. HODL and Buy DIPS. that's how it works with Bitcoin. You lost money by trading.

The risk/reward ratio is so low. 1 million USD per coin is a real possibility.

the moon is crypto in closed loop. BANKERS REKTED. NO MORE FIAT NEEDED.
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:02:42
thx ! please remind me. Monero is UTXO based?
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:09:56
great news... like the application a lot..
just that exchanges with fiat and bank transfers aren't really fun and safe.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:18:55
that's very good. it means nobody will be able to 51% attack. Bitcoin will have created a moon civilization by then
POS coins won't work. No work protect the chain and stakers can collude to change whatever they want. NYA kind of bullshit
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:59:58
so ETH will indeed be oil and not a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:18:58
but for Bitcoin to moon, you need people to start using it.
So you should grow some balls and tell people about it. Don't reveal what you have.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:43:05
Also my take. Better ride it up for now. Maybe short at 40k
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:26:38
mistake. you used good money to pay back back money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:36:16

taking profits is trading.. don't be fooled.
i remember the exact same advice back in May when a guy here wrote. TAKE PROFITS. PRICE IS 1300 USD.
Taking profits to miss the highs? HELL NO. If i had taken his advice I would have lost SOOO O FUCKING MUCH.

i never sold in 2013 from 1200 USD to 300 USD.

this is absolutely moronic from Brian Armstrong. as a shareholder I would ask his resignation.
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:09:44
the greed was because he wanted to sell and did not have access to his ledger... so his entered his seed on a compromised set up wanting to sell the top...
of course sell high... but safely. otherwise you lose everything.. which happened to OP. and this turns a sell high in a sell at VERY low... 0.

he can run one. can't he?
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:06:41
so your greed wanting to sell at the top of the bubble ...
NEVER use online wallets or anything other than core..
I wouldn't trust Electrum... maybe the binaries were compiled with a spy in it.. 
much easier than a generic key logger.
i only use Bitcoin Core and Nano Ledger.
anyways, glad you survived the ordeal.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:22:42

you are a useful idiot. People who invest in Bitcoin think Bitcoin and crypto in general will replace fiat in such a way that you can spend crypto anywhere and people won't need to cash out at all. closed loop.
that's our bet and if we are right we earn LOTS of money

i like Polo. Never had any issue with them.
but i understand the KYC is a weapon to take control of the funds of people like you who are from Russia, China and other far away countries or people who don't want to do the KYC because they are shady.
You are a noob who didn't withdraw his coins when he still could.
During that period i removed all my coins from POLO. I came back until after a while and did KYC.

Bitcoin is world reserve currency money. Bitcoin will win overall.

you still have to trust the earner to ship the goods to your physical address or not? Do they have to write it manually? Does Amazon accept so many different outgoing addresses?

Bit torrent has kept its unregulated conduit for file transfer.
I don't see why Bitcoin or another crypto will not. There are and will be regulations at fiat exchanges but that's it.
The good thing about Bitcoin is that if you do not want those anti-fraud measures, you can still transact totally independently from any bank. again just like cash.

man, that's bloody awesome.
that's not even the end of it. I'm working on a payment module with interesting features that would be impossible to do with the "legacy financial system". I'm so excited I can't sleep at times.
Bitcoin frees the unbanked..
And you can do this without circumventing the laws.
Doing things illegal can be done with cash or anything. Bitcoin does make life easier for some people.
After working on bitcoin for a while, I think the scariest thing about it, is the fact nobody can save you from errors or key thefts. That's the main drawback. But let's not forget, it is also its main selling point. It is a hard place to be. On that point, insured Bitcoin banks do add some value. but at the cost of additional fees.
The beauty of this self regulation is that NOBODY can yet force you to use those insured bitcoin banks. I don't think you could devise a law that does force you to do so.

Bitcoin is the currency of the capitalists. Conservatives tend to understand capital better than Liberals. Your health is your capital. Your time. Your money. Liberals like policies that redistribute capital from rich to poor. While that's not always a bad thing, Bitcoin tries to avoid control from the state.

Bandwidth. The main reason I don't run the Node all the time is because my latency drops and I can't play with the Node running. There might be a solution to that but I never took the time to research it.
HD size will eventually be an issue if blocks are 10MB.
EDIT; there should be some kind of GUI to configure node settings, like JDownloader allowing you to choose bandwith and number of concurrent downloads. Nobodies like me can't just read through pages of technical documents. It would be neat to configure bandwith settings depending on the time of the day. Full throttle at night.

Both the left and the right in power want to keep the control. They don't want true empowerment of the people. Bitcoin brings empowerment. UBI would too. I have heard a union leader saying UBI is bad because it destroys solidarity. All bullshit to keep the little power they have. Trump likes Bitcoin.

The purpose of this is for someone reading an address, that person can easily say which is which.
You sent from "the bright guy ..." to "the lazy fox ..."
Right now I use the first few letters of the pub hash. But they don't stick in your head. It is easy to be confused which is which.
So the first words are very important, more so than the last. And anyways I think the complete pub hash should be appended... which mean you could use the address  fox swims sea ...pub hash.. You use the words as a prefix for the human mind. # or % or &amp; for the start of a natural language address.

i dunno... you mean the service provider does that over its own network?
I thought the Samsung S4 downloads the updates over WIFI 
Maybe.. It is true that I was in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh when i received the Kitkat update. 
So you mean STC sent the update to my phone? without Samsung being invovled?
EDIT, originially i thought you meant carrier.. locked in carrier like you have in the US.

A posse is small group of people with possibly differing views.
For example. The Libertarians from Texas.
Entities in a posse, are part of a sub network.
The goal is to allow more manageable discussion. Because how can you discuss and argue with 1000+ people replying to your argument.
You can join a posse by actively contributing to it. Posse members slowly rep you.

1)create a p2p forum
2)arguments. is the earth round? Every side of the argument gets to vote on a message to help further the cause of their side. Every 10 minutes the reply with most votes is posted to the question blockchain. every vote is public. Someone committing his vote to "The earth is flat" puts his reputation on the line as illogical. 
Repeat this process for all the questions you like. Sub divide people into pools for each question. 100 pools of 100 persons arguing if the earth is flat or not is more user manageable than 1 pool of 10000 people voting on answers.
3) 3 sides... for/neutral/against... as the neutral people in the pool start to vote on answers, they take a side.. a consensus starts to emerge as to what is "truth" to the question "is the earth flat?" aggregate all the results of all pools.
4) inside a argument, you have to solve sub questions. The argument of the root question stops until that subquestion is solved. in the end you  get a tree of questions answers to reach the truth

that's I see things as well.
there is no way Bitcoin will be used to buy coffee.
unfortunately, the sidechain dev has stalled. The pegging mechanism is tricky.
what do you think about a sidechain whose value cannot go back up to the Bitcoin blockchain. Trading occurs on the exchanges.
In the end sidechains are alts... the pegging being done on exchanges by the market.
Lets say I take the MMO chess blockchain. The miners are the players. They need some ChessCoin to play. So they sell BTC on the exchange for ChessCoins. And then they play.
But BTC is already too expensive to move. So they use another sidechain coin to buy ChessCoins.
Now as more players use ChessCoin, does the value of Bitcoin increases? I don't think so because there is no direct link. You don't need BTC to buy ChessCoins.

@_date: 2017-03-20 13:40:39
ok. more POWA! :)
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:03:34
i have the same opinion. but sadly i am pretty sure China is attacking Bitcoin with miners as weapons. they closed the exchanges. I think it is related to the coming battle.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:18:31
Bicoin is under a sybil attack by sockpuppets.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:35:30
let them fork off. this will be a good test for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:47:06
@_date: 2019-11-30 12:01:19
the beauty of crypto is that you can withdraw your coins.
unless you are a stupid little dog who uses RobinHood or those fake exchanges who are basically only price betting shops.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:10:11
you are a very useful progressive idiot. Obama doubled the debt. fool. Bitcoin will not pay your billion coffees per hour.
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:12:28
sell the BU coins. HODL the core. This is SPARTA!!!
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:43:39
or fiat dies and gov start using bitcoin as the world reserve currency.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:13:57
any power control freak hates Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:40:57
so what?????
HODLERs not impacted.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:25:13
another useful idiot. They come in drove today. If China pays the bill because the plan is for Bitmain to take complete control? Did you fathom this possibility?
@_date: 2019-11-08 22:31:43
revolut does not allow you to withdraw.
you are buying hot air.
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:11:56
sell the BU coins :) HOLD the core
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:58:38
if i want
1ILOVEYOUMARIA ?
I mean CPUs are fine but if we had an ASIC to mine vanities...
EDIT: I is an invalid character :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:21:17
Bitcoin Knights! HOLD RANKS! Slay the Trolls!
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:24:00
i don't transact much. But i use my node when needed. why would someone have a node and not use it for transactions????? The core bitcoin wallet is a node anyways.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:00:14
Let's say as British I buy 100 000 USD now with Euros.
USD goes up in value tremendously. I travel to the United States and spend the USD. Should I pay taxes on the USD purchases because USD has gone up in value ? Do the example again with BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:59:28
is this cash settled or physical?
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:59:34
ever heard of atomic swaps? its a magical way to exchange crypto tokens trustlessly.
however not all tokens are able to implement atomic swaps.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:28:57
yes Satoshi said so.
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:33:37
this brings an issue crypto might solve
how to identify people on the Internet. Bitcoin use private keys. What if I want to create a trustless system to identify an entity for posting messages. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:52:46
it is a Hard Fork social attack.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:40:14
go use BCash fool. Little liberal happy hippie. I am sick to emotional losers who cry everytime there is a roadblock.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:03:57
its going up!! who is buying???
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:45:19
i never signed any agreement. I follow Core Devs. Miners decided 2x. They are free to mine BCash.. they have 8mb block for godsake!
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:21:51
do some research. Honestly I bought Monero on the fact DNMs are starting to use it because Bitcoin can be traced and BITMIXER.IO closed down.
@_date: 2016-06-09 14:48:41
I didn't imply it never happens.
Its a white elephant though. And often is the result of incompetent monetary policy.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:18:03
is a cesspool of idiocy, fud. It fries your brain and you become a troll  controlled by Sauron.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:52:14
all but Monero. I always never paid attention to alts. But when you see Darknet market starting to use Monero.. something is up. I jumped on the Monero train at 90 usd 1 day after the price hike. But hell Monero is the perfect trustless mixing service for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:21:09
because I came later or have less initial funds does not preclude anything. I have a friend who had thousands of bitcoins and sold them at 10USD. He is a bright guy but a bloody idiot at the same time. He says it will be a wound that he will have to live forever and does not want to even think about it. And that was when the price was 500 USD!!!! Can't imagine now with 4000 USD price.
Yes your brother seems like a nice guy who is going to be bossed around by his wife. I Guess he cashed out to impress his wife. I know women. I am not telling anything about my stash and I am not buying her an apartment until I can buy said apartment with bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:14:08
i never signed for 2mb blocks. I don't want them.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:01:08
you are an attention seeker.
we are fucking insanely rich :)
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:58:26
use monero as a mixing service. it is expensive but Monero is truly a cryptographic wonder. complete privacy. no trusting a tumbler or FBI not able to untumble
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:21:12
Monero use case is more clear cut. Will it be possible to do swaps with Monero?
Dash masternodes too weak link. And ZCash trusted setup is a no go. The DarkNetmarket have spoken.
@_date: 2017-01-31 03:09:36
thats why most want more immigration. lower wages. more housing demand. higher house prices..... and Trump is Hitler of course.

@_date: 2018-10-21 10:17:45
Bitcoin is a fully divisible coin.. But can be considered a token when looking at outputs
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:20:10
estimations give him 5% of current total... so maybe 3% of total supply.
his coins has never moved... ever lol.

BCH is a good experiment. Let the rodents run. Smart guys are watching :)

those tulip lovers are losing the biggest bull run ever. Bitcoin is the purest form of money to ever exist. Tulips never meant to be money.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:50:49
he is talking about exchanges you fool. regulated entities that must protect customer funds.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:19:35
fair enough. that's the core road map as well anyways. Push offchain and when really needed increase blocksize. It is not needed now.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:53:32
CNN is fake news.. its just fake news that you like to hear.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:58:53
Care to explain what "regulatory compliant" means in the case of a fork like 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:35:02
yes. Core dev will destroy Miners power forever by creating a complex POW mixing CPU Asics and different proofs.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:35:48
except you are a troll shill. I have written down your name on my troll list. Go back to Mordor.

if you don't like it.. buy Moneros
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:49:57
peer to peer. go read the definition. then install bitcoin core and synch the blockchain. A few questions will be answered.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:55:11
i never signed that agreement. No Core Dev signed that agreement. BIP 148 draw a line in the sand.
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:34:20
they did the same to the Donald
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:47:36
you are a shill Inthewirelain. go back to Mordor.

@_date: 2017-08-18 11:37:27
there always be a divide.. stupid emotional liberal. bitcoin will always be attacked using a wedge to create division.
fight to stay on right path. You sound like those stupid characters in Walking Dead who are unable to kill zombies. If you never sell Whales cannot take your money.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:58:36
exactly.. anyone shitting on full nodes is trying to destroy Bitcoin, willingly or like a useful idiot.
DESTROY THOSE PEOPLE. They want to harm you.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:34:00
i trust Core Devs to find a new POW that will destroy Miners forever.. like a POW that mix Asics and CPU... something bright like adaptive algo that change randomly based on a hash computation result.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:28:35
as long as bitcoin is decentralized thanks to small blocks, nobody can take over.
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:00:30
what about the risk of custody?
Who keeps the keys?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:58:18
i want every BTC user to run his own node at home peer to peer satoshi's style. i want every BTC user to use coins as store of value and exchange big items such as houses, cars with it. I want BTC users to use Monero as a mixer service to trade on DNM (Darknetmarkets). I think drugs should be legal for a lot of social and economical reasons.
I am a software dev and i understand why big blocks will lead any crypto currency down the path toward centralization. I will keep using VISA to buy stuff on Amazon or use Bitcoin to top off Amazon wallets.
thank you for asking.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:54:36
well my theory is that Satoshi is Alan Greenspan so who cares. And use Monero for the dark stuff.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:42:04
well in this case assets are increasing in value. my gox BTC Yens are stuck in limbo and I can't use them to invest!!!

I like it. Some competition to Chineese mining is good.

didn't he have enough Bitcoin to be happy? I guess you can point me towards Roger Ver
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:44:58
that's why those stupid noob trader who short Bitcoin can get destroyed at anytime.
just buy and HODL
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:28:41
Bitcoin will learn and get stronger from this BCH thing.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:19:36
damn that was a nice price
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:09:45
well that does not work when the blockchain becomes mutable. ETC would work better. 
Let's see how casper work out.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:37:20
great write up. thk you.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:57:22

@_date: 2017-08-29 09:16:06
your brother is an idiot. Sorry. You are not. Be he is. Cashing out now to buy a house? Can't he wait a few more years? Oh well... people like your brother are spreading coins around. But his wife is going to kill him when Bitcoin is 50k a pop.

nice. Trump sent a congressman to represent the gov. Go Trump! 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:25:36
my post was a reply to you agreeing. Then i went on a tangent ranting on the typical loser you replied to. The same kind of idiot who cries and shakes when he sees  zombies approaching. War is war. Bitcoin will always be at war.
Some people you have to slap them in the face just to get their attention.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:46:01
Working as designed. Use paypal for coffee buys or amazon with customer protection.
Bitcoin is for censorship resistance and store of value.
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:10:07
i was thinking a reputation system based on a blockchain. of course this could be gamed and corporations and marketeers could buy identities.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:33:53
sync the blockchain using the p2p program written by Satoshi to understand what it entails. Stop hiding behind wikipedia.

how are they mining so fast? i see fast blocks
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:49:45
he is right why not using DOGE? I mean BCash is just an sophisticated attack to control Bitcoin. I won't be fooled and will stick for core devs.
@_date: 2016-06-09 14:51:23
it is theft for you. it is making that engine go up and down. and by side effect the invisible hand make wonders for the good of humanity.
It is loads of fun for those in power. They force the people below them to work for them.
someone got to work the factories and clean the toilets. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:11:01
i like your take on things. I agree drug users will buy bitcoin at any price... they will spent it fast though.. Are DNM dealers keeping BTC or selling for dollars?
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:02:03
i just noticed... just very surprised they manage to spread 14 mBTC fee around. i see around 16 customers in the output. that's about 1mbtc per user. Free!
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:16:34
valuation should take into account lost coins. otherwise it is skewed.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:09:32
i answered truly and honestly. you didn't answer. then I don't care what you think 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:03:10
working as designed. block space is not free. go use paypal
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:55:05
ETH will also crumble under its own weight.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:43:31
i guess i triggered a few liberal SJW. Fact is all my friends don't have the computer knowledge and cojones to do what I am doing. I am teaching those willing. But I am hard teach. Do as I say or get lost. Now GET UR DAMN COINS OUT OF THE EXCHANGE or i stop talking to you.
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:46:43
because I need the full blockchain to track my own transactions history.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:31:01
anyone smearing the run of full node is a pro fudder or a useful idiot.
RUN A FULL NODE. I ask all my friends that buy Bitcoins to install Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:52:15
Exiocoin lol.. they will not reveal that state until AFTER the ico!!! scam
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:40:51
i would choose a solution that does not require a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:51:01
Etf how do they hard fork?
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:13:08
it is a power play. Who decides what Bitcoin is? Think about the future. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:32:06
best privacy you can buy... but tx fees will be huge and scaling problematic... tx size are 30X bitcoin tx. 
where do you buy IOTA? it is interesting.

you gave 200 euros to whales.
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:02:32
well i am not as bright as you are... but now i understand. still 1mbtc free per customer.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:55:01
start pricing things in Bitcoin if you want to reach the moon. How many Bitcoin is a new car worth ? 10 bitcoin. then watch the price of cars go down.
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:53:00
I liked the article
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:16:50
yea he is among the many idiots who sold. I got a friend who sold his 1000+ coins around 10 USD too... He cannot think about it. It makes him ill. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:02:07
yep. just keep asking those trolls to run the bitcoin blockchain at home, peer to peer's satoshi's style.
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:58:34
i just outed you as a FUDDER.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:52:17
the FUDDERS are back in force.. Big blockers go back to BCASH. Bitcoin stays at 1mb block for now.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:14:52
the smart elite has already bought Bitcoin so they don't care.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:49:42
Bitcoin is stealing gold thunder hahahah! Boum.. Why? Because of Bitcoin INTRISINC qualities. Can you store Gold bars in your head? Nope. Can you send Gold bars over the Internet? Nope. Can you pay porn online with Gold? Nope. Can you pay drugs on the darknetmarket with Gold bars? Nope.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:06:14
yes it will... but you never know from which price. Let this lesson teach the noobs timing the market is futile.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:51:29
go cry me a river. supply and demand. go to bcash if u want cheap fees.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:54:43
yes brings confusion. my cousin read an article by a MSM paper saying Bitcion Cash was an upgrade that allowed more transactions. He was going to buy some.
All hype because 1000 USD.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:50:12
go buy Bcash you troll if you believe that's the best solution.

i was tempted to buy some lol.. but the scaling issues with Monero are a bit daunting. The network is clogged already.
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:46:57
put all your wealth in BTC and be done with it.
only pay with BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:02:53
Yes. that i understand. In the US, Bitcoin is property. My question is.. what would change if Bitcoin was deemed "currency"? What are the advantages for us?
@_date: 2017-01-09 06:16:06
you sound like a guy from the losing team of Hillary Clinton. Correct the Record. Create a narrative to support the establishment. I don't believe you. I used Megaupload and the current mega file locker, it is a great tool much better than dropbox.

@_date: 2017-08-13 10:33:49

bitcoin is divisible. pay 1/2 bitcoin for the apple. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:50:55
your analogy is rare collectibles is just wrong. Store 1 billion USD of your cards on a USB stick? Which academic consensus can do THAT????
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:51:28
can't you read? XMR is Monero. Drug dealers convert Bitcoin in and out Monero. Shapeshift... or atomic swaps. Monero doesn't see any fiat. I sent u a pm. anyways BTC is used for drug dealing for a long time already.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:49:12
hey goldbug. Bitcoin is stealing gold thunder hahahah! Boum.. Why? Because of Bitcoin INTRISINC qualities. Can you store Gold bars in your head? Nope. Can you send Gold bars over the Internet? Nope. Can you pay porn online with Gold? Nope. Can you pay drugs on the darknetmarket with Gold bars? Nope.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:38:37
why? Because you were manipulated into thinking that trading was a good strategy. you probably voted for Obama. NEVER SELL. Only spend your bitcoin when you REALLY need it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:15:52
everytime you access a 3rd party node, that node records which address you are interested in. BCASH sucks!

@_date: 2017-08-29 12:30:16

@_date: 2017-08-25 02:28:13
I understand better now
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:48:59
ETH is not a store of value. They are trying and will fork to change the rules so it may become one... but then how do I fund my smart contracts? Gold isn't oil.

Coinbase are not the best. Bitstamp BTC withdrawals are free for the user! I got the 1st confirmation about 30 minutes. Fees was 14mbtc for 16 customers. 640 sat/ byte lol
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:40:22
fat transactions means less txs per block.
fees are around 1 dollars now.
But i see it as a positive. People pay for moving Monero. Just like Bitcoin. It means it has a future. Monero has dynamic block size but it adapts slowly. Do some research.. i found about it exactly a few days ago. Its awesome. But IMO will be a niche for its use case and IRS will fight it to death.

Bitcoin is a medium of exchange if you are willing to pay the price for the blockspace. Drug users will pay it and will even use XMR as a mixing service to avoid be tracked on the open ledger.  But otherwise there is no real use case as a payment system for small things until LN channels are used.

But fuck them. I don't have a single once of trust in Microsoft.
Besides RoboVM was not inferior. The Google reality game Ingress was based on it. And they had to migrate pokemon go to shitty C# Unity.

I agree we have to work together. Disavow CNN and all the lying media whores and Obama the greatest divisive president ever. We will see about Trump. My little fingers tell me he is going to succeed. He has the huge ego of an alpha male that will help him destroy the wussies around him whining for more power.

@_date: 2019-10-07 08:45:01
ok I got you now. Following your logic, would Bitcoin be technically a security if the genesis block was spendable? ;)
Very nice argument to put forward when debating other coins. Bitcoin genesis block is not spendable. therefore its not a security.
@_date: 2019-08-18 10:37:59
CME futures are not that bad. Provides more exposure to the real world.

Bitcoin is indeed akin to a pyramid scheme. Future gains are only possible if new investors come in. If new investors stop coming in the growth in value stops and the whole thing might collapse.
This is also true of every currency system. Social security also depends on new blood entering the workplace. 
Social Security works on the assumption of a pyramid. The pyramid of the ages given by Nature. 
Every system of value is technically a ponzi scheme requiring a future of demand. 
A system of value only works if participants all believe it will have value in the future. It's a collective illusion. Its a Ponzi. It works until it doesn't.
Thankfully for Bitcoin investors, Bitcoin's blockchain provides more that just a currency system. The Ultimate Notary of Truth.

silver lining to blanket KYC on crypto. no more wrench attacks. because you could just report the stolen BTC on the black list.

PascalCoin maybe does that? They don't have a ledger. I tried their wallet. It is a funny little coin. You need to buy an account from a miner. You can't create adresses.

when I read you i see that you are not a bitcoin believer. You are some kind of troll. Probably salty for bad BTC trades.
Because small caps chains are less secured. Bitcoin will be used on top of others. NO blockchain can secure every single transactions. Bitcoin is the king. ALT service what the King does not want to do.

@_date: 2017-11-18 13:20:38
man I am not trolling.
I am saying the USD is in the bank but they keep a ratio in BTC as well! The BTC is just there to help trust that there is indeed USD in the bank! Let's say they have to keep a 20% ratio in BTC. give or take depending on the BTC price. They would need 20k USD worth of BTC in the BTCTetherTrust for every 100k USD in the bank account.
The USD Tether still keeps its 1 to 1 relationship to USD fiat.

in your comment, you just proved my point. Arbitrage DOES INDEED BUY REAL BITCOINS ON EXCHANGE.
Arbitrage of a big short? Tell me exactly the steps ? One trader sees the big short on futures and sells Bitcoins on an exchange because he expects price to go down.. But the trader DOES NOT HAVE ANY BITCOIN TO SELL!!

@_date: 2017-11-13 12:16:55
that's my issue. a state will try to steal Bitcoin hashrate by creating an official crypto with the same hashing algo.. then what?
Bitcoin needs an EDA for long term security and stability. I made a post about averaging block size to 1mb every 10 minutes. So if you mine a block after 1 hour, you can put 6mb of transactions. The net result is 1mb every 10 minutes. No effect on blockchain size.

I would not want Bitcoin to be obfuscated like Monero.
Transparency has value. Think about being unable to see if Satoshi spends his coins? Does this info have value to you? To the community? I sure like the fact everyone can see and react to the fact Satoshi or big holders are moving their funds.
Its a double edge sword I agree. 
I never said Monero will be superior to Bitcoin. I said it will keep the niche use case.

In all 166 nations that are signatories to the Berne Convention, copyright is granted to an author when the work is created. The author holds a monopoly on all copyright rights (creating modifications, creating and distributing copies, etc.). You -- as someone who is not the author -- have been granted none of those rights.
A license is a mechanism by which the rights-holder (here, the author) grants some set of rights to a recipient (here, you). You say that the author has not offered any license, which means by default that the author has reserved all of his rights. The fact that the author has made his code publicly viewable does not mean that you have been granted any rights beyond the right to view the code. The right to make derivative works and the right to redistribute the code are not rights that you currently have.

but seeing how my country asks me everything.. by law.. if I lie i pay fines or go to jail.

the value is important. If you buy a house for 20 BTC you will be pay 20 dollars or whatever for next block priority.

I agree. It was just a random idea.

indeed. never trust them. they are like a bank
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:14:22
i agree. It was just an idea. I don't have to skills to make such a formal proof. Maybe someone reading this post will.
The size of the block depends on the time of last generated block. What is the time, formally? I see that time is based on an external oracle. And that is a problem. You need to trust that oracle. How could you defined block timing without external trust?

i disagree on 1 point.
Crypto is decentralized for the most part. Coins in cold wallets are not sold easily.
There are only 21 milllions of coins.
Shares don't have external utility.

too small a purchase already. especially when the network is busy pre fork. IMO BTC is good for buying big ticket items such as houses.
You can write in the contract the transaction ID, time. The blockchain notarizes the deal for both parties. No need of bullshit anymore.

Because you are dumb brain deficiency not to understand the value proposition of bitcoin. Others do.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:45:09
with unlimited fiat, they could prop up BCash and bring up Bitcoin transaction fees very high because blocks are mined every hour. Still think the average block size is a good idea on top of difficulty adjustment.

i am a long time hodler and I am not salty at all. I am a software engineer and I know you can't have everything. Bigger blocks will come in time. 
Look i see this way. I won't a give a shit about BCH security but I will use it for coffee purchaes. I will fund an ALT wallet from BTC and use that to make small buys. And I won't give a single shit about the alt censorship resistance.

i agree currently time needs an external oracle.. unless someone can create a new formalism of time on a blockchain using crypto? Bitcoin does have a baked in notion of it with its 10 minutes PoW. That's one tick. Divide this tick into 100 ?
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:07:52
no. because Bitcoin is currency. never sell until the moon. i.e. until LTC and BTC are spent in a closed loop with no fiat involved. You will not need to cash out. Just spend it. That's the beauty of crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:33:34

BCash actually competes with Bitcoin 2nd layers hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:55:26
yes. BTC needs a block average of 1mb every 10 minutes. So if only 1 block every hour, miner mines a block of 6mb. This would remove spamming attacks altogether.

I think anyone threatening anyone of torture should be executed on the spot by the police

@_date: 2017-11-30 12:22:54
if u had a bitcoin you would have sold it at 100$ because you are not a saver. You do not understand HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:36:15
i agree Eth has had good returns. People need to buy Eth to buy ERC20 tokens.
I am not arguing that.
BTC was not premined.
BTC creator is gone. Core dev is a group of 100+ devs.
Eth motto is breaking things, advance fast. 
Smart contracts don't work without trusted oracles. I don't see the need for censorship resistant smart contracts. ICOs right. But those concepts are easily transferable to any blockchain.
i will invest in a smart contract platform. But not a blockchain that I can't download easily and whose growth is INSANE and thus has no long term future.

its depends. for cheap alts. i use sats
for big ticker items i use btc. 
for medium stuff like eth. ltc.. i use millis... LTC is in the 15s right now...millis implicit.
but why would I need USD to count my Bitcoins? I know exactly how many btcs i have and i know more or less how many BTC i have in fiat.

never sell until the moon. i.e. until LTC and BTC are spent in a closed loop with no fiat involved.

I am pro bitcoin. but some alts such as Monero with mandatory privacy have niche use cases.

How do you define a checkpoint? And how is it implemented.

@_date: 2018-03-06 12:34:19
it is not only about the current state.
you have to verify with the CPU that the state is the correct one. you can only do that with checking all the txs from the genesis block.
if users only rely on utxos.. i believe attacks to modify the utxo are possible.

Because its more profitable to mine Bitcoin. Hashpower will follow the price ratio.
However to defend his baby, Jihan is ready to lose money and send all his hashpower to his BCH fork. This of course disrupts Bitcoin mining but smart people don't care. They know what's going on.

@_date: 2019-01-25 21:08:42
well exactly.. that's why nobody really invest in those.
but in Pascal Coin, its good. Coins are located on accounts themselves located on a public key. Accounts have unique names. My girlfriend forgot her password. Her name would be forever lost without asset decay.
some coins are not designed for store of value property.

i agree with you.
However, in my country,  when paying for auction i won in cash, they forced me to flag the listing as paid.... and guess what?
behind my back without my consent, ebay magically allowed paypal to pay the guy again!!
so i paid for the item twice. Once in cash, and then without knowing about it when flagging auction as paid!!! I am currently trying to get my money back. Its a nightmare. I don't trust this process anymore.
Basically they make you live hell if you don't pay with Paypal anywhere. I never see options for cash or bank wire.

@_date: 2019-01-25 20:49:59
some coins such as Pascal Coin decided to reclaim coins that haven't moved after 4 years of block decay.
Its done at the protocol level. Miners simply collect dead coins.
I am not advocating this for Bitcoin. far from it. Its a nice experiment though.
On the flip side, its pretty easy to see if your coins are in danger. Simply doing a small operation reset the block decay counter.
It does provide miners potential income and prevent lost blockchain assets

i wanted to create a transaction by selecting ouputs using the GUI. select the fee etc.
Instead of pressing the Send Button. I could press another button named Sign Transaction that would sign the transaction and ouput in a window the same stuff that CLI signrawtransaction  
I can then copy paste the textual representation of the transaction and push it on another computer..
This allows to use an offline computer to sign transactions conveniently and then push them on a hot wallet. I use a USB hdd to synch the blockchain

BTC is BTC. You are confused. If people want to buy rocks... that does not devalue/inflate BTC. 
Other cryptos are not BTC. 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC out of 21 millions BTC

Bitcoin mining is economic growth and down the road miners improve green energy technology.. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:02:38
i agree with all.. I cannot stand all the people who take a shit on BTC while Bitcoin is supporting all the alts. I see Bitcoin was the warden of the crypto ecosystem.

i disagree about 2nd statement.
Everyone will start mining with new POW and as long as mining is decentralized, network is safe. CPU mining.

It was the february debate. there are references of it but no videos of it can be found. i don't listen to Limbaugh at all. It was the first and only MTV debate in 2008. The format was great but the format could not be manipulated by the MSM.. so canned it. cuz people could react online... they did not like the results hahaha

HODLERS are the true winners.

Trump is deemed a fraud too like Bitcoin. Thus My point was Trump is not a fraud..... because Bitcoin is not fraud like we all know.

@_date: 2017-09-12 19:15:00
so what? people can buy BTC with RMBT
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:01:49
they could print satoshi bank notes after buying bitcoin and letting it sit on a publicly known address.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:49:36
do you have fiat money ready on exchanges to do exactly that? If not, you are full of it and a wussy pussy.

@_date: 2017-10-31 23:49:55
i don't think they can do it. Because you and I can buy Bitcoin AND TAKE DELIVERY. We can deplete the coins available on the exchanges sold by panic sellers who believe the fake manipulated future price.

@_date: 2017-10-31 19:48:11

a HODLer is someone who does not panic sell and does not sell BTC at a loss in USD.
selling 10% of your BTC stash at a high price is different. you can't buy stuff in BTC yet.

the wallet does not have to know about transaction A because transaction A hasn't been mined!!
It is like saying.. createrawtransaction and signrawtransaction in the Debug Console makes the wallet unusable.

i don't understand. If there are not selling bitcoins. how will that affect the price of bitcoins???? Real people buying real bitcoin? market based on offer and demand. lets say you see a big short on the futures. and nobody sells real bitcoins. what happens?

I personally know bankers and traders who tell people around to invest in Ethereum and ripple.. while saying Bitcoin is slow gives less returns.

@_date: 2018-02-12 21:50:14
ok i will try again. what wallet do you use?
But i am ready to bet the farm that you synchronized the ethereum state, not the full blockchain.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:56:53
not for ethereum... lol are you high? Ethereum's only real use case is ICO
@_date: 2018-03-28 09:47:44

Impossible to synchronize the eth chain AND stay synchronized. i need to trust a 3rd party.
It is not about synching just the eth state. that's pointless
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:16:56
not if you keep your wealth in BTC and since BTC is going to be worth 50k USD in a few years.

People want Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:30:42
i read about it.
POS coins can be rewritten at will when centralized.
How are users going to check a 4 Terabytes blockchain for the POS stakers historical corrections? Stakers can fuck over finalities like butter. don't come with your little tricks.
DPOS is fine what EOS wants to do though. Bitcoin will be the crypto reserver currency everyone will trust 100%.. EOS will be semi trusted for its use cases.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:46:03
Trading on Bitshares DEX is a nice experience though. all governed by consensus. no insider trading. no front running. everything is open.
i buy bitUSD there to go stable coin while trading with 10% of my crypto stash.

@_date: 2017-10-06 09:56:25
yea i see Core changing the POW if Miners mine 2x coin...
So miners are taking a HUGE risk supporting 2x. 
Push this argument to miners and 2x is dead
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:45:47
do you know Pascal coin and its safebox? 
it is a more secured version of synching the ethereum fast state.
I don't agree with you. Eth fast sync downloads the full state. 44gb.. not the full blockchain. It is impossible to download 500gb in 3 hours. at least not with my connection.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:07:31

Julian Assange is using Hype to forward his interests. That's how he turned Wikileaks into a brand. I believe it is a good thing. It brings awereness because the MSN is trying to control the narrative.. always.

the wallet does consider the UTXO upon signing. It has the copy of the blockchain. 
Sign and forget example is just to show you want I wish the wallet had.

good post. I am not against alt per se. If you look back my post history a few months ago... i was explaining I fully expect alts such as litecoin to become "sidechains" where it was cheaper to store transactions and even litecoin won't give you billions of coffee buys. Ethereum is an experimental tech but i don't trust Microsoft a satoshi. There is a shady deal in the back. Microsoft is using the community. I am a programmer and bugs are never the exception. Complex smart contracts are a recipe for disaster. (e.g. DAO). Casper and PoS is anything but a done deal. My feeling is Eth token has become a pump scam. It was not. But now it is. Ask yourself this question. Do you really think Microsoft, Samsung will back the public eth chain where they cannot mutate things? NO WAY!!! The principle of code is law is down the toilet. On the upside, Eth is doing experimental work that can be cloned to a real immutable DApp blockchain. But the issue of contract bugs NEVER will go away.

also quote from a blog
 Like you said, a bug will cause the "effective" theft of a huge amount of funds.
2. Someone will make a contract that unexpectedly makes a huge amount of money. That contract however will have absolutely no mechanism for extracting this money, forever locking the money it makes away beyond reach of anyone.
3. Someone will make a contract that the American government has deemed illegal. That contract will have been made such that there is no off switch. The only possible way for them to stop it would be to convince the majority of the network to remove it via a protocol update. I expect they will not be able to get this majority and thus we have an unstoppable force meets immovable object situation.
4. Ethereum will have it's `npm` left-pad moment when a contract that is used widely is suddenly suicided. The number of down stream effects will be enormous. Most of them will be unfixable.

it is a logical conclusion of my eth studies. The Eth blockchain is sooo big it won't be decentralized.

if you don't run your own full node , you are not running Bitcoin peer to peer. I use SPV wallets only for pocket money (200 dollars)
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:30:00
how could you prove that? Isn't the Eth token infinite in value? Infinite inflation.

use your mind to create an experiment. create a coin pre mined with 1 trillion space duck token. start mining space duck token.  now with friends you start trading your  space duck token token for 1 usd. So the official exchange rate of the  space duck token becomes the facto 1usd What's the market cap of  space duck token? Let's say I buy mine your token and people buy it. All fine. Because you will not sell your 1 trillion stash.... ahhh what is the market cap again? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:11:14

Bitcoin has that use case locked. Store of value and fast and censorless transmission across borders. We need to keep blocksize smally manageable. that's all!
Bitcoin will reach 10k in the coming years.

nah USD is safe. FDIC insured. Bitcoins are not safe until you own the private keys.

@_date: 2017-07-06 14:38:04
download the blockchain. sync YOUR node every week. Do peer to peer Bitcoin. Don't trust anyone but the code. Big blocks lead to corporate bitcoin nodes that can filter and censor transactions.

@_date: 2017-07-27 20:03:13
Ethereum tech is promising I agree with you. However it is a premined security fraud like all ICOS. The biggest issue IMO is that contracts are not proofed. Then you have the mutability. I think Eth tech will be use in private where you can undo stuff

you see things with the eyes of a banker. producer-consumer. A bitcoin user does not trust anyone. if you start trusting 3rd parties.. you can be blocked from accessing the network.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:56:19
until Nick Szabo confirms with Satoshi's keys.. just a theory.
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:23:22
keep the CEX honest
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:29:45
well mutability of Ethereum is a feature!!! They can sell it to Microsoft.
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:49:40
Peer to Peer 
you are a bloody idiot. Download the blockchain on your computer and start doing peer to peer... with big blocks this becomes impossible for most home users.
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:09:44
i didn't say speculate. Banks will use bitcoin as a store of value...like they use gold but with the advantages of the digital currency. it will be a collateral upon which they will be able to create credit.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:43:51
how did you install it? Just download bitcoin core ?
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:01:49
state secrets are from the dark ages..
the state works for its citizens. no secrets needed.
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:58:18
bad vision. Hodl and spend BTC. Never go back to fiat again.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:24:26
when dump to 1k?
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:11:32
when you sell, you send the fund to the exchange to sell them or maybe you spend the coins directly. that's the moon.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:34:52
i know. i have a 400 kilobyte per second connection. it is a pain to download the chain. It takes ages. even more reason to keep blocks small.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:26:37
hahahaha... i laugh because it was technically not feasible to run Ethereum at even average scale. People bought the scam. Scaling is a HARD problem.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:08:54
if Banks start using bitcoin as a store of value. it will reach higher.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:08:02
exactly this. you cannot have a popular distributed blockchain with cheap fees.
a sidechain peg, channels tech is needed.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:29:52
well as AA said.. engineers will always find ways to use space/bandwidth. Myself a programmer. I was dreaming 3 years ago of using the blockchain to store game state. LOL... Forget about it with fees.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:54:21
nobody knows except Trolls.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:24:04
i fully support Core. Software Engineer.
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:16:49
Coindesk is propaganda machine bought and paid for... just like CNN.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:30:14
bigger blocks lead to centralization.. go back to Mordor.
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:49:56
Proof of Key event is threatening paper bitcoins..
only way is up.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:54:23
the issue is what have different semantics of what constitutes a real coin.
In some ways the only real successful coins are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero... the rest are wannabes.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:55:19
well the issue is different with DApp. If your smart contract only runs during a given timeframe... and the network is congested. 
a blockchain when successful will always run with a backlog of transactions. Status ICO is a glimpse of success for Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:20:20
yes it is. It increases the strength of the weakest link Absolute security does not exists.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:38:37
and you are a kneejerk emotional liberal.
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:19:34
so this event is doing its work.. Coinbase coins are not your coins.. You didn't really know that before. did you?
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:27:18
yep.. the chineese gov controls Jihan and they want to control Bitcoin development.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:30:09
isn't the blockchain supposed to prevent this? A central power can decide which transactions go first.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:47:29
segwit first.. than blocksize increase down the road.. Anyone pushing for a HF now is a FUDDER or simply an idiot.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:39:58
you are/sound like a fudder and a shill... go back to Mordor.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:02:14
buy back, send your bitcoins to a bitcoin core wallet on one of your home computer and forget about it... of course do your homework and back ups.
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:58:09
Coinbase is going to scam the coins by lending some to people. By running a fractionnal reserve. Anyone keeping his coins on coinbase deserves to be goxxed
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:36:28
Liege or Namur?
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:58:29
my point DAPPs is a pipedream... just like Bitcoin as a currency.
The only real use case I see.. is Bitcoin as a banking standard 2.0.... Bitcoin being used as collateral.
Ethereum will go private.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:10:39
i have back ups of my wallet files
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:25:58
lol because Ethereum has fixed the scaling issue? Noob need to eat some berries. Eth blockchain will destroy Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:53:20
then you are a smart fudder.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:11:27
Because none has the name recognition yet
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:59:30
a virtual keyboard doesn't display text but bitmaps, whose order can be randomized to increase security. Your event controller records the click and map it to a letter using its internal map. The matching letter is forwarded to the wallet without going down the application stack. The OS is not aware of anything except the paint and the click.
A keylogger by its own name does not record all the screen repaints. This is not feasible in practice for now. Now they could copy only an area around the mouse click. You could make several level of security. Randomly asks the user to select with the physical keyboard or the virtual keyboard or a mouse gesture using a predefined message code: Orange, Blue, Green. 
Creativity is endless. :)
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:37:11
And dogecoin database is free ?
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:22:19
watch all the shitcoin bag holders come and FUD Bitcoin POW network.
In the end, there can only be one.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:41:40
don't you understand the politics of it? If we Hard Fork now for 2MB, it sets a precedent to fork away. Besides SegWit kills ASICBOOST. First SegWit, then when needed down the road increase blocksize.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:43:15
well I can't send big pictures to my mates in Australia... forget about my HD movie of my last holidays. Applications for blockchain blockspace is limitless. Bitcoin should focus on what it is good at. If writing a coffe buy costs less than 10 cents... I am going to write a chess game whose every state is written to the blockchain and players will have to pay for the next move haha. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:26:23
why cares about cex.io.. why do you keep talking about them?
I never used them and never will. not even visiting the site.
do you keep referring to bitcoin.com when people talk about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:25:49
Wrong. You don't understand the moon.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:52:45
this says a lot about the evil forces trying to kill Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:49:45
emotional illogical liar. Bitcoin has a well pre defined cap. Eth does not.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:45:06
True or not. It is very likely. Pavel Durov was in holidays in the USA for one week. He was approached by cia...nsa... jihan lives in China...
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:14:44
5the moon is banking standard. You are out of touch. Bitcoin is deadly conservative. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:48:27
now imagine a guy in a poor country with a dictator... how does he use Bitcoin if the blocks are so big he can't sync on it. he will have to trust a 3rd party ???
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:31:55
bitcoin is technical. too many noobs overloaded by their ego.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:24:57
hello shill
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:20:12
well then if your assumption is correct, that makes them emotional children.
Blocksize increase will happen down the road anyways. They oppose Segwit based on emotional reasons not technical facts. They should be ignored and sent back to kid garden.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:31:59
Because doing a centralized coin is illegal unless it is a security.
@_date: 2017-07-10 10:54:52
Trump ate russian salad!!! OMG OMG OMG OMG. Trump is a russian puppet!!!!
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:05:30
hey coinbase noobs.. install your own wallets on your own computers.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:17:27
lol Ethereum is a big scam. infinite tokens. big pre mine. Bought by Microsoft. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:20:06
Weak mind. Weak hand.
Those people are necessary to spread bitcoins around.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:33:03
i like turtling
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:20:25
yes. Blockchain is a distributed database.. fees will always be high. Use a sidechain for small transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:21:25
When you read Szabo, you can feel a little jealousy.
After all those years, he couldn't find THE solution. Someone else had found it.
Good job Satoshi!
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:22:57
satoshi original idea was the remove 3rd party trust. if blocks are too big, the blockchain becomes centralized.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:20:58
exactly. I don't care if Ethereum gets  spot with market cap. Ethereum is a premined scam bought by Microsoft.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:43:19
spot on
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:43:03
Bitcoin will always be under attack. Remember always. Stack and Hodl on a private wallet. They can't reach you. :)
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:00:50
go back to Mordor little orc sniffer
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:00:58
too mental..
paper gold.. paper bitcoins.. you need to meme the dumb noobs who keep their crypto on exchanges.
Keep the CEX HONEST.
EDIT: besides.. paper wallets are actually private keys... so not really bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:38:02
yes. my bitcoin node uses the full thing. i don't trust anyone.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:09:37
fudder lol. go back to Mordor
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:44:06
disclaimer.. be careful of replay attacks. Most noobs should just stack and hodl.
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:07:08
Satoshi is a former geeky central banker.. Best theory of all.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:05:57
yea new redditor fudder hahaha go back to Mordor ghost.
@_date: 2018-12-23 16:46:27
as a software engineer i agree.
javascript is not good enough for hardened security.
its not because its the easier and most used language on github that its a secured language. Actually people like it because they can act stupid with it and not be bothered by the compiler. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:10:17
HODlers on their own node totally unaffected.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:25:40
same. I don't care about Ethereum scammy market cap lol.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:46:58
yes. I spent 15 000 USD on a virtual army Clash of Clans.
@_date: 2016-07-27 10:35:47
like all the Sanders SJW kissing Hillary's butt now?  A SJW is an emotionally driven idiot. They use social justice to feel good with no analysis. Trump is an ORANGE MORON RACIST CLOWN. Do you support Trump? yes. YOU RACIST NAZI. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:46:18
yea Ethereum is compromised. Microsoft is evil.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:24:28
market cap means crap. I can create a coin with a trillion tokens and create fake bid/sell with bots.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:04:48
you are a noob.. install your own wallet on one of your old laptop. sync on the chain create a wallet and send ur coins to there.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:42:35
well i don't have much Bitcoin on exchanges.. most in cold storage..
But I will withdraw what's left...
I just didn't understand the proof of key... like I have to sign a message with my bitcoin address and thus lose some anonimty.
So proof of key is just a rallying cry to remove all Bitcoins from exchanges? nothing more?
@_date: 2016-07-20 14:53:29
use a mobile phone wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:14:21
ask your friends to install Bitcoin Core on their own computers and use that wallet. If that are not able to do that. They are suckers and should not invest in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-24 20:25:27
What is the blocktime of Ethereum?
@_date: 2016-07-20 14:37:39
a friend of mine bought into OneCoin.. she is like brainwashed. :(
OneCoin  marketed its obvious failings compared to Bitcoin as winners. OneCoin is better because its CENTRALIZED. LOL :)
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:57:04
what if price does not reach 1000usd?
This is what happened to so many people during the last bear market. They sold at 400 usd and never came back. they are OUT. And too but hurt to buy bitcoin again.
HODL at least 1 BTC if you want Crypto to succeed in beating the banks.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:57:20
lol a trust in 2010 when there was no market for bitcoin????? it was worth peanuts.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:27:23
Big Blocks kill Bitcoin nodes in hard to reach places.
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:27:37
Ethereum has many devs because the tech will be used on private blockchain.. i.e. mutable.... Eth is a nice toy but contracts can't be prooved mathematically so Eth is going nowhere. Nobody is going to use 100k contracts that can "possibly" be hacked/
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:37:03
an ERC20 token is not a coin!
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:33:53
It was so sooo easy.. where is that Facebook coin?
Sorry but it seems you are over your head.
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:27:03
BTC current inflation is there so current noobs can buy cheap coins.
BTC inflation schedule will never change. Forget about it. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:49:29
you can not read analogies... metaphors... 
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:24:19
I agree. And they are so many BU/Ver/Jihan shillls on this sub that it proves the evil intentions behind.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:58:33
just install Bitcoin Core on a spare laptop. encrypt the wallet. store copies of that wallet in different locations
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:31:32
exactly.. those exchanges are a huge liability in the future
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:59:19
bitcoin core node on a spare laptop
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:46:28
you are an idiot... Wright could sell Bitcoins..
Bitcoins in a trust... lol what load of bs.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:50:58
Attacks don't allow chain rewrites. Just double spends. Your hodl accounts are safe
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:38:51
we don't have evidence... do you have evidence that the NSA is trying to backdoor most computer systems? What probability do you give to this statement "Chineese Financial Authorities met with Jihan do discuss Bitcoin matters?"
I give it VERY LIKELY.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:12:27
well let's hope the trust lost the private keys then. imagine the trust keeper readin the keys?? lol.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:11:56
lol.. the goal to use the public chain hahaha
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:49:22
exactly.. in the light of your explanations.. only traders and gov stooges would FUD the Proof of Key event..
January 3rd!!!
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:30:52
you are wrong. market cap means bullshit.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:21:01
go back to your mom's lap liberals. If you are not computer literate enough to run your own node on your computer.. you shouldn't be investing in the crypots.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:53:36
Bitcoin will be attacked again and again.
I don't trust segwit2x HF. 
BIP148 or statu quo is fine.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:55:25
Another dao will happen for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:30:06
yea maybe on a sidechain called progressive liberal :)
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:06:59
buy bitcoin and send the coins to a wallet your control on your own computer. Do not trade. You will lose. The house always wins.
it sounds terrible that so many noobs are not computer literate to install Bitcoin Core on their computers.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:34:01
i heard about Microsoft Ethereum
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:35:48
yes Bitcoin value is the protocol and its decentralized nature. as soon as Bitcoin becomes centralized.. most of its value disappear and any company can create its own bitcoin blockchain.. banks for example... that's the end game of central banks.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:53:21
its a pun.. to help spread the event.
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:18:52
in our case, mutability is the ability by consensus to roll back previous transactions. Ethereum did that after the DAO. On private blockchains it will be easier still.
The decentralization of Bitcoin prevents that.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:50:56
It will evovle as a banking standard store of value
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:33:40
lol.. pro fudder... go eat your bovine strat excrements.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:34:54
Bitcoin will go 100X when accepted as a defacto banking standard new gold standard 2.0
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:03:02
yep exactly. The Myth around Satoshi better be left unsolved. But I like the theory that Satoshi is a geeky former central banker 
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:10:15
well just go see what happened with the Status ICO. Now imagine many many live DAPPs running concurrently.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:42:10
Bitcoin will always be under attack. Remember always.
Stack and Hodl on a private wallet. They can't reach you. :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:31:58
Bitcoin is what it is. a decentralized database. Pay to write to it. The bitcoin tokens will be used for a new Banking Standard. The Bitcoin War has already begun. Chineese are trying to take over.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:32:22
i use SPV nodes only for pocket money.
You are an idiot and like all the noobs that only use Coinbase... SPV nodes are trusted 3rd parties. 
I send big checks with my own node. Satoshi said. Be your own bank. No trust.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:08:47
the worse thing in all this is that noobs are totally unable to use their own wallet on their own computers.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:24:43
i find suspicious all this energy spent to create a blocksize HF increase at all cost. Bitcoin is working fine.
BIP 148. NO hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:04:41
Washington propaganda crap. Not even reading the article. Flush Wapo down the toilet drain.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:43:13
download Bitcoin Core wallet, sync on the network and send your bitcoin there. If you are too dumb to do that, you shouldn't buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:28:30
no... they will stay around like evil minions to keep trying to push for bigger blocks. The powers that be will always try to centralize the Bitcoin Blockchain. They want total control.
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:52:40
I agree with you. Solidity cannot be proofed. Cannot trust contracts. Functional language was a better choice. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:50:51
have you tried synching the bitcoin network on a home computer lately? It takes hours just for a few days of block data.
Big blocks are going to kill home nodes.. killing bitcoin decentralization in the process.
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:10:33
why would you deposit BTC in a bank in the first place?
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:28:47
if Casper actually works in practice... kudos
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:18:11
blocks would still be full now and fees very high. They would ask for 8 mb blocks...
Making bitcoin even more centralized... until Bitcoin is de facto centralized and the FED controls the Bitcoin Master Key
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:03:28
Bitstamp ok. Never keep coins on exchanges anyways. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:46:07
because Obama.
Trump was right. China took the know-how and industrial capacity.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:48:19
the gov is smarter. overt actions would just make the community ask for a PoW change.
Overt actions are not necessary either. Bitcoin is still so small.
are you a noob?
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:17:37
so you mean that the key logger can record a live video of my 5 HD screens without me noticing it? as a dev, you know it is much harder. Also the NSA might be spying on me entering the code with a Samsung TV. Please code this little add on to enter letters on a virtual keyboard that can be moved over other screens.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:12:27
not real real time.. but time lag of 4 hours is reasonable.. even then Eth will fails if too many transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:07:23
so you 100% trust pruned nodes? Who gives you the pruned state?
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:18:46
watch Dogecoin being destroyed/centralized once people use the blockchain to store decentralized data.... there is no free lunch. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 20:24:43
how does Eth propagate with blocks every few seconds?
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:55:34


well Microsoft has a few distributed database that scale with technology and demand.. They are cheap.. Please contact their commercial rep.
@_date: 2013-09-18 20:41:59
i got out of gox mid august when price was 120 USD.
They are too amateurish. I lived the btc24 debacle. Trust your guts
@_date: 2013-08-26 18:32:04
Yesterday, I escaped through the BTC door with all my money and sent the BTC away from GOX.
Read the official document! GOX are amateurs. I don't trust them anymore. Fishy. I learned to recognize the signs and ACT upon them. (BTC24)
@_date: 2013-08-01 09:38:47
ad hominen and emotive language from 7 years old minds
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:18:53
CNN level of fakes news hahaha
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:59:03
what IRC program do you advice to use? I want to connect to BTC-24 IRC channel, but with a secure program without spyware that will try to key log and sniff my wallet.dat.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:46:56
depends on your point of view.
Scaling of a store of value or scaling DAPPs... When users want to use the DAPP and it is not responding... big fail. 
Wiring 50k USD with Bitcoin, you will easily make it to the next block by paying the fee.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:53:37
lol... Ether evaporates
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:02:58
my cash just got credited
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:57:02
I have just installed mIRC and I'm connected to  channel on freenodes.
kthx troll!
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:54:54
emotional liberals don't have patience.
@_date: 2017-06-27 07:30:09
if you don't own the whole blockchain you are are trusting someone else.
this goes against the essence of bitcoin. This is why blocks must be kept small.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:39:15
too many people looking for a price dip. myself included.
for a crash like in April, you would need an external factor like a DDOS attack. My bet, a DDOS on BTC China, currently the price driver.
