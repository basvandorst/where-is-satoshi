Not at the moment, but I might this winter or early next year. Definitely something that will come in future and there's no better place to start then in a side project :) 
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:14:59
Thanks for doing such fine ground work! :)
@_date: 2014-08-18 10:34:06
I'll add DKK for the next version.
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:03:41
The next version (that is soon ready for submission) will have an import and export feature. At the moment you can get the private key by enabling iCloud Keychain Sync and then look for an item named "bitstore". It's not ideal, but I'll submit the update soon.
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:11:40
Yes, sadly there's no way to do that. So when you install it from the AppStore all you can do is trust me + the review process from Apple. But you can build it yourself if you have an iOS developer account. And of course, people can contribute to the project.

I usually use Bitstamp, a SEPA transaction is free &amp; easy from here.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:24:19
Thanks :) No, just one address. But I'm looking into HD...
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:41:11
You only have to encrypt and send the private key. No information about your public address is available unless you have the password to decrypt it.
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:32:21
I'll probably do it as a setting, then everybody is happy.
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:01:46
That's why I'm so much happier using chain.com instead of the API from blockchain.info :)
@_date: 2014-10-20 12:09:19
Yeah you should never depend too much on one API ;) What's your app about?
@_date: 2014-06-26 11:32:33
I hope to submit the update this weekend.
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:11:19
new version includes pincode, private key export, push notifications - native, secure &amp; fast: 
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:49:30
Looks nice :) 
Here are just my two cents:
The back icon and hamburger icon are way to big. In the transaction history view try to align each column, it will look better if all addresses start at the same horizontal position. 
Usually Android drop down menus are indicated as three dots. With the hamburger icon the user expects a slide in menu. This is the correct way: 
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:18:09
Now supports private key export, pass-code and incoming push notification. BitStore has also been translated into Dutch, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Chinese and supports many new currencies.
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:00:53
Not in the initial version. The next version (that is soon ready for submission) will have an import and export feature. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:46:49
I had to deactivate the feature as there was too much misuse. Hope to have something similar back with the next update.
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:19:10
Yes I wrote it myself. I'm using the library CoreBitcoin which helps me create the address &amp; transactions. I created the initial version in under a week, as I wanted to be in the App Store as one of the first wallets. With all the updates I have done a lot more work. Hard to say how much, but usually a few hours in the evening and parts of the weekend.
Are you planning on making one too?
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:08:16
This is currently more of a test run, so we're selling bitcoins we already own. We are currently implementing a way to automatically buy the bitcoins from an exchange that offers an API.
@_date: 2014-10-09 08:47:47
This is indeed a bug, sorry for the inconvenience, I hope to get it fixed as soon as possible. In the list you see the public address, not the private key, this is to help you differentiate multiple keys.
@_date: 2014-07-30 12:50:09
Thanks, I'm hard at work implementing new features every day.
@_date: 2014-06-26 07:41:21
The next update will allow multiple addresses. Also a import / export / sweep feature. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:05:43
Um, strange that you got that message. I'll take a look at it :)
@_date: 2014-06-29 22:32:38
Cool! :) 0.01 BTC
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:44:09
Where's the acquisition?
@_date: 2014-09-27 21:15:27
Did you run 'pod install' like described in the README? You'll also have to return a valid API key in the File Keys.m, the others are optional.
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:55:17
Of course, not much I can do against that. But you can build it yourself if you have an iOS developer account. And of course, people can contribute to the project.
@_date: 2014-08-18 09:02:05
I just added the MIT License: 
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:15:45
Here's a new wife @_date: 2014-06-23 12:32:21
True, I'll add it to the todo list :)
@_date: 2014-06-26 07:38:03
I totally agree, that's why in the next update you'll be able to export the private key(s) yourself.
@_date: 2014-09-13 17:38:37
Thanks for using my app :)
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:52:04
As far as I know if multiple applications register for the same URI, it's undefined which app the system will open.
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:27:00
Try out mine ([BitStore]( I'm working hard on improvements every day, and always open to feedback.
@_date: 2014-07-19 07:46:29
Currently not. mBTC display is on the ToDo list, hope I'll find some time soon to implement it.
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:24:45
don't forget [BitStore]( :)
