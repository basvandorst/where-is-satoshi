USD is going up because other fiat currencies are being devalued like crazy. When USD collapses and there is nowhere else to go is when BTC will benefit.

Can you imagine what would happen to cryptos if there was a major problem with our telecoms network? Say a solar flare that damages electronics or mass unrest that physically damages the infrastructure. Even if it all got shut down for one reason or another? Not sayin its likely, just sayin....

Honestly if I had this amount, and wanted to sell them, I would be selling OTC, what is to gain from sending to the exchanges that could only absorb a tiny part of it without dramatically moving the market? it looks like a bluff to flush out the weak hands

you say that as if people dont buy more icecream on sunny days when they are more likely to go to the beach

perhaps not on an exchange but a private sale with nondisclosure would do it

yes, its a normal debit card, works the same as visa debit, i dont think you can use it for direct debits but i could be wrong

dont say anything then one day cruise up in a lambo with bitcoin plastered all over it and quit your job ��

The closest thing to this would be services such as the various bitcoin debit cards on offer, xapo for example

I personally believe that Bitcoin is never going to be "perfect" because the way mining uses such a huge amount of resources and the transaction rate is so bad, all of the proposed solutions just create more problems. If there is any hope of cryptos going really mainstream we need a completly new type of crypto. I subscribe to Nem, even just its massive transaction rate and scalability blows btc completly out of the water. I suggeust you look into it.
Edit: I might add that btc was a great proof of concept but its time to make way for the better tech
