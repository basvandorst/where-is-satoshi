It is easy to explain. BTC-e is market where you can easily deposit and withdraw cryptos, but it is very hard and cost a lot of money to do the same with FIAT. You don't have to be genius to know that if btc-e is isolated from FIAT it is not aligning so easy to other markets where FIAT is flowing without any cost and troubles.
You are talking about MtGox and this is good example. MtGox was isolated from FIAT and it was living its own life. Btc-e is not isolated completely but high cost of FIAT operation causing situation similar to MtGox.

Best answer for your question is another question. Why people prefer USD over other FIATs? Dolar is made from shity paper and its easy to falsify. On the other hand Polish Zloty is made in one of the best mint in the world but currency is worth shit.

Price goes down as most expected. New low is set on 320$. In next days this level probably will be tested.
