This is good news! A quick google revealed "fatwas" from what some of us affectionately call the "haram police" During the Islamic Golden Age, a lot of senior scholars were polymaths and would have totally understood the Bitcoin protocol inside out before returning a verdict. It's embarrassing that some of prominent modern clerics base their fatwas on heresay and half-truths. One of them quipped that Bitcoin must be haram (forbidden) because it can be used to pay for haram things. Since Muslims have to apologise for almost everything nowadays (terrorism etc), let me also apologise for our half-wit 'scholars' and their fatwas :)
