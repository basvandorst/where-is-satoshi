Have you ever sold? buying in at different price points is a good strategy IMO

Honestly this is so true...

This definitely puts it into perspective...it goes from being nearly impossible to impossible when you take out the hackers motive for even TRYING to guess a private key. Especially if the largest wallets spread out their wealth between multiple key pairs.

I don't get it

Thats exactly what I was referring to but didn't know how many people on this sub would get the reference haha

Definitely, it would be way easier for someone to obtain your private key through your digital footprints. I was mostly interested in if a hacker was to brute force it.

Yea it's what I used as well, took my transaction like a week and a half I think. The only thing you should worry about is if you want to sell right away. If you are going to HODL then I wouldn't worrry.

Maybe just invest a little now? Then if it dips invest the actual amount you planned? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:37:21
I think she touched on that briefly
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:03:48
Do you have any numbers or data on it? Like you would have to guess x number of keys and each key takes x number of seconds/minutes to guess?

Thanks for giving your viewpoint on this! It's cool hearing educated opinions on this for a change.

You are locked in at that price don't worry, it just takes some time depending on what site you are using.

Is a simple bank deposit enough for record purposes? Or do I need to like take screenshots of transactions on gdax or other trading sites used?
