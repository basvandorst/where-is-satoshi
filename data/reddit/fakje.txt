If i remember correctly, Danny said in the btt thread it didn't work yet, but would symbolize bitcoin's network nodes.

If you are on windows, there's a keepass 2 extension which allow to store seeds &amp; generate tokens.

I should contact my journalist friend and tell her to write some article on me..
Joke aside, good initiative !
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:10:33
We don't.
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:51:39
Do you really believe we won't see any asic worms in the future ? Do you really believe corrupted mining softwares will cease to exist by sticking to bitcoin ?
And on the other hand (for Julian702), bitcoin mining is not the only incentive/use for botnets..

And i guess i'm not the only one involved in bitcoins and others crypto-currencies for some time, but who never had the need to create an account on bitcointalk. 
Damn me lurker !

I don't want to make you paranoid but don't forget the javascript code embedded in an image linked in btce's trollbox which basicly used ajax requests to withdraw your funds if you were logged in..

Done, thx !

I agree, you obviously shouldn't except for day-trading, or if trying to buy when prices are going downward.
I just noticed the message today, and as i didn't saw it on reddit, i though it could be usefull for some fellows.
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:45:36
support should work.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:46:35
 ?
(I've tested method 2 &amp; 3).
FYI, some password managers allow storing of 2fa seeds, and generation of codes. This way, even if you lose your smartphone, you'll still be able to connect to your 2fa enabled website !

Using a bank isn't really a choice in all country if you want to live by society's rules. 
Here in France, only a hobbo can live without a bank account. It sadly became mandatory for quite every administrative procedure, and god knows we love'em (paychecks, medical insurrance, taxes, etc...).

Doubtful business model with "No warranties" and "Limitations of liability". (
I wouldn' touch it with a stick.

You have to consider that :
* bitcoin mining reward halved
* Bitcoin as a payment system is way more accepted/recognized
* The world economic context evolved
* the 2011 experience teach people that making a loss as of today doesn't imply making a loss 2 years from now

On Windows do Alt + 3647 (on pavnum). 
Note : it doesn't work on Reddit ("?" char instead) , you've got to do it elsewhere and copy paste. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:30:21
Shhh, they could read you !

It's a shame you weren't more specific since it's exactly OP's question (missing the true meaning/loosely defined terms).
@_date: 2013-03-11 19:30:18
Does it also apply to europe ?
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:17:01
There was only one person who had 2FA enabled, and it was on withdraw (not login).
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:30:59
Amazing ! Good job guys, i'll give it a look ! :)

I also noticed on google trends that our chinese friends show some noticeable interest in Ripple.

Also, since they mostly use Baidu, i suggest watching Baidu index in the days ahead

Ripple will be doing a xrp giveaway next weeks. I would love to see p2p's exchanges take off, 'cause we have way too many problems  with traditional centralized market places. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 12:35:36
I second that. I thought BitcoinTip bot on xda-developers would be great ! :)

Why not try to sell some ? Print a board, and spread the word !

It won't allow you to buy bitcoin now, but it may play a role in bringing bitcoins to the mass.
See the thread at bitcointalk, on havelock, or search reddit for more info.

Don't confuse governments with citizens.
Old politicians who don't understand a shit in anything computer related and powerfull cultural lobbies are enough to make shitty (and useless) laws and look reluctant at an international scale, but this doesn't imply us being against innovations !
We are one of the best country in the world for internet bandwidth, territorial accessibility and costs (~30€ / month for internet &gt;= 18 Mo/s unlimited without fair use + television over adsl + phone unlimited to mobiles, and the same for ~15€ without tv).
Administrative burden kill most of the entrepeneur's motivations/trials in the nest, but we are pretty heavy consumers for anything high tech and innovative.
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:53:08
Government doesn't mandatory mean capitalist, you know.
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:08:30


As a european I strongly disagree. Many of us are school teached with British spellings, but are exposed to American spellings through tv shows, songs, and cultural radiance. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:34:48
It can only be usefull ! 
I also try to have accounts on several platforms, so if shit hits the fan on one, it's not too bad (and sadly bitcoin exchanges tend to have problems and disappear).
About Bitcoin-Central, I used to use them before they were hacked. 
Top notch quality service and honest people (they paid with their own funds for the stolen bitcoins). 
The only issue you will face using them is volume, but you're aware of that.
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:00:03
Conspiracy, everywhere !
Sidenote: I agree with China hoarding USD and struggling to keep the renminbi undervaluated, and i too wonder why they would want to "push[ing] the USD into irrelevancy".

If you want to trade with it, there's also bitfinex.

The difficulty is indeed reevaluated. Not in a timeframe but every X new blocks found (2 thousands and nuts i believe). 
What may change concerning mining is the renewed competition between asics manufacturers/retailers.
Remember the american gold rush ? The pickaxe makers did better than most of the seekers.

I'm into software, and i don't know much about hardware design.
I was asking myself : how hard would it be to buy one asic and do some reverse engeneering ?
I know what a chip looks like, no doubt it would need many knowledge, skills and tools, but is it that hard to do ?
