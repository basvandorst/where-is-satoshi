Exactly what my reply was going to be. If you aren't savvy enough to put a simple wrapper script/alias/modify the shortcut args, you need to use a different wallet. Maybe electrum.

Beautiful work. Really like the classic style with a modern flair. I'll give you 2btc for the car!

Not saying you're wrong or that I don't believe you, but you did paint a pretty good picture of your background. While there are probably a lot of people doing this research, if it comes out that someone leaked this, they will use this info to figure out who you are. Regardless of whether you violated an NDA, they will make things hell.

I'm not a lawyer, but why would it be? You moved your own property from one "location" you own to another.

Having a free plan does not make it "free, period" for a company, especially larger corporations. You still have to integrate it into your process, and that comes at a cost.
Also the free plan doesn't seem to come with guaranteed support. That's a big issue for larger corporations, meaning they'd have to pay for one of the better plans.

Ok, your first article points to a brute force attack, which is possible through most services. Are there ways to help mitigate it? Sure. But that doesn't necessarily protect people using weak passwords in the first place.
The next two articles you posted are from six freaking years ago, when Safari for Windows was relatively new. Basically you're cherry-picking a few times when Apple rolled out some buggy infrastructure and trying to use them as examples why Apple isn't above average in security. I'm not trying to back up that claim, just pointing out your logic here isn't really sound.

Actually I believe that's how companies like the Humble store procure their Steam keys. They buy a bulk of Steam keys for wholesale prices, then sell the keys for the same price as Steam charges (not counting sales). Lets the resellers make a profit, Steam still sells games and pulls people into their ecosystem.

Worked for me just a few minutes ago. Did you verify your email?

Ahh, my bad. It's been a month or two since I bought last. Guess I missed that development.
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:22:37
That is an awful, awful idea. You have to verify your email, and will most likely raise a bunch of red flags. Don't abuse a generous gift and risk everything.

You do realize that viruses have to be discovered by security labs before your AV will check for it, right? This would wreak havoc in the meantime.

You do realize those companies aren't holding BTC either right? They convert directly to USD. Doesn't matter to them what the exchange rate is, they get $$$ at the end. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 23:11:33
It's not actually impossible, you just need to launch armory with either a wrapper script or an alias.

Just use Gyft to by Zeevex cards to buy Steam credit. I realize this isn't ideal, but it's 100% legit and works pretty instantly.

If I understand the process correctly, I don't think the retailers buy the keys from Valve (unless they're selling Valve games). Steam doesn't even technically generate the codes; they get them from the game publishers. The publishers then sell wholesale keys to other distributors.

If you think their own private datacenter wouldn't have similar backdoors, you're fooling yourself. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:29:31
Yeah. All of the points about a rogue employee are pretty much nullified by Amazon's security practices. Trust me, $5m is low compared to the worth of other data on the systems. Employees with physical access to the DC have no access to the software, and employees with access to the software have no access to the DC. Amazon also doesn't store your keys for you unless you use their HSM, in which case they'd be encrypted again by a key you control. 
Pretty frustrating fighting this FUD about the cloud.

When law enforcement is involved, they probably have to coordinate the seizure between executive management, and various hardware and software admin teams. Everything would be documented and logged. It would be near impossible to get machines out of their infrastructure unnoticed. It would be far more likely to happen if bitstamp hosted their own infrastructure and had a rogue employee or if they used a Colo facility.

I don't think implying they're involved in illegal activity when corresponding with the individual is libel... I would think that statement would have to be publicly made to count as libel.

Ahh my bad! I thought you really didn't know. Get a lot of people here who don't know anything about BTC...
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:00:27
I'm not so sure that's security through obscurity. Bitcoin has been making waves for the better part of a year now, and really bright minds have already taken an interest in it. While there may be even more people looking at double-spend attacks, I'm not convinced some genius is going to figure out a sure fire way of causing one. Far more likely for it to be accidental IMO.

The more investment there is, the less volatility there will be. As the value goes up, it takes much larger transactions to affect price as much. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:28:17
I'm not so sure. Again you're talking about a target audience which tends to be... Not so bright. The double-spend attacks I would think are going to go for larger targets. Not some tools or a new tv. Too much effort for such small reward when conversion is a lot simpler. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:09:51
That is a legitimate concern. We've already seen monumental growth of the blockchain over the past year, and it's not entirely clear what the solution to that problem will be. Solutions have been proposed such as blockchain compression and only storing a certain number of transactions on clients, but ultimately some hosts will have to have an unadulterated, entire history of the blockchain.
As for when the last blockchain is mined, that's what transaction fees are for. The video mentions that "miners" (or at that point, verification servers since there's really no more "mining" to be done) would still do the same work they do now, but would just receive the transaction fees from the block rather than a full BTC as their reward. There is still incentive, and depending on the scale of the bitcoin economy at the time, the incentive could be quite large.
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:40:52
Yeah there are quite a few things wrong with this comparison. 
* Bitcoin projects are typically open-source by nature, so have a high likelihood of showing up on GitHub.
* Most development around PayPal/Stripe are probably on closed-source store backends - not as likely to show up on GitHub. 
* Numbers don't seem to differentiate between new projects and forked projects.
* Bitcoin needs development for the network, mining, and payment processing while PayPal/Stripe only really involve payment processing on the developer side.

Ugh. It's not assumed. It is law that the restaurant has to make up for the difference if the server doesn't make at least minimum wage. Quite spreading this crap that tipping is mandatory. If your employer doesn't make up the difference, you have a legal right to sue them.

In addition to post below, there's also the fact that only the OS is open sourced on most Android devices. There are additional microcontrollers and processors on those devices which are not open source, such as the cell transceivers. These can be compromised and nobody would know it, since the firmware for these is generally proprietary and closed.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:36:50
Yup that's why they use a weighted average that sits on the lower end of the exchange prices. If they used something like mtgox they'd be risking a lot more and see a lot more volatility. It's why I prefer watching bitpays price because it fluctuates a little less.
