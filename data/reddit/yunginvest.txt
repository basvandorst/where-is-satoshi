It does but the balances for each party are not completely settled and finalised until the channel is shut

My exit point is honestly going to be 500,000 USD - I truly believe we will hit that point in the not too distant future

If I have learnt one thing... DO NOT TRY TO DAY TRADE, DO NOT SELL.
ONLY HODL.

That was fun, time to start up again! 20k HERE WE COME :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:29:44
I'd say it's pretty much done, we've almost halved and seem to have a strong support at 12k

HELLO FREE BITCOIN
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:26:45
lol'd at this last comment
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:08:06
Cryptos will be adopted globally. I'm going to put most of my money into BTC and other alts as I truly believe they hold huge value.

I was watching when that happened, crazy! Literally dropping by $10 every buy/sell that popped up

GDAX is built by the creators of coinbase, it's less user friendly (for more serious trading I guess), but it's cheaper than using coinbase.

Personally I would just buy it online :)
You normally only need  to provide a picture of you with your ID and transfer some money through via credit card (if you're in the US), or SWIFT transfer.
I used Independent Reserve, hope that helps :)

If you're going to use coinbase, then use GDAX, they charge less for transaction fees etc.
Personally I haven't been investing in crypto for very long, but right now could be the last chance to own a bitcoin before it sky-rockets to the moon (or it might not).
The way I see it, is that you may invest 6 - 7k and that is the most you could potentially lose, but the most you could potentially gain is limitless

I just looked into this and saw it as well!
That's like 100 million dollars just sitting there waiting on a buy
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:30:36
Yup didn't end up happening since I posted this! Last night was pretty crazy, dropped almost a thousand dollars and then recovered within 2 or 3 hours. I missed the short :(
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:22:45
Hark that is a fantastic story, and I'm super happy life's working out for you! Good stuff
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:09:52
Probably not but we will see a lot of money move into BCH I think
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:40:11
Whatever percentage the market goes down, is the percentage of money you lose. If BTC goes from 1,000 to 900, you've lost 10%. You might have had $5000 WORTH of BTC, so that will go down to $4500. Then the next day if it goes down from 900 to say $600, you've lost another 33% of your $4500 you had.

Looking at the bittrex charts, we dipped to $6800 but it seems to be going back up over 7k again rapidly
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:19:19
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:31:44
Maybe not...
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:09:06
Great idea!
Just invest however much you're comfortable with losing I guess!
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:00:49
Didn't break it on Bitrrex either but I'm thinking it will in the next 12 hours!
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:31:20
Disagree with disagreement.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:31:37
Crazy how easily it can be manipulated
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:59:03
Bitcoin is changing lives and that's why I like it
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:04:45
Why is the herd coming on Dec 10th OP?
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:29:32
Hahaha! My bad, habitual thing to do living in New Zealand ;)
