Puh 90.000 unconfirmed transactions with 50k of them over 50 sats per byte.
Acouple days ago I could get 2 sat byte transactions confirmed.
Over 700 people paying &gt; 400 sat byte this is insane \^\^
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:31:12
Almost 100k unconfirmed transactions. Only 40k of them is maybe spam the rest has significat fees...

Where is the problem just spend 2 sat then. I did some bech32 migrations with 3 sats. Worked fine.

You will have the seed words which you write down by hand and never touch a pc.
@_date: 2019-07-28 11:20:54
So you promote not paying taxes...

Get them a Segwit address
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:53:19

Realtime is gambling anyway...

I never used the service but created an account. There is one eure cent in it. I can't close the account and the minimum to withdraw is 15 cent...

No app in European version from Samsung...
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:07:20
Same goes for Europe at least Samsung Germany.

Zu teuer. 1 Prozent Gebühren bei Kauf und Verkauf dann noch der versteckte Zuschlag durch zu niedrige oder zu hohe Preise.
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:21:06
Or maybe fix ipv6 to make it dual stack.
@_date: 2019-02-26 01:57:03
This includes a lot of moving around for new address format or wallets. So you can't really compare it... Also a lot of exchange to and from fiat. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 05:48:37
Hardware wallet... 
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:20:34
Thinking of adding elextrumx does anyone know current size this adds? Also need to look into lighting installed eclair on mobile so far... 
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:27:53
It was not even mentioned 
@_date: 2019-02-08 10:34:20
Did not get past cookie policy :)

Ledger S with 2nd PIN, also don't write down password or keep it at least away from seed.

Here  you can get an idea of the fees in mempool. Also Electrum allows to set them as you like.
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:33:59
So will the seed be backed up to Samsung cloud as I read somewhere? 
@_date: 2019-04-28 10:34:18
If you gain 601 you have to pay tax for 601 not just for 1 Euro :)
I use the electrum freeze function to lock newly bought coins away for 1 year. In conjunction with a leger nano s.
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:43:14
This is still very dangerous it might go down. Just be prepared and don't over extend.
@_date: 2019-09-09 05:57:35
This is stupid sorry. This shows what? Moved to segwit and native segwit. Moved to claim shit coins.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:53:27
Same here using Electrum on offline pc for gold and 2x forks.
After that ledger with 2x again.

It would be no cold wallet but maybe a more secure hot one. Also nice to have... 
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:12:44
There is only one wallet type and it is called hardware wallet... Maybe play with others with small amounts.
@_date: 2019-05-18 05:10:46

Hype cycle... 
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:06:58
Would recommend Linux and a openvpn or VPN on a router... 
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:59:29
Used that too. But I guess all other coins are worthless not to say they had value...
