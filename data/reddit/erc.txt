If you're a tech idiot, your best bet is to leave the coin on Coinbase. This means you are accepting 'exchange risk' but it's preferable to the other risks you open yourself up to given your lack of tech literacy. Not your keys; not your Bitcoin is for people willing to do the work.

There is an input that has incredibly strong correlation with price.
It’s is called stock-to-flow. SF is how we quantify scarcity. And the analyst who discovered this correlation has shown that BTC can be expressed as a power law using one input, SF. Furthermore, his regression has a rather staggering r^2 of 95.

Everyone does not assume what you say about stock to flow. Literally PlanB who wrote the model you are referring to, says the opposite. He basically says, “what happens after BTC SF goes above 62 is anyone’s guess because it’s uncharted territory.”
Re: your questions built on that incorrect characterization...
-	Golds liquidity has not dried up due to it having a SF massively higher than anything else on earth.
-	In the year 2140, lol. Fees are expected to take the place of the reward. Even communist China doesn’t bother much with planning beyond five years out. Relax.
-	Your last question makes the mother of all errors amounts to “could there be something better.” The answer is without a doubt a YES. But who cares. That’s meaningless.

I don’t see any reason for why bitcoin can’t be allowed to become the “store of value” people see it for. Just because Satoshi called it P2P cash doesn’t mean it has to be.
So many people want to force the “currency” aspect when it behaves like anything but a true currency.
I am so confused by how a real person, in 2017, who actually pays their taxes, would see utility in day to day spending of bitcoin.
It’s digital gold. This has been clear for quite some time. I get that many disagree, but I’m honestly flummoxed by it. Insane volatility, General and severe appreciation in value, cumbersome transactions, these do not make for a good currency. Yes it can be used as such in edge cases, a la drugs via internet and USPS. But so many seem to think this is heading towards daily use. I don’t see it.

His concern is that the less reputable (less liquid) clearing members will be incentivized to offer appetizing margin rates. What then happens is that a few of these weaker members go bust but they spell disaster for all of the clearing members who are on the hook for the absurd risk the shit clearing members took on. Exactly as outlined in his open letter. It’s not surprising that his firm under his direction is only going to offer the longs. This is all going to get very interesting very quickly.

Purchases with bitcoin are, per IRS guidance, the same as a conversion to USD. There is not a grey area here. Just FYI.
E.g. — you have one BTC with cost basis of 1k. You purchase a car with 1BTC when its USD quoted value at the time of the transaction is 10K. You have 9K in capital gain you must pay tax on. If you held it for longer than one year it is subject to the long term rate.
Bonus content: the same also applies for trading across alts. No like kind exemption exists currently. RIP your accountant if you *daytrade* crypto. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 21:07:07
I'm curious about this 'lost forever' idea. Won't coins held beyond certain lengths of time become cryptographically insecure at a certain point due to advances in computing power. Won't keys held in really old wallets become vulnerable to attack and thus reintroduction to the market at some point based on advances in technology. If that happens it could provide a more natural mechanism of reintroducing those 'lost' coins back into the ecosystem.

Behavior like this is important and commendable. While there is still a ton of chaff in this thread I am happy to see the level of discourse being kept to a certain standard and by a consequential player no less. Thank you.
I'm far less concerned about the substance of the blocksize 'debate' than I am about the level of discourse surrounding it. Perhaps this is because I am a non-technical long term holder. I see failure for all in the community to act like adults as the greatest threat to BTC. I appreciate a simple statement like yours where you accept being held to your own standard. If more and more could just act like this we would be well on our way to resolving through compromise.

So since you are looking to gift it as a surprise I think what may work best is for you to create a wallet. Probably a paper wallet. Transfer the gifted amount into this wallet. Then simply send in an email the blockchain.info links to both the TX and the Wallet Address and a nice message explaining what the two show. Also explain that you cannot safely send them the private key via email. But offer to send it in the mail or hold onto until you see them in person next. As with all paper wallet gifts. Keep a copy or a backup for your own records in case the original is lost by the recipient down the road.

Not really. There may be some blacklisted sites. That I am unsure of. However, if you are planning to spend them on illicit drugs or the like, you would be wise to not do so directly from Coinbase.

The world runs on dollars, it just does, and counter to the sentiments expressed by *crypto-enthusiasts* it works pretty darn well too.

I think that his reasoning is very fair. He simply has a lifetime of experience that shows him that things which threaten government power end up being destroyed by government. So really I do not see why people reject this criticism. Its fine to disagree and think that BTC will overcome. But he's not an idiot/shill/etc. for pointing out that a non governmental currency faces many hurdles from government.
To me, posts like this and others where excessive use of the term 'fiat' proliferate in the comments highlight that pockets of this community need to grow up a little bit.

I wouldn't put much in the predictions. But I think it's fair to assess the following:
A Bitcoin ETF would open bitcoin up to a large pool of investors who have not felt comfortable buying BTC outright. It is not unreasonable to think that such an opening would cause price movements.

Spurring creative thinking is one benefit wrought by limitations. But you outline one possible downside as well.

In theory and in practice the ETF will trade correlated to the underlying asset, which in this case is BTC.
COIN does not have to and almost certainly will not trade 1:1 with BTC. So it could be a 10:1 or something like that.
While COIN will be a security it is incorrect to refer to it as a stock. It will not be splitting or anything like that.
You can find basically any answer to all of these questions by reading a few paragraphs about the first Gold ETF. Basically COIN is going to go through all of that. GLD

Right. But 25% of federal budget goes to Medicare and related programs so... cross off health from your list. Roads, well not as big and impressive of a round number percentage but still undeniable that large federal monies go there. Nevermind the state and municipal taxes that deal with all non fed highways. Oh and schools, well, that's typically funded primarily by your local taxes with help from Feds. So it appears that the Taxes you don't want to pay do fund the things you care about. I guess it's not so much that they don't fund the things that you care about, and more the fact that you just don't know much about taxes.
None of which is to deny that federal spending on the "war machine" is out of control. Just that them "put[ting] it all into the war machine" is an oversimplification you tried using to justify being a proud tax cheat. Or should I say wannabe tax cheat, because I suspect your ignorance of taxation stems for never having filed before.

Bitcoin community ought to stop trying to sell it as a currency for the moment. Transacting in Bitcoin is neither easy in the moment nor easy in the long term. The tax headache is absurd and renders it useless as true currency. This may change down the road. But so many bitcoiners refuse to accept this present reality. Instead Bitcoin, imo ought be sold as the store of value it is, one which can see parabolic upward and downward movements. It's use as a speculative asset is essentially unparalleled. Market it for what it is, not for the words printed on the whitepaper or what many of us want it to be someday. I 'marketed' Bitcoin to several family members at Christmas by explaining that those little pieces of paper I gave them last year have almost tripled in value.
Give someone 10 bucks worth of Bitcoin today. Return in a year. Rinse and repeat with others. Y'all have done the best marketing in the world.

I appreciate this post for its title. Good to know that number.
Edit: although your initial rant on Twitter shares outstanding makes me think I should check your math. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:30:06
Waste of money. Big numbers will cause the issue to be addressed. Even if you dumped the entire market cap of BTC into such an endeavor like you propose it would accomplish little or nothing. Instead allow Bitcoin price to grow steadily and the wealth generated will become incentive enough for it to be addressed. Perhaps not in the way twenty something anarchists want, but it will be addressed. The government has no trouble writing rules when the numbers get big enough.
Bigger issue IMO is how this community seems to hold two very conflicting ideas. To the moon on one hand, and using Bitcoin as currency. An ever appreciating asset is useless as a standard unit of account. If Bitcoin performs like say Berkshire Class A shares it stands to reason it will be traded similarly which is to say thinly. I'm all for Bitcoin. But peer to peer money it does not seem it will be. Why the fuck would I spend Bitcoin when it's so volatile. Why would I as a merchant accept bitcoin when it's so volatile even if generally upward.
Don't get me wrong, I hope we do continue to see big swings but I'm not foolish enough to try and reconcile "to the moon" and "can I pay for that coffee with Bitcoin." Nor do I know which will win out. I just know that I hold Bitcoin and have no real interest in spending it.
@_date: 2016-12-22 12:27:03
Ignore that pedantry above. There is no BTC ETF and so far as we know the Winklevii are the closest. However it is unlikely we will see approval anytime soon. See history of first Gold ETF for a lesson in how long regulators can drag their heels.
As to your initial question. A Bitcoin ETF would certainly cause a flurry of activity. As the ETF will attract a lot of interest from traditional investors who heretofore have been unwilling to signup with unknown entities like Coinbase etc. nevermind the fact that anyone who wants to long term hold should be doing so in a retirement account (think IRA) and one can imagine that the first ETF will near instantly become the largest holder of Bitcoin. 
Overall, regulators unlikely to approve in my opinion. But if or when they do, that ETF will balloon and the price of BTC will as well. It'll be good to allow mainstream investors a way to buy into Bitcoin.

Yes but you don't go into Starbucks and say I'd like to pay for this coffee with 1 share of SPY out of my brokerage account. Also oh great so Coinbase may provide better reports tracking in the near future. I hope so. But that's just a hope nothing more. This is a reporting nightmare compared to what typical brokerage houses do now because of the example above. The one reason it's not a total disaster is because practically no one uses Bitcoin the way so many claim to here on Reddit. It's not a currency.
If Bitcoin is the majority of your holdings so much so that you need to use it instead of dollars for day to day purchases, well, you are all in my friend and that is not good I'm afraid. But the rallies will have convinced you that it's fine, so I won't try to convince you otherwise.

Since you are posting re: lost coins I'm curious about your thoughts re: their resurrection.
My understanding is that lost coins can be expected to be recovered at some point when things like quantum computing enables their recovery. Is this completely inaccurate. It may seem ridiculous but we are talking about an experiment that issues digital tokens until the year 2140. So with a timeline like that it doesn't feel too silly to entertain ideas like this. Curious if you have any knowledge about something like this and what your thoughts are. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:11:37
I'm by no means an expert but I believe this to be incorrect. Sure an ETF can throw off dividends if the underlying asset does so. But since Bitcoin does not as disclosed above, the BTC ETF will not. Happy to be corrected. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:49:48
I'm doubtful it will be approved under present or near term conditions. That's not to say I think it will never be approved. I just think it's highly unlikely as things stand now. So I'd not be willing to make a prediction beyond "I doubt approval is coming."
All of that said, I hope I am wrong. A Bitcoin ETF will be perhaps the most momentous occasion short of the white paper itself for Bitcoin.
Edit: in my opinion the Winklevii or whoever ought to target a non-US exchange that is still globally legitimate. I also exclude Chinese because well China and as an American I'd hate to see China gain even more purchase over the system. So my recco would be TSX the Toronto Stock Exchange.

This. Bitcoin, at present is completely unusable as a means of payment. The only folks who make claims of using bitcoin as a form of payment have an anarchistic view towards taxation. Look at Bitcoin as a cyber bond whose yields accrue within the asset itself. Presently it is nothing more than a store of value. It may someday be a currency but that day appears nowhere in sight.
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:49:34
Right I have one. First why on earth would I spend something that's appreciated whatever Bitcoin has in the past year. Second the Shift Card still has the main issue re: taxable gains. Even though it can do the calculations for you. I'm looking at an extra taxable event every time I purchase a latte.
Edit: Bitcoin isn't a currency according to the government. And like it or not, until the gov't says it is or "fiat" itself becomes obsolete Bitcoin will not be useful as a day to day currency for purchasing coffee.

It’s somewhat unclear what you mean due to phrasing. But Let’s start with your first question. The CME contracts are going to be cash settled.
Regarding risk, the biggest risk, imo, was properly identified by Interactive Brokers Chairman. 
See [this video]( but to sum it up: it’s not so much that futures for crypto are themselves, on their own too dangerous. It’s that they ought not to be commingled with the traditional futures market due to the extreme volatility. 
If BTC moons and the futures contract locks limit-up day after day after day, the liabilities created for the clearing members could represent an existential threat to the clearinghouse as a whole. And as he says, that could take down the entire economy.

Plenty of folks from the “olden days” have seen BTC as a store of value and not as peer-to-peer digital cash. I count myself amongst them. You’re noticing trends that don’t actually exist in order to reinforce your own worldview.
Anyone with substantive knowledge of crypto’s tax treatment understands that it’s not feasible for use as peer-to-peer digital cash. Being subject to capital gains tax for every purchase is a far bigger problem than the fees that you exaggerate or outright misunderstand.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:39:59
I suggest watching the video. He took out out a full page ad in the WSJ to explain why this is dangerous (not to BTC but to the traditional markets) and in the video he explains his rationale for the average joe who would be watching TV.

Bitcoin as payment network has a much larger hurdle imposed on it from the outside. A big bad centralized entity  (/ s) known as the United States Government does not consider cryptocurrencies, currencies. As such, it is subject to capital gains taxation and useless (to law abiding citizens) for commerce.
Sure, most bitcoiners aren’t aware of this. And of those that are, still many just think they can ignore this fact. But as this digital gold continues to appreciate in value, the tax man is going to get quite zealous about getting his due.

Quantum computing isn’t some innovation that just occurs and suddenly the world is changed across the board. Quantum processing will be achieved in very specific domains little by little.
As such your question is really, is SHA-256 gonna be vulnerable under a quantum regime. The answer is fuck yes, at some point.
But the real answer is, don’t fucking worry about it. All of the worlds cryptographic standards will theoretically be vulnerable under a quantum reordering, so there’s gonna be much bigger problems. And most importantly, it won’t all happen at once. It will be a slow process.

Purchasing creates a taxable event.
When you own BTC and it appreciates but you don’t cash out, it’s not taxed. It’s only when you cash out that capital gains kicks in. This is why purchasing with BTC on day to day is foolish. Even with spend and replace. You are creating a tax nightmare.
But this sub usually hand waves with, “why pay taxes.” Lol

I doubt it will do 85% down as it has done in the past. But I don’t see why a 50% drop would be off the table. The infrastructure has matured a little since the days of 85% down moves. But the influx of noobs makes anything possible. A move to the downside will cascade. These new folks expect profit and will end up selling when a substantial move in the other direction happens. This will feed on itself.

You will find his unsatisfactory. But here goes.
No, you and Peterffy don’t agree. Your entire post is premised on the notion that no one will take the shorts initially (“only an idiot would do so”).
He does not state this. In fact he states quite the opposite in his letter.
In a few weeks you will see plenty of people “take the shorts” and many will do so with the weakest clearing members. This is the crux of the issue. This was not addressed in your post at all. So please stop deluding yourself into thinking you were stating what Peterffy was. Just because you both referenced a lock limit ups does not make your points the same.
I don’t really care to argue with you over the rest of it. You understand derivatives. I don’t deny it, Good for you. I just think it’s not as simple as you state.
For one thing, I don’t agree that no one will take on the shorts when CME opens this contract. Furthermore, I don’t agree that “no clearing house would do this,” primarily because we are seeing exactly the opposite occur.
The lower tier members of the clearing house are chomping at the bit for this and are preparing to offer perverse and inflammatory incentives to their customers. 
And this is what presents an existential threat.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:30:14
I don’t have time to link. But if you read the contracts proposed specs; the holding limits (how many lots a single entity can buy) are, in the beginning, going to be very modest.
I believe it was 25 lots, if I’m recalling correctly. Which is effectively 125 BTC. Since the contract will represent 5 BTC.
I’m not disagreeing with your comment entirely. Just pointing out that it’s not as simple as one might think.
Limiting how much exposure players can have is quite common practice for new derivative listings. And it’s certainly a good idea with BTC where fair market valuation is well, a nightmare, to put it mildly.

Seems a strange reaction. He just switched his firms stance from one of out and out opposition to “yes we are going to try and offer trading for BTC and it’s derivatives.” As per his CNBC interview this evening.
With regards to this letter, he brings up incredibly valid points. Segregating BTC derivatives from traditional derivatives is a good idea, the threat of contagion is huge. But what would he know, he’s just one of the foremost derivatives experts in the world.

I mean, I just think the sentiments expressed are deeply troubling.
Even your reply plays a part in it. This "one of us" mentality is deeply troubling.
I got into it for ideological reasons when I was a young man smitten by people like Ron Paul. I had little to lose back then. I'm older now, a whole lot less of an ideologue, and more grown up. And until you book em, paper profits are just that.
I've made no decision as of yet. But if we start to really spike out of control and I keep hearing sentiments like yours, I'm tempted.
I didn't join a cult. Besides, I've never been one to "trade" as it were. But I suspect that if true mania arrives, I'll be able to buy back my core position at more sane levels.

You can cheat on your taxes if you wish, that’s entirely up to you. Doing so on a public, immutable ledger is not the smartest idea imo. But hey. You do you.
The answer to your broader question is simple. When you convert your BTC into USD, or anything else for that matter (real estate, cocaine, or lap dances); the capital gain you have at the time of those transactions is subject to being taxed at either the short or long term rate depending on how long you held the investment.
Bitcoin is not a currency according to the entities that get to decide whether it is or not in the world as it exists today. It is an investment subject to capital gains taxation every step of the way. Realize a gain, pay that tax. This is how it works being upper middle class in America. Write your congressman if you don’t like it. Until then, please pay the taxes you owe. Thank you.

It depends on what you want. Antonoupolos if you want deeper technical understanding. Saifedean if you want deeper philosophical understanding.
I recommend Saifedean because in my experience practically no one, even in this sub has read it. People seem blissfully unaware of concepts like unforgeable costliness and stock-to-flow. Which is batshit insane, call it r/gatekeeping but you simply do not understand Bitcoin in the least if you do not have a deep understanding of those concepts and the broader history of money.
Saifedean can fix that for you if you read his book.
If you haven’t read Saifedean you might actually think that someday you will be using Bitcoin to pay for coffee (it’s all about adoption bro). Ugh
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:54:31
I was being a jerk. Sorry.
Bitcoin is not a transactional currency that people are going to use to buy coffee with. It’s not a network like the internet subject to metcalfes law.
Bitcoin is money in the traditional sense. Think gold. It is an incredibly “hard” money and it gets harder every four years. Relatively soon, the measure of its hardness will surpass that of Gold. Making it the hardest money on earth.
People buying and hoarding it are classical savers. Bitcoin enables savings by way of a sound money instrument. That it can be transmitted over a communications channel is an enormous advantage.
The reason is that, you and I could fund democratic uprisings in China (were they not predisposed to wear the yoke) if we wanted to, by sending digital gold thru a communications channel. Or reverse it, a wealthy entrepreneur in Venezuela could actually escape his socialist homeland with his wealth. Whereas with gold it would be hard to not face confiscation.

Sorry. I don’t do price predictions. I have no idea.
I’ll say this, since you’re new to BTC. The volatility is going to be insane. We are at the All Time High and frankly mania is setting in. Buy whatever you buy but commit to holding it for at least a year. Be prepared to see a 40% downturn. Ya need to be prepare for upside and downside equally. You’re here cause you caught the glimmer of the upside. And hey. That can happen. It very well might. But exactly the opposite is just as likely. If you commit to holding what you purchase for a longer period of time, you will weather some of the volatility.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:23:24
If it’s a sizable amount of money I strongly suggest consulting an accountant. I have not cashed out the majority of my holdings. However I did move a little bit around and into alts this summer.
Because it’s looking like I will someday (soon, even though I can’t believe it still) be very much in the radar of the IRS, I have chosen to turn over the trading logs re: those alt purchases to an accountant. It’s not gonna be anything crazy he says. But it’s being worked on.
I want to stay right with the IRS. My accountant only started digging into it this month but he says it’s not terribly complicated and that any competent accountant will have no problem handling it, since it’s ostensibly the same shit they deal with for peoples brokerage accounts.

Do it yourself. You need not worry about making an error. Especially since you have the knowhow to do it yourself. So go for it. Even if you make a mistake (err on the side of paying less not more is general rule of thumb) they will simply have you file an amended return. But in truth, at those levels they will not be scrutinizing it closely. I’m not trying to throw shade. Those are impressive gains, good work. It’s just the US government has bigger fish to fry.
Also: remember, basically no one in crypto is even paying their owed taxes. By even filing them in the first place you are so far ahead of the curve. You won’t be punished for it.

Agreed. I’d imagine IB will put up absurd restrictions to keep their clients away from it in the short term. Because CME seems to be pushing ahead despite his very valid concerns. So that’ll insulate IB, sorta at least.
Re: if client own the BTC, I agree. But that’s gonna take a long time to be feasible. IB certainly not gonna be at the bleeding edge regarding that.
The reason is simple. He completely 180d his position re: Bitcoin in only a few weeks. If you listen to the conference call from a few weeks ago, he was resolutely against ever trading BTC via IB. Granted this was in part because he didn’t understand it. Seems he got up to speed.
Anyway. We agree on the broad strokes. This is rushed and dangerous as hell. I’m glad Peterffy spoke up. But it seems they are gonna ignore it.
The irony is that the financialization (via this derivative) of BTC may be what brings the whole system down. I’ve got my popcorn ready.

While the CME Futures are a terrible idea, not for bitcoin or crypto but for the real economy, the one good thing that comes from this is that it helps prevent a flipping from occurring.
Because no, the CME cannot arbitrarily change the underlying asset.
Example: in 2018, pork consumption suddenly outpaces beef consumption in the US. CME announces that lean hog futures will now trade in place of live cattle futures and vice versa. Mass confusion arises when brokers take delivery of lean hog futures that are mooing. **This would never happen.**
Things like this begin to cement BTCs advantage.

IMO. One way to look at it is as a timeline.
Jan. 3 2009 is the origin in the era of blockchains.
While length is not the only important factor, it is one important factor. The reason that US Bonds are considered riskless is because of the uninterrupted chain of time that has been strung together without default.
Barring a systemic failure of the BTC blockchain it is quite literally impossible for any blockchain to stretch back as far as BTC.
Alt chains can outpace the growth (grow longer in terms of how much info encoded, etc) they can also introduce new innovations, and improve in many other ways. But barring BTC chain failure, no chain can exist for longer in terms of seconds.
Just one reason. But pretty important imo.

You make some very valid criticisms. But it’s worth mentioning that kraken handled the BCH fork very well. Accounts with BTC were credited very expeditiously.
Only an abundance of malice could cause someone to bang on about their trading engine and other issues without mentioning how well they handled BCH, especially in comparison to their peers. Especially considering OP was asking about the upcoming fork.

So far as I understand it, the worst case scenario is that S2X takes with it the majority of the hashing power and keeps it for a sustained period of time. This would cause BTC block discovery to sputter. If this persisted for a while, faith in BTC may also dip. The price then may also falter, which while not a bad thing necessarily, could engender more panic as people recognize the difficulty of moving their coin on a chain whose difficulty is way too high for the amount of mining attention it is receiving. This could all tail spin into a vicious cycle.
I doubt that this will happen. But it could happen.

As you kinda hit on, it’s a confluence if many factors, not merely the price. Things like:
How far out (in block height) the retargeting is?
Fee activity?
Electric cost?
Incentives on other SHA-256 chains?
The weekends “attack” or whatever ya wanna call it, was actually alot closer call than many realize. This is mainly because the orchestrators took these factors and seemingly attempted to coordinate all of them in hopes of creating a worst case scenario.
May not answer your question. But in essence. Price is only one factor, not really enough on its own. But combined with the others I have listed above and the many I have not, what you describe can happen.

You’re not wrong.
The thing is, it’s taking Bitcoiners a very long time to learn that BTC is a store of value and not a peer-to-peer digital cash.
The reason for this is that many of the early adopters of bitcoin are ideologues. They can’t believe that bitcoin has become the digital gold that underlies the entire crypto economy.
Instead they hold onto notions written in a white paper and ignore the reality that surrounds them.

Indeed. And as we have seen before. The big dips (not the ones from this summer) have been fast and plunging.
I’m not rooting for a correction. I’m just a bit worried about all this new money flowing into BTC, thinking exponential returns are basically guaranteed. It’s folks like that, that turn a 20% correction into an 80% crash. A person anticipating outsized returns usually can’t stomach the *dip* and then it becomes a crashing cycle.
I don’t have a crystal ball. I’m by no means willing to stake out a claim of when this will happen. But based on what I’m seeing right now, a crash is looming. For all I know, this thing runs up to 100k before crashing back down to 15k. I’m just saying the mania is setting in. Who knows how far up it will take us.

My crystal ball is out of order at the moment.
My brain says that we are nowhere closer to becoming a payment provider than we were two years ago. And it’s not because the tech isn’t advancing. It’s because I don’t hear any of these noobs (that you’re so excited about) saying “gotta get me some bitcoin because I can’t wait to transact in a more clumsy manner than what I use today.”
Furthermore, I’ve heard no compelling answer to the all important question of “why would I want to keep track of and pay capital gains on my cup of coffee purchased over the blockchain or via a lightning channel?”
So far, the best answer provided is usually “don’t pay tax, coercion is wrong.” And for those of us with something to lose, it does not suffice.

Don’t worry about it. There are much simpler hurdles to using Bitcoin for your coffee purchases. Bitcoin isn’t a currency, the government gets to decide that. And even though a bunch of kids call it a cryptocurrency does not make it so. Bitcoin is property, which has specific consequences. The most important of which is that it is subject to capital gains taxation.
Sure, this may change. Although it’s very unlikely. But as of now, Bitcoin for merchant transactions is absurd on its face.

Having limit up/down just means that the futures contract itself can’t fluctuate beyond those limits during a single day of trading. This does not prevent the underlying asset, in this case, BTC, from fluctuating more than said amount.
When a futures contract becomes locked limit up or down, it just takes X days for the contracts to come into alignment with the underlying asset.
It won’t necessarily stop what OP is talking about. But other aspects of the CME Futures instrument will, like, for one thing, max position sizes, which are going to be trivially small from the perspective of a bank.

Silver is not more scarce than gold. The accepted *measure* of scarcity is **stock to flow**, a ratio that takes the stockpile (current available stock) and divides it by the flow (annual production). While Silver is the only other commodity with a S2F meaningfully above 1, it is nowhere near Gold.




Now take a guess at what Bitcoin's is today and will be in May 2020.

And so as an advisor to ultra high net worth individuals you will know that this is what your job is like for many things.
Real Estate, Commodities, Convoluted Partnerships, Esoteric investments of all stripes, face many, if not most of the same hurdles. What you described for the first 2/3's of this essay is just your job. It's not related to Bitcoin at all. And the last bit about banking issues is something the little guy faces with Coinbase and their own banks nearly every day. Difference being, the ultra high net worth individual gets that particular problem sorted much faster than the average bloke. And lastly, re: returns, it's rather unlikely a person with that wealth is seeking triple digit returns. It's far more likely they are convinced of its merits as a hedge against traditional currency exposure (which is one of their biggest problems). This notion of selling a 20 billion dollar man on BTC because 'moon' is quite silly.
His concerns over those complications are supposed to be eradicated by you and your team for those precious basis points (one hopes).
In the end. The main reason this essay is solely addressing a hypothetical is because the ultra high net worth individual is incredibly skeptical and has yet to be convinced that Bitcoin has long term promise. That's not to say they are right. Simply that they can afford to be wrong.
Edit: All of that said, I would be interested in helping you with your personal domain website, since that looks to be a work in progress and one where I might be able to add some value (and dare I say somewhere you appear to need help).

I mean I think I can see where they are going from this. Based on this link and the WSJ article I think I started seeing their perspective.
For instance the WSJ article today noted that an IBM chain could be used to reconcile hardware registrations. It struck me because today I spent too long on a phone call with a large software company trying to get some corporate software verified as properly registered and within license.
I've also had this trouble as a household consumer when I needed help and had to go through hoops with an old computer and its MS Office suite.
It strikes me that internal Blockchains are a decent way for large enterprises to store registration and licensing info on their customers. It's just to me, the intermediaries they might be talking about are their costs, things like technical support and customer service.

Your shit isn't scarce though. That's a misunderstanding of scarcity. The annual flow of your poo far outweighs the stockpile of your poo readily accessible (no, it being down in the sewer doesn't count). Your poo is literally the worst example you could think of. It's SF is essentially 0 as you don't have stockpiles of your poo.
When discussing Bitcoin (or gold) scarce isn't just a generic english word, it has a technical meaning and is quantified by stock to flow.

Bitcoin is better money. Bitcoin is not better currency. That’s all intended.
@_date: 2019-04-26 04:57:21
I personally see Bitcoin as solely digital gold. I've never understood the currency stance that most people seem to take. I think it's becoming clear that Bitcoin's value isn't derived from its usefulness in commerce, but from it's unforgeable costliness as Szabo puts it.
I'd imagine it will function much like gold has and does now. As the hardest form of money that is shifted around primarily by massive stakeholders. Much in the way gold is / was shifted around in bank vaults between nation states and the super elite.
I think things like Lightning are great, but at the end of the day, I think they will fail. The people coding these solutions are brilliant minds but they have a fatal flaw, they spend all day behind their keyboards. They imagine what commerce could look like using Bitcoin, but seem to have very little real world experience with how commerce works today.
It's the same reason why academics like Obama and Elizabeth Warren make bad leaders. Their understanding of being an executive is all academic. I'm sure this will inflame partisans feelings, I just reached for the most readily accessible example.
Bitcoin is the most brilliant invention of the internet age. What I like about attempts at innovation like Lightning is that they have the humility to be honest 2nd layers. I'm all for them working if in fact they do, but I severely doubt they will.
In the end, Bitcoin's price seems to be ludicrously correlated to its SF (Stock to Flow). And the best part about Bitcoin, from my perspective, is that I know exactly what that number will be from now to forever (for my lifespan at least).
tl;dr - Bitcoin is quantifiably scarce and it's the only digital asset that is truly scarce. That's why it has value, everything else is just window dressing.
ninja-edit: No casual person actually understands the true mechanics of why Gold is monetary metal beyond "it's rare." Just as no normal person will actually understand why Bitcoin is rare, imo.
2nd edit: I didn't answer your question, lol. I think what is likely to happen is that a few "shithole countries" will slowly stockpile Bitcoin, which will awaken an Bitcoin Standard from the bottom up. Unlike the Gold standard kinda being instantiated from the top down (global order wise). This used to seem far-fetched to me. But the thing is, there is already precedent for "shithole countries" using finite assets to become global powerhouses, when they literally have nothing at all going for them. Looking at you Saudi Arabia (yes, it's people included).

**Stock to flow**
The hardest moneys have the highest stock to flow ratios. Gold, historically the best money, has a stock to flow of 62. Silver is the only other thing on earth (besides Bitcoin) whose stock to flow is reasonably above 1. Bitcoin’s stock to flow doubles every four years as a result of the halvings. And Bitcoin’s stock to flow right now is about 25.
Stock to flow is what gives monetary instruments their value. Put another way: scarcity is what drives value for money.
Re: you’re inequality question - I don’t think it will be for the reasons you state. But no, bitcoin won’t solve wealth disparity. Historically, better money is not better because it shifts wealth down. In fact it’s history is that it shifts wealth upward. But we don’t live in historically high times of inequality at all, that’s ‘fake news’ as they say.

Your shit is not stockpiled (it is not readily at hand even in your septic tank, which your post history reveals you don't even have, lol). And no it is not considered money because, amongst many reasons, it does not have unforgeable costliness.

Wait what? Zero conf transactions have always been something a user could view as nearly instantaneous. A burgeoning fee market does not  render zero conf transactions any more or less valid.

His comments feel a great deal more measured than the silly comments made by Dimon. Even just scanning the posts here, it becomes hard to argue with his initial assertion.
Much of the activity surrounding BTC is speculative. And his comment about it not being useful as a currency rings true for me. Whenever I fire up my Trezor I cringe a bit when I see that my purchase of 10 Bitcoin decals from several years ago, purchased in BTC, display the current USD value of several hundred dollars.
I don’t see speculation as negative. Much, if not all, of our activities are based in speculation. I hold certain equities in my portfolio that I candidly assess to be speculative.
I do think the term ‘cryptocurrency’ is becoming less descriptive of the instruments I hold. I recognize that it’s utility as a currency has played an important role in making Bitcoin what it is. But I am starting to feel that BTCs hyper-appreciation is in conflict with it becoming a ubiquitous currency that any but the completely marginalized resort to using.

Well yes. Currency (Money for our purposes here) have three main properties, as defined historically:
- storage of value
- medium for exchange
- unit of account
This picture is not yet fully painted. And so we will have to wait and see what kind of money BTC really ends up being. But most are kidding themselves when they claim BTC is useful as either a medium of exchange or a unit of account.
It’s tremendous appreciation in value has made it a ludicrously good store of value along one axis, and its trustworthiness (the other axis) has come a long way as it comes up on a decade in maintaining itself as a reliable store of value. However, it’s deflationary behavior that has so far wrought excessive levels of appreciation in USD denominations comes at the cost of the other two characteristics of money.
A week ago there was a thread in here for people trying to convince themselves that spending BTC in the past was not something they regret. The only examples that seemed even remotely convincing were posted by anarcho-capitalist type ideologues.
Just a cursory glance at this subreddit shows that most are interested in holding the coin, not spending it. This doesn’t mean it’s not a currency, just that the flavor profile of this currency is decidedly ‘Store of value’ at this point.

I don’t have much to add re: the particulars of your situation. Although I am following it closely as it pertains to me as well. I’ll be curious to see how it ends up for us both. I will simply add the following:
If you listen to this weeks conference call, you will hear the CEO opine on BTC itself. His comment ostensibly rules out ever supporting Bitcoin (the actual instrument itself) and places he and his company on the wrong side of crypto. Whether he realizes that his comment does so is another story entirely.
I bring this up just so that you know that IB is taking a strident anti-crypto position that frankly one would not expect. It is sad because many of their customers would probably agree that IB is usually quite ‘tech-forward.’
You may want to consider switching away from IB if crypto related securities are beginning to make up a large portion of your portfolio. Because the company is clearly not headed in the right direction on crypto unfortunately.

Bitcoin is no longer a p2p currency. Frankly it barely ever was. I did a few transactions in the past and it was always clunky and nerve wracking. Granted in those days the fees and delays were minimal / non-existent.
Bitcoin, if it continues to succeed will likely seed the ground for an actual p2p money / layer that could be used by a great many people. But Bitcoin itself, in its current state, is a store of value.

No.... they aren't. The article explains as much. You are running out of replies. But I will try.
SF is driving price.
Platinum is rare (incredibly rare actually). It's SF does not drive it's value. Because it's not scarce (as defined by SF). Platinum's utility drives it's value, like almost everything else on earth. Now, platinum has unforgeable costliness. It must be mined, it cannot be created out of whole cloth.
So unforgeable costliness is not what drives price directly. It is merely a pre-condition necessary for an asset to take on monetary properties.
Gold and Silver have achieved this because for thousands of years, people have hoarded it as money. Their stock is high, while the flow remains well under that stock.
No other thing on earth has acheived this, except Bitcoin.
No one is saying that if I print out 100 pieces of paper with the word token on them and then setup a system whereby 1 additional paper token is printed every year, that it having a stock to flow of 100 would make it valuable. The reason is that unforgeable costliness is a pre-condition.
Adoption (particularly mining) has made Bitcoin more and more costly to forge.
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:31:13
Unforgeable costliness. Bitcoin is the only digital asset that has meaningfully achieved this.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:59:27


Perhaps. I think that sophisticated boomers understand gold as money and that's who this is for. That sounds like a good idea for another 1-pager. I see this as a series.

Become a master of your subject. Definitely read Saifedeans book, **The Bitcoin Standard**.
For my part. The key is to never harp on the buzzwords this community loves so much: decentralization, immutability, proof-of-work, blockchain. Fancy language always wreaks of scam. Speak in grounded terms and explain calmly why gold has value (they don't know about stock-to-slow trust me, lol) and then explain why digital gold exists, how we know it's secure, and that a hard money for the age of computers is something worth buying a little bit of.

You shouldn’t get paid in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a currency despite what many think. Bitcoin is merely the next evolution of money. It is the best form of money because of its immutable properties. And so... it is now working thru the markets to unseat gold (the long reigning most supreme form of money). This will take time and will see many ups and downs.
But no, bitcoin is definitely not a currency, nor is it a viable alternative to the greatest currency in human history, the USD. So you should get paid in USD and convert what you wish to save into BTC.

Bitcoin is the first and only digital asset to be both quantifiably scarce and provably secure.
All other digital assets only make gestures at these fundamental properties. Including the asset you mention.
Having a blockchain isn’t enough. There is a critical difference between assets which are rare and things that are scarce. Platinum is rare but it is not scarce (as quantified by stock-to-flow). The asset you mention is rare in that it has a blockchain which limits its supply, but it is not truly scarce because it and all of the other coins / tokens like it have not meaningfully achieved unforgeable costliness as defined by Nick Szabo.
Bitcoin is utterly difficult to forge and it is on its way to becoming impossible to forge. It’s tide will indeed lift most of the boats. But Bitcoin is the only one with claim to being the sea.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:20:30
Do we really think that ‘newcomers’ are sophisticated enough to internalize any of these things.

@_date: 2019-05-15 04:48:41
Bitcoin is exponentially ahead of all other crypto when it comes to **unforgeable costliness**. It has achieved escape velocity on this central pre-condition for digital scarcity. Other coins have the scarcity (PoW or whatever else they concoct to achieve this) but they are not meaningfully costly to forge. Ethereum is entire orders of magnitude weaker when it comes to this pre-condition. A pre-condition written about rather eloquently and famously by Nick Szabo. I suggest researching this.

Bitcoin is the only digital asset that has achieved unforgeable costliness in any meaningful sense. Hashrate, node count, on-ramps, lifespan, all contribute to why this is true.

No one is going to bring down gold and or silver (the only monetary metals). They will bring down rare earths that have extreme value in production. Like palladium today perhaps.
You really might want to discern the difference between monetary metals and rare earths / other mined commodities.
Only gold and silver have taken on this monetary aspect that you need to learn about. This is because of thousands of years of stockpiling and coinciding low utility.

1. The stock and flow are known (perfectly I might add). The demand is not known, this doesn't imply that it is known. We merely believe that with the flow radically shrinking every four years, similar demand means pricier BTC. All models make assumptions. What's interesting about this model, to anyone who knows anything about them, is that it makes very few assumptions. 10 thousand years of gold tells us that scarce things find demand.
2. Here's the most common misunderstanding. No other digital asset is meaningfully scarce. Even Ethereum (a selected alt that **may** not be complete shit) hashrate is an utter joke compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the only digital thing on earth that has meaningfully achieved *unforgeable costliness* (Szabo). This doesn't preclude the possibility of a "next bitcoin." But it paints a clear picture.
There is only one quantifiably scarce digital asset that is provably secure and likely to remain so, that asset is Bitcoin.

It's saying that the model predicts fair value for such and such timeframe. It's not at all saying, "the market will price Bitcoin at 55k." It's an important distinction.
I disagree with your prediction. Normies don't matter. Hedge Funds, family offices, and Ultra-High-Net-Worth individuals have awoken to this market in earnest, they will drive the price skyward. The "paychecked" will have very little to do with price action, they rarely do. Lastly, Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's money. It's utility is as money, not as a transaction currency.
People buying burgers with Bitcoin is not and should not happen imo.

Mmhmm. It is important for you to distinguish between commodities and monetary metals / commodity moneys. Your OP does not properly describe this.

You are missing the forest for the trees. Bitcoin isn’t a currency that will compete with other technologies (cash, credit, etc.)  for transactions. Buying a burger with Bitcoin isn’t the point.
Bitcoin is money. Specifically, Bitcoin is Ideal Money as defined by John Nash (A Beautiful Mind). It is mathematical gold and is on a march to get out ahead of gold to become the hardest asset the world has ever seen.
It’s not about small transactions. It’s all about the digital scarcity making it the hardest money available to anyone who wants to save money.

No other coin is meaningfully secure when stood next to Bitcoin. If a coin is not meaningfully secure then it has not truly achieved unforgeable costliness as defined by Szabo. And it follows that things that do not meet the pre-condition of unforgeable costliness are not truly scarce.
Example - viacoin is a 2018 Honda Civic. No one is in the business of doing so, but someone could rather easily manufacture one (forge) if they were motivated to. They aren’t tho, because 2018 Honda Civics aren’t valuable. Bitcoin is an incredibly rare Ferrari. A motivated actor could attempt to manufacture one, but the difficulty would be enormous and it gets more and more out of reach the longer time progresses.

Different focuses for different folks. You are free to create your own. I would love to see some sheets focusing on what you feel is important. Thank you for your feedback.


Then it did it's job

Thank you, that means alot to me. It's an always-evolving work in progress, I'm glad you like it.

Utility in commercial applications has rather little to do with its value just FYI. Best estimates are that 15% of its value comes from its utility as anything other than a monetary asset.

No one will be mining fucking gold in asteroids anytime soon. Gold is a monetary asset with shockingly little utility value. If you think men are going to send probes up to asteroids hunting for gold, you are going to be very disappointed.
They will be mining the rare earths that have extreme utility for production; not fucking monetary metals that have almost no utility. This is absurd conjecture based on a complete misunderstanding of basically everything and anything.

1. Only time will tell, the nature of forecasts is that they stake a claim. I'm unclear as to yours, perhaps because there really isn't one, beyond "some scarce things have seen their demand dry up."
2. You agree, that's good.
A financial model like this does not say, "Bitcoin will be this price on this date." But I guess that's not surprising to see a general audience fail to understand this.

I completely agree, this was piss poor.
O'Leary gave him the perfect opening when he said, "I get gold..."
Pompliano should have mustered. "If you get gold, then you understand that most of gold's value is a product of its stock-to-flow, which is what makes gold and silver monetary assets. Stock-to-flow is the ratio of current available stockpiles to annual production. Silver has a stock-to-flow of 22, Gold has a stock-to-flow of 62. Care to guess what Bitcoin's stock-to-flow is today Mr. Wonderful? How about Platinum?"
(Bitcoin's Stock-to-flow is 25. But platinum's is only 1.1. It helps deomnstrate to people that commodities are not all the same, only two in the history of mankind have achieved monetary status. Being rare, which platinum is, isn't enough. And guess what, only one digital object has ever truly done the same and it was created ten years ago. Oh and one last thing. Bitcoin's stock-to-flow increases to 50 in about twelve months.)
But it seems Pompliano himself is unaware of how monetary assets become monetary assets, which in and of itself says way too much about crypto funds, CNBC itself, and Pompliano.

This is my work. Thanks for the help. I appreciate it.
If you are interested, could you help me reformulate those last two sentences. 
I am working on updates.

Really well done. Maybe we do it across 3 paragraphs. Change the order away from "51%," store of value, rail, don't mention government. Explain scarcity, touch reverse transactions immunity. People want to be gently dipped into the pool as with any baptism. Not thrust into: '51% attacks to reverse transactions.'
I would love to collaborate

I don’t see retail driving this upward. I think those without paychecks and those who are already highly liquid are the drivers of BTC$ here.
Bitcoin will be yet another example of why the rich get richer. And there’s nothing wrong with that imo.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:50:59
Understood. Gold is money in the classical sense. It may not circulate as money today. But that doesn’t mean it’s not money.
Szabo is the definitive writer on this topic if you are interested in learning more.

Yes. And having Brad Katsuyama in the mix on our side is hugely beneficial. This is seriously fantastic news.

Use the web interface or an app wrapper instead of the command line. YouTube videos can help you.

The most convincing valuation model utilizes stock-to-flow imo. Bitcoin is simply digital gold. And as digital gold it is fast approaching hardness (monetary asset like gold is the hardest money as if today) beyond Gold’s SF of 62. BTC has SF of about 25 now. Doubling to 50 in about twelve months.
This may not sway you at the moment. I kinda doubt anything can right now. But perhaps if BTC price correlation with SF continues going forward, you might be able to recognize this down the road when you look back in a comment like this.
SF valuation says BTC fair value will be around $50k in twelve months. The market will in all likelihood overshoot that price significantly as it has the last two times when SF doubled due to the known halvings.
