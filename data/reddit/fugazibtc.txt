I'm also a cryptocurrency fanatic.    
I want to promote what i know is a better way of finance. I also want to promote what is a better way of transportation. And i fucking want to buy a Tesla model x with my mother fucking bitcoin!!

Thanks for the friendly advice.    
As a neckbeard, with zero-to-little real world financial knowledge, I'm doing the best i know how. I am trying to put some of my wealth into an asset i think is beneficial for humanity. I decided that doing so publicly might be uber beneficial, for both bitcoin and tesla.    
Now I'm tired. I'm going to throwaway this account. If Tesla responds I will too. If anyone of you helps, I'll give a finder's fee. goodnight

me too

No. That's not what i mean. I mean: Tesla should accept BTC. period. That's what i mean.    
now, zzz

If you understand and appreciate bitcoin/blockchain, then you should understand anonymity.    
If you understand anonymity, you should expect 0 day accounts in this subreddit.    
I'm not shilling, scamming, spamming. I'm not looking for investors, I'm not posting links.    
I want to buy a car with bitcoin. A cool car.    
Don't be a hater.

You, ReddHerring, are accusing me of being a Red Herring. It's irony. Also, I have a lot of bitcoin, and i want to buy a tesla. believe it or not
@_date: 2014-01-12 06:45:58
for the good of bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:39:07
You are an expert in human greed?    
I'm not. I am pretty altruistic. I believe that bitcoin will help those who aren't greedy to succeed, for themselves and for their future, non-greedy, progeny.    
I also am an environmentalist.    
I don't believe in God.    
I have a shitton of bitcoins.    
I want to remain anonymous.    
And, fuck greedy people.

some of us are early adopters. I don't want a lambo like Goat

This, right here, is an attempt by a bitcoin 'whale', to get shit done. I am trying to buy a car a want, publicly, in order to promote BTC and electric cars.    
Greed is fucking weird man. I got lucky, and maybe I understood the significance of what i invested in.    
Of course it's luck. But I want everyone to benefit.    
Bitcoin is significant. If you've spent any time learning, instead of looking at charts, you would understand the MONUMENTAL significance of bitcoin.

Sounds like you are a stand up human. All the best
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:57:12
There is a difference between being an expert and being an observer
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:13:34
Oh, you'd say there's a fair possibility? Wow. You sound like an expert. What do you think they'll recommend? Paying with Paypal?
    
And, "cashing out" completely defeats the purpose of bitcoin.    
so, edumacate yoself and stfu    
the finder fee offer stands, if you can get tesla to respond to my post here
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:03:27
I did email. And I'm pretty sure about the response I'll receive...    
I'm trying to "back channel" them :)    
I think reddit is the best platform
