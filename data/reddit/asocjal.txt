There is some group of people who already saw my whitepaper and instead of  talking about technical details, they trying to convince me, that small nodes are not needed, because bitcoin has SPV, thin clients etc. An we started to talk about bitcoin instead of new crypto. So I'm trying to split those two topics. First - do we really need such crypto. Second - how to develop it. But maybe you are right and maybe I should just put link to the whitepaper. It is 4 pages long.

Hi, do you have some link to this project?

I know and sure - those are trade offs, but:
1. You can setup your own server.
2. You can connect to some of your friends server
3. Maybe some bots could from time to time compare routes found by server to check out if server doesn't have modified routing algorithm.

In order to find route, Olympus is trying to send payment with fake payment hash? I like idea of Olympus. It makes a lot of sense. It solves few issueas that Eclair have.
