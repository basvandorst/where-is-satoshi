I believe your fears are overwrought. Storing wealth in bitcoin is the same as putting cash under the mattress. It's okay for an emergency stash but bad for full scale wealth investing since it doesn't generate returns and more importantly subtracts liquidity from the economy.

You would only store the 32 byte hash of the document and its location on a file storage service like Storj on the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain. This could be accomplished by sending yourself a few satoshis or Ethers with the appropriate transaction fee of course.

Not true. Holding bitcoin is like holding the deed to undeveloped real-estate, where the real estate is future transaction recording space on the blockchain.

This economist doesn't understand the subtleties of mining. The $5000.btc figure is meaningless in the long term. When the price of bitcoin falls below the costs of mining them, miners drop out, the network becomes smaller as the difficulty decreases. Bitcoin worked just fine when one bitcoin was $100 and it will work fine at $1000.
The question is whether the demand for bitcoin will decrease enough to cause a shrinkage of the whole network when prices go below $5000. Completely ignoring speculation demand, this depends on the growth of value transfer demand as well as demand for blockchain trust applications like contracts and the dependence of business on them. It may be that business users will be required to post periodic transaction fees to keep the network robust and secure to make sure contracts stay "alive" on the blockchain. Another source of demand nobody's thought of.
Currently the demand for bitcoin for these practical uses are minuscule and all the demand is based upon the anticipated future demand for real use cases.

If the price of bitcoin rises so also rises the number of users of bitcoin. As more people become dependent on the iron-clad security of the blockchain for the protection of their funds then the cost of mounting a 51% attack on the chain must also rise as any failure would affect more people and therefor be a better target politically or criminally. The bitcoin "organism" handles this situation automatically by increasing the number of miners that have to be nullified in a 51% attack when the price rises by incentivizing them to buy mining equipment and participate in the profits. Normally a decision like this would have to made by human managers and directors. It just shows how organic bitcoin is as cultural innovation.

Consider that each time one the 10 million new bitcoin buyers per month buys a part of a bitcoin and stores it under his virtual mattress, it is gone from the supply and the remaining new bitcoin buyers must fight over the remaining ones.

No. The exchange does not buy the bitcoin. It provides a platform on line that brings the buyer and seller together where the seller can post the price he is willing to sell at and the buyer can post the price at which he is willing buy. This exchange of bitcoin never actually makes it to the blockchain but instead is recorded in the exchanges "internal blockchain". It is only when removing purchased coins from the exchange that the transfer appears on the blockchain.

The people speculating are small bettors who are basically losers who played the lottery to get rich before they found bitcoin. Their volume is so small, probably averaging $100 per account, that they won't have any effect if they sell.
The other newcomers are small educated investors with accounts of about $1000-5000  who don't want to miss out if the whole world runs on a bitcoin blockchain in a few years. They have long timelines on the performance of bitcoin so they put their bitcoins under a virtual mattress and forget about, checking the price once a week..
Then you have the whale investors who are in bitcoin to make money. These are people with Wall Street skills who have no emotional ties to bitcoin but plenty to the value of their cash investment.

All bitcoin, sold and unsold, exists on the blockchain. The private keys that control the ownership of all bitcoin sold and unsold exist not on the blockchain but  in wallets spread around the world in iPhones, personal computers, crypto-currency  exchanges (Coinbase), hardware wallet devices (Trezor, KeepKey)  and even paper (as paper wallets). 
The sum total of all bitcoin sold and unsold is about 16M. Of this maybe 10M bitcoin have never been sold on an exchange and may never be sold. That leaves about 5M bitcoins available for the world to fight over. This fight is acted out as bidding wars in currency exchanges for the bitcoins that come on the market. It is this process  that frequently drives the price to the high levels we are now seeing.

Coinbase is a great way to protect your bitcoin assets. Hardware wallets and wallets that run on devices like PCs and phones are more vulnerable to mistakes that could end up with lost funds such as getting hacked by malware, forgotten passwords, lost or stolen backup paper wallets. None of these are issues with coinbase because they control the keys and they worry about backing up at a corporate level.
The days of fly-by-night exchanges (MtGox) are over. With their accounting and security practices modern exchanges are as risk free as banks. 
The only risk I see with coinbase is the political risk from government regulation such as if the government tells them to freeze their customer assets. Then having bitcoin in an offline wallet is better.

A debt based economy is absolutely necessary to its function. The multiplication of deposits into credit expansion increases liquidity that is needed for new investment and consumption. Bitcoin will be unsuitable as a currency in a fractional reserve banking system such as this because it cannot be created out of thin air like dollars. 
The best hope for bitcoin will be for banks to issue their own crypto-currency tokens which are based on the value of their bitcoin deposits. This, by the way, is exactly what happened in 1840s when the currency was gold based and there wasn't enough of it to supply the liquidity necessary to run the economy. So the banks began issuing their own "banknotes". The federal government took over the banknote printing which is what we have today.
Strangely, the end result of bitcoin may be as a digital "gold" on which a government issued crypto-currency is based.

Fractional Reserve is necessary to increase liquidity in the economy. If the banks did not "create" new money based on the deposits they had there would be no money for mortgages or car loans or the interest rates would be so high that only the rich could afford to borrow.

The only way Tether could influence the price of Bitcoin is if the Bitfinex exchange is using unsold tethers they have printed to open trading accounts on other exchanges and using those accounts to buy bitcoin. 
If the bitcoin seller cannot sell his Tether balance  back to the Bitfinex for dollars then the scheme would fall apart. Bitfinex seems to be have enough cash on hand to satisfy Tether claims probably because traders prefer to keep their "cash" balances in Tether. 
So without the audit transparency it must be assumed that part of the demand for Bitcoin in the world market comes from hundreds of millions of dollars that are only partially backed by dollars. Wether this small fraction of trading volume (1%) is sufficient to maintain bitcoin's current price is doubtful. But it is psychologically defeating that even a small fraction of Bitcoin's demand is not real.

The proposals you read about are not real blockchains in the sense that they are secured by permissioned "miners" who are employed by the banks and their partners. They think the Automated Clearing House (ACH) settlement process will go faster if a group of "captive" trustworthy computers create a consensus  on the veracity of the transactions posted to their "blockchain" much as the bitcoin blockchain does. This model, though, will never compete with bitcoin because the reward for "mining" i.e.  authorizing transactions will be dollars, euros, etc. or some digital token that can be exchanged for them. In order to post transactions to their blockchain you will have to go through a lot of red tape to open an account. Therefor you can rest assured that private blockchains will never be useful for the thousands of yet un-thought-of  applications that require the cheap source of trust that the bitcoin blockchain provides.

Devaluing Bitcoin by subdividing it will not be possible because of the value it needs to run the network and authenticate the blockchain.  The whole world can enter colored coin transactions for the minimum of 10,000 satoshis but Miners will not touch those transactions without a reasonable fee attached. Therefor Miner expenses become a floor beneath which the value of Bitcoin cannot sink. 
So it's easy to see that as the blockchain permeates economic life and the block reward becomes smaller and disappears demand for Bitcoin will come from blockchain users who need to get their transactions mined and will pay what the going price is for authenticating their tiny fraction of the block. 
There may come a time when the growth of the transaction rate will cause the finite supply of Bitcoins to be subdivided again and again to meet the demands of maybe billions of transactions per hour but those small number of Satoshis offered as transactions fees will never be lower in dollars than the cost to process the block.

Power arbitrage allows mining to stand-in for old power plant customers after the plant is no longer useful or for new power plant customers that don't yet exist as communities are slowly built out. 
The result is longer life for aging power sources or less risk for new ones since bitcoin mining picks up the tab for operating power plants that do not yet have their full customer bases in place.
This advantage to the power industry was never considered when bitcoin was invented. This is called serendipity.

MtGox made a lot of people a lot of money. If you had ignored your "warning signs" on the world's most popular exchange in 2011 and bought into Bitcoin on Gox you would be a rich man now. Creditors who had coin on Gox they bought for $10 and failed to move to cold storage will still make nearly a ten fold profit after liquidation. So your vague statement of warning signs and your resorting to personal terms like dishonesty  shows you have a failed argument. You are either incapable of articulating your position or you're just parroting information that you had seen on Reddit without really understanding it in depth.   Maybe you're just congratulating yourself on avoiding MtGox because you missed the opportunity to get into Bitcoin early and cannot admit that there are MtGox traders who made small fortunes while your "warning signs" were flashing danger.

Right now the the demand for bitcoin to pay  for practical applications like smart contracts, value transfers and payments are not sufficient to consume miners expenses who immediatly sell their block rewards to pay for power. To sustain a steady price or increase the price that shortfall must be made up by new investors and old investors adding to their positions. The motivation for bitcoin buyers without a practical need is that the practical demand will soon overwhelm the amount of bitcoins available leading to a great appreciation in price. A large practical demand for bitcoin is a few years off so now any rise in price reflects the success the pro-bitcoin media is having selling the narrative to ordinary investors.

The smart money knows how this is going to play out.  Karpeles probably made a huge blunder last year when he sold Bitcoins belonging to customer accounts at $10 per Bitcoin to pay for operating expenses planning to pay them back when the price went back down. When Bitcoin rallied to $800 he was caught in a classic short squeeze from which there was no recovery. So he  invented a story that the Bitcoins had been stolen by hackers exploiting the malleability bug which has been repeatedly debunked by careful analysis of the block chain. He will eventually be convicted of fraud and spend a large part of his young years in prison away from his family.

The US legal system has many more protections than any country in the EU and is the envy of the world, mainly because of its obsessive and almost freakish protection of personal freedoms like speech, a right that the EU members are loath to grant their citizens. Remember that France, Germany, Italy and others put historians in jail for publishing "incorrect" views of World Word II history justifying such laws on the grounds that these incorrect views offend certain minority groups. 
US courts are seen by the world legal community as fair and incorruptible which is why lawyers the world over bend over backwards to get US court jurisdiction over their cases.

They all but admitted that they had experienced some losses due to the "txid malleability" issue but the idea that this has left all their account holders with nothing is absurd. If they have suffered a substantial deficit of 10 or 20 percent then this could be made up substantially  with trading fees which are about $10M since withdrawals were suspended or even Karpleses' private stash of 200,000 BTC which he would be under pressure to contribute for his feckless management of the exchange. The worst case I see is that Gox accounts would take a 10 or 15 percent haircut. Strangely, the Goxcoin market is showing an 75-80% haircut since Goxcoin is selling at an 80% discount from the world market price of Bitcoin.

Yanis is correct that bitcoin cannot be "printed" in a fractional reserve banking system when more liquidity is required for the economy. However there are solutions to that problem that would allow banks to issue tokens (tethers) as loans when more liquidity is needed. 
Also he neglects the bitcoin blockchain as a trust platform/public key infrastructure  on which millions of smart contracts will be based. These will require bitcoin to be used not as a currency but as a fee for use of the blockchain.﻿

Current methods of implementing time release messages uses non-parallelizible proof-of-work schemes such as  time lock puzzles which forces the virtual safe to expend an amount of computer processing time equivalent to the time of release to solve a puzzle. 
S = ((a)^2)^t(modn)
Ks = K + S
Where S is a secret number which when added to the encryption key, K, to be released in the future results in an encrypted encryption key Ks. The value t is a number which represents the time interval between the present and the time and date that the message is to be released. For example, the following program releases a key, K after 50 years  
	int(256) Ks = 348693091498457323860549873948567; /* hidden key K+S */
	int t = 26456484995857577; /* desired elapsed time of 50 years                    */
	int (256) K = 0;	           /* key to be released       	                          */
	for (i = 1; i == t; i++)
 		S = (a**(2**i));
	K = Ks – S;
This imposes high costs in dedicated  processing for long time-to-release values (one to fifty years) but cannot be defeated by attackers with parallel computing resources.

Mt Gox could be supporting the price of Bitcoin on their own exchange by buying cheap from their customers. This would be a good way to raise cash since there's nothing to prevent them from making arbitrage plays on the other exchanges. To raise Bitcoin they could keep the coins they buy as well as the brokerage trading fees which are I think around 20,000 BTC since they closed off withdrawals. This should be enough to make a big dent in any "malleability losses".

The real (intrinsic) value of Bitcoin is not in its store of value but in the blockchain network and access to a cheap decentralized source of trust, that can quickly, cheaply and securely send any amount of value across the world in an instant. If you want to play on the blockchain you need to buy a ticket and that ticket is Bitcoin. Just as a UPS label has no intrinsic value without the UPS shipping network so Bitcoin has no value without its network. Imagine a world where there could only be 15 million UPS labels. Do you think they would have more value than the paper they are printed on? This extensibility of the blockchain is what a lot of laymen/analysts are missing but has not escaped the notice of some very smart people on Wall Street.

Of course  America created the market for slavery and exploited the  African tribal society that had been practicing it on their own for centuries. If you ignore the bad choices the African slave merchants made you are (probably willfully) missing the whole story.
Your Huffpost reference reinforces my point if you read it carefully. It says 25% of the welfare is consumed by blacks but since blacks make up only 12% of the population it means that they are 3 or 4 times more likely to be on public assistance. The actual figure from the Census Bureau is 41.6% for blacks and 13.2% for whites.
Government assistance is not the only source of subsidies. It occurs through affimative action and contract set-asides for minority contractors non of which would ever be possible without the guilt of slavery in the background driving everything. This is why slavery guilt has become an industry used by the Al Sharptons and Jesse Jacksons  but not the Kayne Wests who see it for what it is and finally called it out.

The liquidity demand for BTC payments is a minuscule fraction of the total liquidity available. Although the number of new wallets are increasing at about 16% per month (Blockchain.info) they contain only fractions of BTC but enough for noobies to conduct experimental and novelty transactions which, if you look at the network feed is only 2 or 3 per second from all over the whole world. Then compare this with the total liquidty of Bitcoin, $6B which is supposedly about half the total number of $1 bills in circulation. Bitcoin demand by speculators with their private unpredictable motivations for trading dwarfs demand for Bitcoin's intended purpose-- value transfer. So I think we'll have to wait for these new infrastructure projects to begin producing risk mitigation and user friendly products before Bitcoin jumps to the next level where liquidity demand for payments seriously starts affecting the price.

The case the Gox suitors make to the 127,000 Gox creditors is that Japanese liquidations typically take ten years to complete and return the creditors only 3% of the liquidated assets.   They are correct in assuming that it is unlikely that any Japanese court or trustee will have any incentive to look after the interests of a bunch of foreign creditors and will sell the 200,000 Bitcoins at the lowest possible value to close the case so they can get on with their lives. This is a given in the business/legal environment of a third world people. The alternative proposed by the Gox suitors is to allow the suitors to take over the Gox company and the 200,000 Bitcoins and rebuild the MtGox site, hunt down the lost 650,000 coins and  keep the 200,000 BTC in trust for the creditors and essentially ride the growth of Bitcoin to profitability over the coming years. The problem with this business model is how long can the new management last without being infected with the Karpeles disease and begin raiding the 200,000 Bitcoin stash for operating expenses. I as a 75 Bitcoin MtGox creditor would be much more comfortable if they bought in to Gox with a year or two of operating capital.

The characteristics that everybody else buys bitcoin for are absent at Mt Gox-- you can't spend them or trade them on the world market-- they even have their own name now "Goxcoin". Therefor all fundamentals on Goxcoin are about the likelihood of ever being able to spend and trade them on the world market. This likelihood is measured in the Gox market by the discount traders pay for them measured against the world price which is about 80%. Even you would pay $10 for 100 BTC on Gox if some rumour caused it to crash to ten cents because you know that if you could transfer even one coin out you would make $500.

It’s pretty much common knowledge that Karpeles made a huge blunder last year when he sold Bitcoins belonging to customer accounts at $10 per Bitcoin to pay for operating expenses planning to pay them back when the price went back down. When Bitcoin rallied to $800 he was caught in a classic short squeeze from which there was no recovery. So he invented a story that the Bitcoins had been stolen by exploiting of the malleability bug which has been debunked by careful analysis of the block chain. He will eventually be convicted of fraud and spend a large part of his young years in prison away from his family.

The market for Goxcoin seems to be saying that MtGox has at least 20% of their Bitcoin obligations on hand since Goxcoin is selling at an 80% discount from the world market. That means the guy yesterday who bought $320,000 worth of Goxcoin at $110 believes that even if Gox allows him to withdraw only 20% of his coins he will still break even. If he is allowed withdraw half his coins he will make a profit of $400,000.

The rogue transactions would probably show up in the chain as two txs occurring within a few days of each other with identical outputs, possibly identical inputs with known MtGox addresses and different but functionally equivalent ScriptSig script code, (this being one of the ways to alter the tx ID hash). In other words look for identical txs that have different script code in the ScriptSig one of which deviates from the standard script code generated by the MtGox on line wallet.

I think the way to introduce Bitcoin mainstream is to do a reality documentary which follows a computer professional but not necessarily a crypto expert as he delights in the discovery of this new currency. We observe him take each step of discovery-- acquiring a wallet, making purchases on line, being amazed at how "invoice paid" flashes instantaneously after clicking the "pay" button, trying to explain it to his parents and girlfriend and finally taking the leap to becoming a miner. The same steps could also be explored from the POV of a non-tech savvy merchant as he tries to acquire the services of a Bitcoin payment gateway and then begins accepting payments.

Whitelisting/Blacklisting or embargoing certain addresses is inevitable since it would solve the problem of theft losses due to inept users as well as Bitcoin's use for illegal activity thus diminishing Bitcoin's reputation as an unregulated, dangerous free-for-all. The pros and cons of whitelisting/embargoing are directly related to whose ox is being gored. If some hacker had figured out a way to steal 90% of the Bitcoins in existence everyone would rise up and call for a quarantine of the theif's address. The people against whitelisting have nothing to lose with its adoption except some vague notion of  libertarian anonymity and theoretical purity which is not practical in the real world.

Two gay guys are having a romantic candle lit dinner at home when one of them starts showing noticeable lower discomfort.
"What's the matter?" asks his boyfriend.
"There's something up inside me that's giving me trouble. Could you check it for me?"
   "Okay", says the boyfriend reluctantly.
   The boyfriend's partner bends over and the boyfriend inserts his finger into his ass and feels around for some offending object that might have been left from the night before.
  "Sorry", says the boyfriend. "There's nothing there."
  So they continue eating but the guy keeps shifting around in obvious discomfort, ruining the dinner experience until his boyfriend can no longer take it.
  "What's the matter?" demands the boyfriend.
  "I'm sorry could you check again. There's just something up there. I know it."
  "Okay," says the boyfriend reluctantly and proceeds to stick his whole hand into his partner's ass up to the wrist and explores the cavity then withdraws his hand in disappointment.
"Sorry," he says with resignation. "I can't find anything."
  So the boyfriend's partner continues to sulk still in discomfort obviously ruining the romantic candle lit meal until neither can take it any longer.
  "Will you try one more time?" demands the partner almost in tears. "It's up there a little  farther."
  "OKAY!" says the boyfriend.
  So the partner bends over and the boyfriend inserts his arm into his ass all the way up to the elbow with a loud squishy shhquuert sound then explores the area.  
 "Wait a minute," exclaims the boyfriend. "I found something!"
 When he pulls out his arm lo and behold there is a brand new Rolex on his wrist.

Many of us were already in when the warning signs became apparent, some even remained seeing an opportunity to buy cheap (&lt; $100) coin  and who could actually still see a profit when everything is settled. No one could predict that one of the principle Bitcoin exchanges in the world could lose nearly all its assets.

Private keys can be lost, accidentally deleted, or in the case of MtGox, never existed. MtGox customers did not have real Bitcoins but rather a  Bitcoin balance in a private ledger which represented the number of Bitcoins MtGox owed the customer out of its real wallet. MtGox probably emptied its wallet when it sold customer's Bitcoins to generate cash and fulfill customer Bitcoin withdrawals. The sad thing is that during the six months before shutdown MtGox customers were buying and selling each other's worthless balances in an internal ledger that were backed by no private keys.

I wouldn't worry about losing coins in a Gox wallet. Since wallets are cryptographically linked to the account holder with a unique Bitcoin address any attempt by Gox to "borrow" coins from a private account would have to show up in the blockchain and would be incriminating. Gox could maintain two sets of books by withholding the release of "borrowed" coin Txs to the blockchain thus maintaining their own blockchain and presenting a facade to the wallet owner but this would be a Bernie Madoff solution because none of their "borrowed" coins would be usable outside the Mt. Gox bubble.

We should look at what heppens when any brokerage maintaining real asset accounts on behalf of customers is liquidated such as would be the case of a failed stock or commodities broker. Valueing what each account has lost and therefor what should be payed back in liquidation becomes a problem when only some of the accounts have been pilfered and most are still intact. This is analogous to MtGox where in the abstract there can be said to be two kinds of accounts-- Bitcoin and cash. It seems like a judge would have to find a way to spread the loss of a single account over all unpilfered accounts which could only be accomplished if a percentage of the real assets in the unpilfered accounts are sold leading one to speculate that bitcoin balances in MtGox could not gain access to all the 202,000 BTC.

In valuing the remaining MtGox assets. You must include a list of 127,000 customers who are verified for international bank transfers and are considered "trade ready". This multiple million $ asset disappears if Gox is liquidated but can be used to partially offset the $10M expense Sunlot wants to hit the remaining assets up for.

The  site presents a doomsday scenario for liquidation siting that typical Japanese liquidations result in creditors receiving 3% of their claims after ten years. But there is no way that such a cut and dried case like MtGox with a customer database in which every account balance can be verified to the Satoshi by transaction records could ever take more than a year. This is why the 127,000 creditors must unite and retain Japanese counsel to ride herd on the so-called court appointed trustee who has absolutely no incentive to look out for the interests of a bunch foreigners.

Spherious is correct in that when dividing up the remaining fiat the corporate fiat account as it exists now must be adjusted for any stolen fiat from customer accounts. This applies also to any customer Bitcoin that was sold by Mark K for operating expenses. If this "second set of books" cannot be found it can be laboriously recreated by forensic accounting methods. It is highly unlikely that a disinterested "trustee" will commit any resources to a rigorous analysis of the money flow and the Japanese prosecutors have shown no interest. This is why the Sunlot proposal will provide a fairer outcome. They are dedicated to finding out what happened. Without them no one will ever know and Karpeles can walk.

The real (intrinsic) value of Bitcoin is not in its store of value but in the blockchain network and the access it provides to a cheap decentralized source of trust, that can not only quickly, cheaply and securely send any amount of value across the world in an instant but can also authenticate any transaction unrelated to money. If you want to use the blockchain for these purposes you need to buy a ticket which gives you a little bit of space on the blockchain and that ticket is Bitcoin. Just as a UPS label has no intrinsic value without the UPS shipping network so Bitcoin has no value without its network. Imagine a world where there could only be 15 million UPS labels. Do you think they would have more value than the paper they are printed on?

That's what I like about reddit/Bitcoin there's always someone capable of doing a rigorous analysis of any claim. However you cannot analyse this problem with out looking at volume and dispersion. The claim is that all of Marilyn's exhaled O2 is spread out over the entire atmosphere. Therefor:
Volume of Earth's atmosphere = 4.2e9 km^3
X 1e3m^3 /km^3 = 4.2e12m^3
X 1e3cm^3 /m^3 = 4.2e15cm^3
Number of Marilyns molecules = 7.7413e30. 
Number of Marilyns molecules/cm^3 = 7.7413e30/4.2e15 =  1.843e15
 That's 1,843,000,000,000,000 Marilyns O2 molecules per cubic centimeter of air anywhere in the world at any altitude (up to 30,000 ft).
The number looks big because you assumed that each breath was pulling in unique O2 molecules but even correcting for that you can see there's enough of Marilyn's air to go around so that everybody in the world can get a whiff.

In fact this is how a lot of analysts believe Karpeles wiped out his MtGox customer assets-- borrowing customer bitcoins to sell for operating expenses with the expectation of buying them back when they were cheaper, restoring the customer's bitcoins and keeping the profit. Unfortunately he sold at the then high price of $10. When BTC rose to $800 he was caught in the classic short squeeze. Some scenario like this will eventually be revealed by the forensic analysts and be presented at Karpeles's fraud trial.

Theoretically they could reserve a space  for each block of stock certificates on the blockchain  for only one Satoshi for the miniscule transaction fee of 40,000 Satoshis (.0001 BTC). Each time any of the certificates in the block changed ownership NASDAQ would have to come up with an additional 40K Satoshis ($0.10) to pay the miners to authenticate the transfer.

A successful blockchain attack of this nature can only result in the double spending of a valuable colored coin asset, not acquiring ownership of it. The attacker would have to sell an expensive colored coin asset like a house, transfer its title to the buyer, attack the blockchain, then sell the house again by "double spending" the colored coin. The fraud would soon become apparent. So there is very little incentive for mounting an expensive 51% attack.

There is no Bitcoin value associated with an asset like a stock certificate which has been 'colored' by the Colored Coin Protocol (CCP). So there's nothing in the blockchain to appreciate except the value of the stock itself.

The smart money knows how this is going to play out. Karpeles probably made a huge blunder in '13 when he sold Bitcoins belonging to customer accounts at $10 per Bitcoin to pay for operating expenses planning to pay them back when the price went back down. When Bitcoin rallied to $800 he was caught in a classic short squeeze from which there was no recovery. So he invented a story that the Bitcoins had been stolen by hackers exploiting the malleability bug which has been repeatedly debunked by careful analysis of the block chain. He will eventually be convicted of fraud and spend a large part of his young years in prison away from his family.

There was really no fraud committed. The creation and selling of mortgage derivatives like Credit Default Swaps which sank the big investment banks is not illegal.

The mortgage industry willingly complied creating huge mountains of shaky debt that was overrated by the bond rating agencies because it was implicitly backed 100% by the Federal government.

The scenario posed by FreeToEvolve was that very valuable colored coin assets would provide an incentive for a 51% attack that raw Bitcoin values would not.

Therefor this would discourage attacks for colored coins representing expensive assets.

There was a good reason for that. Private blockchains are centralized and require the trust of a consenses of "miners" to guarantee transactions. The miners will have knowledge based signing power over transactions where the Bitcoin blockchain's signing power is computationally based. Eliminating humans and their weaknesses from the settlement process and all of its attendant costs is the big innovation of Bitcoin and is solely responsible for the low costs of maintaining trust in the blockchain. Any "blockchain" that gives human miners the power to double spend will be a disappointment because of the costs of enforcing trust will be almost the same as it is now with secured databases.

What?! If he had real knowledge of the theoretical underpinnings of Bitcoin's valuation he would know that his statement is impossible to realize at this stage. Every proof-of-work public ledger entry validation scheme requires a unit of account or token (Bitcoin) to incentivize the miner. Building a consensus on the value of that token is long and arduous. It has taken Bitcoin and its network of miner nodes 7 years to convince the world it has the integrity to be trusted with lots of money and the world has responded by valuing the token thousands of times its original value . If someone were to create a new coin where would the consensus, i.e. the buyers of that new coin, come from? Certainly not from the nerds, geeks and futuristic innovators that make up the current Bitcoin consensus. They are already invested in Bitcoin and would be unlikely to sell out to invest in another coin which would require another 7 years to prove itself and be ready for blockchain applications that are raring to go NOW. Mr. Wadwha would have to build a new generation of nerds to accept his new coin which would be competing with Bitcoin, a very organic human innovation on par with the invention of language.

This new mining method does not explain where the costs imposed on miners come from that will make attacking the chain financially infeasible. To achieve bitcoin's current barrier to attack, the new PoW would require $1.2 billion of new optical hardware in place and be adding new hardware to the network at a rate of $60 million per day. Anything short of this will result in a much smaller user base, a much lower price for bitcoin. In short, it will be where bitcoin was 10 years ago.
The new PoW also is dependent on new technology  breakthroughs that would drive the incentive for miners to upgrade. These upgrades usually occur in spurts and may not even occur at all leaving the blockchain vulnerable to an attack by just accumulating cheap older optical hardware.

Any human knowledge based signing authority on a blockchain has the capability to subjectively reverse transactions. This is probably what the banks want so that incidents like the hack on the SWIFT network or the DAO exploit can be reversed. This of course introduces costs to indemnify the blockchain against rogue signing authorities  and pay for their integrity and reputation.
So the Bitcoin blockchain will always be more tamper-proof and its contracts more ironclad because of its immunity to any kind of human manipulation.

In fact, it is probably this institutional money that is supporting the price of bitcoin at today's level. If we assume that the sale of the block reward and txn fees is the only source of revenue for the approximate $6 million per day power bill and other overhead costs incurred by miners then to imagine that new small investors are responsible for this huge figure would require the exchanges to sign up from 6,000 to 20,000 new investors each day. (assuming new bitcoin experimenters spent $1000 to $250 on their first bitcoin). This is highly unlikely given all the negative spin lately. There must be some backdoor OTC dealing going on.

I wouldn't expect many investors owning their own Gulfstream V's to purchase tulip bulbs as a store of value but there are plenty of them that buy Bitcoin and invest in its eco-system.

Many early OneCoiners have already claimed to have made small fortunes from OneCoin and indeed the only way the OneCoin fraudsters can entice new members  is with the testimony of early members who got rich quick.

Nevertheless the whole notion of comparing traders with Tether accounts to  traders who have bank loans they can't pay back is inaccurate since Tether positions are not underwater. So the cascading effect of many overleveraged traders driving the price down won't work in the case of Tether since there is only one entity that could be overleveraged enough to panic-- Bitfinex. If Tether holders suspected their Tethers weren't backed by dollars they would indeed make a run on Bitfinex but this wouldn't result in them selling their bitcoin. In fact one the best things they could do would be to convert their Tethers to bitcoin resulting in a run on bitcoin.

They don't have to burn Tethers to control the price because there is no trading market for Tether. Tethers are just chits that can be redeemed for dollars at a later time at Bitfinex. If the Tether holders on Tether-accepting exchanges like Kraken ever thought that they could not exchange them for dollars there would be a panic as Bitfinex tried to process a flood of Tether cash-outs.  Since this is not happening we have to conclude that the Tether account holders are satisfied with the situation.

If you bought 1 BTC on an exchange and transferred it to a wallet on your PC you could look at that UTXO string of hexadecimal digits on the blockchain and say "that's my bitcoin, right thar.". Of course the other part of bitcoin data is the private key which you keep safely encrypted on your PC. Because without the private key your bitcoin on the blockchain is worthless because it can't be sent to anyone.

These newly issued Tethers will not enter the crypto marketplace until they are bought with dollars by traders on the Tether supoorted exchanges.

\&gt; " The loans are being constantly called in, whenever someone returns tether to Bitfinex, Bitfinex removes the tether from circulation and credits the person's Bitfinex account with the corresponding value in USD."
Any conversion of Tether to dollars is done voluntarily by the Tether holder. Bitfinex cannot force a customer to convert his Tether to cash. So the analogy of Tether owners not being able to pay back their "loans" is incorrect.

The sell-off of the MtGox bitcoin recently was to fund the payout of all the claiments in fiat at the rate of $450 per lost bitcoin. So all the claimants get paid off as if  they didn't lose any coin but had to sell it at $450 each 3 years ago. So no one on MtGox has lost anything out-of-pocket. They just lost the opportunity to profit from the huge run-up in price. It's like they were forced to sell all their bitcoin at the price 3 years ago.
The Civil Rehabilitation process will let the creditors recoup some of these opportunity losses by returning to them the remaining  137,000 bitcoin. They will probably get 15&amp; to 18&amp; of their lost bitcoin balances in bitcoins which today are worth $6000 each.

Bitfinex could very well be buying bitcoin with unbacked Tethers by opening accounts on Kraken and funding them with phoney Tethers. These shill accounts on Kraken could trade with each other bidding up the price of bitcoin with the full expectation that the shill Tether accounts on Kraken would never come back to Bitfinex to be claimed for dollars since Bitfinex controlled them.  
Therefor it must be argued that a certain percentage of Tether-accepting exchange volume does not reflect the true demand for bitcoin and this should be reflected in the price. Perhaps the smart money in the market has already computed that and is re-valuing bitcoin accordingly.

It can be proven that burning one Bitcoin is the same thing as giving 1 bitcoin to all the addresses that exist on the blockchain in proportion to the amount of bitcoin in the address. So an address with a 1 bitcoin balance would receive 1/21,000,000 of a bitcoin. This is because removing bitcoin from the supply is deflationary which results in an increased value of the remaining supply.

The smart money-- big investors, etc. anticipate that the blockchain will one day become the settlement platform of choice for all world commerce. Then Bitcoin, as the only coin allowed to pay for transaction space on the blockchain, will become very very valuable even without its use by the public at large.

The total Bitcoin assets of 850,000 consists of not only coin owed to customer accounts by MtGox but also invented coins bought using phony "test" customer accounts with made up cash balances.

It will be known and published when all the claims have been verified.

If encryption without a master key is outlawed then criminals will resort to stegonography in which documents encrypted without backdoor access can be  hidden in image or music files.

It will always be this way. The bitcoin system allows the democratic resolution of contentious conflicts and each time it recovers from one, like the aborted fork last week,  the markets gain more confidence  in it and the price rises. This is how Bitcoin matures and after 8 years why it is so valuable. 
It is the organic nature of Bitcoin that allows it to manage itself.
It is natural for you to be concerned about buying into a multi-billion dollar enterprise that has no executive head in charge. But the Bitcoin architecture (and all of its alt-coin children) has built-in incentives that encourage all stake holders to cooperate and decide contentious issues that will benefit the network.

If you believe that you haven't been paying attention to recent developments. They tried it. Bitcoin Gold failed. BCC is surviving until Coinbase's 10 million customers get access to their BCC coins in January and sell out. Segwit2 is in trouble. It's called brand loyalty. Anyone can make a softdrink that tastes better than Coca Cola too. Social media sites have got to be easiest web apps to code. So let's replace Facebook.
You can clone bitcoin but miners will not mine it because the coin will have no value. You get what is called in the business shit-coins.


The political aspects are only amongst the bitcoin development community not the public. They make the decisions.
Permissioned blockchains which is what you're describing are simply common databases shared by interacting businesses in which transactions are authenticated by bankers sitting at terminals. They are an improvement over what they have now but will be much more costly to maintain and slower performing than a proof-of-work blockchain. So you're comparing apples to oranges.

These are conditions which are only relevant for establishing a miner or authentication node. Any simple computing device like a phone can become a peer and send and receive peer-to-peer bitcoin.
The exponential rise in the consumption of power and mining hardware is a problem as the price of bitcoin rises and mining becomes more profitable. The solution is to create dedicated off-grid renewable power sources similar to what we have now in China where they are producing most of the hash power with under-utilized hydro-electric capacity.

The proof of demand is in the price and trading volume. If there were no demand the miner's bitcoin rewards would flood the market and the price would collapse.
Remember too that the value of bitcoin is not simply that it is a commodity that everyone expects to rise in value. Much of the investment by "smart money" finance people is in anticipation of demand for recording space on the blockchain which they believe will be great when the blockchain becomes a substitute for trusted intermediaries in world commerce.

Bitcoin is also like investing in real estate. There is a limited amount of space on future blocks of the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-11-03 01:11:08
It is a given that off-chain capacity would be required to serve the whole world but all those side chains will need to periodically settle on the main chain which will be more than enough demand to keep bitcoin very valuable.


Bitcoin IS particularly special. Bitcoin required 8 years to prove itself and establish confidence in the marketplace that it is immune to hacking, fraud and political self-destruction. Confidence in bitcoin is best expressed in its market cap which, even adjusted for the recent influx of know-nothing speculators, shows that elite Wall Street money is believing in it. 


The bitcoin eco-system requires a certain bitcoin price to operate so that returns on capital equipment like mining hardware and power are predictable. It would only be possible to create a consensus in the bitcoin eco-sphere to  increase the number of payment units by 10 in case of a severe liquidity crises in bitcoin but by then bitcoin would be worth $1M per unit and so your point would apply only to those buying bitcoin at that price. Not at today's prices.

All of bitcoin's "problems" have been fixed by other coins and blockchain consensus strategies and non of them are worth 5 percent of bitcoin's value. Why? Because no one trusts putting a life-changing amount of wealth into crypto that could be hacked or disappear from a zero-day exploit. Because no one trusts blockchain consensus strategies that can be defeated by corrupt judicial systems or army troops.  That's what gives bitcoin the extraordinary price of $3600. Get used to it.
@_date: 2019-02-04 20:35:25
Not entirely correct. The bitcoin network DOES perform work and therefor buying a share of it through bitcoin IS an investment. It settles billions in value transfers without expensive middle men. It executes smart contracts eliminating lawyers and judges. The current extraordinary price of bitcoin reflects the extent to which the world market believes these capabilities will be in demand in future world commerce. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:58:54
The future value of a transaction on the blockchain does depend on future power rates and hashing hardware costs but these items have an unlimited supply. The blockchain real estate is fixed at 240 blocks per day X 3600 transactions per block = 850,000 transactions per day. So the real value of bitcoin is in this limited transaction recording space which can only be paid for in bitcoin, which of course, itself,  has a limited supply.

This is a great article that showcases the typical misunderstanding of bitcoin in financial circles. The economists/financiers  quoted in the article compare bitcoin to a poker game that requires the addition of new players to maintain its price growth.  It is a mistake to attribute demand for bitcoin only to speculators. The smart money sees the real value of bitcoin not so much as a currency but as the unit of account for the bitcoin network (blockchain and miner nodes, etc.) which is able to automate trust and disrupt business practices worldwide. So most of the big investor demand for bitcoin is to pay for future recording space on the blockchain.  Small  investors and ordinary schmucks seeing it as a speculative lottery just get caught in the updraft from the demand from the smart money.

There is a constant bitcoin demand that absorbs the bitcoin block rewards of the miners that allows them to pay for electricity and their loan payments for their mining hardware. 
The reason the cost of mining seems expensive is because of bitcoin's demand by the public at large. This higher price of bitcoin results in more mining competition which increases the number of miners which increases the difficulty level. The miner's expenses will always be a certain percentage of the total bitcoin market cap.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:29:52
A private blockchain with a digital currency like "citicoin" for a unit of account is an interesting idea since it will shift the costs of securing the ledger from bricks and mortar data centers with their accompanying expensive staffing to inexpensive miners living in apartments or low rent wilderness areas with cheap power. The blockchain, however,  will not truly be decentralized since, without a real market for "citicoin",  the miners will be captives of Citibank, dependent on its support of the currency with dollar conversions.

The miners do the work but the right to use the miner services is only available through bitcoin transaction fees. The blockchain is a finite limited resource that may be in high demand in the future for trust anchoring applications. Investors view owning bitcoin as reserving future transaction recording space on the blockchain so buying bitcoin is a lot like buying cheap real estate that may one day become valuable.
Additionally buying bitcoin and increasing its price makes the network stronger by increasing the hash power hardware necessary to break it. That it why bitcoin is so valuable-- it is the strongest blockchain in existence and has been for ten years.

Permissioned ledgers will allow banks to realize savings by shifting costs of securing the ledger from the bricks and mortar data centers to low cost miners but with miners as employees or contractors to the bank their insufficient independence will introduce an unknown risk to the immutability of the ledger. 
Therefor every permissioned ledger will have to be connected to the Bitcoin blockchain with its mathematically assured predictability of risk. 
What this means for Bitcoin is that every block mined by a permissioned blockchain will be represented by a hash value in the main blockchain meaning that the banks will always have to further sub-contract out assurances of 100% trust to Bitcoin.

Tim Cook's reluctance to cooperate with the FBI is a good business decision. Because it will allow Apple to maintain its closed development platform which is crucial to its business model and success. Terrorists will always have all the encrypted privacy they want on a phone or computer because there is no way to prevent anyone from running those kinds of tools on their phones through any kind of political action. If, for instance, Apple did develop a backdoor to its privacy function then third party developers would simply create backdoor-free encryption apps for the Android phone which has a totally open development environment. And it is technically impossible for the government to prevent shareware encryption tools from running on an Android phone.

What really disqualifies the use of word blockchain as applied to the bank proposals is that the "miners" (or whatever they will be called) will have knowledge based signing power over transactions where the Bitcoin blockchain's signing power is computationally based. Eliminating humans and their weaknesses from the settlement process and all of its attendant costs is the big innovation of Bitcoin and is solely responsible for the low costs of maintaining trust in the blockchain.  Any "blockchain" that gives human miners  the power to double spend will be a disappointment because of the costs of enforcing trust.

Banking regulations stipulate that any entity with power of authenticating transactions on a bearer asset ledger be known to the controller of the ledger.

Let's get real about this issue. Tim Cook's reluctance is all about Apple being able to maintain its closed development environment which is crucial to its business model and success. You will not see mathematicians and cryptographers participating in this debate because to them it's a non-issue. They know there is no way to prevent people from running encryption programs on their phones through any kind of political action. If, for instance, Apple did develop a backdoor to its privacy function then third party developers would simply create encryption apps for the Android phone which has a totally  open development platform. This would cause a mass migration from the iPhone to the Android for all those wanting real security. All FBI and government bloviators should write down the following sentence and stick it on their refrigerator doors--
 "It is technically impossible to prevent someone from running a program on a phone or computer that scrambles the data to make it inaccessible to anyone without the key."

The best the MtGox creditors can get if the remaining coins are returned to them is 202000/850000 = .23 = 23%
of todays value of bitcoin for the number of coins they lost. Where 850,000 = total coins in exchange and 202,000 = total coins lost.
If a typical account had 10 bitcoin then
lost coins = 10
todays value = $100,000
total value of coins returned from MtGox = $100,000 * .23 = $23,000
Still a pretty good return when you consider that the original 10 coins only cost $4000.

True. Because of its portability as a power consumer Bitcoin is very good at power arbitrage which allows bitcoin mining to stand-in for old power plant customers after the plant is no longer useful or for new power plant customers that don't yet exist as communities are slowly built out.
The result is longer life for aging power plants or less risk for new ones since bitcoin mining picks up the tab for operating power plants that do not yet have their full customer bases in place.
This is especially beneficial in the developing countries where the financial risk of constructing power plants with doubtful customer predictions might mean the plant is not built. So bitcoin insures the electrification of India's poor by guaranteeing a paying customer load.
This advantage to the power industry was never considered when bitcoin was invented. This is called serendipity.

Because of its unique portability as a power consumer bitcoin can be used for power arbitrage. Power arbitrage allows bitcoin mining to stand-in for old power plant customers after the plant is no longer useful or for new power plant customers that don't yet exist as communities are slowly built out.
The result is longer life for aging power sources or less risk for new ones since bitcoin mining picks up the tab for operating power plants that do not yet have their full customer bases in place.
This is especially beneficial in the developing countries where the financial risk of constructing power plants with doubtful customer predictions might mean the plant is not built. So bitcoin insures the electrification of India's poor by guaranteeing a paying customer load. 
This advantage to the power industry was never considered when bitcoin was invented. This is called serendipity.

In December during the spike in price, exchanges were creating about 7.5M wallets per month. Exchanges are now seeing about 1.5M wallets created per month. If these wallets represent newcomers and only newcomers are thought to be supporting the price of Bitcoin by absorbing the 1200 miner coins per day (36000/month) then 1.5M/36000  = 41.6 coins per wallet per month. Only the exchanges know how much new wallets are used but 40 coins per month per wallet can be ruled out as the sole source of price support for bitcoin.

You have it backwards. You, being a penniless millennial living in your parents guest room cannot have the same perspective as a fortune 500 director with fiduciary responsibilities. 
Businesses will never allow high value contracts to run on centralized tokens like NEO and Stellar that haven't been proven in the wild for years or that have unverifiable resistance to attack because of complexity like Stellar and Ethereum. Add to that the possibility that they won't be around in 10 years when some critical contract conflict resolution is needed and it is obvious why boards of directors will avoid them.
Bitcoin is the only token that currently has none of these risks and that's why it will prevail. If you doubt that, just look at the price compared to alts.

With low trading volume large price swings happen when when well motivated sellers try to find buyers that are unmotivated. There are always sellers who need to cash out for personal expenses or emergencies like hodlers and miners. This is called well motivated fiat demand. There are very few buyers who desparately need bitcoin to function in their everyday lives. This is called unmotivated bitcoin demand. 
The only thing that can over come this imbalance is to motivate bitcoin demand through practical uses like payment adoption (Lightening Apps) and smart contracts (Rootstock) which will have a FOMO effect as  investors sense the coming domination of the blockchain in economic life.

With its astronomical hashpower requirements bitcoin will always be the Rolls Royce of trust platforms. That is when there needs to be absolutely zero risk of transaction tampering the user will pay for the bitcoin chain. 
As the block reward becomes less a part of the hash-power miner expense it must naturally be paid for by transaction fees. Because of its limited resource of a fixed block size per 10 minutes Bitcoin will increasingly be used for trust anchor applications like recording hash proofs and executing self-enforcing smart contracts. Since these applications will be cost competitive with the use of lawyers and court rooms a $50 or $100 transaction fee would seem very cheap which would more than cover today's $5 million/day mining electricity bill. Whether charging a $50 fee to establish a LN channel is feasible would depend on how competitive LN payments are with credit cards 50 years from now. It could be that LN payment providers would simply see this as a cost of doing business much like VISA does when they create and ship a credit card.

Metcalf's law predicts the value of a network with the ability to expand infinitly.

These kinds of permissioned blockchains may be adequate for some business contracts but not useful where immunity from political, legal and hacking exploits must be a 100% impossibility.

Only computer people and mathematicians got into bitcoin early because they looked beyond Bitcoin the currency and saw the incredible ability of the blockchain to automate trust. This is why I took a lot of risk in the early years  even after losing 100 bitcoins on Mt. Gox I bought more because I believe it is a human innovation equivalent to the invention of money. 
Since bitcoin is the unit of account for the blockchain, todays bitcoin buyers are merely investing in this wonderful bitcoin network that has the ability to transform the way the world does business not through bitcoin as a world currency but as a ticket to use the blockchain for all forms of commercial activity.

This is partially correct. Most of their customers will be going long. A few might go short. If the quantity of long bitcoin is in equilibrium with the quantity shorts then the winnings for the long contracts can be paid for with the losses from the short contracts. Any difference between long and short can be covered by a futures contract on a third party exchange for exposure to a bitcoin  price rise.
The rub is that all of this can be carried out without purchasing any bitcoin. If bitcoin were to suddenly triple in value the long contracts would get paid in fiat from a combination of the short losses on the Robinhood exchange plus the short losses on the  futures exchange all settled in cash.

$7B = 700K bitcoins per day changing hands but most of these are day trades with same money cycling through the order books. Some are even wash trades. The 7B figure nowhere near represents new money coming into the market which = $ amount to purchase 1200 miner coins + $ amount to purchase sale of coins due to profit taking. 
So without a change in fundamentals that would cause a spike in profit taking the Gox coins must be held accountable since they doubled the amount of miner coins (1200) the market was used to absorbing on a daily basis. This disrupted the equilibrium and tipped the market to bear.

How does one know that vacant land is cheap?
Holding bitcoin is like holding the deed to undeveloped real-estate, where the real estate is future transaction recording space on the blockchain. Bitcoin is now useful since it pays for values transfers and securing trust transactions on the blockchain but the demand for that use is nowhere near the speculative demand for its anticipated universal use when the bitcoin/blockchain will be a settlement platform for the world. Then the blockchain's 144 blocks per day will be in great demand with bitcoin the only way to pay for their use.

It IS used to disincentivize fraud attempts since the attacker must consider total costs including power costs when creating a series of false blocks that would fool the network. 
In fact the enormous cost of creating 51% of the hash power is one of the things that is driving the price of bitcoin upwards. Smart investors realize that as a 51% attack becomes less economically feasible the odds of bitcoin ever failing due to one becomes very low. So this makes bitcoin look more secure long term.

Yes. Once you receive a bank charter and begin accepting deposits you can borrow from the Federal government many times the value of those deposits to lend it out to your customers. This is called fractional reserve since only a fraction of the money loaned out actually exists on the bank's books.
This system is necessary to maintain liquidity in the economy since if only the amount deposited in the bank could be loaned out there simply would not be enough money for new businesses to open or to purchase cars and houses and the economy would grind to a halt.
Bitcoin cannot replace this system since you cannot create bitcoin out of thin air like dollars. If banks were allowed only to loan out the bitcoin that they had on deposit then the economy would crash.
The best the banks could do in a bitcoin world would be to loan out bitcoin or ethereum based tokens on a side chain that would duplicate the functionality of a fractional reserve system.

The value of bitcoin is not the bitcoin itself but in the network that authenticates the transactions and mathematically insures that no counterfeit bitcoins are created and no bitcoins are spent twice. The earthshaking phenomenon of bitcoin is that this same mechanism that guarantees bitcoin value transfers also can be used as a source of notary trust in any kind of transaction in any industry. So even if bitcoin does not make it as a widely used currency it will become indispensable to the world economy as industry and governments come to rely on blockchain applications that run their day to day operations.

This is viewed by investors as a finite resource that can only be paid for in bitcoin. It is like real estate.  Gold has no such value since it can't validate contracts and track assets. So only a fraction of the value of bitcoin is due to its atteaction as store of value.

The real value of Bitcoin is the network that it runs on, since the same software algorithms (mining) that are used to confirm bitcoin value transfers can be used also  to confirm any kind of agreement between individuals or corporations. Owning bitcoin is like buying shares in the blockchain network, which, with its miners, nodes and mining technology, is able to automate trust for contracts and asset tracking across all industries. This network is a finite resource that must be paid for in bitcoin whenever used for these other non-bitcoin applications. Investors believe that with a future world dependent on blockchain applications the 21 million bitcoins that are allowed to exist are going to be in great demand.

Bitcoin investors are buying a share of the Bitcoin network. The value of bitcoin is not the bitcoin itself but in the miners and nodes that authenticate the transactions. The  attraction of this network to investors is that this same mechanism that guarantees bitcoin value transfers also can be used as a source of notary trust in any kind of transaction in any industry. So when the blockchain becomes indispensable to the day to day operation of the world economy owning a ticket to use this network (bitcoin) becomes an attractive investment. Since only 21 million tickets to use the blockchain (bitcoins) can exist investors believe they will be in great demand when the whole world becomes dependent on blockchain applications.

The only way Bitcoin can have any value and be useful is if large numbers of people buy and hold it. In that sense buyers and "hoarders" of Bitcoin are providing development capital that is necessary to make the blockchain network useful. These "hoarders" are actually investors every bit as much as were venture capitalists investing in Twitter and Google in their early days. The big advantage of Bitcoin is that it is not closed off to ordinary investors as were the hot ideas of Google and Twitter. So not only is holding Bitcoin as good as buying stock in a company but it allows the investor to participate in equity appreciation before the IPO something that you could do only if you were an investment banker or employee of the startup.

 UBI is actually the killer app for bitcoin. UBI may work at first by giving everyone $1000/month but eventually it will have to be changed to a matching grant system where if you actually work 10 or 20 hours per week the gov gives you $1000 more per month. This a great application for the bitcoin blockchain since there will need to be a way to authenticate hours worked to qualify for the additional income. No actual bitcoin will be distributed to the public but the blockchain will just be used as the trust platform to prevent fraudulent work claims through smart contracts. The bitcoin demand will come from employers who will need a few satoshis to put their hiring records on the blockchain so the additional UBI money can be claimed by the worker.

There is a weakness of bitcoin as a replacement for fiat government sponsored money. Bitcoin by itself cannot be used to replace fiat in the banking system since it can't be replicated like fiat when the demands of the economy require more liquidity. If bitcoin replaced dollars it would repeat the situation the banking industry faced  in the 1840s-50s when all currency had to be backed by gold. Because the supply of gold was fixed there wasn't enough gold backed dollars being printed to run the American economy so the banks started printing their own money to fill in the gap.
Bitcoin would have to use the same model that banks in the 1850's used to respond to this kind of  liquidity crises. I would imagine that Wells Fargo and Citibank would have to take deposits of bitcoin and issue their own bitcoin backed tokens to meet the demands for loans from their customers. This is the only way bitcoin could ever be integrated into the economy in a scenario where  the bitcoin price was stable -- rising 2-3&amp; per year.
Another scenario could happen where the the bitcoin price was rising 20&amp; per year. In that case the banks could loan out the deflated bitcoin thereby increasing the bitcoin liquidity in the economy while still having enough profit left over to pay the depositor interest on his bitcoin deposits.
This is totally new paradigm for economics. interesting to see where it will go.

"There is no end game whatsoever..."
The end game is solving the throughput issue which will eventually split bitcoin into a version where the blockchain is a settlement layer and one where the blockchain is the cash layer which we have now. 
The reason for bitcoins price resiliency after what was supposed to be a disastrous fork to Bcash was passing the test of its community configuration management model in which all stake holders stated their cases, released the new software and allowed the market to decide. You can't get more organic than that.
So as bitcoin converges on a solution to solve the throughput issue (with less fear of forks among investors) any kind of calamitous software release becomes less likely and this is reflected in the price recovery after the hardfork.  
"Right now the vast majority of all mining is done in China"
The largest miner in China has 25% of the hashpower. With substantial investment in mining hardware there is a powerful incentive for the 10 Chinese miner consortia NOT to conspire to collapse the price of bitcoin whereupon their investments would become worthless. 
There is a political risk that the Chinese government could order the the miners to produce a block that gave themselves a huge amount of bitcoins but once it was discovered there would be an immediate hardfork that isolated the Chinese from the bitcoin network. So what would be the point in doing it?

Ownership  does not imply control in class B stock. Bitcoin is like a class B stock. A stock without voting privileges. But very much a stock since the owner of it enjoys profit participation from the use of the blockchain. So buying bitcoin is like buying real estate on the blockchain which, like Manhattan real estate, is a limited resource.  With only 240 blocks per day and 3600 transactions per block it isn't hard to see that if the whole world is trying to stuff all their smart contracts and asset tracking transactions into this small space the cost of the space will skyrocket.

You, like most critics miss the point of what the PoW blockchain is and how it differs from a database. The PoW blockchain truly distributes trust throughout the world  where it can't be compromised by governments and other dishonest actors; where government and business blockchains (also called permissioned blockchains) will put all their faith in the honest behavior of a few people to whom they have given editing privileges of their blockchain. No one will trust this kind of blockchain because any court can order a change to a transaction and anyone with editing privileges can eventually be corrupted. 
The whole point of the PoW blockchain therefor is to distribute trust (that the blockchain will not be corrupted) as widely as possible geographically to ensure it can't be politically or criminally compromised.

Even if personal spending was linked to savings as you claim there was still a liquidity crises in industry and agriculture that required the extraordinary intervention of banks printing their own currency to satisfy the credit demand. This same crises can be expected with a non-reproduce able currency like bitcoin. I could see the required expansion of the money supply occuring through the deflationary property of bitcoin (20&amp; per year) creating more apparent value in bitcoin deposits. But this bitcoin could not be lent out and would only be allowed  to back bank issued tokens which would be loaned out to borrowers on the Lightening Network.

Your theory of a bitcoin only monetary system doesn't explain where credit comes from. If the entire amount of bitcoin on deposit in a bank is loaned out and there is additional demand for home loans where does the bitcoin come from to loan out to make more home loans. This is what happens with fiat currency. There is simply not enough cash on deposit to meet the demands for credit so it is multiplied by fractional reserve.
So until you can explain where credit will come from like I have tried to in my post your theory is totally impractical.

This is a weakness of bitcoin as a replacement for paper money. Bitcoin cannot be used to replace fiat in the banking system since it can't be replicated like fiat when the demands of the economy require more liquidity. It is like gold was in the 1840s-50s. There wasn't enough gold backed dollars  to run the American economy so the banks started printing their own money to fill in the gap. 
Bitcoin will use the same model as  the 1850's banks where Wells Fargo and Citibank will take deposits of bitcoin and issue their own bitcoin backed  tokens to meet the demands for loans from their customers. This is the only way bitcoin could ever be integrated into the economy... IF the bitcoin price was stable.
Another scenario could happen where the the bitcoin price was rising 20%-30% per year and the banks could loan out the deflated bitcoin thereby increasing the liquidity in the economy while still having enough profit left over to pay the depositor interest on his bitcoin.
This is totally new paradigm for economics. interesting to see where it will go.

Thanks for that.

The bitcoin that the banks loan out will be so valuable that no one will want to use it. It will be appreciating in value at maybe  2&amp; per month. The bank's customers need a token that is universally acceptable for all business uses and can be redeemed at a predictable exchange rate for bitcoin equal to the token/bitcoin exchange rate that they received when they took out the loan. 
This model of course depends on compensating the bitcoin depositor for letting the bank manage his bitcoins. That means the bank must pay interest to the bitcoin depositor over and above the natural deflationary appreciation of bitcoin.

It could work if the coin is trust anchored to bitcoin or ethereum through a contract. The Petro could be linked to oil by contractually giving each Petro a claim on every barrel of oil sold to the international oil brokers. This would be in the form of an ethereum contract which would withhold payment to Venezuela until four signatures approved the sale-- seller, buyer, petro coin owner and a third party escrow witness.
Nobody would cash out their Petros because since they are linked to reserves they would be much more valuable than a single barrel. It would be only after Maduro defaulted that Petro owners could get their money back.

In fact it requires only about 23,000 Bitcoins to transfer the annual volume of $300 billion in international remittances  if the transactions are spread out evenly over the whole year. To see how this is calculated [reddit!]( So obviously the quantity of Bitcoin held briefly for payments is not going to provide sufficient demand for it to acheive a high enough or stable value. So investors, "hoarders" or whatever you want to call them will be necessary to offset this potential lack of demand from the payments sector.

The same PoW algorithm that authenticates bitcoin balances and transfers can be used to prove agreements between business entities without human intermediaries, in essence, supplying a cheap source of trust.  It's called smart contracts. It's the reason Ethereum was forked. It's the reason they're developing Particl and Ivy. 


It is more likely to investors that Bitcoin will achieve significant adoption  first through off chain contract activity than with off chain value transfer (LN) with both, of course, using the main bitcoin blockchain as the trust anchor. Significant adoption would be 5000 transactions/sec. Bitcoin for smart contracts are less intrusive politically at that level of adoption than bitcoin for value transfer which would require a big government buy-in.

As you can see by my last post where its possible to spend $300 billion using only 23,000 Bitcoins, the use of Bitcoin for just purchasing  (fiat--&gt; Bitcoin --&gt;fiat) has a miniscule effect on the demand and therefore the price.  Shoppers owning Bitcoin, however, make the demand somewhat better since they will probably keep the same amount in their Bitcoin wallets that they have in their checking accounts ~ $500. But you have to assume that the merchant on the other end of the transaction will still want to immediately convert his received Bitcoin to fiat. So that leaves a float of Bitcoin demand of $500 X number of wallets in use which = 3,000,000 (current number of blockchain.info wallets) X 500 = $1,500,000,000 or 1,500,000,000/$250 = 6,000,000 BTC which is half of the BTC in existence.

If you distribute the random data (encrypted message) such that it occupies only the least significant bit of a 32 bit color value there's no way to tell whether a color value is real or is a bit of an encrypted message. The sender simply adds the encrypted message to the color values and receiver subtracts it. Anyone eavesdropping can do what the receiver does but has no way of knowing whether the random data was captured by a camera or is a message.

What makes Bitcoin subject to Gresham is the fact that it can be used as payment and therefor competes with fiat currencies as a medium of exchange. The problem with Bitcoin as a payment  is that it has become so valuable that any time it is used the owner feels compelled to replace it, a process fraught with risk and friction. Hence we see a lot less transactions on the chain.

To do this you can estimate how smart hodlers are by how  rich they are and you can estimate their bullishness by what percent of their wealth they are committing to Bitcoin. 
The financial elite's opinion on Bitcoin is worth exponentially more than the  ordinary hodler since their opinions, while worthy in their own right,  are also backed by the analysis of expensive advisors.

OneCoin conceals the Ponzi reality of this scheme by not collecting a monthly fee from new members. Old members get paid off by the exhorbitant "training" fee required of new members  which if amortized over the years amounts to a monthly fee AND the requirement that new members purchase coins whose price is set by OneCoin management. There is no market exchange for OneCoin where true price discovery could be realized. OneCoin simply jacks up the price that new members must pay for tokens which of course enriches the old members with their cheaper purchased coins and, of course, the OneCoin fraudsters. 
OneCoin is a closed loop with no money coming in from outside their system, money that would come from the sales of services (such as blockchain transaction processing) or demand for their tokens. All the wealth they produce comes from payments from members and the artificially set value of member tokens.

Experienced traders can smell what happened all the way from Wall Street. Karpeles probably made a huge blunder two years ago when he sold Bitcoins belonging to customer accounts at $10 per Bitcoin to pay for operating expenses and the seizure of $30M by the Feds, planning to pay them back when the price went back down. When Bitcoin rallied to $800 he was caught in a classic short squeeze from which there was no recovery. So he invented a story that the Bitcoins had been stolen by hackers exploiting the malleability bug which has been repeatedly debunked by careful analysis of the block chain. He will eventually be convicted of fraud and spend a large part of his young years in prison away from his family.

If encryption without backdoor access is outlawed then determined terrorists will resort to stegonography in which messages can be "illegally" encrypted and hidden in image or music files. There is no way to detect information encoded with stegonography since the hidden message appears as random noise added to the pixel data which imperceptibly affects the red-green-blue values of the image. The authorities can then ban stegonography tools which themselves can be distributed and hidden as .gif and .jpg files . So any encryption impairment has work-arounds for any determined terrorist.

Banks can benefit somewhat from private blockchains by shifting costs of securing their ledger from the bricks and mortar data centers to low cost miners but with miners as employees or contractors to the bank their insufficient independence will introduce an unknown risk to the immutability of the ledger.
Therefor every permissioned ledger will have to be connected to the Bitcoin blockchain with its mathematically assured predictability of risk.
What this means for Bitcoin is that every block mined by a permissioned blockchain will be represented by a hash value in the main blockchain meaning that the banks will always have to further sub-contract out assurances of 100% trust to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is an asset class unlike gold or real estate, in fact, it is a class by itself in economic history. The fiat spent buying or "hoarding" Bitcoin does just as much good for the economy as investing in a productive enterprise like Apple. This is because the block chain and its unique property of crowd sourcing trust is only enabled by the price of Bitcoin having sufficient value and stability to make it practical for larger transfers. The more traders the less volatility and the greater demand.

This is something that the alt-coin risk Bitcoin skeptics need to take heed of. It will be impossible  for an alt-coin to gain enough value to make mining it worthwhile or allow its use for value transfer at a significant scale since all the Gulfstream driving venture capital elites have already cast their lots with Bitcoin, as have all the early-adopting techies who already own Bitcoin and, as can be seen by the rude posts on this topic, hold any other "shit" coin in contempt. In other words Bitcoin probably already has an insurmountable momentum that will propel it with all its faults to domination. Why?
Because new technologies as game-changing as the blockchain/bitcoin must evolve slowly, one positive Wall Street Journal article at a time. It's all about perception in the public mind which over a period of two years has received daily doses of information on Bitcoin, some negative, some positive, forming an opinion in the public consciousness which will be impossible to dislodge in the short term by upstarts which say they have the greatest thing since sliced bread. 
Think of Bitcoin as a brand. It is now  like the "Coca-Cola" of digital currencies. Sure "Doge-Cola" and "Dark-Cola" will come along and they're probably pretty good but will they ever attain the market share of Coke?

When the BCC miners perform a hard fork on August 1st all bitcoin holders  will have their bitcoin balances duplicated on the forked chain. So all bitcoin holders including you will have twice as many bitcoins but divided among two blockchains. Bitcoin holders who posses their own keys on a hardware or software wallet can export a copy of their coins to the BCC chain and begin trading them for whatever their worth. Coinbase does not at this time intend to allow any interaction with the new BCC chain by its customer accounts therefor preventing Coinbase customers from realizing any value that the new BCC coins may have. What they intend to do with this residual value is not known at this time. But because of the obvious fiduciary liabilities involved you can assume that if a market for the BCC coin develops Coinbase will find a way for its "stranded" BCC coins to escape.
By warning everyone to remove their coins before the hardfork Coinbase is absolving themselves of the financial liability for denying their customers missed trading opportunities during and immediately after the fork.

1. Workers will always want to store some of their excess productivity for like retirement and the kids education. If this is stored in bitcoin in our theoretical bitcoin world then it must be productive if bitcoin is going to compete with fiat.
2. Just spending all the bitcoin you earn doesn't address the need of putting big hunks of capital toward enterprise development, the thing that investment banks do now. It involves workers pooling their excess bitcoin in banks and letting the bankers distribute it to  the most promising new businesses. Pretty much exactly what they do now.

There will be a threat to BTC prices since after the split there will be two or more networks serving blockchains each of which will have 13M bitcoins for a total of 26M bitcoins. This means that all the demand for bitcoins and its functionality could be split between two or more chains. This is a rejection of the original value proposition of bitcoin which is a maximum of 21M coins. If the minority chain hangs on as a back-up to the winning chain bitcoin will have a total coin capacity of 42M not the 21M advertised.

True. Any prudent investor that wanted to diversify into bitcoin  would typically allocate 1% of his investment portfolio or $10,000 for a millionaire. The additional demand created would be $10,000 X 36,000,000 = $360,000,000,000 or about 3 times the current market cap of bitcoin. So that would increase the price 3 fold to about $15,000. And that is assuming that investors that were not millionaires were not buying bitcoin.  If the 360,000,000 ordinary non-millionaire people wanted to invest only $1000 in bitcoin the additional demand created would be $1,000 X 360,000,000 = $360,000,000,000 or another 3 times the current market cap. So that would increase the price another 3 fold to $30,000 per bitcoin.

Bitcoin will actually benefit the electrical power industry through power arbitrage. Because bitcoin mining is portable, a poor developing nation can use mining to consume the output of expensive power plants before the communities they were built to serve are built out and can start paying for the plant. Having an immediate customer in place consuming 100% of the power on day one was never possible before bitcoin.

Gates' position on Bitcoin is very consistent with his almost missing another early technological breakthrough-- the internet. Among Microsoft staff in the '90's Bill Gates was famously reluctant to see the internet as anything worthy of Microsoft's attention. Finally, a tech VP took him out to the woodshed -- spending an evening with him browsing the web, which apparently he had never bothered to do on his own.  The result was that a business case was quickly made for the Internet at Microsoft and tcp/ip and IE was finally released with Windows.

Actually a remittance enterprise would not be required to hold any Bitcoin, acquiring them as needed for each transfer. This would certainly be a good business practice in a stable Bitcoin market where he could expect to buy and sell at the same price. In this case the total Bitcoin demand for $300B per year in remittances would be: 
(Total world wide remittances per year X Time required to hold Bitcoin until confirmation) / Price of Bitcoin
* Total world wide remittances per year = $300B
* Time needed to hold Bitcoin until confirmation = 1 / (365 days/yr  X 24 hrs/day X 6 blocks/hr) = 
                                                                                                                                  1/52,560 yrs/block
* Price of Bitcoin = $250
* Dollar value of BTC pool = $300B X (1 /52,560) = $5,707,762
* Number of Bitcoins in pool =  $5,707,762/$250 = 22,831
This assumes that the transactions will be evenly distributed over the 52,560 blocks per year. Surges in demand at peak hours and paydays will grossly inflate the requirements for the pool and will definitely encourage a remitter to maintain his own pool.
Also, these values could triple if the purchase and redemption of vehicle BTC required block confirmation.

"Your TREZOR is protected by a PIN code, which can be up to 9 digits between 1 and 9. There are 6561 possible 4 digit PINs for the TREZOR. If you choose a good PIN, it will take hundreds of thousands of guesses to guess your PIN. Each time you enter a wrong PIN, the wait time increases by a power of 2. After the first few failures, you have to wait several seconds before you’ll be able to try another PIN. Even just trying the top 20 PINs would take about 6 days(150 hours). Trying 30 PINs would take around 17 years. Trying 100 random PINs would take a VERY LONG time."

My prediction is that the banks will have to create and issue "bankcoins" (colored coins) that run as payment channels on sidechains to meet credit demands just as they did the 1840's with banknotes backed by gold.

Banks are necessary to supply cash liquidity and credit to make the economy run. Bitcoin holders are not expert enough to safely allocate capital to credit worthy enterprises. That's what banks do.
If everyone was paid in bitcoin and they kept their savings on their Trezors there would be a another great depression.

The poor locals you're referring to who are the early customers of a new power plant could benefit from the cheaper power for the several years that it took to build out or hook up the full community. But this cost savings would only be temporary and when weighed against the prospect of not getting a power plant at all because of cost would certainly be not worth it in the long run.

To finance your hacking scenario the hacker consortium would, assuming the hashrate fell to 20,000,000 Th/s, need to purchase about $6,000,000,000 worth AntMiner S9 13.5T at $7,788 each to mount a 51% attack. It's plain to see that even a nation state like North Korea could not accomplish this and for what purpose to even try? $6B investment thrown into the shit hole just to say you broke bitcoin? That's the part of bitcoin that you don't understand. It has built in incentives that de-incentivise mischief. 
So it is safe to say that the exorbitant cost of electricity in securing the blockchain is worth something-- the guarantee that any nation like the US could never reverse or change a transaction.

If bitcoin becomes a universally adopted alternative currency
then with a finite number permitted to exist (21M) the current number of wallets, about 1M, will have to expand to at least a billion (a factor of x1,000) At the current bitcoin price ($800) there is insufficient liquidity ($18B) to allow everyone to have a wallet with even only a $100 in it. Acheiving that level of  liquidity would require a bitcoin price of $4166. And that's not including the corporate and merchant wallets which MIGHT be storing thousand or millions of dollars.

The block mining algorithm is actually very simple. It's a kind of lottery with all the miners trying to guess the target hash value by randomly (or strategically) varying the value of the "nonce" in the current block and then computing the hash with that new nonce value and seeing whether it agrees with the target hash value which automatically created for each new block. If it does agree the miner gets 10 bitcoins.  The target hash value is a 64 place number that is automatically generated by the system for each new block. The nonce is a four byte feild within the block that the miner can change to try to get the hash value of the block to equal the target hash value. The by product of all this busy work ( technically called "proof-of-work" by crytographers) is the mathematical authentication of all the bitcoin transactions that occurred in the world over the last 6 minutes. It is necessary to make all the miners work for about 6 to 10 minutes on each block so that 1)only 60 bitcoins are create an hour and 2) a significant amount of resources are committed to the block authentication (mining) process to discourage fraudulent mining.

Mining has always been profitable at any price. Mining is very scalable and modular. With all of the mining hardware units (like antminers) in existence miners will merely power down a fraction of their capacity to meet the difficulty level with profitability.

No you don't. The original 10 bitcoin you deposited with the bank is not in circulation. It is an "IOU for 10 bitcoins" in the bank's ledger.
The bank can only loan out real bitcoin. So once it has loaned out 9 bitcoins there is only one bitcoin left on deposit. 
As I posted before the bank can only leverage the 10 bitcoin on deposit by creating its own colored coin and backing it with the 10 bitcoin on deposit whose value everyone believes will be constantly rising.

If the blockchain splits and your father does nothing he cannot lose. He will instantly have double his bitcoin balances distributed equally in two coins-- Bitcoin and Bitcoin classic. As the market takes sides as to which coin is better the value of each  coin will change to reflect the favored coin. It is only if your father takes sides in the debate and buys or sells his two coin balances accordingly that he can lose or profit.
The hard fork will be a great opportunity for the tech savvy to profit as the frightened noobies bail out because they don't understand what's going on..

In the fractional reserve system the Federal Reserve can create new dollars simply by printing them and loaning them out to banks when the demand for credit from the economy exceeds the amount the banks have on hand. This is impossible with bitcoin since bitcoin can only be created by the mining process at 35 BTC per block.

Whenever extra liquidity is needed the price of BTC will rise causing normally insignificant Satoshi decimal places to become more valuable. With 2,100,000,000,000,000 units of value (Satoshis) in the system it is
unlikely the world will run out of liquidity.

Unfortunately for your case when you add up all the treasuries, corporate bonds, home mortgages, car loans, college loans, corporate stock demanded by the economy and compare it with the amount of worker savings, (both middle class and super rich) there will simply be not enough bitcoin to  supply these credit demands even when your stringent standards are applied. 
Some kind of fractional reserve will always be in our future. Our best case would be to severely restrict it by holding bank executives personally liable for failed loans or other capitol placements.

This whole idea of America recreating small town America of the '30s is so appealing but, unfortunately, has some problems. The population is now so dependent on mass produced industrial agriculture that any initiative to walk back food production to family farming would result in mass starvation. I doubt whether the author of this blog, MB, has really drilled down into practical effects of what he is proposing. He should probably contact a reputable economics department and ask them to model the Dual Process. For instance convincing millions of people to move from urban centers to rural locations where the food is produced would probably result in some form of state coercion similar to Pol Pots horror in Cambodia in the 1970's. The abandonment of current agricultural and transportation infrastructure used to supply the cheap food we enjoy today would result in steep declines in the values of pension funds, the part owners of that infrastructure, which would require huge federal indemnification.
It is these kind of details that the the "end of capitalism" crowd avoids talking about which is why we never see any detailed policy recommendations from them. So the Dual Process is unfortunately just a dream for the tattooed hipsters that MB uses to fill up the lecture halls but can have no hope of practical application.

The value of bitcoin is mostly due to the potential value of the bitcoin network consisting of the miners, their hardware and the nodes which verify each block. This is seen by investors as something that has never before seen in history-- crowd sourcing trust with all the cost efficiencies  that come with that.
The immediate demand of bitcoin for practical uses is small. Theoretically, the number of bitcoins to  do all the worlds money transfers each day is appallingly small-- about 2000 if the coin is converted to fiat just before and just after the transaction.  That is, only 2000 BTC are necessary to transact the value in an average block.

There's no question that bitcoin is deflationary with it doubling in value every week. No wonder they're hoarding. That latte that cost $5.00 worth of BC today actually costs the buyer $10.00 when he looks back on it a week later. With Mt Gox reporting an open interest of 20,000 accounts per day there are simply not enough bitcoins in circulation (12 million) to meet that kind of demand. So a run up in price is inevitable. With the BC currency deflating there is no mechanism like a central banking authority to increase the supply to meet the demand so that economic transactions can be carried out. When the US economy outgrew the supply of gold and silver in the 1880's the only solution was to print bank notes. Therefor I propose that banks issue paper currency backed by bitcoins. You heard it here first!

Most Bitcoin enthusiasts ignore the fact that the bank's fractional reserve paradigm is necessary to maintain adequate liquidity in the economy. If everyone just stored their bitcoins under their mattress (in a Trezor) there would not be enough currency to operate the economy.
So some form of lending "bank-bitcoins" pegged to real bitcoins will be necessary to keep the economy functioning the way it does now. And this will be the Bitcoin version of fractional reserve.

Bitcoins fundamental value will come from its use as a universally adopted alternative currency.
With a finite number permitted to exist (21M) the current number of wallets, about 1M, will have to expand to at least a billion (a factor of x1,000). At the current bitcoin price ($750) there is insufficient liquidity ($18B) to allow everyone to have a wallet with even only a $100 in it. Achieving that level of liquidity would require a bitcoin price of $4166. You can extrapolate further increases in value by including the corporate and merchant wallets which would presumably be required to store thousand or millions of dollars. For a store of value independent of the fiat currencies bitcoin would be competing with gold whose privately held value is around $4-5  trillion ( at $1200/oz).  5/200 = 2.5% Since bitcoin would be competing with gold a $2 trillion estimate for bitcoin holdings as a store of value wouldn't be far off the mark.
