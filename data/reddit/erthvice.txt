Make it provably fair! That is very important! Now I would guess it is not fair, as the dealer seemed very very lucky (or was it just luck...). Very good graphics and usability is great! Don't redo the design - keep it simple, direct like this! Great work! Keep it up. If you make it provably fair, I will promote the site to my gambling friends!

If it is bitcoin protocol the MITM attack is handled by the protocol __as long as you verify the destination address (and amount) on the display__ i.e. there need to be some way of verifying the bitcoin address (or the whatever name system used) on the display before acception. Then it is impossible to attack as the keys are kept on the card. The middle man cannot modify the transaction.

Will never work! Bitcoin people cannot have reputation as identity is not permanent, i.e. your identity can without high cost be thrown away and recreated. This makes ratings useless (as they are in the US where you can just walk away and restart, even to another state) Also, there needs to be a arbitration and enforcement for non payment. How do you force someone to pay bitcoin when it is impossible to known than anyone even has bitcoins? In principle all this could be all be added to the risk side of things, but this then leads to 20-30% interest due to all the scammers this will attract.
Anyone investing in kickstarter type ventures with bitcoin should expect many projects to be scams.

The phones are to complicated to be trusted. They are universal computers with all their bugs and layers. If you worked with crypto-trust system you would see the difference. Why do you think banks or financial trading institutions requires hardware dongles/keys for logon or signing things on the web? The card is  (should be) a tamper-resistant simple keystore plus a display.
However, there are many things about this card and bitcoin that is not clear how they intend to handle, e.g. what about the blockchain?

Much work for little benefit. The merchant is interested in getting the money, not who you are, according to someone third party. A much more efficient scheme would be to insure the transaction, so it can be accepted on 0 comfirms. You have someone with whom you are known and who has resources (e.g. mtgox, blockchain etc.) They would issue a certificate saying, "we insure transactions up to 100 BTC for 6 blocks time from this person". When you make a payment you sign your transaction with the certificate. The merchant could book the risk with the insurer to avoid overextending risk. Many variations could apply, but the main theme is insurance, and no need to id to the merchant!

2nd point is just impossible unless hardware safety is added. An infected Win machine can subvert anything you can throw at it and it is a waste of time to aim for that. As good as possible however is the right aim. But do not oversell it.
In the long run, either third party trust (bank) or tamper resistant hardware add-on will be needed for that.

I agree fully, "it can only go up"-persons are a waste of everyones time! Most people are ignorant idiots that believe they have the true knowledge of the nature of the world. And, bitcoin adopters are no excpetion, I am afraid. I personally think bitcoin will eventually succeed and increase in value but I also am convinced there is a very clear risk of bitcoin failing to win interest of a larger group of people and thus just disappear.
@_date: 2012-06-20 18:53:30
First there is no double spend protection without confirmations. But you can always respend an unconfirmed transaction. It is in the protocol and is as easy for a phone as a desktop BTC-client as a card... The respend is just also an unconfirmed transaction.

There a many antidotes to a 10% network attack. I think you are a persistent ignorant not to see this. In the end you will need 51% for it to work in any profitable way, in any other case the good guys can just ignore your work and still have a chain.

FIX interface? Is it not time for that?
@_date: 2011-09-22 19:50:15
What can be done? A good question but I think a lot. Also, the whole case is when sb accepts 0 confirmations tx which you arguably should not (unless a special set of conditions are met, which I will not mention here but that basically insures against serious double spend). One counter measure could be to have a group of nodes trusting each other and be widely distributed in the network to monitor propagation race conditions. The nodes could warn each other of double spend events, and could refrain from building "on top" of a block that includes a conflicting transaction unless a majority of the trusted nodes know about it (and you can add other conditions). The main point is that a small minority will have a hard time behaving bad without being ignored in the long run.
@_date: 2011-09-20 22:27:21
I think you have it mostly wrong in your blog. In this particular case 
- confirmation times are blazingly fast comparing apples to apples. Visa, ACH wires etc, take far longer (and cost a lot more) to be *permanent*. Quick-at-shop-transactions can be built on top of bitcoins the same way as visa cards etc. There are numerous ways, but one is just identify yourself and you would be held accountable for double spends, thus a shop could accept the transaction as it receives it after a few seconds. If it is double spent you are punished. This needs trusted part but it can be handled by bank deposit or other asset warrant from the customer.
- blockchain is very safe at the current numbers. You forget 
  1. Existing mining only take margin cost into account (excluding capital costs) whereas an attacker must take capital costs into account, and not only that will have to write off capital at a short period to to account for utter failure of trust in the bitcoin system.
  2. A lot of existing participants will have interest to monitor and validate transactions due to the their operations (business, e.g. exchanges, stores, etc) and would be prepare to mine small scale at loss in order to support their self interest.
  3. Risk cost. An attacker would have to get a hash capacity size larger than the current network hash rate and still risk that he fails. The risk of being left with an enormous amount of used hardware.
  4. The double spend must be collectible in some other value asset than bitcoin, that is not reversible, at at short time otherwise you may  cannot double spend. It is hard to collect your double spend from two exchanges as it takes days to get national currency and the bank may charge back the transaction when one of the double spent is retracted by the bitcoin network.
=&gt; In all to build up an 51% hash rate network is a very lossy undertaking at this time, 13-14 Thash, mostly due to 1 and 2 above. Add the risk of 3 and outcome risk of 4. It is truly a costly project to be an attacker at this point (assuming basic crypto math/implementaions still work)
- Volatility is very high now - correct. The main reason is there is no generally held theory of the value of bitcoin utility. The number of agents "voting" on bitcoin value is a million times or more less than for other currencies so the vote will swing a lot. This is expected. Spread sizes are not only dependent on volatility. Spreads are much more determined by liquidity and exchange rules.
@_date: 2011-09-21 06:09:27
You fail to get it: For existing miners capital cost is sunk cost, hence to continue they should exclude capital costs. Econ 101.
@_date: 2011-10-31 15:48:34
You do not get it. Contracts is a lot more than you think. But, never mind explaining them for the world now as it is not ready for it. Crypto contracts is only for people that understand the math. The rest should not care now as you will just fail to use it anyway. False belief of safety is worse than knowing you are unsafe.
@_date: 2011-09-21 10:37:07
No. Nodes will vote (punish) out nodes that do not transmit/or include valid transactions they heard about. This have been discussed. Not implemented but this will be needed in the future to make certain self interest strategies uneconomical. It is not clear how it would play out if 51% nodes ignored new or some transactsion. Possible a forked where the "good" nodes will be dominant even if they are &lt; 50%
@_date: 2011-09-21 06:07:16
Probably worthless discussing to you. You are just ignoring any proof of failure in your propositions (as done elsewhere...) 
e.g. 
* I will just repeat: bitcoin is as fast as VISA or faster if you indentify yourself under contract law. Paypal et al. a single corp. that will decide who you "should" pay. etc just a poop and crap service for us outside US. And these services are very unsafe and divulge too much information.
* I did not talk about high-value large transactions unconditionally, but transactions that double spend under a 51% attack. If you receive a lot of or high value transactions, to increase confidence you can monitor the network (mine yourself etc in multiple parts of the world) and require extra confirmation before you execute a non-chareback payout.
@_date: 2011-09-22 16:00:09
Of course it is not in the block... it can never be in a block! But if a node (in your case 90% of the nodes) node knows of a transaction (since long) and sees a new block with a conflicting transaction, that has suspiciously not been propagated, it is a glaring double spend attack on the network, is it not?
@_date: 2011-09-22 10:00:00
Not to go into every bad conduct and how to suppress it (there may be many hard cases), but in this case there is clear evidence. There is a double spend right in that block. So there is someone doing something wrong.

Donation button is fixed now! Using bitcoin for human and environmental defence is a very good initiative. Don't let Visa and the banking feed on the resistance!

I simply do not believe you are able to roll back all the trades! The bug has has been in the engine much longer than on 12th of April. This video shows problems on earlier dates ( It has generated inconsistent trades randomly for a long time. The bug most probably occurs when you get the trade payment but the order remaining volume is not decreased or decreased too late, so another trade for the same volume can happen - i.e. transactional inconsistency. The real problem is that the bitcoins or EUR are likely to have been withdrawn by users so the bitcoin-24 do not enough have assets left. If the losses are small enough to cover, is  anyone's guess, but I would never believe that.
@_date: 2013-08-21 15:32:39
I do hope they succeed as there remittance market is huge. But, I think chances are very slim. From what has been released before, the people behind are clueless about exchange engine, financial markets, as well as trading mechanics. Also, the newest gorilla problem is regulation. No bitcoin market in US will succeed as things are currently moving towards a completely repressive federal nation.
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:07:17
Warning! It is not safe to believe "new" addresses in Bitcoin-Qt are new. Bitcoin-Qt creates 100 keys that are unused and kept in the key pool. When you select new address, you get one from the pool. It will also exist in old backups unless you create more the 100 new addresses. Not many people get this. The reason for this, is to make your backup work for some time into the future.
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:11:57
TAiS46, you have yet to comment the bug in your trading engine and the corrupted trades generated. Unregarding the account problems you must,
 - Roll-back illegal trades,
 - Report the state of the account records.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:48:53
The corrupt trades are the BIG problem. Lets face the facts. The trading engine were "producing" EUR and BTC out of nothing under heavy load. How long this has been going on will determine the outcome - can the mess be untangled? Now it is clear, this is the result of amateur technical know-how, and you could assume the company has amateur business and legal know-how, as well. We all learnt a lesson. Know your counter-party!
As it looks now, the bug has been present from start. The corruptions may thus have occurred occasionally accumulating over time without being detected. Thus, the EUR and BTC accounts may be inconsistent with real funds. Bitcoin-24 may well be bankrupt at this moment.
If bitcoin-24 had a correct trading record in the database, he could prove to the authorities the the business is legit. And, start a process to recover the bank funds. Now it is a mess as the users accounts are in doubt. The accounts are surely wrong according to latest transaction records before the site closed. We are now, all waiting for a statement about the roll-back of trades. That is the most important issue! That is the REASON the site went down.
I do not say this to stir up a panic. I just want to explain there are many technical people like me that know the severity of this kind bug that results in model inconsistency of the database records corresponding to actual assets. There may, or may not, be enough data to simply roll back the trades.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:49:05
Agreed! Use a language with good support for types. Also, there are thousands of developers that work with this for a living, so you could try to find one of them in your team, so you do not have to retry all the bad designs again.
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:20:43
So you claim this video is made up? If so I am surprised, but it is good news. I would apologize for repeating false information.
"Some trades duplicated" - can you describe the reason or nature of the infamous "bug" then?
What about trades that were reported to happened three, four or five times, was that accurate complaints, and are those also rolled-back?
If the roll-back is completed, very good! I think it would be appropriate to open the site for inspection of transactions and balances. Shut off trading, deposits, and withdraws and let users logon to verify the status. This would allow any inconsistencies to be handled before withdrawals start.
Sincere thanks for the effort to sort this out!

Ripple does not work at all for the remittance market as it requires a way to settle debt outside the system. That would then be the current expensive existing remittance system - so there is no point using Ripple at all.

Simon has problems. 
* It gets very confusing about the rolled-back trades. Which trades were actually rolled back? 
* He did not comment the video from many days back, it is fake according to Simon earlier reddit comment. Is it really?
* Suddenly Simon is not the one rolling back trades but now he refers to "my programmer" , simon does not verify which transactions gets rolled-back! Simon only mentions double trades. He does not acknowledge that he did something wrong. The bug has never been mentioned, or if it was corrected.
* Simon intend to allow withdraws of BTC, and any other currency than EUR. If bitcoin-24 never recovers the EUR account(s) that means bitcoin-24 is bankrupt and it should be closed under British bankruptcy law. Thus, it is probably illegal to prioritize some credit holders over others. He does not even reflect over this. 
* Simon has a language problem. Confusion all over.
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:04:48
Of course they will be reversed. Do you think bitcoin-24 can mint BTC or EUR? All the trades cannot be honored. They were the result of bug.
