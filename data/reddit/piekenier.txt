Only in some countries.

For what it is worth the usual sites where I purchase cryptocurrency were all sold out as well as similar sites in my country, which I never experienced before. Which to me indicates that this ride is far from finished.

Personally I fail to see a reasonable alternative going forward into the future. Automation will create a massive rise in unemployment in the coming decades.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:16:12
I never said Bitcoin was sold out, the sites where I purchase them were.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:55:01
Those aren't exchanges, I'm buying directly from these companies. Reason I choose to to it that way is because it is extremely fast, often having the funds on my wallet within minutes as opposed to first transfering funds to an exchange and waiting on the banks to complete that transaction.

It is either that or a dystopian society ran by multinationals and technocrats. Eventually, at least.

Basicly you don't pay for the gain of value, rather you pay a certain percentage on the amount of value you own. With some things subtracted like debt and some preset amounts.
Basicly its good if you are actively investing and making good gains, but awefull for you if you are very conservative and just focussing on keeping your cash on bank accounts.

And here we thought Elon Musk would bring us to Mars, it was Bitcoin all along!

Essentially. But you would still need to rely on software to decode it, hence adding a risk to the process. A hardware wallet will always need a physical authorisation to acces your funds which results in less risks. At least that is what I think, maybe some paper wallet experts can add their experiences.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:56:44
I've seen the video where they tested it but I wonder just how tough it is. Does definately seem safer than the piece of paper though which I assume will fade in time.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:01:08
So essentially it is a deflationairy currency. Holding a lot of it makes you a target for the criminal investors with huge amounts invested though. Especially if its publicly known that you own a lot of coins which can't be retrieved if something happens to you.

That is the thing, a global crisis would probably be good for Bitcoin. Both in spreading its use and in increasing its value. Just look at countries with hyperinflation for example, they are already flooding towards Bitcoin for a stable alternative.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:29:25
Storage of value is its usage. Essentially acting like digital gold.

Mining isn't that efficient anymore right? Or do you mean cloud mining?
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:34:52
Nothing. Entire concept of daytrading is that one person gains and the other loses. Point of hodling is gaining on the long term increase in value.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:40:00
Stock and bond ETF's, like normal investors do which aren't speculating on cryptocurrency. Dividends could be seen as an extremely generous basic income at that point.

The plot of Altered Carbon?
@_date: 2018-03-04 12:50:45
The point I'm making is that a risk-averse way of investing/speculating would be to hold for a long-term period based on steady purchases without panicking over drops in value which are short-term.
Basicly the same as you would do if you were to invest in stocks through a fund. Odds of beating the market are always low, but surfing the market upwards isn't nearly as hard.

You can't predict the dips, best is just to keep a standard system not influenced by human emotion. Dollar Cost Averaging should work fine for him.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:34:05
I thought it was shot down? Or has there been recent development on a BTC/Crypto ETF?
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:24:11
Sell the shit, hodl the BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:33:33
Because I use CoinBase to buy since Kraken is taking ages to verify my account and CoinBase is still somewhat cheaper than many others.
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:28:21
I'm aware of alternatives, in fact I've been considering the Ledger Nano S. However the advantage of the Trezor being that its older and more tested and the source code also having been scoured for any mallware so I presume its the most save kind of Hardware Wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:39:31
According to Coinbase it is about a ~58% increase.

It can be usefull if you intend to index the cryptocurrency market.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:49:08
Personally I've decided to go 65% Bitcoin, 30% Ethereum and 5% Litecoin. Based on market cap and traded volume. Basicly you can't really predict which coin will rise without inside information however if you believe the Cryptocurrency market as a whole will rise then it makes sense to diversify in many different coins. Once I have some more funds I'll probably diversify in some more different coins.
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:50:45
Actually if Bitcoin continues to rise so exponentially than such a knife could even be worth quite some if you can proof you got it with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:03:49
Use an exchange, such as Kraken.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:44:20
It could be depending on your indexing strategy, for example if Bitcoin is 95% you could make that the percentage of your Cryptocurrency assets allocated to Bitcoin. Or you could work with equal shares based on a certain size tresshold. Depends really.

They are are sold out, still waiting for them to become available again.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:24:06
Same, when Coinbase stops screwing up. Really glad I placed an order for a hardware wallet, Coinbase is down several times each day, its getting extremely frustating. 
Not sure either why people seem to intend on selling, just hold and buy a set amount each month while buying extra when it drops. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:01:30
Well thanks for your reply, have been doing some more digging at it seems the Ledger Nano S will do. I've just ordered one, sadly I'll still have to wait for the factory to finish production. 
How does Ledger feel about supporting new Altcoins? Monero for example seems rather interesting but doesn't appear on the Ledger app list.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:11:24
Currently it is about €1670 and the trend is [still downwards]( I feel bad for buying at the growth a week ago however this does provide an oppertunity to buy some more Bitcoin at a discount. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:39:37
Cryptowatch. Kraken has made a deal with them to integrate their platform into the Kraken exchange, it is pretty nice.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:22:24
The safest kind of storage is through specialised hardware. Such as a Trezor or a Ledger. Personally I'm waiting for my Ledger Nano S to arrive so I can hold my funds on the device.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:16:57
You can send them to another wallet addres, which requires you to create a new one. I'd suggest a hardware wallet to keep them safe. Trezor or Ledger Nano S are fine.
