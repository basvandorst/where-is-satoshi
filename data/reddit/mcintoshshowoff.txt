If the US doesn't take part, forget about widespread adoption.

If the SEC decides to regulate crypto, there's not a damn thing any of you can do about it, just so you know.

This is not a reality for most people. 


This is fucking stupid advice. a mortgage is a great investment. paying cash for a home is not. answer this: who comes out better after 30 years? the guy who pays $500k cash for a house or the one who puts down $100k and invests the other $400k in equities or... more real estate? leverage is a powerful thing. 


what planet are you living on? this is not something the majority of people can pull off. finding a group of people who are disciplined enough to do this is a serious challenge, that's why it doesn't happen.




Bitcoin was never designed to be an investment. It represents nothing. It doesn't have an army backing it. It is code. It is nothing. This is terrible advice is so many different ways. 
Invest in real estate. It is tangible. You can touch it, feel it, improve it, it will always a utility as long as people need a place to live. the bitcoin party is over. it is a flawed medium of exchange. that's why it's worth 25% of what it was at its high. it is shitty at its intended purpose.

how so?

My response is clearly a response to your terrible advice in regards to not utilizing a mortgage or credit. Don't try to spin this, that's why I quoted what I was responding to. 


Aiming to do something that is unattainable for most people is bad advice. Accomplishing the same thing (affording something you otherwise couldn't) via a mortgage is much more sound advice.

people are irrational, the post above should illustrate that fact. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:00:03
sick burn bruh. why would I round when I can give you the exact number? It's a calculation. there's no mystery or need to round. On this theoretical 20 year mortgage, you are making 240 of the exact same payment, the interest paid from that is not an abstract number. It is determined the moment you commit to that schedule of payments.

Certainly seems like you might be riding the short bus yourself. 


No it's not. Ever heard of something called an amortization schedule? No of course not, because you're an idiot. For a $100k loan at 5%, the interest paid after 20 years is $58,389.38.

dollar cost averaging is not a good way to justify losing money. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:57:26
people like you are the reason why the SEC was created. too dumb to make your own decisions, so the government will have to step in to protect you from yourself.

that might be your definition, but I would say not attempting to catch the falling knife applies to any sum of money, especially when that sum of money is a large portion of your cash on hand. crpto is not a good investment, that is why the price is falling. it sucks at its intended purpose. 
Dollar cost averaging really doesn't apply here and frankly anything crypto isn't that volatile, it's on a pretty clear downward trajectory because it sucks. the tech is important, but the current players aren't going to survive in their current forms. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:47:13
don't try.

THEY don't actually. that's why the price keeps going down.

bullshit. everyone now knows about bitcoin now, the only suckers left are the ones still holding. any sane person does not want a "currency" that has been shown to lose 80%+ in a year, regardless of the previous pumping up. that is not going to change. 
you all got played by people who are smarter than you, that manipulated a completely unregulated market. We're talking people who work for big banks and investment firms who can't typically trade due to conflicts of interest, but are extremely skilled at identifying bubbles and foolish trading activities. they're the ones who made the money. them and the early adopters who served you the kool-aid that you all are still drinking. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:58:22
What fundamentals? 
People in large numbers are never going to use bitcoin because it simply sucks at its intended purpose.
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:28:02
exactly, and one could even argue it's not even an asset. certainly doesn't behave like one. 
the problem with people here is that most who remain don't grasp the basics of investments. 90% of the posts I see here are complete garbage. the 1920s ignorance of the alive and well here.

good investments don't crater &gt;80% in a year. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:21:51


If you understood the problems with bitcoin and actually grasped what they mean going forward, I doubt you'd have made your purchase. This is a classic case of trying to catch a falling knife. There has been absolutely no evidence to be seen that the current price is the bottom.


Understanding how it works doesn't make it a "good investment".

a good company should be able to reinvest and have a higher ROI than a dividend paying investment.

welcome to r/bitcoin. the only people left here are morons
