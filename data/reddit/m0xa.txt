I'm still waiting for a $5 BTC transfer from my wallet to my friend's wallet to go through - it's been 5 weeks now! Maybe it will be soon...

Why is it a bad idea to use BTC to buy alt coins?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:07:27
Yes, I’m using breadwallet. I sent them an email and they just said to wait. Actually I’ve just checked and the transaction shows as rejected which is disappointing. When I made the transfer the fees were very low ($0.50) so I wonder if these transactions are now a super low priority for miners.

I sent a small bitcoin payment over 10 days ago - it’s still showing as only 20% complete in my wallet.

Sounds legit

What is a good exchange at the moment to buy alt coins?  GDAX ? Bittrex?

I use BTC Markets.
Edit: I should say that it is based in Australia.

That's weird, I used my NAB card to pay for breakfast about an hour ago and it worked fine...

Welcome to Australia! Watch out for all the wildlife

It certainly looks like its due to drop according to the trend of the graph. I'm about to invest after waiting a few days for my deposit to make its way to an exchange.  I'll be watching the market closely over the next day or so.

Thanks.  It's still processing - taking about 70 mins so far. My fee was 10.694 sat/B.

How long is it taking for transactions to be confirmed right now?  
Last time I sent a transaction it took 6 weeks to be confirmed! (last year with a very low fee)

I thought it meant ‘possibly shit advice’

I have a noob question. Is there a recommended minimum amount of BTC to purchase on an exchange in order to avoid paying too many transaction fees?
I ask as I have made my first $100 purchase of BTC and approx $4 of that has been charged in fees by the time it arrives in my wallet.

I'm currently storing a small amount of BTC on breadwallet for iOS.  Would Electrum be a better option?  I want to invest more over the next few weeks and will look to buy a hardware wallet over the longer term for more secure storage.

I'm actually using BTC Markets &amp; buying in AUD.  Transaction fee was AUD 0.85c to buy BTC, then there was a BTC 0.005 charge to withdraw it to a wallet.
