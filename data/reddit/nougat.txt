Except that if the retirement fund is in a 401K or IRA, you can't withdraw until retirement age without paying taxes (except on a traditional IRA) *and* a hefty penalty. Professor's concern is not unwarranted.

That's super cool! Excellent to know!

I can kind of see that, because the value of gold bar/bullion would be just the value of the material, where a coin might have an additional numismatic value. Even if the coin doesn't, it could still be classed as a "numismatic" property as opposed to a "purely material" property (I made up those categories).

Best thing to do is rebalance 401K and IRA investments into index funds. Can you supplement that with crypto? Sure. I'm doing it, as a matter of fact, and I hope I haven't started too late.
But I feel comfortable doing it because I understand the technology and have been watching from the sidelines for a long time. I am confident that there's a necessary place in the world's economies for crypto, and that we're nowhere near the peak value.
It's that comfort and confidence that enables me to start diverting funds to crypto that I would otherwise put into a 401K. For people who are older than I am (doesn't have to be by much, honestly), closer to retirement, without the same understanding and confidence - crypto is not a risk they would be comfortable with.

And the value of fiat currencies is based on people's faith and trust in the future stability of the nation/economy/citizenry that backs it - not future tax revenue.

I read Sunday morning that Visa reversed that and said it *was* Visa, and had nothing to do with Coinbase.

The things which must be on a check to make it a legal check are very few.  You can write it on a napkin with a crayon.
