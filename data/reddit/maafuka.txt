Most of the Bitcoin community doesn't even understand Bitcoin

From the article:


I think this part is also interesting:


Maybe it's just me, but this doesn't sound like something the creator of Bitcoin would say.

No one said it was a coincidence. If he is Satoshi like he claims, then he would be in possession of a large amount of Bitcoins. I don't think it's ridiculous to suspect that he hasn't declared his assets with the ATO.

even if it is staying 99sat that means it's dropping at the same rate as bitcoin... 
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:21:37
Sorry yes, that's what I meant
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:01:18
Yes let's give everyone the ability to delete posts, great idea!

This looks great, definitely going to move some coins over to play around with.
Any plans to offer other coins in the future?

It's a good way to turn 1 bitcoin into 10 that's for sure.

uh, read his post again. no one is claiming microsoft came up with the tablet.

I've heard this point made so many times and it couldn't be further from the truth. If you compare the frontpage of with you'll see that the doge community is much more concerned about the value of the coin. All the time people screaming "TO THE MOON" and "Time to buy doge while it's low". The community is full of false optimism and aggressiveness towards other cryptocurrencies. As someone passionate about cryptocurrencies I find it embarrassing.

The amount of downvotes this is receiving is pretty unjustified

There's no more effort involved in paying your workers less frequently though.

Stupid slogan that effectively means nothing.

nice one!

To be certain either way silly. 
In 2015 when the price was ~$400, people would've had the same reaction to someone saying "in 2 years Bitcoin will be over $10k (2500% increase)". He's suggesting a price increase half of that.
It's not that outrageous of a prediction, even though lots of people would be surprised by it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:16:00
When Bitcoin value drops, apparently the price is irrelevant.
When Bitcoin value rises, the price is everything.


How is this different to the times Bitcoin has risen by larger amounts over longer periods of time?

If there are no fees but the prices are inflated, then I think you've found your fees.

Sounds like a fake story, but I haven't even looked at the images because your website requires people to run some random javascript just to view the images. Really bad design.

Honestly? It's got errors (most likely a non-native English speaker) but it's pretty clear what he's saying
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:18:13
I think the answer is in the image

If you've always wanted to do it, and you're willing to do it just for fun, then why is the pay a turnoff? You could just work through the day to avoid drunk people.
