I'm going to post a followup with the results here and at the major Bitcointalk forum. So far I've had about 40 responses.

Sorry this took so long, I had to manually convert all of the data into USD. AFAIK, other than the study on SilkRoad last year this is the only attempt to estimate the size of trade for actual stuff with Bitcoin. 
You can see a summary of most survey statistics [here]( 
Main points:
* Half of Bitcoin users are American
* 97% of Bitcoin users are male
* Most are working or in school
* Over half have completed at least a Bachelors
* The average user who bought anything with Bitcoin has spent $2,180
* Drugs/contraband are not the most popular good purchased with Bitcoin!
* Bitcoin users have become less worried about anonimity over the last year
* Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin users still have a very, very positive outlook on price.

I know that there is a selection bias in these numbers. But there is just no way that these biases would under represent the size of Bitcoin by a factor of 40.

For starters 300 x 1 day = 300 days or nearly a year. 
Secondly, the $300,000 estimate is based on the number of active accounts that the FBI captured, not Christin's numbers. And it is an extremely high volume for an individual drug dealer. Most drug dealers aren't exactly living the high life. The fact the average Silk Road seller was active for three months doesn't really matter for this calculation.
Third, no one with an iota of intelligence ships hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of of drugs *through the mail*. That would draw the heat eventually. Broken up into thousands of packages, the whole operation would look incredibly suspicious. It's a risky business. In fact, the same day DPR was caught, [authorities started busting down the doors of several of major Silk Road drug dealers]( Some of these absolute top guys might have been passing $300,000 in volume. However, the distribution is probably a few big time dealers, and a lot of petty dealers. 
The whole setup of selling narcotics *by mail* through Silk Road really limits the potential size of the business, because it would be nearly impossible to hide activity from authorities - way harder than selling on the street - as supported by the recent crackdown.

So, I took the results of the survey I did and applied some Macroeconomics 101. 
I think the rationally supported price for Bitcoin is closer to $16 to $30 rather than the absurd level it's at now.

In this case, both of these biases cause my estimate to be too high not too low.

This is true, but at the current price level it is completely disconnected form reality. 
The trade in Bitcoin would have to eclipse well over a billion dollars U.S. to justify the current exchange rate. There is just no evidence of that happening anytime soon. 
Seriously, look at the demographics from previous surveys. A bunch of 20something year old computer-adept males doesn't make a billion dollar market.
The Bitcoin market, although Bitcoin transaction fees are minimal, still has huge high transaction fees in converting from $U.S.

Even if Bitcoin sellers went private, if Bitcoin users still reported their spending without too much bias, my estimate should be fine. 
The FBI reported 3,877 active sellers on Silk Road. Many stores come and go within 3 months.
For over $1 billion in revenue to make sense, the average revenue per store would have to be pushing $300,000. It just doesn't make any sense.

I would like to thank those who took the Bitcoin survey. Without your participation in the survey, the FBI would have gotten away with ludicrously, overvaluing the size of Silk Road in an attempt to *possibly* make DPR look much worse than he really is.
