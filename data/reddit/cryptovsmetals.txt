When people, usually those who are new and interested in Crypto Investment. One of their Typical questions is... 
When should i start investing? 
I usually say this in return...
Last year, yesterday and now.
This is a global wealth transfer, and everyday you wait results in more lost potential.
Over the next few years, people like will be wondering the same question from all over the planet. They won’t have as much first mover potential as you do today.
What's your response to those who ask "When to start in Crypto"?

What's your personal Advice on HODLing?
Keep Calm and don’t panic Panic driven decisions must never determine your actions when it comes to cryptocurrency trading. 
Markets are very volatile and fear or panic-based decisions can be the difference between a wrong or right trade.

What if the monarch were luciferian? I don’t think a deranged monarch does what some of these individuals have done to humanity justice. They are evil.

The coins are immersed in clouds of FUD.  This is a representation of what has been going on in the markets. If you see part 2 of this series ( you will see that the coins were ascending after tossing the dollar in its grave. This goes back to the question of who prints the fiat currency and who are the people in power in today’s society. Many are Luciferian and have many puppets that they use to manipulate markets, governments, and people. This is part 3 in the series where they are pushing the Crypto markets down by having their puppets manipulate media and creating massive sell order (MT GOX Trustee) this creates FUD and now we are in limbo in the Crypto markets as the institutions are continuing to load up their bags.

Thanks!! Which one of this series is your favorite so far?

Not a satanist. This is a comic that is representative of my perspective of what is going on in the Crypto markets. There are many powerful people in positions that manipulate the masses and many of them are luciferian. 
I know that there has been market manipulation in the Crypto space and this is what I’m expressing through the art.

That’s a great direction this can lead to! I’ll save this for reference! We are finishing up PT4 so I’ll hopefully have it posted by this week. :)
