Wow that's fucking stupid.

Fucked up, but perfectly legal.

This is a great thread.  And it reminds me of what a good subreddit should look like.  Just wanted to say that.

Well, considering my lifestyle, no.  Groceries end up in the wastebin due to my second job being extremely erratic.  I have no choice but to eat out to save money.  And that means eating crap food like mcvalue menu shit.  Also, no supermarkets within walking unless you do a 20 minutes minimum round trip, so if there's a line at the cash, I don't have time to eat.
When you're poor and overworked, eating healthy takes a back seat to "eating".

Yeah, I've tried that.  Veggies go bad too fast, and leftovers end up uneaten when I try to cook a big meal.  I live right near a market, so when I can, I will cook at home on my day off, buying only what I need for the meal at hand.  But that ends up happening rarely.
Eating out does suck, but in the right place it's okay.  I have a nearby lebanese joint that does chicken shwarmas for $3 a pop, a great taco place with $5 filling tacos that have a reputation as the best in the city, and a chinese food that has a 4 item special for $6 if I can make it there before they close at 8.  Near my work though... Tim Hortons and McDicks, or overpriced restaurants.

Where I work, I have 2 options after 6pm and on weekends during my 30 minute lunch break.  Tim Hortons and McDonalds.  Mind you, I work in downtown Toronto, not in the middle of fucking nowhere, so to not have any options for healthy eating without walking 20 minutes, is pretty fucked up.

No, actually...
I figured the bitcoin community would be a little miffed, but the outpouring of support is genuinely nice to see.  The humble attitude, it'd be nice to see a bit more of that across the other subs.
