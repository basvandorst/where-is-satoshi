did people actually believe that and consider it when depositing on mt.gox? That seems really hard to believe. Wouldn't a much simpler explanation be that people trusted mt.gox and were swindled? That most people were quite uninformed with respect to the rather complex operation that trading in BTC is at the moment (when considering all the risks)?

the ones that make the most money for their creators will be from Wall Street, though.

Which invisible rules did mtgox have?

Nah, a small fraction of people would be more careful but most wouldn't have the time.

Well now that I stole all this money I'll just pay off the fraud companies... Like who would oppose me? The people who I just stole the money from and who now can't pay the fraud and dispute resolutions companies? The incentives are skewed. The fraud/dispute resolutions companies would lead much easier lives getting a "tax" from thieves like me than doing all this work to recover money for a fraction of what they would receive if they just lookthe other way and aaccept the payment from me. It is essentially zero risk one way and lots of risk the other way.

Why? I mean, in a truly free market, you can invent tons of ways to rob others blind without them figuring out until after they've been robbed. I could collude with marketplace owners to prop up their marketplace giving it the air of legitimacy and solvency for as long as possible so that the average investor buys in and then, poof, the money's gone. it could be set up in a way such that it would take a long time to notice/figure out the scheme, time that average investors wouldn't have. 
In a truly free market without regulation, imagination is the limit. You're not burdened by regulations so why not concoct all kinds of schemes to trick others to give their money to you and then abscond with said money? The anonymity of the internet just makes it easier.

It will be strengthened until the next time. then it will be strengthened again. We must get more buy-in for our ultra-secure BTC exchanges.
