I think this makes sense but doesn’t apply to all coins. Nearly all of my losses are from alts that we’re hyped up, and I doubt many of them will live to rise to the levels they were hyped up before...

I’m sitting at an overall loss of 78% on my portfolio. If you’re truly over 90% down then I feel your pain, but to a lesser degree. I’ve made some huge mistakes :(

This. I may have a false sense of security but in order to get to the alts, for the most part the four coins offered on coinbase are the gateway. The alts on all the various exchanges feels like the wild Wild West, and coinbase is the safe home grounds.

Thanks man. I thought he got poisoned or something - that would have been a crazy development.
What is outline.com? I gotta look into that.

Damn I don’t have a subscription so I can’t read it. Googled this and only WSJ reporting if, 25 mins ago.

Tried again, failed. Maybe it’s because I’m trying on my phone?

I ordered bitcoin socks and a green trading candle tie. Can’t wait to receive them.
