isn't bitcoin not suited for everyday transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:35:59
if everyone just buy btc waiting the right moment to sell then bitcoin is not a good investment in my opinion, mining kinda help spreading the coin so it create the key added value to me (spread the "idea" of it more than use it as a way to make "old" dollars). I read geneis cloud mining is not a scam, was the article wrong or outdated?

I don't understand how you can opt out with a coin that is not suited for everyday transactions... people keep telling me that bitcoin is gold 2.0 but meh...

But the fees make me wonder if btc can really be used as everyday transaction money, with fees to be paid at the parking lot etc. Not gonna invest in btc if people is buying it just because it is gaining value

it has probably been asked a milion times, but what's with transaction fees? the bank that has my money makes me pay nothing for visa use, I can get money on ATMs from all banks in Europe with no fees, make payments from one bank to another again no fees, the entire bank account (with home banking etc) costs 0 if you have less than 5k€, then the government tax is applied. why should I use bitcoin if I need to pay a fee for every transaction?

I see, so why should we buy it? what makes it special beyond being the most famous crypto?

Soo I'm new and gathering info here and there, I'd like to jump in but I'm not sure if I should buy currency or invest in a mining pool cloud maybe, what would you guys do with a budget of 10k €?
