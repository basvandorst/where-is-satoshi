Works fine, I like it! It is worth installing Chrome for. No problems so far, but I've only done small transactions.

I agree - this is really amazing and will be excellent for travel to Thailand.  


Judging by the process they've got outlined on the website, probably just a daily withdrawal limit.

The inevitable failure point of cartels - someone always cheats. Looks like the first winner is Italy!

Post it and let's take a look.

[These guys]( seem to have a functional system - you might reach out to them and find out what hardware they are using.   


I agree, complete solutions are lacking and it is wasteful to have parallel POS solutions.

Nobody needs a bank account now.

I'm not sure that's the case. BitInstant was different in that Charlie Shrem clearly broke the (visible, known) rules. 
This is a totally different situation. This is as if you sell bicycles for a living, and when someone buys a bicycle from you, you watch them in perpetuity. If they use that bicycle to egg a neighbors house at some point, you refuse to ever do business with them again. 
Rational actors just don't behave that way - a third party is forcing their hand, I'd bet.

It's possible CB has received an NSL and/or is involved in something like Operation Chokepoint. This type of behavior is certainly not good for business, and any rational market actor would not behave this way. 
Best solution for CB might be to cease US operations and move to...Italy.

Account still works, no fucks given. Just send to electrum then to DW.
EDIT: CB user since they opened up shop, so maybe I have more cred than you peasants.

Meh. I'll just use bitquick.co then.

The timeline shows a Beta launch of 2015. What does that mean? It looks like you have to compile it from source right now in order to try it.

Works fine for me so far, I've only used it for small transactions but I like it.

It means that all Bitcoin exchanges will be located in Italy and Italy's GDP will go through the roof in a decade or two.

That's a rational explanation. I suppose all we know for sure is that they are working closely and in secret with government agents - whether they're doing that voluntarily or not is not really of any consequence.

Insightful post, I agree.
