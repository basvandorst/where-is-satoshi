I can possibly get it back for you, if you provide me some details on what you remember ... u'd need to contact me, so I can tell you how much time it would take based on the hash power I have and from what you remember, how much entropy remains.  depends on how many words you remember even if out of order.

ok I opened a ticket, hopefully they can send a new one before  receiving the old one back.   Maybe i can send a video of the freezing.  just tried again and this time froze on "confirm pin"  cant even change the first digit off of the 5.   So Electrum is that the bitkey solution?  I suppose I could jsut write my own code to generate a bip39 address in a cold environment and then send coind to that address.   Then to get the coins out,  generate a a signed transaction on the cold system, then on a separate hot computer broadcast the JSON transaction - right?

the corelation betgwenn halving and inflation is true - HOWEVER - consider that inflation "9coin cretion)  is akin to bitcoin selling and just small amounts of selling create a price drop,  once that selling stops - ie once the coins are no longer made,  the price goes up fast.  So losing just 1% inflation will creat a string price rise.  That is becasue markets are not too fluid on exchanges - so suddenly the seemingly constant selling of even 1% will stop when halving occurs, each time.  But yes the effect is arguable when halving goes down to .5% and .25%. and .12% ....

thanks, problem is I waited a month of rthis one and need one ASAP for August 1st deadline.  Can you suggest any compatible "offline" wallet but that I still must "download" as software that i can "run" on a cold machine not connected to the Internet so i can at least generate the btc public address list i can "send" a coin to now?
