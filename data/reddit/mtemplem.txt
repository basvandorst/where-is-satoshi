That's beyond awesome. I'm still waiting to join in, but what you're doing--giving people a use case to attach themselves to bitcoin--is so much more valuable than anything else you could do to introduce people to the community.
I keep hearing tech experts say that bitcoin has proven it is a viable platform, now it's just waiting for its killer app.  in my book people like you are that killer app!

You'd be suprised. Best kept secret: most of the charts you see for operating margin for bitcoin mining are using woefully inaccurate assumptions in their calculations. Mining isn't unprofitable now, but it will become breakeven very soon (probably by the end of the year) as contract mining becomes pervasive. 
There was a massive shift in mining around the beginning of the year when ASIC chips came out specifically engineered to run the bitcoin mining algorithm. This dropped the price of mining power, measured in gigahash-per-second (Gh/s) down from about $1250 per Gigahash to $25-$50 per Gigahash (depending when you bought a miner). That's a huuuuge difference, and unfortunately most of those operating margin charts still use $1,000 per Gigahash in their baseline calculations.
Also, the electricity consumption required for a given miner has remained the same, but in terms of electricity cost per unit of computing power (the aforementioned almighty gigahash-per-second), you see a simlarly huge drop in terms of scale.

IMHO we need to push at least one block size increase through, if only to strike it off the list of reasonable arguments from bitcoin's detractors out there. 
If not, btc will top out as solely the de facto store of value commodity, and the other players (fiat, cash, maybe some altcoins) will split up the remaining transactional space.
