Rather than mentioning 'doubling' in these kinds of conversations, I like to mention all the powers of ten it went through.. if it can go from $1, $10, $100, $1000 to $10,000.... the next 'points' of interest in my eternally optomistic mind are $100k and $1m, and neither of those are unrealistic to me.

My understanding is that derived value is value that comes from somewhere, e.g. A car's value is derived from its usefulness.
Intrinsic value is value that doesn't come from anything else; it just 'magically exists'... it's a concept that some humans have come up with because ...damn, I can't find the words to explain why anyone decided to come up with such nonsense.

How much is a loaf of bread worth?
Despite bread/money not changing hands every nanosecond, we humans still know the approximate value, from past experience (i.e. past transactions).
I wonder if can cite an actual past transaction at ~15-17 BTC to base our estimates on.

FWIW... after the all-time-high got to about $1200, the low point during the down cycle after that was about $250.
If things go similarly from here, after this boom we might still see it at $2500 during the 'low' point over the next couple of years.

I never claimed that anybody could.
But once those bitcoins *were* lost (taken), that transfer could only happen once, assuming the new transaction places the coins into some type of 'upgraded' key that *can't* be taken by anyone.
Once every single old private key had been relieved of its funds, the new, stonger keys would gradually disperse funds around and get back to being a normal market again.

simplest way:
1. send your btc to a new address
2. using your old private keys which now have 0 bitcoins in them, import those private keys into a 'BCH' wallet (I don't know of one off the top of my head but that search shouldn't be too difficult)
3. using that wallet, send BCH to somewhere to sell them for bitcoins.
Be careful not to import private keys (into a BCH wallet) that contain bitcoins, you don't want to put them at risk.

Why not? Why shouldn't the legal owner of an asset get to decide how much money has to be given in compensation for transferring ownership of that asset to someone else?
The same question applies for services - why should a person or entity be forced to provide a service at a price lower than they feel like providing it for?
Nobody on either side of the fence should be forced into a trade. That entails being forced to give up an asset which you legally own (theft), or provide a service which you don't want to provide (slavery).

@_date: 2017-11-02 11:39:26
Well, I very much suspect this method is outdated now, what with all the fancy new 'programmable money' things that Bitcoin can do these days, but here's how someone *might* do it:
1. On an *online* computer, use a service like `random.org` to generate a small random-char string, about 6 to 8 characters long, e.g. `jw49fw4d` *without reading it!* Let's call this `$randchars`
2. Download a script such as the one at `bitaddress.org`.
3. Transfer that script, and `$randchars` to a separate *offline* computer (using something like a USB drive)
4. On your offline computer, create yourself a long, secure passphrase. e.g. `incorrect donkey power glue` Let's call this `$passphrase` - and back it up somewhere (offline) so you never lose this part!
5. Still on your offline computer, use the 'brainwallet' tab of the bitaddress script to create a bitcoin address/privkey pair from `$passphrase` added to `$randchars`. e.g. if your passphrase was derp and your randchars was 69, then you'd be making a brainwallet from derp69.
6. Transfer your entire life savings into the bitcoin address you just generated.
7. Back on your online computer, use a service such as `futureme.org` to email `$randchars` to yourself at some far off date in the future.
8. Delete all trace of `$randchars` from your own computers.
Some important points:
1. Back up, back up, back up, the `$passphrase` part should never be lost! But don't put that part anywhere near the internet.
2. If you can manage to do the entire process without *actually reading or seeing* `$randchars` so much the better, because you won't have to rely on will power to not access your coins - you shouldn't even know these chars. However, if you're copying/pasting with your eyes half closed, you have to be doubly triply sure that the bitcoin address you generated was definitely from `$passphrase$randchars` and not `$passphrase[some other random crap in your clipboard|null]`
3. The length and chars in `$randchars` is very important. You're trying to aim to make this part bruteforceable (plan B scenario where `futureme.org` fails somehow), but not *easily* bruteforceable (you don't want to be tempted to try to access your coins before the vesting date you chose). I think 8 alphabet chars is good, because it's about 200 billion combinations. So you can't just casually get to it, but the number is low enough that you won't permanently lose your money in a brute-force scenario.
4. Make sure whatever email address you give to `futureme.org` is one that you'll be able to access on the vesting date. I recommend having your own domain for this purpose, as you never know what policies hotmail/gmail/latesthipstermail will cause your account closure.
5. You'll see from this process that because you choose a very secure `$passphrase` and never shared that with anyone, you're the only one that can actually brute-force the brain wallet if it comes to that. So you don't need to worry about futureme staff or any intermediaries intercepting $randchars. The worst they could do is make you access your coins early.
Edit: Aaaaactually, if you're going to go and actually set this up, there's one more thing that I'd recommend doing...
1. When you create your secure passphrase, also create a secondary one, completely different e.g.   `secondary going factory transport`   ...`$otherphrase`
2. Generate a secondary bitcoin address by using `$otherphrase$randchars`  &lt;-- the exact same `$randchars` as you used for your first term deposit address.
3. Save that bitcoin address somewhere, but don't transfer any coins to it (yet).
The reason for doing this is so that in a bruteforce scenario, you can ask other people to help find `$randchars` without exposing your life savings. e.g. You publish `$otherphrase` and the secondary bitcoin address, and publish the rules you used to create $randchars (i.e. how long, allowed characters, etc).
Optionally, you could transfer a small 'reward' amount into the secondary bitcoin address. If some 3rd party can generate the secondary address/priv key using `$otherphrase$randchars`, then they can tell you what `$randchars` is and you can access all your coins (using `$passphrase$randchars`).

Dear 5-year-olds: It's making a change to something in a way that makes it not work properly with the old way.
A soft fork on the other hand, is changing something in a way that the new way and old way can work together.
In bitcoin, a hardfork changes the network rules in such a way that people who don't upgrade their software can't participate (basically, it forces the new rules on everyone).
A softfork brings new rules, but doesn't invalidate the old ones, so people can continue using older client versions, etc. Improvements without being disruptive.
To put it another way, imagine the bitcoin network had 3 rules:
* You can do A
* You can do B
* You can do C
A softfork might say:
* You can do A
* You can do B
* You can do C
* You can do D
A hardfork might say:
* You can do A
* You can do C
* You can do D
* You can do E
(Notice that B has been disallowed)
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:14:36
It would seem then, that the only change to the way my example described it, would be to list rules covering things you *can't* do:
If the network says:
* You can't do A
* You can't do B
* You can't do C
A softfork might say:
* You can't do A
* You can't do B
* You can't do C
* You can't do D
A hardfork might say:
* You can't do A
* You can't do C
* You can't do D
* You can't do E
(Doing 'B' is now allowed, which breaks older clients' validation)

Unfortunately though, the only built-in backup function of that particular wallet just expects you to be importing the backup into the same software - the private keys aren't that easily accessible.

I just think 'dictate' it's an unnecessarily loaded choice of word. Apple 'dictates' what price you have to pay for an iPhone. It's called setting a price and it's a normal everyday process in every single company. At least, it should be, if governments aren't immorally interfering with the market.

So what? How is that different from supermarkets 'controlling' what milk brands you can buy? We don't need protection from ISPs any more than we need protection from any other enterprise that we're free to do (optional) business with.

I didn't even suggest it would be good for consumers.
It would be good for consumers if the government forced ISPs  to offer high speed internet for $0.48 per year, but that doesn't make such a proposition moral, when those ISPs are private companies.

What makes you hope that? Is theft mitigation not one of bitcoin's most revolutionary benefits? The ability to have utmost control over one's finances?
Even an obscure, indirect theft like the one most people suffer via inflation of the fiat money supply, will ultimately be non-existent with bitcoin.

Are you implying that if something's 'good for consumers' it's always the right thing to do? No matter how you frame it, if you're asking the government to enforce a transaction where only one party is willing, then it necessarily involves either theft from or slavery of the unwilling party, depending on whether it's a product or a service involved.
Both of those scenarios are morally repugnant.

You're saying money laundering opens the door to criminals. You're the one who has labeled those people. I'm saying many of them wouldn't have that label if money laundering weren't a crime.
Hence: money laundering wouldn't 'open the door' to criminals, because many of them wouldn't be.
If we made it a crime to paint bicycles yellow, would allowing yellow bicycle paint without a license, be 'opening the door to criminals'? Anyone painting a bicycle yellow would be a criminal then.

What always entertains me about statists is that just because a working alternative can't be figured out, that somehow justifies the status quo as ethical.
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:48:44
Partly, yeah. Running a 'money transmitting business' (i.e. buying/selling currency) just shouldn't be illegal, imo. I think ultimately it comes down to 'facilitating a crime' shouldn't be its own crime... but *especially* when that facilitation could easily be accidental/unknown.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:22:06
Let me reword on the assumption that I have no idea what the word 'ethical' means:

I disagree. I personally allow millions of innocent people to die per year, and don't feel even slightly bad for doing that.
Even if someone had a chance to save someone else's life, I don't think it's right to make anyone feel obligated to do so.
Refraining from life-saving is a totally different thing to murder, and shouldn't be punishable at all, in my opinion.

No, he's saying it because people have the ability to block* funds from addresses (and address history) that they don't like. Making some bitcoins sunshine and rainbows (and potentially more 'valuable'), and other bitcoins 'tainted'.
For further research, you might look up the concept of 'taint' in a bitcoin address.
*Sorry, not quite 'block'. You can't stop someone from sending you bitcoins to a publicly-known address. But people receving funds may choose to act (e.g. credit some account, send you a product), or not act, based on whether they think the bitcoins you sent are good enough or if they are too closely tied to what the recipient percieves as bad/immoral transactions.

As a buyer though, I remember becoming 'concerned about the price' when they started getting over $1.80-ish, and told my main seller back then that he'd have to 'do me a good deal' if I'm going to keep buying from him. I was never a miner. I remember winning about 300 BTC too on some little ponzi-style advertising game that someone had set up - it was cool, but not really that big of a deal.
The password is just a randomly-generated one (the opposite of the advice given in XKCD's "correct horse battery staple" comic)
I had a regular ol' wallet.dat from bitcoin-qt, stored in a truecrypt container.
The only place the password existed was in my head. I have since written down various parts that I remember, but it hasn't really helped.

Nobody forced the coinbase founders to do what they're doing. They are grown adults, presumably capable of making their own decisions. So if they're now in bed with US gov, blame-shifting will always be unjustified.

Here's the non-pompous link: 
Edit: Here's the text with an actual readable level of contrast:
BITCOIN CASH AND THE UAHF
On August 1st, a minority miner plans to spin-off or "fork" the bitcoin (BTC) blockchain and create a new altcoin known as "bitcoin cash" or "BCC". We want to take this opportunity to educate our customers and also provide our stance on this potential fork.
To put it in layman's terms, a very small miner (less than 6.5% of total hash power) wants to copy the current bitcoin blockchain (BTC / bitcoin core), and use that data to create a new chain with completely different rules. They plan on calling the currency of this new chain "bitcoin cash", otherwise known as "BCC". Because this new chain also copies the real (current) chain, technically, anyone that owns BTC on August 1st will also own an equal amount of the BCC altcoin. Since the rules of this new chain are incompatible with the current BTC / bitcoin core rules, any transactions or blocks mined on that chain will appear invalid on the real bitcoin core chain.
What's the reasoning for a miner to do this? Well, money, obviously. By creating a new chain, that miner is essentially creating a new cryptocurrency. Since they can change the rules for this new coin however they'd like, they've lowered the difficulty to mine it significantly, making it much easier to mine BCC compared to BTC. What they are hoping for is that the value of BCC stays high enough so that other miners will also be incentivized to mine BCC, in return, removing hashpower from BTC, which will then hopefully lower the difficulty to mine it as well. Ideally for them, other miners would bounce back between BCC and BTC depending on which is more profitable. They've even launched a futures market for people to trade BCC ahead of time, most likely trying to pump the price as much as possible to give other miners an incentive to switch to BCC as soon as it's available. At this time, we (and pretty much everyone else) predict that BCC will most likely fail shortly after launch, since as soon as it's available, users will most likely dump BCC in favor of BTC, which will still remain the majority hashrate chain, and the true bitcoin. However, no one is a 100% certain what the outcome will be.
CoinFlip has no plans whatsoever to support any sort of bitcoin spin-off or altcoin, and BCC provides no exception to this stance. We will continue to support bitcoin core, and as far as bitcoin goes - only sell and buy bitcoin core at our terminals. After August 1st, all bitcoin (BTC / bitcoin core) sold from our terminals will already be split. That means all transactions from our wallets will be invalid on BCC (bitcoin cash) blockchain, and only valid on the majority BTC (bitcoin core) blockchain. Still, as a safety precaution to prevent any issues with customers potentially losing funds, we will be disabling bitcoin sells and buys for a minimum of at least 24 hours on 8/1 until we believe the network has fully stabalized. Until then, our BATMs will operate as normal, and as long as you have access to your private keys, you can split your BTC and BCC after 8/1 if you wish to do so.
If you're wondering how you can split your coins after the potential fork, you can read our guide at  . However, this guide features relatively advanced steps, such as signing and broadcasting a custom raw transaction. CoinFlip is not liable for any lost BCC or BTC as a result from use of this guide. Split at your own risk!

You can think of them in a similar way to how a company like Coinbase has accounts. If one coinbase customer sends bitcoin to another coinbase customer, that transaction wouldn't be pushed to the blockchain. It would simply be a database entry internal to Coinbase's systems. Same when wallet software such as 'Core' transfers from one 'account' to another within the same wallet. It's just a way for an individual to keep track of their funds, and has nothing to do with the bitcoin network whatsoever.
