You guys think bitcoin will replace the usd in the coming decades. America has spent trillions of dollars against countries who have tried to replace the petrodollar, how can you be so naive to think if bitcoin was any threat to the usd it wouldn't be made illegal?
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:04:21
But no regulations are a good thing.
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:52:28
Right. Because those guys wouldn't be just as shady when you're looking at millions in profit and no regulations.
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:07:07
Yeah the guys who stole millions of dollars
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:04:06
What the hell does that have to do with anything? I never mentioned bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:04:47
Yeah because the change is going to happen that fast
@_date: 2017-01-22 16:07:10
This cements that you're a liar.
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:29:48
That's not true at all. If you ran a small niche store that sold coffee for $25 a cup and you sold 10 every hour, for 14 hours a day like a Starbucks shop that would be easily substanable. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:50:53
I change accounts often. It's funny how you think the day you create your account on social media has anything to do with this. That's like saying "You only used Facebook for two weeks?!? Fucking idiot!"
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:26:12
Okay. You're wrong, but okay.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:15:05
There's no benefit.
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:41:09
If its a high end niche coffee shop that people want to experience then yes it will sell. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:12:58
That would be stupid as fuck. No one is ever going to accept switching over to a system like that.

If you want to be thick that's not my problem.
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:11:50
I'd say it has more to do with scams.
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:46:10
And now it's worth $850 lol.
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:50:45
Who is they because i remember people saying it would be worth millions even back then.
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:11:42
Since when has amazon accepted bitcoin? That is huge news to me if true. What I'm assuming you're talking about is a service which accepts your bitcoin, then places an order with their fiat and later converts your bitcoin into more fiat. That isn't using bitcoin that's just trading currency. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:18:55
Almost back to 900. Not a good sign.
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:15:02
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:49:32
Seven years. It's had seven years and we are no closer to bitcoin being adopted then ever.
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:53:23
The worlds economy is backed by the usd whereas bitcoin is backed by drug dealers.
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:10:32
Buy high sell low!!!!
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:28:25
That's how you think this works huh? I can tolerate the people who foolishly think bitcoin will be the next world currency and buy it but I have no patenience or pity for people like you who try and play bitcoin like a option but have not the slightest idea how options actually work.
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:40:06
So how come Argentinans aren't using bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:29:31
Obviously not when give it a few weeks and that dollar will be worth 40 cents.
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:37:37
No because the drugs go unreported.
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:05:00
Buy high sell low!!!
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:54:38
Lol you're exactly right. And this is the reason bitcoin will never actually be worth anything once the Chinese are done with it. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:07:32
Why would anyone ever continue to use bitcoin then? If people are buying bitcoin to store money then that means only the wealthy are doing it. I've been hearing the Chinese and Indians are putting money in bitcoin. Well if the average American has less than $1000 in savings then the people from these countries probably have even less. People aren't going to put the little amount of money they have into bitcoin because they can't use that to buy necessities. 
So that leaves the rich buying bitcoin. So eventually the rich will own the majority of bitcoin (if they don't already) and leave crumbs for everyone else, exactly the same as fiat. The rich won't be spending that money because there's nothing to spend it on you can't buy property or a yacht with bitcoin. 
People keep spreading this idea that it will be poor third world countries who lead to the rise of bitcoin. That's just a naive and stupid opinion. People in those countries can't wait for a system to be set up to actually spend those coins, they need food and water and cloths now. Not in a month, not in six months.
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:10:52
It's not that people don't get you can have cold storage. It's that it's a very ineffective way of having currency to actually spend, and plenty of exchanges in the lifetime of bitcoin and other alt coins have ran off with hundreds of millions of dollars.
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:20:44
What a horrible analogy. When bitcoin crashes again as it always does please do tell me about all the money you've made as you're buying it at a peak or near peak. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:50:01
I'm actually very curious why you think bitcoin will be worth more than gold. Gold not only has uses in most electronics, but its also been a precious metal for thousands of years and has always held value. The only situation I could see someone turning down gold in exchange for goods is a literal apocalypse scenario in which case like your friend said bitcoin would be useless. You wouldn't even need a total end of the world scenario for bitcoin to become useless, if you simply didn't have power then you don't have anyway of using the coins.
If I have physical gold I can go to my neighbor and trade it for something he has. I can go to the town next to mine and trade it. I can go to a different state and trade it. I can go to India, china, Africa, Mexico, anywhere in the world and my gold would be traceable. If you go somewhere that either doesn't have the infrastructure to support a bitcoin economy or the population simply doesn't want to use bitcoin then your coins are worth less than toilet paper. Gold has held its value through the Black Plague, the world wars, any catastrophe so far. Gold isn't going anywhere and it's not going to lose its value any time soon. The claims such as we might find an asteroid full of gold a mine it thus making gold worthless is just science fiction at the moment and if you base your financial decisions on things like that you're a fool.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:38:49
I put my savings into a bank/credit union. If I absolutely need to I can spend every last penny of that the minute I need to. Forgive me if I'm wrong and please do explain how, but you can't do that with a cold storage can you?
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:41:22
Yes but you are wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-24 22:20:17
If you want to buy bitcoin please do not do it right now. It is going to dip in price no one knows how much or for how long but buying at a peak is the dumbest economy move you could possibly make.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:51:16
Don't tell them that. A fool and his money are easily separated.
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:12:38
Plenty of people make guesses and get it right. I'll be willing to bet that guy sold all his bitcoin because he didn't even believe his own "prediction".
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:14:25
Plenty of things are illegal in china but aren't actually illegal in practice. Take for instance the research chemical market. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:37:57
It would take most people more effort to learn how to use the bitcoin than a $1 profit would be worth. I would throw the paper away because that's silly.
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:14:58
Right if it's under some arbitrary number people have convinced themselves bitcoin will reach then you're a player. I can't even feel bad for you, at least you're making other people money.
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:42:44
Sweet you bought bitcoin at the worst possible time! You should get into stocks too you'll make everyone else a lot of money. Buy high sell low!!!!
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:14:03
Well they're not doing it now. I really doubt they'll adopt bitcoin when cash works just as well and is easier to use. They can go to the grocery store and buy food with cash.
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:18:07


Right when will this be exactly? People have said this since the beginning.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:21:12
oh absolutely a time without internet is no apocalyptic scenario. A hurricane or tornado or any number of other natural disasters is enough to wipe out power for a substantial time. That is a huge reason I cannot ever see bitcoin becoming a real currency, if the times I need my money the absolute most I cannot access it because there's no power then I effectively have no money.
What the hell is the point in mentioning it reacts with chemicals, everything does. I can set dollars on fire, I can melt and burn your physical bitcoin wallets and computers that doesn't mean anything.
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:17:37
But no one is actually using the bitcoin people are just trading it and converting it to usd. If you don't understand why this isn't a real use of bitcoin then idk what to tell you.
@_date: 2016-12-26 04:06:15
Oh wow y'all still using the tier old "bitcoin is internet" 
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:34:49
Apple makes products that tens of millions of people use everyday. In seven years no one has been able to find a real use for bitcoin. Plenty of people who buy these days argue it isn't even a currency. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:01:11
And if America gets nuked and the usd falls apart the price could go to $1000000. It won't though and neither will it ever hit $10000.
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:40:23
What do you mean honored the buy? They have to do that you didn't purchase the coin for $900.
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:12:18
In an ideal situation yes. However you show your ignorance at how the real world works.
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:15:53
Seven years and not a single bit of growth towards mainstream adoption. Ask anyone what bitcoin is and you'll get the same answer as 2009, "huh?"
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:59:01
Which makes bitcoin not a currency.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:50:31
I concede on that point then.
@_date: 2017-04-19 16:19:31
That's fine it doesn't matter if you live in this reality or not. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:46:22
The funny thing is you say this, but people obviously haven't learned. Bitfinex is going to be the next Gox but in all likelihood worse. Actually now that I think about it, they already scammed everyone once with their tokens and when tether ends up crumbling they'll have done it twice. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 13:07:10
Bitcoin is pseudo anonymous plus most people who use it for drugs will tumble the coins first. If anyone could provide you a link to that data then bitcoin would cease to have any real benefit to it. Instead if you'd like to inform yourself look at all the ways you can spend bitcoin legally, versus the popularity of drug services and gambling sites. Most bitcoin is spent on these illegal products. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 16:08:41
Doesn't mean people are using bitcoin for that. The main proponents of bitcoin, like the people in this sub, all preaching holding bitcoin for profit. The only people who spend it are drug users and gamblers who buy it and spend it before the price fluctuates. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 03:10:11
Lol. Wells Fargo is a bank. Every single one of you bitcoiners could close their account and it wouldn't make a splash.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:24:23
What are you even talking about fool?
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:28:00
Because even though it's hit $2000 bitcoin has failed to find any use in over half a decade. Ask yourself are rich people playing with this unregulated currency to make more money and eventually most people will lose a lot or is there some secret use no one is aware of but somehow drives up the price? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:28:24
Exactly all this is instant unlike bitcoin, cheap unlike bitcoin, and easy to use unlike bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:39:39
He didn't want that when he signed up for bitcoin. This is the same as someone saying fuck the police, then calling 911 right after they get robbed. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:08:50
To me that sounds like an arguement for why bitcoin will inevitably fail. If whatever country you're from can do it with the right infrastructure then any should be able to. There will be no point in using bitcoin. 
No one can seriously make the arguement that it's more likely people in third world countries will have the internet connection and the time/will to use bitcoin for small purchases and that the infrastructure will be set up in villages to accept those purchases then for banks just to set everything up and have the fees be lower and the transactions be faster. Bitcoiners keep saying that using bitcoin in third world countries like India, Brazil, Venezuela is what's going to cause mass adoption, but your comment just pretty much showed why it won't. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:28:12
Why are you contacting the government? You bought into a decentralized currency you should have known the risk.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:00:11
Was not one of the main selling points for bitcoin that the transactions were free/minuscule compared to traditional methods such as western union? It doesn't have that going for it, and it doesn't have anonyminity going for it anymore. It seems like a very few selling points that people could come up with for bitcoin are now false so why exactly other than a long term scheme to make money off fools would anyone hold this currency?
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:21:02
Yeah obviously they're mistaken now. You can't rewrite the past to fit the present. Low fees used to be a main selling point and reason to use bitcoin. Yes the people who said that in the past are now mistaken, but you can't just say "oh those people were always wrong just no one knew it yet" because of the fact bitcoin is a different monster now. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:15:15
You're completely wrong though. It might not be one of the main selling points anymore because of obvious reasons but years ago that was always been spouted off. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:26:10
I'm just stating facts.
