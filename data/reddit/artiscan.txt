Tfw when 99% of my money is in Crypto. I've been trying to take out small/big amounts to my bank. But crypto is going up too fast. My balance doesn't budge much.

I had those nights too... Also nights when some hacker just stole my bitcoins and left me with 0.01 btc :(. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:48:37
This money is enough for me to live a decent life... But I'll be trading to get more money :P.
