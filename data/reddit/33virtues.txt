if you mean in terms of the market, likely not unless a major hot wallet gets compromised. other than that, my takeaway was that there are two important attack vectors to consider now: 1) malicious processes (incl. javascript from any random webpage, injectable in most public wifi situations) can run and read keys from memory (hw wallet should be safe), and 2) any merchant or exchange hot wallets running on shared/cloud infrastructure are at immediate risk.
anyone go deep on it and come away with a different take?

A few have lost holdings on Coinbase via SIM transfer or email compromise though. Whether are better off trying to secure their keys on their own is debateable though.

I like the theory. Big question for me is how he faked his way into the top500 list if the supercomputer isn't real.
I think it's likely that he took on investor money, had it highly leveraged in trading, and when the market tanked he had some scrambling to do.

Here here! Nothing is going to change if we don’t get out there and vote, people. Meanwhile, one thing everyone can do is to write your congressmen/prime ministers/other rulers and demand an increase in the price. There is no excuse not to.

The article pretty explicitly states it’s a problem with a specific exchange, not USDT itself. Now, depending on the exchange and the level of abuse, could be a thing, but I doubt it’s a major exchange.

I would either buy a hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor) or generate a cold wallet and set that up as the new destination wallet. If you are worried about the original PC with electrum having been compromised (or becoming compromised in the time it takes you to send a tx), you will want to look into offline signing. Essentially you will unplug that PC from net (or power off your WiFi router long enough to disable WiFi on that single machine), then originate the tx from an online machine, export the unsigned tx via thumb drive, plug that into your original machine, import and sign, back to the on-net machine to broadcast to the net. This way even if the online machine is compromised nobody could originate a different tx address than the one you intend. Good luck!

Really? I thought the ETF holds the underlying asset and that’s what largely determines its price. Not my area of expertise so I probably have some reading to do. Curious now why anyone would buy it and what determines the price if the fund is not backed.

In doomsday scenarios we don’t need exchanges because fiat will likely be worthless. There are very few scenarios where the blockchain fails globally. The network is even more robust now with projects like blocksat. In those scenarios you want water, food, shelter, guns, and medical supplies. When trade starts back up it’s probably metals for small transactions but crypto for very large ones. We don’t need much infrastructure to transact.
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:19:06
Supply is still capped. ETF would hold the bought BTC as the custodian. One reason to buy the ETF is to hold it in your tax advantaged/retirement accounts. So, more demand, higher market price.

Not sure how you can blame bitcoin for bad merchant practice.

I think optionally denominating the Ouya marketplace in Bitcoin could also be huge. Customers and indies could pay and be paid in BTC.

In a word: marketing.
Bitcoin enjoys a significant first-mover advantage, but we do see some value in alternate currencies such as Litecoin and Namecoin.

It stands to reason that accepting bitcoin for Virgin Galactic would be orders of magnitude simpler, logistically, than accepting bitcoin for Virgin Mobile. Due to the volume of customers, significant infrastructure is in place to automate Virgin Mobile billing. This is definitely a marketing stunt (as Branson has built his businesses on), but a real one. I do believe we will see other takers. I do believe other businesses will interpret this signal favorably and accept bitcoin, and I do believe that Branson's existing businesses will be retrofitted to accept bitcoin as soon as the cost-benefit is there (and might already be well underway).
I'm sorry you got in so late, but most of the data points indicate this as still being the early adopter phase. Dive in, the water's great.

I think a closer analogy is with bitcoin to the Internet Protocol itself. We're between versions 4 and 6. We can evolve it through consensus. In the ARPANet of bitcoin we are just barely seeing TCP. Gopher is a long way out.

I don't think it would work.
As mentioned, how do you handle losses. Also, would this only be up until the time the merchant converts to fiat as most merchants still must?
Besides, the correct move as a buyer is to instantly replenish your spent coins at the time of purchase. This keeps the economy flowing but lets you essentially only draw against your fiat reserves. Obiously when there's no liquidity in the market this is tough to do, but usually it's no problem.

It's still strange to me every time someone suggests I'm going to "cash out". The best investment of our lifetime also happens to be directly spendable and I'm going where? Back to fiat? It would be like going back to dial-up because I don't trust this newfangled cable box.

Wow, so it wasn't even an interest free loan. By this logic, imagine if the price had declined just as much. Apparently he would have emailed asking for more than the agreed price at sale.
