No even paper wallets have their flaws. There's a lot you can do to have redundancy, but making paper last through long periods of time means it also is easier to notice the importance of it (lamination, lockbox, etchings, etc)

1) move funds out to another wallet temporarily
2) destroy/erase/generate new wallet on coldcard
3) send back to new coldcard wallet.

TL;DR—The app uses the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode to build a pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) address. The coins sent to the P2SH address are only spendable by a newly generated private key, which is given to the user for safe keeping, digitally or printed. This effectively creates a time-locked paper wallet.
About OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
1. A transaction is only valid if the current time is greater than the transaction's nLockTime parameter (currentTime &gt; nLockTime).
2. When a transaction attempts to spend coins, OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY compares a predetermined timestamp with the nLockTime parameter of the transaction; the transaction is only valid if nLockTime is greater than the timestamp (nLockTime &gt; timestamp).
 and  work together to ensure that a transaction is only valid if the current time is greater than the predetermined timestamp (currentTime &gt; nLockTime &gt; timestamp).
If you're unfamiliar with how Bitcoin transactions, scripts, and P2SH addresses work, you'll need to read up on those before continuing. Here are some articles useful in understanding basic transaction and scripts, and P2SH addresses.
About the P2SH script this app uses
The script used to build the P2SH (i.e. the "redeem script") is:
&lt;timestamp&gt; OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pubKeyHash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG 
This is a standard pay-to-pubkey-hash (P2PKH) script, but with a time-locking element added to it. The script to spend coins at this P2SH address (i.e. the "scriptSig") is:
&lt;sig&gt; &lt;pubKey&gt; &lt;redeemScript&gt; 
Just as with a common P2PKH transaction, only the owner of a specific address may spend the coins sent to the P2SH address. We'll call this person the "recipient".
&lt;timestamp&gt; is a date and time specified by the user when the P2SH address is created—the coins are unspendable until this time.
&lt;pubKeyHash&gt; is the recipient's address.
&lt;sig&gt; is the signature of the transaction, signed with the recipient's private key.
&lt;pubKey&gt; is the recipient's public key.
&lt;redeemScript&gt; is the serialized redeem script.
The recipient's private key must be used in order to spend the time-locked coins, and typical wallets don't support spending from nonstandard P2SH address like this one. To get around this problem (and not require the user to export his wallet's private keys in order to use them in this app), the app generates a fresh private key to use as the recipient. The user must keep this private key safe.
The user is given this new private key, along with the redeem script. This is all that's needed to spend the coins.

Look, given a long enough timeline I personally am going to get as much as financially possible. 
I'm not the only person that feels this way. There are millionaires that can't immediately drop their entire fortune into Bitcoin for no reason. But little by little they are accumulating. The price /has/ to go up because if the timeline is long enough and the price stays right, I alone am going to own a majority of the world's total Bitcoin.  And I won't sell it for less than /maybe/ a million a coin. 
That's just a fact. Obviously this isn't possible. There are a lot of people that aren't even invested yet that have been eyeballing the space. 
Lots of potential. The future is long.

I use the same address for profits on crypto gambling. If only to keep it separate if I need to cash some out on an exchange and don't want them freezing anything for bullshit.

It works fine. This isnt difficult. 
extract the tar file
cd WasabiLinux-1.1.10.2
edit: even easier, lol, just download the .deb file and open it.

you know there's an app for at least Android called wallet of Satoshi that lets you just download the app and immediately start sending and receiving lightning payments?
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:09:12

@_date: 2019-12-26 22:28:19
Like $20
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:29:41
Lol yeesh almost all lightning wallets have simple ways of doing this.

So you can open a channel and make one maybe two purchases? and save a total of what? Four cents? Wow just send the f****** Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:28:14
Eclair, Samourai, the official Bitcoin wallet on Android. Those are just three I know off the top of my head. Think BRD on iOS does as well.

None of those are more /valuable/ than physically owning the gold itself. 
What, 8% of all currency in circulation has a physical backing, right? 
Imagine if 1 in every 5 people decided to go pull out their savings account.

@_date: 2019-12-31 15:14:27
Why dont you just use wasabi for the skeleton wallet of a cold storage?
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:22:47

Cashapp has zero fees and bumps the price by $100. 
Kinda the best currently.
