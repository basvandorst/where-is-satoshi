Yea I'd like to hear an answer to this too. I've never heard a good reason to use Bitcoin to buy something if you're having to purchase coins first.
It's like going somewhere that requires you to buy and use drink tickets, it's a giant hassle.

No it's a great investment because in 3-5 years each coin will be worth $10k because
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:03:22
If it's a better store of value why not buy some to save and then use USD for your normal purchases? If you're buying stuff with BTC and then instantly buying more with USD to replace what you spent you're just wasting time.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:02:13
Lol, it's not that I find it hard. I understand the process you're going through. I just don't think it's worth the hassle.
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:02:22
What industry? People aren't going to like having to buy some other currency to pay you in.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:38:08
Only reason I'm being difficult is that I see everyone praising bitcoin as a huge improvement to the way people do business but in reality it's solving a problem that really doesn't exist for most people. It's a neat technology but I don't see it being used by people in the future.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:13:41
Did you really think it might be legal? Common sense my friend. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:59:22
I bought a gift card online with some reddit tips I got. It was easy to do but it would've been easier for me just to use my debit card than having to buy btc and then use that.

@_date: 2014-03-06 14:57:44
Are you saying the fact that a charge can't be reversed is a good thing or a bad thing?
A lot of people on here keep claiming it's a good thing but I think the average consumer likes the fact that charges can be reversed. If a company screws you over or doesn't deliver a product as expected you can contact your credit card company and they'll help you out. With Bitcoin you're just boned and out the money you paid.
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:03:37
Hah, he never said he was agreeing with them he was just stating facts.
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:54:07
Hah no I'm just making fun of how small the tips are from most bitcoiners. You see someone tip someone else 100 bits and you think "hmm I wonder how much that is" and then you realize it's 3 cents or something. 
I think it's a great cause/idea to donate, that's not what I'm poking fun at.
@_date: 2014-03-15 16:01:48
What's the contingency plan for when the bitcoin exchange you're using fails within the year? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:00:24
If I had the option to buy something with a currency that was going to be worth less in a year or a currency that was going to be worth more in a year I would use the currency that was going to be less in a year.
Why buy with BTC and then rebuy more BTC with dollars when you could just use dollars to make your original purchase to begin with.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:39:24
If you don't have a CC then how are you going to buy bitcoin? If you go to an btc ATM and buy bitcoin you might as well just buy a visa gift card for the amount you need.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:48:44
I agree with you and I'm not saying that it'd be a unique problem to bitcoin. I'm saying that rc111's comment that bitcoin would still be valuable is incorrect. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:48:19
You're missing my point. If you're going to instantly spend dollars to replace the bitcoin you're spending, why not just spend the dollars on the item you want to buy to begin with?
You can buy bitcoin to hold them since the price goes up, but why even spend them if you're just going to buy more. 
Its like someone spending money from a prepaid visa card and then adding more money to it every time instead of just spending the cash on the item to begin with or using a credit/debit card for the purchase. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:52:02
I was just about to make a post like this. There really isn't any benefit to consumers, which is why it's stupid for people to think everyone will be using it in the future.
Most people get paid via direct deposit from their work (or cash a check into a checking account) so it's easier to just use a debit card or a credit card. There's no point in going through the extra step to buy bitcoins to spend them. 
Also, the general public doesn't give 2 shits about how a protocol works behind the scenes. They just want something that works and is easy/quick to use.
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:39:46
Those charities will be able to do a lot with the $0.05 bitcoiners love donating.
Red Cross Employee 1: We're accepting bitcoin donations and have already had 50 donors!
Red Cross Employee 2: Great! How much did we raise?
Red Cross Employee 1: $2.50!

Using bitcoin to buy something is definitely not easier than handing someone cash or swiping a card. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:24:45
You can't, but you're not going to be using cash for any large purchases anyway. If I want to reverse a $20 cash transaction but if I drop a couple grand on something and there is fraud or the person doesn't deliver I definitely want to be paid back for that, which is why I'll use a credit card.
@_date: 2014-06-26 11:49:50
It's so easy to understand. Much simpler than handing someone cash or swiping a debit card. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:17:46
Yes I'm aware of this. What I've been saying is that most people are ok with paying this amount because they appreciate the protection of having chargebacks/reversals. If you buy something with BTC and something happens where you need to get the money back it's going to be almost impossible to get that back without taking the person to court and that's a huge hassle. Most people would rather get the money back from their credit card company and let them deal with it.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:13:09
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:33:45
I'm sorry I just don't see how it's easier than handing someone cash and getting change or quickly swiping a debit card.
It might be safer for some of the reasons you mentioned but I think most people would rather have the benefits of being able to reverse transactions, not have all their coins stolen from exchanges, losing wallets saved on hard drives etc. 
With the Target problem, your bank will reverse any fraudulent transactions and Target is paying for a year of credit monitoring. If someone happened with Bitcoin and you lose coins, you're boned. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:36:33
I know I was agreeing with you. I was just spouting the typical 'coins will be worth XXXXX' arguement that's never backed up with solid evidence.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:02:18
I'm only really talking about what I've seen on Reddit. You're saying the average tip size through changetip on reddit is $1.50?

Lol everything bitcoin related is so scammy. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:09:54
I wasn't just saying it would lose value, I'm saying it would lose 99% of it's value.

Why care about what merchants want you to use, why not just use what's easiest for you. The merchant should try and cater to the customer not the other way around.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:14:59
I'm sure people who tip on Reddit can afford to give more than a nickel when they tip.
It's not that big a deal, I'm just feeling snarky today.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:24:38


Isn't it better to buy BTC and hold them though? Yes you can buy more goods as the price rises but if you spend the bitcoins you lose out on any gains in value they might have. 
So it makes more sense to hold them as an investment since they'll be worth more and more, and spend dollars which are worth less and less.
I'm purely basing this off of the notion a lot of people here have, that BTC will be worth a lot in the future. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:14:09
You'll have dollars because that's what people get paid in. So you will always have a fresh supply of new dollars coming in each paycheck. 
I agree with you on being inclined to save if you have bitcoins, and that's the problem with deflationary currency. The economy works better if people are spending money on goods, not saving a ton.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:19:57
Wait, you invested in a company that became successful and you have no idea how much that investment is worth now or what your payout is going to be? That sounds kinda crazy to me... 
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:11:37
If you're a big follower of Bitcoin and think the price will rise a ton in the future doesn't it make sense to spend USD instead of Bitcoin though? 
Example, if you going to spend 1 BTC on something while it's at $600 a coin and you're expecting the price of BTC to rise up to $1000+ again like some people wouldn't it be better to just save that and use USD? This is the main reason people criticize deflationary currencies. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:20:57
Businesses might like bitcoin for that reason but what really matters is how consumers feel about it. There's no way a business would ever choose Bitcoin solely over normal cash/credit so users are just going to stick with that cause it's easier. 
The only way I could ever see people willingly choosing to use bitcoin over cash/credit is if the store offered a huge discount for it's use and that would negate any of the benefits the store would receive.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:22:40
* it's cleaner (no more exchange of dirty pieces of paper)
   -    a credit/debit card takes care of this
* you always have correct amounts
   -    a credit/debit card takes care of this
* privacy and protection is built-in. fraud detection and reversals have a hidden cost for all users
   -    I think most people are willing to pay for fraud detection and reversals
* no need for an account at a single company (third party) and thus only dependency on the whole network
   -    I don't really understand this one, so instead of relying on a single company, you have to rely on a single program/group of developers?
* standard for everybody. no vendor lock-in. market is more fair.
   -    I don't know much about this so I'll have to take your word. It doesn't sound like it matters to the consumer though.
* not directly linked to the dollar (for people outside U.S.)
   -    I guess it'd help people outside of the US but I figure we've mainly been talking about people who's local currency is stable
* not bound by geographical location
   -    This is one benefit I can see for bitcoin, but it doesn't really apply to the everyday transactions we're talking about
* most trusted ledger in the world. completely transparant and no tampering, not matter how corrupt.
   -    Again, this doesn't really affect day to day transactions in my opinion. Also, coins can be run through tumblers correct?
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:23:32
So are you saying that poor people in the US would be paid in bitcoins? How would they turn their paycheck into bitcoins if that's not the case?
I get the transferring money part, it'd be nice to avoid western union's fees. 
It's nice to avoid the fees that banks have, but they also insure your money through the FDIC and are safer than storing bitcoins I would argue. I for one would rather store my money in a bank than on encrypted hard drives or printed out paper wallets. If you lose those, you're boned. If the bank gets robbed/hacked/etc you'll be reimbursed. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:31:28
If you couldn't trade bitcoin for dollars nobody would want to use it. You couldn't withdraw usd from exchanges which would eliminate the majority of supporters. Businesses wouldn't want to accept it either because they can't buy supplies or pay employees in bitcoin. Bitcoin adoption is weak enough with the fact that it can be traded for dollars, imagine it without that factor.

Definitely a bubble and I'd recommend against it since it sounds like you don't have a lot you could risk. I'd only recommend investing if you have a ton of free cash and like taking huuuge risks.

So you don't have to have a wallet or anything set up to get tips? I've never set up a bitcoin account or anything what would happen if someone tipped me?

Ah ok that makes more sense. So it's not really worth trying any arbitrage because it's so difficult pulling money out of gox?

Genuinely curious here. Are most vendors just accepting a payment on good faith before it's confirmed?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:39:11
How are people doing that though, mainly with cash? Seems kinda sketchy to walk around with $10,000 in cash to buy coins.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:36:14
I think the price is too volatile for people to want to be paid in bitcoin. Who wants to be paid in a currency that might be worth half it's value in a month (or twice it's value but I'm thinking worst outcome). I just don't think it's worth the risk for most people right now.

Ah sweet thanks. So now I have .01 BTC but it's only linked with my Reddit account? If I wanted to try and buy something with it I'd first have to do this: 
[14] EXPORT ACCOUNT
Create a wallet on [15] blockchain.info with your bitcointip bitcoin address preloaded. This command gives you a [16] blockchain.info wallet ID and password. From that wallet you can make transactions from your bitcointip address to other bitcoin addresses without being on reddit. If the bot or reddit is down, you can still access your balance.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:40:00
Is it quick and easy from those sites though?
So mt gox shouldn't be quoted for the price really since the money is almost impossible to move from there?
