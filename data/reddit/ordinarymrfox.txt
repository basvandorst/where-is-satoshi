I am a historian.  Not to be mean, but I would argue that you're taking a very minimalist and incorrect view of Chinese History.  The main thing people have to realize is that China is **massive** and **incredibly old**.  China as we know it today has fought more and larger civil wars amongst itself than all intra-European conflict combined.
My greater point being, this narrative doesn't hold water because the groups competing for Chinese power were looking for technological advantages as much as the Europeans.  The Empire you reference falling in 1911 is the Qing Dynasty, which was actually a group of Non-Chinese Manchus who invaded, took over, and forced everyone to adopt their favorite haircut as a sign of submission (seriously). However, it is very arguable that cultural doctrine inhibited drastic changes more than in Europe.
As for central government - humanity ultimately has two options in its lifespan:  Accept that we are one species of mildly advanced apes and that really the decent thing to do is establish a global society concerned with improving the quality of life for the species as a whole
War with each other divided for mostly arbitrary reasons until we manage to kill everyone off or destroy the ability of the planet to sustain us.
I'm not for the prior option if it had to be done by force, mostly because it can't be done by force.  Judging by our progress on the latter option I'd say there's a good chance humanity is a dead end.
