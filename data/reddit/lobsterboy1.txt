This won't matter if you print or save the webpage for offline use. If you're doing your method of using a safe to store the seed I would just simply write the seed down as it is. But if you want to store the seed on your computer I would not have the bare seeds like I would in a safe, the method above is a way to solve this.
It doesn't have to be websites, it could be emails you sent in the past with links to those. You could go extra crazy and email yourself from two different email providers and then store the email link along with the word locations. You can even create a blog or a YouTube video that you upload to many different sites and follow the same scheme. The possibilities are endless.Of course not saying the seed words but saying something long and boring that contains the seed words. 
It's best to have a backup that is local (your safe) and a backup that is offsite (either the method above or a safety deposit box). If you don't trust safety deposit boxes or giving your bare seeds to someone worries you then you don't have too many options.

If you're storing the seeds at home and don't have a safe for some reason or share a safe you might not want a simple piece of paper with the exact answers. 
And the fear of a fire or hurricane destroying your home and seeds with it is a big fear; having a way to store the seeds on a computer or cloud would be nice. 
You could take one article and the whole first paragraph to make a brain wallet but I would not do that. Maybe add a password in it just to be safe if you want to walk that road? 
Edit: You know, if you took 3 random websites HTML code (or articles) to make a brain wallet that might work? Could even take 3 or maybe 10 random tweets to make brain wallet?
