You didn't ask for help, you asked to find the vulnerability. The vulnerability was using an insecure computer.
If you assume all computers are vulnerable, then the solution is to change the way you create private keys. For small amounts the easiest solution is to distribute the keys using a multi-signature wallet (e.g. Copay). One key on your home computer, one on your phone, and one on your work machine.
For larger amounts, muti-sig and diceware are your friends.

I use  but you can use google's as well 
The scenario we've set up allows my spouse and I to transact as long as we're alive and in agreement (an "and" account). If I die, or my spouse dies, the one living and our heir can spend coins. The heir also receives part of the 4th key. If we both die, the heir receives both halves of the 4th key and can move the coins on their own.
The scenario that led to this is simply that my spouse and I are getting up there in age and we want the keys to be passed on automatically. We are still entrusting a third-party (deadman's switch). But I've not found a better way to do it yet. 
I'd prefer a 1 year, timelock transaction that gets renewed every time we make a deposit. Then when we stop making deposits, the coins are moved. I don't know of any software that makes this easy.

**Billings, Montana,** Donald Fletcher was sentenced to 78 months in prison and 3 years supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $10,000 and a fine of $100,000. Fletcher pled guilty to conspiracy to prepare false tax  returns and commit mail fraud. Acting as a tax consultant, he held seminars and assisted         taxpayers in setting up abusive trust arrangements. He falsely claimed that the trusts would permit taxpayers to deduct personal expenses.

Let’s turn to virtual currencies. Emerging financial technologies are taking us into a new chapter of economic history. They are impacting trading, markets and the entire financial landscape with far ranging implications for capital formation and risk transfer. These emerging technologies include machine learning and artificial intelligence, algorithm-based trading, data analytics, “smart” contracts, and distributed ledger technologies. Over time, these technologies may come to challenge traditional market infrastructure. They are transforming the world around us, and it is no surprise that these technologies are having an equally transformative impact on U.S. capital and derivatives markets.

Synopsis: The state can't opt for Bitcoin - the people should. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:21:31
Credit card: No (visible) fees, cash back rewards. Bitcoin: 1% (minimum) exchange fee. Merchants should offer 2%+ discount when paying with Bitcoin.
Speed: BTC is faster if you have it. If not, it's considerably slower. With the current price decline, it makes no sense to buy BTC today for spending tomorrow.
I am a huge Bitcoin supporter but I'm also pragmatic. We have a long way to go before mass consumer adoption. International, B2B and off-chain micro-payments offer the best short-term opportunities for Bitcoin.

Charts on log scale:
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:58:32
The math used is:
1,000,000/(price/bitcoin in local currency)
At $2600 USD/bitcoin, this yields 1,000,000/2600 =  384.62 bits/USD
This seems correct to me. $1 USD buys 0.00038462 bitcoin (384.62 bits) at $2600/bitcoin.

Charts show the number of bits (1 million per bitcoin) which could be purchased for a single unit of national currency over time. 
e.g. On 1/1/2013 you could buy 74,906.31(bits/USD). Today you can purchase 342.94 for the same dollar.
This shows is the value of national currencies decreasing (dramatically) over the value of Bitcoin.

17,500 sats for a dollar today. The next halving should get that to about 1,000 sat/$. Fees are computed in sat/byte already. No way we're sticking with bitcoin as the unit of account.
Sticking with bitcoin would be like saying, "your coffee will be 0.000143 pounds of gold, please."
