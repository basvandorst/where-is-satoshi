The average transaction fee on Ethereum currently sits at approximately 3USD. Less than bitcoin but still far too expensive to use for everyday purchases.

Anyone can use it on the mainnet, it's permissionless so you don't need to ask the lightning devs permission. It's still not released officially and is expected to still have bugs so caveat emptor.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:40:38
Ethereum does approximately 1.25m per day
Bitcoin does approximately 425k per day, so a little less than half that of ethereum.
Ethereums average transaction fee is $3 compared to bitcoins average of $30 so around 10% of bitcoins.
Ethereums blockchain has grown by over 700% this year and is now 40% larger than bitcoins despite having existed for less than half the time. Eventually this is going to cause problems running and syncing nodes.
Ethereum is able to process more transactions than bitcoin but not enough to handle widespread adoption. No coin has solved scalability yet.

Nothing because TA is the finance equivalent of astrology.

Technical analysis has no scientific basis and doesn't work consistently. Enough people believe that TA works though so it becomes something of a self fulfilling prophesy, doesn't make it any more real than reading tea leaves.

The tech isn't outdated, it's developed with the amount of care required for a 215b dollar project so updates come slowly yet it's still the most advanced. Alts advertise themselves as being able to handle thousands of transactions per second with zero fees yet none ever seem to actually do it. With lightning Bitcoin will demonstrably be able to perform at this level

Correct, there have been 2 halvings so far with the 3rd expected on 4 June 2020
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:14:53
How many Satoshi/byte is that amount?

But he is despised globally.

I use Bitstamp from New Zealand so would be pretty surprised if it wasn't available to US customers.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:59:57
Theres plenty with no call center or support line :)
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:22:57
The person who took the coins doesn't want them found. I'm stunned.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:08:01
Most of the opposition that I've seen is based on the incorrect assumption that lightning nodes will be subject to AML/KYC laws.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:04:35
But this time is different, it actually is the end. Y'know, because reasons.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:17:10
I believe this is the story you're referring to?
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:13:31
They will be able to but not yet. I don't imagine any reputable exchanges will go ahead with lightning until it's officially released. Once it's ready though, I suspect that even if a couple of exchanges offer lightning between other exchanges fees will drop very quickly. A massive number of transactions are just people transferring between exchanges for arbitrage and day trading.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:12:45
Switch to Bitstamp, they don't charge withdrawal fees and have implemented both segwit and batched transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:43:52
Anyone who says they know what the price will do is lying.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:29:47
My thoughts exactly, there's a million of these shitcoin airdrops, Bitcoin Gold, bcash, Bitcoin Diamond, bitcoin SegWit2x, Bitcoin god, bitcoinx
If you're technically inclined there's pretty good money in collecting them. I've made around 10% of the value of my Bitcoin stash from dumping them
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:59:12
The horror!
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:33:07
I don't think we can definitely say that its manipulation. When the price drops the mempool tends to clear as well. Perhaps, for whatever reason, users that send bitcoin in a bear market favour SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:14:16
Yeah, you're massively overpaying - You will be in the next block or 2 if you pay 5-10 sat/byte
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:57:28
On 29 Sept, 13 the price was 134usd. It jumped slightly to 140usd on the 30th. Between the 30th of september it dipped to 105 and ended 17 Oct at 146usd.
Hard to tell how much any of that actually had to do with the shutdown. It continued to run up for the rest of 2013 until it crashed late december when China banned bitcoin for the first of many times and Gox shat itself.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:29:08
And yet, no one has fixed it themselves. Solving scalability isnt as simple as bumping up the blocksize.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:02:57
Probably because outputs per day is a better indicator of overall economic activity on the Bitcoin blockchain than than transactions per day.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:06:45
Because when these other coins begin getting increased usage their fees will increase as well. So many coins advertise themselves as being free and instant while processing a fraction of the transactions that bitcoin does. 
Take any of the coins that offer thousands of transactions per second and try spamming the network with anything near that number, none can handle it. Scaling is not a solved issue, people who say otherwise are lying.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:19:44
Bitstamp doesn't or didn't when I last tried around a month ago
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:19:13
I use a credit card with a similar interest rate. The rewards are pretty neat as long as you pay it off in full each month. I havent paid for a flight with real money in ages :)

What operating System are you running and are you planning to run this node on the testnet or mainnet?
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:15:15
Confusing but there is a hard fork by the name of Lightning Bitcoin. It has nothing to do with the lightning network
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:36:02
Starts with 1: 100% not segwit.
Start with 3: Possibly segwit.
Starts with bc1: 100% segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:37:35
This was well before the video. 
The original video was posted July 17, 2013
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:23:51
This is just a UI issue though, most wallets can easily display the Fiat value of a transaction. Average Joe doesn't need to calculate thousands of a Bitcoin, they can just say 'send 20 bucks worth to x address'
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:43:51
I believe that is lightning nodes, not full bitcoin nodes. Full nodes don't route transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:45:02
Source for 20 percent? I'm seeing more like 12% according to segwit.party/charts though it is gradually edging up
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:17:15
The source code isn't publicly available yet but I think the fork has occurred. At this point you won't be able to collect it. If you want more information about this for or any of the million others is pretty helpful
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:42:42
Lemme know the hashpower of the miner you're using and I can calculate the exact odds of you solo mining a block.
Whatever rig you're using I would describe the odds as 'not in your favour' to put it chartitably.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:07:41
Security is something that needs to be considered in doing this though, my understanding is that running a node involves keeping funds online. Does anyone know the best way to do this as securely as possible?
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:48:55
Is this just coinbase or does it apply to cc purchases on Bitstamp as well?

NZ does have a capital gains tax, it just doesn't apply to everything

People who say it will only go up are idiots. It's crashed many times before and will crash many more times in the future. Over the long run the trend is up.
