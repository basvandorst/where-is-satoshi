Yes, I use (and replenish) the card regularly. The main difference between Wagecan and Shift is that Wagecan converts your BTC when you load the card, so the card carries fiat. Shift, in contrast, converts your BTC when you spend from the card, so the card carries BTC. Wagecan is best when BTC price is falling. Shift is best when the rate is rising.

In 2008 the price of gold immediately plunged along with the bond market. It made no sense to me (or to my broker) at the time. But after several weeks gold recovered while bonds did not. And so, I figure that in the immediate aftermath of a crash, most people will panic and sell everything including cryptos. But then they will see safety in crytos and crypto prices will come back and continue rising.

By 1945, it is true that there were a few more cars in our tiny mountain village, and some were driven by their owners. But my father never deviated from refusing to learn to drive.

When printing was invented, experts said that printed books would never have mass adoption because the learning-curve to read was much too steep for the average peasant (they would forever rely on priests and scholars to do the reading).

I am a commercial seller on LocalBitcoins.com. After nearly a thousand trades over more than a year, I have never been scammed on that site, Not once. There have been a few unsuccessful attempts. I think that trust is the secret. A seller should demonstrate trusworthiness but should not risk serious money with an unknown (untrusted) buyer. I am amazed at sellers who risk thousands of dollars with buyers that they do not know. All the signed receipt-images and bank-manager reassurances in the world aren't worth squat if you cannot trust the buyer.

Many buyers want lower price.

I would be very interested in Molyneux's thoughts on this topic. I shall keep an eye out for a link to his talk when it is posted. I must admit that I am skeptical and would like to be convinced. I have two of his books on anarchy, and have watched him many times on youtube.
Although he always thinks things through, he is sometimes horribly misinformed. He is especially ill-informed regarding the known, replicable dynamics of violence and threats. (FWIW, I am both a historian and certified firearms instructor, and have written on the subject.)
My specific doubt regards cost. In practice, the cost of cowing a huge, able-bodied population into terrified submission by public examples has usually been much less than even the oppressors had expected. (British policies in 1798 Ireland, U.S. lynchings during Jim Crow, Somalia warlords, or Allende's Chile come to mind.)

"Capitalism": You use that word a lot. I don't think it means what you think it means. All the bitcoiners I know, whether in three-piece suits or jeans and t-shirts are enthusiastic capitalists,
The essence of capitalism is that incompetent businesses fail. Their resources are then taken and used by smarter, more competent people. That is how progress works and life gets better.
Banks are not allowed to fail. No matter how idiotic, corrupt, inept, or thieving they are, men with guns (governments) will take money from you (taxes) and give it to them (bailouts). The stupider or more criminal a bank's executives are, the more money they get. That is how civilization crumbles and life gets worse. It is tyranny, not capitalism.

I never said nor implied any such thing. We were talking about risk to the buyer, not risk to the seller. The bitcoin seller always shoulders the burden of risk. Cash deposits can be clawed back from the seller, although not as easily as PayPal, credit cards, ACH, or wire transfers.
Even a face-to-face cash handover can be reversed. The two most common ways are counterfeiting and violence. Billions of fake $100 bills are in circulation. If you get paid with counterfeit currency, it will be confiscated and you will be arrested when you try to deposit it. In the second case, violence is sometimes overt and always implied. The most common scenario: you are holding the cash, you send the bitcoins, the buyer then forcibly grabs the cash from you and jumps into a waiting getaway car at the curb. The least common scenario: you are holding the cash, you send the bitcoins, the buyer then pulls a handgun and demands the money.
Again though, we were talking about the buyer's risks, not the seller's.

True, but there are easy workarounds. I advise a mixed approach. Devise a lengthy phrase that only you could possibly know. For example, “At the Gomez’s 2010 Christmas party, when Uncle Jim put the lampshade on his head, he tripped and knocked the Christmas tree over.” Do not publish it! For extra caution, append something that you can easily look up (like your socsecnum or the first five decimal digits of pi) to the phrase just before generating the private key from it.

Seriously? The advertiser has completed only one trade. (Started three trades, but two were cancelled.) One trade! Probably from his own sock-puppet account.
LBC is not an exchange (like Bitstamp) nor even a broker (like Coinbase). It is simply an open marketplace where buyers and sellers can meet. Hence, there are scamming weasels out there, but there are also many reputable and trustworthy professionals. Reputation is everything. The trick is to choose wisely. Choosing an advertiser with only one trade under his belt would be to choose unwisely.

Why do you think this should be "bigger news"? Not every bitcoiner is a long-term LBC trader, and those who are, probably remain confident that it will soon resume.
I am a commercial seller on LBC. I had just received a bank deposit from a buyer on Sat, when it crashed. It crashed before I could release the buyer's BTC to him. So now I have his money, but he does not yet have his BTC, and we are both stuck. Nevertheless, he and I both know that he will get his BTC the moment it comes back up.
The situation is inconvenient and frustrating, but not "big news".
It certainly cannot compare, for example, with news of Putin's meeting in Beijing tomorrow with reps from China, India, and Iran to implement steps to abandon the petrodollar.

The average U.S. citizen unknowingly commits 3 to 5 federal felonies per day (see "Three Felonies a Day" by Harvey Silverglate, "Go Directly to Jail" by Gene Healy, or "The Tyranny of Good Intentions" by Paul Craig Roberts). No one knows how many, because no one knows how many tens of thousands of new federal regulations are created each year by unelected bureaucrats.
If a federal prosecutor wants to lock you up, you will be locked up, no matter how law-abiding you try to be. It has nothing to do with bitcoins. It has only to do with attracting attention. Remember ancient Chinese curse number two.

I think that the second-worst design decision made, back in the day, was to combine three unrelated functions into one piece of software.
* participating as a 24/7 full node in distributing transactions
* a place to store your privkeys
* a transaction launcher or originator
The worst decision made, was to then label the resultant agglomeration a "wallet" and encourage newbies to use it.

Correct, or by creatively re-interpreting a never-enforced regulation from 1826.

I have Mycellium on two androids: my tab and my phone. For convenience, my same addy is in both wallets. I signed up on my tab, but when I tried to sign up on my phone, Mycellium thinks I am a stranger, even though it is the same addy. What is worse, it says my nickname is already in use.

I agree. "Consumer protection", like all other such innocuous phrases used by the feds, will quickly morph into "let us protect you by taking your money/freedom."
I am reminded of a currently underway project to compell IRA/401K holders to put a predetermined fraction of their nest-egg into govt bonds. The stated goal is to protect IRA/401K holders from bad investment decisions by forcing them to invest in fed debt instruments.

Florida government makes it a crime to: have a beer on Sunday before 10 AM, to spend the night under the same roof with a person of the opposite sex not your spouse, to carry a penknife of any size (varies by city/county/town), and many other silly unenforceable laws. The Federal government has millions of unenforceable regulations.
The only purpose these laws/regulations serve is to give the authorities an excuse to lock you up if you piss off someone in power. Banning bitcoins would be similar; unenforceable in general but selectively enforced to "send a message".  Most people will simply ignore such laws, as they do now.

Online trade via LBC using escrow is also risk-free for the buyer, despite your repeated false implication.
You prefer to sell BTC  by driving to a meeting, I prefer to do it sitting at my desk. Both of us as sellers take risk, although my risk (bank clawback) is greater than yours. On the other hand, your buyers take greater risk (robbery) than mine (escrowed).

"Best"? What does that mean? You want safe, fast, or cheap? You can pick any two.

Bitcoin transfers are irreversible. Every form of fiat transfer is reversible. Hence, it is bitcoin sellers who are routinely scammed, not buyers.
@_date: 2014-02-05 14:44:56
Yes, indeed you can. LBC was originally started to support that method and many commercial sellers use it primarily today. I no longer do.
I used to sell BTC face-to-face until about 8 months ago. After an experience with counterfeit USD, I made my meeting-place the lobby of my credit union, where everyone knows me. I would accept the buyer's cash and hand it to a bank teller. The bank teller verified that the cash was good, and then I immediately transferred the coins to the buyer. Then one day it dawned on me that I did not need actually to be there. If a buyer was willing to hand his cash to a bank teller and receive his BTC instantly, and I could see the deposit as soon as the teller hit her terminal button, why meet physically? The buyer can go to his nearest bank, I can sit at my office desk, and we can do the trade faster, easier, and with less driving.
From the buyer's viewpoint, it may seem safer to look someone in the eye rather than over the internet, but this is an illusion. First, with LBC the seller's coins go into escrow tagged with the buyer's userID the moment that the buyer requests a trade. The seller can only release the escrow to the buyer (presumably after the bank deposit appears online) but cannot get it back. Second, as with any other business, the tradesman's reputation is everything. If a seller has a spotless reputation after trading with several hundred different buyers, physical presence does not really change anything.
In short, if you are more comfortable meeting a seller face-to-face, I would encourage you to do so. Just keep in mind that many no longer consider physical presence necessary.

I think the OP was really asking about the protocol, not about the code for the core wallet implementation. After all, many other wallets (Mycelium, for example) use the protocol.

Not so. You fail to distinguish between responders (customers) and advertisers (businessmen). You must develop a reputation as the former before attempting the latter. Only scammers try to pose as businessmen without having any reputation. Again, reputation is everything. I, for example had a spotless reputation of nearly 100 satifactory completed trades under my belt before launching as a professional seller and placing my first ad.
Sorry to rant, but this is a hot-button with me. I have no sympathy with sheep who enter a free-market marketplace, give their money in a dark alley to someone with zero reputation, and then bleat that the marketplace scammed them. In the immortal words of my favorite philosopher, "If God had not meant them to be shorn, He would not have made them sheep."

I think the Wapo article conflates "slavery"  with mere "involuntary labor" (such as indenture). The former is: (1) lifelong and (2) hereditary. The latter is not.
I am not saying that the latter is moral or any less harsh from the immediate victim's viewpoint. But words have meanings.

Hmm. Interesting question. I wonder.
In the seasteading context: Would it be possible for a private seastead to amass enough military strength to deter by threat of violence, say, the United States?

But merely deterring violence by threat of violence is easier than winning a war.

The following is copied from: 
**1. Must I have a bank account at [whatever bank] in order to make a deposit there?**
No. You may deposit cash into Coqui Firearms Training’s account without owning an account at any of our banks. In general, anyone can deposit cash into anyone else’s bank account. One exception, J.P. Morgan Chase allows only the account owner to deposit cash into an account. (We do not have a Chase account.)
**2. Will the bank teller ask for my name or ID?**
No. Sometimes a bank teller will ask if you are depositing into your own account. Just say “no”. They ask this only because they want to offer you the courtesy of telling you the new account balance. If you say “yes it is my account”, then they will ask for ID. So just say “no”. (See Chase exception in item 1 above; also see item 7 below.)
**3. Must / may I sign the deposit slip?**
No. A signature is used only when the deposit slip also serves as a withdrawal slip. Since you are not taking money out, you should not sign.

It is illegal in Florida to drink beer before 10 AM on Sunday. Someone says "I do this in the privacy of my home". You ask, "So if you drink beer at home, the law does not apply?" The official answer is: the law still applies, and you will be prosecuted if caught. The real-life answer is that local Florida authorities have no way of knowing that you drink beer on Sunday morning in your home.
The point is that people routinely violate with impunity stupid unenforceable laws or regulations.
The deeper question is: What goes through legislators' and bureaucrats' minds when they make laws or regulations whose only impact is to breed contempt for authority and spawn corruption at every level?

Russia is too small an economy to cause a replacement of the dollar with gold as international reserve currency. On the other hand, the Eurozone, Iran, and the other BRICS nations (Brazil, India, South Africa) also want the dollar replaced. The most likely replacement will be IMF SDR's. Both the IMF and the Fed have agreed that this is the direction to go.
If/when this happens, trillions of dollars will flow back into the U.S. This will cause inflation. How much inflation will depend on the Fed's ability to retain control.
Anyone interested in this should read Jim  Rickards's "The Death of Money". It discusses three possibiilities--in decreasing likelihood they are: IMF SDR's, gold, and chaos. The book also mentions Bitcoin (which Rickards likes, but which he doubts will be ready to pick up the slack when SHTF).

"Brainwallet"-generated privkeys can be perfectly safe. The following is an excerpt from "Getting Started With Bitcoins" at 
Devise a lengthy phrase that only you could possibly know. For example, “At the Gomez’s 2010 Christmas party, when Uncle Jim put the lampshade on his head, he tripped and knocked the Christmas tree over.” Then, so you do not forget the phrase, hide it within a tale of Uncle Jim’s other escapades, or inside a story about other Christmas parties. Do not publish it! For extra caution, append something that you can easily look up (like the first five decimal digits of pi “14159″) to the phrase just before generating the private key from it.
Now generate a key-pair from the passphrase. You may now load coins into its public address or send/spend them using its private key, as you wish. But then delete all record of the private key itself. Do not write it down. Do not print it. Do not save it in a flash drive. Do not encrypt it or put it in the cloud. Do not put it into any computer, whether connected to the internet or not. Destroy it. Delete it. Forget it. Whenever you want to spend your coins, use the same phrase with the same app to generate the same key-pair again.
Of course, such serious security applies only to your savings or nest-egg stashes (good to have more than one nest-egg stash). Your day-to-day spending key-pair can be kept on your cellphone and/or tablet (same key-pair on every device from which you send/spend). If you lose the device or its private key becomes known, you will lose only spending money.

It is so frustrating that novice bitcoiners conflate where/how to store private keys with the software needed to send/spend bitcoins. They are two different things.
Your private keys for serious money should never be in any computer, except for the brief moment when you spend/send some of it.
The software you use to send/spend bitcoins should store only the private keys to trivial spending money.

Why do you prefer to be forced into sound business practice? Why not simply offer a money-back satisfaction guarantee. I sell BTC commercially and my ads all say that  the buyer is entitled to a full refund if they request it within 24 hours of their purchase.
Or perhaps I misunderstand. Perhaps what you are saying is that, while you have the right to set your own business practices, your competitors should be forced by the state to conform to practices that you set for them.

"Just a credit card" (no bank account link) is hard. You could join Second Life, then buy Lindens at Virvox with cc, then buy BTC at Virvox with Lindens. It is costly and tedious but works.
You are unlikely to find a direct seller because, after receiving the BTC, you could tell the cc company that you were defrauded. They will then claw back the USD from the seller, so you wind up with both BTC and USD.
I am a professional seller on Localbitcoins and sometimes accept cc but only from long-term trusted customers.

LBC escrow procedures protect the buyer, not the seller.
It is true that you will attract more buyers as you develop a reputation for politeness, businesslike attitude, speed, reliability, and honesty. Being patient with newbs is especially appreciated.
Nevertheless, when push comes to shove you are much more likely to be ripped off due to inexperience than to not attract customers. Once a trade is opened, you no longer have access to the escrowed BTC. Once the buyer pays fiat (by whatever means) you have little choice but to release his coins. Once he has received his coins he can claw back his fiat payment. Memorize this: **Every form of fiat payment can be reversed**.

Russia has just dropped another bombshell, announcing not only the de-coupling of its trade from the dollar, but also that its hydrocarbon trade will in the future be carried out in rubles and local currencies of its trading partners - no longer in dollars - see Voice of Russia 
Russia's trade in hydrocarbons amounts to about a trillion dollars per year. Other countries, especially the BRICS and BRCIS-associates (BRICSA) may soon follow suit and join forces with Russia, abandoning the 'petro-dollar' as trading unit for oil and gas. This could amount to tens of trillions in loss for demand of petro-dollars per year (US GDP about 17 trillion dollars - December 2013) - leaving an important dent in the US economy would be an understatement. 
Added to this is the declaration today by Russia's Press TV - China will re-open the old Silk Road as a new trading route linking Germany, Russia and China, allowing to connect and develop new markets along the road, especially in Central Asia, where this new project will bring economic and political stability, and in Western China provinces,where "New Areas" of development will be created. The first one will be the Lanzhou New Area in China's Northwestern Gansu Province, one of China's poorest regions. 
"During his visit to Duisburg, Chinese President Xi Jinping made a master stroke of economic diplomacy that runs directly counter to the Washington neo-conservative faction's effort to bring a new confrontation between NATO and Russia." (press TV, April 6, 2014) 
"Using the role of Duisburg as the world's largest inland harbor, an historic transportation hub of Europe and of Germany's Ruhr steel industry center, he proposed that Germany and China cooperate on building a new "economic Silk Road" linking China and Europe. The implications for economic growth across Eurasia are staggering."
Curiously, western media have so far been oblivious to both events. It seems like a desire to extending the falsehood of our western illusion and arrogance - as long as the silence will bear. 
Germany, the economic driver of Europe - the world's fourth largest economy (US$ 3.6 trillion GDP) - on the western end of the new trading axis, will be like a giant magnet, attracting other European trading partners of Germany's to the New Silk Road. What looks like a future gain for Russia and China, also bringing about security and stability, would be a lethal loss for Washington. 
In addition, the BRICS are preparing to launch a new currency - composed by a basket of their local currencies - to be used for international trading, as well as for a new reserve currency, replacing the rather worthless debt ridden dollar - a welcome feat for the world. 
Along with the new BRICS(A) currency will come a new international payment settlement system, replacing the SWIFT and IBAN exchanges, thereby breaking the hegemony of the infamous privately owned currency and gold manipulator, the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) in Basle, Switzerland - also called the central bank of all central banks. 
To be sure - the BIS is a privately owned for profit institution, was created in the early 1930's, in the midst of the big economic melt-down of the 20th Century. The BIS was formed precisely for that purpose - to control the world's monetary system, along with the also privately owned FED and the Wall Street Banksters - the epitome of private unregulated ownership. 
The BIS is known to hold at least half a dozen secret meetings per year, attended by the world's elite, deciding the fate of countries and entire populations. Their demise would be another welcome new development. 
As the new trading road and monetary system will take hold, other countries and nations, so far in the claws of US dependence, will flock to the 'new system', gradually isolating Washington's military industrial economy (sic) and its NATO killing machine. 
This Economic Sea Change may bring the empire to its knees, without spilling a drop of blood. An area of new hope for justice and more equality, a rebirth of sovereign states, may dawn and turn the spiral of darkness into a spiral of light.

Guys, you misunderstand. You assume that clear intent is buried somewhere within the text, and all you have to do is learn what that intent is---how the authorities will interpret it. In fact most regulations are deliberately, carefully crafted to be ambiguous. This enables bureaucrats to prosecute whomever they wish and to indulge whomever they wish. The primary goal of all regulation is to give unassailable power to the bureaucrat via creative ambiguity.

They did it to me also.
Oddly, they did it after my pulling BTC from an instant buy but before they ACH-pulled my payment from my bank account. Since they had closed my Circle account, their system would no longer let them pull the payment. This meant that I owed them money but had no way to pay them. They became increasingly irrational in demanding the money but refusing to suggest how--not even an address where I could snail-mail a paper check. Eventually I got the money to them, but not before I became convinced that they were a bunch of loud, threatening, but inept bullies.

Although not as corrupt as the federal government, all states have stupid unenforceable laws. But when it comes to Florida, Title 798.02 [ probably takes the cake. It makes it a crime punishable by imprisonment for "any man and woman, not being married to each other [to] cohabit together."
There is irony here. Title 798.03 (repealed during the civil rights era) made it a much more serious crime for an unmarried couple of different "races" to cohabit. The irony? Because 798.03 was repealed, but 798.02 is still in force, unmarried Florida cohabiters apparently are legal today only if they are of different "races".
Go figure.

I use Mycelium and consider it the best BTC-sending-and-receiving app so far. But I am not currently selling via Mycelium because LBC sales already keep me busy.
Regarding face-to-face sales, although I used to do quite a bit, I no longer seek them. For security, I used to meet buyers in the lobby of my bank, where everyone knows me. To avoid possible counterfeit bills, I would ask a teller to check the cash before I sent the BTC. Then one day it dawned on me that if my buyers were willing to walk into a bank and hand their cash to a teller, then I did not have to be there. So today, virtually all of my sales are remote. See  for details.

Interesting situation. As in any business, profit--indeed survival--depends on establishing a reputation for honesty and reliability. Such reputations take years to build. They are valuable, and so real-life business reputations are often sold,. They appear in the buyer's ledger as "good will". There is no obvious reason why trade in reputations should be any different than in any other business asset.
Of course, knowing that the founder sold out to someone else makes the business's customers nervous and on the lookout for any fall in quality of service. Caveat emptor.

Do I mention bitcoins to a bank? Absolutely not! Never!
Should you switch to business accounts? I probably would, since their pattern of deposits and withdrawals are unlikely to match personal account expectations. Typical personal accounts have one or two large salary deposits per month and a bunch of small bill-pays. Business accounts (such as the ones I use for BTC sales) have more deposits than withdrawals. The wrong pattern is a red flag.

It is impossible to say whether buying BTC is "legal". In the U.S., every city, county, school district, and state as well as the feds makes up their own ordinances and statutes. Every bureaucracy makes up its own regulations, law or no law. Thousands of laws and regulations are never enforced unless you piss off someone in power. (For example, here in Florida it is a crime for a man and a woman who are not married to each other to spend the night under the same roof.) And countless other statutes are worded with such carefully crafted ambiguity and vagueness that they can be used against anyone at any time. The best person to ask whether any particular act could be considered lawbreaking is a defense attorney. The answer will always be "yes", but at least you will learn the safest way to avoid frivolous or malicious prosecution.

What he said. The problem is that you could claw back your reversible PayPal payment and then run off with the seller's bitcoins. Hence, the only bitcoin sellers who are willing to accept PayPal either limit themseles to long-term trusted customers (like me) or charge exorbitant prices to compensate for the inevitable thefts (like virvox).

Excerpt from my article, "Getting Started With Bitcoins"  ...
The resemblance to a numbered secret bank account is scary. Some unschooled people do not want to bother with private keys and public addresses. Instead, they leave their bicoins in a service that promises to keep their money safe. DO NOT DO THIS! If you buy BTC with USD at an exchange, withdraw the BTC to a private key-pair as soon as practical. If you sell BTC for USD at an exchange, withdraw the USD to a private bank account as soon as practical. Leaving either BTC or USD in an exchange is like buying jewelry at a store and then leaving your purchase and your money on the counter when you walk out.
In the future someday, bonded, insured, audited, regulated, trustworthy services may arise to serve this market. But they do not yet exist. Leave your bitcoins or private key for safekeeping with anyone, and you will lose your money with no legal recourse. *You have been warned!*

I have no idea what went on at their end. My best guess is:
(1) The error message they got from their system refusing to pull funds was incorrect, so tech support guy  thought that I was somehow blocking the pull.
(2) The person(s) who closed my account lacked a way to inform all the tech support staff. So one tech support guy kept insisting that I pay thru my Circle account (not knowing that it had been closed). While  the other tech support guy knew the account was closed but did not realize that this very fact was stopping the pull (because of the incorrect error message).
But this is just a guess, based on my 35 years as a computer scientist and business consultant in information systems. My grandfatherly advice to inexperienced youngsters like yourself is this: Despite individuals being smart, organizations often act with reptilian stupidity.

First, I should explain that, before retiring in 1999, I was a published computer scientist with my own international software consulting company. Just for fun, I still write Tasker apps for my Android devices.
I became interested in bitcoins in 2011 after reading the Satoshi white paper and realized that it would change the world. I put some money into it over the next two years. For the past two years I have been an LBC "Pro Trader" helping newcomers get into bitcoins. Finally, as someone living off savings, I prefer to  keep a significant fraction of my nest egg outside of fiat because I believe that fiat hyperinflation is inevitable by 2019. The non-fiat portion is split about 50-50 between physical gold and bitcoins.

Very well said! Thank you. I would only expand the security dilemma a bit.
If you hide your private keys too deeply you may forget or lose them. If you make them easier to retrieve, a thief might steal them. Either way you lose your money.
The only way to avoid the security dilemma is to pay someone you trust to hold your money (i.e.: use a bank and avoid crypto).

Last week I had two fraudulent $75 charges hit my Coinbase/Shift card within minutes of each other. I immediately emptied the source wallet, closed the card, and ordered a new one. Two subsequent attempted fraudulent charges were then declined. Backtracking, I believe the charges came from someone who copied the card info at a Marriott where I stayed.
I suggest that Coinbase/Shift enable online card activation/deactivation as a feature.

Your concerns are not misguided. In my experience, most people do not wish to (or cannot) learn how to safely handle their own money. So they pay others whom they trust to do it. This is why few hold physical gold, wads of $100-dollar bills, or bitcoins, and never will.

I bought a Bitseed when they first came out. I recommend it highly. For $150 you get a no-brainer system that runs out of the box. You can choose to run either a core node or an XT. Both work fine. The former is "official", the latter will continue to work no matter how the blocksize conflict resolves.

Once I am convinced that you are trustworthy, I will accept PayPal from you. The problem is that online payment methods (PayPal, credit card, Popmoney, ACH, etc.) are easily reversed while bitcoin transfer is irrevocable. An untrustwortthy buyer can pay, receive the bitcons, then claw back the payment, thus stealing from me and I would have no recourse. It happens all the time to inexperienced vendors. It is sad that the world is full of unscrupulous cheats, but it is what it is. Become a trusted customer and vendors will then accept your online payment. It will still be immediate, reliable, and anonymous.

@_date: 2015-08-16 23:16:24
The answer to your first question is that I will tag you as a "trusted" buyer after you make a certain number of smooth, uneventful purchases.
Your second question has two answers. First, the moment that you place an order in LBC, the bitcoins are taken from my LBC account and placed in escrow under your account. From then on I cannot retrieve them as long as the order is open. All I can do is release them to you. Of course, you cannot retrieve them either until I release them. Furthermore, only you can cancel the order, releasing the escrow back to me. I cannot do so. Hence, I have no incentive to take your money and refuse to release your escrowed BTC. I cannot get them back. If I refused to release after you paid, you would upload an image of your deposit receipt to the admins and they would  forcibly release your escrowed coins to you and then ban me, wrecking a reputation that has taken me three years to build.
The second answer is at  It is my reputation--spotless with zero complaints after over 3000 sales to over 1500 satisfied buyers. Indeed, i believe that I am the only vendor who publishes a written no-questions-asked money back guarantee if you are ever disatisfied with a purchase,
To learn details, we should converse privately. To do this, join LBC and place an order with me for the minimum ($20). The order page itself enables private messaging. You can always cancel the order with no penalty.

@_date: 2015-08-16 17:31:21
I agree. The trend is already underway for miners, key managers, and transaction broadcasters.
I guess my rant was provoked by having recently switched my full node from Core to XT. I did this for the obvious technical reason that my node will now continue to work **no matter how the block size conflict resolves**. But, although to me the choice was an engineering no-brainer, it has been vilified by some as ideological heresy. Strange.

I am certain this is the case. I am a pro LBC vendor (thousands of trades) and have a very steep markup. Newbs sometimes place an order for, say, $100 and ignore that the screen tells them they will get 0.33 BTC. But when I deliver the 0.33 BTC they just bought, they complain (correctly) that this is worth only $82 on Coinbase. They ask where the other $18 (my markup) went. For those incapable of grasping the concept, I offer their money back if they return the BTC.

LOL! Actually, that is not a bad idea.
Buying from an exchange (Bitstamp, BTC-E, BTCChina, Coinbase, etc.) will get you the best price. The drawback is that you must provide personal data, then await days or weeks for your identity to be  verified, then wait a few days after sending money each time to receive your bitcoins, due to the slow banking system.
Buying from individuals (via LocalBitcoins or BitQuick) is immediate and anonymous, but you will pay a premium price for the convenience.

Correct. Other sellers have lower markups. I encourage every buyer to shop around. Every buyer should weight speed/privacy versus price. For lowest markup (but slowest and least private), use Coinbase or Circle. For fastest and most private (but higher markup) use me. Every buyer is different. Every vendor is different. Every buyer chooses.

Like every other businessman, I set my price so as to maximize my profit. If I were to lower my price, my profit per sale would drop; any higher and the number of sales would fall off. If you have a better approach, please feel free to try it. I welcome and encourage competition.
But I think that the question you really meant to ask is "Why are buyers willing to pay the markup?" I do not know for certain, but it is probably because I:
* deliver within seconds,
* ask for no personal info,
* require no receipt,
* am scrupulousy honest,
* offer a no-questions-asked money-back guarantee to any buyer who is dissatisfied or changes his mind, and, finally,
* because I have the patience to explain everything simply and in detail to novices.

Many people dislike the site's owner. Nevertheless, the question was about non-registering. It is the only site that allows anonymity. You place a bet by sending BTC. The automated system then sends your winnings back to your address (assuming you win). I have used the automated site and found it to be honest, despite its unsavory owner. Problems arise and must be solved by fallible human intervention only when bets are ambiguous (e.g.: betting on the mtGox rate and then having mtGox collapse and vanish).
Regarding the KY/ND game, the OP should create a new bet and hope that others join it.

There are literally thousands of laws here in Florida that outlaw victimless "crimes" such as gambling, drinking on Sunday, prostitution, smoking, and the like. They are ignored by everyone. There are literally tens of thousands of mutually contradictory federal regulations that law-abiding citizens unknowingly violate every day.

According to CB, your price is locked when you place the order, even though your ACH payment takes several days. So in theory, it makes no difference. But in practice CB has been known to unilaterally cancel orders during the ACH delay period, for mysterious reasons of their own, especially if the price rockets in the days after you place the order. But if your dollars are ready at CB when you place the order, the buy is consumated instantly.

If your intent is just to buy bitcoins, then ACH-to-BTC will take the same time (3 or 4 business days) as ACH-to-USD wallet (3 or 4 business days) plus USD wallet-to-BTC  (instantaneous).

Nowadays I sell via cash bank deposit and buy via PayPal.
I traded face-to-face when I first started, but no longer do so. After an experience with counterfeit USD, I would meet buyers in the lobby of my credit union (where everyone knows me).

Like crackanape said, although the 80-20 estimate is imprecise, the price doubling of the past two weeks cannot possibly reflect a doubling (in the past two weeks alone) in the use of bc to buy and sell stuff. So, by inference, it must overwhelmingly reflect speculation.

Yes. That is the case. For example, if she tells the bank that someone stole her identity and made the transfer without her knowledge, the bank will take it back (and probably freeze your account). If you already withdrew the money, then you will be overdrawn, just like writing a bad check, with all the consequences that implies.

The problem is not that banks suffer from reptilian stupidity. They do of course, but the problem is oppression by unelected bureaucrats who enjoy wielding their powers. If/when BTC comes under government control, the same insolent bureaucrats will be just as tyrranical in stopping BTC transfers.

Wait a minute. I am still not grasping the need for a nonce. As I understand it, the goal is to prove that coqui33 owns bitcoin address 1NB...TTLA. This is so that the amount of BTC in that address, plus how long the value has resided there, quantifies the trustworthiness of coqui33. But it seems to me that proving coqui33's ownership of 1NB...TTLA can be done without a nonce. Assume that you are the bad guy.
I create a message containing my GPG nickname and my bitcoin address. I sign the message with my bitcoin address's privkey and post the message and its signature publicly. Anyone can read the publicly posted message and verify its signature with my bitcoin address (which is displayed in the message). No one but the possessor of that bitcoin private key (me) could possibly have signed the message. And nobody could have tampered with the GPG nickname or the bitcoin address in the message after I signed it, because signature verification would then fail. How can you now pretend that you, not I, own the address? How can you now pretend that you, not I, are coqui33?
You can c/p my publicly posted message and send it to someone else, claiming to be me. But all you are sending is undeniable proof that the guy who signed the original message (me) owns its bitcoin address. You cannot tamper with the info in the message because you cannot re-encrypt it without the original privkey. This seems too easy. What am I missing here?

Precisely so. It would apply **only** to U.S. citizens, no matter where they live and work.
This reminds me of 1964 when Xerox introduced the first commercial fax machine to use telephone communications. Fearing that faxes would take business away from the U.S. Postal Service, congress immediately passed a bill decreeing that only the post office could send faxes and it would be illegal for private individuals to do so. Eventually cooler heads prevailed and the bill never became law. Such would not be the case today.

What duxie said (below) The beauty of bitcoins is that if you generate a key-pair that only you know, and send your coins to that key-pair's public address, then nobody, NOBODY! can spend your coins without the pair's private key. The real issue is how to keep the private key totally secret but not forget it. Sort of like the number to an old-fashioned anonymous numbered Swiss bank account.

Not true. First, the bitcoins are escrowed. Once the buyer starts the trade, I no longer have access to them. Second, the buyer's bank account is not involved. In fact, the buyer need not even have a bank acount. Only the seller's (my) bank account is involved. And if my bank account were frozen, it would have no impact on the buyer. He already has his BTC.

I cannot opine from the buyer's viewpoint, but as a seller I stopped doing face-to-face several weeks ago. After a counterfeit U.S. bills incident, I began meeting f-to-f buyers at my bank, so that I could have the teller check the bills before I transferred the coins. Buyers seemed happy with this arrangement. Then one day it dawned on me that if a buyer was happy handing cash to a bank teller, why not just have him deposit to my account and save us both the trip, the gas, and the inconvenience of face-to-face.

Few merchants today accept bitcoins. But if bitcoins become popular as a medium of exchange for minor purchases, they will favor the seller, not the buyer. Consider the most popular internet scam today, which stole over half a billion dollars from merchants in 2009, and has grown since then. Here is how the scam works:
Your business is to sell $500 laptops. An online customer buys one with a credit card or Paypal transfer. You ship the laptop to the address he gives. (Alternatively, he stops by your store, identifies himself with the credit card or Paypal transaction number, and carries the laptop away.) A month or two passes. Then, an email from Paypal or the credit-card bank says that they are taking back the $500 because the customer says that he never ordered nor received any laptop. He says that he must have been a victim of identity theft. They take back the $500. You have no choice. You are out the laptop and the $500.
(1) What if the customer is lying, is enjoying his new laptop, and merely claims identity theft in order to steal from you? (2) What if the customer is telling the truth and the thief (who got the laptop) used his credit card or Paypal account? (3) What if (the most popular variant) the customer actually wanted to buy some hubcaps, not a laptop, and sent the Paypal money to you following the hubcap seller’s instructions, who then picked up the laptop and vanished, with never any intent to deliver hubcaps to the fool. He just wanted a free laptop. (4) What if… The "what ifs" are endless. The point is that, no matter how it went down, the bank or Paypal will take back the $500. You have no choice. You are out the laptop and the $500.
Same scenario, but now the online customer pays you with bitcoins instead of Paypal or credit card. You turn over the laptop. A month later, he says that he wants his money back because [whatever]. You tell him to go pound salt. End of story.
Again, if/when bitcoins become popular as a medium of exchange for minor purchases, they will favor the seller.

2. You buy the BTC and send them w/o transaction fees to MtGox, where you sell them.

Friction. Hysteresis. The cost and delay of exchanging BTC for fiat (and vice-versa), plus the cost and delay of moving money between exchanges is still high compared to, say, forex. Friction will likely come down as traders maintain large balances in multiple exchanges, letting them sell BTC on one exchange while buying on another without moving anything between the two exchanges. Markets are also very shallow compared to fiat. (BTC-E "ask" might be at 33.33,say, but only two bitcoins might be available at that price.)  Give it time.

When the buyer starts a trade, the system immediately takes the BTC from you and puts them into an escrow tagged with the buyer's userID. You can no longer get them back. You are expected to release the BTC as soon as you get the PayPal. Those are your only choices: release the escrow or not. Again, you can no longer get the BTC back. If you fail to release the buyer's escrow in 24 hours, he will click on the "Dispute" button, upload his PayPal payment notice, and three things will happen:
1. The admins will release the escrow
2. The buyer will report your attempted theft on your feedback
3. You will never get another trade on LBC

Your bitcoins are not in any wallet. They are in the cloud. Your bitcoins can be spent only by someone who knows the bitcoins' privkey and loads the prvkey into a spending program. A wallet is nothing more than a handy place to store privkeys. My advice is not store your privkeys in a wallet at all, since this tells everyone where the privkeys are hidden.
For example, I have 7 privkeys with different balances, which I use for different purposes. None of those privkeys resides in a wallet. None. When I want to spend from a privkey, I load the privkey into spending software, spend it, and then delete if from the spending software.
You ask, "Well if you do not keep your secret privkeys in  any wallet anywhere, then where do you keep them?"
I answer, "I am not going to tell you. Duh!"

IMHO, your day-to-day petit-cash privkey should never hold more than $50 or so. Identical copies should be loaded into your desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, and blockchain.info so that you always have a copy available whenever you want to spend or receive.
Your nest-egg savings privkeys should not be loaded into any computer (just the addresses) until the moment when you want to spend them. Not into any computer: not a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or website, and certainly not in a cloud service.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:38:38
No, they are not safe. A thief does not need access to your wallet in order to steal your coins. Your coins are in the cloud, they are not in the wallet. A thief who knows or guesses your private key can send/spend them.

One possibility would be to decree a U.S. federal regulation with a $10,000 minimum first-offense fine against anyone who accepts unapproved coins or coins from an unapproved address. I would imagine that the vast majority of Americans would knuckle under, just as they do today for the same penalty for failing to report to the feds their accounts with MtGox, Bitstamp, BTC-e, etc.

What you seek is called "coin control". It means that you can specify exactly from which address money is to be sent, and exactly into which address change is to be returned (I usually use the same address). Some wallets have this ability. most do not. Of the wallets that offer coin control, the easiest is to use blockchain.info:
(1) Import your private key.
(2) Archive any other addresses.
(3) Spend your money.
(4) Archive (or delete) your privkey addy in blockchain.info.
... when you want to spend again, return to step 1.
Obviously, this is tedious, so I predict you will eventually go to one or two brain key-pairs for long-term savings (not even loaded into a wallet until you need to spend from them), and one or two key-pairs for day-to-day stuff (loaded into smartphone Spinner or blockchain.info).

As stated in  my advice is for casual new users who "just want to get a few coins and play around with them." It does not apply to day traders like you or professional commercial traders like me.

It is possible (and advisable) to export the key-pairs that you have in "blockchain.info" and put those very same key-pairs also into desktop wallet, tablet wallet, and/or smartphone wallet. That way, no matter which wallet has a problem, you can still spend the coins from another wallet.
Don't forget: your wallets do not contain any coins. The wallets merely hold key-pairs and let you spend from those key-pairs. The coins are in the cloud, so to speak.

Really? You are badly in error (or worse) if you really mean this, since even noobs know that their bitcoins are in the blockchain and that wallets hold only keypairs.
Alternatively, if you mean that you store the keypairs offline, why would anyone reveal their keypairs to you, rather simply keeping them secret?

Was the trade cancelled automatically by a time-out, or did the buyer cancel it manually?
If the former (the trade timed out), then open the now-cancelled trade web page, scroll down, and you will see a yellowish-orange button at lower-left labeled "reopen escrow". Click on that button, then release the buyer's coins.
If the buyer manually cancelled the trade but paid anyway, I suggest contacting LBC support. I also suggest than you ban him from future trades with you.

Why? Criminals exist. Society has a duty to prevent crime or deter it by punishing criminals. But today's tragedy is that instead of punishing criminals, U.S. polity reacts to crime by punishing the law-abiding.
It criminalizes pot-smoking while arming murderous drug lords. It criminalizes gun-possession while ignoring that every mass-shooting over the past quarter-century has happened in a gun-free zone. It takes money from those who buy and sell honestly but ignores massive extortion, corruption, and coercion at every federal level  and in every UN agency.
"Shitty humans" will increasingly outnumber honest ones as society increasingly tolerates the former but punishes the latter.

Go to
and see tgb29's feedback. As you can see, he has traded with 113 buyers and has _never_ received a complaint. Not once.
Furthermore, it would be extremely difficult for a bank cash-deposit seller on LBC to rip off a buyer. The moment that you (the buyer) click on "Send trade request," the system takes the bitcoins from the seller and puts them into escrow tagged with your user-ID. At that point the seller cannot get them back. All he can do is either:  (1) release the bitcoins from escrow to you (presumably, when he sees that you have made the deposit) or (2) refuse to release them. Either way, he cannot get them back.
If the seller refuses to release your escrowed coins after you make the deposit, all you have to do is post a support ticket. You will probably be asked to email the admins an image of your bank-teller receipt. When you do this, the admins will release the coins to you. They will then probably come down hard on the seller, You will then post your experience on the seller's profile, thus ruining his business.
As a high-volume seller, it is inconceivable to me that a reputable seller would wreck his own business by refusing to release a buyer's escrowed coins after the buyer made the deposit and can prove it. Especially since he has no way of getting them back out of your escrow for himself.

I feel sympathy for those who lost money in the fake image scam. But my sympathy is tempered by observing that every victim violated all three of the basic rules for internet money-handling.
* 1. Never open a file from an untrusted source while inside a website that can send your money away.  See 
* 2. Never leave your bitcoins in someone else's wallet. The strength of bitcoins is that if no one knows your private key, no one can spend your coins. The victims were bitcoin sellers, so they had no choice but to put some coins into LBC's wallet. But since all merchants must take such risk, the rule is to put only as much in the middleman's (LBC's) wallet as you want to sell right now, and replenish after each sale. See 
* 3. Always use 2-factor authentication in any website that can send your money away. See 
If the victims had followed **even one** of those rules, they would not have been ripped off.

Part of the problem is that in our species the ability to learn deteriorates steadily from age 20 on. In 1890, when my grandfather was 20 years old, most people were scared and suspicious of gasoline engines. When early adopters invited friends and relatives to ride in automobiles, they were buried under storms of questions demanding to know how the strange things worked. Explaining piston and cylinder made people ask about combustion. Explaining the combustion chamber made them ask what ignited the fuel. Explaining spark plugs made them ask what is "electricity", and on and on. Trying to answer an endless series of questions asked by people who are (1) uninformed and (2) unable to absorb new knowledge was and is a hopeless task. My grandfather died in 1950, having never driven a car (he employed a chauffer). According Alvin Toffler, every innovation takes a full generation to be absorbed into society. Bitcoins still have 20 years to go.

This is called the "man-in-the-middle scam". It is very common with online purchase credit-card transactions, which leave the merchant defrauded. It is becoming increasingly common with BTC sales for bank cash deposit, which leave the customer defrauded and the merchant under police and bank suspicion.

I would like to hear suggestions from other BTC sellers on how to evade it consistently.

Right. Like confidence in the law of gravity is backed only by Isaac Newton's word that it won't change from inverse square of distance. The author either has failed to research the topic or is intellectually incapable of grasping that some things cannot be spun. Whether the thesis is correct is irrelevant; the argument lacks credibility.

Once a public offer is accepted, an ethical seller would stand by the offer that he made. To do otherwise is called "bait-and-switch". The seller in this case is unethical.

FAQs: 
LBC was originally started to support face-to-face and many sellers use it primarily today. I no longer do.
I used to sell BTC face-to-face but stopped doing so about 6 months ago. After an experience with counterfeit USD, I made my meeting-place the lobby of my credit union, where everyone knows me. I would accept the buyer'a cash and hand it to a bank teller. The bank teller verified that the cash was good, and then I immediately transferred the coins to the buyer. Then one day it dawned on me that I did not need actually to be there. If a buyer was willing to hand his cash to a bank teller and receive his BTC instantly, and I could see the deposit as soon as the teller hit her terminal button, why meet physically? The buyer can go to his nearest bank, I can sit at my office desk, and we can do the trade faster, easier, and with less driving.
From the buyer's viewpoint, it may seem safer to look someone in the eye rather than over the internet, but this is an illusion. First, with LBC the seller's coins go into escrow tagged with the buyer's userID the moment that the buyer requests a trade. The seller can only release the escrow to the buyer (presumably after the bank deposit appears online) but cannot get it back. Second, as with any other business, the tradesman's reputation is everything. If a seller has a spotless reputation after trading with several hundred different buyers, physical presence does not really change anything.
In short, if you are more comfortable meeting a seller face-to-face, I would encourage you to do so. Just keep in mind that many no longer consider physical presence necessary.

For what it's worth, I sell online with bank deposit. I used to also sell face-to-face, but discontinued the practice.
I did not stop selling face-to-face because a person might claim that I did not release the BTC. I would never release the BTC until I had the cash in my hand. (Escrow is pointless face-to-face.)
And I did not stop because I might be held up and robbed. I am a state-licensed self-defense firearms instructor (pistol) and I always go armed. 
And I did not stop because I feared counterfeit bills (which are more common that you might think). I would always meet the buyer at my bank, and let one of my bank's tellers check the bills before I would accept them and release the BTC.
I stopped selling face-to-face because it dawned on me that, if a buyer is willing to walk into a bank and let a teller handle his cash before receiving the BTC, then he may as well deposit the cash and be done with it, without our ever having to meet at all.

In 1976 i finished a contract in a South American country and wanted to take my earnings out. I did it by casting a set of wrenches in pure platinum, dirtying them with grease and soot, and throwing them in the trunk of the car. I stood patiently as border guards pushed the wrenches aside, searching for any precious metals. It worked.
Almost every country, even the United States, limits how much money you can take out. Not to put too fine a point on it, anyone who has never tried to take hard-earned money out of any nation has no clue as to the usefulness of bc.

I agree that it is sad, but only because over the past century many Western nations have invented victimless crimes: drinking, smoking, drugs, gambling, prostitution, money laundering, working on the Sabbath, etc. Any society that punishes you "for your own good", rather than to protect others, is tyranny. I am reminded of a would-be suicide in Italy a few years ago, who was ordered to back away from the bridge railing by two cops. Determined to jump, he disobeyed them. So they shot him to death.

People compare it to the tulip mania of 1637 and similar irrational bubbles. But those were frenzies over things that lacked intrinsic usefulness. The percent of tulip owners looking to make a quick buck versus those who actually used them was 100-to-0. Bitcoins have a use. The percent of bitcoin owners looking to make a quick buck versus those who actually use them is more like 80-to-20. So it will likely crash when speculators bail, but it cannot crash below its value to those who use them.

Regarding designing the site for mobile use, I think that is a fine idea.
Regarding instructions, let's take your example. I want to buy a one-ounce silver bullion round (a maple or an eagle, say). I want to offer 0.212 BTC (about $24) for the coin. I want to receive it at my home address via USPS, Fedex, or UPS. I am willing to risk 1 BTC to keep the coin-seller honest.
So now I open the offer/make page
1. What should I choose from the "category" drop-down?
2. What should I choose from the "risk type" drop-down?
3. What should I type into the "risk amount" text box?
4. What should I type into the "title" text box?
5. What should I type into the "description" text box? 
Another example: I want to sell 0.1 BTC for $11.30. I want the money deposited to my bank account. Again, answer the same 5 questions.
Keep in mind that you must decide the scope of your service. Will your site be a meet-and-greet place where buyers and sellers make initial contact and then make deals? Or are folks expected to find each other and negotiate deals on their own (via  say), and then use your site at the last minute only to consumate the deal?
If the former, you will need a chat room and a way to record reputation. If the latter, you will need to point the users to someone else's chat room and web-of-trust.

I find this hard to believe. Last week the LBC system failed to update my wallet balance after a 17 BTC deposit. Fearing a ripoff by LBC itself I loudly voiced my suspicions in every public forum I could get my hands on. LBC found and fixed (actually worked around) the intermittent failure-to-update-balance bug. No one at LBC appeared steamed. No one at LBC complained that I had gone public, No one at LBC wanted to teach me a lesson. They reacted professionally and responsibly.
In the OP's case, I have no opinion whether they made the right decision. But to claim that LBC staff wanted to punish the OP for going public is beyond belief.

Logged in with Google, paid the $0.99 "membership", and ordered 1 bitcoin, all in the same session. Got email with link to pre-loaded privkey in a couple of hours. Downloaded and immediately swept it into a working addy. The sweep is confirming even as we speak.
Very nice. Very slick. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it IMHO.
I really, really hope that BTCQuick succeeds in the face of what I anticipate will be relentless attempts to defraud and charge-back. The site reminds of the many times that we have found a wonderful new little restaurant nearby, only to see it fold in six months. I wish BTCQuick all the best, and I plan to be a regular customer.

I agree, but would add: don't keep your privkeys on any computer. Keep them someplace secret. Load a privkey into spending software only in the moment when you are going to spend it. And then immediately delete it.

They display to you (on screen) a one-time alphanumeric card code, which you copy/paste into Amazon. Amazon credits the amount to your account, and all subsequent purchases draw from that credit balance. Very slick. Very user-friendly. I see no reason why it cannot be used from anywhere.

As a professional trader who has bought and sold hundreds of BTC on LBC,
1. I agree that if the bank finds out, they will close your account, and may even seize your funds. Therefore, never keep more in any one bank than you can afford to lose and always have backup accounts in multiple banks that you can switch to in an instant. 
2. I agree that everyone should pay their fair share of taxes.

When you say, "stringing you along", do you mean before of after the trade is locked in?
If you mean before the trade is locked in, then your price will float up and down following the swings, so there is no problem.
If you mean after the trade is locked in, then the trade should expire in a few hours, so you cannot be strung along "for days", so there is no problem.
It looks like you simply want to justify to yourself not honoring your commitments. If so, go for it. But don't be surprised if customers avoid you. Your choice.

I am away from my office, so cannot give documented numbers, but I was just starting so it was less than 10k. I was inexperienced, so when the bank guy on the phone asked what I was selling I said "bitcoins".
The next time a banker (Citibank) asked me that I said "let me call you back", hung up, and immediately sucked the account dry as a roasted chilli before they could act.

I do not know who you refer to as "we". But before I retired in 1999,  I had lived and worked my entire career in a dozen different countries on five continents. "Laws" are precisely whatever those in power say they are, no more, no less. This has been true throughout history. It is true around the globe today. It is especially true in the United States today, with the so-called Patriot Act. Have you never heard of "rendition"? Have you never heard of FBI "national security letters", where it is a federal crime even to tell your lawyer that you received one?

The latest Android wallet is already very close to this. You can tell it to get the blockchain info from your own home-server bitcoind 0.8 node (either instead of, or in addition to other nodes). But it keeps key-pair management within the Android, whereas I think I would prefer to keep it on the server.

I used to sell BTC face-to-face but stopped doing so about 6 months ago. After an experience with counterfeit USD, I made my meeting-place the lobby of my credit union, where everyone knows me. I would accept the buyer'a cash and hand it to a bank teller. The bank teller verified that the cash was good, and then I immediately transferred the coins to the buyer.
Then one day it dawned on me that I did not need actually to be there. If a buyer was willing to hand his cash to a bank teller and receive his BTC instantly, and I could see the deposit on my screen as soon as the teller hit her terminal button, why bother to meet physically? The buyer can go to his nearest bank, I can sit at my office desk, and we can do the trade faster, easier, and with less driving.
From the buyer's viewpoint, it may seem safer to look someone in the eye rather than over the internet, but this is an illusion. First, with LBC the seller's coins go into escrow tagged with the buyer's userID the moment that the buyer requests a trade. The seller can only release the escrow to the buyer (presumably after the bank deposit appears online) but cannot get it back. Second, as with any other business, the tradesman's reputation is everything. If a seller has a spotless reputation after trading with several hundred different buyers, physical presence does not really change anything.
In short, if you are more comfortable meeting a seller face-to-face, I encourage you to do so. Just keep in mind that many no longer consider physical presence necessary.

1. As explained in  LBC escrow is automatic. The moment that you (the buyer) click "Send trade request", the system takes the bitcoins from us (Backintyme Publishing--the seller), and puts them into escrow tagged with your user-ID. From then on, we cannot get them back. All we can do is withhold them or release them. Sellers have no incentive to hold them after you pay.
2. As publicly displayed in  we are professional commericial traders. We have made many hundreds of trades with many hundreds of different customers. Our record and reputation is spotless. We would not jeopardize out business for a few thousand dollars. Our advice is to trade only with similarly reputable sellers.
3. Twice, we have had remorseful customers -- buyers who were unhappy when the price fell the following day. Per our policy, we offered to refund their money in return for their returning the coins. One accepted.

You're welcome, but please do not think that I would have agreed with the decision. (I did not participate, of course, since I am neither developer nor mining pool manager.) But the choice made has two drawbacks:
(1) It patched clean code (0.8) forcing it to conform to buggy code (0.7). In my experience, this is never a good idea.
(2) It burned up the stockpile of political influence held by a handful of developers. Essentially, they used their community's respect to force 0.8 miners to conform. Their influence in the next emergency will be greatly diminished as a result.
The only advantage of the solution chosen (keeping the 0.7 fork and abandoning the 0.8 fork) was that it avoided breaking 0.7's around the world, and forcing users everywhere to stop dithering and immediately upgrade to 0.8. So? Where is the downside?

Your money is not in a wallet. You money is dispersed in the cloud. A wallet is merely a handy place to store private keys. The private keys are what enable anyone to spend your money. Other than for trivial amounts, never keep your private keys in a wallet that is in someone else's hands. For serious amounts, do not even keep your private keys in a wallet on your own computer. Hide your private keys somewhere and import a private key into your wallet only in the moment when you are going to spend it. Then delete it from the computer wallet again.
Summarizing: Your money is dispersed in the cloud. It can be spent by anyone who has your private keys. A wallet is just a handy but more-or-less risky place store private keys. Better to hide seriously valuable private keys someplace else.

Assuming that you do not want to be a speculating day trader. Whenever you buy BTC with USD, withdraw the BTC to your private key-pair afterwards. Whenever you sell BTC for USD, withdraw the USD to your private bank account afterwards.

Ah, but there is. Govt can no longer deficit spend, but they can tax everyone's BTC and hand the proceeds to their banker cronies.

Do it. Remember that your wallets do not contain coins. Your coins are all in the cloud, so to speak. The wallets merely contain key-pairs that let you spend the coins. For key-pairs that you handle often (day-to-day spending) I would keep copies of the same key-pairs in blockchain.info, in at least one desktop wallet, and in at least one smartphone wallet. Thus, you can spend and receive with the very same key-pairs no matter where you are, even if blockchain.info is down.
For long-term savings, I would receive coins into key-pairs that you have written down somewhere but have never installed into any wallet (except perhaps to test). Only when you want to spend savings should you import copies of its key-pair into your day-to-day wallets.
Again, the important thing to remember is that it is wise to keep copies of the same day-to-day key-pairs in multiple wallets, both for easy access and in case you lose a wallet. The wallets hold nothing but key-pairs, not coins; the coins are in the cloud.

Yes, you are probably right. I just posted an offer using USPS. I will try direct cash deposit to Chase Bank next time.
By the way, my offer asked the buyer to send his cash first (since it takes longer) and then I send the BTC. This means he would take all the risk. Is there any provision in your system to waive his "deposit"? It seems unnecessary in this case, and not requiring it would enable newbies without any bitcoins at all to acquire their first ones.
[Later] On second thought, forget that suggestion. If one person has no destroyable stake, then he could burn my deposit after the transaction was finished, just for the sheer hell of it, and it would cost him nothing.

You can earn bitcoins in precisely the same way that you earn dollars, euros, or yen. That is, by providing a service or product that others are willing to pay for. For example, I earn money two ways: by selling scholarly books on the history of U.S. "racial" classification ( and by teaching handgun self-defense ( Both businesses accept bitcoins.

Sorry. I misunderstood.
You want clients to pay you in fiat (dollars) via a debt instrument (cheque, credit card, debit card, paypal, etc.). You then want that fiat credit automatically transformed into a BTC asset.
I know of no way to do this today. The basic problem is the transformation step, which turns a relatively high risk revocable promise into an irrevocable hard asset. I expect that such businesses will arise before long, but will be organized more like collection agencies than like banks, charging a 20-40 percent cut. People who take risks charge for it.

As 7trXMk6Z said, there is no good way to get dollars to MtGox. There are several bad ways. Until recently, I had thought that the least bad way was via bank international wire transfer. But then one of my wire transfers apparently tripped a money-laundering red flag and I had a hell of a struggle to get my money back from the feds. Now I usually hold my nose and use Dwolla. Also, some exchanges (Camp BX, Bitfloor) accept Capital One 360 (was ING) P2P transfers, and btcQuick accepts credit cards. But they have shallower markets or higher fees than MtGox.
I would love to use Tradehill if they ever restart. They are honest guys who got a royal screwing from dishonest people. Still, I expect that there will always be a problem at the interface between the banking system and bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-09 17:38:50
Talk to your local BOA branch manager. The reason bitfloor wants you to withdraw from your account to cash, then deposit the cash into bitfloor's account, is to make the deposit irrevocable. The reason the bank wants you to be physically present, rather than authorizing the withdrawal-and-deposit by phone or email, is  to demand photo-id, so that you cannot later deny that it was you who authorized it.
But if you have a good relationship with your branch manager, and they know you and trust you, they can set up an authorization password so you can launch the transaction by phone.

It was discussed. It could have gone either way. The decision was that it will be easier and faster to have all the 0.8 miners revert to a version they already had (0.7) than to try to get all to 0.7 guys to upgrade to 0.8 on an emergency basis.
Ironically, the fork was caused by a bug in 0.7, which appeared when an 0.8 miner created a valid block that 0.7 improperly choked on.
Once we are back to a single chain, plans can be made either to fix the bug in 0.7 or to set a deadline for everyone to get off 0.7.

It depends on how much you have at stake.
The private keys to your main nest-egg savings should not be loaded into any wallet anywhere, until the last minute when you must spend them. And they should never loaded into a web wallet even then.
As for as your day-to-day petit-cash wallet (&lt; 2 BTC), I agree with the Ferengi.
For micro-transactions (reddit bitbot, a website tip-jar) blockchain.info is fine.
Finally, the question of exchange accounts. It blows me away whenever I read that someone's BTC were stolen from an exchange account (mtGox, bitfloor, campbx, etc.). With one exception, there is no conceivable reason to leave BTC sitting in an exchange account. You should transfer newly purchased BTC from the exchange to your own privkey within seconds of buying them ... within seconds. Why rely on the exchange's security rather than simply take possession?
The exception is if you are a speculator, buying and selling multiple times at the same exchange on the same day. In that case, you either know what you are doing or you deserve your fate.

The challenge with any decentralized exchange lies in how to ensure fairness (stopping one person from scamming the other by agreeing to transfer value second and then reneging), and doing so without involving a TTP (trusted third party, such as escrow or arbitration).
Although research continues on staged back-and-forth signature revelation (Camacho 2012, Fair Exchange of Short Signatures without Trusted Third Party), the basic problem of exchange fairness without a TTP has been mathematically proved to be insoluble (Richard Cleve, "Limits on the security of coin flips when half the processors are faulty.", STOC, 364–369. ACM Press, November 1986).
So, it seems to me that the quest for an unscammable TTP-free exchange protocol must be abandoned. (Bitcoin implements an unscammable TTP-free one-way transfer protocol.) In this light, I suggest that researchers accept the unavoidable need for a TTP and, instead, pursue an exchange protocol that uses the existing network of Bitcoin nodes itself as the trusted third party.
For example, define a "two-way exchange" as a pair of linked one-way transfers. Consider a scheme whereby someone sets up a two-way exchange transaction (comprising a pair of linked one-way transfers) that is somehow stored in the block chain, but not fired off until both parties send in private hashes. Once both authorizations are confirmed, the network simultaneously fires off both of the component one-way transfers.
The fact that one of the transfers sends bitcoins while the other sends a non-bitcoin value (USD, gold coins, copyright permission, etc.) is a minor problem. The non-bitcoin transfer could easily send the combination to a safe-deposit box containing something physical, a bank code to a numbered fiat account, a GPG-signed contractual obligation, or the like.

I buy BTC from them with USD sent directly P2P from my Capital One 360 bank account. I have found them to be very reliable. (Much faster and more consistent than Coinbase, IMHO.)  IIRC, Bitfloor had some funds stolen last year but they have managed fully to recover. The only drawback is that they are a shallow market, so if you want to buy or sell hundreds of BTC at a crack, your offer itself will affect the price.

Something is wrong. The address linked to a privkey MUST be the same, no matter where the privkey is loaded. Check with the website bitaddress.org or with the android app “Bitcoin Address Utility” to make sure that your privkey always generates the same address that Spinner shows.

You should set up a private wallet outside of the LBC system. You can then transfer from the LBC wallet to your private wallet for free (except for the tiny miners' transfer fee). From your private wallet you can then send the coins anywhere.

The person **did not** make an offer two days ago. You made a public offer when you posted the ad. Your customer **accepted your public offer** two days ago. Honor your commitment.
Once a public offer is accepted, an ethical seller would stand by the offer that he made. To do otherwise is called "bait-and-switch". The seller in this case is unethical. The excuse that "I did not mean it." or "It was an accident." is irrelevant. Do not make public offers than you do not intend to honor.

Why was your money sitting in Mtgox for a week?
If you want to buy bitcoins, you should: (1) Transfer USD from Dwolla, (2) buy BTC, (3) send the BTC to your own keypair. (Leaving only pennies in Mtgox.)
If you want to sell bitcoins, you should: (1) send the BTC from your own keypair to Mtgox, (2) sell the BTC, (3) withdraw the USD to Dowlla. (Leaving only pennies in Mtgox.)
If you are not a speculator/day-trader, there is no reason to leave either BTC or USD sitting in an exchange, any exchange. If you are a speculator/day-trader, then you are on your own.

According to the basic introduction to LBC pricing...
With localbitcoins.com, it is really easy to create profitable and competitive pricing strategy. For example, you could use pricing strategy like this:
Selling: bitstampUSD_ask * 1.05
Buying: bitstampUSD_bid * 0.95
More complex example:
Selling equation: (mtgoxEUR_close + localbtcEUR_close + EUR_24h ) / 3 * 1.05
Selling equation  max(max(localbtcUSD, bitstampUSD), USD_24h)
Buying equation: (mtgoxUSD_low + intrsngUSD_low + USD_24h ) / 3
As parameters you can use any currency averages from bitcoincharts.com, for example USD_30d, EUR_24h, SEK_7d. Also market data can be used by combining the market like mtgoxUSD and a parameter like ask, bid, low, high and close.
I implore you, for your own reputation, to visit  before posting any more LBC ads.
In short, the price does float and is updated every hour. Once a customer accepts your offer, then the price is locked until the trade is consumated. This means that you should expire or cancel the trade if it  is not consumated within a reasonable time. When I sell, I allow three hours or the trade is cancelled. When I sell, I allow one hour.

"The wrong chain"?
The 0.8 fork had most of the hashing power, so by the founding bitcoin protocol it should have survived and the 0.7 fork should been been abandoned. Of course, such a decision would have broken thousands of copies of 0.7 around the world as they choked on the offending block, forcing their users to stop dithering and upgrade to 0.8 (cleaner, faster, less buggy) immediately.
A handful of developers made the decision to go with the 0.7 fork and patch 0.8 to protect 0.7's bug. So be it. But I cannot see calling either fork "the wrong chain".

I am not familiar with the "blockchain.info wallet". If the app lets you keep a privkey in your phone that no one else can get to, then the only risk would be losing your phone. So you should be okay if you keep only spending cash in its privkey.
@_date: 2013-07-26 19:14:17
No. But it depends...
Once you mark the deposit "payment completed" the seller cannot retrieve the coins from escrow. He may choose not to release them to you, but he cannot get them back from escrow. So the BTC are trapped in the escrow bucket until an admin is summoned to resolve the dispute.
The seller's excuse may be that the deposit never appeared in his bank account, so he thinks you are lying when you say you deposited the money.
You say you deposited the money and think the seller is lying when he says he never got it.
The admin will ask you to take a picture of your bank deposit receipt and email it to him. If you email the image, the admin will release the escrow to you, and probably wreak wrath upon the seller. If you say that you lost the bank deposit receipt, the admin will release the escrowed BTC back to the seller, and probably wreak wrath upon you.

Correct. If you buy BTC with USD at an exchange, withdraw the BTC to a private key-pair as soon as practical. If you sell BTC for USD at an exchange, withdraw the USD to a private bank account as soon as practical. Leaving either BTC or USD in an exchange is like buying jewelry at a store and then leaving your purchase and your money on the counter when you walk out. The longer you leave it, the greater the chance of loss.

You are correct in your facts, and you might be correct in your forecast. Only time will tell.
But in English, what you describe is called a "bubble", not a "scam". The word "scam" is used only when someone deliberately causes the rise and collapse. Where the rise and collapse results from free market irrational enthusiasm followed  by panic, it is called a "bubble". Look up the "tulip mania of 1637" for the most famous example.
