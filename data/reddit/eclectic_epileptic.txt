You missed the train by several years. Try localbitcoins.com and hope the sellers are not gonna uphold the law requiring them to ask for your ID.

Worthless funds you cannot access vs worthless funds you have in cold storage. What's the difference? /s

Nope. Everyone at the exchange wants to get out so they sell but when they actually want to withdraw fiat it comes to light exchange doesnt have enough money. Exchange will probably try to hush-hush this so they will "temporarily" suspend all trading and withdrawals. Thats the main reason you want to store your coins.
When the price is crashing down everywhere the worst thing you can do is trying to cash out.

If I understood correctly, your service doesnt need to actually transfer coins every time a game comes to conclusion. Do the actual transfer only when user deposits and withdraws - same as on exchange


Wouldnt that defeat the purpose of cold wallet?
