lol I was just pointing something out, doesn't have to mean I'm a professional investor.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:09:01
Log charts show percentage changes instead of absolute changes, makes more sense for prices.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:58:13
Bet it feels bad that you didn't short
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:58:24
Take another look
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:05:55
Don't have any to short
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:20:11
Well in this scenario I pointed out something that the quarterback didn't know and would have helped him out.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:54:12
Seems pretty accurate, it's not like Bitcoin hasn't crashed in the past multiple times.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:07:30
And by the time you're done learning bitcoin will be worth even less!
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:58:04
Damn that would have been a good idea
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:57:55
Well there you go
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:07:32
I'm not sure what your point is with the volume? Obviously past performance doesn't equal future results, it can be indicative of them though.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:55:52
And why is that?
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:08:34
Not really, it doesn't make sense to look at price changes is absolute terms.
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:09:17
50% certainly is
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:57:42
Yes it is pretty accurate now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:41:06
How are they wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:16:12
It's a bitcoin subreddit, not a bitcoin news subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:21:03
It was a bubble in 2013 and twice before and the price is rising in a similar way but on a larger scale.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:13:41
A parabola would have to come back down.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:39:36
What's wrong with bankers?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:06:06
Just because someone can the pay interest  on their debt doesn't mean them racking up more debt is a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:53:44
Bitcoin certainly grows in price in the long run, but it sure seems like a bubble right now. Just like 2013 and the two times it happened before that.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:03:54
True, that's more on the government than the bankers though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:28:35
That's what investing in a bubble feels like!
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:16:48
IT'S UNDER 9000!!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:29:57
Why exactly do you guys hate Roger Ver? I've listened to his interviews and he seems alright.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:34:08
You think more people are using bitcoin as a currency rather than a speculative asset?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:58:29
That's how economic bubbles tend to work.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:12:57
So are you actually twelve years old or just pretending?
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:29:40
This guy's a billionaire and you're a worthless internet troll, how does that feel?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:21:44
That's definitely not indicative of a bubble /s
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:35:44
Sell now then buy more after the next crash.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:56:26
Nah the big crashes as in $1200, $230 and $30. Obviously the price of bitcoin increases massively in the long run, but the giant spikes are always bubbles.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:52:18
Wait until it crashes then buy, no clue why somebody would buy right now if they're thinking of holding.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:28:51
So this is different than the last 3 times it was in a bubble?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:14:28
Wait for it to crash then buy, there's no reason this rally would be any different than the last three.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:48:17
Because gold isn't currently in a huge bubble and it's less volatile.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:54:59
Markets opening could make the bubble a lot bigger, don't see why that would prevent it from crashing.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:25:22
Better off buying after the next crash, sure it keeps going up in the long term, but this is clearly a short term bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:07:58
The question is how much of the network is people that want to use Bitcoin as a currency/store of value and how much is just speculative traders. Just because it's rallying in the short term doesn't mean it will keep going up at this rate.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:31:43
Is it not currently the worst time to buy Bitcoin? Or is this rally somehow immune to a crash?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:49:00
Bitcoins growing in value over time, but it's clearly in a bubble right now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:35
And now under $10,000 again
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:38:05
You'll lose money if you buy either at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:47:13
So I guess the last 3 times it crashed for real were just anomalies.
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:11:33
Just looked it up because it crossed my mind and you brought up a fair criticism. But I don't think paying for votes would really be much of an issue and it would be easy to contain.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:04:39
It's a pretty sober analysis
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:46:30
@_date: 2018-03-10 10:37:15
Both people benefit in that individual example. On a large scale governments could just make it illegal to pay for votes which would make it very difficult to buy enough votes on a large scale enough to affect the election as nobody would be able to advertise their bribery and could easily be reported.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:46:06
"Expect exponential growth for at least the next 3 years" LOL
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:45:50
Or maybe it is the bubble now
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:08:13
You have to pay miners though. If it's so efficient what's stopping a bank from setting up a system that checks transactions the same way bitcoin does but without the redundancy the blockchain requires to be reliable?
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:26:20
Or it's just another fluctuation...
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:31:37
How can Bitcoin be cheaper than banks when it requires multiple computers to check the same transaction? I don't see the average person adopting crypto unless for cost reasons.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:45:20
Why couldn't you have fractional reserve banking with bitcoin? A bank could issue 'bitcoin tokens' in agreement to be paid back in the future with interest and if the bank was established and trusted by enough people the tokens could go into circulation on the blockchain and be redeemable for real bitcoins.
