Dude, you agreed those admittedly stupid terms, so now you gotta sit it out.  
Find a BTC ATM somewhere next time. They're just about everywhere.

This is all true, however, for those who have significant money tied up in investment accounts and retirement accounts, GBTC is basically the only way to invest in BTC using those moneys.  401k's are workplace controlled.  No other options, and no, you're not holding BTC, but it's (currently) the only game in town.

This hasn't aged well, and it's only been an hour.

Oh, by all means, I am definitely DCA buying BTC as well, and happy to do it.  The lion's share of my investable cash is under a retirement plan, however, so if you know of another vehicle for institutionalized money, like 401k's and such, into BTC, please let me know. GBTC is the only method I'm aware of.  There is also a Scandinavian fund, CXBTF, that tracks BTC as well, and I have some of that too.

No one was able to watch him make his own damn coffee and buy bitcoin with the difference... so he did do it anonymously.

With the ongoing QE out of Washington DC and fast and loose taxation wealth accumulation at the top, the fiat USD doesn't have much of a future. The Euro is on the same, albeit less aggressively destructive path. At some point, price ting more Dollars won't help the situation, and will make it nearly impossible to conduct commerce using USD. 
The good news is that our mortgages will be cheaply paid off and BTC will soar to unimaginable values. The bad news is that the economy will tank and society/civilization will go down with it.  
Buy BTC. Hold it.  Make popcorn, pop a beer and watch.

The answer to this question is always YES, NOW.  There is no crystal ball, and buying years ago would be better, but today is your option.  If you believe in bitcoin, buy now, and whenever you can,  DCA more.

Your aggro BS invited me to return fire.  What, is it not as much fun when someone else is aggro back at you?
You missed the point; if you wanna go steal your university's electricity to run a miner, go ahead, get expelled and earn yourself a criminal record.  If you'd like to make a few sats where no one will both you, Honey miner is a good way to go.
I just started this yesterday evening, and sorry, but yeah, I'm up to 28 cents with my laptop and my desktop (with a GPU) both working on the same account.  And I disclosed that 10 cents of that was a starting bonus, so I've been open about it.  Not shilling, don;t give a fuck if you do it or not.  It's fun, you aren't going to get rich doing it, and you'll lose money if you buy hashrate from them.  That's it, all I was saying.
Hopefully, you're smart enough not head down the road you talked about, since it leads to you going to jail and losing pmuch everything except the title "Felon."   But maybe not, your posts seem to show you to be eager jumper to aggression and an aptitude for angry emotionalism.  Your choice, college boy.  The most cost effective way to get BTC in any real quantity is to buy it.  
Mining on Honeyminer is free, easy and you won't get in trouble for it; you just won't make much BTC. But it's free, so not sure what your expectations are.  If you spend $1k to 11k on an ASIC miner and you poach electricity in your dorm, you will be caught, expelled and prosecuted.  BTC doesn't need any more of this BS criminal mindset.

If you want to get exposure to Bitcoin in your retirement/investment accounts, put some money in GBTC.  There is a premium to it, meaning it's not 100% analogous to owning BTC, but you don't have to hold, exchange, or transmit BTC either.  It's the best way to buy BTC for your investment accounts.
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:22:06
21 CENT SHILL!  Hahahahahahaha.  And "they don't send SWAT for grow ops"...  You really *ARE* a kid, aren't you?  "redditor for 4 weeks"   Either that or you got your whiny butt kicked off too many subs so you had to start a new name.  Anyway, via con.
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:21:53
21 cents includes the bonus Honeyminer pays for all new miners.  I also have a GPU working on my desktop, so it is increased.  But "shilling" for 21 cents?  Lolz.  I bet you're also telling your significant other that 4 inches is "YUGE"....
@_date: 2019-08-19 02:33:26
The problem is that you can not remove the money from the plan.  By law, for many of us, our investments are required to be within the plan, which means we can not buy BTC with it.  I've more than tripled up my 401k in the last 6 months with GBTC.  
The only other option to invest these funds are in stocks, mutual funds and ETFs.  GBTC is an excellent option for these funds.

When BTC was $10, was $20,000 insane?  Of course it was.  Now it's a road sign on the way forward.  The world has changed greatly since BTC's inception.  It will change greatly in the next 10 years, as well.
The positive thing is that we are in position as early adopters to ride the wave... again.

This is just an advert for using their services to buy "virgin Bitcoin," which is a dubious need at best.

At the moment, BTC is a little too cumbersome to be used for daily, average microtransactions. The lightning Network promises to change that, but it's still new.  Other coins, however, have already broken the code on microtransactions, and one in particular already has a large real-human user base: Kin.
Kin is the most-used cryptocurrency in existence, when you look at actual human beings using the coin. 
Kin is mostly earned, not bought, though 70+ apps available on Android and iOS devices.  
Kin was initially an Ethereum based coin, but after the CryptoKitties meltdown, the team decided to fork a blockchain off the Stellar Lumens platform (ultra low transaction fees, super fast tx times and high tx per second numbers)
What makes it so interesting is that mass adoption of Kin is already underway, with a half million + people spending Kin monthly, 8 million unique people earning it.  It's a small but growing and vibrant ecosystem based on millions of average users earning and spending Kin in apps.
It's not a competitor to Bitcoin however, as Bitcoin is setting itself up to be a worldwide reserve currency.  The lightning network should allow for quicker, cheaper and more useful BTC transactions in the future, but remember that there really aren't any ways (many?) to *earn* Bitcoin.  You have to buy it with Fiat, for the most part.  With Kin, you can buy it with Fiat, but most users will earn it in a multitude of apps.  I HODL both.
Good luck!

Yeah, just as I figured, Kid.  You're not smart enough to 'see-and-avoid' fucking yourself over.  
Anyway, since "College Apartment" can mean a lot of things, just go ahead and run those miners 24/7 and see what happens, lol.  Worst case is SWAT busts down your door thinking you've got a grow-op and shoots you by mistake; best case scenario is you get kicked out and prosecuted.  There's no scenario where you mine your BTC and live happily every after.
Bless your heart, kid.  Good luck; you'll need it.

Never keep your BTC in an exchange.  Unless it's Mt. Gox.

If you roll into a self directed IRA, you can buy GBTC, the Greyscale Bitcoin ETF.  You won't hold actual BTC, but you won't have taxes and fees either.

While other governments are working to embrace cryptocurrencies, the US continues to view them in a negative light. Trump and his SecTreas both spoke against them recently.

Open other accounts.  Gemini is one of the best.  Do the kyc process at the cash app as well, you can use that wallet to withdraw to you bank account.  
Multiple accounts at several exchanges that allows fiat transfers will bypass Coinbase and outs limitations.

Well, since the Fed abandoned it's qualitative tightening experiment last month, I doubt we'll have long to wait and see.  The list of industrialized countries with negative bond rates is large and growing, it's well over 75% now.  Germany, England, France... we're next.  
I guess you could argue that it's all moot since we're going to war with Iran and NoKo, but whatever.  Trends and evidence are there, if anyone cares to see.  
With QE coming back online, the stock exchanges should settle down a little bit for a while, but all the while, the debt continues to grow, the Fed's asset book continues to grow, money supply continues to grow... and every indicator is pointing to some kind of recession coming in the next 3-6 months.
Now, there's an argument to be made for Bitcoin to not be a safe haven go-to for investors.  And to a point I agree... ignorant investors will most likely be BTC-averse.  But the educated ones, the ones who have a basic knowledge of BTC and it's history... now have institutional onramps through Fidelity and TDAmeritrade (or will very soon).  Van Eck has an approved BTC ETF.  BAKKT is starting up.  And of course, you always have GBTC and CXBTF as instruments to expose your portfolio to Bitcoin.
And in the 2017 run up to $20k, you didn't most of that.  In its place you had fomo and hyper-aggressive buying frenzy.
Today, we have much more than simple FOMO.  Between financial insecurity, well heeled investor flight to safe havens, industrial onramps for 401ks and other investment accounts, burgeoning use case creation... and next May, the halvening...(halfning?)
If my Aunt had balls, I'd speculate she was actually my uncle.  There is a difference between guessing and looking at trends and evidence and past historical happenings, and creating a workable hypothesis from them... and speculating.  
There's a lot happening these days.  You can ignore one or two things, but ignore them all at your peril.
