Like physically take your land, food, and natural resources I meant.

You make a good argument for bitcoin being valuable, which it is, but what is the correct market cap for it?
Also how can you be sure it won't be another cryotocurrency that reaches mainstream adoption?

German industrial power consumption is around 240TWh, ( total bitcoin power consumption is 29TWh. 
It's lower but we're not exactly talking drop in a bucket either. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:18:39
The thing is are these buyers really "users"? Who's actually using bitcoin as a currency? What if people stop buying and start selling?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:25:21
You used to be able to buy things on Steam with it
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:48:52
The question you should be asking yourself is whether you'd buy however much you own at the price it is today, not how high your profits are.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:13:41
Do you have any idea what you're talking about? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:51:58
But how do you know these problems will be solved by bitcoin? Maybe another cryotocurrency will be the one.

Are tx fees not really high right now? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:21:20
And I assume you pay no taxes in this system? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:46:45
Still if he really thought these were the only options he should've sold everything at 19k
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:24:04
I really can't, it was an honest question 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:33:49
Wouldn't it have been equally as ethical to sell a couple of months ago when the price wasn't insanely high? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:15:34
Wow man, that's completely unrelated. Just saying, high tx fees are not propaganda. Weird how tribal people are about this stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:25:12
"the middleware node performs that logic based on the signed transactions coming from the user wallet" I think the middleware node is a very big and non trivial aspect. Someone needs to run this logic and store all the data of which btc token corresponds to which bch token, and which wallets correspond to which signatures, and make sure that it doesn't go wrong. Also, you're paying bch tx fees for all of this. Also we can't get exchanges to adopt segwit, how would we go about getting them to adopt a costly middle layer both participants in a tx need to run?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:34:59
So transactions would happen on the bch chain, while the middle ware layer would assign the bch tokens to btc tokens? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:59:23
Alright, what if someone physically takes you and wants to shake you down for your bitcoin? Ultimately we need the police/army unless we somehow figure out how to make people better
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:21:40
Sorry, who owns the bch pool? And it seems to me that both your middle layers need to agree on which bch tokens correspond to which btc tokens, so this information needs to be verified between everyone right? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:57:09
So the user wallet would have to instruct the bch to update and the middle layer to update?

The opening of ETFs could be priced into the current price. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:54:35
Haha you just equated some dude selling cryptographic tokens to slavery and the holocaust 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:28:18
But isn't the movement cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology? Maybe bitcoin isn't the one. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:32:51
How did you get the CIA from those facts? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:47:28
Blockchain  technology is like UDP/tcp 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:27:20
I still don't get whose computing power is giving the reimbursements, or tracking which bch token corresponds to which btc. Also, from the users POV why not just use bch at that point? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:17:02
Why is bitcoin the Bible? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:46:07
29TWh is not a drop in the bucket, it's more than some countries entire yearly energy expenditure.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:28:13
I was curious so I actually checked, yearly power consumption for LA is 69.6TWh
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:13:43
So on my computer I have a list of which of my tokens on the bch chain corresponds to which of my tokens on the btc network. And then I want to send some btc to some third party, what do I do? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:50
So say you agree to exchange bitcoin for food. You give someone bitcoin, and they don't give you food. What do you do? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:09:17
Really? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:49:17
It's a lot less than that 
But I can't see how increasing energy usage is a good thing? The grid must be prepared for peak energy consumption so if you add in more consumption the peaks are gonna go up. Peak energy consumption is the reason why most countries can't rely on 100% renewables. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:23:29
What if a country with a centralised army decides to take all your stuff? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:40:39
Who verifies the middle layer? What if someone sells their btc without updating the middle layer? Why would people do this convoluted thing instead of using bch directly? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:26:19
How much of the hash rate is in Germany? Plus building the facilities isn't free. And Germany isn't run on 100% renewables. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:06:08
Who's running the middle layer?
