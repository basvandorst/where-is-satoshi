I have to add that the words are good because when I enter them in blockchain, it gives me my password (which I don't need because I had it already). That's all I've been able to do with the words.

Ok, I tried with the BIP 39 passphrase option, didn't work either. Sigh. Yup, we'll wait for customer support and don't worry, I will not give them the words. Thanks again for trying!

The 12 words didn't work with Jaxx or Electrum.. I know the words are right. When I enter them in Blockchain, it just gives me my password.

Thank you for your advice. I tried Coinomi, but it said that those were unrecognizable words. That is sooo weird, as they are the exact words given by blockchain.info years ago. The two of us wrote them down and we're sure about them. I guess I will have to wait to hear back from their support team. Hopefully they'll get back to me!

Ok, thank you so much! I saw that BIP 39 option in Coinomi, I will try that. I didn't know it was for the 12 words.

I tried to buy something from Canada, but they will only accept btc payments from US customers.. argh.
So, I think that whatever their numbers are, they could be much bigger if they didn't limit btc payment to the US.

Yes, indeed! Here's a tip for you :)  50 bits

Good timing for me then! :) All that aside, I'm in for the long run. I really believe in that system. It is just freaking out people who are using btc purely for speculation.

I accept bitcoins on my Etsy shop :) I make handmade dichroic glass jewelry. Please add it to your list!
