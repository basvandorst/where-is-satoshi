I was curious why the [PR]( which fixed this didn't have a description. Is this somehow related to the revelation that this bug is bigger than advertised (e.g. the goal was to provide a minimum amount of information to the public until the fix was widely distributed)? Or was it just that the dev was in a rush to get this merged? PRs with neither a description nor a link to an issue they fix seem pretty unusual.

That's a \_little\_ misleading. The US govt. regulates who can and can't be a "money transmitter". Through the choices of which companies they approve, they are making it easier for some to use the dollar and harder for others.  
No one stops Alex from using Bitcoin precisely because the govt. realizes that they can't regulate Bitcoin in the same way they do with $USD. Yes, on the surface it's just one person (or company) choosing to not service another. But in reality, nothing as big as Paypal exists in a vacuum.

30-year federal bonds are yielding just about 3%/yr. If somebody presented _you_ the option, would you take out an _unsecured_ 30 year loan at 3% interest?
I would. I could turn around and immediately purchase corporate bonds at a higher return for a pretty low-risk profit. More likely, I would put a good deal of that loan into the stock market. Over a 30 year period, the US stock market has pretty much always returned a return &gt; 3%/yr.
In a sense, you and I will pay for this debt. But what you're missing is that if you take this standpoint, you and I also receive the principle associated with this debt. Your tax bill might be $3000 cheaper this year, under the agreement that you pay $7000 thirty years from now. Keep in mind that $7000 you will owe will be closer to $4000 in real inflation-adjusted dollars. For the majority of people, taking on debt when the terms are _this good_ really is a sensible thing to do. All the people out there with home, auto, or credit card loans can take that $3000 they save in taxes and immediately apply it towards paying down the principle of those loans. e.g. if you could take out a 3% loan to pay off your 4.5% home loan, would you do it? Of course you would!
And the bonus: these loans are unsecured, _and_ the people who are on the hook for interest are also the ones in control of the money supply. There's never a risk that we won't be able to pay back the debt - the biggest risk is that the currency will become less valuable in doing so. If you're actually worried about national debt, despite the fact that the terms are _amazing_ and that the debt:gdp ratio (i.e. how heavy the burden of this debt is) is still lower than WW2-era, take the $3000 you _saved_ this year on taxes and use that to buy half a bitcoin.

I don't get it. Is it trying to say "cash above bitcoin" i.e. "cash is superior to bitcoin"?

Worth noting is that this measurement extends all the way to the time when only one person was constantly mining blocks. It would probably be different if you looked at uptime over just the last 5 years.

That's cool that you have a cute nickname for them.

You can't run a node and still be an offline store.

Bitcoin solves the double-spend problem by broadcasting every transaction to every participant. Since bits are free to copy, this allows a recipient to assert that they are the unique owner of the bitcoin being transferred (i.e. that you haven't already given the bitcoin to a different person).
If you want "offline Bitcoin", you'll need to make use of at least _some_ abstraction beyond directly exchanging bitcoin - pre-funded channels, etc. For example, lightning works when it's just you and the merchant communicating, separate from the rest of the network. You can't really get _much_ more offline than this. Whenever you transfer a token, the previous holder has to do something that prevents him from being able to use the same token in the future, and the recipient has to do something to verify the validity of the token.
Lightning transactions require bidirectional communication, but you could conceivably have a simpler pre-funded channel implementation that allows for the recipient to not have to communicate back to the sender. Then you could transfer funds off the network and also non-interactively (e.g. by mail) - but you wouldn't be able to do anything with these funds until you redeemed them on the network first, otherwise you're confronted with the double-spend problem again. You can't have something akin to paper money - in which you can transfer funds to _anyone_ without having to notify _all_ of the people to which those funds could have otherwise been given to - without sacrificing the security ideas that make bitcoin useful to begin with.

The PDF suggests the cost of mining with this system will predominantly be up-front costs, with energy costs after the initial purchase being negligible. My intuition on this is mixed. If someone were to own 45% of the hash power right now, they could attempt an attack at the cost of (1) opportunity cost of mining bitcoin on a fork that the network doesn't recognize, if the attack fails and (2) high real-world losses from paying for energy. If the global consensus system as a whole is using less energy, then performing an attack in this new system is almost all opportunity cost, with low real losses. One could claim that the higher up-front cost to achieve majority mining power makes these equivalent, but I'm not certain about the reality of this - especially given "hashpower for rent" services.
Also, how does this eliminate the advantage of well-funded manufacturers like Bitmain? Optical chips are new and presumably require _much_ more capital for R&amp;D than traditional ASICs. Furthermore, the performance of electronic computing has begun to level off, which should in theory make it easier to commoditize. Optical computing is newer/less mature, so I would expect it's closer to the beginning of the exponential curve electronic computing saw. If so, only having access to tech that's 1-2 years from the bleeding edge would make competition impossible, so only those manufacturers with well-funded R&amp;D depts could participate.
That being said, if optical computing is capable of providing cheaper SHAs, then the outcome seems to have already been decided.
I'd like to see some analysis on which properties an ideal PoW system should have, though.

That's an interesting stance given that government has actively _fought_ similar worldwide cryptosystems in the past. If Bitcoin had been created and shared outside the US a decade earlier, its creator would have been charged with "exporting munitions without a license". [That's what they did with PGP](

Those regulations would have applied to Bitcoin had it been developed in that time period - any software that used cryptography with &gt; 40 bits of security wasn't exportable. So are you of the opinion that Bitcoin should never have left the country it was developed in? Or that if Bitcoin had been around in the '90s, it should have only been allowed out of the country _after_ 2000?
