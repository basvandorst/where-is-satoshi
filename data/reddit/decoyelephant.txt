Okay, I'm one of these people that have started to Google bitcoin as of three days ago...I saw the graph and instantly went, "nope". But what you are trying to tell me is: The price is going to drop as more people make bitcoin, then we hit the 21 mil mark, and it will go up again? 
I *want* bitcoins. Bit I'm not going to touch them till I see that chart level, why buy something that will wither?

When I think of what "typical" bitcoin "users" are like, your personality is what comes to mind! The space Bitcoin has found itself in is unlike anything I have seen before, but if you gave me a thousand bitcoins I would scratch my head and wonder how I would possibly use them to feed myself! 
I don't encounter enough bitcoin merchants for me to get my head around the idea that it is money, and that I can use it. I want to use it, I just don't see it being more valuable than my money now...

Hello newcomers! 
*Hindsight is 20/20
Sure - you *could* have bought bitcoin at $10 a coin, but the farther back you go the odds of you forgetting/losing that bitcoin also increase. There were a LOT of ways to lose those funds. Consider what happened to the stoneman as an example. 
Don't worry about "missing out". 
Spend time learning about software/desktop wallets. You'll want to move your coins out of a exchange ASAP when you start to understand things better. Most of the hardware wallets are sold out, but you might want to put in an order for one eventually. 
 - is a popular one.

@_date: 2017-08-17 22:31:01
I really didn't realize how much I was "throwing away" for the fees. Lightning helps bridge the "fee gap".
Bitcoin gets a lot stronger when you keep the fees out of the equation, widening the gap between it and the banks that take our money for hardly any good reason!

This is such a good analogy. 
I was thinking about this while I was learning about wallets and I remembered something I saw on Antiques Roadshow. 
Someone's Grandfather used a vest to hide gold coins under his clothes while he traveled through the west. Each coin was in an individual pocket so they wouldn't make any noise. Fearing that the "clink" would give him away. 
Really feels like the "Wild West" of money.

I'm getting a feeling...
If the next generation of phones have built in support for crypto...I'll have big big regrets about now buying even more then I am now.
I work for a tech company that functions more as a technology investment firm then anything, and we have a whole department working on hyper-ledger right now.I get that same "Maybe I'm delusional" feeling - but quite honestly:
1. Cash isn't smart enough to do what we needed it to do in the past.I still remember the commercials that came out that made fun of people stopping to pay with cash at the checkout. In the future they'll make fun of people who still stop to use cards. 
1.5  Not only are we developing better things, were also still improving those systems. Its growing. If 'Bitcoin' stopped at bitcoin, I'd be dubious too. But now we have lightning, tomorrow well have something else. It will adapt to our needs.
2.  People are starting to see how restrictive the transfer system can be. We've had a couple of good examples.A) The infamous Wikileaks PayPal donation cutoff.B) Jordan Peterson donation cutoff.C) Issues with transfers for amateur sex workers on Tumblr.D) Article 13.The issue is gaining ever more visibility for the general public.  Leading me to number three.
3) This maintains the balance of power to keep a toleration government at bay. This is a natural historical progression.So yeah, I'm just gonna keep buying this S\*(@ up.

@_date: 2017-09-02 19:36:18
I'm kinda stuck thinking about all the systems that are currently in place to lead completely "legal" cash into the hands of people who shouldn't be getting it. Here in the US we have a problem with bills  being "cat - eared" where to pass one law you also pass 20 smaller laws because they have been sneaked in. 
In a fictional scenario, lets say one of these allows for a "park" to be built and be given outrageous funding of 1MIL USD. Then the "company" that had ties to the politician builds a mile long concrete walking path and calls it a "park". 
Its not the best example, but there are TONS of ways to get "legal" money into the hands of these people and then the centralized bank can HODL the papertrail and no one ever knows. 
I'm sure the last thing these people would want is another currency when they already have one they can perfectly manipulate.

If I waited to try and cut myself a bargain then I never would have bought in. I can't even remember the actual number I bought in at. I just know its up A LOT!

Agreed. I get that some people on the sub want to maximize Bitcoin's economic and investment potential - but it'll grow on its own. 
We need a better store of value, we need a better transfer of funds. We need to combine 'money' with 'currency'. 
We do not need "Cryptopal". 
We should worry about Miners teaming up with other powers to cartel bitcoin away from us.

Remember that story of how a couple who bought a home - cash - were being sued by a bank who claimed they owned a loan? When it was actually a typo.  
Crypto is backed by time - data - heat - electricity and is VERIFIABLE via the blockchain. 
Imagine how much easier it would be to settle that court case if you could just show the judge the address &amp; payment.

This depends on how much money you have. 
You have a few decent options. 
1. Choose a hardware wallet. You'll love one. My friends have them and looking at it it honestly seems like a really easy solution. 
2. Find a old computer, wipe it clean, make sure it is not connected to the internet. Airplane mode, don't set up a network, whatever. You can then create an offline wallet with the Electrum wallet. A few youtube videos will tell you how it works. Try it out and buy a steam game or something till you feel comfortable, if you can. 
3. Paper wallet! Bread Wallet! Very secure. 
No matter what you choose, its going to feel risky until you get the hang of moving them around. I really suggest sending a small, small sum back and forward to verify your addressees. Until you get comfortable :) 
There is one I didn't mention, and that is using a old, offline, mobile phone to hold your coins. I know a lot of people do this, but I don't have any experience with it, and I don't trust that phones are really a good choice . . .

Well, when to buy is something that you can figure out later. But I would suggest getting started by buying a Ledger/Trezor. Maybe two of them, or one of each.

I don't think people realize how much they have to ask permission when it comes to their financial activities. 
Go to music venue, need cash so I use the ATM at the bar. $20 withdraw costs me $23.50 Because of ATM fees. 
- Expense is recorded by my bank. 
Open a Tab at the bar - Physical card is taken from me because I trust the people working there to be honest.
- Expense is recorded by my bank. 
So here are two examples of Fees coming for the Permission to use my money, and the TRUST that is required for me to use it conveniently. 
Yeah, there are ways around it, and to be "smarter with my money", but these are flaws in a aging system that should have been improved on long, long ago. 
Now if Bitcoin was accepted at this venue, I wouldn't even NEED the cash, and I could pay for each drink with a quick QR code scan that could notify the staff that I've ordered, and what I want. I could order before I even reached the bar.

Hello, first time Bitcoin buyer here. I just bought some bitcoin, and I have conflicting times it will arrive in my "wallet". It looks like I might have 72 hours between the 29th, and the 1st to move my bitcoins...
But now I'm very paranoid that I was just robbed because of the delay on my coins hitting my wallet?
Very concerned. I will definitely be swapping my coins over ASAP.
