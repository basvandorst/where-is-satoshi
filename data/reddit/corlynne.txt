After surveying 1,000 adults in the United States, 88 percent of millennials felt that crypto is a good investment and wanted to purchase it for that reason. 42 percent indicated wanting to use crypto for savings. When asked about the applications of blockchain technology that are most relevant, 75 percent of millennials selected banking and finance.

The extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies can make even the most experienced of investors break out in a cold sweat. Digital assets like Bitcoin are inherently unreliable – especially as a currency for goods and services. This is where stablecoins come into play, but even they aren’t without their flaws. It’s a conundrum that startups like Element Zero Network hope to resolve.
[Element Zero]( uses a proprietary Algorithmic Stability Protocol that protects the stablecoin from any future volatility events, and keeps its purchasing power in place by overcoming inflation. It isn’t tied to any fiat currency, gold or other traditional methods of valuation.
Whether or not companies and governments take up Element Zero’s offer of a next generation stablecoin remains to be seen. It’s clear, however, that the market is in need of a stablecoin that is actually stable – one that can withstand whatever the economy has in store for us.
