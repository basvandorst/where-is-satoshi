Oh jesus. 99% are trading it for gains. Not buying groceries or paying rent. Mofo needs to pay tax like every other asshole making money on trading.

Jesus christ. Welcome to the religion of cryptocurrency.

Im more worried about having an earth to live on than bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:52:31
Exactly. Climate change and renewable green energy sources are most critical at the moment in my opinion, including fresh water sources. Mining bitcoin is a real problem.

I would say Buffet is amazing at investing and understanding business in general. I however, don't think he's very "aware" on technology and trends in itself.

No, not really. Regardless if the banks are shady as hell, your money in the U.S is backed by the government. Crypto has absolutely nothing like that yet. The problem with this is the term investing. With a heavily volatile market with nearly non-existent regulation, this is gambling. I'm fine with it personally. I have money in Crypto as well, but it's not borrowed and it's not from my savings. I think Crypto is where it's headed, but nobody should be gambling OR investing without at least having a savings with 6 months living expenses and minimal credit card debt.

Its a citing circle jerk?

Why would you put bitcoin above vaccinations? Also stop using bitcoin. Blockchain is the real innovation.

Ya the world has. The internet.

Self driving cars are predicted to increase effeciency across so many areas. Less deaths is awesome. Global warming... notnsure how bitcoin is helping the enviornment. Actually causing issues with the mining.

Crypto is still new and not mainstream. It really hasnt been tested through the mainstream. Its like a game company beta testing with 50k users and everything works well, but then all kinds shot starts popping up when its 90 million using it. Developers are clever and if its on a public network ot will never be 100% bullet proof.
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:46:27
My point is, only time will tell. So wait.

This is where quantum computing may help issues in the future. Its just not its time quite yet.
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:29:36
You wonder why its not catching on quicker when the world got the first glimpse of 20k straight to 3k. Ya thats fucking suspicious for your avg human who isnt a software developer or financier.

Bitcoin only exists as code in an abstract network. A combustion engine, even if the world lost our electrical grids, can keep humans alive and less miserable. Even manufacturing in the 1900 was more important. Those technologies basically brought goods and comfort to the majority of people. Really only time in 50 years will determine the exact impact. Saying its bigger right now is a joke. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:39:13
I think they are trying to point out that Bitcoin has the potential to be worth massive amounts in the future like Apple?
Trying to say it's still early to get into Bitcoin and it will grow like Apple did?
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:36:02
Tjos is how i see. Bitcoin? Ok that could be cool in 15 years. But the blockchain could house medical records, dmv records, realestate deeds, contracts,  copy right for art work. Thats the stuff that will be very useful in the next 20 years.

If someone has an income, has started a 401k of some sorts, has 6 months living expenses saved, and no credit card debt, I say go hogwild in Crypto. Financial discipline should be earned first in my opinion, before you start gambling.
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:56:36
If you want to invest in and use it "right now". That's such a huge barrier to entry for the average consumer you've already shown why it's not mainstream or even close.
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:52:33
It really hasn't changed shit about my views. I understand why blockchain is valuable and I look forward to see it in practical applications.
Right now though, with the debt I have and dealing with relationships and career, cryptocurrency has done nothing for me. It's currently an investment opportunity that I hope does well in the next 5 years to 10 years.

Advantage in what and how? Crypto isn't going to be used as an everyday transaction until all the technology behind it is so hidden that the average joe doesn't even need to think about it to use it, similar to the way cash is moved behind the scenes.
