That is true, but when they stopped txs it went down, they started back up and it went back up.  Sure the real cause is because they don’t use SegWit or batch transactions. But it seems safe to me to assume that was the cause.
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:25:30
Just use custom fees. And send your coins to a SegWit wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:19:18
Now that is pretty cool
Also, jimmy seems nice.
What’s the point of having those checkboxes if you’re just gonna click them all?
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:31:19
Yes it’s getting pretty ridiculous. BitPay is really falling behind with this. I use iOS and moved my coins to bitWallet with 176/sat per byte
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:43:12
Too many cars on the road. 1 person per car. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:55:30
You’re right. I just transferred my coins to a SegWit address for a nominal fee of 510 sat/byte. When txs with half the fee are being confirmed. It’s worth it to get it off that wonderful app. I should learn how to make apps

@_date: 2018-01-13 15:51:20
You are paying way too much for fees. Set your own fees and stop paying too much
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:57:29
Have you read the white paper? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:44:43
Get the transaction hash (ID) and you can try and push it through again
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:31:01
What’s happening to bitpay cards??
I haven’t received anything 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:08:18
I don’t think that applies here. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:04:12
I’m sure it’s not as easy as creating an app. Legal experts and all that
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:32:34
Ballsack tat
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:06:19
You aren’t wrong
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:44:09
At this point it almost seems worth it 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:42:37
Quality shit

Yes you need to wait for it to sync before you can move the funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:32:48
The network is really congested right now. Lots of unconfirmed TX. best bet is to wait for this to clear up and the fees will be lower
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:01:21
Yes I prefer Nvidia for gaming. AMD is good too though. Yes the ryzen is a good one. Look up hash rates for the processors you’ll be getting to get an idea of how much hashpower you’ll have 
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:21:48
I upvoted you but it was upside down 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:24:49
No personal info at all. Simply download and backup your wallet
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:05:47
[yes]( 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:00:31
You lock in the value you buy now at
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:39:24
Make sure you back up your wallet with the 12 word seed. That seed is your key to bitcoin. Another thing.. right now the fees are really high due to over 100k unconfirmed TXs. Don’t move the coins. You’ll get torn apart by fees. Just be smart. Go through all the settings in the app to get familiar with how it works. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:22:08
I use BitPay. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:10:48
It depends. Where did you send it from?  All the TXs are going to take a while due to the huge influx of TXs today. Wait for the mempool to come down. As soon as the transaction is going , BITPAY will let you know.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:11:36
The big one is the 21 million coin cap. That alone ensures bitcoin will always be valued

It is Wednesday my dudes.

[coinbase server status](  looks like they are having some problems with BTC and ETH. I have a pending transaction waiting.... over an hour
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:17:57
Don’t try. You’ll regret it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:05:03
There’s a guy who made a Tesla Model S into a mining rig. He uses the power from the super chargers... Might as well get some solar panels at that point. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:15:04
No it’s fine I started on coinbase as well. It’s super easy to use and works well. It’s just their servers have been overloaded today I guess with all this price rising stuff. I had to wait like 4 hours for a tx that would usually take 30 mins. Hang in there. That’s why blockchain tech is so great. You’ll get your coins for sure. And once you have them on BITPAY they’ll really be YOUR coins
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:29:41
It should  go through when the network catches up. It’s been very congested 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:51:43
Right now the lowest I can choose on BITPAY is 135s/byte
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:55:20
Mobile mining is just a waste of energy at this point. You’d just drain your battery for 15 or 20 cents a day. If that. Wait until you get a PC. A high end pc can mine around 4 to 5 dollars a day. But you have to account for the electricity used.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:45:51
The fees are based on the current network capacity. If you go to settings in BITPAY. You can choose PRIORITY, normal or economy. Check out [this site]( When the mempool is full, the tx fees are higher
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:47
Good idea. Do your research when making a paper wallet. Once you get it, it’s pretty simple. Keep backups, too. Just Incase. BITPAY gives you a 12 word seed to recover your funds.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:27:54
You are trying to download the ENTIRE Blockchain. Try a different wallet like BitPay or Blockchain.info. Much less hassle. Unless you want to have a copy the blockchain 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:37:07
GODSPEED 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:49
Go to insight.bitpay.com and paste your receive address. Coinbase is under heavy load right now. A tx that usually takes me 20 mins took 3 hours. Be patient 
[COINBASE SERVERS]( 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:50:53
It depends on what I’m doing with the coins. If I’m just transferring them to another wallet of mine I can wait 4 hours for confirmation. But if I’m sending a friend some coin, I’ll do normal. Usually confirms within 30 mins on a good day
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:20
Probably GDAX. GDAX is Coinbase. You can link your coinbase to GDAX 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:54:27
Where did you send it from?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:46:25
Need more information. Do you have the TX ID?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:11:01
I use BITPAY and keep the 12 word seed written down
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:58:10
AMD gpus are better for mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:55:30
This is all the more reason we should be moving to solar and wind power. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:50:12
	108.382 sat/B is a bit on the low side but not insane low. There are lots of unconfirmed transactions at the moment. It will go through.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:36
It’s normal. You are your own bank now. You hold the coins. Just do what works for you  
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:49:59
Look ahead in to the future. The end-game for bitcoin is much more than just buying a coffee
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:07:37
It will most likely reverse the transaction 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:22:24
That is true. Look up making a paper wallet. On a clean PC and OFFLINE 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:59:29
Just give it time. If it’s not in there by tomorrow I would contact coinbase support. I bet it will confirm sometime tonight. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:35:45
Yeah. I tried to send a friend 10 dollars and the fee was literally 4 dollars these miners are banking right now lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:03:49
The fees are high because of the backlog of transactions. Once that goes down, so will the fees. It will go through 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:25:43
[COINBASE SERVERS]( 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:15:07
I don’t expect anyone to remember 24 word seeds but if you can, go for it. Write it down somewhere and on something secure. And yes never hurts to have backups just Incase. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:29:45
At that point you would be better off using BITPAY. You control the private keys and the coins. Since you can’t really buy without an ID on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:35:48
Read everything you can. Learn about the technology. The more you know about it, the more confident you will be about Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:11:32
THIS. Your seed is really the key to your coins. SECURE THE SEED
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:10:06
