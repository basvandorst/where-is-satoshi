Don't be like that one guy that made the first bitcoin transaction to buy pizza and now could've been a millionaire. Better for your wallet and your health.

When trading on Coinbase, you don't pop the bitcoin bubble. The bitcoin bubble pops you.

Bravo sir! You have timed it perfectly!

I wish I could have bought in on this dip but I knew by the time my USD transfer went through, the price would be back up :(

Wait really? If I'm in the lowest bracket I don't pay tax on capital gains?

I'm sorry for your loss, friend.

Hopefully, you didn't sell all of your bitcoin for that Rolex. It's to the moon from here! I personally wouldn't have sold it but it's your money man! Congrats on the success.

I personally use GDAX for my bitcoin trades. You can pay with a debit card on GDAX, however, this is very expensive in fees. You can link your bank account to it which takes a few days to verify, but the fees are much lower doing it this way. To trade with the bitcoin you already have, you can just transfer them to your GDAX account. GDAX also trades Etherium and Litecoin. For other coins, I use Poloniex to trade.

Dang man, that's a real bummer! There are always nasty thieves out there that can't earn their own money so they steal it from hard working people like us. Don't let this discourage you from getting into crypto! It's so much fun and exciting and there is so much money to be made from it. I use the real GDAX website for my bitcoin trades and works great for me. Just click the right link this time ;)

Well said

So could I potentially buy lower on one exchange, transfer it to another and sell it for a higher price?
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:08:48
This was beautiful my friend

No wonder it's taking so long to get my account verified.

I know that on August first, if the majority approves segwit, then it will go into place. but if it doesn't get approved then there will be a hard fork and we will then have two separate coins.

Coinbase my friend
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:05:10
Yeah, I do use GDAX. And I don't want to pay the fees for a wire transfer.
