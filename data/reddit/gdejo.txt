As I am still a skeptic on this topic in general, how do you explain the ever growing number of crypto currency?
If someone can litteraly just make up their own currency then wtf? How do any of them have value? If one person gets to own too much of one then technically everyone else can just switch and devalue the prior. Everyone wants to bash fiat currency but at least it is managed and overseen by law makers for the most part. 
What gives bitcoin value above other currencies? Faith at this level seems to be stretched thin! And btw, the USD is not fiat, oil is traded in $ and in addition anyone who threatens this system is disposed of by the largest military our civilization has yet produced.

Yes, and it does not need a digital wallet from what I've heard. You store it securely on UrRectum, only downside is you have to unzip for every deposit.

guess it just depends on which one you use but still seems kinda high though. I wish you the best of luck my friend, rough two days.

I hate to admit it but I love reading all the stories of people getting fu*ked with their accounts and out of their money but still being hardcore BitCoin fanboys. I mean it is freaking cult like behavior, you have people going against their own self interests for the sake of the "future of the market". It is not a currency when you are forced to go to an exchange that is unregulated, shady, and killing you in fees in order to exchange it for real currency. 
I am curious to see how long before I get banned from this circlejerk....

I watched a guy on youtube try to buy an entire bitcoin on one of those ATMs and it would cost like 6-7K in fees! WTF

Guys, I forget what it was called but there is a coin that works off the block chain but can also be stored and transferred directly via NFC on mobile devices in a peer to peer kinda deal in person. What is the name? Does anyone know?
