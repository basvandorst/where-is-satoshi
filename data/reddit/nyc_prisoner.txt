I havent been visiting the bitcoin subreddit often lately and just decided to check up.  
Has there already been reports of people receiving these pouring into the subreddit lately?  or is this new article basically the press release for this new initiative and op happened to get a letter before what i assume is a large number of people based on the effort they put into creating this. 
Hate to break it to yall but there is no individual source that they are pulling from.  I've been around since 2012 and back then nobody reported shit.  The fbi and cia were the first 3 later agency really ticked off by bitcoin, so they approached it from the best angle they could given the situation:  plant bugs on every company operating an entry/exit point into the system.  I back this up with the following claims:
We have seen so much pressure be put upon exchanges in every country all over the world have a slowly tightening noose around their neck in regards to whether or not they collect KYC.  In the USA?  HA! Unless you're connected as hell, good luck establishing an exchange that handles customers of ANY volume without a pretty thorough colonoscopy level of proof \^1.  In countries that have easy extradition to the USA (europe for example) you have similar pressure but with the benefit that your advisary isnt living in your back yard.  
But why did many face issues running an all crypto exchange out of the shadiest parts of the world that have been running the underground money transfer businesses for shady gambling sites with very few issues for over a decade prior to bitcoin?  It takes a lot of political resources to enforce something on a country of which you dont have much of a relationship with, so it better be worth doing if youre going to expend that amount of resource. 
What i'm trying to say is that there is targeted LE attention on the entire industry because, lets be fair, theres a lot of criminal activity involving bitcoins (and keep in mind what the government thinks is criminal), and that it's likely they put a lot of resources in surveilling in the entrypoints and exitpoints for the average person into the bitcoin economy as an attempt to be a step ahead of criminals.
This put the IRS in a situation where, given the last bubble's effect on how interested they became in crypto (+ regulatory advances), they could very transparently use their relationships with the crypto exchanges (which is likely on the level with other surveillance infrastructure at this point--i doubt after an agent requests the name of an individual with x deposit address, most exchanges would return the result with 0 warrents, requirement of due cause, or even a human to green light the inquiry. Its automated and there are companies that are able to guess at the total holdings of a user based on his deposit sources.  
And keep in mind that the exchanges dont have much room to complain because they could be shut down quicker than you could tell them how glad you are that Ayn Rand changed your life.  The IRS is simply doing it's governmental duties  (every exchange says its gonna report shit to the government)  to perform the government appointed task of tax collecting using the infrastructure gladly passed over from the FBI/CIA who created the means to slurp all relevant data in secrecy and with the threat of force. 
**Threat of force** \-- Poloniex was universally the most used and trusted bitcoin &lt;-&gt; altcoin exchange back in the 2014-2015 era.  They were making approx. 1 metric fuckton of money and as far as i remember, they didn't have any actual usd pairs and simply offered USDT.  I am a non-criminal with evidence of the sources of my bitcoin holdings and have nothing bad on my record. Poloniex made the (surprising to most users) that your funds cannot be withdrawn until you send them an ID, a Passport, your planet fitness membership, etc... 
Users were furious because had this been communicated beforehand most of us wouldn't have traded there.  Ask yourself: *why would poloniex do this?  They had so much fucking money coming their way*
lets explore the reasons
1. They decided to scam all the criminals/people unable to provide kyc/dead peoples accounts.  It would be interesting to hear where all the funds of the users who didn't, for one reason or another, provide kyc docs.   
(many people just said screw it and took the couple hundred, possibly thousands, dollar loss because poloniex had 1 month support times during this time)  **I REPEAT, LETS HEAR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FUNDS IN POLONIEX ACCOUNTS THAT HAD FUNDS BUT WERE LOCKED OUT DUE TO LACK OF KYC? I believe they have a twitter**
2. They wanted to go the cautious route with plans of intentionally dealing with highly vetted individuals for the purpose of avoiding any of the regulatory backlash. (Very plausible, but the way in which it was done wasn't unique to them at the time, and i think most people in the know believe that they werent doing this without pressure from some direction)
3. They are dumby dumb heads who do dumb things because theyre dumby dumb dumb dumb heads. (very unlikely)
4. Or maybe the margin trading aspect put particular complications on the legality situation.
5. 9/11...?
Kind of a poorly structured rant with little but historical retellings but i think theres a point some nerd journalist could write a nice piece on about the topic of what changed in terms of regulatory commitments around the world from 2013-2017 for bitcoin exchanges and how much of it was the governments doing.

many things were simplified for the sake of simplicity.  i know theres more to a transaction that utxo-txid outputindex and send to address.  I'm happy to give more thorough answers to questions tomorrow in reply to comments i just didnt want to bloat the original post any more than my autism already did.

I cant imagine another reason.  The only possible business reason would be something like "it costs x to deal with disputes with IRL tx's than online ones so lets chop this arm off this business" but that site is the most sitback and enjoy the money since the silk road.

The BTC to XMR exchange has completed on simpleswap.io!
@_date: 2019-12-30 08:51:20
EDIT: take a look at [forkdrop.io]( list of exchanges without kyc under the exchanges tab then click no kyc
the top 10 listed are exrates Okex Crex24 Stex tradesatoshi forkonex yobit digifinex aex easyrabbit BUT this list could be outdated (and also tailored towards trading forked bitcoin chains, which is the purpose of the site during that era of "Bitcoin \[precious metal\]" right after bitcoin cash appeared in aug 2017
I use kucoin bibox bitforex without any issues, even in new york city.
Go to [protonmail.com]( make an account, get a vpn if possible (dont use tor), even more preferable is an RDP like from [rdp.sh]( for less than 20$ as this gives you a new ip that isnt bogged down by the likely malicious tarnish on the popular vpn's ip addresses.  however i have used Private Internet Access VPN without issue. (basically a remote desktop you can login to similar to teamviewer but its much more usable as a computer.) Make sure the coin you're looking for has reasonably tolerable order book depth so you dont double the price by buying 50$ worth of a coin.
I just looked and the order books for the xmr/btc pair are fine on kucoin, (not sure how much you're buying but you might lose a couple cents due to slippage on kucoin which is tolerable.) . However the xmr/eth pair is pretty thin.
Hope this helps!  Once you finished you conversion withdraw the xmr and you now have coins that are (in terms of blockchain analytics and exchange LEO intervention) there is virtually no info they can gather on your activity.
Most of the instant/nosignup exchanges like the old shapeshift (both changelly and shapeshift now require an account, not sure if kyc is required tho) exclude privacy coins if they dont have kyc.
*I'm currently waiting on simpleswap dot io btc&gt;xmr and the deposit has been recognized as pending and I'm waiting for confirmations now.  based on the lack of many complains against the site (other than typical noob whining) this site seems legitimate but like i said always go small at first.*
**CAREFUL WITH BINANCE** . i  have used binance accounts but everyone in a while they will get flagged somehow and require me to submit verification.  this usually happens after i withdrew e.g. 0.2 btc 3 times over the course of an hour then when i go to withdraw the crumbs left over, usually between 0.01-0.02, i get an email asking for ssn/dickpics etc from binance.  strange.  its happened i think 3 times and all 3 have ended up in a locked up amount between 0.01 and 0.02 and were right after substantially larger withdrawals.
(always test it in amounts you can handle losing.  that way they cant take your entire deposit and keep it hostage.
always test with a very small (&lt;$25) deposit then withdrawal too.  you never know when the deposit address fucks up or something. i lost a bunch of clamcoins because cryptopia never ended up fixing their wallet and this deposit happened months before they get rekt
EDIT: Just read that you're dealing with mostly shitcoins.  go on coin market cap, search the coin, and see what exchanges are available.  ill put this at the top of the post but i just found [ which, under the exchanges section, differentiates the kyc vs non kyc exchanges.

did exactly this.  was making them thousands a month in their 1% fee and had a useful 5 year reputation 100% in an industry with so much sketchyness.  I rejected suspected drug buyers (you can tell, if they have their friend telegram them the address over the phone, needing an exact amount NOW, etc..) and reported every dollar i made through this business to the IRS.  I didn't handle extreme amounts and i was simply helping people get bitcoin without getting robbed in the bronx for their laptop at gunpoint.  
Real life exchange of value without a 3rd party involved is essential to living life as a human.  If they really are proponents of bitcoin, why would they kick out the bottom piece of the Jenga tower.  
They didnt end OTC trading, they just ruined the most known means of dealing with matters related to reputation.  We obviously will build up again, but there has to be a reason why they shut this down and i would have to believe its related to the drug transactions on it.
A sad day.  RIP my business that perfectly satisfies the buyer and seller.  I made money they got this weirdly hard to get asset.

believe it or not, i found it extremely difficult to move my bitcoins into fiat during the period after bitlicense until the last big bubble.  i dont have a credit history, never had a credit card before so i dont work with that automatic verification places like coinbase do.  i have a different state than ny for a license with my parents address because i got this years ago, and i dont have utility bills as it was all inclusive.  it was difficult for me to verify on any big sites and smaller sites would laugh at the mismatch of id to no credit history etc...
I ended up trying to use the very few btc-&gt;fiat in nyc.  i remember btm and bitaccess.  my complaints are
* no way to know if the shitty bodega its in still is in business
* no way to know if the machine even has any cash in it (ive never had the coinatmradar thing work)
* One time i needed rent really bad so i ran down with the only 700$ bitcoin i had on my phone and right after it received the transaction, and a confirmation, i got a message to type in my ssn and after that it said that i need to manually verify with support
* I got in a huge fight with the guy on reddit lol.  id recognize his name if i saw it.  sorry about that angry phone call brother 
I felt like i had to beg people to rip me off with 10% fees.  nowadays its been great tho :)

true, but even then there are wallets that differ from the normal bip32/39/44 standards.  but you were not wrong to assume that, my bad.  
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:33:28
thats not true.  first off i dont know which currency this actually is, i dont know what the derivation path is (many use different ones), along with many other variables.  i was just wondering if anyone recognized the layout
