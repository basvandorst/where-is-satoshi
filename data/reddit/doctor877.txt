You dont really get it?

How the fuck is that good news when the business bank accounts will get blacklisted by banks like what happened in BTCChina.
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:29:21
Got some very valid points and for 99% knows more about the situation than me or you.
@_date: 2014-01-12 11:46:59
So why did other exchanges business bankaccounts get blacklisted. :D
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:26:47
Can you please explain to me why BTCChina then was dropped the ability by depositing funds via bank transfers?
@_date: 2014-01-12 11:59:30
By using personal bankaccounts, they were able to go around the regulations, now they just stepped out of the grey zone to the black one.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:15:33
So BTCChina is fucked all over again, now if Huobi's deposits get   targeted its GG for china.
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:47:05
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:38:32
Yeah, this is what I'm still not getting so far.
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:35:49
So how do you confirm, that the bitcoin seller has/hasnt received the fiat? Or explain me what I'm missing here. :D
@_date: 2014-09-26 22:15:44

Been waiting for china crash for a while, because felt it was coming after the last regulation shit happened. Now I can safely invest again tomorrow or the day after.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:39:51
I read somewhere that there was going to be some meeting between btc exchange people and gov at 29 dec. Can someone shred more light to the case?
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:40:38
Didnt bobby lee actually confirm that businesses cant use bitcoin asa payment method like a coulpe of a days ago?
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:43:28
So that doesnt seem all that bad.


If thats what they are really doing, I actually this is a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:59:12


Yea the 1b$ is ~10% of current marketcap, but when they start buying, and people see wall street is on it, the selling of coins will decrease like shit -&gt; price will rocket.
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:56:36
Has he said anywhere that which 3 altcoins has he invested in?
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:07:48
As I miserabely tried to say. :3
@_date: 2013-12-13 12:04:00
pls explain?
@_date: 2013-12-13 11:53:50
So if I'm using cryptsy, when i want to withdraw funds from there, they send a link to my email, which I need to click in order to withdraw funds. If i use diffrent password to email and cryptsy, how does this differ from  2FA?
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:51:33
Well when the offical report comes, where they tell that it is illegal to sell products for bitcoin you can guess what it will do to the price shortterm.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:15:29
So how does this fix that sending money to someone could be disabled by bank? Is it a decentralized system to what we would be sending money to?
