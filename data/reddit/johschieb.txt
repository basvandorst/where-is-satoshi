Nice, thanks for the link. Interesting lecture

Most people I know have heard about it, but nobody is interested in it which in my opinion stems from the fact that barely anybody knows anything about Bitcoin besides ist Name and the fact that the price dropped

The problem is:
Bitcoin has a small group of core developers. 
Some of them start working on a competing chain, that has an unclear revenue model, but obviously has the goal of transferring as many coins as possible to their chain.
Because this chain is in the hands of a centralized corporation, if the network starts to outweigh that of main-Bitcoin then bye bye decentralization.
If decentralization is gone why still use this chain? - The developers of the new chain are still the core devs of Bitcoin and obviously are inclined to influence the development of Bitcoin in a way that it stays behind their chain to keep it attractive.
In the end you have a classic corporation controlling a substantial userbase. The dream of decentralization and all its associated benefits have vanished.
Understand now? It's the ancient story of greed.
Edit: The issue obviously lies in the fact that simultaneously being bitcoin core-developer and working on a competing project through which you are seriously financially incentivized is maybe a little bit questionable.

No, that is not at all what I said.

Not everything is determined by the devs, but arguably the very core of the system is quite an essential part of it.
Because he would not own Bitcoin that way. 
If he first builds his own sidechain, attracts core-devs, attracts majority of Bitcoin's userbase, then constrains devs through clever contracts and financial incentives and slowly enforces his own rules... then he controls it.

It is a very worrying development and it's sad to see this potential threat to Bitcoin's decentralization.
As an avid coder myself it is beyond me how anyone could risk the very nature of what one has been working on for years being endangered for the simple prospect of monetary gains. 
The issue in this case though is the oxymoronic nature of the situation. Why develop a decentralized system only to then transfer it's value base to the confines of a classic centralized corporate structure? It is especially questionable in the case of Bitcoin, given it's ideology-loaded nature that is derived from the system's revolutionary status. 
I guess in the end even the most distinguished minds are susceptible to plain old greed.

That really is pretty impressive when you think about it.

This untrue belief has been suggested to you via clever rhetoric. The average block size is not even close to the 1 MB limit, besides the spam attack by Coinwallet.eu who have said that they support XT as well (surprise, surpise)
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:33:30
The fear, uncertainty and doubt XT has created is unsurpassed
@_date: 2015-07-08 11:53:02
Heh. I'd say that is not a bad guess
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:39:24
What kind of weak assumption is that? Do you know this guy?
Lets tell us all about the software you have contributed to!

I think it's always better to err on the side of caution. In this case at least suspicion is high enough to warrant a search for other options.
@_date: 2015-09-10 15:56:10
Did this happen? Do you have a link, as an afternoon delight?
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:32:58
Well it seems like the whole post has been removed...
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:11:15
I certainly agree.

It's seems like Blockchain.info is constantly flushing its mempool. Are Statoshi and Tradeblock a more accurate depiction of what the netowrk is experiencing?

Probably not the best day to advertise your exchange... Gemini casts a large shadow. Good luck though!

I suppose most will adjust their minrelaytxfee soonish
