How to route the linux client through tor? I've tried:
* proxychains
* torify
* torsocks
I can't find any documentation on configuration for proxies. As a matter of fact I can't find any documentation of any kind. 
Can BitPay please address this since it's a security issue?
Edit: Here's the reason proxychains won't allow tor proxy. This IP is dropping the connection. Thanks to laziness and cloudflare.

Nevermind, I already rm'd this POS.

Yeah, I have servers running bitcoind and electrum. That's not the point, but I appreciate the advice. Like I said, I rm'd it and moved on with my life to wallets that offer more powerful control (**BX** is my current fav).
