The individual is in the purchaser or the creator of bitcoin? Also is their a known creator? Sorry for the novice questions I'm just starting to dive in.

Mind taking the time in explaining the risk then? rather than just calling me delusional, maybe hit me with an explanation behind my delusion.

I did thank you Mr. Snipe, I also complimented you as a genius. 
Obviously it's a joke because you didn't answer any of my questions. All you did was call me delusional and contradict me stating it's not too risky of an investment. HasCatsFearsForLife* answered my post thoroughly. You instead just posted a dickish nonproductive comment.

Yeah seriously guy. You haven't provides any substance to this conversation YET &amp; frankly it's not desired at this point. If you had anything productive or decent to say you would've done so already. But no you start off the conversation by calling me delusional and not giving any explanation behind it. Nor did you have any constructive comments about the rest of my post. No I'm not delusional I'm simply a novice when it comes to bitcoin. Don't talk down me. If anything you should apologize. If not, then we're done here.
