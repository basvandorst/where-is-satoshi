That's the premise of Bitcoin, that energy expenditure is quantifiable while any other metric of "skin in the game" is not. Few proofs are (somewhat) comparable, and they're not as direct or as close to foolproof.
Miners gravitate towards honesty because it's in their best economic interest to do so.
They're more invested than most, and their ROI is far delayed compared to most other actors. Of course, if everyone *else* disagrees with them, then they'll own worthless heaters.
That's why consensus depends on PoW and not PoMerchant, PoExchange, PoNode, PoSocks or whatever else.
Thanks for posting this. I hope someone steps in to provide a tentative answer to the question, because I cannot.

Can someone please provide a serious definition of "economic actors" or "economic majority" here, because I'm not familiar with the term. Is it investors, users, hodlers, shotrers, logners, merchants, processors, exchanges, anyone I'm forgetting? How do we quantify them ?Do miners not count towards that ?
Thank you

No, they do not have caps for home connections, where are you getting this information? Are you just talking about mobile connections ? Would you watch Netflix with your mobile connection too ?
Even if you're in the US (which I'm assuming), the average there is 17.2 Mbps and improving 5.5% quarter over quarter.
Global average connectivity speeds are increasing very fast : 
* Above 4Mpbs: 15% yoy increase 
* Above 10Mpbs: 31% yoy increase
* Above 15Mbps: 37% yoy increase
* Above 25Mpbs: 45% yoy increase
Global average speeds are 7Mpbs, changing qoq 12% and yoy 26%
Data caps and the speeds needed to run a full node, are a joke for most European and Asian urban home connections. Blame monopolies for keeping you in the connectivity backwater of the planet, it's hubris expecting everyone else to slow down.

No one is arguing that it has to continue forever. The same dynamic method could carry us well into the (even near) future, until and at such time as 2nd layer solutions are ready to kick ass globally. I personally do not believe they will, but I'll vehemently defend their right to exist and get equal opportunities as every other solution. 
The fallacy of an "almost unbound demand" falls flat on its face once you see the above chart, or any other low cost/transaction altcoin. Are they filling up daily and constantly? I thought so.
Yes, I agree, we need more solutions, but they must compete on the same grounds once they all exist, not in spite of each other. We don't get to choose, the market does, and rewards us accordingly (or not).

Ok, I'll bite. Please indulge us with how this chart was produced (until 2016 at least):
 
Then please go on and tell everyone why other methods will fare better.
