so what if you dont have the bitcoin to cover the costs? does it bill you like a normal credit card?

You are right but I also believe Andreas did a good job explaining how the business will just move elsewhere where regulations are better suited. These senators want the next googles and microsofts in their countries and money talks.

I think that BTC ad on reddit was pretty successful the one with the wizard.

Also if they say they got the money or bitcoin from selling drugs, walk away. That is how they got some guys in florida.

HOLY SHIT, that was impressive. Im pretty sure every member of the Canadian Senate is going to buy some bitcoin after that.  Jesus christ he was impressive.

what "technique" are you talking about? The guy is selling his coins, nothing should be illegal or forbidden about what he is doing.
