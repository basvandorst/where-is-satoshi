Btc markets is stellar.
Not much you can do about the premium, just the way it is.
During a down turn is the only time I've seen the prices level out with the US.

Eth difficulty adjusts per block so it's a different scenario.

There are hundreds of examples, betamax, Walkman, vcr, intranet, MySpace, Nokia.. the list goes on.

Except it says "long position" so they're betting for bitcoin not against it, which is confusing in this context.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding it.

Organise for someone to spam your wallet with dust for what ever reason it is that they do it.

You should just use a block explorer in the future to double check the transaction.

It was visible months ago when I was looking to offload a small amount of coin.
I think they're having banking problems which is preventing them from accepting sells, not sure really but I hope they come back on line they were always good to me, although since using btcmarkets I don't see any reason I would go back to them.

Hideous hideous stuff, stick to the Carlton

I would disagree lost coins have no relationship to value.
Less coins in supply certainly has an effect on price.

I feel you're getting confused here.
There is no source code available to you because the project is not open source.

Hello fellow kids thank you for this suggestion

What’s the additional fee?
Only a miner fee is required to move BTC.

Yes you will always own coins on both chains until you seperate them or make a transaction on one chain and get replayed on the other (might only be possible in one direction as I believe BCC has replay protection).
Still worth taking the time to seperate them sooner rather than later, I'd wait until the dust settles and approved methods are published though by reputable members of the community before attempting it.

Did you not click the sell button that has a massive big warning explaining sells are currently disabled?
Why on earth would you be blaming them for you inability to read.
Also, they are not an exchange, they are brokers.
Maybe do a bit more research next time before coming onto social media and rubbishing them.
I have used the 10+ times and it's always been a pleasant experience apart from the pretty high fees / spread.
If you want an exchange use btc markets.
