I like to measure the value of things in Double Cheeseburgers (DCB).  These are a relatively stable thing in value, more so than even dollars.  Also, I eat lots of BK Double Cheeseburgers, so it's convenient for me to peg the value of the dollar against the cost of a DCB.
Back around the very early beginnings of Bitcoin, a DCB cost about $1 USD (at BK).  Of note, this DCB also had TWO slices of cheese, so to be clear, the value is down a bit.  Nowadays, with only a single slice of cheese, it costs around $1.69.  So that is a pretty big move over ~9 years.  Absolutely true, that there is a significant change in value.
But lets compare this to Bitcoin.  Now I don't know the Pizza to Burger exchange rate, but back when my DCB cost me $1, a Pizza it is known cost 10000 BTC.  And how many BTC does a Pizza cost today?  Probably around 0.001 BTC for a pretty good quality Pizza?  And 6 months ago that number was what, 0.005 BTC?  1 year ago, about 0.02 BTC?
To suggest that Bitcoin is "no worse" than the Dollar for pegging daily fluctuations is absurd.  It is simply absurd.  I have bitcoins dating to Feb 2012.  I think crypto is the future.  But that is patently false.  USD, while we want to move away from that, is still useful as a relatively (and the key word that I used was "relatively") stable peg for value.  I know, you want to ignore dollars and arrive at the decentralized future (me too) but the fact is that the USD is pretty fucking great for pegging short term changes in value right now.  Yes, inflation exists (and is a problem), but it's not like anyone is pegging crypto to Bolivars.

A lot of day traders do compare alts to Satoshis because they are usually trading in those.  In both cases, it boils down to convenience.  If you want to get actual value, USD is the best benchmark that's easy to understand.  If you're asking how much it's going to cost you to buy an alt on an exchange, BTC or Sats probably better communicate that info.

(Disclaimer:  I believe the future is filled with "alts" and that this us v them mentality of bitcoin vs everything else is toxic.  The nice thing about pegging shit to USD instead of, say, Bitcoin, is that you aren't putting cryptos against each other, but rather acknowledging the true, mutual enemy, which is fiat government money.)
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:31:02
Decentralized to a few warehouses in China running hundreds of thousands of ASIC miners.  True decentralization, yuppers.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:35:34
No, there is inherent value behind everything.  Fiat dollars are not value, but they have value behind them.  Value is what we attach to things.
It just so happens that USD is relatively stable compared to the wild fluctuations of Crypto, that it makes sense to peg crypto to USD as sort of a shorthand for "value."  In actuality, you would have to take the inflation rates of USD into account to get an accurate reading of the "true" value (when referencing dollar exchange rates to determine value). 
But using BTC as if it were a stable marker of value is beyond absurd.

Bcash is a scamcoin run by people interested in preserving ASIC-Boost mining, which is more toxic than even normal ASIC mining in terms of centralization effects.  It will NEVER implement SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:33:33
But we are talking about "value" here.  BTC were not as valuable then as they are today, by a very large margin of difference, so the comparison is unfair.
Everyone loves when BTC blows through USD milestones but as soon as someone compares an alt to the same peg they get defensive and peg the alt against BTC as if that is relevant.
USD is not perfectly stable in value, and does slowly decrease in value over time.  But it is relatively stable compared with the wild rollercoaster ride of pick your favorite crypto.  So it makes perfect sense to peg short term fluctuations to USD as convenient shorthand for value.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:38:42
PS: One could also make the argument that Bitcoin's gains are not as spectacular if we peg it to, say, 2008 dollars.  If you attach a date to USD, you CAN pin it down as a stable measure of value.  These things are not arbitrary, we know how much less a dollar today is worth than it was in 2008.  My DCB example exaggerates the actual rate of inflation.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:20:58
Bitcoin is a dated proof-of-concept coin that is brilliant, but supplanted by newer alt coins with better use-cases.
Bcash is straight up a scamcoin.  Fuck no.
ASIC mining in general is pretty toxic to the idea of decentralization, and Bcash only makes that problem worse by preserving ASIC-Boost.
I am all in on alts with good use-cases and ASIC-resistance.  Smart contract coins and privacy coins really appeal to me.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:30:55
Have to laugh at all the butthurt when the flaws of an ASIC-mined coin are pointed out.  Everyone rushes out to accuse me of being a Bcash shill even though Bcash is measurably worse on the ASIC front than even Bitcoin.
Satoshi was a genius and he ushered in the era of Cryptocurrency.  But ASIC mining should be seen for what it is: An attack on the PoW algorithm that serves to centralize hashing power into the hands of the most wealthy.  Everything Bitcoin wasn't supposed to be.
Sorry, but that's the truth.  ASIC mining is a tremendous problem for Bitcoin and it's derivatives that don't strive for ASIC resistance.  I have ASIC resistance as a requirement for any crypto I seriously invest in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:49:57
Hah.  I've been day trading and buying and selling ~$150.  I have been doing this mostly on a for funsies basis and haven't actually made money.  Just how fucked am I on taxes for not having gained more than maybe twenty dollars?
Not that I am going to pay taxes for not making money, fuck the government, but theoretically how bad could it get if I, say, bought and sold $150 worth of bitcoin a hundred times, each one of those theoretically being a "taxable event?"
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:55:37
This is true, look at Monero if you want to see some serious shit slinging.  But the constant forking of Bitcoin has troubled me.  I still have a fragment of a coin I picked up in Feb of 2012, for the record, I've been around for a while and always thought Bitcoin was the future.  I've shifted my mentality towards alts now though.  Crypto is the future.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:17:00
Or sell for cash to a guy in a dark alley and don't let the cash hit a bank account.  Or trade for gold.  Or whatever.

Oh, it's not out yet.  Normies FOMOing and FUDing in cycles is going to keep sending it up, for now.  This crash would have to hit like 2k for BTC to be truly dead and gone.  I'll be surprised if it drops below 10k tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:27:15
Bitcoin (and all of its forks including the Bcash scam coin) are a primitive prototype and proof-of-concept for decentralized currency.  Mathematically brilliant, practically useless.  Bitcoin is the foundation for other cryptos which will replace it.  There are hundreds of more useful coins.  Privacy coins like Monero, decentralized code coins like Ethereum.  Bitcoin can't even be used as a currency anymore because of transaction fees, it's just used for speculation.  Even if transaction fees are solved, other issues will persist (including community infighting and forking).  Bitcoin will perish once people become smart enough to understand the underlying tech.  Right now, normies are being exposed for the first time.  Might take a while, BTC might hit 100k or more before people realize it, but I feel alts will reign supreme.  Crypto is here to stay, Bitcoin is not, but enjoy the ride while it lasts.
I am heavily invested in Ethereum and looking to move into Neo, Monero, and Verge, for reference.  I think that's where it's at.  I only keep small sides of BTC and LTC to hedge my bets.  I understand this is r/bitcoin and not r/cryptocurrency, but Bitcoin isn't going to last in the face of better tech, just because it was the first.
Right now, of course, the whole scene is down, which is a shame, but if it all goes to ashes, I think altcoins rise above to reign supreme, leaving Bitcoin behind as a chapter in history.
Best advice remains to invest in big coins before they hit Coinbase.  Monero looks hot.  I'd also buy Ripple just for the bump and then sell it immediately after Coinbase pumps it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:26
Bcash was never at 9500, that was just GDAX being silly.  Elsewhere it peaked at about 4000.  Might have been a coordinated show for normies on Coinbase, or it might have just been normies following eachother off a cliff, who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:51:17
Note this was on an exchange so I never had private keys, just a promise from GDAX that I owned so much BTC in their wallets...
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:35:55
If you like to gamble, then sure.  But this is like a guy who just -knows- black is going to come up on the roulette wheel.  As is, people who held to this point have made profit.
I don't know why you think "FUD" is going to be gone as Bitcoin forks into a FOURTH(/fifth) currency.  How many more times will Bitcoin fork before the chaos kills the entire lineage?  I'm pretty concerned about it, seems to me the biggest threat long term to Bitcoin.  How are the masses supposed to adopt a currency that forks every week?  Value only goes up with mass adoption.  This many forks should be worrisome.
This is a bit of a different topic than the current bubble (meaning: past week) though, you're a fool if you think this extreme volatility is going to sustain.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:11:25
Alt coins are down somewhat while Bitcoin spikes.  Particular Altcoins would be a wise investment right now.  Bitcoin will crash and alts will rise, then put your money back into Bitcoin when BTC is low and alts are high.
You probably will not get the difference in B2X, this bubble is too high.  B2X is probably going to be around 1k in a best case scenario, and then rapidly fall as people sell it off to convert to BTC.  BTC will probably bump a little, then crash back down to around $5k.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:06:57
I don't think the fork coins are going to make up for the inevitable post-fork collapse.  I am suggesting it is wiser to get out just before the fork, then buy back in at the bottom of what should be a highly predictable crash.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:12:49
~24hrs after according to emails they sent.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:28:04
You could try to get out immediately after the fork, but so is everyone else who is buying in at 7k to get forkcoins.  Your choice, your risk.  Getting out before is less risky.  Waiting until after is rolling the dice that the fork coins are going to make up for the losses when the price crashes.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:57:18
I wouldn't short, an infinite risk play on bitcoin is pretty foolish.  I'd just sell what you have now and buy back after this bubble pops down probably to about $5500 post-fork (or lower if things get really heated and chaotic)
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:21:57
People are moving altcoins to BTC for free fork coins.  If $5k isn't a bubble, THIS absolutely is.  Ride it until a few days before the fork, then sell and get the fuck out before the crash.  This won't sustain.
The fact that Coinbase and GDAX are providing immediate access to the free forkcoins is driving the masses to move assets to Bitcoin.  Going to be chaos when everyone moves back to their alt coins.  Sell high and buy back in after the crash.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:03:52
I was a believer but the constant forking has me scared.  People can't agree on a direction and keep splitting the chain.  It's bad news.  The hope was that, years into the future, the currency would stabilize in value, cease being volatile, and become a functional currency rather than an asset.  The constant forking threatens stability, and the average user isn't going to be able to parse through what is going on.  Forking needs to stop for Bitcoin to become a currency, but I don't see an end to the forking.  This latest one with replay attacks is especially a bad sign, as forks become more hostile and spiteful in nature.
My faith is shaken for the first time in many years.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:59:14
Coins don't double.  You get an equal amount of coins on two blockchains when it splits.  If I had 10 dollars and I then got 1 yen for every dollar, I'd have 10 yen and 10 dollars, I wouldn't have 20 dollars.

If you tried day trading the moonshot, sure, you probably lost.  The moonshots are too fast, but the downhill, historically, is nice and slow, easy to play.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:03:40
True, never put in what you aren't willing to lose.  But I think it's pretty safe at this point, for the long term, barring something truly extreme that totally shifts global society (like, say, nuclear war).
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:27:06
Historic crashes had some major bounces.  It's a trap.  Be very surprising if it even touches 4k before going down way below 3k.

But certainly, selling at the 3k wall regardless if you think trend is down or up, not very smart.

The flaw is that you are imagining a universe where everyone is a hive mind and believes the same thing, and not one person sells a coin for less.  It's a stupid and pointless statement, you are describing an alternate universe that is completely alien to reality.  People are selling at $3300 and below as of writing.  Your statement is "if nobody sells below $4200 then the price stays at $4200" which is 1) obvious and 2) highly unrealistic.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:25:15
You don't tell them to recover the wallet, you tell them you want the data off the drive, not what it is.
Most places are professional and don't snoop through, they just check a few files to make sure the integrity of the data is there and that they were successful.
If they did steal the money, it would be provable through the public block chain, and you press charges for theft and/or sue for breach of contract.  Pros aren't anonymous, since you are hopefully taking it to someone reputable and not to a stranger in the back alley.
Society still exists, just because Bitcoin exists doesn't mean law stops functioning.  This is a really dumb concern to have.  A reputable pro isn't going to steal their customer's shit, they work with sensitive data all the time.

Bad advice.  Sell what you have on this bounce.  It's gonna go down again, buy when it goes down to the next wall, then ride the bounce up.

You have, more or less, until China wakes up and sees that they need to mass sell all their coins before the markets shut down.  Early USA market will have a repeat rally off those losses when they get up in the morning.  Probably going to drop to at least 2.8 today when China kicks in, maybe lower.  3k wall will shatter.

Again, you also don't advertise what it is.  You don't tell them you're looking for your Bitcoin wallet.  You don't tell them that you were a miner 7 years ago and might have millions of dollars worth.  You just go somewhere reputable and ask for a data recovery.  They aren't interested in stealing your bitcoins, their company is probably worth more than your bitcoins.  They're interested in maintaining their reputation and their business.

Bigger issue is that the platters need to be super exactly aligned, even slightly off and you've just scrambled all your data.  So you have to move them as a solid unit.  No do-overs, no retry if you mess up.
You would want to do it under a fume hood at a minimum, as well.  Also have to be worried about the read/write heads, etc.
Really, it's an involved process.  Explore all other options, and if you've never opened one before, send it to a pro.  I wouldn't recommend trying unless you've practiced on expendable drives first and have it down to a reliable skill.
