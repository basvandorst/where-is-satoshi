Most days i wake up thinking my knowledge of crypto is above average. Then I realize how stupid I truly am when I see posts like yours. Then I realize how much stupider the rest of the population is, and can only be thankful that at the very least I care to educate myself further and have caught onto the wave early.
Thank you for this info, lots of research to do today!

Interesting. Does it matter too much? Seeing as the fiat money in my wallet could have been previously laundered after being gained through criminal activities, is the onus on me to see where my BTC has come from? As long as I received it in a fair and recorded transaction

Whoa wtf is tainted BTC?
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:33:42
Definitely something I’ll have to look more into. 
As for tainted coins, I don’t think I have any to test it out

You could use this logic for any bad thing that happens in a country. Why does Trump tweets about bitcoin when he should be focusing on gun crime? Why does Boris talk about Brexit when science tells us climate change will kill us all if we don’t change our ways? Why does President X debate about topic Y when Crime Z is a huge problem?

You can educate the ignorant without being hostile. This is meant to be an educational community

You or I may be able to pull the content out of a message but not everyone is the same. A lot of people don’t ask questions for fear of looking stupid. Gaining knowledge and learning is never stupid, so when you’re educating, there is no need to consistently call someone naive or “a complete novice”; that affects mentality of the person trying to learn. You can just be much nicer and more sensitive. We’re all on the same page here, adoption of a new financial system. 
That’s why I don’t get the pussy or snowflake comments. I’m thick skinned enough to see what content is truly relevant but some may not. Yet us cryptofolk still whine about the lack of education out there and why people can’t see this incoming financial wave of disruption. It might be because we alienate people by talking as if we are better than them. We are not; for every one of us that has gotten into this world, there is someone who beat us to it. So if we could all not be a bunch of cunts and be just a little more sympathetic, things would be great. And this applies to me too, a continuous bettering process where I try not to be a cunt as much as possible. Again, I am not better than anyone else

Other countries kill people because of their skin color. Every country is messed up, let’s stop pretending the worst of humanity is concentrated to one area
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:09:38
Gotcha! Thank you
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:31:51
That’s insane. So how am I to check if my coins are tainted? And specifically, how do I check if they’re tainted pre transaction? From what you’re saying, knowing the coin is tainted after the transaction still leaves me screwed with devalued coins

It’s not that deep. I suggested that he could be nicer. 
Calling him a complete novice many times over and calling him naive is just a different way of saying you’re an idiot. I’m sure OP knows he is a novice. 
Here’s an analogy; a heavy person asks advice about weightlifting and cardio. Answering with “you’re so fat that you wouldn’t know this but actually weightlifting is better than cardio for weight loss”. The content is correct, the tone is not. That’s what this guy has done.
Also, why are people acting like I’m so damn offended and that I’m losing my mind over here? The guy could be nicer, that’s literally all I’ve said, this is a community for education. Seems like you’ve gotten much more upset at my response asking a person to be nice. Ask yourself why that would upset you so.
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:05:41
Definitely not docile. The guy is calling OP an idiot while simultaneously swinging his virtual dick around saying “I know better haha”. Relatively speaking, there will always be someone smarter than you, so being a little kind while educating wouldn’t be the worst thing. I do appreciate the fact that the information was useful

Thank you for encapsulating what my intent was. I have been unable to be clear with my thoughts today
@_date: 2019-07-24 07:15:12
Naive question perhaps, but where’s the incentive for miners to verify a transaction that’s not relevant to their money supply?
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:14:28
No dumb questions here, some people are at advanced learning stages some are beginner learning stages. Everyone here is learning.
I too have no clue about UTxO hygiene, anyone care to explain? I know UTxO but in relation to safety standards and how they are relevant to me, no clue.

Man fuck this elitist nonsene. You firstly had the opportunity to educate; do that. Secondly he’s giving us insight on UX that is important is getting widespread adoption.
Ultimately you’re the idiot here, there is opportunity in this post to get another crypto believer and to finetune user experience, but you continue believing you’re better than the rest because you own a few coins.

Enjoy your cheap entertainment I guess. My point was people would be smart to approach this from a different perspective than you, so I don’t really care if you agree or not.

No don’t get wrong, I’m always happy if the net outcome is beneficial, couldn’t care about the intent. With that disclaimer, he is definitely a dreamer and optimistic and is delivering on his own visions. But of course there has to be a basis in self-interest, how can this venture or course of action benefit me? For example, he open sourced the foundational tech for electric cars. Not because his aim was to fight the oil industry, but because he had to jumpstart the industry to achieving the goal of electric vehicles. Why? Because he believes Tesla is a far and clear leader in this space and the sooner electric becomes the industry norm, the sooner Tesla can realize gains. 
I guess the point I’m driving is that there has to be a symbiosis in advancing society and that his business ventures aim to supplement a futuristic society. So backing a candidate like Yang is likely only done after considerable analysis of what Yang would bring to the table.
Edit: no advertising can be as cool as advertising. Think of the perception of Tesla’s today. In some ways, it’s a “I’m better than you” car. Believe me, when every car on the road is electric or hybrid, Tesla will advertise in some shape or form. Hell, even having Musk as a CEO is a type of advertising.
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:19:54
I’ll admit, zero research done on my end. But a well qualified professor while I was in university told me how a large part of Musk’s compensation is based upon stock price and that to some degree he’s a hypeman for his own gain.
They are not mutually exclusive, he can both be the least profit driven CEO around while also being a hypeman. I just can’t assume taking a stance like this is detrimental to him, he has to have considered the pros and cons. Then again, this is the guy who arbitrarily chose a price of 420 to impress his gf so who knows how much thought he really puts behind his tweets.

Come on. There has to be a net benefit that we’re not thinking of just yet

Speculative but likely this + Bakkt having low volume
