Yes psychologically it def makes Sense. 
What im thinking about here is that, from the Tweet, it seems the Chinese exchanges are conserned with the PBoC view on BTC rise in value after having held meetings with the PBoC. 
So Its not that the mBTC is not a good ideer. Its more the incentive to do so that makes me think..

The "appease" word/statement Bobby made was regarding another issue. You mix it up. And the reason they put fees are that they need to make money because they stoped margin trading.

Not really thinking about if good ideer ore not here. More about the statement itselfs 
The plan ( units) has been discussed amongst local  exchanges, &amp; we believe it will appease the regulators, w/ "lower" prices.
More in paticular:
"We believe it will appease the regulators, w/ "lower" prices."

What makes me a bit nervous is that, after inspektions/medtings with the PBoC the CEO of one of the Exchanges feels a need to appease the regulators. Mmmmm

In other words. If you want to find a Way to appease someone about something it must be because they are not appeased about it... here being prices
