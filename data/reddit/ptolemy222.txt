Coinbase has a careers section.
I also often see soft-engineers on indeed for crypto companies.
Be wary of scams though. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:27:31
The central banking system is based on belief. That's why you trust your own money. You trust and believe the fiat currency. 
In fact a lot of institutions are built on belief. Bitcoin is just another thing with particular properties that people can choose to "Believe" or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:13:24
Because the steep speed in growth. How people are talking. It sounds EXACTLY like the dot com bubble. 
It's all signs of a bubble. Whether it is or not. It's happening too fast. 
There isn't mass adoption yet. and people are unsure if this is THE next currency or not. Plus a lot of people are 
1. Speculating it will be valuable in the future. 
2. Taking out loans to buy bitcoin. 
3. Buying on feeling and upward trend.
If you're buying by feeling, that is never a good sign, but that's what people are doing and it's scary. "If anything is too good to be true... It probably is."
*Update* Listen to this guy talk about the "Dot-com" revolution. Replace what he's saying about the internet with bitcoin. (1 minute long).  
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:12:22
I'm just saying to look for signs and signals. And I don't think anything in history goes up this fast. 
saying that I'm happily invested. I just like to go to the extremes and see if there's a bubble or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:49:04
I am really interested to see what happens. I’m going to hodl as best as I can. 
In fact. Maybe it’d be best to turn off bitcoin for a few months. Haha
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:44:27
At this rate it’ll be 40k at the end of 2017
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:43:08
Found it. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:29:13
Oh. I miss understood.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:12:45
I bought a bit in June 2017 when it was roughly 3k.
I read into it a lot. and I trust it. It's more about what it stands for then its worth. It's worth more than money and gives people the option to avoid centralized system. I think that's really really cool. :)
I feel great! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:51:01
Once it hits a high price the variance wouldn't be significant enough such that you can spend it anywhere at a stable price. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:47:17
It hit 20k in coinbase. What the fuuuuuuu 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:27:51
Not gonna lie. You're making it sound like a dot com bubble tbh. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:32:49
So your saying look at dec 24-Jan 1?  Big things are happening?  You think Massive sell offs after big players start shorting? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:14:54
My worry is that people are doing what ever it takes to get in on this. If they are over spending credit cards... They're going to have to sell to pay back credit card companies. or where ever else they're getting money. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:26:56
Be careful with that. 
the Dot-Com bubble was caused by people putting money into anything with (.com) at the end of it. Then when it crashed, the stocks were useless. 
Each currency is different. Bitcoin was the original and is used as "Just" currency. Other currencies like Etherem, and others DO has other positive uses. It's good to investigate what they are, why they're good, and who made them. Do you trust what they're saying?
There's a lot of shit coins out there. So Be careful.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:11:12
Should have a second bitcoin sub-reddit for 
1. The current price
2. Buy/hodl
3. Is it too late to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:13:25
Let me know when you get accepted to QuadrigaCX. It's been about a week for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:37:09
At that point. It would make sense to trust in gold. as the gold standard is probably the best standard in the world. But it's harder to transfer. 
Gold will always be worth the same value for bartering. Lots of Crypto fanatics are still buying gold "Just in case" As everyone has a slight paranoia. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:38:01
Originally people liked the currency because it was 1. Fast 2. Cheap 3. Decentralized 4. Transparent 5. Semi-anonymous. People still like it now because it's the original decentralized currency. 
Yes new better currencies can come in (Many people will argue this, but BCash was supposed to be an improvement because it has low fees, and high transaction times)
As well, many people are hoping that there will be new soon software improvements to increase speeds and lower transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:02:43
Why do you think so? I figured if Wall Street was joining in investment, it might cause a lot of movement. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:26:21

Bruh. Are you okay? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:45
Theres a website that shows you who’s buying bitcoin live. I forget the web address. 
*edit* found it. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:56:53
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:46:09
All of it. The odds of an alt coin hype is rare. And it’s news based. Hard to catch. I am interested in iota though. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:51:22
Hopefully one day BTC will be worth 1 million and you will have a good time :)
GOOD LUCK! Be aware!
Also, I think asking for donations is against the rules. BEWARE!
"Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to."
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:00:14
Oh. I'm just really confused now. I am not sure what's going to happen. I am just worried about governments shutting down based on the loss of taxation. As well as people that benefit but do not help build society. 
Your right. I mean it's not only for bitcoin, but other cryptocurrency. I am unsure what's going to happen. This is just really big. But I have a bit of trust. I'm just thinking a lot. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:32:54
1. Where does the government get funding if only a select few accept the rules of law? Would we separate into separate governments based ideals and what people pay into? Particularly if everyone moves to bitcoin being the medium of exchange is what I'm saying. Or would there be a balance between crypto and government? 
2. Would that mean bitcoin can only increase in value based on the losses of money? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:26:49
1.  Interesting. I am interested to see how it pans out
2. My issue with lack of coins is that there is value that is being lost. Does that affect bitcoin. How will that affect the future as more bitcoin is lost. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:24:32
Actually, the whole point that people buy it is because two people have trust in it.
I'm thinking long term, what is going to happen? 
Because there is always spenders and savers.
Is it going to bubble and everyone is going to stop spending? The rich are only going to allow to let people borrow if they see a return. but if no money is being produced, then the return can't really be financial. It will make a society of winners and losers. rich and poor. I am sort of curious to see how it plays out, and I have bitcoin. I think it's pretty great so far. I'm just wondering how it's going to play out. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:28:55
It's not very easy. 
China can ban a website (Google, Facebook, Youtube, Bitcoin) because it's high in authoritarian in nature.
But most western countries would have massive uproar and need a pretty strong reason to ban this. 
There are some speculations that the currency can go to funding terror, and other things. which is why it's in talks right now on what to do about it. 
But most people in the US have the bitcoin to buy good people. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:13:20
Yeah, you can’t blame one exact factor. But the banks were printing money like crazy from hyper inflation. But this is different. 
As well. This is a better definition of the decentralized part of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:39:31
I hope for the positive benefits. But unless there is a mass adoption to other people. People are going to be interested in other means of trade. Everyone is going for bitcoin based on the current growth. But there are other options. It could just make everything over valued and maybe not pop but just deflate. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:43:00
Starts 4 minutes in. As well this video does focus on the negative effects. But really, Western countries have a lot more stability then say Zimbabwe. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:58:20
It doesn't mater. Price of bitcoin will continue to rise. And the new technology for transferring bitcoin is being created. It will continue to be used. The new 1 bitcoin is 0.1 bitcoin. If the prices rise, you're still winning. 
Unless there is a bug satoshi knows about that we don't. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:19:20
I do kind of hope for this. But the people at the bottom are going to find other ways around it. They aren't going to want to play a game already against them. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:34:46
Just as long as you're not betting your own testicle. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:48:43
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:09:33
True. It would be interesting if he said anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:55:19
People are working on this being an easy transferable form of currency. 
It's either going to be very mainstream or flop. 
If it does become more mainstream, it could be very good. 
If it doesn't you could lose everything. My personal views is that the reward could be VERY VERY good. It's so early. 
BUT I AM NOT ADVISING ANYONE! Do with what you will. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:56:13
Hits you at 23:00 minutes. Bitcoin can really revolutionize everything. Starts around 4:00 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:38:01
Anti-Bank, as well as the economic growth. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:05:06
I meant instead of bitcoin. I assume in the long run Bcash would win based on fees. But Can't there be software improvements to Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:18:40
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:45:25
Okay. Now what?  I have learned that for ever dollar the government spends, they make 1.4 in return.
I am an engineer. I took classes in economics. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:29:16
I think everyone knows about the ride. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:39:11
Excuse my ignorance. Is this real? You have source? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:33:13
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:03:35
If this is open source can't bitcoin core be improved? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:15:40
Maybe Bitcoin should be the crypto currency for mars?
or a new one needs to be made "The Tesla Coin" idk.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:41:30
Canadain here. Just here to say WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:10:16
I guess there bitcoin would ultimately lead to a borrow and spend situation? 
But I guess it would be from corporations instead of banks. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:18:18
When is the technology going to catch up to the value? 
If people have more money in government cash, a system with heavy infrastructure already, then why even think of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:35:25
Take due care in your future transactions... Maybe one day it could be worth 100,000.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:27:10
This is exactly my biggest concern. I mean, I think it would be best if the banking system just gave everyone their share, and taught people how to use it. Either that or it's just going to be nerd money. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:59:04
This is more what I'm looking for.
My only concern is major organizations hodling but not willing to put in their money for circulation which is what many banks do. They may also create useless jobs. So I am unsure how this will all play out. Although, I hope i's for the better. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:10:46
I got some limited access for a brief moment. Even though it was still really fudgy.
Can't say I know anything about the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:41:24
Yeah. Job. Start making a living. Any job counts. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:37:30
I meant by projection. I think it’s good to be aware of what the possibilities are. And it’s possible to predict what happens. 
All I am looking for here is that if the savers just save all of their money or bitcoin. That will probably stall the economy. That’s very concerning. 
I am just looking for someone who would know. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:43:57
:D loving the love. Sending love back at you.

Almost $10,000 Canadian!
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:07:25
Sorry if it seems like a threat to your bitcoin. But if there is clear answer then I’d have more trust in bitcoin. You don’t seem to know. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:59:17
I personally feel like Bitcoin is still early in the game. I think it's going to take off like crazy i a year. Just me though. 
JUST HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:52:38
For, like a fork in the road and you have 2 paths, in this case it's 2 coins. Pretty much what I have summed up is that the miners are going to use 2 different softwares. The coin will split into 2 types. If you are holding, then it doesn't apply much to you. It's more about the miners.
The coins will split into 2 and if you're in a trusted wallet, they will give you equal coins until they find out the dominant coin, and move that to bitcoin.
This is from my speculation, if anyone more involved can verify this. Let me know!
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:19:11
This is what I;m looking for. I am looking for more information because I don't know everything about it I want to learn.
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:39:14
As a Canadian. I am here for this reason!
Hoping price sticks this time. haha.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:09:08
You can use GDax which is from the same company. But you're trading at that point. So basically you are placing bids on what you think it's worth and someone will pay or not. 
As well, like coinbase, it doesn't work well in canada. I am unsure of any other trading platforms.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:30:35
Is he puking or eating money?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:23:08
It's in case of money laundering.
As well, there are teams designated to the security of wallets. These people want to keep trust in bitcoin because they own bitcoin themselves. 
Not to mention this is a very new technology. Lots of people are putting work into it to try and make it work. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:19:29
But if that were the case. Then the financial institution do cause corruption. As well as politicians. I am unsure what you mean that it doesn’t. Or do you mean it doesn’t fit corruption in the description I put. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:51:03
This is actually good because the more people that have it and want to spread the wealth. 
Once you have some, you want it to grow. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:04:35
Okay. So how would this run banks out of the picture? How does this reduce corruption I hear so much about with the use of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:03:04
Spent paycheck at the ATH.
Crying at the Dip.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:52:09
But for example. The reason that people post pictures of Zimbabwe currency is that the banks caused massive inflation. So there was no trust in their own centralized government. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:11:40
Waiting for the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:02:53
The world form of currency will move to crypto over time as banks are untrustworthy and fiat is self destructive naturally. 
All the coin you hold onto right now would be worth millions. as the world supply of money is 74-600 Trillion. Only 21 million Bitcoin in the world. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:16:49
MY worry is that there are definitely people out there that won't accept bitcoin. And those who bought early are all holding on to their huge gold piles. 
No one is going to want to make transactions with that. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:10:55
Engineer here. I took some economics classes. NOT SURE IF ANY OF THIS MAKES SENSE OR HELPS BUT I'M GOING TO TRY because I've had similar doubts in the past. 
1) &gt;But with this being the case, why would anyone ever spend Bitcoin? With a deflationary currency (as opposed to an inflationary one, like the US dollar) the incentive is always to "HODL," not to actually spend it. 
Some people assume when it becomes valuable enough that the possibility of change of growth will level off a bit. It won't be as volatile as it is now if it reached something like $100,000/BTC.  Once it reaches a more stable state, it will act like regular money again. So business owners still need to spend, people will make other investments, and circulation will continue. People still need to buy things like food and housing. 
 
2) Similarly, let's fast forward to a world in which Bitcoin is the dominant currency. This is the goal, as I understand it. If this happens, then debts too will be denominated in Bitcoin. Most (but not all) debts are arranged as fixed amounts.
If Bitcoin is going to continue to err on the side of being deflationary, couldn't this be a problem? 


Just to make sure I know what you're saying. The debt will increase relative to bitcoins value? I think even if bitcoin grew in value the price of the loan would stay 75k. So People going to school have to pay less bitcoin over time. Also, I don't think it will knock out all currencies. 
Some people are looking into making prices more stable, and when a deal is made it is up to the person that takes a loan to agree on a fixed amount. Most loans are taken out by banks, but I am assuming there will be different means of acquiring value. 
 
3) 


Think about the Spanish inquisition. When the spanish returned from central america they brought back loads of gold flooding the market, and caused massive increase in the production of goods. Then prices went up because there was a stress to improve ones-self. They make more money, and they pay the worker based on their agreements. 
Inflation is not a bad thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:41:52
Is there a link to the article? I want to read what it means for NYC.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:53:07
He thinks it's primarily for illegal transactions.
As well, I personally think if he were to buy bitcoin, it would probably make a political statement. Might even get hate from people he knows and probably has a lot of trust with the US government.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:47:11
I’m kind of worried because I’m in Canada. And coinbase doesn’t support transfers very well. I was hoping to sit back and let it happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:56:11
As a Canadian. I am here for this exact reason.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:03:22
I really just want to do that. But they never actually chilled at the bar in that movie. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:40:11
420,000 blaze it! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:49:47
This is a really good answer. I just get confused because I am imagining the starters of bitcoin probably have hundreds of coin. If they passed away. It’s gone forever. 
Does this mean that bitcoin value will only forever increase?
