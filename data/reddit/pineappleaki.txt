So I was sent this video but 30 seconds in I felt like this guy was weak on points, by the end of the video I felt like all he did was talk about other crashes and not say anything about the success stories (Amazon is the only one that comes to mind)
Anyway I was probably too biased and was wondering if someone else can tell me their opinion on the video

So if HODL means that what does SODL mean
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:57:40
The way i see it is: Put money you want to lose, if you get out before the crash you made a good profit. if not, you didn't mind that money being lost in the first place

Does that mean we're smart? u/harambe__lover

When is your personal opinion to buy bitcoin?¿?
So I've got some now however I want to buy more would people suggest just going for it or waiting for a dip (if there is going to be a dip)
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:56:49
Fuck, that's alot but I guess it will drive the market cap up like crazy. Although make bitcoin more volatile than it already is and gives a bigger risk. (Am I correct in saying that?)
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:37:18
Didn't even know of this, could you elaborate please? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:02:21
I would say wait till the end of year but anything could happen and you seem to have planned this well enough to massively benefit you.
(Congratulations btw)

Good news for bitconnect then I guess :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:49:32
I don't see it falling (or rising that much) I agree with the idea just less intense than that 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:34:04
Ahahah no worries, learnt alot from that paragraph so thank you

• Bitcoin has its legacy
• Ethereum has smart contracts
• Litecoin can be used as everyday payments
Those are the ones I believe will definitely survive and the reason for it but I'm sure there will be many others, some yet to be created

That's what I was thinking about 7,8 and now 9k but I doubt myself more everytime

If you do have a photo ID I'd suggest buying from somewhere that requires it then sending it to a wallet in which you don't need to but I'm not from Canada so I that's the best advice I can give
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:42:39
Not disagreeing but what's your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:41:43
Do you mean it was a correction? if so I get your point, if not please elaborate
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:10:35
Go to dollars, much easier to keep track of news etc
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:53:19
I feel like the market will correct it's self regardless of whale's actions, Bitcoin has strong community backing (although the fork may change that)
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:02:56
Surely by then BTC would have settled down. And a new leader would be rising (not taking over but approaching)
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:08:51
Maybe take some out and drastically reduce your mortgage so you can hold some extra or just save up and re-buy?
Also is Bitcoin mining profitable anymore I feel as if it's just not worth it(at least mining from home)
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:10:17
I was told the fork was happening in 9 days from now but in fairness I haven't heard anything about it not being 100% certain
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:49:56
Well... I wasn't expecting any response like this but damn you make a good point and I should have clearly not just summarised Bitcoin with its legacy and that's it. (Also I didn't even know about BTC smart contracts)

Just have trading view opened on my second monitor with an alert for $10k 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:25:45
Such a basic solution yet I didn't think of it....
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:03:37
With futures I only feel like it will become even more volatile generating more risk, the short term future of Bitcoin is based on futures and how well they are handled (IMO)
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:35:51
Yeah, I feel like this growth is in preparation for exactly that
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:04:01
Ah, thank you so much! (I didn't know there has already been a segwit aswell)
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:03:56
I've got a mycelium wallet, how will I receive the segwit2 BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:25:37
This conversation hurts to just imagine

Overall these spikes do tend to drop but eventually go back even higher after a few months/ years
(I'm new so I don't know if that's accurate what so ever)
