Yeah just what i thought.  More BS from the Dipshits....
@_date: 2016-10-13 06:53:43
The Bitcoin community = Gman and the Dipshits... In BlockKoreas Core
@_date: 2016-10-13 06:49:09
The Bitcoin community is asking it... Not some outsiders

Excellent news. The only thing that's worrying me is you can buy a lot of food with 5 dollars there. I'm not sure they'll want to pay another 5 dollars to move 1 dollar... You know what i mean?
@_date: 2016-10-08 11:11:37
So this could be implemented after all 21 mil bitcoins are mined?
@_date: 2016-10-01 14:16:27
11K and you don't own the Keys? Maybe this'll teach you bruv.
@_date: 2016-10-13 06:46:21
So there was no agreement but somehow the miners violated it...

Lol. This is like my 55th username. No ban at all :)))
@_date: 2016-10-15 11:35:33
Lol. Trolls be trolls i guess. You fail to come up with a response so you just go with bashing the other guy. Way to go Trump. My writing has nothing to do with the fact that both SegWit and LN are not ready for prime time. It's a fact. Go cry and let Gman and Co. tell you how to live your life :) now please go and delete your account kid

Ok Factman. Lol
@_date: 2016-10-13 10:36:49
My man
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:22:19
Watched some of your videos and you looked like a smart guy... what happened?  You on BlockKorea payroll?
@_date: 2016-10-08 14:01:10
Thank you for that.
@_date: 2016-10-13 08:12:37
I am still amazed that the community followed Cores plan, which is a bunch of papers and no Code. There's SegWit which is already late and now we'll have to wait another 5 years for LN... How did we go from Code to Politics is beyond me. BlockKorea better get it's shit together and stop playing politic games. This is Code Country!!!
@_date: 2016-10-06 18:57:49
Long live the seed
@_date: 2016-10-13 10:44:33
Is there code for LN?
@_date: 2016-10-13 18:03:52
Definitely looks.like a ready to roll solution for scaling.
@_date: 2016-10-13 09:29:35
Lol 0.25 :)) you made my day man. We're down from 20 mb to 1.25mb. It's hilarious....
@_date: 2016-10-13 06:49:48
Those dipshits... Nobody fucks with Gman
@_date: 2016-10-13 16:50:17
Well, that's just like, your opinion man
@_date: 2016-10-14 18:14:39
Ok so i took a look thru the code from SegWit and LN. My conclusion is that they are NOT ready for rollout... So, i don't think my question was stupid.  LN is a LONG way from actual usability and SegWit is rushed code. They are both needed don't get me wrong, but they're not ready. My 2 cents... this could srsly go bad. I hope your heroes ,Gman and his dishits, will not rush bad code just to.prove a point. If they do, we all go down...
@_date: 2016-10-15 11:40:06
Seen all of them and i'm dissapointed that there was no Hard Fork talk?!!? During the Scaling Bitcoin Conference?!!? I guess well have to do it ourselves. Great talks guys. Keep up the good work
@_date: 2016-10-13 10:51:11
Wuhuuuuu. We've waited what? 2 years for SegWit to bring a 0.35 mb increase :)) so much wowww
@_date: 2016-10-15 17:14:42
Yeah i don't see any banning on this sub. Why is there an *alternative* forum I wonder?
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:32:35
Maybe you should learn to read between the lines
