I feel that everyone here needs to take a look at this. 
There are some things that I feel is very important for people to review. There is information regarding many of the topics in discussion with the most recent announcement.

Let me just say I do think that Bifinex is working in everyone interest here to bring up the exchange again. I think the plan laid out can actually work, but there must be some checks in place before proceeding. 
There are some information here that everyone also should review. 
"Solvent voluntary liquidation" After restructuring the debt using "Creditors Arrangements" might be one interesting possibility that we should be cautious of and demand more transparency among investor accounts and creditors. 
Last thing we want is Bitfinex making deals with investors with secure debt and socialing the cost of the rest of the members by restructuring then doing through the liquidation anyways by cutting out the unsecured creditors. Terms of iou's and terms of any possible voluntary liquidation after resolution must be in place. 
It may be possible that some are getting iou's and some are getting private equity in the company during this adjustment period. This must be done with with some type of arbitrator.  
This is just the tip of things. There are many more topics of interest to discuss prior to anyone agreeing to anything just yet. 
I love what Bitfinex has put forth as possible resolution and I want to make it work. But only way it will work for everyone is if there is complete transparency. Since Bitfinex prides themselves as being most transparent exchange I hope this will be a none issue going forth. 
CREDITORS ARRANGEMENTS
A creditors' arrangement (‘CA”) is a procedure which enables a company to compromise liabilities with creditors. It is similar to a company voluntary arrangement under the English Insolvency Act 1986. A CA is flexible and can vary or cancel debts. A CA cannot affect the rights of secured or preferential creditors without their written consent.

This is the most rational solution imo, as long as they will be forthcoming with their financial standing in the future announcements. 
I'm speaking from a point of view of someone who had unaffected usd in exchange account.

It does state on the announcement, "The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until redeemed in full by Bitfinex or possibly exchanged—upon the creditor’s request and Bitfinex’s acceptance—for shares of iFinex Inc. " 
So I think they can be turned into shares. It remains unclear how at this time.

I forgot to add that i'm not giving any legal advice, I'm just linking information here for people to raise the right questions

Some info regard the legality of things that might be helpful. 
One of important being restructuring the debt and possible preferential treatment to certain creditors. And how that might affect the possibility of voluntary insolvency after restructuring. This needs to be discussed fully imo before accepting the terms of the token scheme.

When I said it didn't return to my account balance on Kraken immediately, I was trying to explain that since the money has never left Kraken in route to my bank account, they should credit my kraken account with USD withdrawal amount that was cancelled. 
Seems that after searching for other issues with withdrawal with Kraken, I found more cases of withdrawals being held and not being processed and holding customer funds without response to tickets. People should be aware if the exchange is having issues letting people withdraw.

The money never was sent out to my bank. I've actually have larger withdrawals sent without issues in the past and it's domestic US to US transfer. It was stuck in processing with Kraken the entire time and not sent out over 9 days. Which is why is even more upsetting that when this withdrawal was cancelled on their website, the money didn't immediately returned back to the balance on the account.
