I think this bloody market is the result of the coming Bakkt. The cheaper price - the more btc inverstors will buy. This bloody bath is for THEM) just be patient!

Halving means - you divide to the half of present btc reward - from 12.5 btc to 6.25 in late spring 2020
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:58:04
Foundmental laws + manipulations = 1 spring pump in whole year! 
@_date: 2018-12-01 07:10:45
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:24:08
I just hope its not a grave)))
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:22:15
This chart shows that the higher price - the lower reward
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:18:30
so next stop on green island should be about 40 000 $, may be 50K$
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:15:07
Sounds very bright and optemistic! Well, i'm in!))
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:44:55
I think if someone see no difference b/w btc and scam coins - 2019 - will become the final year of "investing" in crypto ...
@_date: 2018-12-01 07:56:53
Sorry. These colors means months before halving
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:38:10
That shows when the reward for BTC minning will be divided and will become a half from nowdays
@_date: 2018-12-01 23:23:51
It shows 6000$ ... 
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:50:40
I just dont want people to think we are living in a fairy tale ... we can have a lot of problems through the new 2019 ... to have 2-3 good pumps in 2019 will be good result!
