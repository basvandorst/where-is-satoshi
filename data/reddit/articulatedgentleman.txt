Where exactly is the difficulty in automatically condensing anything beyond the last X blocks into a ledger.
It could easily be verified via block-stamped hashes and modifying the value of X would be trivial so as to allow for nodes with longer/full transaction history.
While I'm not well acquainted with the code behind bitcoin, unless it's a complete mess it should be relatively trivial to implement such a ledger as a form of blockchain compression.
Anything less is lazy programming, especially when an entire financial system is concerned.

It'll level out shortly around $195 on Mt. Gox and then sharply break (not sure which way).

EDIT2: If the downward trend resumes I'm selling and going to sleep.  Right now it looks like another hiccup in the new uptrend.

100,000,000/~10,000,000 = 10

They used to have a horribly slow website (now fixed).
Only complaint now is the 30 day hold on BTC withdrawals if you use Dwolla for the first time.
Other than that I've had no trouble with them at all, plus they're a bit cheaper than coinbase.

They're smart enough to wait for the price to bottom out before they start piping money into it.

Whenever the price stops going up there's instantly more incentive to spend them than to save them and people will gradually start doing so until the price starts going up again.
@_date: 2013-06-02 18:55:45
The only case I can think of that possibly happening is in the case of a critical failure on the part of an exchange, crashing the price to $10 only on that exchange and having a weaker effect on the true price / price at other exchanges.

I recommend looking into bitcoin payment processors such as bitpay so you can accept bitcoin without exposing yourself to risk (they immediately convert to USD).
Although pretty much everyone here is of the mind that the price of bitcoin will in the long run continue going through the roof.  Personally I think they'll hit at least $100K each for a market cap of around 2 trillion.

I think it more likely that another protocol will supersede bitcoin from being built off of and backed by it while simultaneously improving upon and thus obsoleting parts of the standard.
Limited blockchain clients would be a very basic example of what I think will happen to a greater extent in the future.

In order to automate reactions to human psychology there would be levels of AI required that are far beyond what's possible with today's technology.
The idea of an AI run economy is definitely an interesting point since AI could be designed with only an incentive to maximize public good (or whatever your ethical system advocates for) as opposed to satisfying self-interested wants.

While it would be a huge short term disruption the pool operators would probably organize pretty quickly to fork to fork the blockchain and reject any work done by the dominating entity.
Pretty sure there's a bitcoin fork that already figured out how to do that effectively.

Depending on how you look at it with the expected rate of difficulty increase and price you're either making a solid return on USD or you're wasting your BTC.

Bitcoin can always be modified.
There's also the possibility of producing an alternate coin by sending bitcoins to a black hole address that while valid for receiving coins is not generated with a private key to access the coins.
@_date: 2013-04-21 02:10:50
If anything it will drive up the price because more mining power = higher mining difficulty = greater cost to produce bitcoin = higher asking price for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:21:41
Bought at $232, sold at $85.
Going to be watching the prices closely tonight when Mt. Gox goes back up.
Either things are going to continue spiking like crazy or we're in for another big slump.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:16:02
It may crash lower yet if what we're seeing is a "dead cat bounce".
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:14:49
Yep, and that's it, they can only see it went from one address to another, except you're limiting that to the mixer as opposed to the entire network.

This is exactly why I didn't invest in ASIC-MINER after not having the cash to get in on the IPO.

Good, should keep the price a little lower for when I get the chance to buy more tomorrow.

While creating such a network is feasible, bitcoin is not of such a nature.

In the case that GPUs become irrelevant there's still plenty of opportunity for more grouping together on funding things like ASICMiner (publicly traded ASIC mining operation).

For now I'm sticking to investing in things I'm certain will stick around until I have more cash then I reasonably need.
If ASIC-MINER ever shows up on a properly regulated stock exchange then I'll buy without fears of it disappearing.
For now, others can profit on the uncertainty I share with anyone else who's wary of trading on an unregulated exchange.

There are no fool proof mechanisms when anyone can freely create as many identities (addresses) as they want.
A web of trust based system could accomplish something closer to what it seems you're looking for.  In that case it'd be identity thieves working against the network who'd benefit instead of people working to support the network for everyone.
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:28:38
It would allow them to control the blockchain until a fix was implemented.
A fix is definitely possible but it'd still crash the price sharply in the short term.
Since bitcoins being worth less is not good for people mining bitcoins, they have a very strong incentive to not mess with the blockchain.

Very quick to get money in through Dwolla, though they do put a 30 day hold on BTC withdrawals if you use it (helps them counter fraudsters).
You'll also need to do some identity verification for legal purposes if you want to top $1,000 in per day.
Other than that, since their server upgrade it's been very smooth to use.  Also very nice that they aren't currently in any legal hot water unlike other exchanges.  They do their best to be prepared for all legal/regulatory purposes.

Unfortunately greed is much more predictable in how it acts than in how it is acted out.
The sheer number of different ways greed can be obfuscated and hidden is too immense to easily detect.
It becomes a contest of who's got more brainpower and skill to devote to detecting/obfuscating hidden intentions.

They're just middlemen to the transfer of value out of USD and into BTC.  Every time someone buys BTC with USD they are stating that they value that amount of BTC more than the USD they spent on it.  Repeat that enough times and it makes BTC worth something.  Going up orders of magnitude it would noticeably inflate USD.

Pointless unless you have serious capital and exclusive exchange rates.
Look for another spike and minicrash in the next few days though if you want to get some day trading in.
