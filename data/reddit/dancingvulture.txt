No one can can give a exact date or guesstimate so it could be in a years time or in 100 years time,you cannot argue this point I just made.So its something at this stage that has no practical use in the real world for even simple day to day tasks like buying groceries.It is volatile and unpredictable,how long has bitcoin been around and you cant buy groceries with it directly?

How many people who bought bitcoin are actually owned by bitcoin?Seems like a lot of people spend every waking moment watch the price of bitcoin,surely all the stress and anxiety must take its toll on health and relationships?

How will/can bitcoin be adopted/used in third world countries where people battle to survive?How will bitcoin overcome cultural stumble blocks in the way of wide scale adoption?Would the volatility in its price not also be a stumbling block for the everyday man in the street if he had the option of bitcoin being used to pay his paycheck?Informal traders in Africa will never use it as a currency,it's not practical.

Mass adoption was needed asap and this is a crisis now,what date will mass adoption happen and how?

If a woman was as moody/volatile and unstable as bitcoin would you enter into a long term relationship with her?

Percentage wise what figure of the world population/world's currency do you see being converted and on what do you base your numbers and what is the time frame?

Seriously,how many of you have either used bitcoin to buy lambos or know people who have as a result of bitcoin riches?Lastly what has any of you bought on a regular basis in the real world using bitcoin?Surely implementation starts with its defenders?Seems like Stockholm Syndrome is rife here.

The world is in a recession,people don't have excess money lying around to save nevermind invest in bitcoin.The odds are stacked against this social experiment,in tech and in practical application.Dec people wont be using their work bonus on bitcoin but rather be saving it or service debt.If bitcoin is the future and mass adoption is going to happen then why arent there even a million people on this sub?bitcoin is like a terminal patient,it has it's good days but then just sinks back and gets weaker.Time to be honest and say your goodbye.Most decisions made here are out of greed not good financial principles,if they were none would buy bitcoin.There are sadly going to be more losers than winners.

I have never bought bitcoin in my life,just a interested bystander asking some questions.

Thanks for the reply.

It won't work in places with unstable electricity infrastructure.You take 10% away from a 1 man salary that often feeds more than one family you have a recipe for a riot.Africa is Africa,don't compare it to other continents.

If you bought cash with bitcoin does that not defeat the purpose of bitcoin?What is 1080Ti?

Who has bought consumables like groceries with bitcoin?No one and no one knows what the price is going to do.

Not every third world country in Africa has hyper inflation.Lack of technology infrastructure even something seemingly basic like having a smartphone will be challenges.Education will be hard where you have different languages and dialects plus the distrust caused by tribalism.

Mass adoption was already needed,how will this be implemented and what is the date thereof?
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:17:06
Some of the biggest industries in Africa is informal,how do they convert their customers who aren't even spending a dollar at a time to convert to bitcoin?A lot of African countries don't have hyperinflation.I battle to see mass global adoption.
