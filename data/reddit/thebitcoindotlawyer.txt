But if I wrote a virus and posted it on github, and someone used it to steal from a hot wallet, I can be sued and prosecuted.

I hope they submit their BIP like everyone else

What do you mean, destroy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:10:40
We could have a Bitcoin reality TV show.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:55:53
Good point. Consider, however, that hard forking is an affirmative act which may cause foreseeable harm. Anyone can do whatever they want, but may end up paying for the harm they caused.

Thank you for this idea

The law is reactive. Try telling a court that they have no power to render a judgment because Bitcoin is immutable. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:31:28
Very nice. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with me.

Let me give some background. First of all, I'm a noobie here. My original observations invoke simultaneous feelings of awe and awfulness. Members of this subreddit post some of the most prudent, well-written, sophisticated writings within the forms. However, a few threads quickly devolve into partisan-grade animosity. 
How much time, energy, and hardship would we save, by omitting all ad hominem arguments within the forums? 
What if we ended all ad hominem arguments in society?
I think the ad hominem fallacy (unrelated, personal attacks on others) poses the greatest threat to our societal discussions today.
It's natural. We become so impassioned by our opinions, I become upset when other people don't see the world through my eyes. E.g. Righteousness to me isn't necessarily righteousness to you. 
Besides, the beauty of the Bitcoin movement is that we don't need to centralize existential questions. Many alternatives are mutually inclusive. Mutually exclusive questions can be decided by the markets. 
The Bitcoin ecosystem can cleanse itself, without us polluting it.

Do we risk a replay regardless of which coin we choose to send?
Also, can your method be improved by pushing the 2x coins to a third address within our control?
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:37:18
I agree that bigger blocks will decrease decentralization. It's intuitive that block size correlates with centralization. But I fail to see how anyone can destroy Bitcoin by pushing for bigger blocks? 
I'm assuming that bigger blocks require a hard fork. (Please correct me if I'm wrong).  If so, no one is requiring you or I to go along with the hard fork. We may simply sell the coins with bigger blocks. Bitcoin may lose market share, but not nearly enough to threaten its existence nor viability. 
If the big blockers are destroying Bitcoin by spurring debate, no problem there either. In the free market of ideas, better ideas usually win. If bigger blocks are a better idea, why not allow that idea to prevail?
Lastly, if a large portion of hashing power migrates to a Segwit 2x chain—or BCH chain—how would this destroy Bitcoin? Although the 2016 blocks could take months to mine, the difficulty will eventually readjust. Further, economic incentives will drive new miners into the field (i.e. Russia). 
Lastly, if the big blockers threaten to destroy Bitcoin by persuading the majority of users to migrate to their chain, so what? They have not destroyed Bitcoin, but merely redefined it.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:31:01
Of course I think banning bitcoin is a bad idea. I'm just worried that if the US banned bitcoin, the price would take a major hit.

Generally, freedom of speech only protects against the government (state action requirement). In other words, free speech protects Jeff from being jailed, not sued. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:43:06
Or they can simply make Bitcoin illegal to own, accept, or trade.

Are you sure your electricity rates are not tiered? I.e. rates increase based on overall usage?
I’d recommend buying the coin, or buying one miner and working up from there. Sometimes household electricity infrastructure simply cannot handle the mining. Even if the structure in particular is outfitted for it.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:42:56
Why are you opposed to doctors and lawyers?
Keeping blocks at the current limit cannot constitute trespass to chattels because there is no affirmative act upon which to establish liability.
At most, you can argue negligence, which requires a duty to act, and a breach of that duty. 
Legal arguments aside, consider culpability. Spamming the network has the intent to cause harm to network participants. 
People with bona fide beliefs who argue for any block size are not intending to cause harm to others. 
By blaming small blockers, you are blaming the victims of the spam attacks. Attacks which are currently costing 5 bitcoins every ten minutes. 
What are your thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:59:10
The Intel court held that spam itself was insufficient, unless the spam causes delays, damage, or some other harm to the personal property.  
Yes, the California Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court, which means it is not direct precedent, yet it is persuasive dicta. Do you agree?
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:59:53
What do you mean? Legal systems will always get involved. There is no alternative. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:48:28
I think you're correct. But here in California, we have very strong assumption of risk doctrines. Nevertheless, I'd argue that if Coinbase sold its cold storage for Bcash, that would qualify as reckless. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:48:48
I think she would have to recuse herself, even assuming she's in charge of decision making (I think the Commissioners decide the appeal). Am I correct?

1) How well do you think Mr. Dimon knows Bitcoin?
2) Do you think he will actually fire employees who trade bitcoin?

I agree that the next recession can be wildly different, and unlike anthing we've ever seen before. Can you play out a plausible scenario in which the dollar falls during a recession?

This is absolutely beautiful. Did you see that the bill is only three pages? Very simple, and helpful legislation. I expect the final form will contain much more pork and complexity. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:06:34
To the contrary. In recessions, people sell their assets, pushing up the demand—and therefore value—of the dollar. 
The most we can hope for is that bitcoin serves the same purpose as the dollar: a liquid asset for capital to flee into. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:42:02
That's sad that the purpose of the SEC is to protect investors, yet they can only buy a $15k bitcoin through this closed end fund.
