common us policy

Sorry, in the modern civilization you dont focus so much on death machines. There are way better things in life, than weapons and warfare. But sure buddy. The us is the best, greatest, mightiest, wealthiest country in the world. Thank you for your service.
The us is such a bad country, i was never there. There is simply nothing in the us better, than anywhere else.
Stolen land, stolen culture, fat people and if you dont take care, you‘ll get shot by a insane civilian or even the police, if you are a person of color.
So just gtfo usa

idk which argument you talking about. your gun seems essential to you, which is fair enough. where i live, i dont need a gun, because our asshole coefficient is much lower than in liberal-gun-law nations.   
i recommend you use that gun.

thats why they are leaving (if they ever do). in times of cryptocurrency, nation states are outdated.

elvis has left the building
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:05:49
since they are already controlling the price and demand.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:18:49
thats really a good thing in the us. maybe more us citizens get shot, so the world will be a better place.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:55:45
you say you are invite only. why do you promote yourself here? seems very scammy...  
also, coinbase may be the mainstream, but in the scene, coinbase has a rough standing. i dont get why you compare yourself literally with coinbase, but dont provide international service.

the gamers dont play anymore, they are all on discords, reddits and youtube as crypto[randomnick] advisers, stealing 50$ from daddys creditcard and making the huge investments to buy a lambo
