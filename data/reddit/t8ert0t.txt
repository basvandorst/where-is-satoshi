Jeez.

Yeah. I took a peak and that's not really it. More about just dispersing coins into multiple wallets/transactions.

This is where Ethereum or Monero are going to dust it.

Curious, what about Litecoin or Monero? Granted, the transaction volume is far less, but doesn't eithet one have "better bones" to support that kind of volume?

This is for invoicing though. Point of sale systems and online vendors take credit cards and debit that post within days. Starbucks or a gas station isn't going to invoice you on a net 30.

I can see your grandfather stashing a hard wallet I that thing and then always making weird comments like
There's always money in Bitcoin, yknow.

I finally got on gdax. Look at the price differential from coinbase to gdax in real time. CB ganks you, hard.

I'm not too keen on having to put a deposit down on a payment channel with an initial vendor and tie up funds. 
Also, aren't vendors going to want to close out the ledger on the channel asap?  I feel like vendors will always want to close out the channel, so wouldn't this create a similar bottleneck with vendors trying to reconcile funds as quickly as possible to ensure they make it onto the blockchain? 
I think this is where Monero or Ethereum are going to succeed and best BTC in the not-so-distant future.

When it's less prone to volatility.

Pretty much. It's pretty ironic the thing it was designed for doesn't attract people to it. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:19:26
Big, if true.

I usually ask people if they would choose getting the rest of this year's paychecks in bitcoin. Not many have said yes.

Isn't this just like a stock split where you get two shares of lesser value?

This plus relational pricing/volatility.
If I asked you how much gas or a gallon of milk costs in your default currency without looking up current prices, you'd have a pretty good ballpark based on your experience with the good and how your currency performs month to month. 
If I asked you what the Bitcoin price of a gallon of milk was 6 months ago, and then made you answer today, both without looking, it's gonna get weird.

Wired had a great 2 (or 3?) part story of the investigation and arrest.
