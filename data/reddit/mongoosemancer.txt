I agree. Crypto is weird in that, it's undervalued and overvalued at the exact same time if that makes sense. It has the real potential to break the system, send the banks scrambling, and to jumpstart a more community driven economy and at the same time people are just using it to churn out more mainstream government backed currencies because that's what's safe. The only reason BTC is so hyped up is because of how many Real dollars it's worth, and that's cool but it's also counter to the original idea and the big picture.

Well I'm just gonna abandon ship with this conversation before it seems like an argument, because honestly I agree with you. I do not see BTC as the future and it gets a little annoying seeing the 19 year old armchair finance wizards talk about their future billions. I get where your frustration is coming from.. But you do see my point that nobody REALLY knows right? It's showing the same historic trends that have been seen time and time again that always led to a collapse, but we live in a weird time where things that SHOULD happen don't. I'm just not too surprised by anything any more that's all.

Nobody really knows. I'm not gonna say you're wrong, you may very well be correct. Or maybe you're way off, y9ur arrogance is a little offputting but besides that you may be right :)

The majority of people treat it like a stock that will magically generate them money lol. A lot of these people were right too, but bitcoin became something entirely different than what it was originally intended for and I'm not being negative, I think it's a good thing for the longevity of the crypto, but there are many peaks and valleys to come. I don't think we are anywhere near the collapse OR the $100k per mark.

I don't even care if it dies or not tbh I'm just saying nobody knows. You asserting your knowledge-less opinions with anger and resentment doesn't make you a genius financial analyst just so ya know lol.

You're right. I know the difference, I wasn't necessarily confusing them so much as I was just using the wrong terminology. But yes, you're right.
