Wow this is a great app, both for investing and learning some crypto through referrals!!!
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:10:00
I saw it but wasn't aware that cryptograffiti did it with old credit cards, amazing analogy ����

Well my friend, I agree we're enslaved by our government, but going to prison is not going to help my kids go to college. I wish we could choose on that same as with insurance, but what are gonna do, it beats outright banning of cryptocurrency at least.

That's completely ok, all revolutions must come with some casualties ��

For any of you who haven't done it before, I highly recommend to read a book about Elon written by Ashlee Vance, one of the best books I ever read
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:24:02
So when it will be available to general public and for what price?
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:11:10
True, especially if he invested without going too deep into the fundamentals, he is a businessman in the first place, right.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:18:45
Blockstream should be a good place to start right? I'm asking around on how to start running the note and use zap wallet, any suggestions?
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:09:51
Not crypto, I have a side gig and crypto as well, crypto is the fuel to stay on top of the 2 shitjobs I look to get out of

There are so many people that fortunately have both quit with some of the nasty habits they had and invested in their future accordingly at the same time, so much for the criticism about how Bitcoin is Drug Money, prostitutes and similar stuff
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:35:48
Did you get to quit eventually? God I wish I was strong enough to do it myself, that's probably the best investment you can make independently of the final outcome
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:25:51
I really don't get the guy, if he stayed in Bitcoin he would be respected and loved by the entire community, what else do you need, how much more money will be enough
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:05:35
As long as he stays enthusiastic, he is the gen that's coming to take the fruits of all the developmemts and steady hands of hodlers! :)
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:49:37
Oh man, I got nothing against any political views especially not libertarian, what I am against is the expression of those views he has
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:47:13
I agree, that's why I support this technology in the first place, taxes are here to stay, but if get official institutions on public blockchains no one will mind paying taxes. I'm happy as long as they don't ban it, at least for now. In the long run, I wish we all get to choose the way we feel about these things.  
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:10:56
I don't understand why the man keeps on showing up, he must be some kind of a hardcore masochist to be able to listen to this all the time
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:26:01
He went public now, but sold at 20k, apparently he said it was too stressful for him to see track the price and keep up with FUD and volatility. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:29:49
Well it's not just about people, it's also about biggest transaction volume third parties like i.e. Coinbase, that still haven't implemented it. But they will pretty soon, they said in a couple of weeks in their last announcement on that topic :)
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:39:43
I bought at 14k since that was the dip when we reached 20k, but I also bought at 6k a couple days back, and bought at 2k last year. So if you do the math, I'm still good ��
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:46:52
 he probably meant gdax
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:16:16
Nope, I think they're still in the development phase, I'm on their telegram chat and things are very slow. We'll get there eventually I guess
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:37:42
Exactly my point, but most of the people are right, those are just excuses for my own weakness terms of the nasty habit I have developed. I I would like to thank everyone for their support and advices, I might just start thinking more towards that goal off quitting it and investing all the money into crypto
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:49:28
There will be more platforms this year that will enable that users to hedge their crypto against another crypto or traditional derivative, and I think that in case those proved to be positive on the stability of the market, ETFs might kick in. But doubtfully in 2018.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:07:03
It wasn't about money at all, it would benefit if he did, but this way he has great price averaging and full lungs of O2 ��
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:26:57
I sold the thing the first day I got it after the fork, financially that was the worst possible move to make, but I have zero regrets
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:34:51
Thanks for the tip, my best friend did them, says they burn like hell and after a week he got stuck in traffic somewhere and could handle it lol 
It's very hard for a trucker to quit, what else am I going to think about when driving through WY desert��
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:14:36
True, it was a great opportunity, though all the new money obviously needs more institutional recognition in order to feel more confidence for holding when times are rough. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:01:37
And we must use the vanitygen to create a custom one like 1Ghodl....��
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:24:21
Does cointracking.info works the same way, by uploading .csv files and what is their transaction maximum before you need to pay, I think for .tax was 50. Also, there's a website 21.tax as well, have you tried that one? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:20:11
IDK, still on the road, I'm looking to try later tonight and write the steps for people that are interested in trying as well :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:57:04
I tried doing them, burns my tongue and troath and I always go back to regular, I guess cold turkey is the most hardcore but yet the most efficient way since it takes the most guts to try that way. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:21:44
Can't I do it on windows? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:34:36
Man, then that's definetelly not the stuff for me unless you guys want to see GTA play out in the real world lol 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:21:17
Him and Kenn Bosak did a great interview ��
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:40:20
Although if you are truly libertarian, you should endorse the freedom of speech and expression, which defacto is not doing at all considering that it's forbidden to label his coin as bcash
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:28:02
As someone stuck in a job I don't like, and have money to change oil when I need to, I'd say take you chances, never settle until you're happy with what you do! Whenever I'm off work I study and do other thinks, hoping I'll turn hobby into everyday job ��
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:03:04
If I recall, I think he bought a ton at 700 back in the day, so yeah, wouldn't mind being him. Although, why be stressed out, you're still doing great even at 7k
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:45:43
Huh, well I might just try that, the only thing is I don't need any side effects while I'm behind the wheel so I'll think about it pretty damn good, but thanks ��
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:35:57
So I read about the tech behind it, learn more and give less fuck about what bailout cartel has to say, simple.

So great! I can't wait to start running one this weekend!

My good friend invests his cigarette money on a daily basis, he pays the fees but it's a good motive to quit smoking
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:37:59
Agreed, but I think taxation is unfortunately a good entry level in the US, since if you can use it to pay taxes that means it is recognized as a legal tender, although I suppose that many taxpayers will not use crypto for that purpose, it's still opposite than banning it.   
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:06:31
I have tested bitcoin.tax and it was very easy thing to do, however I have no idea if the numbers add up properly. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:20:31
Time in the market always beats timing it, also been there last summer, since then, I'm hodling   no matter what!
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:04:47
Veeery hard, besides doing crypto I'm a truck driver, so two jobs demanding a good smoke at all times lol ��
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:36:58
That goes without question, I buy only three dips - BTC, ETH &amp; LTC
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:23:09
I do not understand much of what anyone above is saying...but what I do not understand even more is, why we divided as a community expect that crypto and blockchain can succeed? Bitcoin has always had so many outside enemies and has and would fight them all bravely, unless we as supporters, adopters, nodes, miners and developers don't destroy it first...I'm all for tech and upgrades, but this time and in this situation, I think unity is what we need before anything else. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:06:10
And as the author said, for some reason the best improvements and proposals usually happened when the price dipped -

I bet those newspaper owners thought the same think when internet came by. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:40:53
Always buy the dip down, even if it goes lower you get the price averaging that's mighty good long term!

I know which study is that, it's called "Fundamentals of financial freedom - Inovation without permission"
