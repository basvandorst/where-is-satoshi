Or they buy more and more coins and have a bigger effect every time. The fuck is wrong with some of you?
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:09:22
They are just incompetence personified with a heavy dose of don't give a fuck. The operators should be laughed out of the industry, period.
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:30:29
Because you are trying to guess when the market will drop even though you expect it to rise long term. The smart play is to buy then buy again on the drop if that is the case.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:54:28
You seem lost. 
Short market on margin.
Cash out $50,000,000 in USD worth of real Bitcoin.
You get $50,000,000 USD and your short position is now worth a fortune too. 
A stop loss at break even on the short would more than suffice as you would rake it the fuck in.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:24:35
Terminology was apt, losing $1 or $1,000,000 over some bullshit is bigger bullshit.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:33:41
Dude, you are watching a tiny ass piece of the market since off exchange transactions don't show you shit. If someone wants 50 million in BTC today they will NOT go buy that shit on GDax.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:10:56
Again, you are trying to understand cryptocurrency by comparing it to the stock market when the only thing they have in common is that exchanges are used to trade. There are a million variables that do not effect regular stocks that can have a huge impact on cryptocurrency prices. Further, far more people can trigger these events than a few ultra rich traders / companies with billions in stock.
I don't care where the price goes but your are a nut.
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:28:52
Yep, and this time make sure it's a move into even more regulated territory to finish painting in that big ass bulls-eye of incompetence.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:06:03
You are a fucking moron.
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:04:25


ignoring the practical problem that virtually no one will accept it
at first, there is still a difficulty in coming up with a reasonable
argument in favor of a particular non-zero value for the coins.
The value of a new currency is directly proportionate to how bad someone wants pizza and finding someone to buy said pizza. This sets the price which will then double every 5 years based on my analysis. As you can see BTC is several deviations from the mean.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:07:25
I don't care. They could have done it off exchange but fuck it. If this ends with more people holding Bitcoin it is good.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:03:27
And what will they do with the extra money?
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:15:42
Yeah gambling against a 1.xx% adoption rate on something that is currently sweeping the world by storm "keeps it grounded". 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:51:38
Bitcoin price - $0.
Bitcoin price - $8600.

First of all, I use Bitcoin.
Second, I bought my first coins at $60 and my second round at $300. When did you start, when Bitcoin hit the news for going to 10k?

Why would some people pay 2% and not have to control keys vs keeping up with 50 wallets, forks, fees and fuckery?
Gee Wally, I dunno!
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:11:22
They cleared a billion last year, if they pass on any fees on top of their absurd prices they are worse than expected.
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:31:18
Between confiscated unclaimed property, holding funds until some give up, hundreds of millions in investor money and a billion? a year in profit I'm sure these dipshits have a nice little stash tucked away somewhere. Would be a real shame if this "legal exchange" that is supposed to save Bitcoin is the main reason we get regulated out of participating. 
If the 3 letter agencies don't have a file opened on Coinbase by now they will in the near future. The level of incompetence they display is criminal.

My most successful trade anywhere was buying EUR / USD during the run up and holding for 2 years on margin. 
My least successful trade was thinking a chart would tell me where a price would end up.
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:13:39
Not reading on my phone but probably unclaimed property is what they meant. They would be able to find and claim it.
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:31:14
It's not my fault the MtGox whale waited for the charts to align with the selloff of millions of dollars in BTC. It's the law, and once you accept this you can accurately predict the market with candles and skateboard ramps.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:39:32
What you call user error isn't typical user error. Companies spend piles and piles of money to make sure such stupid simple things are taken care of where someone can't lose money in such a ridiculous way.

@_date: 2018-03-07 03:21:22
Not interested in the_donald talking points. I'd rather the money get distributed in accordance with the law vs Coinbase stealing it on top of millions of other dollars that do not belong to them.

Are you dense?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:16:16


Did your magic 8 ball tell you that? 
And I guess your gut told you when a creditor would be dumping BTC in droves? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:13:48
And here is my advice to Satoshi.


available cycles, consuming electricity and generating carbon dioxide,
all over the Internet, in order to produce small amounts of bitbux to

Me too after watching TA by Trevon James.
Watch this. BTC to $8200 then back up to $9500. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:12:29
Have you never heard of stop losses? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:15:21
Why do all of you project your fears onto others? 
I DGAF where Bitcoin price ends up. I believe in it **long fucking term**. It is an opportunity, probably the only one in my life, to get into something so insanely massive near the bottom. $40, $400, $4000 and $20000 are all interchangeable as the "bottom" in this regard.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:59:40
Hey idiot, I know how the law works. I was stating that creditors would come out ahead with BTC vs getting cash value and some government or another keeping the rest.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:46:33
We might, but not because you predicted it based on voodoo, investing course sales pitches and gut feelings.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:04:55
The fuck would regulation do? What do you want to regulate "yeah, you own too much so you can't sell it"?

@_date: 2018-02-18 10:42:14
Just as you can go to bed salty that since you discovered Bitcoin you missed a chance to turn $100 into $750,000 then $100 into $500,000, then $100 into $300,000, then $100 into $100,000, etc. 
Surely you'll be right about the doom stick one day though!
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:18:31
Not always but you can check for unclaimed money whenever you want. I know for fact that once someone dies California (and I'm sure all others) will notify their heirs and auction off the property to divide up.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:16:11
Very dumb statements. Mend your brain.
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:13:50
All / most states are like this, you don't remember the damn commercials man? 
And again, if they complained it is because Coinbase wouldn't give them their money when they asked. If Coinbase wants to call it "abandoned" there are laws in place that don't = "hahaha we get to keep this shit!"
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:26:12
I haven't looked into this whole thing because I hate Coinbase with a passion but when someone says they should have given it to California I would assume it means on their behalf. If you go look up unclaimed property you'll see people with 500 uncashed royalty checks and such, they can claim them at any time for so many years before the state maybe can have it? Not 100% but still doesn't belong to Coinbase in any way.
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:59:58
There are several companies that specialize in off exchange transactions specifically so some dumbass doesn't sell for less than value by crashing the market on whatever exchange he uses. I think the Winklevoss twins own one even. Also, one of these companies offered their services to the trustee but were disregarded.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:48:27
Treating Bitcoin like a day traded stock is stoopid.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:23:10
Trading on margin without it, a great way to liquidate all of your holdings 5 times faster!

Winklevoss twins.
Case closed.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:08:41
Uh, duh?
And it was dumped on exchanges which are but a fraction of the market but 100% of the "price".
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:13:17
States and the Fed have unclaimed property laws that give you a concise way to collect your property in the future. Coinbase doesn't just get to fucking keep them.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:47:36
If you are saying he did it this way to make money on insider info I agree. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:01:09
Always take trading advice from here. The downward pressure is from one diagonal line being longer than another diagonal line. Once the price gets below this arbitrary horizontal line based on 1 out of 47,503,302 factors it will go down another $1000 at least.
AT LEAST.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:59:56
Dude, it's fucking anonymous if you want it to be. Your argument is so spectacularly dumb that I'm sick of hearing it.
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:46:14
Cryptocurrency is not stock and treating it like the stock market has burned many before you. Tell me, what fundamentals / earnings projections / etc triggered this totally rational bear market that totes can't be flipped into a huge bull run on some good news in any of dozens of countries or just because someone decides to buy a chunk for their business?
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:47:54
If Coinbase gave these guys their money they wouldn't be suing.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:09:40
It's far less than 2% but irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:31:15
OK, well I don't give a damn about all of the residual dips. Day trading stresses me out, period. I think Bitcoin is undervalued and will see more large gains as new announcements float in. If I wanted to gamble short term I'd stick to stocks where a few million dollar buys wouldn't move the market a ton.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:58:32
As long as the "crash" is above where I bought and below where Bitcoin will go it's static.

@_date: 2018-03-08 14:05:46
A billion? Hundreds of millions so far and only a fraction of the holdings that will be liquidated. They could easily go off exchange but that wouldn't let them make their friends rich in the process.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:54:45
Ben reassuring myself since before you read about Bitcoin, will be okay.
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:29:21
Holders are waiting for the moon because they believe in Bitcoin.
Traders could make a profit trading BitConnect coin if they got lucky.


Anyone would be. Now if there were only a way to accurately predict price in a highly volatile market with low trade volume spread across dozens of exchanges instead of one NYSE. 
Hint: There is not.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:07:50

God damn.
Sell 10 million USD in actual coins at 12k.
Use 10 million in BTC to short 50 million on margin. 
You cashed out 10 million, a stop loss on the short locks that in and the crashing price lets you make a fortune on the slide. This is ignoring the low volume on exchanges making a real hard crash steamroll through stop losses and lead to bigger wins and a lot of other factors.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:50:19
What is unrealistic with Bitcoin? 
Are huge companies still HODLing tons of coins? Yep.
Are huge companies still innovating in this space? Yep.
Are I am hodling? Yep.


12 k and 7k they never would have had sitting around trying to ride the charts for years. Most would (and should) have given up. You think this is a game?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:16:50
Anyone trading regularly and not using stop losses is pretty dumb.

Weird, I take it for payments with no trouble.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:16:01
1) It is happening all the time.
2) You are ignoring every single stop loss being wiped out, or at least a chunk of them.
3) It's called an average. If the price starts at 12k of course you won't get 12k.
As it stands someone can go on more than a dozen exchanges right now, put in a sell large enough to crash things and buy the same coins back for less. They can and **do** do this, with and without margin or any other tricks. It has been going on for years.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:43:48
Just going to pretend the network problems and high fees never existed?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:12:51

Unclaimed property laws exist specifically so asshole companies don't just steal everyone's money, something Coinbase has a habit of doing it seems.
Further, you made the political issue with your stupid fucking rant about California and illegal immigration. Immigrants helped build this country into what it is, white nationalist fucksticks who say shit like "based faggot Milo" only hope to destroy it. 
I'm a white ass southerner that grew up in an actual 'hood' and somehow your overprotected suburban ass is the racist. Figure that out.
