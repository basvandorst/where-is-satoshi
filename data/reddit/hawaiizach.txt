Once futures launch 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:59
I hold. Bought in at 1k, 1.5k, 2k, etc. haven’t bought since 9.5k however. It’s getting a bit too pricey. I’ve held through all the dips. I did set aside a few hundred to attempt to trade with (I.e. selling highs and buying dips) - as with most here, I did very well at first then got shat on. I’ve learned this market is way too unpredictable to attempt to game the system.  Now I just hold, and buy when most people are selling. When this rise eventually pops I’ll buy on the way down then throw my coins into my hardware wallet and leave em. I’ve made an insane amount of profit thus far from just holding and buying when people sell. Good luck!

Coinbase holds your apples for you. Since the apples are technically at coinbases house, should coinbases house get broken into you lose your Apples. Or should coin base decide to not send you the apples when you want your apples you are kind of SOL. 
Buying a hardware wallet lets you keep your apples at your house, disconnected from the internet so they can’t be stolen (hacked). 
You aren’t backing up your apples you are moving them.

You're on the money. I agree as well - that's why I said I didn't think we were in a bubble yet. That being said, OP mentioned now is a sell signal because mainstream media is now saying it's great and buy it. It's the beginning stages of a bubble perhaps. And it can be a tiny bubble, doesn't mean the whole thing pops and is worthless. But usually when the masses are getting into something is when it's time to think more strategically about further investing. But yes I agree with you completely. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:55:01

I wanted to buy more when we were at 3400, was waiting for a dip, ended up adding to my pile at 3600. I shoulda just bought at 3400. Pay day always seems to fall on an expensive day in btc land. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:59:26
Which is good and bad, as it means less control via minters but its leading to more centralization. I fear a day only large corporations and entities (banks) can run nodes - defeating the whole purpose of btc.

Key thing here is to keep the majority of your stack on a hw wallet and just keep your trading money on an exchange. Thats a big safety net for many things, and if youre one of the ballsy traders on margin you dont have to worry about your entire stack being margin called if some shenanigans happen like what happened with eth two months ago when people lost millions. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:19:04
Ignore the trolls, thats awesome - your kid is lucky! With only 120 id put it into btc - but in the future put some into the others. Maybe buy yourself a hardware wallet if you dont have one already and set him up with his own address/account on there as well so they are safe. Good luck!

You can use it as much as you want with many different cryptos. Think of it more like it has one private key - when you send btc to it you are just reassigning those btc to the ledgers key. When you send btc to another address from the ledger you're just reassigning the key to whoever you are sending to. Infinite use and storage capabilities. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:41:45
I understand completely. Just playing devils advocate though, if you ask people from 2011-2013 what the biggest mistake they made in crypto was, after saying not buying more, they will say they took security way to lightly. Their coins were only worth a hundred or two, so they didn't bother really digging into securing them. Now, that 100 could have them retiring, and many of them lost those coins. Not saying it will happen to you, just something to think about. Heres a good short video about a guy it happened to:
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:35:36
Ah yes, you again. I'm glad you were so emotionally invested you actually remembered to comment - I'd forgotten about you. Yes, bitcoin cash is at $290 dollars. Worth more than etherium and litecoin. It's bouncing around 300-400 most days, and has seemed to stabilize as much as crypto can - especially brand new crypto. Trading gates opened up, and it was not a dump to zero. And, as it sits right now, unless you make $300 an hour, it's worth a lot more than your hourly wage. That being said, I hope both coins do great as I own both. This whole thread started with me explaining how people can own both coins for no extra cost and you swooping in like the twat you are saying it will be worth nothing so don't waste your time. I'm sure glad I got my bitcoin cash, unlike your advice, because I'm quite a bit richer now and it didn't cost me a cent. Thanks again for commenting I would have completely forgotten about your dumbass statements and how wrong you were LOL!

Ignore all the trolls, haters, and pedantics in here. Great idea - you have a smart kid! I'd strongly recommend a hardware wallet to store them in though, especially since you don't actually "own" your coins on coinbase, and weve seen exchanges fall before, taking user coins with them. Trezor and Nano are great wallets to look into!

He hodled when everyone was fear dumping/selling at the "crash" from $300 to $100,$1,000 to $500, $2500 to $1800, etc. If you want to be financially successful you cannot sell, no matter how shitty things get. I'm sure OP had many "oh shit, it's crashing, im gonna lose my entire portfolio" moments but he held. It's less about buying in early - it's more about having the stones to HODL through all the tough shit. This place was depressing as shit a month ago when we were teetering at $1900 after nearly hitting 3k earlier in the year. I'm sure a shit ton of people sold at massive losses, and I'm also sure a shit ton of people held through it. Lesson of the decade: buy when you can and HODL.

It's taking the old BTC chain with it, which is the reason people holding their own keys will own BCC. This is different than LTC or any other alt. You can call BCC an alt, but it's a hard fork. Stop spreading false info yo.

I'd keep them on one trezor account. Save the other two trezors for quick recovery with your seed words in case your main device breaks or gets lost, etc. you can also set up two as mirror images of themselves by using the seed words from the first device on a second device. This way you can keep a trezor at two locations - both working with your bitcoin on them. The third can be left in packaging as a backup if one gets broken or whatever. I'd go with those two options over splitting my funds over three devices. Just get confusing for no real gain in security. Your seed word storage is the most important part of this - doesn't matter much if a trezor is stolen especially if you use a pass phrase along with pin.

They said that at 1,000 2,000 and now 3,000. Wait long enough and you'll get an opportunity to hop in. Lots of people got it for 1,900 like two weeks ago. You can buy at 3k but history says it will go lower if only for a short time. Moon is coming though - if you don't have time to watch The markets every day just buy in when you can. Buying in at 3,000 vs 2,800 isn't going to really matter when btc is 30,000.

You may be interested in the cash app. It’s similar to Robin Hood in that there are no “fees” but you pay a premium. The cash app is cheapest I believe, you can buy and sell from it, AND you can move your coins to a real wallet if you ever decide to in the future.

Well for starters the price isn’t dropping because people are accidentally “losing” their real bitcoins while selling bitcoin gold. This happens every fork - people move their diverse alts into bitcoin to get free fork coins. After the fork they move some of their bitcoin back into alts. There aren’t even exchanges to sell bitcoin gold yet. It literally just forked. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:14:33
If you are loading up a paper wallet and not touching the coins or adding more any time soon paper is the way to go to save some money. That being said if you want to keep adding more, possibly take stuff off sometimes, etc you want a hardware wallet. It’s pin protected so someone can’t just take your coins like they can with a paper wallet. That being said, if you keep the paper safe you’re fine. 
I will say, setting up a paper wallet is trickier and potentially riskier. Most recommend using a completely reformatted PC that has never seen the internet ever. You also need another PC connected to the internet to process the actual transaction. I won’t go into depth, you can search for solid instructions, but when making a paper wallet you can lose your private key via malware and viruses etc. hardware wallets like trezor can be plugged into the most god awful infected machine and it’s completely safe as all signing is done on the trezor and requires a manual button press to sign. The software can’t sign without you manually pressing the button. Hope I made some sense, and good luck with whatever route you go!
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:46:00
Hardware wallets protect against malware and viruses. They are also pin protected, and the odds of losing your private seed words (which should be stored in more than one location and NEVER just left out under a pillow with no backups like journalist did) and pin together are very small. Writer of this would have probably lost everything and never had it recoverable if he had been using a paper wallet, as he probably would have just left his paper wallet under the pillow instead of his seed words. Then that could have been lost to the trash. 
Also, writers ~~daughter~~ *housecleaner* is also largely at fault. Writer explained he wrote if anything happened to him to take these words to his good friend. Why the hell would ~~daughter~~ *housecleaner* read that and think hmm must be trash? Trezor failed because writer had three major points of failure. No backup seed words, somehow also forgetting his pin, and letting his ~~daughter~~ *housecleaner* throw them away. 
edit: replace daughter with housecleaner.

@_date: 2017-10-29 13:19:09
When you first set up your hardware wallet you are presented with the “seed words” for your private key. These are a group of words that, if your wallet is damaged or lost, you can use to recover everything. Say for example you drop your trezor and it breaks in half - you can either order a new trezor or use wallet software on a PC, input the 16 words, and then you have all your coins again. Keeping your seed words safe is more important than keeping your hardware wallet safe - your hardware requires a pin to use, but with the seed anyone can use them for recovering coins. Of course you never want these stored digitally - you’ll want to hand write them and keep them in two locations if possible to avoid loss by fire, flood, etc.

Only problem is it takes days for your money to get to GDAX from a bank account. Lots of people aren't using GDAX not because they don't know how, but because they dont want to leave $500 on an exchange to buy with. Rather, when they get paid they wait for a dip and pull the trigger. If you aren't wealthy and trying to accumulate bitcoin its hard to just leave money in GDAX.

People were asking this at $100, $1,000, $2500, $3000, and very recently 4 and 5,000. Bitcoin is still very early and adoption is not nearly what it’s capable of. When you can walk into Walmart and use bitcoin to buy groceries you may be too late to make much money. But right now is still probably a great time if history is any indication.

1. Paper wallets *do not* protect against viruses and malware. That is why it is strongly recommended to set them up on machines that have never seen the internet or completely wiped and then have yet to go online. See here for a decent guide that explains why: 
2. Paper wallets are not pin protected and if someone found a paper wallet that can do whatever they want with the coins on it. If a trezor or ledger is found, without the pin you are SOL generally speaking, however see point 3. 
3. The exploit exists. It was demonstrated at defcon, and a quick google search will show you that while difficult, is *possible*. More information:
I’m not saying a paper wallet is bad. They are fantastic, however people need to understand the risks associated with them. If I was loading one up once and not touching it again I’d definitely go that route. If I’m going to be interacting with it I’ll use a hardware wallet as they protect against malware that can steal private key information. 
Edit: no idea why all points are being listed as 1.  - I’m on mobile that’s probably why.

It will always fluctuate, but you gotta zoom out past 1 and 5 min candles to see it's overall current trend. Think of it like a squiggly line in a downward direction. It will rise but fall more then rise then fall even lower. It usually rallies a bit after the weekend dump but by weds or thurs it's on it's way back down again. Obviously just past experience and not 100% guarantee, could be at 200k today of course (obviously not probable). 
I'm not aiming this at you but in general, a lot of people only pay attention to here and now. It was 1900 and now it's 2000 damn I should have bought. Instead of seeing two weeks ago it was 2700 and this week it went to 1700, damn I need a little more patient the trend is telling me there's a good chance itl drop to 1500 or lower. I think people lack either the understanding of trends or just are impulsive I'm not sure. Haha good luck and I hope to see you at the bottom where we get the cheapest deals of the year!

You are literally being given free money by this fork. Free money. Maybe its worth $250, maybe itll be worth $2. Its more about the principle though. They are holding YOUR coins, and when those coins get duplicated into BCC, they are keeping YOUR BCC. Regardless of if you think BCC is a joke or not - you can turn it into BTC and own ever more than before. I'm not saying they need to set it up like they have ETH and LTC setup where you can buy, sell, trade, etc. But at least give users the option to send their BCC to a wallet so they can do what they please with it. Its YOUR money after all. This is something central banks would do. Its robbery. 
If we had a magical fiat split and all of a sudden we had the same amount of Pesos as USD, and my bank said nah we don't support Pesos sorry, they should still give me my damn pesos even if i cant use it at their bank to finance a home. Its my money. Regardless of if you think the peso is a joke compared to USD. Its still yours. I dont know why people are so willing to let coinbase run off like this.

Aug1. No offense meant but if you own nearly $72k worth you really should be doing much more research than the person who owns $100 of bitcoin. The great thing about bitcoin is you get to truly be your own bank. The bad thing about bitcoin is you truly again manage your money - fuck up and theres no insurance or grace money. You should look into hardware wallets - you can get them between 60-300 deepening on when you want them - if you want one before aug 1 to secure your coins on both chains you're gonna have to pay closer to the 150-300 range - but, thats like .001% of your stack so it shouldn't be an issue. Again, no offense meant, just have seen over and over where exchanges have lost peoples money. I'd hate to have that kind of money (and that very could well be in the millions in a few years) floating on exchanges where you don't control the private key. Feel free to PM me if you are more interested in hardware wallets. Trezor and ledger are where id look.

This isnt just any shitcoin - it may be a shitcoin, but its a shitcoin with a decent amount of support and its been building up for months. Its not Joe Schmoe making his own random fork. This appears to be launching with some type of value. Even if you think its a shitcoin, you can convert it into real BTC and get some extra. I dont know why people dont want to do this. If you support BCC its free coins. If you hate BCC, its still free coins. 
edit: also, I dont think anyone expects them to set up buy/sell/trading for BCC - no one gives a crap about that. But a link on their website allowing you to do a one time send of BCC to whatever wallet you want would be the right thing to do. They don't need to fully support it like they do with ETH and LTC - but just give users an option to liquidate their new stack to do what they will with it.

Coinbase has flat out said they will not be giving you access to your BCC. They are the worst place to have coins right now. Move your coins to another exchange that supports BCC (I'm not sure which all do, their website will tell you, but I think most all will support minus coinbase) or send them temporarily to a wallet on your phone like breadwallet. Then you will have access to your BTC and BCC. If you believe in BCC you've got a bunch for free. If you think it's garbage just sell for fiat or convert it to the original BTC. Now you either have some free cash to spend or you have increased the amount of BTC you own and it didn't cost you a penny.

You can just do nothing, yes. But I would recommend moving your coins to somewhere that supports BCC. Even if you don't want it, you can convert it to BTC or fiat - it's free money man, in crypto or fiat. By keeping on coinbase you are basically throwing it down the toilet. Also, it might be worth keeping BCC just to have it. You might not believe in it, but it was free, and who knows - if the unthinkable happens and it's actually worth something you own it and you didn't pay a cent for it.

No one here is saying they are obligated to support BCC. I think most people think BCC is a slight joke - that being said, its an asset, no matter how you look at it due to its valuation. If I have one btc, soon Ill have one bitcoin and magically one BCC. Where do you think all those created BCC's are going that are being created by all of YOUR coins in coinbase's wallets? They are probably going to mass dump them to pay off some of the cash they lost during the etherium disaster last month. Please, if you love coinbase, keep your coins on them - but know you are basically taking your free money and telling coinbase to spend as they please. I'll never use coinbase again - was already burned by them with all the "maintenance" issues we saw earlier this summer during big dips in price - now they are running off with your BCC which you could convert into BTC to have even more than before. But nah, they gonna keep it. Glad I have a hardware wallet. Go to hell coinbase.

Do your own research and decide, but at the end of the day they are both fantastic. I personally own a trezor because you cant find ledgers anywhere under $300. Ledgers let you store more coins than trezor does though - I.E. you cant keep ripple on a trezor.

Maybe not *stealing* but perhaps kidnapping? Its your money. If you think BCC is a joke you can still convert that into extra BTC to make your stack bigger. I can't believe people are keeping coins on coinbase after reading all of this. If you support BCC, you get free BCC. If you think BCC is a joke/shitcoin/etc, well just convert them into BTC or USD and profit. Its a tiny amount of work for free coins. Mind = blown people dont care and are actually fighting to support coinbase in this.

I didn't buy eth because it's in a totally different situation. It's trapped in ICO hell thus aug 1 does not apply. I'll buy eth but I don't think now is the right time. Just my own personal logic not saying it's gospel. But op wanted a dip to buy and dip came. All I'm saying. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:23:25
It seems to be valued around $250 ATM, and just because you think it's stupid doesn't mean the majority of the masses will. I thought dogecoin was fucking stupid and it inflates forever, yet it holds *some* value. Look at Eth and Eth classic. Both still have value. If BCC is worth even $100 at launch and I convert to BTC I'll make a lot of money. But hey if you don't want free crypto to keep, convert, or sell, chill on coinbase. You probably don't have much if you keep coins on coinbase anyway. But hey man I'm not gonna try and convince you to take free money. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:00:15
It is still *technically* possible for a hardfork, which means the new coin could technically replace the old one as a value store. I'm not here to discuss politics, and regardless of what I believe or you believe, if you have any significant value of btc, you could essentially own nothing in a worst case scenario if you keep the on coinbase.

I agree with the article, coinbase needs to get their shit together or get out. No one wants to invest if their funds are locked up for hours during crucial dips and highs.

scumbag coinbase strikes again. Every time I think they have turned a new leaf and give a fuck about customers or investing in customer service with the millions they have made from their high as fuck fees I see a post like this and hope that company loses all their customers. As soon as I get confirmed at kraken and gemini im done with their thievery. We are into crypto to avoid banking monsters and coinbase is becoming just that. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:59:57
I'd definitely recommend a Trezor - even without much btc right now, if you plan on hodling, you can't beat a hardware wallet. I bought one as they are getting more difficult to get as demand goes up and I plan on dollar cost averaging purchases continually from here on out. I figured I'd rather take the short term hit of the purchase than put it off and lose my btc down the road.

This is a stupid question but how can someone send coins to a device without connecting it to a pc? Doesn't your trezor need the private key sent to it for ownership? I may be misunderstanding how trezor works though. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:26:21
I've only gotten into btc recently but one of the first things I did was buy a trezor and send all my coins to it. It's a little pricey upfront but I think everyone should invest in some form of a hardware wallet / paper wallet. Leaving my coins on coinbase scared the shit out of me after reading a few stories like these. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:48:48
is yours one of the metal ones?
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:23:57
Just out of curiosity as someone just getting into crypto, are you storing paper wallet(s) in your safe, or are you using a hardware wallet and leaving it and/or the seed in there?

I'd buy a trezor or ledger if at all possible. Bread is way better than leaving on coinbase but if you're going to start investing more than a hundred or two a hardware wallet is what you want.

He probably means with bitcoin he could see 5K go to $50, whereas if he cashes in his 5K now he can still pay rent for the next couple months. His rent or food *probably* won't double or triple in price due to dollar fluctuations in 3 months, whereas in this stage of bitcoin he could easily have enough to live on for a month today and tomorrow have enough for half a burrito.

I guess my question is how does the key get to the trezor of it's in a safety deposit box? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:44:29
Any exchange can be hacked or one day go offline and never come back. Any coins you have on their website you don't own the keys for so when they go your coins go. Lots of people had stuff on mt gox (an older coinbase) and lost tons when it went under. Like I said if your day trading aka buying and selling each day then you gotta keep it on an exchange. But if you saving some don't keep everything on coinbase you could lose it all. Also, coinbase specifically goes down every time there is a huge dip and your coins are inaccessible. So if you want to buy or sell or do anything with your coins during the action you're SOL. Check out if you really want to see how bad it is. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:11:14
Thanks - one last question - when I got into btc I was told to buy on coinbase and store on blockchain - since blockchain offers no way to buy/sell at the moment, and its still an online storage solution, are there any benefits at all to spending the money transferring to a blockchain wallet? This makes no sense to me but I may be misunderstanding something. Thanks again,

I'm new to bitcoin, but could someone explain if a mobile wallet on my iPhone would be better than keeping them on blockchain, and how it differs from a desktop wallet? In the guide it mentions you need to control your own keys - would using a "mobile" cell phone wallet give me my keys? I am still a little confused on the difference between cellphone and desktop wallets work.

Hes being sarcastic. Keeping coins in an exchange is the absolute last thing you want to do. Get them out of exchanges if at all possible. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:57:28
I guess what I don't understand is I live in the US but can use my bank card for casino gambling and online gambling with no issue. Just seems odd but I guess on a global level they have to protect themselves.

As a newer user, how do you store your coins? I have a hardware wallet but I'd be terrified of keeping 1mil of coins in a single device the size of a flash drive. I'd also be terrified of keeping them on an exchange, or anywhere for that matter. I hope to be in your shoes one day, can you explain how people like you store? Thanks!

Can get it direct from their website if you want to pay in bitcoin, it's 99 usd and then 9 or 19 for shipping depending on carrier. You can also get one from them on Amazon, however you pay a premium of 139.99. Shipping is free but it's still a bit more expensive. I got mine on Amazon and I got it the next day.

I am a noob who just got into crypto less than a month ago. I learned HODL the days before I made any purchases by looking at the past trends. Bought in expecting the huge dips and gains. Just another day. Now if it would crash to 1k so I could stock up. ��
