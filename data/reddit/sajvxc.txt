With a little help by your friends in Panama or Nevada you can already hide your wealth or income from the govt. Guess what - a lot of people are just willing to pay taxes.

If you are a true bitcoin believer you don't care about the price to USD! If you do you are just a speculator who wants to cash out on the next bubble! True bitcoin believers just buy bitcoins because they believe that in 10 or 20 years all transactions will be made in BTC - and then the relative price of USD becomes irrelevant.

The euro was never about to collapse - and nobody concerned about his savings would have considered investing in a new cryptocurrency as a reasonable alternative. you might get this impression inside the bitcoin bubble but in reality this phenomenon is restricted to people trying to convert their assets into another fiat currency (via bitcoin), see for [example](

that's so ironic, since most of the users are waiting for a surge in  the price to finally dump their btc. this is one of the most hypocritical reddits I know.

I wish this sub was less about bitcoin speculation and rather about interest in the technology. all you people sound like you can't wait for the next price bubble to cash out. I think the price isn't gonna go anywhere, but the technology is. and this doesn't have to be coupled at all. The price only needs to reflect a reward for performing certain tasks (ie. colored coins for attributing ownership of a company). it doesn't need to represent any *other* fundamental value - ie. like gold.

I have to slightly disagree with you there. The two issues are not unsolvable (in my interpretation of the article). BitcoinXT would have addressed the protocol issue (ie. the growing backlog of transactions). However it was impossible to get the xt network running because it kept getting DDoSd. I assume we'll have a working bitcoin protocol once the Chinese miners have gone out of business or for some other reason stopped DDoSing a new fork.

It really is a complete joke. No wonder Mike Hearn lost hope with this community. As he pointed out very clearly: Bitcoin doesn't have a technical problem, it has a political problem. It's run by circle jerking conspiracy theorists who have already forgotten about the gist of his blog post.

please let's keep the retarded gold bugs out of this sub. gold didn't have a constant purchasing power over the last 100 years.

Are you sure? This graph tells another story:

Take my advice and cash out early on this one. This does not look like solid growth, but rather like speculation ignited by the MMM Global ponzi scheme. See:
