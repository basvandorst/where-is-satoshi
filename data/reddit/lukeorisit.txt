So even though there are a fixed number of bitcoins, there are theoretically an unlimited amount of cryptocoins.  If it's this easy to change the source, it's also this easy for merchants to accept it and for copycat infrastructure to be built around it.  Sounds like inflation to me...... But at least its market driven and not government driven?.....

Waiting a week or more for coinbase is common.  Don't stress too much.

copypasta from an earlier post:
"I wouldn't recommend mt gox, since it takes months to get your US dollars out of it. BTCChina is also hard for non-Chinese citizens, though I'm not sure how hard. BTCe and Bitstamp require different authentication than coinbase. You need a proof of residence and an ID I believe. All four are exchanges, which means you load your USD onto the exchange first, and then daytrade to your hearts content with it. Coinbase is a broker, not a true exchange. There is also Vault of Satoshi, CaVirtex, Kraken, and Bitfinex. Though Bitfinex is used mostly for margin trading. Hope that helps. I just use coinbase though. Buy and hold!"

The April crash was so steep because there was only one exchange and it was DDoS'd.  The next crash/correction won't be as dramatic as April because there are now 4 significant exchanges.

Buy on coinbase if you're in the US.  Or another exchange.  You don't need the client to buy.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:04:58
yes.  your first purchase is always a debit purchase.  Once you have successfully completed a debit purchase and waited 30 days, then you can use your credit card to  instantly purchase coins.  With a credit card, coinbase is assured that you are assuming the risk.

I did this too!  I'm glad I did research the third time.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:48:22
If you move your money onto an exchange like bitstamp or btce, which can take as long as a coinbase buy, then I think you can buy/sell instantly.  If you want to cash out from the exchange back to your bank, that takes some time too.
Alternatively, you could use localbitcoins and meet up with someone in person.
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:05:12
its a give and take between the consumers and the merchants.  At least now there is more of a reason to develop infrastructure around it.

Coinbase is a broker who uses bitstamp as their primary exchange.  there price is roughly 3% greater than stamps.
If you're just investing, coinbase is the way to go.  If you want to day-trade, you should use one of the four main exchanges.  That being said, gox sucks, and your not a chinese national, so the only big exchanges left are bitstamp and btce.  Campbx in Canada is 5th, you could look into them.  There are a lot of small exchanges with not enough volume too.  Kraken somewhere in Europe and Coinsetter in NYC come to mind.
If you haven't signed up already...
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:20:02
I think you're right.  I'm only a level 1 user and was just passing on what I'd heard.  Can Coinbase do instant purchases?  Level 2? under 1btc? both? either?  I'm getting tired of waiting a week before I can sell.

Well if you're buying in USD that are already on the exchange, no, you get your bitcoin as fast as the exchange's software can process it.  If you use coinbase, they use ACH transfers which take 3 days each direction.
blockchain transaction verification is for bitcoin to bitcoin transactions.

A little long, but well put.  I think most people are assuming the gold to silver ratio for BTC/LTC.  Historically this was 16/1, which would place LTC at 6.25% of BTC.  
BTCe has 0.04519 BTC/LTC at the time of posting, so maybe we shouldn't be too worried.  
I wonder if the gold/silver ratio fluctuated wildly, or if it hovered around 16/1 for most of history.  If so, why.

Invest in some real estate.  Get an apartment/condo or small house.  If you want to move you can always rent it to someone, and pay your rent with their rent.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:31:18
Exactly.  How hard could it be to just copycat the infrastructure?  Bitpay could remove merchants from all risk of holding any crypto.  If no one cares about the underlying currency, just the fiat currency value, and one can always make new altcoins, then altcoins effectively inflate the crypto-currency market.  Its just like the fed printing US dollars except its market driven, not fed driven.  
If the inflation is market driven maybe its okay?  Still, I liked my deflationary spiral....
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:39:18
This is the major complaint, but volatility will level out in time.  Most owners of BTC will try and buy an equivalent amount of bitcoin when they make their bitcoin purchase.  Most merchants currently switch back to USD to avoid the volatility.  Early game, it is more of an investment opportunity and less of a currency.  But if we can cross the chasm from early adopters to early majority, then we'll ride the S-curve up, level out, and then bitcoin's usefulness as a currency will truly shine!

You could register an account with coinbase.  It would take a while to register and confirm everything, but its easy.  Also you should hold onto that sucker b/c if you haven't heard, we're going TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:36:19
If you're in the US, coinbase.
localbitcoins is also fairly easy.

Multi-part question here.
What are your thoughts on the smarter transaction fees problem Gavin is working on?  
If this isn't solved in time do you think it could cripple the BTC economy?  
To what degree?  
How easy do you think the problem is to solve?
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:38:41
maybe try localbitcoins.  I'm not sure how many Philippines sellers there are on localbitcoins though.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:46:31
I'm right there with you buddy.  Sold 65% of my holdings at 650 on coinbase.  Even if it goes under 650 again, it would need to stay there for a day or two before I have the money to buy back in.

Gavin Andresen is the lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation.  I think he is in charge of updating the protocol.  I don't think that they can change the 21 million coin cap, but I may be wrong.  Right now, they're working on smarter transaction fees.

@_date: 2013-11-28 21:09:31
If I give someone bitcoins as a gift, i.e. there are no services rendered, do they inherit my basis?
In the Shawshank Redemption, a guard avoids paying taxes by making a onetime gift to his spouse.  Is this a real law? or just a movie gimmick?

As far as I know, the exchanges use their own system.  Its practically an excel spreadsheet assigning values of each currency (USD, BTC, LTC) to each username.  They just move the numbers around.  When they transfer your coins to an external address, then they use the BTC protocol.
As to your last question, you are always trusting the exchange with your money.  Its only yours once you send it from the exchange to an address that you control.  That being said, I trust these exchanges, and leave some BTC in their system for convenience.

Coinbase is roughly 3% higher than bitstamp, but they take into account the other three main exchanges and probably some internal supply/demand stuff.

Hey man.  I'm sorry that some people are finding fault with your book, but congratulations on composing something and putting it out there.  Most people can only get good at a few things, and its hard to understand Bitcoin as well as some of these tech people and also have the skills to get a book published and in the market place.  In future editions, with their help, I'm sure your book will be lovely, but you'll be the one keeping the paycheck.  Props on publishing.  I'd like to someday.

Yeah.  I just use coinbase because its the easiest.  But people use the exchanges.  If you want to day-trade it might be worth it.  That being said, day-trading is hard.  Just buy and hold!
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:03:08
exactly!  We should really compare BTC to a basket of the top global currencies.  I guess that's what market capitalization does though....
