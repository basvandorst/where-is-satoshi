Sunk cost fallacy

Doubling down because the price went down and you lost money is sunk cost fallacy. When it drops again should they double down again to reduce their average price? Sunk cost fallacy. 
They are not mutually exclusive. He presented the mathematical term I presented the psychological term for the same thing. They are very much related.

I'm pretty sure I do. I don't think you're as smart as you think you are.

You might not be.


The difference is in whether you would have invested another 1k if the price had stayed the same. No? Sunk cost. Yes? Continue.

I did above, buying on a uptrend. If your next purchase is more expensive than your initial you did worse than splitting. I don't know why you think you've found some ultimate strategy, it's maths.
Edit: I see you think I mean average costs, I didn't. I was talking about the cost of buying with all now or split. Because that is the opposite of dollar cost averaging and the average of costs is of no relevance. It is explained what I mean further in my post and it is absolutely correct. Poor wording on my behalf in that first sentence I'll give you that, it doesn't make much sense. Its a good job we're not pedants right?

You thought wrong,

It requires the cost of goods and services as a whole to increase to reduce the value of it, if the value of USD falls in comparison to GBP that is not inflation.
Inflation works like this:  
* All the goods and services you buy increase in value. 
* Pay increases. 
Giving people the same (or similar) buying power with new money but decreasing that of old money. 
Incentivising usage of money so that it doesn't end up like Bitcoin where everyone just holds on to it.

Christ dude. I am an advocate for cost averaging. I am not suggesting doing another strategy. I am explaining what it actually does and the fact you don't know is precisely my point which is why it lowers potential profit in exchange for lowering potential risk.
Go and look at my post history and see whether I advocate risk reduction, I am explaining the actual effect cost averaging has which is to shift your position more towards the center of whatever trend you bought into this reducing the extremities of all outcomes (both profit and loss).

Except in the case of crypto where many of us bought in with a fraction of our current worth, throwing good money that we have now in amounts that will have any effect on our overall takings now would be extremely unwise.

Except a lot of the time the price average cost is higher than the costs.
That isn't what dollar cost averaging actually does, as in you gave a specific scenario. What dollar cost averaging actually does is:
**It lowers potential profit in return for lowering potential loss.**
If you average on a rising trend you reduce your profit, if you average on a lowering trend you reduced your loss. That is all. You will either make a loss or a profit or come out equal. Dollar cost averaging makes your profit or loss less extreme.

USDT is only worth $1 because for every single USDT printed there is guaranteed to be the equivalent  $1 held by Tether.
If an audit says they do not have the funds backing it, it will not only not be worth $1 but it will likely be worth nothing as people race to exit now that the tokens entire reason for existence is no more.
The only point of Tether is to allow you to trade against the dollar outside of regulation and it requires Tether to hold the equivalent cash under the guarantee that you can always exchange your tether back for its cash value. That is what keeps it so stable. It will never do anything but that.
Think of Tether like arcade tokens (Disney money, whatever you like), arcade tokens are worth whatever the value of the items you can redeem them are worth. If you cannot redeem them then those tokens are now worthless.
