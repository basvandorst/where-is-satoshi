So he thinks people are going to use a currency "bitnote" which can be printed like todays money, over bitcoin.
That's interesting.
Either that or he thinks there are only 21M tradeable units.

Overstock is going to offer a discount soon I've heard somewhere. Can't remember where, might be an interview or something.
Businesses first accept bitcoin, after a month/quarter they look at the numbers and realize they have a higher return if people pay with bitcoin, after which they will incentivize costumers to pay with bitcoin.
It just takes time.

I agree.
I actually bought my first bitcoins after the news of the first BTC ATM in vancouver hit.
An ATM makes it "real" and easy to get.

All EURO notes have buildings on it. Most coins don't have faces either.

It is actually done at an annoyingly slow place. If you wait a couple of days someone will add it onto the blockchain.

It's easy to get a bit paranoid when it comes to storing bitcoin. Nobody really knows how secure or insecure their computer is and nobody wants to lose their coins either.
2-factor authentication works so that you only have to enter your authentication once on each device, unless you state otherwise. So it's not really that much of a hassle. Whether you store any bitcoin files on it or not, it's very wise to enable this on your gmail account anyway. You can have an extremely secure password on certain sites, but if your gmail account isn't safe, hackers can always get access to your account that way.
Personally I keep 80% of my bitcoin on paper, which I made with an ubuntu live-cd, one copy at home, one copy with a familymember. The rest I keep on my PC with a backup on my secondary gmail account, which has 2-factor authentication on it (just like my first one, but you can't access the 2nd one on my phone) and a bit on my phone for easy spending.

No, because there's no new block found for 35 minutes now. It's bitcoin, not the client. No worries.

He's right on a lot of stuff.
It's unregulated, it's not stable aka it goes up and down, it's not simple, it's like trading other currencies (big surprise there), mt gox disappeared, coins are missing, on the short term you could easily lose half your worth so it's kinda financially dangerous and he loves his relatives.

When all the coins are mined, hopefully bitcoin will be big enough so the transaction fees give enough of an incentive for people to mine.
Bitcoin self-adjusts every X amount of blocks. The difficulty is set so it always takes on average 10 minutes. If there's less mining, it'll get easier, if there's more mining it'll get harder.

USB flash drives and basically any electronic storage have a certain risk of failure. Although the risk is fairly low, you don't want to be that one guy who's drive got corrupted.
Paper wallets are fairly easy to make offline from a bootable disk. Which is the only 100% secure way of making keys.
Storing the file in a 2-factor authenticated storage service, like drop-box or gmail is also an easy and pretty secure way.
It depends largely on how much you'll end up having, and how high of a risk you want to take with it.

The confirmation is depending on blocks found. The transaction happens instantly.
edit: it should be fine now, check your transaction
actually, it wasn't 35 minutes, my browser didn't reload :s

That's how armory does it. 
Electrum has also a paper wallet option. I never worked with that personally.
The traditional way, which is imo the safest, is to download a paper wallet generator like at  ,  , 
run it off a live linux CD offline, generate the keys and print them, after which you can transfer to the paper wallet. That way your private key has never had the chance to get online. You can encrypt your paper wallet with a passphrase (BIP38) when you generate it.
safepaperwallet.com has an iso image which is made specially for this. It has no network capability and automatically starts the wallet generator when you start up.
The wallet doesn't look as pretty as some of the other ones though.
There are a lot of guides online that explain this process in detail.
If you think this is too much or don't want to go through all this hassle,  backing up your armory wallet on paper is just fine.

People would buy in bitcoin if the price is down, and buy in fiat of the price is up.
Even if you only accept BTC, most profit margins are so low you'll often make a loss when the price goes up.
People will only do this when the BTC price gets stable, and we're a long way from that.
