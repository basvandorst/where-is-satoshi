Thanks! I'm a software developer and this is my favorite side project, I get more satisfaction out of building and updating it them actually trading (although finding and capitalizing on a great trade is an awesome feeling! ) :D

I've been using the site for months, full of really shitty coins and pump and dump groups, but there's no trade api so you don't have to compete with bots. Great for making money trading on, although with the surge of new users the site has turned very laggy and goes down frequently as they upgrade. Security also seems a bit lax, so I wouldn't leave a lot of coins on the site. Currently main url is down and their twitter is suggesting an alternative (coinexchange2.com)... use with caution though, am not convinced their twitter isn't hacked.
Overall its my preferred site to use for trading. I like the UI over other sites, and the lack of trade bots means I can capitalize on arbitrage opportunities that come up. I don't have a lot of btc, but can usually make .01 regularly on days I'm active. Funded my christmas presents this year :)

LTC/DOGE and DOGE/LTC come up fairly frequently as the price of DOGE and LTC shifts. If DOGE is shifting a lot in price, watch doge markets; if ETH, watch eth markets, etc.
But arb opportunities go fast. You can connect to their public api to query data and run the calculations yourself... that's what I do to find arb opportunities. The api can be a tad behind though, especially if the site is busy, so often someone else watching the coin gets it first.
Here's the [best one I've seen yet]( Screenshot it because it was go good! 0.58 BTC up for grabs, down to 0.31 a minute later, and completely gone the minute after that. Think to trade the full order you needed about 17BTC.... I only got about 0.05 of it because I don't have that kind of BTC sitting around and had to move it in slower amounts :)

Its just something custom I built using their api. I thought about [trying to sell it]( but ultimately it's more profitable for me to keep it and be the only user. Easy enough for people to build their own though :)

Thanks, didn't realize I could order directly from website :)

You only gain/lose when you sell it! I know people who bought in at 9 back in 2017. If they sold when it dropped it would be a loss, but if they could afford to just let it sit they can choose to sell when it's higher. Don't invest anything you can't live without

Thanks! I started trying to clean it up for marketing to others this week, and am currently working on some documentation for it in Google Docs. You can check that out now if you want : 
Its a hobby project I started last month in my free time, and have been sharing the updated .exe with my brothers via google drive. I probably should plan to do a website for it and distribute it properly, but my rough idea for now was to maybe just have people send me .001 BTC or something (around $4.50?) and email me the transaction Id so I can add their email to the list of allowed emails to access the google drive account... I'm new to all of this, learning as I go :)

Haha I know reddit has an active community for almost everything, but I know it's not the only one.... plus, I don't like to sell things on reddit. Someone mentioned something like bit garden to me once, but I can't find it.
