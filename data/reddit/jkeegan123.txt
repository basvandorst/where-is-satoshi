Why didn't you just ach xfer in and use a credit card to buy gifts while you wait for the xfer to hit? You know that they don't charge interest on purchases if you pay in full on the same month?

Can you wire a large amount directly from the exchange to the bank to payoff? The asset may never hit your books then...

If Amazon starts accepting bitcoin, things will change. Are there any rumors on if /when this will happen?
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:20:34
As mentioned by the previous poster, do you think that is already baked into today's $11.5k price?  Or is it yet to go higher?  A banker friend told me that they received 10+ orders to wire money to Coinbase.com today as a customer service rep ... Volume going UP!  Price SHOULD continue ...

Will this stabilize Bitcoin ?  Or will it drive it UP and there is a feeding frenzy to OBTAIN Bitcoin?

I believe if you have a cash balance at coinbase that they insure it. Bitcoins are not guaranteed but I believe they operate with mostly cold storage coins anyway...
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:56:19
...in an unregulated market.  
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:13:49
The reason that people suggest that hardware wallets are safer is because with coinbase (or any exchange), you don't really have whatever asset you think you have... The EXCHANGE has that asset (you hope). What you have is an account with that exchange that SAYS you have that asset, and when you send or receive bitcoin, they're really receiving it and crediting your account. Not unlike a bank, if you don't have cash but you have a balance, you're trusting that the bank will do what you command them to do with your balance when you command them to do it. There's a lot of trust in both... You're trusting Coinbase to send and receive {digital asset} on your behalf when you command them to, just like you trust a bank to do the same (think online banking or wiring money).
The biggest difference is that the bank is answerable to the government and the federal reserve with regard to regulation, and your balance is insured usually up to $250k...bitcoin exchanges are not... This is a big complaint when you hear "unregulated market". 
If your bitcoin exchange went bankrupt, your balance usually is forfeit.
If you had a hardware wallet, though, you can never lose your bitcoin unless you spend it, or it gets hacked. It's actually ON CHAIN, not on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:04:40

People were wary of banks after the crash of 1929 and got over that.  Now cash is not used for large transactions, BANKS are.  The paradigm shifted.
This is the Paradigm shift in motion.
People are wary of Bitcoins but eventually ... as it becomes more and more mainstream and less of a mystery, people will trust it, use it, and the Paradigm will shift again.  
The current Bitcoin utilization right now is SO LOW because it's new.  When it picks up more momentum, which speculative interest is doing, it's going to go UP UP UP even more, probably to 40 - 50k per bitcoin (because after all there's only 21 million BTC that will ever be in existence...).  When utilization hits something as mainstream as Credit Cards, the value of a single whole BTC will be extremely rare and TREMENDOUS.  We're going to be dealing with SATOSHI's, not whole BTC's.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:35:36
I wonder how many cowards panic-sold ?  They'll be telling the story about how BITCOIN caused them to lose their entire life savings (10k) in a single week of volatility.

I would say ... accounts at multiple Exchanges, linked to multiple bank accounts, just in case your fiat bank decides to close your account because of BITCOIN trading.
Local Bitcoin does not seem expedient ...

Half of what?  It's not officially ANYTHING ... it's a giftcard economy.  Maybe once it's called an official currency she might be able to take half.  At this point today it's the same as saying, "I have a lot invested into Word of Warcraft, so we should split the account's assets."

@_date: 2017-11-16 22:00:08
How big does everyone think that the 8000 sell wall is? Once it hits 8k I think it will go to 7500 or so from massive sell off. It will recover but I think that's the way it will go considering other milestones... Anyone?

That's what I'm saying .... people want millions or billions .... 400k for me would be the perfect balance of WANT vs. HAVE without being gaudy.  I don't need beyonce's infinity pool ... 400k a year wouldn't get it for me.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:32:10
100k seems fairly improbable, even though I hope like hell...all rules of supply and demand seem to say that this is not only probable but LIKELY given a global market and the natural scarcity of BTC ... but at 100k is BTC usable?  What is the lowest denomination, a SATOSHI, right?  0.00000001 iirc.  Today that's .... a lot less than 1 cent ... at 100k that would be ... I think 0.001, or 1/1000th of a cent.  So ... maybe I just convinced myself.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:46:59
While I agree the future is going to involved Bitcoin, I doubt that there will ever not be a $USD.  What I'm saying is ... if it hits a certain point, isn't it worth liquidating some?  I mean .... a $20k BTC will make everyone think ... MAYBE HODLING is for SUCKAS ... especially if you're holding 100 BTC.  If you're really a HODL'er, you probably have your BTC in at $200 - $300.  
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:35:10
I don't think it's going to tank, mind you ... but what if it did? Is that possibility alone worth cashing a chunk out?  That's what I'm thinking ... not doing, but thinking.  
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:05:31
Reasonable in that I think that at 400k I could do everything I wanted within reason, have everything I wanted within reason, and not want for really anything.  
In reality, of course, I'm with you ... real life budget  are 50k - 120k depending on  your lifestyle.

@_date: 2017-09-02 02:40:52
This is not a simple answer.  
- It's global.  Not just in the US.  BTC is everywhere and EVERYONE wants it, not just the US.
- 21 million.  EVER.  That makes it EXTREMELY RARE when you consider that it's GLOBAL.  
- Once the rules of supply and demand hit this rare commodity correctly, since it's RARE, the value will be ASTRONOMICALLY higher than it is now.  
- BTC only has 2 - 3 percentage adoption, IF THAT.  The use case is EXTREMELY SMALL right now.  Push this to even 10 percent and you're talking ... that's no moon, it's a SPACE STATION.

The next big story will be...usgov taxes bitcoin. And that won't stop it either. 
And even if the banks create their own blockchain vehicle, the reason why bitcoin will never be able to be replaced is... Nobody can control bitcoin. Any bank vehicle will be able to be controlled 100 percent by the bank.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:34:20
That's a very reasonable response.  So ... what's your "SET FOR LIFE" number?  At 7 million invested conservatively, you can live on about $400k per year in dividends without touching your principal.  Is 400k per year good for your "SET FOR LIFE"?  That's a reasonable life style, 2 - 3 vacations per year, modest upper-middle class living in a nice suburban area, not buying boats, lambos, and cars for cash.  
What do you think?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:04:22
In a perfect world ... but once that perfect world happen, won't prices normalize and BTC will be worth an equivalent equal amount of dollars?  Only early adopters would have BUKU BTC at that point, the rest will just have ... currency = to their salary, wage, etc...
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:50:17
I want to believe this but ... are the banks going to just ROLL OVER and give up control?  I mean, seriously ... think about what the banks allow to happen in modern society today (for good or bad):
- You can reverse a transaction if a fraudulent transaction happens on your account.
- You can reverse a transaction for a refund.
- You can reverse or cancel a transaction if you do not get what you were supposed to get.
- Authorities can freeze your account if you are delinquent on other legal obligations
All of this cannot happen with BITCOIN, which is largely the UPSIDE of Bitcoin ... but with the REFUNDS and reversals not able to happen anymore, people could have some bad things go down just by not being responsible.  The ANSWER could be ... BANKS could become BITCOIN ESCROW SERVICES, and therefore remain relevant.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:35:33

I think the words you're looking for are "victimless crime".  It's something that hurts no one, since it would not have been bought if it had not been torrented, so the net loss is ZERO.  Also, it's software, something that is able to be duplicated AT WILL.  So there's not even a production cost lost.  It is truly a victimless crime.

It's funny, I read the DAEMON series by Daniel Suarez I believe, and this 3 book series depicts an Internet revolution based on goggles like Google glass that transform everyone using them into "avatars" in a new world economy based on credits rather than money, with each avatars net worth and "rank" following them like a level label... Great series, but the way that money stopped being worth anything because of the ultimate loss of confidence in the government that issues the fiat currency ushered in the new worth of the Internet credit... I think that op is correct in bitcoins ability to be a disruptive force, but we are missing a catalyst to strike this down... Bitcoins rise needs to happen just as something huge like a bank run happens, only then cam we see this amazing thing rise to full potential... Not because it can't, but because people are too comfortable to change without something to lose.
