They would not be able to borrow so much in the first place.

It must be legit.

This is a joint-stock company (in Polish, S.A. - Spółka Akcyjna) - you can do whatever you wish with your shares. There are no limitations like these and this comes from the Polish law.
You can sell those shares to anyone, as long as they are willing to buy them from you. And here is the hardship in this.

One thing worth mentioning is that  is actually using InPay's software to process payments in Bitcoin. How cool is that? :&gt;
@_date: 2018-05-10 07:36:08
It's actually really good. Try it with cranberries. It's even more awesome.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:00:28
You mean like this sub, but in reverse? ];)
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:12:34
I REALLY don't want to ;)
@_date: 2014-10-19 13:00:36
No, you can pay right now in Bitcoin for REAL shares (you will get paper copy, validated by a notary).
@_date: 2014-10-21 12:04:14
Well, the only diffrence is that they are legally obliged to recognize your shares. No big deal.
@_date: 2014-10-21 10:22:23
There is a Bitcoin accepted here sign on the project page (added after your comment :)). And the notary part comes from my insider knowledge - we do miss that information on the project page, but those shares are registered and legally binding in Poland. It's the first time you can do that, actually.
@_date: 2014-10-21 11:14:31
There is PayPal support now :)
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:58:50
This was clearly a joke... Seriously?
@_date: 2014-10-19 13:01:47
It's a real company registered in Poland (and England for tax purposes) that actually has a good history in Polish Bitcoin community.

Beesfund.com dev here
It's not really that risky - all of our payments go directly to InPay and we cooperate very closely on this project (we are both located in Warsaw, Poland). So if you trust them, you should have no problem with us. We just collect the data to be able to send physical, printed version of shares on the addresses provided by everyone and run the platform itself.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:53:14
I think it's just marketing and has nothing to do with real savings.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:52:32
And Poland is neither ;)

Privacy - Google knows which websites your visitors visit. 
Risk of downtime - if your site is down it doesn't matter you don't have fonts or js/css files. If CDN is down and your site is up then you have a problem.
Risk of hack - somebody could insert evil thing into hosted jQuery file. Magically, half of the Internet is infected.
And some others. Quite frankly I believe that remote CDN that doesn't belong to you is quite a big risk.
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:05:04
As a webdeveloper, good to know another argument not to use those hosted fonts/scripts. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-08 01:26:08
Why would anybody do that? I'm tired of people pasting their adresses like that.
@_date: 2013-09-20 14:03:43
I saw your post on wykop.pl some time ago. Wouldn't expect that you implement Bitcoin ^^. Nice move.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:06:26
What functionalities do you need?
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:20:23
Yeah, thought the same thing. It's like somebody put a ruler in there :P

Send me 100 XBT. I will send you 1000 tomorrow ;)

Unfortunately I'm not an accountant nor participated in any economy classes. Would need some more details - maybe if you could send me empty spreadsheet you use I would be able to figure it out. 
I know of some system that can be easily configured to very specific requirements, a little similar to Excel, but focused on workflow. We are developing it in a company i work for and could give a small demo. I'm just curious if it would fit your needs.
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:33:42
Exactly my thoughts!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:42:20
Smart people will buy in a month or even more, when the price drops to at least 10$.
@_date: 2013-09-30 20:47:36
How are you going to compete with tradingview? They seem to be having time advantage and provide really big set of indicators.
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:01:19
Except for the fact that you can actually use it.

People will warn you from USD volatility. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 22:04:41
No, they don't. Not yet at least.
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:05:49
I wonder a lot how much other exchanges followed Gox price for so long that they started believing the trend is "up" instead of "down".
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:53:27
Not gonna happen. 100$ is the new roof.
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:09:59
Looks really nice. One doubt - why flash? It's dying and not available on all mobile devices.
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:33:04
Actually, it could be much slower without porn. People watching it needed bigger network, so ISPs provided it. Without that we could still use 128k ;)

What he means is that this survey system inserts whatever you typed in the form before. It's not PayPal doing any kind of concious choice about those questions.
In other words: If I wrote "Cow shit" there, It would ask about "Cow shit" on the next page.
@_date: 2013-06-10 11:51:20
This actually is a very possible scenario...
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:35:45
Yeah, pros are busy punping stocks ;)
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:08:05
How about this:
Set time range 1980 - 2013. Especially look what happend in 2008.  All this money is currently suck in stocks. When those crash and people cash out prices will start to rise. At least that's what I believe. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:48:52
Once again?
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:53:21
Was. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 20:14:17
Wow man, you just got carried away :D So much text... Good job though. We need that. And more of that.
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:44:46
Not necessarily. If Bitcoins ecosystem grows and there is a lot more services and products available, then the price could stay on those high levels and all that came in early would get their reward, whereas those who came late would just have stable currency.
Of course I'm not saying it's happening now. Not even in next 2-3 years probably, but it doesn't have to end at 0 ;)
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:14:17
Same here ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:26:37
Actually, I don't have any real experience as a trader nor have I any bitcoins. I have been waiting for this drop for two weeks now. It was really obvious that bitcoin isn't worth this much. Prices above 200USD are just insane! I was surprised when they were at 250$ level. And I'm not the only one - maybe that's the reason why people who bought early started selling.
Look at this chart:  This is history of bitcoin prices through entire bitcoin history. For more than a year the price was steadily growing. What we have right now i an anomally that sooner or later will end like previous one - with major drop even below its normal price.
This is all my opinion and I'm waiting until the price drops really low - probably around 10-20$. Only then i can be more or less sure that the price will go up. If I'm wrong and it won't drop to that level - well, I won't lose anything, will I?
Sorry for my english, I'm not a native speaker ;) Cheers from Poland.

WTF. When I read about American banking system I'm thinking about third world. I mean literally, third world. Poland starts to look like a heaven -.-'
Bank accounts are free, with free Internet and mobile access. 2 factor authentication via sms enabled by default for all Internet transactions... 
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:46:16
I actually believe (and are one of the most influential places of the Bitcoin trading universe. Add bitcointalk to that and we probably have most of the places where whales would actually look.
@_date: 2013-07-28 20:16:52
You would get filtered by spam protectors after 10.000 or some other magic number known only to them ;)
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:22:27


No, you cannot. I bet over 90% of your money is in the bank. And it won't work without power or network connection.
This article is shit. I really regret reading it.
@_date: 2013-09-03 21:32:35
Actually, biggest danger is that the computers will overperform human brain eventually in such tasks. And that's pretty plausible if you ask me. 
For now, such coin could make sense, but not long term. And if it doesn't make sense long term, it doesn't make sense short term either.
@_date: 2013-09-29 18:34:17
I think your reasoning is wrong. The very first thing that somebody who would like to steal BTC from brainwallets would do is creating a database of his known phrases and not trying to break into someones wallet. More like:
1. Get last block and all transactions from it.
2. For every incoming transaction, get an address and then check if it exists in your database.
3. Snatch the coins if it does.
4. Generate even more phrases in the meantime on another computer.
This means that your phrases didn't get automatically hacked because they weren't that typical. But if anyone would put ANY effort to break them, they would still probably go down pretty fast and defenitely in less than a week.
@_date: 2013-10-11 10:33:02
Somebody pays for those computers and created those IT systems... So no, it's not "free". Shouldn't have been THAT expensive though.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:19:06
You can use Google 2FA at MtGox without any problems... The real problem is that they don't force you to do so.
@_date: 2013-05-05 11:26:32
Yes you were. Sorry for giving comments not backed by actual knowledge. I'm waiting until it drops low enough so I could invest with smaller risk. Right now it's a real roller coaster as we can see ;)
I wonder how much this is caused be the Chineese information.
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:44:21
This is a good theory actually... Probably just people scared of the prices going further down are downvoting you ;)
@_date: 2013-07-21 13:11:02
Can you elaborate about your project? What will it be?
@_date: 2013-09-07 23:53:12
Polish pensions are based on taxes actually, that are called pension funds. This money goes to current pensioners, nobody will see it in the future as we have huge demographic problems (one of the lowest birth rate in Europe).
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:31:03
I am no veteran, but that's literally what i did right now... No one has a crystal ball, but with little brain one can really well predict that a bubble will repeat and buy low enough that it doesn't really matter when he cashes out, let it be the top or even the next bottom.
