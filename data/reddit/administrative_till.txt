Can we get some context? 
If this was part of a wider criminal investigation, it makes sense.
If this was simply "because he had some bitcoin transactions in his bank account", that would throw up all sorts of other questions:
* What was the total amount cashed in?
* Why was law enforcement going through someone's bank accounts? Were they huge, frequent transactions?
* Is this about tax payments? Is this about other kinds of criminal activity?
Stringing a case together for something like this is actually pretty difficult, and there would have to be good reason to assume a successful prosecution would come from it.

so, there is no way of knowing?
I know there are some speculative tools to try to do blockchain analysis, but unless someone specifically tags their address, I don't see how they could know.
Is there a public record of 'de-anonymised' btc wallets anywhere?

Particularly if it's a personal account and not a business one.
If this person is making all their profits via trading and hasn't bothered registering a business, then they are unemployed while shifting loads of currency around. That will definitely get flagged.
I would love to hear the background story here, still.

How is it known that this is SilkRoad related?
