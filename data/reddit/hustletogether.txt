We haven't been on the gold standard since 1971....the USD is based off other currencies, treasury notes, and foreign currency reserves. Therefore the USD has a value that is being compared to other things...right?

Right now, bitcoin's price is based off of speculation. Somewhere around 20% of Coinbase's (just one exchange) userbase actually uses bitcoin for transactions and not just for holding and waiting for the price to grow (the other 80%). It is relatively unlikely that btc will replace fiat, but the potential to replace fiat is there and the possibility to it better than fiat ever has is obvious. 
In my mind, btc isn't a bubble but it's definitely risky. I think it will increase in value and if you are able to convince the general populous of its ease of use (it's not really easy to use if you're a soccer mom, so a startup would have to solve this problem), and value, then it will stabilize and risk will reduce greatly because mass adoption will occur. 
In conclusion, value must first increase, ease of use needs to increase, which will spur mass adoption, which will stabilize the price but ever so slowly drive it up.

Do you think stabilization can only occur through widespread adoption and use? It sounds to me like luck would play a huge role in getting bitcoin in the same level of volatility as major currencies. Almost like there may have to be a near perfect combination of speculation and transactional use.

But! At the same time the advantage of bitcoin is that it's programmable. So the average population doesn't have to worry about the large decimals. Nor big round numbers. 
However for them to sit back while smart people figure all that out, yes it has to be regulated. 
Another question arises and you may respond in your own time because I know it's getting late (we must be in the same time zone): can our worldwide currency be regulated but at the same time be decentralized? Or do they go hand in hand?

Let me start by saying how great of a world that would be. 
Now my question changes: in theory (because it's midnight and I have class in the morning) if every single person on earth converted their currency to bitcoin, bitcoin's market cap would in turn equal the nominal GWP (somewhere around $75 trillion) and bitcoin would be worth like...$4 or $5 million each. BUT if we didn't have any traditional currency to compare it to because the world exchanged their money for bitcoin...how would you decide the worth of 1 bitcoin? Would it be based on how hard it is to acquire 1 bitcoin? And then it is divided down to what the bread company declares their loaf is worth?

No sir, explain YOUR setup 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:04:23
Would it be advantageous at all to drive speculation to the point where bitcoin is worth a massive amount, say America's GDP, and then work toward stabilizing it? Or, if the overall goal of the bitcoin community is to see widespread adoption, work toward stabilizing now and let it naturally spike or drop where it feels most comfortable? 
This is all theoretical that we can "work" toward building speculation or stabilization to affect the price, but there are enough big players in the market that can do this. It seems that is already happening with fork decisions. 
Or if I have it wrong, are the big players working toward stabilization through the new forks?

Would you mind expanding on what you mean by your first sentence in that?

If USD didn't exist and we only traded in bitcoin, what would you buy one Big Mac for?
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:42:29
OH ok I see what you're saying. Thank you for taking the time to explain! It can be hard to wrap your mind around the theoretical. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:47:27
I'm assuming if widespread adoption of a universal currency were to happen, it would take generations for people to even understand what the value of 1 bitcoin is. Or 1 satoshi, or 1x(whatever the future holds for crypto). Would you agree? So my confusion lies in that it's hard for me, if USD didn't exist, to put a value on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:38:20
Learn how the fiat system works, learn how bitcoin works, then you will know the value point. It all matters whether the mass population will be able to see it. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:54:11
I would love a Big Mac right now and I love your offer, but you just compared BTC value to USD to deduce that your Big Mac was worth .5mBTC
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:10:45
I'm hope you don't think that convenience is the main reason early adopters want bitcoin to have widespread adoption 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:10:22
Explain that blueprint sir

I think I may buy some books tomorrow to study it. We have to remember our world is much different now since we can actually assess market price and fluctuation. Before, when there was no internet there was no way to easily assess it. As far as I know at least...
