You think I'm trying to advertise coinify? 
I merely looked at their pricing after the previous guy mentioned it but I failed to scroll further down and see the sell price is different to the buy price

So I've now made my wallets, what i dont get is how the bitcoin is stored on it. How does (whatever controls where bitcoins are) know that i have put x amount of bitcoins on this hash/wallet? And what's to stop (whatever controls where bitcoins are) from being hacked? 
Sorry if this seems like a stupid question

Sorry to keep asking you questions;
What associates the private key with the public? Is there an algorithm that just generates the private key from the public? How does the blockchain know that this private key is for that public key?

My only concern with hardware wallets is the price... I see using wallets as a form of insurance. When I insure my house, i'm not going to spend 1% of the house value let alone 10-20%.. Maybe my way of thinking is wrong on this? 
Not looking for an argument, just want to explain my way of thinking and want to know yours/others

Living in the UK it costs a lot more to invest small amounts as it's a £10 charge from the bank to transfer vs the 4% that coinbase charges. I would be using gemini if this wasn't the case :(
(I try to invest about £100 a month)

Thanks! Looking at it now, can you change from EUR to GBP on the dashboard? Also how long does it take to verify for tier 2? (if you know) Thanks for the heads up though
