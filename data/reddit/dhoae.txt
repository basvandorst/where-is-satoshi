You accusation makes no sense haha. I don’t agree that the article is bullshit. I think that the agency doing this is running a program with a complicated function to find the source that is executed by right clicking and choosing the function. Why is that so hard to believe? I also think it doesn’t matter because that’s not the main point of the article.
You’re a strange person.

If you think what I just said isn’t possible then you weren’t listening to Snowden. They’ve developed tools that make doing this easy.

Dude what is wrong with you? The only thing that you don’t know is specifically how they did it. That doesn’t mean it’s all false haha. You’re insane.

Why you do feel the need to try to insult me? I’m not saying it’s literally as easy as the article makes it seem but the point is that’s all they’ve been offered. I don’t know if you realized this or not but they’re not going to tell you how their programs work just so you can believe them about a story that obviously happened. It’s obvious that there’s more that went into finding this guy the main point is that they caught the guy and just because you don’t understand how doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. That’s the actual naive stance to take, you mug. Are you afraid they’re going to catch you?

I’m gonna need you to stop assuming what you know about me. You have a strange expectation for that an article is going to explain to you how it works and if it doesn’t then it must be fake. I’m telling you that’s a ridiculous stance. And actually if you read the article it gives you a pretty good idea of how the guy got caught. It says he didn’t do anything to hide his IP address. Apparently he thought that simply using the Tor browser would be enough. 
I personally don’t need to know the specifics and me knowing them doesn’t help the people you named. But they also aren’t relying on this article to learn those things. You’re the one who’s narrow minded if you think the government would give that away for the sake of an article. Stop saying dumb stuff to me.

Why don’t you look it up. It’s been reported by many other outlets. They’re probably simplifying how it works. Or maybe they run a problem that has the function of looking for the source code. It doesn’t say that’s the normal function of a normal browsers.

I didn’t make it up. If you literally google his name it’ll show up.  Don’t be so fuckin lazy if you have time to respond to this you have time to google his name.
