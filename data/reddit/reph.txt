I disagree with all of this. Cold storage does not protect against theft by exchange insiders. It does not protect against frac-reserve exchanges. And it does not protect against the exchange deciding to enforce some arbitrary internal or government policy that denies or at least rate-limits access to "your" coins. In short most of the fraud that happens on a regular basis in the conventional financial system is still possible, except without the government insurance (FDIC, etc), which makes the situation even worse.
Whereas when I hold the coins myself, I am the only insider &amp; there is no risk of me frac-reserving or enforcing undesirable capital controls on them. Holding them in personal cold storage eliminates most of the IT-/computer security-related risks. At this point, in percentage terms, I would bet you that more major exchanges have been pwned than individual users.

Thanks for the added background. I would still say it's an extremely aggressive strategy, which probably would not survive an audit, for something like BTC-&gt;ETH &amp; from other comments on this sub I think most tax advisers would agree. There's a stronger argument for it on something like BCH-&gt;BTC under current law. However, from what I've heard the tax reform bills (both the house and senate versions) will explicitly restrict sec 1031 to "real" property - meaning real estate - making this a prohibited strategy in 2018. So I don't recommend doing it, but if you're going to do it anyway, make sure the transaction settles in the next 3 weeks.

I disagree. It's still an attack on crypto because the court opined that coinbase must disclose things that no retail equity brokerage is providing, such as account balance, full quarterly/monthly statements, and immediate notification of purchases (rather than merely providing basis if/when the property is sold). 
This is not a case of the court merely applying equity brokerage law to the crypto world; they are overreaching that in ways that violate the privacy of many thousands of customers. In essence, the court ruled that crypto users have little to no right to financial privacy, and virtually everything that the exchange knows about their past activity must be provided to the IRS.

What has happened - and I wish this were an exaggeration, but it's really not - is that each individual arm of the US Federal government has ruled that Bitcoin is whatever allows them to regulate it the most. To the people in charge of regulating monetary instruments (FINCEN) it's money. It's property/a capital asset to the IRS. It's now at least becoming a security in the view of the SEC. It's a quasi-commodity to the CFTC. To local police, it may be considered evidence of criminal activity, subject to immediate civil forfeiture.

That is a decent quick way of explaining Adam Smith's views, but they actually were a bit more nuanced. For example in Wealth of Nations he supports having government appraisers periodically review the rent/income of all lands in the realm, and then set a tax amount based on that, rather than having a much simpler flat tax per acre that would be far cheaper to administer and easier to compute.

Maybe it's excessively cynical but I do find it hard to believe that only ~800 people have reported a Federal capital gain or loss since 2013. One wonders if they did the most naive possible scan for that to improve their argument in court, i.e. by only searching schedule Ds for "bitcoin" instead of also checking for "btc", "cryptocurrency", "virtual currency", "digital currency", "magic internet money", etc. There is surely underreporting happening, but 9,999,200+ out of 10,000,000+ stretches belief.

This is exactly correct. USD supply inflation is ~8%/yr or more by the Fed's own data (in a non-crisis year), which is basically why the equity market can return 6%/yr+ over long time periods (without some other asset class declining by a similar amount). In general 5-6% goes to current shareholders &amp; 2-3% goes to senior management in the form of dilution/new shares.
The system relies on wage suppression (outsourcing, layoffs, no-raise-4-u, etc), technology improvements and some manipulation to keep the CPI below 8%.

I think the idea here is that you'll still have a "hot wallet" on the phone with, say, $100  that can be spent with just 1 signature. These coins can be stolen if the phone/privkey is lost &amp; the passphrase can be successfully determined.
To minimize that risk - but still allow quick access to way more than $100 - you can keep, say, $5k in "warm storage" with the multisig/third-party-video-call approach that OP proposed.
The rest of your holdings can be held offline in cold storage &amp; converted into warm storage as needed.

For scalability, it's still better to have a larger number of smaller blocks, i.e. a 1kB block every 60s instead of a 10kB block every 600s. This is becaues the confirmation security is mainly a function of block count, not elapsed time. 6 confirmations w/ a 60s block is as secure (as difficult to successfully attack) as 6 confirmations w/ a 600s block.
Thus, the high block time in Bitcoin is, basically, a delay without much benefit given that virtually every miner/pool can easily transfer a 100kB+ block in &lt;=10s. Yeah, the guy in the Outback on a 1200 baud satellite link will get orphans/stales, but that's no reason to make the rest of the world wait 30 minutes at an ATM!

Altcoins are too risky. Real estate is a hugely overvalued scam. The US stock market is overbid by at least 25-30%. The US dollar supply is expanding 8-10%/yr while paying only 1% interest and most other fiat currencies are equally bad or worse.

All of that may be true, but if you owned an exchange that had 100k BTC that other people were willing to sell for $100/ea (either out of panic, or some deception on your part, whatever), and you could buy them for $10M using personal funds, and immediately re-sell them for $40-60M on Bitstamp - why wouldn't you take that arb? It is easy money. The only reason you wouldn't take it is if it is not possible: because the exchange does not actually have the BTC, or, you (and other insiders) do not have the fiat. Fiat, being very easy to borrow, is less likely to be the constraint, hence my guess that the exchange just does not have the BTC.

With Bitcoin, it's not so clear cut as it would be w/ a traditional precious metal or fiat system, where inflation is basically orthogonal to transaction processing. In Bitcoin, the monetary-base inflation is primarily incentivizing the proper operation of the p2p network, enabling it to weather major attacks, remain secure, and execute transactions "correctly", so it is perfectly legitimate to consider the block reward (and thus, the coin supply expansion) an "indirect transaction fee".
In fact that's really a major part of the genius of Bitcoin.
I agree though that the block reward is not *purely* a transaction fee; it's paid even when there are no other (non-block-reward) transactions in the block.

If every coin is held, no USD inflow is needed at all to keep the (public exchange) price constant. Of course, some mined coins will likely be sold to cover electricity and other operating costs, but the question then is how many, when, and what effect will that have on the price/order book, and how much of that effect is "already priced in". In any event, it's definitely not clear that we absolutely need $875M to flow into the exchanges just to keep the BTCUSD constant over that period. In a relatively illiquid asset class such as Bitcoin, the price is driven primarily by "the flow" (actual transactions on the exchange), not by "the supply", so to speak.

It'd be $30M of personal profit for whoever takes my example arbitrage opportunity. It's no longer part of the exchange; it's their personal funds that they can use to buy a private island or whatever, even if the exchange itself collapses, enters bankruptcy, etc. The arb itself was perfectly legal - the guy paid $10M for the BTC, he didn't just steal them.
In short, I don't know why any owner/manager would leave massively undervalued BTC in the asset column of a failing exchange. Better to buy it with your personal account, flip it on Bitstamp for a massive personal profit, and leave a small amount of fiat in the exchange instead, for people to fight over in a 2+ year bankruptcy court battle.
But of course, if the exchange does not actually have any real (blockchain-backed) Bitcoins, that's not possible.

This is a large blessing but also a small curse in that it makes an existing BTC position very hard to hedge right now (in the US).
One of the benefits of an ETF is that it will hopefully lead to a somewhat liquid options market. OTOH an ETF may also increase the correlations, at least during a panic.

The State is the Alpha Predator - the most-successful protection racket. As a result, if you can destroy it somehow, there will be a power vacuum &amp; subsequent competition amongst the next-most-Alpha predators to replace it with another State. The French revolution is an example of what happens when "The People" dissolve a "Bad State", and chaos ensues until another State regains dominance. Iraq is another more recent example.
Anyway, as long as violent sociopaths are sexually successful, there will always be a State of some form. Technology cannot change Nature.

In the fiat money system, leaf-node fraud (a local bank failure or robbery) is merely socialized through central bank fraud (money printing to bail out the FDIC when it runs out of money bailing out bad banks that ran out of money).
In essense, it's welfare for fraudsters at all levels, rebranded as "protection for the masses". Everyone smart enough to properly secure their own funds is getting robbed a little bit through currency debasement, so that no serious effort need be made to track down criminals and recover the "money" that they stole.
It is not a system that, on the whole, truly benefits the honest masses.

I am sure they put some thought into this, but on the surface I am concerned about the added solvency/clearing risk.
If a large tx gets double spent, a buyer on the xchg could end up "owning" Bitcoins that the exchange does not have. Would they reverse the trade? Socialize the loss?

He's wrong though; those in power always want full-spectrum dominance, which in a currency regime includes the ability not just to track, but to expand or contract the supply by any amount, delay or deny transactions before they settle and/or to tax them at any rate, and to be able to seize any/all hodl'd assets for any reason through a mere keypress. So Bitcoin, while significantly closer than some alts, is still nowhere near a statist's ideal currency.

I respect vinnylingham as an entrepreneur, but those statements are seriously confused..
 1. A stock split does not affect the market cap; in a 2:1 split 10 shares @ $10/ea become 20 shares @ $5/ea, etc. This is not the same as dilution (issuance of new shares) or inflation (issuance of new currency).
 2. The inflation rate of Bitcoin is deterministic and extremely well-known, and is certainly factored into the exchange rate by both buyers and sellers.

I always enjoy reading your analysis &amp; agree with most of it, except WRT the benefit &amp; viability of a switching to a different hash function. Perhaps that would have worked in 2011 but now most of the hashpower is in &lt;=28nm fixed-function ASICs. Even if miners were willing to spend the money to tape out a new ASIC for a new algo (which is unlikely during a contentious fork), it would take 3+ months to get them fabbed and running at a rate appropriate for a $5B cryptocurrency.
A fork of a $100k shitcoin could probably change algos &amp; survive on CPU/GPU/FPGA mining for a while as you're suggesting, but that won't cut it for 2016 Bitcoin.
What would probably happen instead is that the fork that's bleeding hashpower would have to adjust the block interval, retarg interval, and/or retarg algo to keep the network reasonably operational. That would of course make it even less like pre-fork Bitcoin and, perhaps, help seal the victory of the competing fork.

It's a legitimate suboptimality; the notional value of the currency is $3.8B but for around $5000/day (0.00013%) you can significantly affect tx timing &amp; fees for everyone using it. This probably means that a) the average (pre-attack) fees were too low and/or b) the block size is too small.
The next spammer could be much better-funded than this one, so some improvements would be beneficial. Increasing default fees in the major clients would be the best short-term improvement IMO, and as you can see, some of them already have. Increasing the block size would be good too (IMO), although that is clearly much more controversial.

The hint looks a bit too extensive IMO. The accurate capitalization in particular encourages a dictionary attack, if the attacker reasonably assumes that each capital is the start of a common English word &amp; each lower-case letter is the end of one.

If I can control 51% of global SHA256 hashpower - over time - I have the option of determining whether *every* disputed transaction should be accepted or purged from the log. You said it yourself: the truth is in the longest blockchain.
Of course, a coalition of &gt;50% might not form when the network splits. Say there are 2 large transactions in dispute: up to 4 coalitions may form with different opinions about whether one, both, or neither of them should be purged from the blockchain. If one coalition can organize the majority of the worldwide hash power - they have the power to decide "the truth".
Today there is also a central override, which exists as long as users (mainly: the USD/BTC exchanges) continue to trust the bitcoin.org developers, and are willling to update to a new release from them. A new version of the client can simply "hardcode" the developers' version of the truth, by requiring certain hashes on certain blocks and rejecting other blockchains, even if they are longer. This has been used at least once to revert fraudulent transactions. But again, it requires continued trust in *some* developer.
And, as always, trust in a central entity is also a vulnerability.
If the bitcoin.org client is compromised - you would quickly see a large number of other cracked/backdoored bitcoin binaries from Black Hat devs competing for suckers/users. Some of them with very polished websites, fake users posting fake positive reviews, etc. The average user would have no idea which client(s) - let alone which blockchain(s) - are truly legit. The BTC/USD would probably plummet.
@_date: 2012-12-14 07:54:36
I love Bitcoin, but it is near-propaganda to say that "nobody controls bitcoin". The official client devs could release a pwned version that sends all of your coins to them as soon as you upgrade to it.
There is certainly still a "trusted central entity" with Bitcoin, unless you are personally compiling &amp; auditing the source code for every version you run.

Yep. I guess my point is that the widespread trust in Bitcoin stems from the social credibility of developers who have audited the *source code*. But the majority of users - possibly even the major exchanges - are running probably-unaudited *binaries* built by a central entity. And at least in theory, that would be a lovely attack vector.
@_date: 2012-12-17 05:14:09
In order to make a real profit as a miner, you either need a MH/J advantage - e.g. FPGAs when everybody else has GPUs - and/or a cost-of-electricity advantage. There is no other way.
If you're running the same ASICs as everyone else - paying an average electricity cost - you are not going to make money, long term.
I invested in FPGAs a year ago and got a ~2X return, but if I had invested in BTC directly, it would have been more like 4-5X. At this point, I would buy BTC directly instead of investing in ASIC mining HW.
Even better - start a Bitcoin-related business and help the ecosystem grow. ;)

Previously mined coins could then be multiply-spent by anyone with access to both areas. In other words, anyone holding coins is incentivized to a) get access to both areas, and b) prevent everyone else from getting access to both areas.

No one can "stop" the main currency and replace it with two new ones, unless it's being centrally controlled. What you described would not be possible w/ Bitcoin (I hope). You can allow Bitcoin users to convert 1 Bitcoin into 0.87 of a NewCoinA or 0.17 of a NewCoinB, or whatever, but you cannot prevent them from creating more transactions on the now-split Bitcoin network(s).
It would be quite a mess.

If the bitcoin.org developers were Pure Evil - they could have added this trojan horse to all of their binaries over the past 2 years (but not to the public source, obviously). 
If they activate this hypothetical trojan and Steal All Teh Coinz (almost atomically) -  outside of a few dozen people who enjoy spending a weekend in an x86 disassembler - it would not be clear which builds are trustworthy. Users cannot simply downgrade, because there might be a trojan in every prior binary.
Of course - some honest developers would quickly build honest binaries from audited source. Dishonest developers would also push dishonest binaries in the hopes of getting them widely adopted. Most users will not be able to tell which developer(s) are trustworthy and which are not. As always: smart, evil people will find ways to deceive and rob the ignorant.
Perhaps we should be encouraging as many users as possible to learn C++, and audit and build their own client from source. Arming the populace against tyranny. Yet the truth is that few will be willing to do so.

You are correct that large miners cannot change the block reward, or do certain other nefarious things that violate rules in the bitcoin client. But the Bitcoin client is ultimately a computer program, and cannot distinguish "honest transactions" from "theft".
Miners do have discretion over whether or not to include transactions that *follow the rules used by the rest of the network*. For a thief, the "rules" used by the majority of bitcoin clients matters less than the "rules" used by the major BTC/USD &amp; BTC/EUR exchanges. Say you can somehow compromise the bitcoin.org binaries to generate valid (fully signed) transactions that covertly send users' coins to you. You'll want to steal as many coins as possible, then get that notional wealth out of the Bitcoin ecosystem as fast as possible (6 blocks).
If the theft is quickly detected - a few large, honest miners could install a client that delays blockchain inclusion of the fraudulent transactions (even though they follow all of "the rules") . That buys a little time for the exchanges to upgrade to a new client that "hardcodes them out". [Of course, the fraudulent transactions would be mixed in with legitimate transactions and it would be exceptionally hard for the people undoing the theft to tell them apart, but let's assume there is some sane solution for that for a moment].
I think this would still be a very harmful - possibly fatal - situation for Bitcoin.
There is no automated update infrastructure that would allow a coordinated bitcoin client upgrade to thwart the thief's rapid exit into other asset classes. And of course - no SW developer coud "undo" the crime after it's exited the Bitcoin ecosystem. You need competent Law Enforcement goons to find and seize the gold bullion, guns, or whatever the wealth has been converted into at that point.

Consider buying mining gear with the USD, or investing in a GLBSE mining company, instead of exchanging USD-&gt;BTC directly. Of course, all 3 options have different pros/cons, but if you don't need all the coins ASAP, it might make sense. I prefer to hold HW that I can repurpose or resell if Bitcoin goes bust, over holding a lot of BTC directly.

The problem here is how do you define an erroneous trade? If I buy $10k @ $500 and then the price drops to $400 ten minutes later, can I e-mail them and say the trade was "erroneous" and have it reversed? How about an hour later? 2 days later? What if it was a $100k trade? What if it's a 10 BTC trade but it executed at a 50% higher VWAP than other exchanges because their order book is so thin, and I was too dumb to check that first? Does it matter if I was on the Harvard rowing team or not?

I think the concern is that users generally pick BIP38 passphrases that are significantly weaker than a randomly generated EC privkey. An 8-12 character alphanumeric string for instance is a much easier attack surface than the key itself.

Since nobody's gone full nerd on this yet, I guess I'll step up. To be [technically correct]( - you can mine BTC on other planets, but you're gonna get some orphans/stales. However: due to variance: not all of your blocks will be orphaned, even if you are well outside of the 5 minute light cone. You *will* be mining and contributing to one common interplanetary chain, just inefficiently. If your elec is cheaper and/or your tech is better than on the "majority hashpower" planet, though, you may actually still be quite profitable. It's an overstatement to say it is "not feasible to mine Bitcoin (at all) on other planets" with a &gt;5min one-way delay.

Sure, but you can only short what you can borrow, which is not very much at the moment. You cannot control 'the entirety of the currency' for the short sale.
Even mining for a month with 51% would only give you about 50k BTC, one day's volume on the large exchanges. Barely enough to start another 1-day sheep-shearing sell-off &amp; recovery.

Bitcoin is a very small, thinly-traded currency relative to everything else in that table. Solid engineering and a rapid rise in popularity have allowed high % appreciation in the first couple years.
But: the Bitcoin supply is going to increase 12.50% this year. The above-ground gold and silver supply are more or less constant, growing at ~1-2%. Even the USD - constantly accused of being on the edge of hyperinflation - is expanding at "only" 6-8% [shadowstats M2].
Unless Bitcoin can continue its rapid growth in credibility and popularity amongst investors - its "hoarding value" - it is likely to decline a little bit vs the USD, and especially vs precious metals in 2013.
Or maybe I just want it to go down so I can buy more. ;)

Actually, that is false when you consider large transaction volumes.
If there are only 10M bitcoins in existance, and I could acquire virtually all of them, for, let's say, $150M, there is no way to move more than $150M through the Bitcoin network.
1 person wanting $150M of Bitcoins is a bit unlikely - but let's say we run a Superbowl ad and suddenly 150M people want $1 worth of Bitcoins to send to their friends overseas, use for reddit bitcointips, etc. Same market cap problem.
Especially since most coins are "saved"/"hoarded" right now, and not available on a currency exchange at any price.

IMO the USD and EUR will continue to bleed gradually, 8-10% a year. They are literally too big to hyperinflate.
Hyperinflation usually happens to relatively new fiat currencies, with a small money supply. The USD is a mature fiat currency with a huge money supply, and the Fed is simply not printing fast enough to cause hyperinflation (50% monthly). That would take over 5 trillion a month!

It's a circle-jerk. The Fed's treasuries are valuable largely because the Fed is constantly buying treasuries. The flow sets the price (the worth) of the stock. They are purchasing something like 75% of the new 30yr issuance.
Anyway, the apparent value of the bond is totally immaterial to whether QE is inflationary (i.e. expanding the USD supply). I could give you a bad drawing of a unicorn, and if you create and give me $100M USD for it, which I immediately spend into the real economy, that is inflationary.
The inflation is only cancelled out - at a later date - if you can convince someone else to give you $100M back for it, and you then burn or destroy those dollars (or at least hoard them forever so that their velocity is 0, and they effectively do not exist in the real economy)

I think that is a bit unfair - CD does not understand Bitcoin very well, but his points about the ponzi paper paradigm of "creating value out of nothing" should at least give you pause if you want to value Bitcoin fairly and objectively.
There's a case to be made that gold/silver are the better long-term stores-of-value; Bitcoin is nonetheless an extremely innovative and useful medium-of-exchange.
@_date: 2013-01-10 08:51:20
The daily volume on MtGox is around 15,000 - 30,000BTC, so the fate of the 3,600BTC mined each day (whether they are hoarded, vs being dumped on an exchange ASAP) still has some effect on the BTCUSD. Of course as the exchange volume grows, mining will become less influential.
@_date: 2013-12-21 04:34:46


Only if you believe in creative accounting. The US govt gives the Fed a treasury bond (via a bankster primary dealer), and then spends the USD they receive into the real economy, expanding the USD supply in circulation, and bidding up labor and assets.
It is true that the new USD will eventually be taxed, partly offseting its impact, but it's also true that new bonds are continually issued, as needed, to fund seemingly unlimited deficits. Right now the net effect is inflationary. [US M1 is expanding at around 8.4%/yr](
US M2 expanded by $626.6B between Nov 2012 and Nov 2013.
QE is not the only cause, but it is a substantial one.

I'm making money today with FPGAs only because most of the network is still using GPUs. Thus, I have a ~10X MH/J advantage (which more than compensates for my ~2-3X $/kwhr disadvantage).
Once most miners have similar ASIC HW (same MH/J), mining will be profitable only in areas with the cheapest electricity. And the best returns will go to the guys making the ASICs.
1. ASIC vendors can and probably will set up their own mining operations, and compete with (and undercut) their own HW customers.
2. Large miners will have lower capex (since they are buying in high volume) and lower opex (cheaper electricity) - since they are willing to set up farms in low-cost states like WA.
IMO most of the "small miners" on ASIC waitlists are going to get pwned over the next couple months as difficulty rises.

Most businesses require a large pool of real capital to start. Inflation eats into the ability of entrepreneurs to accumulate that capital themselves, making them more dependent on loans from large banks, which is, of course, the point.

You're looking at the short-term notes, where I agree, the Fed is currently not active w/ QE. But as I said above, they are &gt;50% of the market on some of the longer duration stuff (10yr, 30yr, etc).
I would not want to be holding anything there as the Fed bid disappears. They are smart enough to withdraw gradually, even so, it's going to hurt unless there is a corresponding decline in supply (due to a smaller federal deficit).

It will happen sooner or later IMO. Over the next 12-24 months, BitPay and similar services  will spend a ton of VC money, get a bunch of slick sales guys, get a few thousand customers, and then, the VCs/other investors will start demanding a return on investment. So the 0.10% fees will become 0.50% fees and then 2.95% fees because "we're still cheaper than paypal". Alternatively: some US law enforcement agency will force them to block a Wikileaks-like customer, do some Super Evil PayPal-style account seizures, etc.
Customers will get pissed off, and eventually a decent SW developer will build a solid BSD/MIT-licensed open source software package that makes it easy for vendors to use bitcoin without a third-party payment processor. MtGox will continue to become easier to use &amp; will handle BTC/USD exchanges, when needed.
Basically these VCs just burned half a million dollars on a business model with no long-term future. The good news is that at least it will help the bitcoin ecosystem grow.
@_date: 2013-01-09 04:27:46
TBH, I don't understand your point. My business could accept Paypal for a while, then decide to stop accepting Paypal &amp; migrate to e-checks, authorize.net, or whatever instead.

If you have no EE/CS background and want a working ASIC in less than 5 years - you need enough skills to get a few hundred k USD to pay seasoned ASIC engineer(s) to design it for you. Plus maybe 50-100k USD for the development SW (unless you can find a way to warez that, which is probably tough), plus a few hundred k for manufacturing.
You could save money by building a crappier ASIC on an even older process, but, if it has a lower MH/J than a 28nm FPGA, what's the point?

"Valuable" is qualitative, but I do think that in a perfectly free market (w/o QE), there would have been some UST auction failures and/or much higher 30yr rates by now, as the private sector (and other governments) are not interested in buying the whole issuance at the current rates.

1. The BTCUSD exchange liquidity is adequate for a $5k position, but if you want to hold $500k worth of BTC, you do have to consider that it'll take 10 months to withdraw w/ the highest MtGox limit. That's rediculously illiquid compared to mainstream forex &amp; equity markets.
2. The higher limits help but they're still insufficient for the very wealthy (a problem I wish I had...)
3. OK.
4. I agree a long-term internet outage is quite unlikely, but Bitcoin's technological complexity is still a disadvantage/risk vs precious metals.
5. OK.
6. OK.
7. Take a look at what they did to online casinos. Yes - with a US govt ban - BTC&lt;-&gt;USD exchange would still be possible in person/over-the-counter. But that's a big PITA and it would certainly reduce Bitcoin's value [much of the current demand is US-based].
8. OK.
9. As a saver, I'll always prefer a ~2% expansion over a ~12.5 or 6.25% expansion. Asteroid mining is not a serious risk to PMs over the next 10 years.
10. "bitcoin has outperformed gold by about 200% in the last year."

Private buyers have other options: corp bonds, equities, etc with potentially better risk/reward, and it is not clear at all that the private sector money would flow into USTs at the required rate to run a $1T/yr deficit.
In a totally free market, if the supply exceeds that demand, and the supplier (the federal government) refuses to budge on price (in this case, the interest rate), the auction would fail. 
With open-ended QE, the Fed more or less acts as a buyer of last resort &amp; vacuums up any leftover supply, at a price that is quite favorable to the UST.

OTOH Bitcoin has certain disadvantages vs precious metals:
1. Not as widely accepted / far less liquid.
2. Tigher currency/exchange restrictions ($1k/day MtGox limit).
3. Cannot be made into jewelry. ;)
4. Infrastructural/technological risk. Gold is still valuable if the power grid/internet goes down due to a solar flare, EMP, or whatever.
5. Might be unheard of / worthless in 10 years. Or 25 years. Or 50 years. [Gold has been valuable for over 5000 years].
6. Slower transactions. I can go to a local coin store and sell a gold coin in 10 minutes. BTC-&gt;MtGox-&gt;Dwolla-&gt;Bank-&gt;ATM and vice versa takes around 5 days. Yes, there are some faster options, but they are expensive (2-3%+ fees).
7. Legal/regulatory risk. The US government is more likely to shut down and/or regulate Bitcoin exchanges than Gold/Silver exchanges.
8. Bitcoins are not easily insurable.
9. The Bitcoin supply is expanding faster (~12.5%/yr) than the above-ground silver supply (~2%/yr).

Well, this is a classic debate in ecomonics. There are good arguments both ways, but personally I do not think that "price solves all liquidity problems".
Human psychology creates certain constraints. For instance, most people are not going to be able or willing to pay $1000 for a single Bitcoin in 2013. So with 10M coins the market cap is limited to &lt;= $10B USD today, which is actually still quite small if we are going to handle 150M users.
Divisibility - asking users to pay $1 for a millibitcoin instead of $1000 for a Bitcoin - helps, but I'm not sure it fixes it completely. Will average new users accept that $1 only buys 1/1000th of this newfangled Bitcoin thing they saw on TV?
