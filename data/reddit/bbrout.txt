Zooming out to one month still looks like a triangle formation. If so, this will go on for a while. Don't expect a breakout either up or down any time soon. However, it's Bitcoin. It could do anything.

Rule 
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:11:01
Chances are it'll bounce off of $10.2 k or around there then test about $12.8 k. Personally, I don't think BTC is going outside that range for a while. There may well be some blood on the charts but not for too long. Then again, TA hasn't done that well. Hey, anyone remember that fractal stuff a while back?
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:24:27
TA has been used in previous types of equity markets and, historically, you'd do better throwing darts at a stock market page of the NY Times. With crypto, there's an attempt to try to understand a very new type of market. So TA can maybe be useful if supported with a semblance of sound reasoning. It's most useful in hindsight. Hope that helps.

It may still be in the wedge. It has not yet broken out. Be careful. Usually a breakout is more of a wandering up or down out of the envelope rather than a sudden surge. But then again, it's Bitcoin. No one knows what is going on.

Technically we are still in a wedge. However there are some faint indications of a possible upward break out beginning to form. Volume is increasing while price us rising. Any large investor will have lost out on discounted prices if this pans to be true.

Obvious sausage formation.
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:38:37
Still narrowing in a wedge/triangle. I honestly thought it was a breakout a couple of weeks ago.  Although there is no criteria other than what it looks like, the year long chart is a classic monster wedge. If so, volume will continue to drop and highs and lows will continue to narrow. A breakout can be declared at a price greater than $20k or lower than $6k. It will hit one or the other but not both.

@_date: 2019-03-08 15:45:24
Real future markets deliver the commodites traded when the contract completes. Crypto futures only deliver fiat and do not deliver the crypto on contract completion. It is impossible to buy the promised crypto on the spot without driving up the price forcing the long side to buy at an inflated price from the promised price. This gives a large advantage to the short side of the contract. Shorts can sell on the future and drive price down with high speed trades in the spot since spot price and not discovered delivery price determines the settlement. 
tl;dr crypto futures are not a fair market.

Personally I think the market is discovering a fair value. It could take years. And the value changes with the use case. Gradually the market may show that Bitcoin is undervalued. And no amount of manipulation can overcome that. At this stage the use case will probably determine price. I agree with your analysis in the short term. I'd be careful of the word "short" there.

Been saying it for some time. Buyers try to manipulate price down. Sellers try to manipulate price up. Buyers are selling. Sellers are buying. They are really just bots. Gradually they run out of ammunition. This causes a typical triangle or wedge formation. Not a good time to invest either way. Eventually the price will "wander" out of the envelope of the wedge. Both side try to trick the market that a breakout is happening. Theoretically it should wander out over time. However, please remember, it's Bitcoin. Nobody knows what is going on.

Absolutely correct. But I think we've all learned, you don't fight evil with more evil. You don't fight chaos by creating more chaos.

@_date: 2018-10-27 21:34:03
It's still too soon. It's a little promising but still way too soon. When it hits $9K then there is a possibility it is breaking out of the wedge. Low volume does not equal instability it seems.

@_date: 2018-10-02 02:39:14
Triangles or wedges I indicate a "battle" between buyers and sellers to set a price. The buyers are selling the price down and the sellers are buying the price up. They are doing the opposite of what is usual. The buyers have lots of money but limited commodity. The sellers have lots of commodity but limited money. Hence, each side eventually runs out of ammunition to move the market to their desired price. This is common in   many markets. But hey ... it's Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:59:26
If it helps, there are two different ways of valuing money. Financial institutions value money for what it can buy, Marxists value money as how hard you have to work to get the stuff. Since, except for forking, you have to work to get bitcoin, it is much more valuable than credit. Also, since bitcoin can be exchanged for any currency, it is an excellent candidate for a global reserve currency. Having a fiat currency for a global reserve currency is a really bad idea. This is a simplified view; nevertheless I believe it's behind the increase in global acceptance of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:14:35
There is also the aspect of a global reserve currency. Over and above a national currency there is a need for a mutually agreed on global currency. If you travel from England to Mexico you have problems getting pesos from a British bank or selling pounds in Mexico. It is much easier to buy USD in England and sell them for pesos upon landing. That s why the USD is king among currencies. However it all relies on trust in the USD. Along comes.bitcoin and the game changes. 
Bitcoin actually relieves pressure on the USD; it is not a threat to it. Furthermore, consider the USD as the global currency of settlement. Almost all international strike.prices are In  USD even though no actual US cash is involved. The use of crypto currencies with futures contracts is extremely promising. 
Bitcoin as a global reserve and Ethereium as a global currency of settlement looks like a pretty good marriage.

@_date: 2018-10-02 01:14:36
When each swing fails to obtain a profit greater than the fees involved, then trading will all but die. The price will then wander or drift slowly up or down with very little volume. When this "drifting" establishes a recognizable trend, then that will be interpreted as a breakout. Either up or down. At least that is the usual script. But hey, it's Bitcoin. Good friggin' luck trying to predict it.

Backup a wallet then restore with one of your wallet.dat files. If it takes it, good; if not, try the other wallet.dat. If you restore on a wallet with Bitcoin already on the wallet, you lose those Bitcoins. Always back up first or transfer to a second wallet. Only restore to an empty wallet.

@_date: 2019-08-30 01:19:29
To meet your obligation at the contract close, you have to deliver the contacted commodity. Either dollars or the commodity at the agreed upon price. Usually a long contract is closed out by selling another contract and they cancel resulting in a profit or loss. However it does happen that a contract is not closed out and delivery of the commodity is demanded. In that case the seller (short) has to scramble and buy the complete contract (lots if it) to meet the obligation. If there is no obligation to deliver, and the spot market is thin enough to sell down, then seller is at a huge advantage since the number of dollars required is less than the profit from the margin (or leverage). In the other side of the deal, the buyer wants the Bitcoin yet cannot force the seller to deliver. The seller can force the buyer to deliver dollars and the buyer is stuck with having to force a settlement in a commodity he is trying to get rid of (dollars). It's just gambling against people who can sell the spot down. Notice how the price of Bitcoin has returned to where it was a month ago. If it had risen, the longs on the CME futures exchange would be rekt. They have to sell Bitcoin to each other at a loss on each transaction to hammer down the price at contract end. Because no Bitcoin has to be delivered, it does not take very much of the commodity to do this.

Well, somehow a couple of wallet.dat files got onto that thumb drive. And you need a wallet to be able to send Bitcoin to Coinbase. And you you can't back up a Coinbase wallet onto a thumb drive. So, at some time in the past, you had a bitcoin wallet and a lightening wallet. Or else those wallet.dat files comes from someplace else. How many email addresses and phone numbers do you have? Coinbase started in 2012. OK, so, please tell me, what operating system are you using? And what version?

@_date: 2019-08-18 23:25:28

Yup. I personally think that was out and out fraud.
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:36:48
I don't think anyone knows what it means. Nevertheless, the spot price of Bitcoin has always returned to the price of such gaps. It may take a month or two, but the gap has always been filled. It suggests very strongly that the CME has found a way to drive down the price of the spot in order to de-rekt their short customers. On the surface, there doesn't appear to be any known reason for such gaps to be filled unless the CME futures market is not a fair market.

As I understand it, the repo crisis results from lending banks turning down borrowing institutions using bonds as collateral within the repo market. This is as a result of the collapse of the bond market with negative rates. Treasury bonds may still have some value but other bonds don't according to the lenders. Why the hell don't they use Bitcoin for collateral and save the repo market?

In very simple terms, if the price is high enough, the hodlers will sell. That could be as much as a whopping 60% of the market not counting lost coins.

According to the incredibly convoluted and bizarre dating of the CME, contracts expire on the Monday prior to the third Wednesday of the March quarter. That might possibly be the 17th. But hey, the CME is harder to figure than Bitcoin itself. March was around $4k somewhere. A consistent short position will lose a shitload. Unless, through a massive onslaught of high frequency trading, the spot can be driven to$4k in a week.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:49:50
Fer sher. CME boss says he will "tame Bitcoin" back in the heyday. CME created a fake futures market. Without going into details of how a futures market works, there must be delivery of the commodity to ensure a "fair" market. It keeps everyone honest. However, CME says the contract will be settled in cash according to the price determined by five exchanges. But a long contract cannot possibly receive the amount of commodity at the settlement price since, after getting the settlement cash, trying to buy that amount of commodity on the spot market will increase the price and the buyer, or holder of the long contract, has to pay considerably more for the commodity than the agreed price in the contract. 
However, if that was not enough to ensure the CME is not providing a "fair" market and has given the short side of a cash settled contract a huge advantage, the people buying long don't realise that the people selling in the future can have Bitcoin in their pockets and through trading rooms, much like troll rooms but on exchanges, trade Bitcoin back and forth to themselves, driving down the price and securing profits for their short contracts.
Basically, the CME can steal from people buying long contracts and use that money to sell down the price. Everything seems to point to that being true. It is illegal. The SEC is supposed to police this kind of thing. Americans have been robbed for billions of dollars.
The above is merely a conjecture which you may take as a form of entertainment on this thread.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:32:44
Just check the closing dates of the CME Bitcoin futures contracts. It's on their web page. Usually there is a significant drop two days before the last Thursday of the month, which is usually the closing date of the contract. Unless there is a holiday.

There is also a lot of talk on BTC being used as an international reserve currency. Just saying.

It's more of a longer term trend. Monthly chart showed it better last month. Short term those who invest in stocks may also buy some BTC. However, drops in the DOW lately (month ago) correspond to large buys in Bitcoin. It's worth watching. I wouldn't rely on it.

Sorry, it's the opposite. From the twin paradox, the traveling twin ages more slowly than the twin staying home. The traveling twin can only age and mine for a short time while the remaining twin ages and can mine for many years. Traveling clocks slow down compared to stationary clocks. (Actually, there are acceleration effects because the traveling twin has to turn around and come back). This is the reason for the remainers in the Brexit debate. They get more Bitcoin.

This is worth pursuing. Thanks for excellent input. If the futures buyer is unaware that the seller has a store of commodity and an organization, either at arm's length or not, and through such means has every intent, and actually has done so, of driving down the price on the spot at the time of completion of the contract, then it would not be a fair market according to our definitions. 
That being said, if the buyer is unaware that without delivery of the commodity, a cash settlement would not allow the buyer to buy the commodity at the agreed price and is therefore greatly disadvantaged in the trade, that would be unfair. The CME has to make it very clear that under a cash settlement, the buyer cannot possibly receive the agreed amount of Bitcoin at agreed price. And, they must make very clear that the seller can definitely get the agreed number of dollars at the agreed upon price. IMHO this is still a rip-off and a scam, but the regulators could use the excuse of buyer beware.
The regulators are responsible for ensuring the transparancy of the trade. (Yes they are). If the seller, or CME employees or personnel, are running, or colluding with, a BTC trading room on the spot, then they should be busted. If the regulators are colluding with the CME or vie versa, the regulators should be busted.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:45:25
Excellent question. Here is a link: 
There is a one-minute "window" onto the exchanges involved. The cash settlement price is calculated in that time window. From what I see, it's between 14:59:00 and 15:00:00 to calculate a volume weighted price average. That's central time. However, it is unclear if the day that calculation is done is on the Friday or Thursday. Here is a link to more information: 
It's important to get the information directly from the source, the CME itself, rather than listen to conjecture. Some of it makes sense and some of it doesn't.
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:26:06
It's Bitcoin. It could go anywhere. Last time there was a trade war. That seems to have cooled off. Asians may take profits or they may jump in or they may completely ignore it. Or something else may happen. Unless...
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:04:14
Depends. Where you keeping your HODL?
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:55:02
I'm looking mostly at the last month. There is a decent inverse correlation between the DOW and BTC. I think we can interpret that as an indication investors in NYSE stocks find BTC a "store of value" to hedge dropping stock prices. The China/US trade play seems to have influenced stock prices which in turn seems to have influenced the price of BTC. IMHO.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:44:44
Careful of the dead cat. Patience and go for the long term. Not panicking is the key. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic.
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:07:17
Agreed. It may be that BTC is driving the market rather than the market driving BTC. It's just a conjecture, but it would make sense. Anyway, I think it's worth keeping an eye on it. There may be absolutely no correlation at all.
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:32:53
Not the point. If u R using a trezor for a HODLe, where are you keeping your trezor? BTW, just a question. Don't post the answer.
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:09:12
It may have settled yesterday. The price is listed as $7678. That may have been the settlement price. I think the contracts close on a Thursday.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:33:51
Not yet by a long shot. Patience. Think in terms of 12.5k to 10.5k. Then maybe.

It's a triangle.

Didn't this also happen on a Sunday last time?
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:45:17
BTC will probably be a global standard while countries could still have currencies. It's kind of like Bitcoin itself; no one knows what is going to happen.
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:07:13
Now that you mention it, some of the posts lately seem intelligent and well thought out. And yup, that's kinda different. We should keep an eye on it.

The problem isn't the money; the problem is your marriage. Do you have kids? Talk to your wife. Discuss together about dealing with money. You trust complete unknowns on Reddit for advice and don't trust your lady. I have no idea what your relationship is like. It sounds like you don't either. Sorry for being harsh and direct.

The DOW has gone up about 2000 points over the last month. Just saying.

@_date: 2019-06-30 15:19:31
Even though, relatively, the volume is receding during this consolidation, there is still a hell of a lot of money being thrown around. It looks like some major players are involved. We saw this before not that long ago.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:13:54
I'm from the 60s. What's Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:44:12
This is one of the most important points about Bitcoin. Almost all of it is locked up by hodlers. And they will not sell until the price is high enough. And may not even then. If BTC becomes the global reserve currency, and there is more and more a chance of that happening, then the hodlers will loosen their load. Surprisingly, Bitcoin didn't do anything to go toe to toe with the American dollar. Bitcoin doesn't care and doesn't have to actually do anything. If Bitcoin has integrity, the world becomes attracted to it. In the end, Bitcoin will save the American dollar. All of the manipulation of Bitcoin is nothing compared to the manipulation of the American dollar. The price means very little at this stage.
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:40:09
That is actually a rather valuable ally. Ignoring the downside can be disastrous. There is always risk and seeing consequences is vital. Like, maxing out your credit cards and triple mortgaging your house to buy Bitcoin is a very bad idea. Working steady and having a regular savings plan in Bitcoin, which is within your budget, may possibly be a really good idea. Unless ...
@_date: 2019-12-29 18:33:33
The CME closed its BTC futures contract for the month last Thursday/Friday. Never can get the dates right. It's in GMT I think. Didn't seem to be too bad.
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:48:28
And forever this shall be known as the Vegeta wall. Or maybe the vegetable wall. Whichever.
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:59:58
That's what I meant. Perhaps I was unclear.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:41:10
Probably yes. There was worry the reversal would be a crash or dead cat bounce. It isn't, which is good. A triangle formation seems to be one of the only TA that pans out with BTC. The buyers want the price lower so they sell it down. The sellers want the price higher so they buy it up. The sellers run out of money and the buyers run out of Bitcoin. The volume keeps dropping while the price narrows. It becomes quiet, very quiet. Then the price wanders up or down. This will be called a breakout. It's interesting to watch.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:35:53
We'll, that was exciting.
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:01:45
Second rule of Bitcoin: Don't short Bitcoin. I was very tempted there for a while too, but I managed to get over it.
@_date: 2019-12-01 21:09:34
It's a concept that's a little subtle. Price does not necessarily represent demand. The US dollar price, against the commodities it buys, may be dropping like a stone. But it is still very much in demand. Foreign exchange markets have all sorts of hidden agendas. The CME has put in an enormous effort to "tame" Bitcoin. I don't know if the CME wants BTC or not, but they are sure the hell interested in it. So are many others who wish they were the Bitcoin 1%. Price can often be a very good indicator of demand. Sometimes it's not. It's not a fair market where usual indicators can be reliable.
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:56:17
Actually it shows that driving the price downwards doesn't shake any Bitcoins loose. There may be a great deal of demand. But ordinary people are holding a huge percentage etc.
@_date: 2019-12-11 01:39:21
This is probably the best advice. You should have either your significant other, if you have one, know what you are doing and have a proper will anyway. If you have a will and offline storage in a safety deposit box, leave the key with a lawyer or your estate manager. This question gets asked a lot. Bitcoin causes people to plan regular savings, figure out a trusting relationship with your lady (if you have kids together, your life savings are a mutual thing) and plan for an unexpected demise. So Bitcoin is good for you and this is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-09 13:42:23

Volume is extremely low and may get less. We appear to be at the point of a large triangle. Not a market to be in right now. The tension mounts...
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:26:40
Now between 8900 and 9k. Very thin market. Down to a hundred bucks.
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:04:32
Agreed. QE makes it real interesting. It should eventually hurt the dollar. BTC is a good candidate for a global reserve currency as an alternative and may well save the dollar in the end.

@_date: 2018-11-15 04:23:28
Stocks of companies that generally export. More exports cause the dollar to rise. But yes, that makes exports more expensive to a foreign buyer. You are correct. However you don't set the value of the dollar first then export. As you sell your product overseas you are setting the value of the dollar. That increases the dollar price against the foreign currency. The market sets the dollar, the dollar does not set the market. 
Sometimes speculators play in the currency market but that is dwarfed by the overall volume of goods and services traded internationally.
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:28:33
Still very thin and holding within an ever shrinking band. Meh. Monday or Tuesday we all get to find out. Unless we don't.

This could go on for months yet.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:17:21
I think you are correct. Bonds deal with interest rates. Low bonds usually correspond to rising stocks. The US dollar floats on exports vs imports. If exporting stocks fall, the dollar falls. Bitcoin, on the other hand, don't give a shit. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:57:33
No argument here. However you can wait 6 months for payment or 10 minutes. There are already significant international payments being made in Bitcoin. Not many, but some. The market cap needs to be about 10 times bigger. Not that volatile lately. Not over 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:08:02
Well, totally wrong about the DOW and BTC seems to be doing ok. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:43:16
It's the DOW. Crunch time. If it turns, which is a very good possibility, it'll turn sharply. Or, it could do anything else. IMHO.
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:44:31
Not if people start using it for international trade settlements. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:30:08
Slight downward signals. The trade war is an outlier and may be interpreted as FUD. Then again, maybe it'll be a sunny day in NY. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:11:30
Crash is a relative term. So is panic. Particularly on this sub. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:57:36
And someone just bought 120. It's getting more fluid. Whatever that means. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:23:45
Holy shit that is so cool. Time to hide under my desk. I expect volume to drop close to zero. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:22:12
The market is having a discussion over the accepted price of Bitcoin. Ever-thinning price between buying and selling with low volume. Zoom out to the one year chart and it becomes easier to understand. Usually it means a very large transaction is about to take place. Maybe some time this year. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:22:05
It's the day after a possible bloodbath on the DOW. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:35:22
People will sell when the price is high enough. At the present time, the market cap is too low for BTC to take the role of a global reserve. When the market cap is high enough, then a few million ordinary people, rather than 6 or 7 very privileged, will hold and control the global reserve. This global reserve will dissipate or concentrate according to market forces.
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:17:37
Gee, it's a lot more fun watching the numbers get bigger than watching them get smaller.

Welp I guess we all found out what a breakout looks like. Still remarkably early and it might well mean nothing in the long run, but it doesn't look like it's still in a wedge.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:49:52
Still too early to tell. Looks like a breakout continuing to form and gaining ground very, very slowly.
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:43:49
Pull back and look at the one year chart. Massive wedge/triangle with extremely low volume. Just a friendly discussion between buyers and sellers as to the agreed upon price of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:44:23
Yup. Nobody even blink. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:48:46
I think the DOW is going to tank tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:07:08
If I'm right, we'll see the effect on BTC. Last time, it dragged bitcoin down with it. Sometimes they diverge. It's an interesting correlation. If it exists. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:17:50
Well, it appears this Sunday bloody Sunday pretty well proves Bitcoin has established a sleeping cat trendline.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:43:08
It can break up or down. The definite signals are at about 20k and 6k. Above 20k and it has broken up. Below 6k and it has broken down. Place your bets.
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:54:46
It's about 8920 with a 5 dollar margin over US exchanges. It ain't moved yet. Sit back down.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:15:34
This is starting to look like a sleeping cat pattern.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:32:25
I have been buying at the ATH for about 6 months now. Every time I buy the price drops. So far I have no complaints.
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:03:42
You got it. Very low volume and a hell of a battle between 9k and 8.5k I think those two values mark a week signal for a direction. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:01:51
That s why the volume is so low. Any major move gets countered immediately. If GS is going to put in their trillion dollars, now would be a good time. Cause it ain't gonna move from here.
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:10:25
Well, it looks like we're in another sleeping cat pattern.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:40:14
Even though there is supposed to be no correlation between stocks and the price of Bitcoin, the NYSE open on Monday may possibly be interesting. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:54:07
Trade war
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:11:26
A little early to call it a breakout, but we're getting close. Looking at the one year chart. Seems to look like a large triangle. Very thin market for Bitcoin. Next few days (hours?) could be kinda interesting.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:58:29
Bonds are off a bit too. These are all fairly small fluctuations. It may be that Bitcoin is used as a hedge and if market turns that hedge would be cashed out to cover stop losses. That won't last long. This is a small dip for now. Everything is fine. Just fine.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:40:40
It's backed by human labour. Think about it please. I don't see sustainable value in what it buys; I see sustainable value in how hard I had to work to get the stuff. The global Hodl holds its value from people refusing to degrade their accumulated hours of work in order to buy it in the first place. A Bitcoin is worth a Bitcoin. It is the dollar that is falling.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:01:19
Once. It's Friday.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:58:24
There is a definite pattern there. Since there is cash settlement, it puts a huge onus on getting the price down to the previous month's settlement date. It makes manipulation profitable. The CME so-called futures is heavily favoured towards driving down the spot. It is not a fair market.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:52:13
Aaannnnndddd the DOW is still falling. Perhaps this may be significant? A few days ago BTC and the DOW appeared to be linked in some strange way. Now they're diverging. Hmmmm.
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:25:45
I have been consistently buying Bitcoin at the ATH for the past six months. Every time I buy the price drops. So far, I have no complaints.
Seriously, an investment strategy is not a one-time shot and hope for the best. What has changed lives is that you can have a regular saving plan over the years and your savings maintain value. In this way, Bitcoin is more of a reserve than an investment or currency. Remember to diversify over the years. Don't touch your capital and the best things I life are free.
An investment into Bitcoin is a gutsy and excellent start. Welcome to the ride sister.
@_date: 2019-09-29 00:34:49
CME Bitcoin futures are on monthly contracts. Here is the link:
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:15:11
A slight rise across the boards.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:13:57
It's been happening for some time. This time it became pretty obvious. The SEC is responsible. The market has to figure out how to level the playing field.
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:23:39
That drop may have backfired. Should have been a reverse Bart. Time for more popcorn.
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:04:56
There seems to be a slight increase in FUD.
@_date: 2018-07-23 16:18:52
It's starting to look not bad. Still early, but not bad.

@_date: 2019-09-03 15:12:08
Perhaps OP ran out of popcorn.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:37:24
CME futures settles on the 27th.
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:40:03
That's absolutely correct. Also, that's how a futures contract with physical delivery "works". People have to scramble on the spot to cover exposure on the futures. This latest looks like a little demo.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:55:49
This seems to be slightly unusual behavior for a commodity coming out of a triangle formation.
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:32:46
Well, still going sideways.
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:58:07
The spot drives the margins. Not the other way around.
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:40:00
So the CME futures contract expires and it's all quiet again. Let's see what happens next month.
@_date: 2018-07-09 17:26:12
I'm waiting for the volume to hit zero.
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:23:12
Didn't have much trouble with$10k. Looks like it may turn around at about $11.9. That is, if it is still in this rather large triangle. However, it is Bitcoin we're talking about. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2019-09-17 16:04:17
If the price rises against a futures contract, and there is physical delivery at the end of the contract, it's a very simple way to get your hands on a hell of a lot of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:27:36
This may go on for another month. It's Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:18:40
Volume still very low. We could be here for a while. It's also the weekend, but that might not make any difference.
@_date: 2019-09-05 23:58:11
Sideways is good.
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:44:20
It actually should be used by mining operations to set a guaranteed price in the future for when their coins are mined. That is by far the most sane way to use a futures market. It's supposed to remove the risk, not add to it.
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:33:13
Looks like the shorts are popping.
@_date: 2019-09-13 13:50:26
It may be a little while yet. It shouldn't be all that dramatic with a slowly increasing volume. If she drops down, it'll be a slow but steady drop unless there is strong manipulation. If she rises, she will need to cross 11k to have a solid signal and pass 13k to be out of the triangle. In that case Bitcoin will go on a drunken rampage. She won't be pretty and it'll be embarassing.
@_date: 2019-09-22 17:09:34
Hate to tell you guy, they updated the calendar. Happened a while ago. Stay well.
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:02:40
This bitch blows 9k and you better hold onto your butt, cause if you dont, it'll get left behind. (behind ... get it?)
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:15:54
Once you get started with a decent exchange, you can continue to invest over time with what you can afford to put away. It builds up very quickly.
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:15:00
Still very low volume, but interesting.
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:38:51
Oh yes they would. And do.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:46:19
Put in $5 worth. It drives the bots crazy.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:07:17
It appears that with slightly more volume, this may indicate a possible breakout. However it is still a moderate movement. Nevertheless the buyers and sellers may possibly have agreed on a price. There could be an increase in the number of trades today.
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:56:10
On a strictly technical level we still have not broken out of a massive wedge. However things appear a bit promising that we are headed in the direction of a breakout. It seems this idea of a fractal pattern has some merit. I have no idea why that would be so.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:10:25
Still in the wedge. Thought it would have broken out by now. We may be here for some time.
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:34:38
Bitcoin climbing through a series of triangles while volume increases.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:21:32
I'd call 9K as a decent signal. Remember, it's bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:56:41
Bitcoin never sleeps.
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:00:05
Usually it drifts up or down with a steady increase in volume back to normal levels. This was a hard break with a single injection of $1B worth of commodity into the market.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:56:42
Watch the volume guys. And yes, it's a battle.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:47:38
The financial institutions/governments will just print more money. This is an important question and o e that needs to be discussed and thought about. Banks would have to adjust and provide financial services to the public or be run  out of existence. Bitcoin is the only financial instrument in the world that can soak up all that toxic debt.
It would be a major global financial crisis which would be "saved" by the blockchain/bitcoin in some way. We would have to be creative. I believe we would go along some path of using smart contracts/Ethereum instead of credit and new financial institutions/communities would arise to fulfill the needs of providing financial.services.
Presently, most of the global reserve is generate through accrual. While an oil tanker/company, for example, is waiting 6 months to get paid from one currency to another,  bets are made with that money on foreign currency by buying and selling money. If the market turns against the bets made then that has to be "corrected". Usually through attacking an unexpected  rising currency by harming that country or through warfare I  some way.
With Bitcoin, the accrual would be eliminated.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:41:30
Let's see what it's like at noon. Still early to call a breakout, but if that is what we are seeing, this will be a hell of a day on the floor.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:29:58
It's still in the wedge and has yet to break.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:34:13
Volume starting to increase a little. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:27:49
Aaaannnnddd once again the volume is dropping as the price range narrows. We're in another triangle and will break out either up or down. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:12:05
We may possibly be seeing a little bit of a breakout happening. Maybe.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:26:45
Seems like action on the DOW dies down and so does the action in BTC. Maybe the NYSE is finding out that Bitcoin is your friend and not your enemy.

We got a Bart next to a reverse Bart and now we could have another Bart. Looking like the ominous square wave formation. Exciting.
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:01:36
What was supposed to be boring again?
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:23:50

@_date: 2017-07-07 21:50:29
Sussed it. Not enough karma.
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:05:19
There's a battle going in. It's the assault on the 9k wall! Get ready to power up.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:07:08
Honey badger time.
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:56:23
$8k was a previous peak. Previous peak to that was about $9.3k. I have absolutely no idea if that means anything.
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:19:51
Ah, assumptions go sideways. Got it.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:10:33
Agreed.

There are consequences to everything you do. Rule 2 concerns selling to buy back later at a lower price. Rule 3 concerns buying to sell later at a higher price. Both rules involve timing the market. Good luck with that when it comes to Bitcoin. Rule 1 is obvious.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:37:44
Finally, a Bitcoin chart that looks like a Bitcoin chart. Good ol' parabolic growth.
Three rules of Bitcoin to consider:
1. Don't store Bitcoin on an exchange.
2. Don't short Bitcoin.
3. Never borrow money to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:24:14
They might have beer at the bear market.
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:22:30
Noticed that too. Volume increased during recent drop. Now volume back up on this rise. No idea why. I hope that helps.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:46:11
Looks like the line is drawn. After this little tussle, the next level is $9k. Beware the onslaught of memes when that happens.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:52:27
Welcome back Bitcoin. It's been a while.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:14:14
Aha! So whenever you want to puke on your shoes, buy Bitcoin. Got it.
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:28:09
Bear trap?
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:56:42
It might go sideways for a while.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:08:16
Well, yesterday was exciting. Gotta get me some more popcorn.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:26:56
Morning. I take it you guys are going to steal away all of Japan's Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:09:00
The link takes me to download app. Account now set up. Where's the chat room?
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:01:21
Yeah. It was fun while it lasted.
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:41:27
The one month chart between BTC and the DOW is a very interesting comparison. This could possibly be an indication of institutional or professional investors getting involved. If so, then a use-case of BTC as store of value during downturns has been discovered by some pretty heavy hitters. However, please remember, we're talking about Bitcoin here. No knows what's happening.
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:01:56
Animal memes only from here on in.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:57:14
Yuh. I'm new at this. Should repost.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:41:49
Japan is waking up.
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:57:12
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:35:11
Good. You can take the next shift. ��
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:22:27
Test. Trying to figure out how to post on this damn android app. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:12:54
It's very exciting to watch. Let's see which side runs out of ammunition first.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:44:43
It's a place where you can go to buy bears.
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:24:07
Um ... silly question while eating popcorn here: when's the CME open for BTC today?
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:18:03
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:16:14
Some of us have seen this market behavior before. The fun is now to watch bizarre TA, business news analysis and expert opinions while eating popcorn.
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:28:10
If it goes low enough, people will buy. If it goes high enough, people will sell 
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:16:29
I think they're trying to buy and sell to each other's same side. But the transaction gets intercepted and the volume gets smaller. It's a very classic battle.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:34:07
I think of it more as a reserve than an investment. Kind of like having a pallet fully stacked with gold bars in your back yard.
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:01:45
Kinda looks like a Bart. What's the TA on that?
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:55:48
If it hits 6k it's gone. Unless ...
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:02:43
Everybody duck!!!!
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:32:28
I have to wait for 9 min? Why?
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:05:18
Be fast with that vageta meme. It won't last long.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:10:12
It's a fricken Bart!
