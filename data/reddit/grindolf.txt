That was great thanks, this is still all very intimidation. Now I have to choose a wallet and figure out what a segwit is

It's like 0.2 ? I think, and this is based on CAD to BTC because I'm in Canada not the US. It confuses me when everyone here is like we are at 16k and I'm like it says 21K though... Then I realize that's USD to BTC. But yeah he has cruciate ligament disease but he's slim and only 5 years old so I don't know why he has it so early he is a Cavapoo and normally looks like a golden sheep lol. 
My math might be off but based on current Canadian conversion that's what I came up with.

Seeing his sad face when he couldn't jump up on the sofa tore my heart out but at least I had this investment to use for him, I just feel guilty for considering not taking it out

I literally just got into Bitcoin yesterday I can see why people are becoming obsessed with it. Still figuring out a lot of stuff but this sub has been amazingly helpful

Oooh awesome that is convenient, where can you buy those? Like official ones
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:32:00
Well I can't afford much I'm not going to make millions lol, but that's dangerous thinking that you lost out. As long as get more out than goess in its a win

In the UK we have a chocolate bar called a Yorkie, and in the advertising they banned it for girls as only men can eat it. Of course their sales improved because girls started buying them saying, "This will show them"
