I also believe it is, a lot less people follow crypto than in January, and that’s because they ain’t fomo’ing yet, because they’re ‘bearish’

Sorry to hear that..I’ve tried using bitpay before, too many restrictions and ultimately it’s not user friendly at all.
 -&gt; any wallet in the world works, with buyer protection. If you use their own, transactions are instant.
If the pizzeria connects to their API they can start instantly accepting from 5 Currencies at least (btc eth utk dgb etc) and more will be added.
They’re going live in May, but here’s a video of a beta tester doing a payment, and this is exactly the experience we need imo -

Got lost, disclaimer I hold UTK and I follow utrust. 
Can you explain the custodial payment processor part/not being ideal because of it?
On my eyes they are like a regular payment enabler, just like PayPal, who hold funds in escrow with lower rated merchants in order to provide the protection for buyers. Merchant can accept fiat or any crypto (they have integrated) as payment. Seems ideal to me!
