what does that have to do with tax?

I have updated to clarify what i was petitioning. My petition is to not tax crypto to crypto trading. Since it hasnt been converted to USD, it should not be taxed. Similar to "like-kind" exchange.

But its not issued by our government why should they be able to tax something that they dont issue or regulate?

EDIT- Crypto to Crypto trading should not be taxed. You have not converted to fiat currency therefore have not realized gains or losses and have not converted to USD which makes it non-regulatable. I have updated the petition.

crypto to crypto trading shouldnt be taxed, converting to fiat i agree should be taxed but not converting.

So then why is "like-kind" exchnage allowed for property? but not crypto? double standard

"Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank." 
-Doesn't this pretty much indicate that a tax on it would be inappropriate?

because its not governed and its decentralized, the whole point of it.

Jack Ma is brutally honest and i have to agree in that a lot of people pretend to understand Bitcoin when they dont. That being said i think Bitcoin is the future of mobile payments.
