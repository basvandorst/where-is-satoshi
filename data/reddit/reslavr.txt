Based on statistics, I warn you - for those who decide to make money on Bitcoin trading - 80% of people do not fit in day trading (intraday trading) because they merge their entire deposit because of the factors that I indicated in the book, for example, such as greed, intemperance, naivety, non-punctuality,
inability to clearly and pre-define and set stops and take-profits (limit closing orders) in accordance with risk management. Believe me, no matter how frightening it sounds, and paradoxically, the truth is that human nature usually prevails and people simply cease to control themselves. In this case, it is recommended to trade on monthly or annual timeframes without applying the leverage of the exchange. Do not forget to transfer funds to a special medium to keep your cryptocurrency safe and sound.

Having plenty of bargaining and having received some additional income, some traders who become interested in the fundamental principles of earning money on the exchange **come to the choice of long-term investment** and try to be guided by the postulate of one of the leaders of the stock market, **Woren Buffett, “the principle of investing in undervalued projects"**. Invest in shares of foreign companies, already formed giants, such as Apple, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Intel, Amd, Nvidia, Alibaba, Uber, Airnb, Naspers, or invest in the **development of their software and create your own organizational structure**, your a team of like-minded people and **create a useful product in demand in the international community**. The greatest prospects for making money when developing an **individual product are to fill an unrealized niche of demanded services.**
Having analyzed hundreds of investment projects, I came to the conclusion that for me personally, as for most investors, the most relevant developments in the field of mobile software and artificial intelligence are the most relevant, because such projects have the prospect of generating more profit (i.e., they are the most investment attractive).
Because Since 2003, I have been working in the field of developing Internet announcement services (free classified ads). A product created on the basis of **Osclass open source software with the Android application** has become the prototype for the implementation of the project in the field of growing blockchain developments, offline Internet wallets that do not require the presence of banks and intermediaries. **Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies served as an example for creating your own token (cryptocurrency), which provides a guarantee of calculating the cost of a product using third-party analytics services**, such as Google Analytics, which track leads (sales) of site services. Thus, it became possible to create your own site (product) index and bring it to the virtual Internet cryptocurrency exchange with a cost regulated by automated calculation of the sales volume of the service. This model has become so attractive that in a project that begins its implementation anywhere in the world, any investors have the opportunity to invest funds regardless of status and location using Bitcoin, Ezereum and other cryptocurrencies. Such projects of financial instruments managed to raise several billion dollars in a matter of months, for example: EOS ($ 2.6 billion), Tezos ($ 1.2 billion), etc. That is. projects raised more money than would be necessary only on the faith of **investors and the massive adoption (degree of scalability) of cryptocurrencies**.
I came to the conclusion that our **product is universal because it meets such factors as: scalability, multilingualism, cross-platform, openness, security, design, etc.** After all, the site has been translated into dozens of languages, uses open source code, is safe. The project provides **modules and plugins that can be developed by anyone who knows the PHP programming language (analogous to C ++)** and creates various useful services needed in his country or region and sells / transfers these plugins to all project partners thus making the company stronger, and accordingly all its members are richer. Think about where else such projects are offered on the market, who can give you the opportunity to earn from $1 - 18,000 (similar to Amazon) in a matter of years (say 3-10 years) by further withdrawing to any **decentralized cryptocurrency exchange**? According to my observations, no one. Although everything has a place to be - perhaps you will show some better than projects and **can offer more optimal investment conditions**.

now you buy bitcoin for 8000 tomorrow its price will be 2000 .. and so it will last 3 years. Do you have this time to wait for the next crypto winter? No one is safe from her, and so are you! For those people who need to earn $ 500 out of $ 100 on day trading urgently, and understanding the system and the whole scheme is very easy to do this by accepting a number of rules for yourself. The ability to work with oneself — to overcome one’s fears and weaknesses — will not be able to drain a deposit — nothing complicated, but you cannot do it because you are a failure. Go your way. You have nothing more to add

Who the hell are you to make such judgments?

Dear, you are right in yours. But to each his own. I do not agitate and do not force people to do day trading, I just describe my experience in day trading and show how to act if a person has already decided to engage in day trading. 500% profitability in 7 days is true. The question is - are you ready for this? Are you ready to speed up the freem. It’s not just that futures were invented - someone succeeds or do you want to challenge this statement? 
I wrote this book because I needed to speak. I showed my experience, my feelings, wrote my history of trading bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges

There are many poor people in the world for whom $ 500 is a reward and you won’t give it to them with a long-term investment in bitcoin, there is no guarantee that he will make x3-x5, like any other coin or cryptocurrency. If you have any problems with the tax - specify what you meant, you want to say that someone will show someone that he did not pay taxes? You are ridiculous and lying yourself considering your smart articles on reddit about the benefits of bitcoin. There are a lot of anonymous cryptocurrencies and when withdrawing funds through them, not a single tax one will force you to report. Lekgo like that to make an attack - they say you are a liar and a rogue, but in reality - show a person who is ready to control his emotions and acquire a wealth of day trading in a stern and punctual way? Have you failed at yourself? Are you a loser Once again, everyone goes their own way. So go.
