I started back in 2013. But like any good cold storage... I rarely used it. Then it's own technology updates kinda broke my ability to use it like I once had. Lack of support made it hard to decide if attempting to upgrade the offline wallet was a good idea or not. 
Glad I didn't. 
@_date: 2016-04-30 14:07:36
I'd love to see your reasons- this number would be great! 
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:07:54
Since I still had the old offline wallet available- I did an export of those addresses/keys. This balance was even less than the 10 shown above.  Then I ticked the checkbox for "show unused" addresses-- and there it was. The remaining bitcoins I've been looking for. Somehow- when I did the import from the offline to online (and newer version) armory a while back, I think some of those addresses didn't come over correctly. I am now able to see the exact balance I expected to see, and can sweet the addresses.

Oh, I have a few. I will get something for college... I'm just making it clear that I won't do that, and never invest again. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 11:19:11
Why import to one wallet and then sweep to another? Direct sweep isn't safe? 
@_date: 2016-04-22 13:46:16
Excellent- I will post there as well. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2016-04-22 16:03:10
Yeah... it did a full sync before we sent the 3btc to the cryptolocker guys. The transaction didn't look like it went through via blockchain at the time, but another site showed it was ok-- plus we got the unlocker... so all was good.
Edit- pressed enter too soon
I'd love to find out that we got it unlocked, and my transaction of 3BTC never went through at all!
But I don't expect that. I know we only sent 3- so I'm confused what happened to the other 3.
More Edit- because: research
Armory says the transaction ID is b76dafd2055f8096160eea70fe666a926126d9db3952285e8b8d25e6e97334c7
This is not found anywhere.  However the receiving address only ever received 3BTC, and that was on transaction 00233ab77a6df4e5b1adc60265eda55b8b9b97e4e2b206c8fd98658da27aba22. Which I can confirm is correct date/time and address I sent from.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:11:52
Also, if I sell 1 BTC to buy 1 physical BTC, how do I do this in a way that doesn't get me taxed for 16k, 17k, 19k, whatevertheFk we're at when you read this of income?

Like many... I've casually followed bitcoin while maintaining some HODL. But then run into new issues I've not seen before when I'm the most qualified in the room to talk about bitcoin...
So, using blockchain.info, coinbase, or some other wallet you recommend... How would you get a newbie about $20 worth, and what should my fees be? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:19:21
But nowhere near the same amount expected. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:50
Where can I see how many unconfirmed, and does this mean I'd have to wait that long if I wanted to transfer from cold storage to coinbase to sell? Or just plan on paying higher transaction fee if I want speed on my side? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:48:53
Guess not. Not sure what that means. Just have always used blockchain / coinbase suggested fees
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:50:35

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:39:39

That is AWESOME. Why have I never heard of this until today?
@_date: 2014-10-20 12:34:25
People always say don't invest what you can't afford to lose.


Yes. You need to stop. 
Sometimes I point out that at the price BTC was when I bought my first one, I could have cashed out my 401k, purchased as many bitcoins as possible, and then would be a retired man today at only 32. But I didn't do this. And I never would have. That is/was simply TOO risky. I see speculation that bitcoins will one day be worth 100,000 each, or 1,000,000 each! I hope so! And if that's the case, cashing out my 401k now, would again yield great wealth and early retirement. But I'm not.
Stop and save. Set a low weekly limit of what you'll invest. Try to get some of your $ back- by stimulating the bitcoin economy a bit. Do you need a new computer? Go pay with bitcoin at newegg. Get some nice alpaca socks. And a few Gyft cards for everyone for the holidays. Don't buy anything you didn't already need, and wasn't part of your budget- but focus your enthusiasm of bitcoin into finding ways to spend it the way you WOULD have spent the cash if you weren't buying bitcoin.
Get your holdings back to a level that won't cause you extreme stress or depression if you log onto reddit one morning, and read- "Bitcoin hits $0. Will never return. Super hackable" -- or something crazy like that.
TL:DR - You'll be fine- put a plan in place to get to a "healthy" amount of what you can afford to lose.

I've messed with dropbox as far as having it "mounted" on my system... do you use any backup software to automate nightly backups to the dropbox folder? Or do they have some backup options?
@_date: 2014-07-23 16:09:37
Any recomendations for home backup solutions? I've done selective backups to external HDDs, and use Google Docs for everything "important" -- but my fear is that with something like this- it would just encrypt my local file, that then syncs with Google... 
Carbonite? Another company that does backups? Anything good with a "family" plan or something similar that you guys like?
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:56:00

No no no, it's not like that.
I was trying to be very clear in my post. I want to put, say, .1 BTC for each of them, and never touch it again. Then continue with my normal college savings plans, and see what happens. If I'm lucky, I'll be like the guy in that commercial that bought a boat when his child got a full ride scholarship.  -- I hope the bitcoins I give them will pay for college, and I can go sailing on the SS-Satoshi.

When I start to do an import, it says, "Warning, imported keys are not recoverable from seed."
Does this mean if I have to recover from the seed later, the bitcoins are essentially gone?  Or is that what sweeping takes care of?  Sorry- have not had to do this before.

@_date: 2015-08-04 20:21:10
Sweep, yes. 
I did a full export of my private keys last night, and when checked in bc.i, their totals (from 24 keys) added up to about 30% of what I remembered my balance being. 
So I waited. After hours and hours, the sync completed, and balance showed as expected... But can't transfer due to version problem. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:08:46
I want to transfer out of armory. I've got the private keys, but those balances are only about 30% of what's in the wallet. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 20:34:08
Maybe I need a better idea of what sweeping the private keys means, or how that would go down. Feels like I'm on the verge of understanding... so my Armory has a "Paper Backup for Armory Wallet" -- with a giant QR code, and then a Root Key and Chain Code. Both of which are the same length, 72 characters.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:41:08
That's what I was attempting- but my concern is when I look on the blockchain at the balances of all my exported addresses, it's only about 1/3 of my REAL balance.  How do I back EVERYTHING up? From another thread- it could be change-addresses. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 11:41:04
I was able to export a keylist, this contains the public address, PrivBase58, and PrivHexBE keys. When I paste either of these keys into the Electrum Sweep Private Keys box, the "Sweep" button does not enable itself.  Is it looking for something else?
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:31:01
If it doesn't go through, then it comes back to my wallet, correct? But if the transaction came FROM bc.i-- There really isn't a way to move it to another service, except through a bc.i transaction...
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:04:51
Paid and have downloaded the decrypter. Fingers crossed.
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:56:31
Will do. Yeah, when the Inline armory was updated, my balance was correct... But it said I couldn't sign transactions with an older offline version of the software. Now that I've gone back to that exempt version, I can't keep the software up long enough to sync... And no transactions until it syncs. (Metallica song?)

Sounds like a plan. I'll work this some tomorrow in my free time, and post back if I hit more problems. (in the meantime, I reinstalled the same OLD version back to my online computer- and it won't stay up long enough to sync... runtime errors and what not- KILLING ME)
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:03:46
Good info- so if I was unable to get Armory working again, or something weird happened... but still had my offline wallet- (or the recovery keys from Armory) would I be able to get the rest of my bitcoins back some other way?
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:14:00
So all three (blockchain.info, and the two you referenced) all show my transaction as unconfirmed... do I just wait this out a little longer? And what's with the blockchain.info message on the front page of now? I'm going to go read it- but sounds like people aren't too pleased...?
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:22:05
Well, if that's the case- get ready for a ride to the moon. People love a good scam- 
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:10:04
Because I'm waiting for it to sync... And then when it did sync, it was too new a version to let my offline wallet sign the transaction. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:39:57
So of the 26 address that my offline wallet produced for me when I did an Armory export- about 8 or so had a balance. Sweep everything to Electrum? And hope the balance afterwards is what I think it should be? If not- does sweeping screw up anything when I try to sync up Armory again later on to recover the rest- wherever they are hiding?
Edit: Sorry for all the questions and confusion. I REALLY appreciate the help. I'm being very cautious here... don't want to lose a single satosh. I felt like I understood and tested the whole Armory cold storage thing with very small amounts before I made the jump over a year ago- but I don't use it much (THAT'S WHY IT'S COLD STORAGE!) and the sync times plus incompatible versions are killing me. Looking forward to getting it all to the electrum offline wallet.

I am pretty convinced that EVERYONE has a price. Using today's market standards, what is that price. I mean, serriously- if they went to 1,000,000 (and it's now- not in 50 years where you can argue that a tank of gas will cost 1,000,000) you wouldn't sell some or all of them?

I made some slight adjustments, and had to resubmit. This is what I want to give to some friends and family for Christmas this year. None of them know much or anything about Bitcoin. I will print these on card-stock, then tape a single BTC Casascius coin over the QR code (which leads to the Bitcoin video)
Thoughts? How can I describe it better, while keeping it simple?
@_date: 2012-12-27 12:59:44
You could leave space for a QR Code, and print stickers on your home pc. Peel and stick. This also helps if you come up with another design, and don't want to chase down all of your unused codes. Just sticker up what your walking out the door with. 
@_date: 2012-12-11 16:00:33
I have been working on this same idea for a few weeks! My Casascius coins just came in, so I wrote this up: 
And plan on giving out a few this year.  You get a discount on coins if you buy 10 or more (or 100 or more!) - so if you don't need that many, find someone who can split a set with you!

@_date: 2012-12-11 16:03:46
How do I do that? Is that under Import/Export &gt; Paper Wallet? When I click that, it creates two, each with a single BTC in it. (I only have 2BTC in my blockchain wallet right now) -- can you get more than 1BTC? How do you then spend that wallet later? Just re-import the money? 
@_date: 2012-12-11 19:24:31
Those optional fees are SUPER low. It's considered "generous" to pay .001 as a fee. This is less than 2 cents.
@_date: 2012-12-11 16:10:24
"The difficulty is the measure of how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be. It is recalculated every 2016 blocks to a value such that the previous 2016 blocks would have been generated in exactly two weeks had everyone been mining at this difficulty. This will yield, on average, one block every ten minutes. As more miners join, the rate of block creation will go up. As the rate of block generation goes up, the difficulty rises to compensate which will push the rate of block creation back down. Any blocks released by malicious miners that do not meet the required difficulty target will simply be rejected by everyone on the network and thus will be worthless."

I will say this- I did a lot of bitcoin research myself, and ended up getting my first coins from a localbitcoins.com meet. We talked for about an hour or more about bitcoins, and this really helped me. He also suggested I come to Reddit for more news/talk/etc. And I've loved this community. In my experience of trying to learn anything new on the internet through a community- this place is an anomaly. Everyone here is so helpful. You answer the same "n00b" questions every single day. You don't put people down for what has become a simple answer and solution to their questions. It's truly refreshing.
TL:DL- he probably went along because the internet is normally hostile. If he had found this subreddit first, he would have been ok.

Just to play around- I tried using my CPU on my laptop to mine BTC (I knew it wouldn't accomplish anything, but wanted to see a little bit about how mining worked) and it was going to be 43 years before I solved my first block.

Want to be 100% anon? Create a new gmail account, and make your address the output of a password generator. s0IXi4JVsp9Y Only create and access this account through Tor. Only access any wallets through Tor. When shopping with your BTC, only through TOR. If you have a "personal" wallet that you use for things you aren't worried about anonymity with- NEVER send coins between these two accounts. If you need to get money from one to the other, cash out your personal account, then meet someone on Localbitcoins.com and buy bitcoins to be sent to your anon account.

Ooo! Do you use Google Authenticator? I couldn't log in at ALL today, and figured it could be the fact that I now use Authenticator? This adds an extra field to fill out when you log in- perhaps the plugin does not account for that?

I guess I didn't realize the wallets stored BTC as whole amounts sometimes. I thought everything could be divided down to exactly what you needed- so instead of having a 20- you have two rolls of quarters, and peel off what you need.
@_date: 2012-12-12 15:03:17
Could someone --- with enough time, always track down who paid for something. Example- someone tips me here (we'll call it wallet ABC), and I move that to my blockchain wallet (we'll say it's key is 123) and then later in the day, or later in the week, I move everything in my blockchain wallet to my desktop client (it's key is 987). So if you know that TheMann00 has wallet ABC, sent .01 to 123, and then later 123 sent 1.01 to 987 -- you're starting to get a story there. Especially if it's repeatable. Sure, 987 could be a friend, or merchant, but if it's a daily or weekly transaction, you can deduce certain things. Now- I've noticed that blockchain DOES allow me to create new wallets. So if I do that (new wallet called XYZ) -- can I then send the 1.01 to 987 from XYZ? Will there by anything to tie 123 to XYZ? Also- I could create a new wallet on my desktop client to RECEIVE. But it sounds like it's getting more and more complicated, and has potential for me to screw something up, and lose some BTC.
@_date: 2012-12-06 19:22:02
Better  yet, don't "punish" someone for using cash- reward them for using bitcoin. Artificially raise your price up front, then offer a substantial reduction in price if they pay in BTC. Have a few links and articles ready to explain bitcoin to a newcomer, and make sure your price, plus the fees someone new might incur won't keep them from taking that route. Then you introduce someone new to BTC, and sell your board at the same time!

You should get an email from the tipbot now, telling you how to add or withdrawal coins to any address you want. Or you can just hold on, and send it to someone else later.

@_date: 2012-12-11 20:26:30
Great idea FjolnirBit! I'm fairly new myself, but looking forward to what you find. As for wallets- I like using Blockchain.info as my "walking wallet" -- it's a web interface, and a good android client. I call it walking money- because I treat it like cash in my wallet. It might disappear. I would never travel around with thousands and thousands of dollars in my pocket- and I never load my Blockchain.info wallet up with too much, incase they go under suddenly one day, someone manages to hack them etc. All that said, I use them because I trust them, and many people on here do also. 
Keep up the good work!

I am looking, because I recently sent money from one wallet to another, and while that transaction does show up, it also shows me sending myself (meaning the same address as the sender) an additional .6 BTC. Which * completely* threw me.
@_date: 2012-12-19 01:06:15
Booo- didn't realize that. Had an account on there for a while- but hardly used. In the wake of recent closures, I was on there, and stumbled upon the BTC option.
@_date: 2012-12-11 21:36:12
Look at coinbase. It will take a few days though. If you need to send someone money they can hold tomorrow- wire transfers are still best- which is why they get to charge so much.
@_date: 2012-12-11 16:21:14
Yes, meeting face to face in a public place is best. Make sure he includes a fee to make the transaction go through faster! First time I did face to face, we forgot, and had to wait about an hour for verification. Then you could move everything to MtGox or another exchange, and sell it. Or post an add on LocalBitcoins.com, see if you can find someone who wants to buy coins face-to-face.
@_date: 2012-12-11 16:36:35
Sure- and an online merchant has it easy. Pack the box, by the time you're ready to ship, verification should have taken place. Services could ask for partial or full payment up front. Example: I offer to pay my barber in BTC before he cuts my hair, if something goes wrong, I'll be asked to pay cash before I leave. But could it ever work at a grocery store? Where the customer expects to leave about 30 seconds after paying...?
@_date: 2012-12-31 17:41:45
That's a good point! Perhaps your "sell" price is so high- that if it reached that, Bitcoin would have reached full market immersion at that point. So would you then take your BTC that you got for "free" or pennies on the dollar, and buy a house? Would you "cash out" into something nice for yourself, and show how little in USD you spent to get it?

How do wallet backups work? I was trying this method- because I was thinking the backup would be automatic. That issue aside for a minute, if I deposit 1BTC to my wallet, back it up (manually or automatically), then deposit 1BTC the following day- fail to backup, and have to restore from the only backup ran the first day- how much BTC do I have? Is the backup really just proof of key, and therefore money transferred in will still be there when the blockchain catches up?
@_date: 2012-12-11 16:27:05
Verification should take about 10-15 minutes max with a small fee.

Yes. I have the QT client (because I thought that's what I had to do at first) and now run my main wallet through MultiBit, and store the wallet on a TrueCrypt volume. MultiBit is one of those "lite" clients, and doesn't take days and days to sync up.

Has anyone else done this? With success? I'm not sure how Drive monitors and changes the "cloud" version of the truecrypt volume. There is potential for loss of BTC there, I would think. If I import 100BTC, then shutdown my client, and dismount Truecrypt, is there a way to verify what is online, vs locally stored waiting to upload? To help prevent this,  I made my volume 3mb in size...

I kept putting in orders, that would have had me in around $37.10- but it was at pending, while the price climbed.  Finally got fed up- put in an order at $40- and got what I was looking for. But at exactly $40. I thought it would buy at the lowest price.... meaning- if I put in a buy order right now for 10 BTC at $500- will I spend $5000? Or just get 10 at market price?

Maybe I'm not seeing it correctly then. Here is what I see. There is a house worth 100,000. I go to a bank to get a loan to buy it. They say, sure- over the next 30 years, give us 163,000- and that house is yours. If I pay for 1 year and then stop, I still owe "160,800" -- and the bank can take a house that is worth 100,000. They can then re-sell this house to someone else willing to give them 163,000 over 30 years, or they can get the 100,000 all at once, and invest it themselves to obtain 163,000 in 30 years.

I think you'll see slow movement from any service that benefits from "auto" payments- spotify, porn, etc. They want your money every month- not just when you remember to pay it! Think about it- if you use spotify every few days for 3 or 4 months, then kinda trail off, and pay for another 3 or 4 before either getting back into it, or canceling- that's an extra $40. But if you have to pay every month, you're more likely to stop sooner. Only pay when you're going on trips. etc.

Yeah- I want to try and track some people down, but I think jumping on the potential new interest with the recent reddit gold announcement is a must. By getting as many people as possible on here involved, we will have people who have different areas they are familiar with- and be able to answer a lot of questions. It's also a good intro for itself
@_date: 2013-02-13 15:39:20
I think I'm missing something... it says minimum bet is .01
But then from the site:


As soon as your transaction is confirmed in a block, you will be refunded the difference between the price of the ticket and the amount sent. In the above example, if 0.10204050 BTC are sent, 0.00204050 BTC will be refunded, which is equivalent to the amount sent minus the cost of the ticket.
So if picking your own numbers, you can never have 00 as the first number? and you have to pay a lot extra to have 99 as the first number? Also- in their example, how do they know I want to pay .1, and not .01 for my ticket?
Sorry- if it's explained elsewhere, I missed it.
@_date: 2013-01-22 01:40:15
I'm only a few minutes in, but I'm already disagreeing. It says that the bank "conjures" up the money to loan, based on your ability to pay it back. But the bank DOES have to either have, or borrow themselves, the amount you are looking to purchase. It's all risk vs. reward. The riskier, the higher the interest rate...

answered my own Q a little bit--
order of numbers don't matter- so if you pick your own, it will use the lowest number as the charge. So picking 95,96,97,98 is a very expensive play.
It does say that choosing that ticket you get 95 plays... so I'm unclear on if that's 95 drawings using the same number, or 1 ticket of your choosing, and 94 random tickets...

I think a Ponzi scheme always has a person or a company at the top- that is cooking the books, and making payouts based on false data to clients- until they either get caught, or walk away. The open nature of bitcoin and the lack of a central authority kind of make this NOT a ponzi scheme. What you are describing (price increasing of a limited resource that rewards early adopters) sounds an awful lot like the stock market. Funny- how people trade bitcoins on a "market."

Someone point out if you think this is a bad idea but this is how I do it: I use the client MultiBit, running a wallet file stored on a TrueCrypt volume that is stored on the cloud. So far I have tested reinstalling MultiBit on a fresh install on a separate computer, opening the TrueCrypt volume and running my wallet from that new computer just fine.

I started by "playing around" - if you're new- the concept of turning any amount of fiat cash (which I understand, and it still buys bread and milk) into something that sounds interesting, and I *think* I understand... is scary. I used a couple of faucets, tweeted something for blockchain, and was off an running with a super small amount I could send between some wallets, and start to see how it worked a little better than just reading about people doing it. Then I was more willing to put real cash into it. 
BTW, you can't sell .005 BTC on MtGox- that was one of the first things I learned ;)

Well, that's kinda my point. I mean, can I mine with 1 million dollars to throw at the problem? Or is that not even enough? Is $1,000 enough to expect to break even one day? 
I'm not asking because I have my checkbook out, I'm asking because I think it's an interesting question, and wanted to understand it a bit better and describe mining to someone who is asking me- since I have not done it- I wanted to know if it is even a viable option these days if you have NOTHING in it yet.

haha- yea. Good points... but if there was a way to pay recurring in the USD equivalent... monthly payment of $99 in whatever BTC is trading for...
I agree with everything you've said, except how do you take that info to a merchant, and CONVINCE them to accept BTC. Whatever fees they are paying to the credit card companies, they probably make up in one or two people who are on auto-pay, and don't utilize the service.
TL:DR - Convince me, the (never-heard-of-bitcoin) service provider, that accepting bitcoins will help my business grow.

I was wondering about this the other day- if difficulty is always changing, then the expensive high-speed chips are just a way for people with the means to eliminate more competition. Nothing else. The "benefit" of mining faster is a short lived one, but as difficulty increases- it's harder and harder for entry level mining (even before ASICs- it was something like 43 years for me to expect my first block using my laptop CPU)
EDIT: --So spending money on ASICs gets rid of more people like me. People with GPU rigs start to feel like I do when faced with the decision to mine or not. --
I'm not saying this is a bad thing- I'm just making an observation, and checking with all of you as to if I am correct.

I've always been a fan- because of the android app. It's my "walk around money" -- show off bitcoins to friends, maybe sell a few bucks worth- 
This could be done with an android wallet app. So which is more likely- that my blockchain.info wallet will get hacked? Or that my phone will stop working one day, and the bitcoins will be lost forever on a "local" storage app? (I'm on my 3rd phone in 2 years... these things just don't get along with me)

With Reddit now accepting bitcoin, and how much this community and general support/interest has grown recently- I looked at the search results for bitcoin, and most things seemed to be between 4 months and a year old- is there someone here who could do it again, or wants to do it for the first time? Someone with a lot more knowledge than me?

I think paying in gold is about as hard as paying in bitcoin- except bitcoin has the backing and ability to break free of some of these difficulties.

Yes- that was me monitoring the difference between 3 Bitcoin exchanges, and also looking to see what Litecoin, PPC, and Namecoin. I believe that Bitcoin and Litecoin are more tied to each other (like silver and gold) but wanted to also see what happened to the other ones tracked by that app. If you have android, get it [here](

@_date: 2013-04-26 13:44:24
If anyone was affected- I'd like to know if you had the android app installed, and what other bitcoin-related apps you had installed- perhaps we can narrow down what caused this. I read about the passwords being stored in plain text, and then the heist stories, so I immediately factory restored my phone, changed my blockchain password, and have not installed anything "extra" on my phone yet. (including all of those cool bitcoin price widgets)
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:26:18
Maybe not- I keep seeing BFL delay messages- but thought I had seen posts about ASICs being out. Like I said- I have not paid a lot of attention to mining news- because it wasn't something I could ever do. Now I can. Trying to get all the mining news from the last 6 months Matrix style.

that's awesome. exists- so I came up with something else. For the record- this is NOT April Fools. This is how much BTC can be purchased with a single $1. Over the past 6 months. the reference was to invoke a grin or two. :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:26:44
~~That's no longer true.~~
"Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Monday Apr 15, 2013 at 01:24PM PDT after your funds have arrived."&gt;
So if you put in $152 right now (price of 1BTC at writing) you will NOT get 1BTC on Monday. You will get $152 worth of BTC as of Monday's price.
Edit: learning to read
@_date: 2013-07-29 20:32:45
Hehe- the naive thought that $182 was a "weekly drop!" ;)
@_date: 2013-01-22 23:45:39

Dave Ramsey talks about how you can save money by carrying cash around. When shopping, you are more likely to show restraint when you start thinking about the stack of cash in your pocket, and not about the "unlimited freedom" of a credit card. These monthly services don't want you to think about cash. They want you to set-it-and-forget-it. Accepting bitcoins would be like accepting cash from their business perspective.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:27:50
Sure- and they seem to be the only one I've seen with Altcoins too- so if that's something he wants to get into maybe, do a little hedging... 
@_date: 2013-01-30 13:30:19
Luckily, I have not made any substantial amount of money yet- but I guess this is something you would have to keep on a separate ledger? Purchases and sales on a spreadsheet or something? Is it something you have to be able to PROVE later on? (Block-chain info on the ledger perhaps?)

Ugh- I guess. I've watched a few short-lived "corrections" -- I deposited this money the day it went from $90 to $75. Hind-sight, pay the wire fees next time. Money was ready at $160, and so I thought I'd wait for the "weekly drop" -- which didn't happen this week.  I've always been ahead on BTC, but this time to buy in is really eating my lunch.

Do walls represent funded orders? I can put in a buy order for 100 at $20, even if I only have $40. This to ensure I'll buy as much as possible (because pending sell orders can change my $ onhand)... So would that add a $2000 wall, or only show what I have money for right now? 
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:37:34
I've done a few things- always meet in public place of course- but start with low amounts. Meet the person, and sell less than one BTC. If they seem trustworthy, meet again. I have one guy, we just meet at a bank parking lot, he jumps in my car, hands me cash- I deposit it at the drive through- and as long as they don't complain about the cash I've handed them- I transfer BTC over to him. Great way to make sure the money is real, it's safe because there are cameras everywhere- and I've delt with him enough times to know it's going to be ok.
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:58:07
Is the ad still up? Have someone else interested in the headphones (BUT NOT BITCOIN) and offer to meet somewhere. Make sure it's public again. Get 3 or 4 people there. When he sits down to show off the headphones to a new person, walk up with your group, say "thanks for my headphones I paid for yesterday" and walk out.

Encrypting the wallet screws things up?! I think I dodged a bullet. I've been using Multibit, with the wallet files stored on a truecrypt volume, that is on GoogleDrive. I *thought* this was working, even did some transactions on different computers- but when I was consolidating some coins a couple of weeks ago, I sent the remaining .052 BTC from this wallet to another, and it never went through. I've been wondering if they were lost coins, or already spent (and not properly updated in my client). I'll have to dig a little deeper to figure it out I guess.
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:40:50
You could use GoogleDrive, DropBox, SugarSync, any number of online file storage sites that offer small free space, and (this is the important part) some kind of interface with your PC. I know GoogleDrive and DropBox both do- I can go to My Computer, and those show up as "drives" -- changes made while offline are synced the next time I'm online, but I'm almost always online. And for 99% of BTC transactions, you'd need to be online anyways.
So you're secure from your computer login password. Secured from your cloud provider password. And then TrueCrypt. If you're not familiar, it's great. You setup a "volume" and let it store itself somewhere. Normally, on your harddrive, thumbdrive, etc. In this case, I store it to a cloud service. When you go to mount the TrueCrypt volume, you have to provide a password. Mine is VERY secure. More so than any other point in this chain. Once it's mounted, I run MultiBit Bitcoin client, and it looks to load a wallet file stored on that TrueCrypt volume.
Honestly- this is way more wordy sounding than it is difficult. Let me know if you have anymore questions- I think it's a safe and easy way to go. But perhaps not THE safest... 
...You could do an offline Armory wallet...

@_date: 2013-01-06 08:21:18
Except fear of bubble, maybe? As long as bitcoin wasn't growing because USD was straight up failing, I could see cashing out a large sum being a good idea. Certainly circumstantial though- I'll agree with that.
@_date: 2013-03-02 16:04:28

Best way to earn? Sell something on BitMit, or hawk a service you can currently do. (I'll host your website for USD or BTC) -- Offer discounts for those using bitcoin. (I offer up to 60% off on my hosting)
You'll never earn anything mining at that rate. Better off learning about bitcoin, and offering up good advice here. Then someone might tip you. Like this:

Scratch off that sticker, and then use your phone to read the QR code under it (unless it's also printed out, I've never used Printcoin)
Then go to your blockchain.info wallet. Once logged in, go to Import/Export. Where it says "Import Private Key" - type in the long string you found under that hologram.
If you don't currently have a QR Code reader, and it isn't written out under that hologram, search for GoogleGoggles or just search for QR code reader on your smart phone. Install the app, turn it on, point it at that code, and then in blockchain, type out the string it provides back to you.

I bought low and sold high a single BTC right before all the mess happened, when I saw it- I assumed it was the "normal weekly mess" - so I took the money from that high sell, and bought in at $180. Didn't buy any more (no USD), and not going to sell.

How about 9pm EST on 2/18/13? -- Upvote if you can commit to be here then- and I'll get the AMA setup. The more people we can have there, the better chance we can answer any questions given to us.

I don't think I have ever seen the 24 hour price outside of the orders like this...

It's an interesting idea- but let me tell you my reddit experience here with -- It's been perfect. I came here with just enough knowledge of bitcoin to be dangerous. I have never felt attacked, or that my questions were bad. I've always had great responses- and felt welcomed by the community. I feel like this is different from every other forum I've ever encountered on the internet. If it isn't people being dismissive, it's the FAQ that demands that you search your heart out before posting any questions at all, etc. That is not the case here. I say keep on the same path. Don't worry about only doing it on Monday. I try to jump in where I can- and the longer I'm here, the more jumping in I have been able to do. There are a lot more people, and a lot more of the same questions being repeated- but these people just want to talk and learn about bitcoins!

I think there is a HUGE incentive. There are a lot of cloud storage companies for the home user right now. Which ones accept bitcoin? If only one did- that's a small short-term monopoly. If they cash out right away, pass on a small discount to BTC payees, they will probably end up with the same amount in USD as when they use credit card transactions. But they post on this subreddit with 27k+ readers- anyone who was trying to decide which cloud provider to go with now has a clear option. The incentive is more new customers.

you're dumb. that was a joke. try thinking while reading.

Not to mention, how many early adopters in other areas lose money. It was a risk- so far it's working out for them! Congrats!
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:10:56
Right- but I've been waiting for one since $160. Debating if I should keep waiting or not...

Looks awesome- but nearest BOA is 100 miles. :(
I used to use BitMe - they had chase deposits. but they are gone now.

Hey guys, these increase in price EVERY DAY. I'm losing money talking to you and not buying all of them up right now!
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:49:07
are they all still unused??
I gave away some 1BTC xmas '12- those people love me today.

I understand having to wait for confirmations... what I don't understand- is that I had .85, sent .1 to Satoshi Dice, and then only had .05 available balance until the Satoshi dice send and receive finished out later... Why wouldn't my available just drop to .75?

"Its primary commercial use is probably to buy drugs from Silk Road, a sort of pirate eBay hidden in the “deep web”. This suggests that the new users are buying Bitcoin as an investment, not as a means of exchange. For any currency to thrive it needs users, not just speculators."
Is there any data on this? Maybe it's right- but with so many other places to use it- has anyone been able to estimate how much is being spent at Silkroad vs everywhere else?
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:04:02
I've found a few- people looking to cash out and slightly lower market prices- either willing to take risk, or unaware...
@_date: 2013-02-13 20:37:03
so... the only downfall of the system is that you are forced to buy the number of tickets equal to the lowest number in your group. The only way to buy a single ticket is to get a random one, or something with 01 as one of the numbers

Great writeup! I would suggest changing the verbage about taxes. While your bitcoin savings can never be garnished, income can always be taxed. It might be harder for someone to prove how much you made- but if you're audited, and found to be lying, you WILL be responsible. There are lots of posts on here about how you should still report income (via trades, people paying you in BTC, etc) and pay appropriate taxes. Swithcing to an all BTC life might avoid taxes for a while, but if it gets as big as we all hope, the government won't shut it down, it'll just figure out how to get it's share of the action- and back taxes can hurt! Please don't recommend that this is a way to do things that aren't taxable.
Other than that one point- loved it.

This made me smile about the $200 per BTC I'm missing out on right now ;)

or plummet? 
just a little speculation- easy money in means more people can buy. more people buying means more people can be easily frightened. I think what we are looking at now is a combination of a lot of factors at once, but one factor is new exposure to users, who are panic selling.
also- part of the price is based on the difficulty. difficulty to mine, difficulty to purchase.
TL;DR: who knows. I like reading and guessing, but not worrying too much about what will happen next!

He said $70. So seems like he might have updated that, but not the reward. Otherwise, great vid!

Ohh.... cool. So if I print that QR code that is used to register my device- I could then link up an Authencator on another device, etc- at a later time?
