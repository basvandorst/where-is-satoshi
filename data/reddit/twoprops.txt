Twenty-four hours without a crash using bitcoind built-from-source. Thanks for the idea! 13 mbtc (hope I'm using this correctly).

I'm now three hours in running bitcoind built from source. No crashes, and *far* lower memory use than the apt build.

I wasn't aware of Toshi. Looks interesting. I'll investigate further. Thanks!
I tried a process monitor, but after 3 or 4 crashes/restarts the blockchain got corrupted. Ugh.

Yes, running bitcoind. I have 4GB swap, currently over 3GB free. The crashes have mostly occurred *after* the blockchain was downloaded. It seems to always have free memory, though of course the pesky thing has never crashed when I was actually watching it.

Great idea. Trying it now. If it goes 24 hours without a crash, you'll have earned your username.

Root? No, it's running in userspace. Running as root seems... reckless. If the code actually requires it, there's something seriously amiss in the security model.
Architecture? i386 (32 bit Ubuntu 14.04.3).
Binary per the instructions at bitcoin.org, from the apt Bitcoin Personal Package Archive. I can try compiling from source; is the bitcoin GitHub repository canonical? 
It doesn't look like a memory issue as memory usage doesn't grow over time, though it could be a sudden event. Increasing RAM from 1GB to 4GB didn't really change the behavior.  suggesting of using **-minrelaytxfee=0.00005** didn't make any difference either.
When it crashed last night, it did actually log an error:
