At this moment, the line on the graph drops to zero for today.
I think to create a log scale, simply plot log(x) instead of x.  Or if you want the value to be more readable to humans, you could plot log(x)/log(10).  Some languages call this lox(x,10).  This plot tells roughly the number of digits minus 1..... 2-2.999 represent 100-999.  If your axis has x on it, it makes sense to humans.
Id have to experiment with jquery to figure it out.

The problem with the "it'll always go up" logic isn't a problem inherent in bitcoin, it's a problem inherent in people.
When people think collectively that something will always go up, they will over-buy it, and prove themselves wrong.  That's one reason we've seen bubbles in the past, I think.
We're generally in agreement though.

I was thinking that if people hold half and use half, then there's an economy of 10.5M bitcoins in circulation.   If there's fractional reserve, and so people circulate 21M bitcoins while holding their "other half", then the exchange rate of real bitcoins goes down.
Hard for me to explain, but that was my logic.  If you are the only one holding a bitcoin, without participating in the reserve fiasco, you are still impacted.

Starting about last July, dollar withdraws were either halted or severely delayed.
Some time after that, bitcoin withdraws had occasional issues.  By October or November, there were a lot of complaints of BTC withdraws.  But a high percent were going through.
In an effort to diagnose and respond to complaints, Gox began publishing each BTC withdraw, so you could track success.  And failures were on the rise.
In early February, they stopped withdraws, saying it was like trying to repair a car as it sped down the highway.
By late February, they shut off trades, and went "dark". Then they filed for protection.

Note... a paper wallet is not a *backup*, in that you are moving your bitcoins to paper.
Once you've transferred them to paper, you can make a backup copy of the paper.
If you create a paper wallet (on coinbase, for example), it isn't a backup.  If you fund it, you've moved them.  You still only have one copy.  If you don't fund it, it's worthless.

There is one simple question that we are trying to answer: was it a financially smart decision to spend 102 bitcoins to get 50 in return.  Period.
You are trying to confuse it with multiple other decisions such as "should I, at the same time, buy 102 more bitcoins?"  You could also confuse it with "should I, at the same time, buy XYZ stock, which rose 5000% since then."  But these questions are irrelevant to the simple question, is spending 102 bitcoins to get 50 in return a good financial decision.  Which, of course, regardless of the price of bitcoins in the future, or other decisions made simultaneously, is a bad financial decision.
This is basic finance 101.  Feel free to take a course and get back to me.

Years ago, the dollar was a receipt for gold (and before that, silver), meaning you could literally exchange your dollars at any time for a pre-defined amount of a metal.  Now, the claim that it is "backed" by the full faith and credit is meaningless in the old context, because you can't Exchange it for some amount of credit.

A solution that would help is if the pool **owners** that have less than 5% share would switch to p2pool.  They will likely, one by one, be put out of business.  By joining p2pool, they prop up (temporarily) p2pool, even though they add a layer of centralization.  They would decrease their variance by joining p2pool, and potentially stay in business a little longer.
We've already seen pools hang it up when their variance gets too large because they get too Small.  Do the right thing for bitcoin, and prop up p2pool.  Don't just fade into oblivion.

It's possible to do this, but most nodes won't forward a second spend.  So you'd need to work a deal with a mining pool and get them the transaction.
And it doesn't sound like it applies to the situation above, because it sounds like he's the recipient of the hung transaction, and only the sender can resend.

You realize that if it were possible to generate a 100% vanity address of the entire length of a bitcoin address, that would mean that bitcoin is doomed.
All you'd need to do is generate a vanity address that is the same as one with a lot of bitcoins, and then you could spend them.

The original 3 factors in 3 factor security were who you are, what you know, and what you have.
Now people use the term like 3 factors: password (what you know), google auth (what you have), and sms (what you have).  In old terminology, that would still be 2factor, but seems to be accepted as 3 now.
Not too many people are doing "who you are" (biometric).
If you had 2 passwords, I doubt people would recognize that as 2 factor.

I think you have to look at gox like a closed system.
Few people will make a deposit.  No one can make a withdraw.  So you have a certain amount of fiat and a certain amount of bitcoins stuck in there.
People are probably hedging their bets... some might be going 50/50 in fiat vs bitcoin.  Some might believe that fiat will come out of a lawsuit easier if there's a collapse of gox.
Some might be betting that the bitcoin price will go lower before it goes higher.
But I think it helps to think of it as a closed system.

This is just an education problem.  Many people, like don't fully understand the way this works.
There is no financial advantage of a 30% pool over a 10% pool.  You would own 3 times as much of the pool's hash power, and triple the payout of a third of the rewards, in the smaller pool. So, the same end result.
However, pool size affects variance.  If you get too small, the variance can make the larger pool worth while.  Case in point is solo mining:  clearly getting something from a large pool is better than a big fat zero from solo mining.
As long as the variance is minimal when measured over one difficulty period, the size of the pool doesn't matter for your profitability.  But if it's too large of variance through a difficulty adjustment (e.g. solo mining, or really small pool), profitability suffers.
So join a pool bigger than 5% and less than 15% for the good of bitcoin.

Bitcoin-QT currently allows the following, which I'd call funds loss:
1.  Say you have 100 BTC in QT and you spend 1 BTC of it at overstock.com.  
2.  Say someone mutates that transaction, whether it be a fast hacker or a malicious miner.  
3.  Say your 99 bitcoins are returned as change.  
4.  Say you then pay those 99 BTC to a paper wallet for security, and delete your QT wallet file.
The transaction in step 3 will not go through, even though your wallet on step 3 shows that your balance is zero, so you assume you can delete your wallet file.
This is a contrived example, but very much possible, and the patch to this has already been merged (but not released).

... and for those that want fiat, Bitpay simply transfers the coins to Bitstamp, sells the bitcoins, moves the fiat to their bank via a wire transfer, executes a paypal transfer from the bank (possibly through Dwolla), and then paypals the money to the merchant.
Easy Peasy.

No.no. a thousand times no.
It is faith in the **government** that they can retain power, and will live up to obligations, without inflating the hell out of the currency.
While currency speculators may base demand (and therefore exchange rate) on the strength of the US economy, that is because the strength of the economy increases the likelihood that the government lives up to its obligations.
You can bet if the government announced that they were starting fresh, disavowing all debts, the dollar value would plummet, regardless of whether the 500 largest US companies had a banner year.
You aren't betting on companies, you are betting on the government.

I've spoken out strongly against Gox, but I can't agree that it's somehow obvious that they ran down the price.  They have crappy press releases, which may be what you're referring to, but it's their users that are determining the price.
Besides crappy press releases, the ways Gox could be manipulating the price are either to flood the sell order book, or to block the flow on the buy order book.  Both of those steps would be obvious, and I've seen no evidence of either.

In an all-bitcoin world, governments could still exert control over the economy.  It just wouldn't be by printing more or less money.  
Governments could receive tax revenues and spend less than they bring in.  And then when they wanted to stimulate the economy, they'd have money to stimulate with.
Of course, that requires restraint and saving (hoarding?) in good times, which governments generally fail at.

There's money to be made in turbulent markets.
But I think you are seeing this slightly wrong.  Good and bad news is happening literally every day.  The price is going to do whatever.  And then people loudly celebrate or bemoan the news, as if the news caused the fluctuation.
Example:  last year, March, the blockchain forked.  After some turbulence for a few hours, the price soared.  Then people celebrated the good news (how quick the devs fixed it) while forgetting that it was really bad news.
The price will fluctuate.  People will bitch (at gox for example) when it's down.  Sometimes I wonder how much fluctuation is random (or even predictable) and how much the news is used to falsely "explain" (and reinforce) the randomness.  There's been a ton of good news lately that is buried due to the gox bitching!

I've been involved in cryptography since the '80's and digital currency since the early '90's.  With that background, I can absolutely understand Satoshi's motives for privacy.
If he believes in the project, he believes that its success can disrupt some very powerful people and industries.  His life isn't in danger (not only) because of thugs wanting to ransack his house and kidnap his kids.  His very freedom is at stake.
Think about Charlie Shrem.  He's fucked.  Think about Phil Zimmerman.   They fucked with him for years.  Think about Charles Lindbergh.  Wealth stole his baby.  Think about e-gold and liberty dollar's founders being charged with crimes.
The best thing Satoshi could do, for his own safety and for the success of the project, was to hide.  Get bitcoin into the hands of the brave few, and let them push it forward.  He may be secretly involved, but probably not.
Seriously, if you saw the amount of shit that Phil Zimmerman got for writing PGP... they threatened to charge him with TREASON, a hangable offense, for assisting the enemy, simply for writing code (thank God **he** hadn't exported it.... they classified it as munitions, same as if he exported a missile system to Iran, after the fact).
Secure money is a *much more powerful* idea than secure messaging.  Powerful and dangerous.

A company buyout will Always be higher per share than spot price.  So that is why analysts always give value at spot price x number of shares.  You are trying to discount it, incorrectly.

It was nice of the traders to hand them a million bucks in fees in the last week.  I guess gox projections let them down, so they're stretching it to at least Thursday for more fees to roll in.  Then let a few bitcoins trickle out, while they collect more fees...  I wonder how many millions they are short!

Guarantying bitcoin is certainly possible.  You just need to invert your thinking.

Your ideas are good, but I disagree with your conclusions.  My opinions are...
The 2011 spike was caused by the amount of attention Bitcoin got by US congressmen (Schumer, for example) trying to ban Silk road and mentioning Bitcoin.
The 2013 spikes were caused by the amount of attention Bitcoin got with the FinCEN regulatory clarity (April), Silkroad closure (October) and Senate Hearings (Oct/ November).

I am not trying to compare the US government (240 year history, powerful people who want to retain power, etc) with Bitcoin, but the "faith" premise is similar.
With the dollar, it's backed by nothing except a bullshit line invented when they moved away from the gold standard to placate people: the full faith and credit of the United States.  Which is basically nothing except a common belief that it has value.
Bitcoin is backed by nothing except a common belief that it has value.
In both cases, it's no backing.  But the basis for belief in the dollar is much sttronger than the basis for belief in the bitcoin.

The block chain answers several concerns for the recipient:  1. Are the coins legit, that is, previously funded? 2. Does the sender have spending authority, and 3.  Are they unspent?
Think of those three questions as a function.  F(x) where x is a transaction.
Right now, F(x) is defined with a big lookup table, and it returns, say, True if all 3 conditions above are met.  Big lookup table is inefficient, space-wise.
An alternative is to define F(x) to be a hash function of sorts, that returns True for all legit transactions (UTXOs) at a high probabilistic manner.  So instead of being 100% accurate, it has an error rate of 1 in 2**256 tries.  This is obviously acceptable (if done right).
So, the trade-off is space for time.  Instead of consuming a lot of space for the block chain, we consume a lot of time coming up with an acceptable F( ) function.  This requires a lot of computing power.  Know of anywhere that we can find a lot of compute power?  Miners!
So the mining challenge isn't to simply search for the needle in the haystack.  It's to find a suitable F( ) function that satisfies the 3 bullets above, for any UTXOs, at a high, but non perfect, probability.

The only thing that bugs me is when you emphasize "mathematically impossible " when speaking about the possibility of transactions being reversed.  It's been discussed numerous times, a 51%  attack could reverse transactions.
Extremely unlikely does not equal mathematically impossible.

Mt gox rate is higher BECAUSE you can't easily get dollars out!
People with dollars stuck in Mt. Gox BUY bitcoins at inflated prices, so they can transfer their coins elsewhere, sell them, and get their money out.

I agree.  But be aware that with a 0.6% load on every transaction, you might do better pissing it away on satoshidice.  
My opinion is that most day traders are net losers.  Mt Gox is the winner.  Just like casinos.

It could be someone invested in litecoin.  Litecoin is botnet-friendly.
It could be someone who is trying to manipulate price for financial gain.
It could be a bitcoin advocate who believes that the greedy noobs who have run up the price recently need to be weeded out.  Exponential growth in price is bad for the long run of bitcoin, some believe.

You can make a fortune off of this game.
Simply bet the even payout bet (&lt;30000), which has a near 50% chance of winning.  If you lose, double your bet and go again.  Keep doubling.
You'd have to lose 15 times in a row, in order to reach the cap (if you started at the minimum bet).  So you'd have to be VERY unlucky.  The odds of losing 15 times in a row on a 50/50 bet are 1 in 2^15, or 1 in 32,768.
So do this a lot, and rack up .01 per bet.  Until that one time that you are unlucky,  then you lose it all.  So don't do this strategy more than about 1000 times, and you should be good.
That will *almost certainly* get you 10 BTC.  What could possibly go wrong?

But you don't need to increase the block size to increase the number of transactions per block.  People need to get out of the mindset that each bit of a transaction needs to be recorded in a deterministic fashion, and start think probabilistically.  Other parts of bitcoin rely on probabilities, but this part, for some reason is being overlooked.

Yifu already said he doesn't expect a batch 4, but if it shipped on the heels of batch 3, at half the cost, with no wait time, it would not only penalize the batch3 folks, but have a far better ROI.  
That means 100BTC spent on a batch 4 would be a far better investment than 100BTC spent on batch 3 and tied up with uncertainty for 2 months.
This whole thing is a series of gambles....  I'm not justifying the feelings of batch3 buyers.... just painting scenarios.

Wow.  You missed it again.
Gold didn't cost $1000+ per ounce to retrieve from a stream in california.  The reason it costs that much now is because it's the most cost effective way to meet the demand, which is at $1300+ per ounce.  Demand drives that expenditure, not the other way around!
If there wasn't demand to justify it, companies flat out WOULD NOT spend that kind of money on exploration, drilling, labor, machinery, fuel, refining, transportation, etc.  They just wouldn't.  There's plenty of gold above ground, no need to go get more, EXCEPT THAT IT IS PROFITABLE.

Hmm.. well since there is always a spread between bid and ask, I'd disagree with that definition - otherwise spot price would be 2 different numbers.
But you have quotes (and presumably references)  so I'll leave it at that.  I'm not going do be a douche like the other guy and try to say how wrong you are, or whatever.
Certainly in a continuous, well functioning market, there's little difference between last price and next price.  In a thinly traded security, though, these can vary widely.

Given that sending also usually implies accepting change, sending can also be problematic.  Not fatal, but you can get into a situation where you have spent money, and received change which you have no ability to spend.
Example... say you have 100 BTC and you accept 1BTC that gets reversed later.  Say the 16 confirmations went by, and so you thought it was safe to move the 1 BTC.  You send someone 2 BTC and the client does that by sending 50 BTC, with 48 coming back in change.
Say then the reversal occurs.
At this point your wallet is hosed.  You cant spend the 48 from either address.
There's logic behind gavin's instructions not to MOVE coins.
You need to rescan,  to re-find those coins.

Coinbase stores your coins.
Blockchain.info (not to be confused with THE block chain) attempts to allow you to easily store your own coins, and provides you a backup of your wallet in case they fail.
Just two different security models.  Blockchain.info was trying to create a system where you don't really have to trust them as much.  It ends up that this is a hard problem to make simple.  Coinbase went with simplicity and "trust us".  Many companies have failed with that model, but coinbase looks poised to succeed where others have failed.

You just turned the conversation into a circular argument.
Chamath Palihapitiya split the price of gold into 2 parts: production and imputed.  As I have said multiple times, production is the value for production (not the cost of production).  It is the value as compared to alternatives.  Essentially what you called "demand from industry", for which (I claim) there is plenty of above-ground gold sitting around.
The rest is imputed, essentially what you referred to as "investor demand" (to make into coins and bars and stick in vaults).  As long as the imputed value is high, miners will invest to extract more gold.
As Chamath said... this imputed value is real... it's what the market feels gold is worth.  But it is imputed.  It could come and go.  The production (industrial) value is much less.
There is PLENTY of gold sitting around to meet the industrial needs.  It's the investor's desires to stick it in a vault that has pushed the price of gold far above $150/oz.  It's really that simple.  Not sure I can make it any clearer for you.  But I think Chamath is a pretty smart guy, and he's Proven that over and over.  And I agree with him.

Yes, the wallets are just as real if you generate them offline.
Its like this... its like a bank with no central office, and you are picking a bank account number.  They are soooooo long and random that they are virtually guaranteed to be unique, Especially when generated offline.
Your bitcoin address is like your deposit account number... your private key is like your Atm card, pin, and signature.  Guard the latter.  You can share the bitcoin address if you want (although you may choose not to for privacy reasons).
Deposit by sending to the bitcoin address.

How are you not getting this?
There are no mines at $150/oz.  But " Normal commodity markets prices trend toward the marginal cost of production" is backwards.  Why would value change to cost?   Cost approaches market price because of something called profit.   Have you taken any business courses?
Imagine you are a potential bitcoin miner.  You look at what you can get for the mining cost, and you decide whether you're likely to make money at it.  The same thing happens with gold mining.  The REASON costs approach the figures you cite is because the price is high..... not the other way around.
You cant convince a potential buyer to pay more simply because you paid more to mine it.  Try selling your house that way... it doesn't work.

@_date: 2013-04-26 11:04:56
Good question.  Lots of possible answers.
The smart-ass answer is "nothing, same as the dollar."
With the dollar, you have the concept of "full faith and credit of the US government", which is really saying that the thing that gives the dollar some value is the common societal belief that the US government will not let us down - and I don't mean to minimize this:  this is far more valuable than, say, the Zimbabwe government.
When buying a Bitcoin, you are buying 1/21,000,000 of all the (leading) virtual currency that can ever exist.  By owning a single Bitcoin, you are guaranteeing that no more than 21 million people can have more than you.
Analogous to my above comment about the dollar:  the thing that gives bitcoin some value is the common societal belief that the math will hold up, the belief that there is value in being able to store and transfer wealth nearly instantly, nearly free, combined with the belief that they will remain relevant (that is, that vendor acceptance will increase, that they wont be outlawed or taxed out of existence, that the system will scale to support more transactions and faster confirmations, and that they will hold up to competitive pressures from other virtual currencies.)  
People believe this because of the millions of dollars being poured into the infrastructure, and because there are lots of talented developers who have a vested financial interest in making it succeed.  And because bitcoins are gaining momentum as they become more useful.
So bitcoins are backed by "the full faith that this is going to succeed".  I.e. nothing.  ;)

You can re-use it, but you should know that it is not as secure, by many many orders of magnitude.
When you spend, the public key is logged in the block chain.  So now, hackers can try to determine the private key from the public key (rather than the bitcoin address, which is much more difficult.)
Generally, neither is possible these days, but quantum computers may make it easier to crack re-used addresses.

Not quite the same as ever.  The double-spend opportunity is usually only possibile until the transaction is confirmed.  With a tiny opportunity after 1 confirmation, and a miniscule opportunity after 2.  6 confirmations is considered a sure thing.
In this case, the double spend could end up reversing a transaction that is SIXTEEN blocks confirmed!  Not fatal, and probably affected zero real transactions.  But a malicious coder could have seen that bug (or worse, planted it), and pulled off a huge heist!

Actually, that quote may be conservative.
There's nothing in the code that says "stop generating bitcoins at that point."  In fact, the code cuts the block reward in half forever, but the mathematical "limit" (if you remember calculus) is still 21 million.
The reason that 2140 date is mentioned is because that's the date that the block reward is less than 1 satoshi.  However, the 8 decimal precision most surely will be extended within 127 years, so its really not yet defined as to an end date.
Source: open source code, and forum posts regarding extending the precision.

No. No. A thousand times no.
You had it right the first time, when you said "address" (although it's more commonly called the "Bitcoin Address".)
You botched it when you said the address is the same as the public key.  They are not the same.  They can't be the same because they are no where near the same length.
The Bitcoin Address is derived from the public key, but it's much shorter and contains a checksum.
Most people don't know about, or care about their public key, although it is revealed when you sign a transaction (spend money).(

A bitcoin is not a desired checksum.  You are describing the confirmation process, which happens to reward one bitcoin address with the block reward (currently TWENTY FIVE bitcoins).
The checksum is a number starting with abunch of zeros, which is merely a proof of work, so that the bitcoins are actually paid out.  But the checksum has no other connection to "a bitcoin".  A bitcoin is NOT a checksum.

The post you replied to was serious.  Not an immediate concern, but true.
When you spend money, the public key is revealed for potentially the first time.  This is different from the bitcoin address, and simplifies the attack by orders of magnitude.
Yes... for now, this simplification reduced the attack from "virtually impossible" to "almost virtually impossible".  But in fifteen years, expect this to be potentially crackable, while the bitcoin addresses never used as inputs to transactions are safer.
Future-proof, dude.

Sorry, but you are wrong.  Check the specification.
 
The bitcoin address is ABSOLUTELY NOT the public key.  (This is a very common misperception.)  It is derived from the public key but they are not the same thing.  (They aren't even close to the same length.)   And both your private key and your public key are kept a secret.  Your public key is revealed when you sign a transaction (which happens when you spend bitcoins or sign a message).
Look at the format of a transaction, and you will see that the public key is included in transactions for all inputs.

Linking to wallets doesn't really imply endorsement.  Otherwise, though,good answer.
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:10:35
Allow me to try.
Transactions happen all the time, around the world.  Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network, meaning that any point in the network can listen to every transaction, but that different points in the network will hear the transactions in different order.
When you hear a transaction, your software can determine the validity of the transaction in many ways.  It can check to see that the spender really has the authority to spend the money.  It can check to make sure that no more money is being spent than once existed in the account, etc.
The one thing that independent users cannot easily check is whether the bitcoins have been spent twice (which would be improper).  IF everyone had the transactions all in the same sequence, then this would be trivial... the first time a coin gets spent counts, and any subsequent attempts to spend the same money would be ignored.  But since the peer-to-peer network is essentially a gossip-style network, where you just pass along whatever you hear (assuming it looks reasonable), the double-spend cant easily be prevented.
The solution is in the bookkeeping function of the miners.  The miners take a collection of recent, unconfirmed transactions, make sure that none of them spend the same money among themselves, and confirm them as a block.  So you don't know (or care) which transactions came first "within" a block, but you can be assured that block "x" transactions happened before block "x+1" transactions.  Blocks are like pages of transactions in a giant book.
The math that the miners perform takes all the digits on the page of transactions, along with a summary number from the previous page, along with a number that they choose (called the nonce) and hashes (performs summarization math) all these numbers together.  This BINDS the new page (block) to previous pages in the book (block chain).  The reason that I say BINDS is because a certain amount of WORK is required to find an appropriate chosen number to meet the bitcoin requirement.  In effect, the miners HUNT for a number that meets the current bitcoin requirement (called the difficulty).  And in order for someone else to Change that page, they'd need to do about as much work!
In fact, for you to change a block from an hour ago, you'd have to do as much work as was performed during the last hour... which is A LOT!  And in the time you were doing that work, more work is being done by miners that you would also have to do.  So transactions that were confirmed about an hour ago (6 confirmations, more precisely) are considered irreversable.
Miners are performing the WORK that puts transaction blocks in order and prevent the double-spend, so that merchants cant get the equivalent of "bad checks" that would bounce in the normal banking world.

Seems odd that you would use dice to get random results and then convert that to a pass phrase .... reducing entropy, and then hash it.

Quick explanation, little boy...
If you love that lightning bug that you caught, the only way to prove it is to set it free.
PPcoin requires miners to essentially "buy" the block, by destroying coins in their possession.  The benefit is that mining isn't so compute-intensive.  The theory being that people wont destroy (through 51% attack) what they prove that they own (by destroying a little of it).  You burn some coins, and later you can claim a block by pointing to that burn.
.... so maybe you would be killing the lightning bug..... no one else gets him either.  How about "if you love virgins, then you must sacrifice one"... that's the age 16 version.

You are not telling me anything new and keep repeating the same thing.
Here are the facts.
Large block was mined on March 11, with near-disasterous consequences due to the old clients who had a bug.  **The large-block fork was discarded** and a fix was put in place to avoid large blocks until today.  Today large blocks can be mined again, which is a test of whether the network rid itself of enough old clients to actually avoid the level of fork that occurred on March 11.
When the first large block is successfully mined without a major fork, it will indeed be a milestone.  It will be a testament to the ability of many independent bitcoin operators to successfully upgrade as instructed.
Sorry you don't understand that. Hope this clarifies.

Put up a fake buy wall before a big sell.  Let the price wiggle a little higher.  Then sell, while removing the wall.
People who suggest that he should have done it a little at a time are thinking like small-timers.  This WAS a little at a time for a big-timer... meaning that there will be more of these once the price recovers and people forget the pattern (which we have seen over and over.... set up a fake buy wall... wait... then pull it and sell).

Not OP but since I agree with him and disagree with you, I'll try:
Spot price is the most recent (past) price.
It is quite possiblefor the most recent price to be $100, while the current high bid is 95 and the current low ask is 96.
This happens frequently when a large market order comes in, eating up all the booked orders on one side.  Then new orders get placed.  Example, say the bid/ask is 95,96.  Then someone buys a bunch, eating up all the asks up to 100. Now the spot price is 100, while the bid/ask is 95,100+.  Then more ask orders get placed between 96 and 100.
Clearly the NEXT trade will be in the 95,96 range (barring some change orders) but the spot price (last trade) is 100.

One point not mentioned yet is that spending bitcoins requires you to reveal the public key for verification.  This is different from the bitcoin address and different from the private key.
By revealing the public key, you are reducing the difficulty of calculating the private key, and there are known algorithms (Shor's) that can be used in the future on quantum computers to hack the private key of re-used addresses.   
Not an issue now.... but new addresses are free, and we're not going to run out of them anytime in this lifetime.  So that's another reason why (besides privacy).

The public key and the *bitcoin address* are not the same thing.
The public key is part of a public/private key pair.  The bitcoin address is a hashed version of the public key, and its much shorter (but also includes some protection against typos).
Many people on here don't realize that the public key exists, since it's glossed over a lot.  In order for transaction verification to be possible, the public key for each input is included in the transaction.
The relationship is this:    
Private key -&gt; public key -&gt; bitcoin address
It's easy to go left to right (calculate the public key from the private key; calculate the bitcoin address from the public key).  But near impossible to go right to left.
When you sign a transaction though, you reveal the public key, making the "guessing" of the private key a one-step near-impossible task, instead of two.

If there are 1 million sellers with Asks for 1btc each, on the order book ranging from $90 to 150, and 1 buyer who buys 1 million btc at market, then the price will rise from $90 to 150.
In this case, the number of sellers is more than the number of buyers, yet the price rose, disproving your first simplification.  And the number of coins bought was equal to the number of coins sold (less fees, of course).
I agree that dumping in hopes of immediately buying back cheaper rarely works.

I disagree.  I would never reveal my private key to some flunkie at the burger joint.  The beauty of bitcoin and digital signatures is that you don't have to reveal your secret to prove that you have it.
Everytime I get asked for that security code on the back of my credit card (to prove I have the card), I think "there's one more person who can prove that they 'have possession of the physical card' (but doesn't)".

It refers to using the address once to SPEND, because spending puts your public key into the transaction, making it just a little easier to try to crack the private key.

Any mining rigs that aren't ASICs would likely be a waste of money.  Any ASICs that aren't Avalon are likely a scam or at least high risk.  And Avalon is sold out.

Ok, so say you accepted coins in the 0.8 chain, but the transaction didn't appear in the 0.7 chain... this is a very real scenario, as this really happened with some transactions.  And say you have received a few confirmations.  And say the sender double-spends those coins, and that transaction gets confirmed on the 0.7 chain.
Now you move those coins on the 0.8 chain.  But the 0.7 chain survives.  Where did the coins go?  See the issue yet?

All of the comparisons of the security that I have seen make the same kind of statement that you just made.... my point is that they do NOT have the same amount of systems supporting them.
Bitcoin has far more mining power currently.  And so the dollar cost to execute a 51% attack (for example) is orders of magnitude greater than the same attack on litecoin.... even though litecoin will have more confirms in 20 minutes.

So to say litecoin is more secure, without considering the current mining population, is silly.

Thanks for posting this.  Most people who are jumping in and out of the market are as reluctant to admit their failures as gamblers are.
The biggest problem with selling during a panic is that you are accepting a low bid, but not reducing the ask - you are merely increasing the spread.  So if you try to buy back, the lowest asking price may have hardly budges, so you lose.

I was comparing it in the sense of how it is bought and sold.  Not in the sense of the underlying asset.
Comparing USD to a car is equally valid.  Everytime someone buys a car, they have (at least implicitly) made the comparison between the dollars and the car, and determined that the dollar is worth a certain fraction of the car.
Otherwise I agree with you, though.  A bitcoin has some similarities to a share of stock (in how they are traded) and many differences (in what they represent).

No, Mt gox gave specific instructions ss to how to get money from dwolla to gox, and the instructions told you to send it to MutumSigilum with your gox account number in the comments.
So the process, after registration with dwolla and gox, was to request dwolla to pull money from your bank, and when it arrives, send it to mutum sigilum.  Then you'd get notice that the money was in gox.  It cost $0.25 (although I never saw that charge myself... I think it was free)

It seems obvious to me that the orders you care most about are the ones near market price.  And so a binary search through the linked list of booked orders, while predicibly O(log n) complex, might not be the best choice.  (I don't know what algo you are using.... I'm just speaking hypothetically) .
Have you looked at placing new orders into the book by exponential searching?  In other words, when a new order comes in, to be added to the book, compare with order  then 2, then 4, then 8, to try to find the appropriate insertion point?  (Order  closest to market price.)
Does that make any sense?
Expanding this concept, you really can put incoming orders into unsorted queues, once you find out how close to market price it is.  Given that orders come and go, there's no sense in putting them in a sorted order until the market price demands they be sorted.
So you could have a sorted order book of all bids &amp; asks that are sufficiently close to market price, and a series of unsorted queues that are further away from market value.  The size of those unsorted queues should ramp up exponentially, the further away from market value you go.
That way, as HFTs bombard you with orders and cancellations, you haven't wasted any extra time on the orders that are away from the market price.

Transactions CAN be reversed.  Sorry dude.
There *probably* wont be any that get reversed.  But absolutely, positively, there can be some that get reversed.
There is a HUGE window for a double+spend attack that could FORCE reversal.  It is entirely possible that a previously confirmed 0.8 transaction **cannot** be reconfirmed on the 0.7 chain because the money was spent elsewhere.
If you don't understand this, then you don't understand either the Protocol or what happened in this case.

Here's my interpretation of what he said...
Gold's value consists of its production value plus imputed value.  Its production value is its value in production.  If you are producing a product (electronics) and you are choosing between metals, what is the "going rate" for metals with a certain property?  THAT is what gold is worth, from a production value standpoint.  And if gold were ONLY used for production, as opposed to value-store, that would be the price.  And in fact, the COST of production of gold (mining) would be just under that, because no one would dig deeper, more expensive mines, because they wouldn't be profitable.

I think people know other people will pull their buy orders when something like this occurs, so they pull their buy orders.  People know that buy orders will be pulled,which will provide a buying opportunity, so they sell now to buy later at a lower price.
Of course with buy orders pulled, many of the "sellers" end up selling low ($105), and their plan backfires.

So you are incorporating the benefits and risks of lending into the argument.
The counter-argument is something like this:
Compare an economy where 21B coins are "lent out" vs. an economy where all but 21M coins are lost, and the rest are lent out, and you'll see that losing coins has no negative impact.  And since you claim hoarding is like losing, you'll see that hoarding has no negative impact.

His estimates are too low.
He's estimating a15 point gain in a half month.  Proper extrapolation would be a 15/120 rate of increase.
So may 30 would be 120 + 120 * (15/120)  = 135.  Execute the same math and you'll see it goes up faster...
Jun 15 ... 135 + 135 * (15/120) ≈ 152.    
Jun 30...  152 + 152 * (15/120) ≈ 171.

Bitcoin has addresses.  People don't typically know their public key, since it's usually hidden by the client until you spend money, when it is first revealed and logged in the transaction.  Clients tell users the Bitcoin Address.
You may want to read the two linked pages on the wiki that have been mentioned on this thread, because you are really adding confusion to this discussion with your mis-statements and clear misunderstanding.
There are 3 relevant numbers in bitcoin... private key. -&gt; public key -&gt; bitcoin address.  They are 3 different things.  And the public key is NOT the number that most people refer to as the Bitcoin Address.... the Bitcoin Address starts with a "1".
The public key is longer than the bitcoin address.  It'd be silly for this website to ask users to enter their public key, because most people don't know their public key, and it'd be non-trivial to go get it.

The security math that I have seen on Litecoin left out a HUGE factor, which is the cost of the compute power securing the network (which obviously changes over time).  The way to compare the security of bitcoin vs. Litecoin or Terracoin should be something like this:
After an hour (or pick some constant time period for comparison), what is the cost in fiat (e.g. dollars) to buy the compute power required to overturn the transaction?
Using this measure, bitcoin is several orders of magnitude more secure, for values of Time &gt; ten minutes.  [Citation needed, but I am very confident that this is true, especially for Time &gt; 60 minutes.]

1. If walmart doesn't have a use for the bitcoins that they receive as payment, then they will convert them to dollars.  ...problem solved.
2. If walmart wants to hold onto the botcoins (say, for use later or as an investment), then less bitcoins will be in circulation, and so the price per bitcoin would go up.  This means that they would bring in less bitcoins as transactions.  ...problem solved.
The bottom line is that no big company can bring in a disproportionate amount of bitcoins.  They can only get whatever proportion is relative to their share of the bitcoin transactions, whether they hold them afterwards or sell them.

Yes, there is an upper betting limit - what I referred to as "the cap".  On that 50/50 bet, it's 500, and the minimum is .01.  So you can double about 15 times.
This was indeed sarcasm.  If you did this manually, or wrote a program to do this 1000 times (assuming you had the roughly 640 BTC necessary to support this system), you would most likely win 10 BTC.  But you have approximately 1 in 32 chance of losing it all.  
So then it comes down to whether you want to bet 640 BTC on a 31/32 chance of winning 10 BTC.  Doesn't seem like such a good bet when you word it that way.

I don't mean to be harsh, but you asked for it...
Ask yourself who the intended audience is.  95% of the people who see this wont have a clue what it's about, nor understand the message.
Maybe you should start with the question of intended audience, and what simple message are you trying to convey.  Then optimize around that.
Also I don't like either bitcoin symbol that you use.  You should use one like the top of this page... 2 vertical bars through a B.  Skip the less common, ugly horizontal bar.  Again, remember the audience and message.  The common branding will be more familiar and associated with currency.

I agree with most every thing you said.  Two problems though.  First, bitcoins need to sit somewhere when they aren't moving.  So they must store value, and therefore, Must be thought of as investment of some sort.
Second, human nature.  People want to capitalize on the next gold rush, without exerting too much effort.
@_date: 2013-05-07 09:38:27
Again, you are incorrect.  You keep claiming that a bitcoin is a number, and its not.
The checksum DOES have a relation to the TRANSACTION that rewarded the miner with the block reward.
A single bitcoin is a unit of account. It's not a string of digits.  It's just not.
Imaagine someone asking you what a meter is, and you show him a rope that is a meter long.  "Ok, so a meter is a rope?"   No... a meter is a unit of distance.  You cannot hold a centimeter in your hand.  You can only hold a centimeter OF something.

The price will fluctuate, of course.  Sometimes up, yes.
My prediction is that the gap will close between the gox price and the price on every other exchange, by the gox price dropping.  Simply because a) people can finally sell and take USD out of gox, and b) don't need to do it by buying bitcoins and transferring elsewhere.
Short term down.   Long term waaaaaaaaaay up.

Actually it takes FAR more than 4 litecoin confirmations to be as secure as one bitcoin confirmation.

You can deposit bitcoin and sell and buy, playing the speculators game, and then withdraw (probably less) later.

@_date: 2013-06-05 10:31:29
This seems logical.  
Another logical consideration is that higher difficulty means greater security (harder to execute a 51% attack) which increases the longterm viability of bitcoin, which increases the perceived value, which increases the price.  But this is a less direct path.

People make a big deal out of the content of the headline, as if Satoshi was trying to hint that Bitcoin solves the problem mentioned in the headline.

Ha!  That's not long term!
A particular day?  Who knows.... I'll say $60 to $150.
But it'll never be below $100 again, after Feb '14, EVER.   And never below $150 after June '14.  Sometime in '14, it'll probably blip to $500 and sometime before the end of 2015, it'll pass the gold ounce price.
And I'm just guessing (with graphs in hand).  Personally, I think the price will wiggle downward until mid September, bottoming near $50.  And then it restarts its slow ascent.

his method definitely does not square with the past, because he's going up 15 every half month forward.  That would put Jan 15th at zero and Jan 1 at negative 15.
If you want to draw the line from start of year to present, and extend it to end of year, it'd be this formula... (13.33 = start of year, present ≈ 127, in 144 days)
13.33 x (127/13.33) ^ (365/144) ≈ 4038
The above is compounding about  +1.57% per day which is about what the 9x return over 144 days this year works out to be.
A more conservative number would look at the flatter trend line over the past 20 days, an extend it forward to the end of the year.  Note, this does NOT square with the past, as the 4038 number does.
Say 20 points in 20 days, from 107 to 127. Extend that line for the remaining 221 days (or total of 241 days):
107 x (127/107) ^ (241/20) ≈ 844
This flatter 20 day trend line is more like a gain of +0.86% per day.  The logic being that for 4 full months we were on one trend line of about double that, and we've moved into an era of more tempered growth.
So a very wide prediction range of 844 to 4038 at year end.  Or zero.  Could be zero.  Who knows.

Just to be perfectly clear.... a transaction (not a double spend) that was confirmed six times could have been reversed in yesterday's action.
User-A pays User-B 100 bitcoins, confirmed six times on 0.8 chain.  User-A doublespends on 0.7 chain.  Innocent User-B pays innocent Merchant-C 100 Bitcoins.  Merchant-C waits for six confirmations, and ships the goods.  Chain 0.8 is orphaned.  Both transactions involving User-B are discarded.  Merchant-C is out the goods and the payment, and does not have a valid claim against User-B because User-B is "even".

You can pick a wildly optimistic end game, like 210 million people someday wanting to own $100 worth....  that puts the future value at $1000 per bitcoin.  
Then estimate the probability that this will actually happen.  Say you estimate that at 7%.  That puts the present value at $70 per bitcoin. 
Adjust for "time value of money" if you think this is a very distant thing.... like maybe discount it 2% per year or whatever.
That gives you a framework, but it's up to you to do the estimating.

If you pay attention to the whole video, you'll see that Yifu says that his choices were to either become a seller or a miner.
He could make batch 2, and keep it, and simply mine with it for personal gain, or he could sell it.
And the question from the audience was asking whether he was "mining with batch 2 or not mining with batch 2."  And he goes on to explain that the original plan was just to mine, and make a lot of money keeping the units for himself, but he and his team made the tough decision not to mine, but instead, to sell and distribute.
And that the whiner customers are such a pain in the ass (my words not his) that he ultimately decided to sell bulk chip orders only. (Which you are confirming with this thread.)
You have taken something totally out of context - the binary decision of "mine or sell", and accused him of being a liar because he tests the stuff that he sells.
So, yeah, I would debate your point all day long.
I wish the whiners would just quit complaining and contribute something positive to the bitcoin ecosystem..... but that's me whining.  :)
