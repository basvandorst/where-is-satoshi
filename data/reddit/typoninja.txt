Bitcoin can have even better consumer protection than credit cards, it's just not there yet.
Check out this talk by Andreas Antonopoulos about this and other interesting possibilities open by programmable money:

If the blocksize had been raised already we wouldn't be in this situation.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:35:54
I think a better evidence of adoption is the [number of daily transactions]( and that hasn't stopped going up.
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:31:42
I think the best course of action would be to immediately implement a blocksize increase in Bitcoin Core that is compatible with Bitcoin Unlimited. I believe this would make the hardfork a guaranteed success, clearing up the current uncertainties.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:05:35
The mistake is to think that if there is a hardfork the Core chain is the "original". If a fork happens there will be two chains, and none of them will be the original. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:14:57
Big blockers are not opposed to second-layer payment channels, nor they ask that all transactions must be done in the Bitcoin Blockchain, all they ask is to let the market decide what is the optimal blocksize, instead of keeping it to an artificial 1 MB limit that was introduced by Satoshi as a temporary spam measure.

At least your comment is still visible not banned like it happens in this subreddit. Let's see if this comment stil stands just after stating this fact. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:49:38
Consensus being what the majority of the network follows, so in the case of a BU hardfork with &gt;75% of hash power that would mean that Bitcoin Core would be the one breaking consensus.
This exact discussion could have happened when the hardfork for the 1 MB limit was done, except that at that time nobody said that clients running old versions and therefore mining larger blocks were breaking consensus, because it's obvious that consensus is determined by the network.
Tldr; if the network decides to hardfork that is consensus by definition. Clients are not valid because of their age, but because the network decides that those rules are the ones that apply.

Research points out that the network can eventually scale to 1 GB blocks with today's hardware, and that would bring VISA-level transaction capacity. You can see the full presentation here: 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:43:16
Shapeshift has been using Segwit for a month now and they complain that the fees are still crazy high. Segwit does not provide a meaningful capacity increase.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:03:06
In what other way can you get lower fees today? I added *today* because Lightning Network won't be ready for a long long time.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:36:54
I didn't mention Bitcoin Cash, did I? My point is that there is a bright future for on-chain blockchain scaling.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:04:51
Lightning Network doesn't exist, and it won't for many many months.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:35:05
Well, it's actually 32 times less acute than Bitcoin, as their blocks can go up to 32 MB.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:10:22
It's not just a "naive block size increase", there are very interesting technologies that are being researched and can be implemented to improve scalability and reliability.
Two examples:
1. Graphene is a P2P block propagation algorithm that improves 20x over Compact Blocks. [Paper]( [Presentation at Scaling Bitcoin](
2. Bobtail is a difficulty calculation algorithm that greatly reduces variance so most blocks are found in the 8-12 minutes window, and at maximum after 40 minutes. [Paper]( [Presentation at Scaling Bitcoin](

But that's precisely the point of zero-conf, because if he tries to double spend all honest nodes will reject the transaction, as they only accept the first transaction they see in the network. Attacking zero-conf is of course much cheaper than a 51% attack on the blockchain, but still a lot more expensive than a regular shopping payment.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:18:47
I'd say 32 MB is 32 times better than 1 MB, and enough for at least a couple years. And when 32 MB won't be enough it will be ready to go even higher. There is already research in 1 GB blocks and they work on today's hardware. 1 GB blocks will bring VISA-level capacity.
All this being said, off-chain solutions can also be added, it's not one or the other. But on-chain scalability is much higher than what a lot of people think. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:34:28
With zero-conf you don't need to wait for confirmation in those small transactions, they take a couple seconds, so the "people in line behind you at the coffee shop" will have to wait less than if you wanted to pay by credit card.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:13:33
It doesn't have to be the first block, it works because transactions are not left in the mempool limbo for long.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:18:40
I had it on watch later, I will check out the Q&amp;A. Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:22:54
What do you mean? That I said 32 MB instead of 8 MB? From what I know 8 MB is the current max block size but it can be raised up to 32 MB without another hardfork.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:05:38
Second transaction won't make it into the mempool, so it won't be a candidate at all.
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:25:50
Everyone is getting so intense over a single unsubstantiated tweet. Shouldn't we wait for confirmation that the rumor is true?
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:33:30
Also it's worth to note that until version 1.0 of a software is released there are no promises of backwards compatibility. In other words backwards-incompatible changes could be introduced before 1.0 without having to increase the major version number.
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:03:02
Ah, that makes sense then. Although I'm inclined to agree with other comments that it's probably more fiat's and government's fault.
@_date: 2015-10-05 05:00:33
I also had my first Bitcoin ATM experience today, and it was the complete opposite, it couldn't have been easier.
1) touch to start 
2) put smartphone with the QR code of my address on the reader 
3) put bills in 
4) touch to buy bitcoins
5) cha-ching!
There were two ATMs side by side and one of them asked for my phone number just to start. No thank you, no.

Look at Android though. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 21:36:50
I'm not saying that Android is winning, only that Android is in some aspect the "Linux on the desktop", or at least the "Linux for the people". It's sad that it's the most closed and restricted Linux though. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:57:03
That's what you say. Satoshi Nakamoto said something different in his Bitcoin whitepaper. The goal always was replacing the old payment infrastructure, no doubt about it.


Escrow services can cover this.

Bitcoin currently has a 1 MB limit on each block. Transactions average around 400 bytes each, so there is a limit of 2500 transactions more or less in each block. A block is mined every 10 minutes on average, so that give us around 4 transactions per second and 360000 transactions per day. 
The solution is clear: increase the block size. The problem is that this will increase the size of the blockchain, incurring in more network bandwidth and storage costs. But because both are getting better and cheaper all the time it shouldn't be too bad and will be done progressively, for example increasing it to 20 MB first and making further increases as use of bitcoin continues to expand. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:24:09
But unless you and only you control the private keys you are putting **unnecessary** trust on a third party, right?
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:07:59
So no need for watchtowers? I had read that LN channels need to be monitored constantly to prevent fund loss. Is eclair using something else?
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:57:58
But if you are getting an existing wallet/channel from somebody else, they also have the private keys, how can they not?
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:23:01
Thanks, I will give it a try if BTC fees go down.
Does it need to be permanently on and connected to the network to keep funds being stolen?
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:17:29
I'm shocked that people support a dangerous contentious fork such as UASF but they consider a well planned hard fork with a high activation limit as something that would kill Bitcoin. Hardforks with high activation limits are perfectly safe if done properly, and much more maintainable codewise.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:55:26
This is in the context of fees being so high that a lot of people won't be able to aford making an on-chain transaction. If we are assuming that you buy an existing wallet or channel from somebody else then you are trusting them to destroy their copy of the private keys, am I wrong?
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:26:50
Do you have a guide to get a LN channel up easily?
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:44:00
My concern with the Segwit code is the huge complexity it introduces because it is a softfork. I would be OK with Segwit as a hardfork coupled with a blocksize increase at the same time. I'm sure the community and miners would get over 90% acceptance in no time if that were the case.
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:37:33
Literally the [Bitcoin whitepaper]( talks about benefits in the introduction:


Bitcoin's goal was to replace the old payment processors (VISA, PayPal) with a non-reversible system that would be much cheaper.
You may think that credit cards or PayPal are free of charge, but their cost is already priced in the goods and services you buy, which is 2-3%.
