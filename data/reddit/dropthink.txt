What's the shop?

Somewhere between 0 and 1m, probably.

I reported it, as i'm sure others did. I didn't visit the .cricket url link they posted, but i would be running some scans on my machine if I were OP just in case.

Don't listen to this fucker. he's trying to scam you. this is a scam account.

You must be new.
Crying out for regulation with bitcoin? We seem to have gone full retard on the original use case. ffs.

That's what did help push it mainstream. Those fees though nowadays... not as practical for day to day usage as it once was.

Solution: Spend Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin to replace what you spent. That's what i've always done anyway. Helps with the capital inflow too :)

BTC used to be a currency. It used to be easy and cheap to pay for things with it. No longer, unfortunately - speculative asset status aside.

You do realise there are many countries in the world, right? It's not just the USA?

It will be £5m to the company the main technical advisor to the government is on the board of, to write a couple of papers on it. £5m to some other cunt related to someone in government for some other bullshit research that will be out of date when it's completed.
Forgive my pessimism for the uk government to actually make good use of tax payers money.

Classic is about 7mm wide, alpha is about 13mm AFAIK.
I ordered a classic and was told to email bitcoinfriday with my confirmation code/transaction ID, which I did and dealt with them directly from then on. Easy.

It was hilarious when the site clocked over -5k, he popped in to the chat to say 'i've stopped now' and couple of other comments, then all the begging began. Soooo much begging to make it rain.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:02:59
That'd be nice. I spent waaaaay too long dicking about making this. ^^^^see ^^^^what ^^^^i ^^^^did ^^^^there?

NOT TODAY YOU CUNTS! My money transfer to bitstamp won't go through for at least another day. By then, it'll have recovered! I want cheap coins goddamit!

All donations help. Your 1BTC will make a difference to someone's life too =]

Please move the 'previous' and 'next' buttons above the player list. It's a nightmare when skimming through previous draws as their position jumps up and down like a yoyo!
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:16:38
Dead for me too. When I put in my identifier or alias, it just says 'Unknown Wallet Identifier. Please check you entered it correctly.' =/
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:21:18
I think you should add a 'general policy' page on the site explaining this. My first thought when i went to your site, was that you guys were probably going to end up being raided pretty quickly.
Good luck with the venture!
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:04:42
I don't see any stipulations on what can be purchased through your site.
Couldn't you quickly find yourself in a position of extremely shaky ground with regards to illegal items being shipped to your address?
Or do you see what is being requested and then politely decline over over email or something, if the item to be purchased could get you raided and jailed?

It's really easy actually. A bit daunting the first time you do it, but everything goes smoooothly. A step by step guide to getting into the game (from the UK):
* Set up an account on Blockchain.info here: 
* Set up an account on Transferwise here: 
* Set up an account on Bitstamp here: 
On Bitstamp.net - click on deposit in the nav, then on the left click 'EU Bank (SEPA)'. Add in the amount (in Euros) you want to transfer in (eg: 200 or whatever) and click submit. You will then be given their account details and a **unique reference number in the bottom right**.
Now, head into transferwise and look for the boxes marked 'you pay: you get:". Put in your 200 Euros in the "you get" box, then click the "make a payment" button.
You are now presented with your sender details. Fill in your bank account number and sort code and click "uk sort".
In the recipient box underneath, put in the bank details that bitstamp gave you in the other window. **Ensure you copy and past the Unique reference number they gave you into the box marked "Payment description/reference".**
Double check you've put in the correct bank details and click 'Accept terms and create payment".
On the next page, you can then use your debit card to make the required payment.
Sit back and wait for it to be converted and sent. And about a day or so for it to arrive in Bitstamp's account.
Buy some bit coins baby!
Then transfer them out to your blockchain.info address for safe keeping/spending.

You can just send your size by email later. They do from US sizes 4.5 up to 16 in half sizes, which is fine for me as I don't have teeny or monster fingers.

I was sat in chat watching the fun. Unbelievable amounts of coin flying back and forth...
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:33:06
You can program it yourself using any NFC reader/writer. The ring has two separate tags in, one for public info, one for private.

Waiting for my transfer to appear in bitstamp still. Transferwise estimated 9am tomorrow (uk time). I may have missed the cheapest of the cheap coins by then... =[
@_date: 2013-10-29 00:02:01
It'll end up in the spam filter. Just imagine...!

Download the chrome extension, I can access my account using that. I suspect the main site bombing for us few is due to cache issues. Have you tried another browser? Ensure you have Java plugin/extensions disabled for starters. I know the guys running the site were implementing further security measure today and I believe the roll out has caused a few issues for a few people.
The chrome extension can be found here:

no problem!
