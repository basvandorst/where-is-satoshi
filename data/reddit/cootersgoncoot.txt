May I ask where your finance experience comes from? It’s my profession. 
I didn’t say people think he’s an idiot. I said he’s talked about much more frequently outside of professional finance circles than in. He isn’t the only person to have long-term investment success. The only reason he gets so much mainstream publicity is due to his political stance and his grandpa-esque, small-town likability for a billionaire.

1) What rule is there that doesn’t allow you to hold bitcoin long term?
2) What does this made up rule have to do with Warren Buffet’s self admittance that he doesn’t typically invest in Technology related assets because he doesn’t understand it?
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:51:55
You sound upset? Are you upset? I bet you’re upset.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:42:59
I hope you know that Buffet rarely invests in anything Technology related as he admits he doesn't understand it (and he doesn't invest in what he doesn't understand).
Oh, and his value-investing approach to the market doesn't really hold true today, as central bank policies have mostly driven markets to the point where the rules of yesteryear do not apply. ZIRP and NIRP have caused a paradigm shift. What they're doing has never been done before and is insanely difficult to model with any type of accuracy.
Literally no one in the finance industry brings up Buffet and thinks of him as the end all be all of investors (because he isn't).  If you say Buffet is your favorite investor, I'm going to assume you're naive in terms of financial markets and investing.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:18:11
Uhhh...what? Yes, yes it did. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:48:25
Nice, way to deflect. A+ for you.
Let me guess. You've read about Warren Buffet in some very well written and informative (sarcasm) Yahoo Finance article. To you, Warren Buffet is the best investor ever!!!oneone and there is simply no one else that even comes close, especially in macro investing (his specialty....(sarcasm).
Put Warren Buffet and Jeff Gundlach in a room and have them discuss a global macro fixed income strategy. Buffet would be completely out of his league.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:40:56
What does Jeff Gundlach’s view on Bitcoin have to do with Warren Buffet’s self admittance of his lack of knowledge on bitcoin and technology-based investments in general? You have refused to respond to my original point this entire time.
Again, your entire knowledge base regarding Buffet is a yahoo finance article you sort of read one day. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:37:21
1) Interest rates, or the price of money today in return for less of it in the future, indeed does affect value investing. You even stated one of the reasons yourself. It afffects every single asset class.
One example of how ZIRP and NIRP have affected value investing, and more generally active management, is historically high correlations amongst asset classes. That makes active management extremely difficult. It’s why indexing has been increasingly  appealing to people since ‘09 and also why ETFs have seen such a huge inflow of funds from retail investors (that will be a fun one to watch unravel).
2) I agree, rates have been extremely low. The lowest in history actually.  And not just the US, but globally. Especially factoring in how long they’ve been historically low, it’s quite odd how low the level of uncertainty is. I don’t think you can simply assume everything’s going to be okay because rates have fluctuated in the past. They have never been at these levels for this amount of time on a global scale. It’s unprecedented.
Let’s not forget the QE programs occurring globally (not in US anymore) and the narrative driven policy of central banks. These types of policies being used on a global scale for such an extended period of time has never occurred before. It’s quite honestly the grandest financial experiment in the fiat era.
How long can this last? No idea. We’ve literally had a 35 year bull market in bonds. Markets can be irrational for fairly long periods.
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:03:38
I think my point was pretty clear. Buffet is not the only intelligent investor in the world, and his word is not gospel to people that actually invest for a living. What one of the thousands of portfolio managers in the world thinks of bitcoin is completely irrelevant to that point. 
Is that clear enough for you? Or is this a standard response you give when you’re incapable of providing anything of value? Please let us all know of your vast experience in finance and all of the other finance professionals you’ve spoken with on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:03:30
Ok, what? When did I say “bonds are equities”?
 I’m sorry, but I’m done responding to you. If you really don’t think interest rates affect all asset classes then I seriously doubt you have any finance experience. That’s honestly finance 101. Changes in rates don’t just affect bonds.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:48:06

You're right. We should have dumped the internet back in the 90s. Dial up was just way too slow, and there was NO WAY internet speeds would get any faster.
Anyone who thought BTC was ready to be used as a everyday currecny at the moment is retarded. The value is in it's future potential, just like TSLA.

Why are you comparing it to a company? That makes zero sense. You compare it to other currencies or stores of value, like gold, which has an $8 trillion market cap.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:17:19
1) I was specifically referring to BCH, which only uses larger block sizes. BCH just used larger block sizes, which would be the equivalent of using more copper wire. Larger block sizes are only a temporary fix. Both BTC and BCH will not be able to scale.
2) BTC is open source. New technology is being worked on as we speak. The way transactions are processed right now will not be the way they are processed 10 years from now. 
3) Other cryptos' user base are tiny relative to BTC. No shit they're going to be faster. So was BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:43:38
Isn't the only reason it's faster and cheaper because they don't have anywhere near the amount of users as BTC? Yes, they have large block sizes, but that still won't solve the scalability problem if it's to be used as intended...a worldwide decentralized currency. That's simply a short-term fix that will be meaningless if BCH gains massive amounts of users.
If that's your only argument...good luck. It's literally self-defeating if you take 2 seconds to think critically.

Yep, you're right, people typically feel a lot more comfortable with DCA and it helps to reduce the risk of them selling out during panics. For many, DCA is probably the better option just due to the psychological factor.

You realize during the dotcom crash, many stocks did “flash crash”. You’re basing your argument off an index. Individual stocks carry a hell of a lot more risk and definitely have the risk you seek to avoid.
Bitcoin is NOT an index. You’re comparison is absolutely retarded. Please just buy a target fund, because you clearly don’t understand finance.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:47:56
So what happens when BCH has process as many transactions as BTC/minute? It's only advantage is larger block size, which is meaningless if it's to become a currency used on a wide scale. It'll have the exact same problems as BTC. 
Based on your argument, you shouldn't hold BTC or BCH. Both will have high transaction fees/times eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:46:11
25% annual return on a portfolio, on a consistent basis, would be absolutely astronomical. Those are returns private wealth managers and fund managers dream of.
If it ever does stabilize and "only" return 10%/year in a good year, that'll mean it's become widely accepted as a store of value and the risk will be a fraction of what it was before (if you measure risk in volatility).
You should probably not invest. Buy a target date fund or use a robo advisor. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:26:56
Yeah, of course most people don't have $20k just laying around, especially to put all into an extremely risk asset. For my 401k, I have no choice but to DCA.
I guess my response only applies to people who do have a lump sum and are trying to decide whether to invest it all right now or on some kind of DCA schedule. We dealt with a lot of clients who came into quite large sums of money through inheritance, spousal life insurance, selling of their business, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:02:19
BCH will have that exact same problem once if it becomes a widely used currency.
Cryptos are not ready to be used as currency right now. They are not stable enough and the tech isn’t ready for mass adoption. But, you’re investing in future potential, just like VCs do. If the scaling problem is fixed cryptos will be rewarded.

I did a lot of research on this for a financial advising firm (not a brokerage) I worked for a few years ago. Can't remember what the sources were, but I'll try to find some this weekend for you. 
The logic basically went like this (mind you, this was for the S&amp;P 500, but it still applies if you think Bitcoin will be worth a lot in the long-term:
1) So let's assume you believe Bitcoin's value in 10 years will be $100k. So, there will obviously be corrections and price volatility along the way to $100k over 10 years, but you're assuming it will ultimately arrive at that price point.
2) Assume it's very, very difficult, if not impossible to time the market on a consistent basis (I believe it's impossible). Let's also assume you have $20,000 sitting in your bank account that you'd like to invest. You can either invest it all at once, being agnostic to what the current price is, or DCA over the next 10 years.
3) Since you believe Bitcoin will see a dramatic increase in value over the next 10 years, prices will tend to trend upwards for ten years. Obviously, as I've already stated, there will be times where it trends downwards and upwards for shorter periods of time, but overall it will trend upward. If you lump sum invest right now, you're going to see a substantial gain, regardless if the price drops to $8k tomorrow, over the next 10 years. However, if you DCA, you're going to keep purchasing portions of your total $20k at higher and higher prices, since we expect Bitcoin to trend upwards over a long time horizon (the key here is "long"). You might get lucky here and there, buying into dips, but you'll tend to buy more at higher prices than lower. Remember, we're assuming an upward trend. Basically, think of taking 2 steps upward, but 1 step down. 
4) It's much easier to understand when you look at the statistics and math behind it. I'll try to find those sources for you. Don't just take my word for it. Just remember, DCA can work out better for you during short-time periods, but the probability of success for DCA dramatically decreases the further you extend the time horizon.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:16:19
Is that a serious question? The determination of interest rates and now QE absolutely effects everything.
When I was a research analyst at a financial advising firm, we mostly discussed monetary policy and not fiscal. Every single call I had with managers/analysts involved what the Fed and other central banks were doing.
I don’t think people realize how much power central banks have. The cost of money is extremely important. It’s not that central banks are acting in malice, but how confident they are in their own abilities when historianical data suggests they’re clueless.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:56:36
1) The timing. It’s pretty obvious.
2) Bitcoin.com owner carefully constructed his statement to pump BCH. He new the headlines based on his statement would fool people into thinking bitcoin.com is BTC itself

My point is that using any type of crypto as currency right now is absolutely retarded. No, you should not be paid in it, no you shouldn't pay goods or services with it. IT IS NOT USABLE AS A CURRENCY RIGHT NOW! Key word is "right now". The userbase has to grow to an insanely high rate and be much, much more stable to be used as an actual currency.
Bottom line is that scalability is a problem for all cryptos at the moment. If it weren't a problem, you'd see all cryptos skyrocket, including BTC. But at the moment, it's discounted for the unknown, just as ALL investments are. No new information came out yesterday. No one knows for sure what the future holds. That's why BTC isn't worth $1 million right now. Same goes for all other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:07:16
You're telling me an extremely risk asset is also extremely volatile?! Wow, no way! Tell me more! I thought assets in financial markets only go up! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:00:47
Except when the price blows right through your stop limit, which will make it useless. I don't think you understand how stop limits work.
Your comment regarding the dotcom bubble is completely inaccurate. What you meant was the market can be irrational for long periods of time and bubbles can last a long time. Crashes happen very quickly, and if a fatal flaw is discovered in bitcoin, or any other unthinkable negative event occurs, the price will crash to being nearly worthless.
You're trying to market time and play on the "Greater Fool" theory, which is extremely risky and rarely works on a consistent basis. 
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:20:19
Eh, kind of.
If I buy a futures contract, meaning I'm "long" the currency (think it will go up in value), that means I agree to buy X amount of bitcoins (whatever the contract size is) @ a predetermined price, say $20,000 @ a predetermined date, say March 30th, 2018. 
So if the price is $22,000 on March 30th, my net gain per contract is $2,000, since I only have to pay $20,000 for something that's worth $22,000. The opposite is true if it's @ $18,000, in which I'll have to pay $20,000 for something that's only worth $18,000 (net loss of -$2,000).
A lot of people, including companies, will use futures and other derivatives to hedge an upcoming transaction. So if I know I have to buy 2,000 bushels of wheat in 6 months to create pies, I can lock in my price today, for whatever the futures contract price is.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:54:49
Lol at historical price charts predicting the future.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:08:03
Because the price you see isn't the price you're going to get. 
1) It isn't updated instantaneously. So it's an outdated number.
2) The price you see is probably the mid-point of a previous trade, or some other estimation. However, when trading on an exchange, there's always a bid-ask spread. If you want to buy, you're going to have to pay the ask, which is going to be higher than the bid.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:34:24
1) It’s pre-tax, meaning your money is compounding tax free.
2) if your company has 401k matching it’s literally free money.
If you don’t put money into a tax advantaged account like a 401k your an idiot. Do you expect it to double every year? Because that’s not how prudent investing works.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:36:09
The Fed is technically not the government but it basically is, as are most other central banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:52:15

@_date: 2017-12-08 17:20:00
1) Dollar-Cost-Averaging IS timing the market. If you're an investor, you're always timing the market, whether intentional or not. A decision not to do something is still a decision.
2) DCA typically doesn't result in greater returns than lump sum investing, especially over the long-term. You might get lucky, but chances are you'll be worse off. There's been a lot of research on this, and it all points to lump sum being superior. Obviously DO NOT invest more than you're willing to lose in a risky investment like cryptos.
But I'm just a guy :)

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:50:16
Alright, that makes sense. Thanks.
I guess my worry was that there's some fatal flaw within the design of the bitcoin network/transaction process that creates a problem that can't be fixed with better technology or a more institutionalized system as it gains traction, like any other kind of currency. As long as it can one day be easy enough where any average joe can use it, I'm in.
I've already put plenty of money it, mostly because I believe in it's ability to remove the control of governments and central banks over monetary policy. I'm just trying to play devil's advocate to find risks I haven't thought of yet.
Thanks again man!

The price of money most certainly is used to affect the value of the currency. If I cheapen the price of money (interest rates) I devalue my currency. This isn't some side effect. The Fed and other central banks are doing this on purpose, knowing what effects it will have on the value of their respective currencies. Just because it's "free floating" doesn't mean it can't be manipulated to a value the CBs desire.
The Fed just uses a different tool to do it. The result is the same.

@_date: 2019-06-28 15:21:49
That works until it doesn't. Over a long term time horizon the probability your strategy will beat lump sum is almost zero.
You're trying to time the market. If you can do that and outperform a lump sum investment over 10 years, it's be a 3+ standard deviation event. Timing the market and being successful consistently is almost impossible.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:09:48

DCA is technically trading though...you're making an active decision not to invest everything now, which is inherently market timing.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:25:13
Why would a halving pump up the price at all of they're known and scheduled? The market already knows this information so the price should reflect if.
Its the same concept of an acquired company's share price increasing right after it's acquisition price is announced. The price doesn't magically increase on e the acquisition a really takes place unless there's doubt this will actually happen. It's already publically known information.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:13:39
Remember, at some point $5 was an ATH. $20 was an ATH. $100, $1,000, etc. 
Again, this only holds true over a long time horizon.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:16:32
That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm specifically referring to people who have a set amount they want to invest in Bitcoin (and have it available right now) but chose to DCA instead. 
Investing a set amount of your paycheck due to necessity is not what I'm referring to.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:33:02
Yes, there is but it's an unknown at the time. In your scenario it could just as likely go from $100 to $1,000, In which the DCA strategy would lose. 
The concept is simple. If you think Bitcoin is an asset that over a long time period is going to increase in value, then you invest the lump sum. It's going to have more periods of price increases than decreases.
Obviously if you can somehow consistently time the market and buy and sell at optimal points in time that's better, but highly unlikely. There are people who get paid billions to invest other people's money that can't do that. If they can't do it, I assure you you can't either.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:32:40
Thats not how market pricing works, though. The overwhelming majority of the public doesn't know about known events for a lot of companies and assets. That's irrelevant. 
If only 5 people know about an upcoming event that will increase the value of an asset and they don't bid up the price to reflect the equilibrium price of that event than they're acting completely irrational.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:11:08
I don't disagree but I'm not sure how this applies to my comment.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:24:29
That's irrelevant. What is relevant is the starting point and ending point.
For example, let's say you decided Bitcoin was a good investment when it was at an ATH of $50 a few years ago and wanted to invest $10k through a DCA strategy over 3 years.
Which strategy do you think would result in a higher portfolio value right now? The price could drop to $15 the next day you invested your lump sum at $50 yet you'd still have a 240x return ($2.4M) on your $10k investment. You'd have considerably less with a DCA strategy.
You're average purchase price would be $50 with the lump sum strategy and something multiples higher with the DCA strategy.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:13:02
Well that's DCA due to necessity. Im clearly implying of you're holding a lump sum and just investing it over time.
Nothing wrong with what you're doing.
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:24:13
I'm obviously not taking about people who don't have a lump sum to invest and have to DCA out of necessity. Thats not even DCA. DCA refers to an investment strategy assuming you have a lump sum.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:16:54
To be clear, this doesn't mean out your life savings in Bitcoin.
My point is that if you want to invest, say $10k in Bitcoin, the lump sum outperforms over a long time horizon of you expect the price to rise dramatically.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:18:26
It applies to all financial assets regardless of volatility. Again, over a long term time horizon the probability of DCA beating lump s is incredibly small. It doesn't apply to a 5 day time horizon...
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:03:42
If you expect Bitcoin to even remotely compete with gold this is not a good strategy. The price right now, as the meme implies, is still extremely low to what most people here think it will be.
Assume you think Bitcoin will hit $100k in 3 years.
If you DCA every week or month until it reaches $100k your gains will almost certainly be lower than if you just bought in a lump sum right now. The longer the time horizon the higher the probability that lump sum beats DCA.
There's research that proves this. I'll try to find links. I had to do some research myself when I first started as an investment analyst out of college as well.
I still think Bitcoin's long term value is binary. It will either compete with gold or become a useful currency once it hits the peak of it's S curve or it will be worth zero. Remember, Bitcoin is currently only around 2% of the total market value of all mined gold at it's current price. It has quite a lot of room to grow if it's to compete with gold.

The public doesn't know or care about most acquisitions either though. The entirety of the population doesn't have to know about something in order for the price to reflect known information.
The people who DO know should bid up the price until it reaches fair value based on the known upcoming event.
Just trying to poke holes in this theory but happy to be proven wrong!

If that's the case then I sure hope you're selling right now.

TIL only tangible assets have value. 
Why are people paying so much for software? Fucking idiots. I can’t touch it, so it’s not real. Who would pay money for video games? It’s just a bunch of 1s and 0s. Morons.

No, there is no “unless”. What you did is mathematically incorrect.
If I invest $300, then it turns to $15k at one point, then to $10k. I lost $5k from the high, which would be 10-15/15 percent loss from the high. No where in that calculation does it make sense to use your original $300 investment to calculate a 1,700% loss or whatever you calculated. It literally is not mathematically correct.

No, that's not how losses are calculated...that math makes zero sense. You can't lose more than 100% in a direct investment (if you're long).

You know how limit orders work, correct? Just because you have a limit in place to sell at $9k doesn't mean your order will sell at exactly $9k. That's not how matching works.

Not sure how you expect mass adoption to occur if other people aren't curious about it.
