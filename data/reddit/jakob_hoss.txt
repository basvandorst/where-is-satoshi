Oh I´m smart enough. And if this is the only possibility to prevent attacks, this tech is shit.

What makes you think that shop owners will put a computer next to their existing cashing systems? You really think shop owners and others will learn how to use bitcoin, lightning and all the other tools only to have an alternative cashing system? And that they will maintain it, with updates and whatever? Why should they? They have absolutely no benefits from it, only a lot more paperwork. And then they have to convert it to FIAT with the HOPE they get as much as for selling for FIAT. 
Get real, Bitcoin is much too complicated and requires too much tech and too much knowledge. It failed being an payment alternative due to too much tech. 
I believe in crypto, but Bitcoin has absolutely no benefits to altcoins. It´s much too complicated, too "techy" and altcoins getting better and better and evolving much faster than Bitcoin. And the whole ASIC bullshit is the Bitcoin killer no.1. Why do you need so much hashpower only to prevent attacks? There has to be a better way instead of wasting energy only to make a PoW (which has NOTHING to do with transactions), this is not sustainable and regulators WILL fight it. In fact to keep climate protection targets, the regulators will have to prevent wasting energy and PoW is nothing else.
These are the main problems of BTC and I really don´t see how BTC will solve this. The mplementation of ASICs has killed BTC, simple. 
Bitcoin has nothing to offer, that altcoins don´t have. But altcoins evolve much faster, waste much less energy and are much easier to use.
Sorry but Bitcoin killed it own mass adoption.

Lol. No. I own BTC and a nice portfolio of other "shitcoins" that have more potential in their first two rows of code than BTC in the entire blockchain. Crypto is one thing, BTC another. Crypto evolves while BTC is stagnant tech and because of the ASIC misfortune and the reality that BTC is chinese now and practically unforkable due to too many divergent interests, it will stay at this level while other coins fly away.

And you cannot even give an answer to the question but only rant? Get grown kid, you have much to learn.

I have only a 2 MBit downstream and 0.5 MBit upstream connection. More is not available here. I always wanted to run a full node but I´m concerned that it will completely use my connection. I´m mining too and I need my Internet for p... erm... reasons. Will my internet be usable with a full node? Don´t want to try out and dump, if I do it, it´ll stay forever. So can you tell me to do it, honestly?
