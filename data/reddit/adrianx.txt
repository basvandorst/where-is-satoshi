If you think LN transactions are equivalent to bitcoin transactions then one would prefer to transact using the most cost effective option. 
Many LN transactions in a channel may never need to settle on the blockchain if there are enough LN hubs and and channel connections. 
When they do, and are written to the blockchain a single LN channel closing represents possibility thousands of transactions but constitutes just 1 bitcoin blockchain transaction. (It's lost fee revenue for miners) 
SW as designed will give a 75% discount to the LN transaction. Bitcoin security incentive is compromised as more and more people use LN less and less will write to the blockchain. The result is less and less transaction fees for miners and less mining profit = less competition and less security. 
LN hubs with high reserve and well connected collect transaction fees in excess of miners without the cost of doing PoW.

Yes LN is a great solution to the problem that everyone may want to buy coffee with bitcoin.  
it's more like not everyone wants to buy coffee with bitcoin as its too valuable to waste on such an insignificant purchase.
I'm not sure it will ever be used for more than keeping coffee purchases off the block chain. 
reducing bitcoin to a checking account managed by a few  centralised Hubs is a sad fate for bitcoin when I can be my own bank.

MMM, it reminds me of that time too, when I discovered how bitcoin worked that exciting feeling grew proportionately to my understanding of existing money system. 
In an Ironic twist the Lightning Network is doing the opposite, it functions much like fiat does as a money substitutes for gold, LN is just a money substitute for Bitcoin.

It's not actually you're being ignorant ignoring the possibility.
Adam Back has already proposed changing the consensus rules from an average block time of 10 minutes to 5 with a soft fork.
You're overlooking the fact that the vast majority of people to still adopt bitcoin believe in continuous monetary inflation. And the changes to alter consensus rules with soft fork scripts is no longer science fiction it's already been proposed by Blockstream.
What's going to happen when the majority agree on continued inflation?
Even the miners will oblige for more income over obsolescence. 
If all bitcoin transactions happened on the blockchain that would not be a possibility. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 23:45:04
Re creating new "bitcoins " they can be created with a soft fork using the new SW scripting language.  They won't be recognized by old nodes but that's not really a concern when they're locked up in LN hubs and never clear on the block chain.

There are 2 issues 1 is economic considerations developers are not economists. 
Regarding 1 the core developers unless they have invested in Bitcoin knowing how the economics would play out should be independently wealthy.
2 the technical limitations of the code. Here I'd expect developers to offer solutions if they held a common view to the economics at play. This is their domain and this is where the discussion is being opposed. 
What we see is no proposal to fix the technical problems (bar Garzik BIP 100)
But reasons why we can't fix it now.
What is omitted is telling - they don't agree on the economics at play, they do agree it must be increased but in a way that supports their own economic vision and technical solutions they are working on.

He may be correct if we did jump from 1MB blocks to 20MB blocks.
But in reality once the limit is changed. the last block on the 1MB limit will probably be similar in size to the first block on the 20MB limit. 
So I think there is a tinge of FUD in the statement. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:20:16
Thanks for doing this exercise,  but in reply to your post above. by mining large blocks miners risk orphans if smaller blocks propagate faster, the faster your block becomes part of the dominant network consensus the greater the chance of being on the longer chain. 
Miners should do their own maths and mine blocks that will propagate the fastest, yet include as many transaction as they deem profitable, balancing this risk is part of the social contract that is Bitcoin. 
We don't need a central authority telling us that 400k is best for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:38:44
that's not the risk sidechain propose. 
The risk is people will pay transaction fees on a sidechain and still keep the 2WP to Bitcoin. 
that reduces the incentive to mine transaction fees on the Bitcoin Network, and that breaks the incentive system that protects bitcoin. 
We already know that block subsidies will reduce to 0 and be substituted for fees. 
hypothetically with the 2WP you can earn BTC by processing transaction fees on a Sidechain while attacking the the Bitcoin network at the same time. 
that's never been an option before. the way things are now, you cant earn BTC while attacking the Bitcoin network, i think its a stupid idea to include SPV proofs into the the Bitcoin Protocol.
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:02:25
Your statement is ignorant, I've put a comprehensive argument forward as to how the economic implementation of sidechains affected the incentives that protect Bitcoin, they have not been met with criticism but skepticism. If there is any resresistance to the idea it's not by accident.
Don't get me wrong I think the elements idea has great potential, I just don't want to see Bitcoins potential destroyed by SPV proofs

@_date: 2015-12-03 16:27:29
It is actually a result of the relay network you just don't understand how orphan risk incentivizes small blocks.
Large block propitiate slowly and have a high orphan rate. Bitcoin is designed to build on the longest chain as agreed by the network. Blocks that don't propagate efficiency to the majority of nodes are orphaned.
Selfish mining only works in conjunction with the relay network. When the relay network is running and miners are using it, orphan risk is reduced by increasing ones hashing power.
When nodes determine the longest chain that miners must mine on in the absence of the existing relay network increased hash rate does not affect orphan risk.

Alts are not a treat, they compliment, greed and fear of loss are a threat.
I want Bitcoin to be more valuable too. I'm counting on it. 
When you can tell me why Bitcoin is more valuable than any Alt that is better in every way, you'll know why it has value. 
Adding new feature to Bitcoin does not add value like you think. It's just the people who trust and use it that add value. 
I dont want Bitcoin to succeed per se, I want the best money to succeed in a free market, I know that will be Bitcoin if we dont screw it up.
New features that change the incentives that make Bitcoin valuable could easily be its undoing. 
 &gt;&gt;We don't want entrepreneurs involved in developing the money.


value is not in the features, it's a byproduct of the users. 
for every up there is a down, the FED system is perfectly balanced, as you point out the balance of ups and downs is not evenly distributed. 
Success is the same we need risk, If we create a system with only upside potential it just means we don't understand or see the down. 
Features that only make Bitcoin better are just a pipedream.
Bitcoin's success is fragile enough as it is, taking on more risk thinking it has only upside benefit is naive and dangerous.

You claim isn't valid! I'd say the most likely time to conceive of the idea of scaling Bitcoin with sidechains is when you first started thinking about how it could be done. 
Restricting the blockchain became a default behavior as you had a predefined solution. And when the idea became fundamental you were motivated to incorporate. 
You're being dishonest implying the idea is a little older than Blockstream.
It's not crappy I'm protecting my investment in Bitcoin, you can invest in changing it and eroding it's full potential. You just part of a handful of power hungry individuals (no disrespect to your momentous contributions to date) who want control over Bitcoin and that is a threat to the future made possible by Bitcoin.

Yes, in a way that's true, still Gavin is the only one saying we should be developing multiple versions of the software, most other developers are beating straw men for political power to manage developed consensus. 
And calling divergent behavior destructive, Bitcoin is way bigger than a hand full of developers jostling for position of top dog, there is a sea of programs out there wanting to work on bitcoin that are kept out by the power hungry.
The biggest threat to Bitcoin is the centralized development process. The ones who have made this obvious to me are the people who don't trust Gavin, saying he's working for TPTB - aka talking to the CIA, CFR and working "for" MIT.
So few people to influence if you want to direct the development of bitcoin. I lack trust of all those developers who are paid by a single for profit employer, with no public profit objective, and founders who have injected millions into changing Bitcoin without actually buying into bitcoin.

Agree but miners will gradually become competitive in a free market in religion to block size optimization and fees as we move away from the Bitcoin subsidies paid to miners for block discovery.
A big switch and wake up comes at every halving, but the clincher comes when fees surpass block subscriptions.

Removing the limit does not imply we want or will get big blocks. 
Huge blocks may cause a problem. 
If there is a problem it should be identified and addressed. 
The probability of big blocks that could cause a problem is just theoretical. (with no empirical evidence) 
Bitcoin is designed to incentivize miners to mine the smallest blocks possible to meet the market demand for transaction volume. [this theory is based on market theory and materialistic with empirical evidence while functioning with in the limit](
The limit needs to be removed to confirm weather or not Bitcoin functions as designed.  
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:00:12
First off the incentive design is not broken.
The important observations here is none of the fees went to the nodes who pay to distributed the transactions and store them.
The fees went to the miners. The same miners who are subsidized with 25BTC every 10 minutes to secure the network in this early growth stage.
The subsidiary is a design feature one of the effects is to distort the cost for securing the network befor the economics of scale can sustain the necessary security cost.

@_date: 2015-06-01 02:48:40
The point you made above is a most important feature to preserve. It is a market incentive to reduce block size.
I haven't looked into your bloom filter ideas with this in mind but if all blocks were to propagate equally regardless of size this would appear to me to deviate from the original incentive structure.
Note I think block size optimization through market forces is insignificant now but becomes more important as miners have to squeeze out profit from transaction fees.

They probably don't because us consumers are a little spoiled, they may when they have scaling issue, and they will have scaling issue.
By my estimation a 8x increase in efficiency is going to allow them to chew off a big chunk of hashing power maybe even 30+% 
They will earn a lot more bitcoin than they need to sell to cover overhead - there is a strong likelihood they will be saving in Bitcoin, and if they grow (I think they will if this news is true) and if they corner 30+%  of the hash rate we'll see a supply shortage of bitcoin and possibly this could start a bull run.

You're talking as if the relay network is part of the design of Bitcoin. In reality Bitcoin is designed to follow the consensus of the network with the longest chain.
Should Chinese miners have over invested in hashing infrastructure and as a result have a high orphan rate because they have fewer than 100 nodes that's not a development problem.
The problem you describe is a result of the relay network not Bitcoin. You're advocating a band aid with small blocks.
More over a limited block size will result in centralization of many outcomes among the most concerning is the ability of investors to remain anonymous and free of state harassment.

it's not a rush, its was planed for March next year and can be rushed for January if needed. still it's just a can kick until people realize we don't need a limit ;-) 
Bitcoin has a chance to relay change things, and i see threats everywhere the Sidechains hard fork being a big one. 
mining centralization is a concern, realistically I have a higher rate of return on my mining now given the input cost although i earn just a few cents a day, 
but keep in mind Miners are disenfranchised from Bitcoin they have their income cut by 50% every 4 years, in effect if there is no growth half of them will have to quit, or scale back. they also are 100% reliant on the nodes run by users so they have less power then you think. to stay in business they will always follow the majority not lead them. it's the people who run nodes that have the power, and if you can control what runs on 99% of them we don't have a decentralized system.  
mining wont stay centralized I agree with Gavin it will go in waves. the next decentralization wave will be part of the internet of things and heating applications, its just time. big mining centers are not flexible and wast the heat they produce.  
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:18:41
It's just a long-term problem if you are in China where there are less than 100 nodes and you have slow bandwidth.

@_date: 2015-06-16 00:05:36
come on.
The nodes propagate the blocks the miners wright, miners writing blocks that steal everyone's bitcoin wont be accepted by the nodes. 
Bitcoin has never been ruled by miners, its always been under control of the P2P nodes, miners are disempowered further with a halving every 4 years.  
people with a vested interest in maintaining the ledger integrity and the protocol should run nodes. I believe they are. (the only centralization is the power hungry jostling to control 99% of them running the same code base. )
nodes should represent the economic majority. Bitcoin is not what you or I think it should be, its what the nodes think it should be. 
The proposed contentious hard fork policy seems to coincide with the 20MB block limit contention. 
it's hardly a contentious upgrade unless there is some other posturing going on. 
to your point, if the people involved in Bitcoin are stupid enough to install nodes that destroy Bitcoin by giving all the coins to miners who cant spend them, Bitcoin should be aloud to fail. 
Punting Bitcoin under a centralized control system to prevent that is also a failure.

the miner doen't change the market price, he capitalises on it, buys cheep BTC sells overpriced SCBTC he prevents others from getting cheep BTC conversations.

I though so too but nullc said it's unlikely they can do it without a hard fork.
The problem is economic, distilled if Sidechains are considered Bitcoin through the 2wp then a new option of interaction is viable you can simultaneously attack Bitcoin and earn Bitcoin at the same time - that's new miners can't do that with this Bitcoin.
Put another way Sidechains allow you to protect your private key while the value associated with it moves out of bitcoin blockchain  onto another blockchain.

Go reread what Hearn has to say on the topic. (He made suggestion that it could be done he never recommended it be done.) Personally I think he wasn't thinking if he even entertained the idea.

Why cant small miners can reduce orphan risk by broadcasting smaller blocks?
It seems obvious if one was competing on propagation time one would optimize ones propagation risk.
It's worth noting so long as propagation time is on average was less than 10 minutes miners will have an almost infinite number of strategies to compete with propagation attacks.

Bitcoin growth should not be limited by the slowest valuable network connection. 
It's not the miners who need to avoid censorship, it's people who use money that need to avoid censorship.
Miners can move wherever its cost effective, bitcoin is going to grow and so it must. 
Restricting growth so miners in China can leverage cheep electricity, hardware and warehousing costs is unfair to the users of the bitcoin network and other miners who have solved the slow internet problem.

Miners can still limit their blocks, in fact they must to optimize propagation and minimize orphans, it's what the nodes will accept that's important, nodes determined the longest chain.
The optimization is pressure to keep blocks small.

Yes it's PoW that is the key, nodes are P2P gate keepers of the protocol that governs the miners and PoW.
It's seems to me it's the number of users that are key to growth, and I'm not convinced that we need more nodes, more like we need nodes to be decentralized, the most obvious is to avoid centralized control - have them running the same protocol but using different code bases.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:50:24
Answering your statement with reference to the post above I'm not part of the inner circle of centralized control so my efforts would be in vain, that also applies to the hundreds of thousands of developers who could make positive contributions but are rejected by the centralized control, software that runs on nodes is under control of a for profit company funded by global elitists.
The fact you and a large number of the Bitcoin community favor this model that is only allowed to mature under the Vail of FUD is concerning.

The risk of orphaning large blocks is an integral to the incentive structure I hope IBLT doesn't change that. We need miners to have to balance profit and block size, against the risk of not propagating.

the biggest risk is damage to the Bitcoin Brand. 
your Private keys if not spent will be valid on both forks. both forks will accept your outputs, it is unlikely that both forks will continue. the least likely case is one does survive as an Altcoin and if so would suffer a manger loss in value.  
if your are not a miner or a merchant or someone who does a few transactions a day there isn't much of an issue other than enduring the fud and mudslinging, your existing coins will still be under your private keys control. 
there may be opportunities to speculate it would be highly risky so don't go putting coins, or leaving coins on exchange that may have a policy that allows them to spend any stake or derivatives from your existing coins.

He uses the existing consolidation of mining and nodes, as a premises for a linear projection that concludes in centralization.
The reasons for mining and node consolidation are nuanced and many. The evidence and the reasons provided don't described what is happening nor is it reason that it will end in centralized controle.
My analysis is rather informal and is used to manage my bitcoin investment. 
The analysis I've done seems to indicate limiting block size results in centralized controle.

I feel the same way about all versions of Bitcoin. This is the only way to prevent a developer conflict of interest.

This risk of an orphan is exactly why miners have an incentive to mine smaller blocks. It becomes a market for optimizing size and fees.

When miners make larger blocks they increase their own propagation risk.
Miners will always find the sweet spot for size to optimize propagation time and reduce orphan risk. Deviation from each miners unique size sweet spot is going to increase their orphan risk.
To prove you hypothesis I think you'll need to model a system at least as complicated as the system we have today.
While that's technically impractical what are the risks in testing it empirically?
The data to date suggest it's not block size limits that encourage miners to grow to compete one size due to economics of scale.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:14:17
not if people like you think we just move over to a sidechain and drop bitcoin when the block subsidy isn't significant enough. fees could become greater than block subsidy in about 6 years. that would be tragic if that growth happened off the blockchain.  
the only thing protecting bitcoin is theat incentives are so well offset, we shouldn't mess with those fundamentals.

@_date: 2015-06-15 23:22:33
it's hardline fundamentalism like this that results in Bitcoin upgrades (forks) that aren't good. (not your judgment) 
The idea is, if there is a problem we can always remain decentralized and fork, but now the tune is if you you fork and we think you shouldn't well excommunicate you from bitcoin.org. 
This is not political posturing, bitcoin.org should always reflect the longest chain not use political pressure to create it. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:42:07
It seems that way but if all the exit points are services like Coinbase and Circle and anyone selling on localbitcoins is hit up with an IRS investigation the benefits of tor will diminish.
Anonymity is needed in Bitcoin to keep it fungible, restricting block size so it runs on a small number of nodes on tor doesn't solve the problem. It' exacerbating it.
We have centralized control of 99% nodes that's what is changing decentralized control is as import to fungibility as decentralized nodes. 
Nodes can be defined as decentralized so long as 2 competing ideologies have an interest in maintain the blockchain. Having 10,000 nodes running the same code is less decentralized.

The point you made above is a most important feature to preserve. It is a market incentive to reduce block size.
I haven't looked into your bloom filter ideas with this in mind but if all blocks were to propagate equally regardless of size this would appear to me to deviate from the original incentive structure.
Note I think block size optimization through market forces is insignificant now but becomes more important as miners have to squeeze out profit from transaction fees.

To be honest when I first looked into Bitcoin I found Satoshi's reliance on Moore's Law for block size increasing to be a bit ignorant.

This is not personal I am grateful for nullc's contributions, but that gratitude doesn't translate to him being an economic authority, or an architect for the future of Bitcoin - that's for the economic majority. 
You should not forget what makes Bitcoin valuable, it's the people who invest economic energy into the system. 
Blockstream have said their technology allows them to remove the value stored on the blockchain onto a sidechain while keeping you bitcoin secure through a proposed protocol update.
This allows fees that are needed to make Bitcoin secure to be earned off blockchain but guaranteed in BTC, this affects the incentives that protect Bitcoin. 
So long as the economic majority go this way with their eyes open I'll follow but if they follow blindly It'll try and educate them and hedge my risks.
Bitcoin price $380 when Blockstream proposed sidechain white paper $230 today.

fiat is failing, a new system is needed.
the new system that evolves depends on how well educated the people are when its time to choose a new one. 
its about control Bitcoin has potential.  
my point in teh previous post is with Sidechains it could be possible to control the flow of Money much like the IMF and BIS do by assessing credit risk usually forcing up interest and allowing corporate exploration and export of cheep labor.  it would all be done with no trust, but for the trust we put in miners to just mine for fees.

Amazing 0.07 W/Gh is that true?


It still blows my mind how many people don't get Bitcoin. This statement is true for a total of 2016 blocks, that's it and in the scheme of thing it's nothing in the total of 6930000 block before subsidies end.
More efficiency = more mining profit for the same energy input.

I was just pointing out you need to avoid generalizing.
It's a very select few in the Bitcoin community that have taken an interest in the block size debate.
My perception is that those in support of limiting block size to prevent centralization and in support of changing the bitcoin protocol to allow off chain scaling are just moderately informed on the economics at play and ill equipped to debate the topic.
Fortunately they don't seem to be in the majority. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 21:05:00
No fees are the incentive tool miners use to motivate the users to pay for securing the network. A by-product of this incentive is competition to include the lowest fees possible while minimizing block size so the new blocks are small and propagate minimizing orphan risk.
Taking these fees off chain is ok so long as there is a trusted 3rd party.
Taking these fees off chain as part of the protocol upsets the incentives needed to make Bitcoin scale.

It is it's just not economically viable to exploit with 1MB blocks.
I think miners will self regulate as they want their blocks to propagate fast.
I don't hold the view that the block size should be restricted because of it. But would rather see it addressed if it's abused.
That's a problem for Blockstream if they intend to use that space for Sidechain code.

I think your underestimating to what existent the proponents of the block size increase are invested in Bitcoin. (I don't see any evidence to suggest anyone is not pro Bitcoin)
Adam is invested in Blockstream's version of Bitcoin more over there is a conflict of interest as Blockstream's funding could be at stake.
Adam has not always projected a pro Bitcoin position, it may just be coincidental that his views change around the time the seeds for Blockstream were planted.

I don't like the concept of hierarchy in Bitcoin and a centralization of decision making by higher ups. 
This situation is probably just developers empathizing with new users and expressing the obvious choice as a recommendation.
The result in less nodes is a direct consequence of that recommendation and should be acknowledged.
The motivation to run a full node is to preserve the value in the blockchain it you have enough of an investment in Bitcoin to feel it necessary.
Developers would be wise to know it's those who invest in Bitcoin that make the protocol work by running nodes, it's not their place to be direct and manage the $3 billion in value.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:52:45
Totally agree, the one reason for small blocks is maintaining Anonymously in Tor, this is also a fallacy. 
Anonymity is not best server by many small nodes running a centralized code base capable of running on Tor but but many interests running nodes with a mutual need for anonymity, that most likely includes diversified code bases.

there is a difference between a scam coin and an innovative alt.

They have done no economic analysis at all, other than alt coins won't go down because of a 2wp so there is only up side potential.

The current block of core developers who are employees of a company wanting to change the protocol to allow their version of Bitcoin is an eg. of central control. Avoiding this form of central control is the goal.
The protocol is enforced by code, the code is written by developers the code is run by the people invested in Bitcoin.
The protocol is enforced by users choosing what code to run, users should not be directed by developers, giving a small group centralized control of 99% of nodes is not decentralization.

"don't worry" the opponents of the block size increase say. 
they can just fix it quickly and everything will be OK. 
In reality getting the miners and other interested parties to integrate a change before March 2015 is part of why there is resistance to the effort for bigger blocks, people dont like change. 
I like change in price, and if Metcalfe's law holds true we want to process a lot of transaction on the block chain.

it would be fair to amuse if they are testing this space they intend to use it, and its fair to amuse that if they dont want the space to be closed in a bug fix if there is an attack on larger blocks, they would try to prevent people abusing it. 
so no you have the wrong concept on timing, but its happening. 
its not needed to fill up blocks to force people to move when they increase the block size to include their new code, they dont need to sabotage Bitcoin they just need to be ready when its time to move on.

PeterT and the other developers seem to be wrong in their assertion that the goal is to increase the number of nodes. its to increase the number of users, and reduce the number of nodes. 
so long as the nodes are less centralized (ie. competing commercial interests and not all running the same code base) we will have a more resilient system. - it is Ironic to think that the way to achieve more decentralization is by adding more nodes that are homogenous all running a centralized code base.   
I think we are at a growth stage, what we relay need is to fork the centralized code to preserve the protocol.

Sidechains can be anything, elements is a great use of technology SPV proofs are a problem, they will allow value to move off the Bitcoin blockchain onto a sidechain at the protocol level.
In short SPV proofs change the incentives inherent in Bitcoin and will have devastating implications for Bitcoin as block rewards diminish and transaction fees are earned on sidechains. 
No one at Blockstream is willing to commission a peer reviewed economic impact study to disprove thi or study the economic implications this will have on Bitcoin.

Think of Asic mining as 2 things:
1) it's a hardware investment.

The hardware cost is a fixed cost and will be subject to Moore's law market competition will reduce production cost as competition increase.
Energy cost on the other hand is variable cost, when used for mining 100% of the energy used needs to be disposed of as heat discharge and an additional cost.
All centralized mining operations today have this waste problem as a result of centralized mining.
Using the heat is not a gimmick it's called being efficient. You are not going to tost bread with it but it's going to heat water and do other valuable things.

Agree, if everyone has a 20MB block size the fact that the risk of orphaning may be increased is irrelevant as all miners are competing in the same environment, in fact those who do smaller block will have a competitive advantage.
Smaller blocks benefit the nodes, so as the incentives are currently structured I'm happy miners have sufficient incentives to optimize block size without a limit. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:47:30
I would agree with you if the majority of nodes ran on Tor, but the nodes on Tor are so few they just follow the majority of nodes under centralized control.
Keeping Bitcoin centralized so it can have a token Tor node is not the solution we are looking for.

I have an agenda I'll disclose it for you. I want to see the Bitcoin network grow and benefit society.
I don't want other blockchains (sidechains) with rules like PoS or inflation coin to leverage off the Bitcoin network. We are not the economic majority, the network the economic majority use will be the one. I'm invested in making that Bitcoin. The economic majority believe in Fairy Tail economics and inflation, I don't want to see Adam Black vision of a government sponsored Sidechains with all the Keynesian economics fluff siphon off value From Bitcoin, I want it to fail in its own right.
I've asked 3 of the Blockstream developers to conduct an economic impact peer review study and all three said no way. Not one is prepared to invest a fraction of their $21M to challenge the negative side effect sidechains will have on bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:54:29

That's what the centralized node system we have now looks like. 99% run the same code base. More nodes running the same code is not decentralization we want the same protocol running on many different code bases. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:18:26
This debate is a life saver in a way. It's pointed out the irrational behavior of "we can wait until it breaks" and fix it quickly, I suspect what the limited block size proponents are not saying is we the majority - many employees of Blockstream are working on a scaling technology and we can increase the block size to accommodate this solution when it's ready.  Doing it now risks our investment.
Oh and having many types of implementations of Bitcoin is bad we want Core to be the 1 ring to rule them all.

I'll agree Bitcoin has a lot of obstacles to overcome, and it's not an even playing field. 
The concern I've concluded is a priority is the problem of centralized development that's elephant in the room, node centralization and mining centralization aren't trivial concern but fall way lower on the list of causes for failure. 
I'm waiting to see how this plays out, I'll happily back Hearn to get out of this mess and then anyone keep things stable and developing in a health way.

Yes a bigger block size potentially will lessen the need for sidechains.
The VC's are mostly known, among them Eric Schmitt and yahoo and linked in co-founders, the telling fact is they are all businessmen that benefit from network effects.
Another concerning thing is the big names have not invested in Bitcoin (where Blockstream is supposed to add value) 
But rather they have invested in a company with the potential to move value out of the Bitcoin blockchain into sidechains.

This is not a central control conflict between developers, it's an opportunity for users to choose which Bitcoin platform to run. Gavin does not believe in central control he is giving us a choice.

No point nullc and Todd are tough gatekeeper, you've said in the past we should have centralized control of the code, yet are against me choosing to use an alternative, but encourage me to do it myself. 
I'd rather run a node independent of centralized controlled. The problems you're trying to control don't manifest if Bitcoin is unsuccessful and if they do Bitcoin will have more value
 
If you don't think fees will scale to replace subsidies in the Bitcoin protocol why change it.

popularity, and the economic majority are not the same things. Most of the people who hype on the topic don't mine or run nodes, collectively they may control enough bitcoin to make a difference so they have little say. 
Bitcoin goes the way to the economic majority despite what the centralized control system thinks. 
I trust Peter Todd, Gregory Maxwell, Adam Back, on lots of things, but i don't think they are correct on this.
I watched Todd in that video he is fundamental convinced decentralization is a increase in nodes and a decrease in nodes results in total centralization. (I cant see it that way) 
the more open you are to variables the less Saroshi appears to be wrong. I'll give it to you that he is not a god ;-)

I think the proposal is a fair compromise but it's not ideal - the 20MB open cap forces people to be uncomfortable and think of solutions.
The soft cap growing just kicks the can down the road. The full 20MB limit is a good compromise on Gavin's original proposal and gives opponents time to think about it without a dangerous wait and see attitude.

It's a power struggle, some Core developers only look for reasons it can't happen now nothing has been done in 3 years (well it has and it's planning to launch as a solution in the form of a possible sidechain) 
I'm following the developers who express economic understanding, the one who are think 9 months is two soon to implement a change but believe everything will be fine if we wait, and if it's a problem they'll just fix it quickly are delirious or they are working on something else. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:05:05

That is the centralization problem. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 02:20:48


So you've changed your mind and think it is worth doing or you haven't changed your mind and you think it's still irrelevant? How did you address this exactly? 
The sooner you stop forcing the issue and address the conflict of interest the better.
I'm totally concerned about block size you guys have made some valid points. Now is the time to validate! And test the FUD you've been spreading - I'm also concerned but now is the time to test it not when we have a bunch of alternatives. 
I do not want to manage how people use there Bitcoin, I'm advocating that the value stored on the Bitcoin blockchain stay on the Bitcoin blockchain.
You never addressed my concern. MV = PT (M is fixed to 21M and all other are veritable.)
Sidechains look to fix V and T off the Bitcoin blockchain I just want someone to prove me wrong or convince me that's a good thing.
You're just blind to it or don't understand what makes money valuable. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:30:10
nullc, the problem I have with your approach is you have made a very educated prediction based on the facts you have at hand. 
where i see problems with your approach, is you dont have 50+ years life experience, and you don't have perfect information. 
I would be a lot more comfortable if you used your experience and prediction without projecting them into the Bitcoin protocol or Bitcoin's future. 
there in lies the conflict of interest that fuels this debate. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:24:30
When I found out about Bitcoin I understood it was limited in quantity not velocity, and there would be scaling issues.
I would not have seen it in the same light if Satoshi had not have commented that the 1MB block was temporary to avoid a theoretical spam attack. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:21:24
Ultimately miners are profit driven, they will mine the chain that allows them to spend their Bitcoin, that leads to Exchanges and Merchants, and they will serve the majority of users nodes, as they risk double spends if they are on they wrong chain. 
if 20% of miners mine the old Core nodes instead of the XT nodes will have a very slow confirmation time and grow very slowly for 2 weeks.  and the XT miners with 20% less power will also slow down.
blocks will confirm faster where the mining power is and that chain will grow faster sucking in the other miners who are after profit. 
so the way i see it its up to the merchants processors and exchanges, miners don't relay decide nor does the centrally controlled authority that dictates node software as they are reliant on the economic majority.

We have a long way to go before Bitcoin nodes are the size of data centers, lets have this conversation again when my node costs more than my house. 
at the moment we don't need to prevent Bitcoin's growth to make it succeed, we need get out the way and let developers fix the little things - not make statements like Satoshi was wrong, so lets develop new off blockchain solutions for profit or find new ways to incentivise scaling something a minority think is broken.

I'd need to think about it. My gut reaction is the fork would be short lived. The value is in the size of the network and the effort to setup the new pair may not be worth it. 
What you call the trading pair depends on how free you think Bitcoin should be.
If you feel it should be limited in quantity and velocity (you're limited to how much you can spend) I think you could call it BTC-Core (or BTC-Blockstream)
If you think it should be limited in quantity and you can spend as often as you want just keep calling it BTC, no need to give it an irrelevant name like BXT.
@_date: 2015-06-01 02:23:54

It's all about how it's scaled scaling the Bitcoin blockchain has had no progress in 3 years, those same people hindering that progress have been working on off blockchain scaling systems (well they don't call them scaling solutions anymore) but they benefit from delaying the block increase.
Gavin has been working independently on option avoiding the politics, those same Core Developers now say he isn't worthy and is not the lead in the Bitcoin Core project.
The practical solution is to fork. The obvious fork option is XT, Mike isn't the obvious director but XT will enjoy less centralization than Core given the circumstances so it looks like progress from here.

Imperfect market conditions and the ability to stall exchange so you can capitalize on it will become a specialty for miners.  
its not just Merge mind coins that will fall victim to this, even PoS Sidechains will have a degrading impact on Bitcoin and the economy if they ever scale.

Whoever finds the most effective use will have a lower mining overhead.
It seems obviously to me that there are economics of scale with centralized mining irrespective of the incentive design. Likewise there are decentralizing forces too. For eg. home hotwater heaters where electricity is used to heat hot water.

The majority of nodes that form a consensus on the longest chain run the protocol that allows miners to wright to that chain. 
if nodes allow a 20MB block they will let mines mine one, miners are not incentivized to mine big blocks they are incentivized to mine small blocks so they can propagate through the network and increase the likelihood of being on longest chain first. 
if a minority of nodes reject blocks bigger than 1MB, they will be on an alt-chain, miners will abandon it because it it wont reach majority consensus.

its not the feature set that makes bitcoin valuable, it's the size of the network of users who transport value on the network over time that incentivizes growth that gives bitcoin value.
To ignore price and adoption is to negate the incentive design that makes Bitcoin grow and scale.

One thing the author missed however was if one was to change the incentive structure in the Bitcoin protocol PoW may not be effective.
His business proposal dependent on manipulating the very thing he's advocating for.
Bitcoin PoW incentivizes mining and encourages cooperation by paying in Bitcoin stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.
If one where to be able to do PoW on a SideChain say merge mining along side Bitcoin it would be possible to mine on one chain cooperatively and the other maliciously, effectively earning with 100% of ones mining power and attacking with 100% of ones mining power.
 This perversion may be exaggerated , but it would be impossible to do in Bitcoin now but possible if the proposed SideChain protocol change is implemented.

The reason you're Bering down voted is because people don't want to understand.

@_date: 2015-06-04 05:33:36
The fundamental metric necessary for the success of Bitcoin is the number of connections in the network - those are the end users.
The number of nodes is a function of the number of users.
More nodes does not strength the network. 
More users strengthens the network by creating demand for an inelastic supply of bitcoin, that is the beauty of the incentives that is Bitcoin.
The number of nodes will be managed by a portion of those who have an invested interest in preserving the ledger that represents their relative wealth. 
That is a function of the distribution of wealth in society - baring today's perverted 1%.
Nodes should determine mining policy, not the developers, we currently have a centralization problem, in that there are central authorities dictating their visions.    
Developers should develop and let the metric that makes the network grow decide - the end user.

if a large miner can merge mine a sidechain and bitcoin at the same time, he can stop the 2WP by attacking one of the networks by just mining for profit on the 1 and maliciously on the other. 
if there is ever demand for SCBTC greater than BTC and a miner can prevent BTC converting to SCBTC and sell his SBTC at a premium because competition is prevented from converting.

It is feasible and relatively risks free to run a financial business with a 10% reserve requirement. And less in the case of Gox until the run on the bank started. This is not so easy for a household or a small business, Bitcoin’s big appeal to me is it is now possible for commerces to function with no fractional reserve banking, IE all money is hard money and we can bypass institutions that inflate the money supply with through fractional reserve lending (FRL).  
On review of the proposed legislation it seems evident to me that companies like Circle who have contributed a lot to the BIT license process, have created a competitive advantage, as they will be able to leverage FRL at the expense of companies that do business on a 1:1 ratio. 
I fear it will be possible to create a lot of accounting smoke and mirrors, that allow them (someone like Circle) to operate their business on a 10% Bitcoin reserve, and hide Bitcoin profits in Bitcoin by adjusting their internal reserve requirements reflecting a 1:1.1 or greater reserve while in fact operating on a 10:1 reserve with the potential to hide profit kept in Bitcoin by manipulating their internal reserve requirement.  
The capital requirements are intended to serve as the reserve but in fact it is nothing but a smoke screen for running fractional reserve Bitcoin.  Technology like OTX Protocol makes Goxing impossible, and guarantees that exchanges run Bitcoin reserves on a 1:1 ratio. The BIT license almost ensures this protocol cant be used for: 1. the reserve requirements, and 2. the fact the exchange needs to access the funds of its customers to release to the state, this creates a security hole, and potential abuse and risk of exposure to systematic failure.  
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:23:43
what is decentralization? 
I don't think a core group of 5 people dictating what software 99% of nodes will run is anywhere near as centralized as the projected reduction in the number of nodes we have.  
a decentralized solution would have 3 or 4 versions of the Bitcoin protocol running on many nodes. 
arguing to keep centralized control so a small group of people can manage a for profit decentralized solution is at the hart of the debated at the moment, the rest is just FUD. 
I totally agree we need a to find solutions to scaling, but i believe the foundation is already present in the existing incentive structure, and I'm opposed to changing the incentives that allow Bitcoin to scale in a free market environment.

The only problem I see with Blockchain.info wallet is it reuses your address, so if you give personal info on one purchase that retailer can see that the change was sent to the originating address so he can assume that it belongs to you, and track future purchase. 
Also with Blockchain.info wallet make sure to use 2 factor authentication and make a backup of your keys as they only keep the encrypted version. 
Also a privacy concern is linking all transactions to an email.

To understand money you need to think of it as an accounting system, if you believe the market shouldn't choose the accounting system they feel is best to achieve the things money accomplish. You rightly argue they compete. 
Money is not a centralized system that is in competition with other such systems Bitcoin is inanimate it can not win or lose, it is just a system only people invested or not invested in it win and lose.
If Bitcoin is a better system it will be chosen by the market.
Alts only offer more choice, value exchanged by money comes from the people who use the system. 
The reason we want Bitcoin to win is because we're (moreover everyone in the network) is invested in it. 
Thinking it has competition from Alts and needs to be defended by finding ways to stop competition is the wrong approach it's the same approach the FED or connected people employ to protect their money system.
You are expressing a need for centralized control of Bitcoin to prevent competition.  There is no competition the value is in the metric that made the network, that metric is the number of users.
Wanting to stop people choosing other networks and building mechanisms to protect the incumbents in this network is not a strategy for organic growth.
We just need the to protect the existing incentives in Bitcoin to keep the lead all humanity needs is better money, lets leave the innovation achieved with that money to the entrepreneurs they risk success and failure. We don't want entrepreneurs involved in developing the money.

In reality, if the producers of goods and services are more efficiently and all compete on price that productivity gain should in effect be deflationary.  lets say the market can deliver mail electronically with 200,000% more efficiency and we pay 2% more for the service we  only experience 2% inflation but in fact it is much higher.

this is exciting.
knowing the cost of a Bitcoin when looking at the feedstock "electricity" is below $140, and then we've had flat increases in difficulty over the last 5 adjustments - Miners have been able to get a ROI on there hardware. 
so we looking at the mining hardware investment and innovation this will tell you a lot about market sentiment moving forward, 
and we could also see a drawn out 6 months slow grind down as profits diminish. - if the price were to go below $140 and mining difficulty remained consent you would see mining farms closing and hardware auctions. 
or we could see a huge spurt in price staring and a race to get new hardware out and implemented before the next halving Q3 2016.
I'm thinking we'll see a trend down in BTC price, and ASIC manufacturers looking to offload hardware rater then run it themselves.

Jeremy Clark does an incredibly good job of introducing Bitcoin, (best ever) I think some of the questions could be better answered. 
David Tkachuk: Can you deposit Bitcoin outside of the ledger (blockchain) into a bank. 
Jeremy Clark: none that I am aware of. 
Correct answer: No. You sign control of your coins to a cryptographic key under the banks control. This is a touch point of trust and an opportunity for regulation. 
In this video the Senators appear disappointingly slow at grasping the economic principals of supply and demand, even the mining metaphor went over their heads, overlooking the economic investment and risk in mining Bitcoin as a virtual commodity. 
Some Senators seemed incapable of reconciling the testimony from the previous Banking industry and Bank of Canada calling attention to Bitcoin as a highly confidential means suitable for money laundering.  And its tractability.   
Senator Paul Massicotte gets it regarding pseudonymity, overlooks the value in having a finite quantity of currency units that can’t be manipulated by inflation, He rightly asked what is the benefit to Canada in regulating Bitcoin, to which no viable answer was given, I would have said, with regulation existing industries like PayPal and the Big Banks to prevent them from withholding or reversing the fiat side of the transaction when cryptographic proof exists that the Bitcoin side took place, the government can recognise the blockchain as a consensus ledger and use it legally, and as such it can appropriately tax transactions that are legally protected.

Vessenes wins if Gox goes bankrupt legal action is unlikely as it could drag on for years. Vessenes also has a large claim to the 80,000 XBT Gox was holding as banned or from suspicious accounts, this is probably largely left over from the Bitcoinica scandal, where Vessenes is suspected of stealing all the coins that were in the Bitcoinica online wallet (Vessenes's coins conveniently left on Gox before they were frozen by MK)

If you are correct then mined coins are being subsidized by bad business choices.

No the fees would be subtracted from the transaction in a 1:1 ratio peg. (Not mined block rewards.) -

Bitx did not store coins or fiat, they were in effect an escrow exchange.
Bitcoin were sent to your wallet when your funds cleared in there bank.
If you wanted to do a quick sell you would send coins wait 2 hours for your coins to clear. Then trade (it was always too slow for me)
Then there were limits so if I put lots of fiat in the exchange and an order wasn't filled the fiat went back to my bank.  
I guess it is just the way they set it up that slowed liquidity - also the way they did it allowed me to trust there was no FRB.

Inflation kills the poor, they are the last to earn the new money, (i.e. they have the least purchasing power)   
The rich on the other hand use credit (which is adding currency to circulation via Fractional Reserve Banking) so they get to spend pre inflation and pay back post inflation. 
The poor earn pre inflation and spend post inflation, and if they are short sited enough to use credit that is at a high interest that negates the benefits available to the rich.

there are 2 types of SideChains. ones that happen on top of the protocol, these do not threaten Bitcoins incentive structure, they are good for the bitcoin ecosystem.
SideChains that are dependent on SPV proofs run on the Bitcoin protocol level are a real threat.
if I greatly exaggerate the effect you see it, but its a little more gray, this effect only apples to SideChains that require a protocol change. not those in existence. 
Users use the SideChain that is better than Bitcoin lets say it has faster confirmation times. Miners merge mine both Bitcoin and the Side Chain to start. As the Block reward halves miners get less Bitcoin, but its OK because they get more transaction fees from the Side Chain.
as time goes on the block reward diminishes to 0 and the transaction fees dont come from Bitcoin but the Side Chain. miners can now Earn Bitcoin, by mining a Side Chain, but, they can also do a 51% attack on the network at the same time.   
that is the change in the incentive structure, before they couldn't do an attack because the incentive to profit through corporation was greater then to not corporate, SideChains remove that incentive, you can corporate on one change while doing an attack on another, all on teh same network. .

It's actually the assumption above that I'm questioning, Side Chains do move the value by locking in your BTC, why is it assumed the Bitcoin blockchain value will always remain unaffected?
Here are my thoughts.
Bitcoin the currency is a mental bridge to understanding money as memory. The blockchain is the money. The blockchains existence is dependent on the economic incentive to wright transactions to it, it is an economic ledger if you adopt it. (Adopting Bitcoin is agreeing with the utility that it is the ledger.)
When rewards drop to a low quantity, possibly 20 months from now more likely 6 years, transaction fees will be a significant portion of the incentive to mine blocks. The network is dependent on incentivizing miners -to write transactions. In this model there is no wasted hashing, hashing grows to a point where it is supported by the value it provides eventually it grows to the marginal cost of transactions fees necessary to secure the network. The drop in reward forces efficiency. And competition to mine for fees is incentivized by accepting the lowest fees possible. The mining market will tend to maximize profit by accepting the lowest fees that are viable or competition will get a sustaining advantage.
Messing with this has ramifications it changes the core of Bitcoin. It really doesn't matter what miners think so long as they are at least 2 and they are in competition to write to the ledger in exchange for value that is redeemable in that ledger. The economic incentives, the value in the network, will ensure the appropriate industrial energy is invested.
SC offer a secure way to use your BTC (Bitcoin the currency) but they don't secure the value, SC give me a choice transfer the value into another chain if it has greater value, and exchange it back if the other chain has less value.
I only believe BTC has a value because the only way in and out is by moving economic energy to the blockchain, Bitcoin in my mind is the blockchain and the currency are inseparable. It is just money is memory, value on the blockchain.
SC obviously have to be innovative but assuming they offer better value fake or real BTC will lock in. The BTC stay there but the value expressed as economic energy moves across.
To secure this value it will need to be mined, Merge mining is the most likely option as the value will be comparable to that of Bitcoin. The miners will mine where ever the value is. If the SideChain becomes more valuable than Bitcoin (note the value can come from speculation manipulation or innovation we don't get a choice) then miners will derive there reward from the chain that gives the most incentives, nothing guarantees it will be Bitcoin.
We also know Bitcoin will be disadvantaged over time with it's diminishing reward, and if the value is in a SC it will derive the highest reward from transaction fees. SC's could be anything even have an inflation rate however improbable that is it's not impossible, and not unlikely. 
I conclude that miners will treat the value chain as the main chain and the Bitcoin blockchain would become less secure as miners don't have an economic incentive to keep it secure. (They earn off another chain)
Given we don't know who how or what SC will prevail we can probably expect a greater variety than we see with Alts as there are fewer risks. We know if they fail to become the value chain they lose nothing and everything to gain if they succeeded.
SC represent an attack vector fare more viable than a 51% attack, I for one wouldn't want to get 1:1 BTC back if the SC had more liquidity and a bigger network. And if that happened Bitcoin would not be as viable as it is today.
I am convinced Bitcoin has no place being the dominant money or Master Chain unless it represent the economic memory or the greatest liquidity, SC change that, one may emerge that is adopted for reasons that appeal to non Austrian ideals, and absorbs Bitcoins value.
It looks to me like SC enthusiasts believe BTC the currency is inseparable from the value in Bitcoin the blockchain. When in fact SC only secure BTC the currency and facilitate Blockchain the money to move onto a different chain with different incentives or rules. In reality securing BTC is easier than securing the value on the blockchain. I'm a proponent of Bitcoin the blockchain not blockchain technology.

FYI I prefer your option 1 over SideChains and option 2 may have value.
I am aware of many exciting applications for SideChains, I'm not convinced they warranty the risks. The example you quoted is a metaphor to illustrate the economic incentive that would cause inflation introduced by any SideChain that created value over and a above the value of Bitcoin. Yes that's a problem too.
Still a $20m invested in an idea as half baked as this is shocking. The maths and the technical implementation is is ground breaking, but the economic impact this will have on Bitcoin could be devastating.
The potential for problems I see are limited too and depend on the implementation of SPV proofs in the Bitcoin protocol.
It's not FUD, these are systematic problems the easiest to understand is the disruption to the mining incentives how that evolves is complicated to understand, it has environmental implications, it has economic implications, there are feedback loops that alow less efficient systems to compete with Bitcoin, there is service centralisation, risks and the economic cost to cover a abuse and manipulation.
Each topic can be debate with as much discussion as Austrian v Keynesian economic ideologies.

Re read my answer, it’s still “no” Bitcoin never leave the blockchain, you just assign ownership of the coins to a crypto key that the exchange controls. Yes your understanding is partially correct in that the balance you see there is off blockchain, but you are incorrect to assume that balance is Bitcoin those are not Bitcoin anymore, (to quote our new vernacular) those coins are GoxBTC. 
The Bitcoin is held in trust by the “bank” or exchange under a crypto key they control, but it is still on the blockchain.
My point is only Bitcoin on the blockchain are Bitcoin, anything off blockchain is equivalent to a fractional reserve or GoxBTC. One needs to trust the exchange, and breaking this trust should = breaking the law. 
In addition Jeremy Clark should be well aware this of how exchanges operate. 
tl;dr if Bitcoin leaves the blockchain it is nothing more than a promise to pay Bitcoin, Bitcoin never leave the blockchain, it is just  reallocated as inputs and outputs.

tou·ché :-) in that case we could quote the whole paper. Side chains would allow value to move off the blockchain, one could secure your BTC in the Bitcoin BlockChain via SPVproof, and move the value over to SideChain, it could then be possible in time as BTC rewards dropped and tx fees are collected on the SideChain that the main Bitcoin blockchane may not have the incentives necessary to secure it.
the scenario today is imposable, but having SPVproof processed on the protocol level, allows new incentive dynamics that facilitate off blockchain value transfer with secured BTC that is not secured by the same incentive scheme that drives mining today.  
just food for thought.

It's not so easy to make that claim.
You can have it all with PoS, but there are limits, what makes the Bitcoin network stronger than all the alt's combined and prevents a 51% attack is the fact miners are rewarded with Bitcoins that have value that value being digital facilities the option for it to be currency.
If Bitcoin had no value no one would mine it and the network would be vulnerable to attack, so Bitcoin success is dependent on its value.

Bitcoin has resilience and value because BTC the asset and Bitcoin the Blockchain are inseparable. 
The idea that one can take the value out of Bitcoin the Blockchain and move it to a Side Chain, while securing your BTC, is an attack on the very principal that gives Bitcoin value. Miners could then earn revenue on a merge mined Side Chain, as Bitcoins block rewards diminish, the incentive is to mine the profitable chain, one could in fact attack the Bitcoin network while earning a 1:1 convertible Bitcoin on a Sidechain. The incentive for malicious attacks are largely expanded by this proposal.    
If protocol changes are injected into the Bitcoin core by multimillion dollar for profit investments to achieve this, Bitcoins core is at risk. 
This is a fundamental change to the protocol that alters the incentive structure that makes Bitcoin.
The problem I see is some think its a good idea!

The last time the difficulty went negative it was followed by a 6 month bear run.
This is actually amazing though if you invested in a little in mining hardware 2 months ago the ROI was not looking lickly. The talk was you're an idiot to invest, and that's what the numbers said. Well all those miners now have had a ROI on the capital outlay so hardware purchased 2 months ago could effectively run at a marginal cost of electricity.
So that equates to a cost of around $140 per BTC. Miners are either going to earn nicely or the price is going to drop or more sideways. Anyway I guess the point is it's safe to be a miner right now. And well done if you invested in hardware.

I dont know how to access the threat, just the possibility makes be dislike the idea. 
I think the economic conclusion is if they provide value they inflate the value in the SideChain, but not in the Bitcoin, (as it is pegged if the value in the Side Chain diminishes it can come back to Bitcoin 1:1 if not it stays there.) 
as for the existential threat, it is largely dependent on the diminishing return of the block halving, and if the link between the 2 was severed it is quite likely that both could continue just pegged at a market rate.

SideChains are a dangerous experiment in themselves, perhaps even more so than other ideas. Here is just one example of how SideChains jeopardize the incentives structure in Bitcoin. 
lots has been written on this. 
say SideChains exist and one exists that has faster transaction times, and has a set of features that are more amenable to retail, lets call it SC77. 
SC77 is widely adopted as it is 100% backed by bitcoin with a 1:1 peg. In this SideChain, it is Merge Mined alongside Bitcoin for security. Miners love mining this coin as they earn extra revenue and there revue grows as the coin grows.
One of the incentive structures in Bitcoin today that may not be widely understood is the use the emission scheme, a **diminishing block reward** that is used as an incentive to secure the network. 
To prevent the miners controlling the Bitcoin network the reward drops every 4 years. Ultimately we get a Nash equilibrium in the Bitcoin mining space, and so long as there are more than just 2 miners competing, competition forces the transaction fee to a cost marginally above the cost to secure the network. The important thing to note here is collusion in Bitcoin mining results in a change of the Nash equilibrium, the result will always be competition to process transactions.    
in just 6 years it is  quite potable that transaction fees in Bitcoin will be greater than the block reward there will be fundamental changes to how the network is incentivized. Energy costs consumed by the network will then start to be dictated by the cost to process transactions, as opposed to today where the energy cost to secure the network is grossly unbalanced, but favors network growth.
just imagine a scenario in 6 years time SC77 doses most of the day yo day transactions and many people prefer to be paid in SC77, bitcoin is only used for large deals, like cash real estate purchases and large boats or big international trade deals, but for practicality even home loans and big ticket items like TV's are denominated in SC77.
What happens when the Bitcoin rewards diminish, miners get there revenue from the Sidechain. So Miners are economical incentive to mine transaction fees. However if Bitcoin transaction fees move over to a SideChain, and the Bitcoin Block reward diminishes miners will be able to earn revenue on the SideChain while using there mining power to do a malicious attack on Bitcoin with minimal financial loss. The more Bitcoin Block reward droops, the greaterthe threat SideChains proposes to Bitcoin. 
for Bitcoin experiment to succeed all revenue from mining and processing transactions must be denominated in Bitcoin, SideChains are a threat to the very incentives that make the Bitcoin experiment viable. if we get SideChains as proposed we will end up with a system that is not as efficient as Bitcoin could be, and it will be controlled by those who control the Miners.

nice, this is how war is funded, look at the  Ukraine  17.1 billion and an immediate release of 3.19 billion if they immediately bring protestors under control.  May 1st 2014
If you’re a pregnant peacefully women protesting in a government building that means the day after the government gets $3.2 billion you get burned alive  (may 2nd) and then shot.  In this scenario the money isn’t used for terrorism (role my eyes), it’s just the IMF doing what the IMF does, (issue Fiat that doesn’t exist on condition its paid with interest and it funds destruction with out risking real capital.) 
Now in Bitcoin, you can only get money by exchanging real wealth, and you can only fund destruction (terrorism) so long as your net contribution to society is positive, if it is negative your funding will dry up. And you won’t be able to sustain it.  
The debate is a mute point all wars are funded by abusing the money in this way, Bitcoin can’t be usurped by the elite to their own ends.

I take issue at those who think inflation is good, it encourages borrowing and speculation on finite planetary recourses, where deflation discourages environmental speculation. 
 What a central banker and an economist think we need to sustain a comfortable standard of living is only relevant to the level of understanding. They call it growth and assisted consumption.
 What an environmental scientist and biologist think is needed to sustain a comfortable standard of living is only relevant to the level of understanding. They call it de-growth and deferred consumption.

Losing fiat is not beneficial, fiat is the result of a Treasury bond and when the fiat is lost the loser suffers a loss and the public still pays the interest on the bond (I.e we all are still taxed on the debt = negative benefit )  The only benefit is to the bank that never needs to extinguish the bond.
And thinking debt is sustainable is wrong, so long as we are consuming exponentially more the debt doesn't need to be extinguished  and in that case it is evolution that adapts to a depleted plant which is an unfavorable existence for humanity and what we know.

Most distinctly put by Peter-R here:
The issues discussed are related to the proposed protocol change. There are benefits but they don't come without risks.
I don't recall anyone discussing the risks most just focus on the up side potential.
There is an ethical concern too, I've not seen the pitch that earned BlockStream over 20 million in funding without a need for a business plan. 
On the flip side if the proposed protocol change was going to make our Bitcoin more valuable I would expect there to be a an investment in the asset they're adding value too. 
That demand is not reflected in the volume being traded or the price. So no I'm not convinced they are all about making Bitcoin better until they own a lot of it.

Inflation happened in the past by lending money that didn't exist, (Fraction Reserve Banking -FRB) housing prices over inflamed, demand dropped and people couldn't afford the interest on the non existing money. Banks foreclosed on over priced assets they couldn't sell for real money.

While Bitcoin is a hard money it has in effect a P2P open Fed managing the supply and value in Bitcoin. The same function is open source. This distributed knowledge is growing and will become more reliable than the knowledge the Fed uses to manage the money supply, it is an open market solution.
Earlier you criticized an assumption that the problems were inflation based, I'm convinced they are the fundamental problem, in additional under the gold standard Fractional reserve banking was practiced and with the same problems we have today just on a smaller and more distributed scale.
On average it happens that money systems have a life of about 43 years, each new one solving problems with the previous.  We live with abundance but have a system that allows corporations to create money to buy competition, cause inflation and profit from the resulting virtual monopoly in there market space.

It's not just the institutions of government have been copped by corporate interests, but the institutions and the systems largely depend on exponential growth. 
We are at a trigger point austerity for social spending and accelerated systematic protection for corporate interests with unlimited access to capital to create more of the same.
 The result is the very institutions that protect society have been corrupted.
Everything we enjoy is to some degree the result of a misallocation of resources, and we've arrived at a point where the growth necessary to continue is not environmentally sustainable.
I spend every moment working towards gradual reform, but I don't see the transition taking place. We need to start at the root of the problem and that is how we account for the resources we trade.

If Bitcoin wasn't inflammatory I wouldn't be given any. It is precisely because of the inflation as a mechanism to distribute the coins to people who built the network that I was prepared to contribute to its success.
The inflation is one of the predetermined rules you need to agree too before you become part of the voluntary network that is Bitcoin.  
I'm just saying it's not holding the price back because it wouldn't be Bitcoin if it were any different. 
The inflation goes to those who build the network and there is still about 40% of all new Bitcoins to be given to new proponents / users.
Bitcoin was not built to go up in value it was built as a tool to transfer wealth securely, its utility is what gives it value, and that utility is fundamentally linked to the inflation.
If you don't like it it's 100% voluntary and you can use a DPoS system, I just won't be contributing to it.

so be it, I strongly suspect when a faster more cost effective side chain emerge, with new rules, Miners will inflate transaction costs in Bitcoin to encourage the use of side chain to avoid the inevitable revenue drop in block rewards and resulting disruptive competition on fees, this will foster centralization and collusion on transaction costs. 
It is also rational to amuse that any side chain with a value greater than bitcoin will cause a migration of bitcoin to the new chain reducing liquidity, so long as the value remains in the side chain monetary inflation is achieved. 
this will erode bitcoins ultimate potential. Until I see a more definitive study I will remain skeptical of the implementation of SPV proofs in the Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:55:34
they will, all I'm saying is today if you want to attack Bitcoin with mining power the incentives are such that you are better off supporting it.
the cost to maintain an attack results in forgoing 100% of your potential income.  
in a SideChain world should they become popular, new options are available, lets say 3 of the top pools cooperate to 51% attack Bitcoin for 5 days, they would still earn Bitcoin (or SideChain tokens convertible to Bitcoin at 1:1 peg) while they attack. 
This is new I think its bad, but everyone seems to think it's good,  I dont like the idea of earning Bitcoin while you maliciously attack it, I like Bitcoin the way it is now.

The creators of new money get to spend it pre inflation. Thus the working poor the last to earn the new money earn pre inflation and spend post inflation.
Those with wealth get good credit as they leverage existing wealth, the new money from credit is created out of nothing through fractional reserve lending by banks thus the problem is exacerbated. 
Corporations get access to new money creating unsubstantial growth and business models that accelerate consumption the new money gives them a competitive advantage in maintaining the status quo at the expense of  entrepreneurs, thus market needs are unsupported and the perverted status quo maintained  by the ever increasing money supply. 
Wealth goes to the people who spend the new money.

Spin-offs are the way to go, less technical and less risky than sidechains, and could also be merged mined.

Ensuring those Bitcoins are accessible if abandoned is a security vulnerability a vector to get control of keys that are not yours.

I don't use the mycelium wallet but it sounds like it uses deterministic address generation from a seed.
If that is the case you don't need to or shouldn't enter a password to receive a payment. I use Armory and it has a seed backup so all address are predetermined, so I only enter a password to access the private key.
If you use Bitcoin Core the private key is generated when you create a receive address and you will need to enter your password to prove you can access the new private key to spend the coins in the future.

fore every risk there is a an up and a downside. 
I'm pointing out that Side Chains aren't all upside. 
there are 2 types of SideChains, those that work on top of the Bitcoin protocol these i consider innovative and healthy. 
then there are those that require a change in the Bitcoin protocol to make them possible these i consider detrimental to Bitcoin as we know it.  
The proposed change doesn't originate form the community, it comes from a for profit company BlockStream, who has now employed 2 out of the 5 developers with the ability to change the Bitcoin Source-code. 
The upside is we can do more with Bitcoin. 
the Downside is this changes the mining incentives that create the security that makes Bitcoin possible. 
some say its an improvment because miners will get new Bitcoin revenue from mining SideChains, but fore every risk there is a an up and a downside. 
The downside is we know Bitcoin block rewards will drop exponentially, eventual miners will need the transaction fees for income (maybe in 6 years). if miners get transaction fees from Side Chains the incentives to protect bitcoin are diminished, they could earn BTC by mining Sidechaines while at the same time with the same hardware do a 51% attack on bitcoin. will they i dont know, could they yes, but only if this change is made.

Regardless of the profession if it involves an increase in productivity it is dependent on energy. Your point physical labour is hard but not necessary productive is true but a cheap shot at trying to prove we are not doing more work the results of economic growth, my point is we are working more now not because we are lazy we are working more now as we have harnessed energy to do the hard work, and our (you and the collective economic structure) lack of insight into economics is allowing us to give up that and the progress of innovation to inflation. 
I have been open to your position and even believe it for many years after my economic studies. Your attitude and is unproductive and belittling, I see very clearly the causes of income inequality and environmental abuse, I've given you an opportunity to look for evidence or reevaluate what you believe to be definitive evidence to supor your position which is crumbling among an academic economic renaissance.

you are technical correct, however I'm drawing attention to the general understanding of why SideChains are appealing they add layer of trust that your bitcoins won't be stolen this layer of trust would function at the prototypical level. 
If what you are saying is, if you expect the same level of security as Bitcoin when using a SideChain, and it would be irresponsible to believe that your Sidechain BTC is to be as secure as your well managed private key, then I would agree.  
The difference I'm drawing attention too is if one entrusts bitcoin to an responsible guardian, you blame the guardian if something goes wrong, but if it is a malicious miner who steals the bitcoin one can not hold the guardian to account as it is the prototypical that failed. 
The recourse is one blames the mechanism in the prototypical that allowed the incentives that protect your Bitcoin to fail. If that happened it would be devastating for Bitcoin in general, far more destructive than say a MtGox failure. 
having trust is important, knowing who you are trusting is important, introducing new incentives to distribute that trust over the network is a good idea but only when there is central authority who is instrumental in initiating it. Distributing that thrust in a decentralized manner where there is no authority but the incentives in the trust system is dangerous, ultimately this is what SPV proofs allow on the bitcoin prototypical. 
Your response didn't address the ethical use of power trusted to one of the author of the white paper. Where does one draw the line at bad judgment?

The network efficiency is huge when replacing POW with DPOS, no argument there.
The problem is the economic the reword for securing the network goes to the money managers, not the people investing, working and building the real economy.
The fact there is no cost to secure the network means there is no connection between the cost of managing the money and the real economy. The result is **PoS encourages ineffective use of global resources**, (the stake holders direct the economy by reducing the money supply and spending - stake rewords by creating demand where they see value) 
The resulting economic conditions are similar to that of our Fiat systems.

the inflation is fast approaching 10% per year, and will drop below fiat inflation in 6 years, all while adoption grows faster than inflation. 
the question is: **what is the most fair way to distribute new money?** 
when you can answer that question you have a solution, and if it truly is fair, you should expect the majority to agree.
the beauty of Bitcoin is you have the choice to adopt or not, as the inflation rules are imitable. all other money systems before have not been fair and have been forced on people, Bitcoin i believe is the most fair. it goes tho those who build the network.

can you grantee the bitcoin price will only go up? **no** 
same with PoS, but no investment is needed in PoS, and there is no cost either so holders of coin are guaranteed a profit if the coin takes off. and economy based on guaranteed profit for nothing is a guaranteed tax on productivity by the rich. 
becoming rich is not guaranteed in bitcoin, miners only get more opportunity if they invest there profits in new infrastructure and innovation, otherwise they become uncompetitive. 
so miners are risking a lot, and they only risk when there is opportunity, but if the price drops they are screwed. 
play with this  it is all dependent on electricity cost, not the cost of hardware. 
the investment choice comes down to how does one best invest ones energy resource. 
the bottom line is there is not enough electricity to continue expanding indefinably, and we are going to make real chooses soon you and I will be deciding how best to invest our limited electricity supply, and energy will determine the cost of everything we do, including how much our money system is worth in just 14 years miners will be getting about 1.5BTC per block, and energy will be priced by market fores, this will save environmental collapse. in just 20 years the reword will be around .5BTC there wont be any way to centralize mining because the cost will be too high, what will happen is it will decentralize again, your hot water will be subsidized by bitcoin production and similar.

Lots of good info above.
Ultimately it's demand for the utility that gives it value.
As the network grows it becomes more useful - gains in value.
At the moment it is largely speculation in future growth with limited supply that give the volatile value we see today.
If you invest in Bitcoin think of your self as part of a new movement - a P2P decentralized Fed. You release money into the economy when demand is high (identified by super high price) and you contract the money supply when there is little demand (buy Bitcoin when the price is super low.)

He almost gets it, his vision is in effect what we have today with monetarism, however Watts implies new money should come into existence and be dispersed by the state where as new money today comes into existence through banks who steel the progress and claim to be doing a social good by maintaining price stability.
All in all he's quite clairvoyant.
He is wrong about sticky prices though yes they don't come down when we have inflation, but over time competition will cause price deflation if we had a fixed money supply like 100% gold reserved currency or Bitcoin.

I see no evidence this is remotely true, technical yes we have progress but the benefits have been lost to inflation.  It is harder to push a mechanical lawnmower of 100 years ago yes but being employed as a lawnmower today would require your use a motorized lawnmower. Yes it's not as labourers because you use fossil fuel to do the heavy lifting but you are expected to mow a lot more lawn, and to get buy you work a lot more.
Wealth is what creates security we have less today looking at world population than at any time in human history. Less than 1% qualifies as rich the rest are wage dependent with little reserves.


I see your point but time will prove you wrong. The fact is a moderate 2.5% exponential growth target is the goal, inflating the money supply by giving low cost credit to (the produced of the world) corporations to produce more is the where monetarily inflation occurs, the likes of the FED increase intrest rates when growth outpaces inflation.
QE is nothing but a tool to maintain already inflated asset prices. 
The economic growth we have had since wwii represents the largest unsubstantial misallocation of resources in the history of the world and has resulted in a predictable total collapse. 


It's just corporations who benifit, well over 60% of the working population defer consumption by holding fiat the vast majority have less than 1 month in reserve, many in the west have a marginal benifit as the can live off credit while the FED maintains asset inflation via QE.

Yip this was it, but it wasn't just the cost of electricity, it was that as more joined difficulty went up and it was cheaper to buy old coins than to mine new ones given the cost of production.

Give him an answer as long as his e-mail. and offer to elaborate.  (just address the why) 
Bitcoin represents a digital paradigm shift. For the first time in history civilization has a digital asset that can’t be digitally duplicated.  So Bitcoin can be a currency, a store of wealth and cryptographic verification proof, it has many applications for many industries. 
The volatility risk is real; however it is for hi risk investors. A company like ours can accept Bitcoin through a 3rd party service provider eliminate the volatility risk. Companies like BitPay and CoinBase convert instantly at market price so you have 0% volatility risk exposure, their fees to transfer the Dollars to your account are a fraction of typical credit card fees with greater security for both the vendor~~er~~ and customer.

Yes, Bitcoin uses a SHA256 hash function. Dedicated hardware can only do that specific function no other. So it isn't accurate to compare it to super computers that can do a verify of programmable functions.
The PoW idea in Bitcoin can remove the need for trust and proof of digital information and have it be distributed in a p2p network where no one has to trust an authority or central controller.
After Gox, we will see it applied to exchanges for sure, also useful in voting, issuing and validating company shares and many other functions.

There are technologies that can chang this. Bitcoin is not infallible.
BlockStream, is a for profit company who want to distinguish between BTC the assets and the value stored in the blockchain. They have called this proposed change to the Bitcoin protocol SideChains.
With SideChains you can secure your private key that is,  locking your BTC, the bitcoin stay on the blockchain but the value moves over to a new chain the SideChain.
If enough value moves over, and Bitcoin block rewards diminish, in time the incentives could be aligned in such a way that miners who merge mine SideChains could get there revenue from the SideChain TX fees, leaving the incentives that protect Bitcoin vulnerable. Miners could even earn SideChain BTC while 51% attacking Bitcoin network.

Federated pegs are desirable, yes. Even innovative.


Federated pegs needs centralized consensus. There are fiew if any drawbacks when merge-mining a coin with some form of centralization or un-pegged. 
But merge-mining a decentralized consensus coin with an algorithmic or fixed peg will  erode Bitcoins incentive structure and destroy it over time, as described below.
Bitcoin mining rewards diminish over time, and will be supplemented by transaction fees. Decentralized SideChains that generate transaction fees for miners will alow miners to attack one chain even Bitcoin's blockchain and earning BTC while doing so.
This idea shouldn't evolve past being a federated peg if you like the Bitcoin incentives the way they are now.

To your point you are correct, but to defend the argument made a +20% to -20% annual inflation over the 150 time frame leaves my savings intact give or take 20% purchasing power. The average 1982-1984 100% inflation destroys one's purchasing power by 50% in just 2 years leaving one's life circumstances and future security rather unstable.   
Keep in mind the 4% inflation has a direct impact on economic growth, i.e. inflation is synonymous with economic growth, the growth is a by-product as people need to produce more to sustain the same standard of living, encouraging waste. 
Given our finite recourses and energy reserves, maintaining even a moderate 2.5% exponential growth rate will have devastating effects on our recourses. Monetary savings are discouraged creating poverty and instability and investing to preserve wealth is encouraged.  The result is accelerated resource consumption as capital is made available to huge projects (not viable without vast capital) that reduce production costs of goods that offset the inflation cost.  The unintended by-product of increasing consumption of raw materials and rate pollution can be absorption in a finite eco system is parasitic in nature and unsustainable. 
This accelerated inflation is destabilising the very systems we depend the result is humanity is more unstable today than it was over the 150 years from 1776 to 1933.

1)	Should banks give loans to people who can't pay them back just because there is regulation to protect both?
Or 
2)	Should banks give loans to people who they trust can pay them back despite the regulation to protect both? 
The regulation is there to enforce what we "think" is fair, what is and isn't fair is not objective, it evolves over time (beating slaves used to be fair behavior) what is fair is people finding ways to be fair to each other with mutual connect (this option doesn't serve the lazy and ignorant well - a positive benefit if you believe in evolution). 
Regulation makes it way harder to actually see the unfair behavior. (case in point too big to fail banks)

Thanks for your input, your observations don't agree with mine with PoW the economy is the sink for the risk or inflation and deflation.
Bitcoin is inflating but it's value is appreciating faster than the inflation, so you see odd feedback loops. Ultimately it's akin to Keynes's paradox of thrift, but Bitcoin seems to be growing not shrinking. (Keep an eye out as we enter new territory: the cost of production will exceed the value within a couple of months.

I dont support the idea of SideChains, but do offer some benefits:
You can move those transactions to a side Ledger taking the growth out of the Main blockchain.

Re Permanent solution: yip nothing yet, still lots of ideation needed. Still no excuse not to implement a temporary solution of 20MB per block size. 
Re risk of centralization, isn't as problematic as some would have you believe. it is only problematic when entities are few enough to collude, and cooperate. Even at what would be considered a very centralized outcome given distribution today, Nash's equilibrium ensures centralization wont degrade the Bitcoin network. 
Re: how do SideChains change the Bitcoin incentive scheme?
Miners get rewarded for protecting the network, that "value of the reward increases as the value of the network increases even though the reward drops. This is an **incentive** that protects the network and always favors **cooperation**.
As Bitcoin is today miners get BTC by securing the Bitcoin Blockchain with their hashing power. (Not all SideChains will be bad but as proposed they will destroyed Bitcoin over time.)
Today if one uses that hashing power against Bitcoin one would have to give up the Bitcoin income.
This incentive ensures cooperation is more profitable than non-cooperation.
With SideChains Bitcoin can move to another blockchain, miners can merge mine it and earn transaction fees. (In principal they earn Bitcoin or something that can be converted to Bitcoin guaranteed by the protocol.
Bitcoin block reward diminishes over time in 6-10 years it is very likely transaction fees will be the greater part of a block reward.
If miners earn BTC equivalent on a SideChain, they have a new economic option - **non-cooperation** . They can earn Bitcoin by mining transaction fees on a SideChain, and use that same hashing power to attack the Bitcoin blockchain. This is new it is a change to the existing incentives and not possible in Bitcoin today.

PoS reword systems have more in common with our Fiat system today - the rich get more rich by taking money out of the economy.
Industrial scale mining is a result of the demand for Bitcoin. If the price of Bitcoin had to fall below $170 all industrial miners would be out of business.
It is because of PoW people in the network at every level have real wealth at risk, it is the real wealth at risk that rewords innovation and it isn't guaranteed, that innovation and risk taking is what creates industrial scale mining.

All significant upgrades to the protocol are hard forks, it's not necessarily controversial.

TPTB will tell you otherwise because it erodes there wealth. 
Just think about it, if the dreaded deflation happens tomorrow, loans will become worthless, people will default. Industry won't produce because consumers aren't buying. 
but we will buy, we'll just buy the thinks we need (food clothes shelter) and those industries will grow.  
the upside is the decline in the economy is a win for the environment as all the $ people consume wont be viable, deflation is good for humanity, and those who defer consumption. (ie savers).

**a hard fork war** is FUD, any change made to Bitcoin is always going to be a hard fork, a hard fork being an upgrade nodes have to make, a soft fork being a change only miners need to accommodate. 
**we need to make upgrades to scale**, the real debate is do we need to change the protocol to encourage new behaviors or change the incentives?   
my view is the protocol incentivizes miners to mine small blocks. (it seems that the protocol may need some tuning and Gavin has a proposal called IBLT - i need to understand it better before commenting) 
the incentive must be, miners who mine large blocks (too big by market determined efficiency) will be at a disadvantage, because larger blocks will propagate slower through the network, the result is more orphaned blocks and loss of income. 
where the miners who mine small blocks will propagate fast to the nodes and thus will always be on the fork with the longest chain. 
As rewards diminish miners will need to find an equilibrium balancing tx fees and block size optimally.  
i feel limiting block size is a false debate masking other problems or agendas. FYI adding the 1MB block limit was a Hard Fork, it was necessary back then to buy time to gain understanding. and its going to be a hard fork every time it need changing. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:11:11
Gavin is not pushing his solution to scale, he has said lets just make it 20MB while we discuss options.
The debate has been going on since 2012, it's the invested interests in the limited block size who are not willing to change the size while the debate continues.

The odds are stacked though.
The **anti scaling advocates** ( the 1MB blockers - 3 of the top 5 core developers) work for a for profit company Blockstream will benefit if the blockchain does not change.
The problem is with just a soft fork ( a fork involving a change just miners need to implement) 
Blockstream just need to offer miners more money to merge mine Sidechains to deploy their for profit solution. This will change the incentive structure that protects Bitcoin.
The **pro scaling advocates** can't make any changes without doing a hard fork, advantage **anti scaling advocates**

Just wrong here is an eg. how it does.
Bitcoin mining rewards diminish over time, and will be supplemented by transaction fees. Decentralized SideChains that generate transaction fees for miners will alow miners to attack one chain even Bitcoin's blockchain and earning BTC while doing so.
That's a change to the existing Bitcoin incentive scheme. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 06:20:43
The real question is why pay miners more in transaction fees when nodes could store any block size free.

@_date: 2015-05-16 01:45:30
edit* just re-read your post, its not about PoS so sorry for the ramble.  
I have a few PoS investments, but I am not pro PoS for this reason.
with debt issued Fiat, the wealthy accumulate wealth and invest it in interest bearing bonds when the economy dips, or stocks when the economy booms. they avoid risk and are rewarded. The wealthy earn more interest or get growth. The cycle goes in sync with the business cycle forcing money into and out of the economy, it is managed with no risk to the large investors, but comes at a cost of the productive people. 
With PoS it works in a similar way, the Stake earn transaction fees, but do no real work. in times of deflation, when the economy is shrinking, money is increasing in value, Stake holders are encouraged to save to earn transaction fees, not invest in the economy. 
In Bitcoin land the opposite is true, when the economy is shrinking, and money increasing in value, you can get better returns my investing in the economy and earning BTC with a higher value, the money system has automatic checks and balances to counteract the business cycle. 
So being in the Austrian Economics camp, i see problems with PoS.

Another thing that makes him stand out is he has wisdom that comes after your mid 40vs for those life long Lerner's

@_date: 2015-05-04 05:02:26
Soft Fork = only miners change the Bitcoin code, for "upgrades" users not affected.
Hard Fork = every Bitcoin user must "upgrade" before updates will be accepted.
At the moment the 1MB block limit is set as part of the protocol. So unless everyone is in agreement including developers (and they are not in agreement) on how it needs to be changed, the change only gets made if every Bitcoin user who runs Bitcoin upgrades to the same version at the same time the upgrade doesn't happen.
There are lots of competing interests, big business would like it limited so people do off blockchain transaction and they get to charge for there services and control development. 
Librarians and free market advocates would like Bitcoin to scale so it isn't controlled by a few interest groups.
Gavin proposing a hard fork isn't all that harsh when you think we have to do it even if we only change 1 line of code. And adjust the 1MB block to 2MB block.
The problem is when we next want to change.
At the moment Bitcoin is under threat from companies who want to use the 1MB limit to force people to use there competing technologies. They oppose change.

The scapegoats may even be the BRICs they’ll be dragged in too, hell they may be blamed for bringing down the global economy and your beloved free country will bring them in line with force and shove the new SDR down there throats. 
I’m a Bitcoin bull and sure it’s value will go up, but it isn’t going to be the world currency until after the One World Fiat collapses, and there is less than a 5% chance that it could be 3-50 years from now depending on how the SDR’s are managed.

Some guy was somewhat correct.
When you backup your wallet.dat file you are only backing up the existing addresses, if you create a new address in your wallet after backing it up it won't be in your backup.
So even if you have 10 BTC and only send 1 Bitcoin and get 9BTC in change the change goes to a new address, and it is possible that address is not backed up. 
Bitcoin Core has I think 200 predetermined change address to prevent this but Some Guy is correct in a way. (I know someone who lost 600BTC this way. 
There are what is now called an HD wallet seed and once backed up you backup all future address.

Many criticize the Bank for wanting to do this, but even Bitcoin developers are encouraging it.
Sidechains are a perfect eg. Banks can design their own blockchain peg it to Bitcoin and implement rules they find admirable like inflation. 
They are more likely to be part of the economic majority than us hard money advocates and Bitcoiners. So they can grow their network, and move value out of the Bitcoin blockchain.

in Monetarist economic theory, the velocity of money and the quantity of money are key to understanding price. (Google MV = PT)
you could in theory run the US economy on $1, it would have to change hands over a billion times a second, as everyone spent it real quick and if you had it it would be very valuable. in the absurd example above "V" would be High to compensate for "M" being low. 
in bitcoin we have:
the Money Supply, Quantity of Bitcoins "M" 
the Velocity how fast they move = in bitcoin the best measure we have is days destroyed, for "V"

It's an observation not an assertion.

I was just saying the fact that block discovery being slow is not relevant to the test, those conditions are typically.
My miners just happened to overheat so I took a small break.  ;-)
Anyway I think nullc should stop pushing the notion that he is consistent in his objection to the block size increase until such time as Blockstream is ready to implement it. It makes him sound disingenuous at best.
I'd rather he distilled his reasons into a format Joe can comprehend.
Unfortunately when I asked why I should take his position on trust, he responded, saying trust my judgment past, just ignore my comments that ripple is a decentralized solution.
A highly strange response, I was hoping to see some practical reason to dismiss Gavin's proposal.
The follow up was Gavin isn't involved anymore he hardly comments so he's not the leader anymore, implying it's one of them because they have a higher  contribution rate.

there are 2 types of SideChains. ones that happen on top of the protocol, these do not threaten Bitcoins incentive structure, they are good for the bitcoin ecosystem. 
SideChains that are dependent on SPV proofs run on the Bitcoin protocol level are a real threat.
Miners rewards diminish over time, ultimately the only revenue for miners is from transaction fees. if those transaction fees are generated on faster or more private SideChains for any reason at all, Bitcoin provides less incentive to miners to secure it.
in the case we have successful SideChains, value can be sucked out of Bitcoin, you can always exchange back for your Bitcoin but the network will lose its value because it isn't the main network.    
the developers know Bitcoin is the parent, and the SC is the child, but economic forces dont use the same rules as software.

you cant deny that the developers advocating for 1MB blocks don't own, or have employment or have invested interests in for profit companies or technologies that stand to benefit if the block size is not changed. 
I haven't seen a solution to scaling block size I like, but my view is the incentives in the protocol are sufficient to have the market regulate the size. so long as small blocks propagate faster than large blocks we will have a positive market outcome, there in is where development should be focused. 
sure we are not there yet, but there are no valid reasons just FUD preventing the increase in block size, *if it's so dangerous*, we could just switch back like the V8 to V7 block fork.

I think that’s the point it’s a value accounting system, in that the Bitcoin network is the equivalent of a global triple entry book keeping ledger.  (an un-trusted third party – the blockchain is all that is needed to stop the books from being crooked) 
Once a user enters the system by providing labor or property for a place in the system ,  it’s value is then a result of the network effect and supply and demand for a represented spot in the ledger. 
Still it doesn’t undermine the emergent market phenomenon that creates money,  it’s just a system to account for its transfer, that has real tangible value.

So nullc is consistent in his view "we shouldn't change block size", highlighting a track record that goes back beyond 2012 but with one caveat, sidechains must be ready to deploy before we increase the block size.
And if it becomes a problem before then we can just make my change that works with sidechains. 
That's hardly a fair approach when he dismisses all the concerns of the pro 20MB temporary measure proponents.
Hardly fitting of an employee who can't be evil.

I think some people overestimate the resilience of Bitcoin. 
The protocol servers the economic majority,  if we can protect it and keep it intact the economic majority may accept it and buy in. That's the end game I'm invested in.
The majority of contributing  developers are funded by well financed corporations with the sole purpose of changing the incentives that protect the protocol to allow them to exploit what so many see as infallible. 




“Bitcoin” the blockchain is conceptually independent from “bitcoin” the asset
The above was removed after their proposal was met with criticism, however 3 of the top 8 Bitcoin developers work for a company that believe they can do it by changing Bitcoin to allow the protocol to process sidechains.
Don't get me wrong I love the idea of using smart contracts to do this sort of thing just do it withing the existing protocol and incentive structure in the Bitcoin we already have.

The Bitcoin Price governs the amount of electricity used to generate a Bitcoin. the cost of production will on average be marginally less than the Bitcoin price.  This is a market function independent of Moore's Law.
Moors law is applicable, to the development of new mining technology, it is driven by competition creativity and innovation. This innovation determines who gets to make the best use of the total energy consumed in mining Bitcoin. We'll see heating applications when we shrink the chips down small enough. 
I envision innovation (Moore's Law) will continue still independent of price.

Satoshi implemented it at a time when block reward had little value and all transactions had no fees.
The distortion you're trying to prevent is caused by the fact that the network is subsidizing transaction to the tune of $5-$10 per transaction with monetary inflation.
The important point is that the fees are more expensive than the cost to store the transactions. The market will prevent unsolicited transactions in the future when the true cost is realized. 
The case now is centralized planning to prevent subsidized transactions from happening.  It's just a fact of economics that subsidies distort prices. 
It's not a long term threat given we know the subsidies will be cut in half ever 4 years. And we know miners are going to need economics of scale to supplement their income.

Agreed appealing to Satoshi is some what misleading. 
But he did create something and we all support his creation, on the merits of its utility, many blindly not understanding all the nuances, and from observation even some of the developers.  
Satoshi did note the Block size wasn't part of original offering, and as he commented, limiting it is not intended to be permanent. 
the 1MB'ers = "The sky will fall if we do this now."
the 1MB'ers = "Appeal to Authority" - even claim authority!

@_date: 2015-01-12 08:45:37
You are correct, but you need to think deeper. If lots of hashing power sits idle, because the reward has dropped, if miners can't earn anything else with there hashing power it is still more beneficial to cooperate than invest energy in attacking the network. This is a key in the Bitcoin incentives scheme. 
If transaction fees are earned on SideChains and Bitcoin's block reward is insignificant, miners have a new option, they can manipulate the flow of money, blocking transactions on Bitcoin or the SideChain, herding the market. The incentive to manipulate overwhelms the incentive to cooperate.

For profit companies want to solve the problem, restricting block size means you will most likely need to do off blockchain transactions and only centralized gate keepers can afford the fees, so people will use their services.
A good money is restricted in quantity not velocity. If we want good money we need to change.

The number of nodes is a mute point some small block proponents say nodes are irrelevant, as they just follow the blockchain as agreed by the miners.
Some say if you project the decline it will coalesce into a centrally controlled super node.
The reality is so long as there are  competing interest between nodes they will remain independent and decentralized even if there is just one per state. Consolidation is expected it's not practical for everyone to have a node. Just interests with an need for blockchain will have a node.
Large blocks have a higher orphan risk miners have an incentive to make small blocks to optimize propagation time and reduce orphan risk. They also have an incentive to maximize fees. 
The technology available in the network will provided physical limits, miners will optimize size to maximize profit between the above incentives (size and transactions) the fee market will be driven by supply and demand.

Yip my concern is the economic majority have beliefs in ideas like inflation is good. New Bitcoin blockchains (side chains) can have rules more appealing to the current economic elite, it would be easy to swallow Bitcoin with an artificial market demand for SideChain BTC most will sell out, and we'll be left with an empty shell.
But the real issue is miners are disenfranchised with reducing rewards in Bitcoin. Side Chains over time will offer them better lone term rewards and so there incentives will shift.

There's over 200 pages discussing the economic ramifications over on Bitcoin talk dating back to October 27th. 




“Bitcoin” the blockchain is conceptually independent from “bitcoin” the asset
Bitcoin mining rewards diminish over time, and will be supplemented by transaction fees. Decentralized SideChains that generate transaction fees for miners will allow miners to attack one chain even Bitcoin's blockchain and earn BTC while doing so.
That's a negative change to the existing Bitcoin incentive scheme, that the majority of the community support, I see a lot of wealth leaving Bitcoin for the simple reason that a fact, the blockchain and Bitcoin are inseparable, will not be true once the protocol has been changed as proposed by BlockStream.

You are half correct a 2MB block is not a solution but an unlimited block size is. 
The most cost effective and practical way to prevent this attack is to take the fee and write the transaction to the blockchain.  for 6TB this spam attack would cost a node about $0.0015 to store those transactions, and the spammer about $20,000 in fees to execute the attack.
It's just the limited block size that prevents the solution and makes the attack possible.

there are less than 15,000 people with over 100BTC,

when Bitcoin is going up and people want to have some surety, i think we will see an increase in nodes.

the option to mine has other benefits, provided your electricity costs are the lowest (I believe they are in the zone) mining will be more profitable for you than the world. So you have a better hedge against volatility.

SW does not seem to be a cost benefit when it comes to network bandwidth, it has a net benefit only on the storage space* needed to store a block.
*it's worth noting that the storage cost of the blockchain is the most insignificant cost in the bitcoin network ($300 = 6TB of block space)
It's also worth noting that this resources is donated by those who have an invested interest in the integrity of the data.
It's often said the cost of HD space puts centralizing pressure on nodes but it's insignificant if you actually look at the costs.
The most valuable resources is actually bandwidth, and SW optimizes storage cost at the expense of bandwidth.

As Bitcoin is today miners get BTC by securing the Bitcoin Blockchain with there hashing power.  (Not all SideChains will be bad but as proposed they will destroyed Bitcoin over time.)
Today if one uses that hashing power against Bitcoin one would have to give up the Bitcoin income. 
This incentive ensures cooperation is more profitable than non-cooperation.
With SideChains Bitcoin can move to another blockchain, miners can merge mine it and earn transaction fees. (In principal they earn Bitcoin or something that can be converted to Bitcoin guaranteed by the protocol.
Bitcoin block reward diminishes over time in 6-10 years it is very likely transaction fees will be the greater part of a block reward.
If miners earn BTC equivalent on a SideChain, they have a new economic option - non-cooperation . They can earn Bitcoin by mining transaction fees on a SideChain, and use that same hashing power to attack the Bitcoin blockchain.  This is new not possible in Bitcoin today.
The reverse is also true in the above.
Say 2 states each adopt a SideChain convertible 1:1 to BTC, (or a SideChain is used for something like SilkRoad) after some time a conflict arise and a state sponsored declaration is passed making it legal to attack the other SideChain. Miners could both attack the Bitcoin network or a SideChain, and earn while doing it. 
This change will change the nature of Bitcoin

Ftfu What this means is miners can control the flow in and out by mining empty blocks locking the market in or out of the SideChain or Bitcoin in conjunction with other events accumulate and convert after the fact. In effect miners have new powers and can manipulate the market.

0 fees give an incentive to use bitcoin a fraction of cent gives an incentive to limit the number of useless transaction. Together they act to optimize growth of the network.
Actually satoshi recommended a 0.01BTC fee to mitigate spam (at the time 1BTC was less than $0.07)
The cost to write a block was about ~$3.50 the concern was not transaction spam but that it could cost less than $500 a day to write 32MB blocks to the blockchain 24/7 thus destroying the network.
the same attack today would cost around $1.4M a day. So it's not a threat. 
The block limit served it's purpose satoshi predicted it could be removed around March of 2011 bitcoin happened to be trading at about $1 per BTC at the time.

SideChains incentivises the additional mining of SideChains.
In Bitcoin 1.0 you can't earn Bitcoin while attacking the network with your mining power. Bitcoin with merge mined SideChains is not the same you can mine, earn Bitcoin and attack the Bitcoin blockchain with the same hashing power.
There is a fundamental change in the incentives regardless of how likely you think it is. 
Don't assume Bitcoin won't grow, and don't assume all governments will cooperate all the time, it'll just take the stroke of a pen to stop transaction in and out of SideChains.
First to be manipulated will be the ones that offer anonymity, just watch miners attack SR SideChain for profit, capitalizing on market panic.

Yip that's enough. Just imagine SR coin under attack for a short while people dump it an the exchange well below the 1:1 peg manipulators pick it up cheap, and convert back to BTC at 1:1 afterwards.
This situation doesn't even require deviant behavior, same would happen in a state sanctioned trade disputes. If you think giving control of Bitcoin over to the miners and the banking cartels that will control them yes SideChains are the way to go.

I define spam as an unsolicited transaction.
I don't however feel it's appropriate to define the use of money in that way.
So long as the fee market is distorted with a subsidy you're going to see otherwise non viable transactions. (We pay between $5-$10 in monetary inflation to subsidized transaction costs)
And so long there is no centralized authority who's going to say which transaction are valid and which aren't?
one mans spam is another mans income. I'm OK so long as there is an incentive to reduce the ability to fill up block space with free transactions and that criteria is met when you charge a fraction of a cent.
If we increased the block size the amount we pay per transaction subsidy would drop we should be optimizing block size for a $0.05 fee subsidy. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 16:33:12
How much did it cost? I herd report of $10 to $20,000 in fees. The point being the cost to attack the network is orders of magnitude more expensive than defending it.

Money is memory, the blockchain is the value ledger. It's only stores the wealth one is willing to exchange in order to use it.
Mining is the process by which the immutable ledger is maintained, and percentages are reallocated according the wealth exchange by using the ledger.
If 1BTC (1, 13 millionth of the ledger) is worth $350 then it would be economically viable to spend $349 to accumulated that 1 BTC.
the network emission scheme only allows 25 new bitcoin every 10 minutes to those who protect the network.
So the higher the value the more real world wealthy is invested to protect it.
If the value dropped to $1 then the wealth needed to protect a $13m network would equal the mining reward.
The cost to savage the network will be higher than cooperating given the incentive structure so it's safe to say the Proof of Work is optimal for the value of Bitcoin.
Over time the dynamic changes with diminishing rewards, think about it for long enough it becomes amazing to realize how well balanced the system is.

Sure it's hard to increase the block size most of the opposition is coming from developers with invested interest in technologies that would benefit from keeping it the way it is.
I'm pro 2wp using smart contracts and trusted 3rd party/s but doing a 2wp that is managed by the Bitcoin protocol is not the way to do it.
As for Blockstream and sidechains they have a checkmate position, well almost they have said they can implemented an SPV proof allowing the 2wp in the Bitcoin protocol using a soft fork. Meaning only miners need to make the change not the nodes.
This change the mining incentives, Blockstream can incentives miners to make the change to earn new revenue to merge mine sidechains.

I'm not in favor of artificially limiting block space to increase mining revenue at the expense of adoption while fees are being subsidized by holders. 
Larger blocks come with an increased orphan risk, enough for a healthy free market for block space to form.


My opinion of Mike is not relevant. It's the fact that the protocol is centrally controlled to force an artificial fee market while users subsidies fees that is the problem.

I think that estimate of 98% of the cost being hardware is wrong. It may be that 98% of the cost is hardware but most of that cost is someone's profit, over time it begs for competition. 
at this time my 3rd Gen ASICs are still mining profitably the hardware cost was recovered over a year ago. It's just the variable costs that count. Hardware costs are sunk costs good or bad. But the ability to mine profitably for the network is not dependant on the hardware cost. Hardware costs are relative to a miners risk and profit.
Still I agree we'll trend to the inevitable outcome where fees are higher than they are today. It's just not reasonable to try and force that outcome while we are in the growth stage and subsidizing the processing of transactions.
To add to that the cost of storing and relaying the transaction it is paid by nodes the benefit nodes receive in return is a universal agreed ledger. 
Nodes remain decentralized so long as the benefit of participatimg in a functional economy is cheaper than running a node.
realistically most small corporations will have an incentive to run a node should the bitcoin economy grow.

the other camp follows bitcoin' they are not forcing change - they are just wasting for more people to adopt user adjustable block size, so the 1MB limit can be removed safely.  
this proposal would prove the BU adjustable block size set by the nodes can dictate to mines what's acceptable and what's not.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:08:35
some rules will never change - but you don't just simply add new ones either. if the 1MB soft fork rule tells us anything we should take 5-10 years discussing the consequences of rule changes because soft fork rules can have very large ramifications down the line.

No the attacker doesn't have to pay anything if blocks are full. the attack is successful just because it bloats the mempool.
 per 6TB HD the cost of this attack is $0.0015 per node while the cost to execute the attack cost thousands of dollars.
The attack was only successful because of the limited block size. With an unlimited block size and cheaper fees the cost of the attack would not favor the attacker and would have little to no impact on the network.

There are no transactions that should be subject to centralised control. Unsolicited transactions that don't pay a fee could be defined as spam but it's up to the each individual node to decide not the relay the transaction and it's up to each miners to not process the transaction.  
you'rer challenging the function of money. the best way to prevent this attack is to take the fee and write the transaction to the blockchain.  = 6TB this spam attack would cost a node about $0.10 to store those transactions, and the spammer about $20,000 to execute the attack. 
it's just the limited block size that prevents the solution.

In giving up the right to your creations you are in the same category as employees who don't have that right. But the sad thing is, while employees rights are degraded they have supplemental ones like severance and paid leave, something contractors don't have.
Peters patent idea preserve that right and you get to asses the value of your creation after you do it and you get a bonus if it is valuable and your client has to agree or disagree on the value.

If you want historical understanding - Nodes are Miners - they were are one and the same in the design - relay nodes did not exist. When people started using relay nodes - i.e. what we call full nodes today - the design of bitcoin was not affected.
You are confusing Nodes and Miners.  The only Nodes that exist in the bitcoin ecosystem are the mining Nodes. the other nodes, *relay nodes*, you call "agents" are redundant.

I haven't looked at BIP109.
But I do think the limiting of the transaction size is important.
I think a free market mechanism to limited transaction size is the best way to limit. One where nodes can give relay preferences to transactions above a limit provided they meet a set of criteria. an influential one being an above average fee relative to size as determined by the cost per space in a recent block.
The other mechanism would be for miners to set a non linear fee structure for transaction size where larger transactions can be appropriately charged for any risk or burden that the miner feels necessary prior to adding it to their mempool.

segwit to me looks just like an inter operable sidechain integrated into bitcoin. it enables lots of unpredictable behaviors, not all of then positive for the network, as does P2SH.

Unlike Core - BU has many professionals (not developers) who have diverse experiences a proven bitcoin discussion identity voice opinion and vote.

if you analyse them and they are not valid. But one core is capable of more parallel programming hoers, - if Core wen't so hostile they could work with BU to remove the 1MB soft fork block limit.
BU makes just highlights an option that was always available to anyone on the bitcoin network and that is to set their own block size limit.

When transaction fees cost more than running a node the node count will drop.
Bitcoin need to be widely distributed to encourage node adoption. Also if miners limit block size in time users have no reason to run a nods.
You do understand that the 1MB limit was to stop 32MB blocks being written to the blockchain when it cost $1. Today it costs over $15000 in lost income to write a block and to write a large one that's likely to be rejected is it's own deterrent.
The  incentives design works it was debatable when it cost $1 to write a block.

you not being objective. 
Mathematically it's proven while inflation is non zero. So in a 123 years the mathematical model is no longer valid. if that a concern? - if it is add a block limit to start when inflation is zero.
however there the is a practical block limit and a fee market will emerge - we know it works, we don't need centralized block limit interventions and FUD about removing it.

;-) that's correct u/pb1x, the incentives for the consensus rules like the 21M cap and no double spends are strengthened with adoption and the use of on chain transactions. - they called consensus rules for a reason. 
rules like the 1MB limit are diminished with growth, they are not strengthened with adoption, but degraded.
they can only be enforced by centralized control of the code - the way these economic actors remove the 1MB limit is by the code they chose to run. like BU, and Core when they make block size user configurable. 


this is a valid pertinent and technical question that should be answered by all Core developers.

If that's what it takes to keep money honest then yes do it.
Don't be irrationality afraid. It's not the storage cost that is concerning, it's the processing cost, the bandwidth and transaction cost to validate the transaction.
Looking at this through the eyes of ludwig von mises and hayek, it's not what the money is used for that's important, but how the money works.
People are not always going to use it inefficiently, at the moment bitcoin transaction security costs are being subsidized by the users.
Subsidies always distort free markets. The inflation subsidy we give to miners every 10 minute is halved every 4 years. This subsidy is designed to secure transactions while the network is small and growing. The free market will find an equilibrium, it's not a bug in the design and bitcoin is not broken just because the subsidy distorts transaction costs.
What's wrong is to force a fee market at this stage of bitcoins growt.

I disagree with that idea - not the personality. He has uncovered many scams and saved people I guess hundreds of thousands of dollars - hes wrong to discoreging investment in bitcoin - but he does it because of his economic belief in mild inflation is good. 
insulting is not helping bitcoin evolve. FYI started interacting with jstolfi in 2013 on bitcointalk.org I offed him 1BTC at the time to test it out. he refused saying he wanted to stay impartial and I paraphrase he compared it to taking heroin while studying the people using it.

If bitcoin was only ever used to pay for coffee as a user case it would be considered a huge success. The use of coffee to belittle and trivialize block space is abhorrent.
The truth is using bitcoin for trivial uses will naturally become uneconomical. We don't need a centralized group of developed who are economically ignorant to try steer the ship.
Coffee on the other hand is a global commodity with over a $30,000,000,000 a years trade volume that supports an estimated 7,000,000 un banked. So yes just pennies per retail coffee filter through to that industry but it's a an economy and it's viable. And the developers are ignorant of it, thinking it's just a trivial unimportant and wasteful use or real money and hard drive space that is ever decreasing in cost according to Moores Law.
The market will restricted block size at the limits of technology. We don't need a centralized group of select crony developers to do it!

that's u/jonny1000 wed dream - the Nash equilibrium ensures this will never happen - there is more incentive to mine empty blocks for ever. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:41:48
AD - is Acceptance Depth - it's a setting to ensure nodes follow the longest honest chain while still signaling a preference for the block size they are willing to relay. 
Why would miners show a preference for AD - either a block propagates through the network and is valid or it doesn't, miners mine on top of valid blocks they don't reject blocks because they are too big, they risk being orphaned if they don's extend the chain tip. 
Blocks that are too big are orphaned because they take too long to propagate or validate, and if they are accepted miners mine empty blocks on top of them until they are secure, thus creating a technical limit for max block size accepted by miners and a resulting transaction fee market? 
With parallel block validation, why would a miner mine on top of 1GB block full of the most computationally intensive transactions that takes a little over one day to validate?
also 
with Xthin all transactions are already propagated, any block that has nu-propagated transactions risks being orphaned? why do you think the wrong chain will be built on? 
But the more pressing question is, is there an incentive to do this type of behavior what is the expected benefit?

its not a radical change - the bitcoin network is not threatened by developers of individuals who deviate from the honest chain. 
anyone can do a double spend, on there own fork, or adjust the code to issue 100btc per block, but they will find themselves excommunicated if they do. 
user adjustable block limit is not a consensus rule that gets you excommunicated from the network, it just allows a node to follow the network if and when bigger blocks come along.

You forget consensus rules are used to define valid transactions, the block size limit is an arbitrary rule.


@_date: 2017-03-19 04:21:16
yes. not left out or hidden - read the paper - valid blocks are the ones filled with honest transactions not limited to 1MB. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:22:03
the 1MB block limit is a fundamental of the small block proponents position.
if you prefer you can substitute 1MB limit with 1.7MB (or 2.1) block weight, There is a difference between block weight and block limit - segwit is a desirable option because it preserves the historical 1MB limit while switching to block weight. 
if you don't understand that ask one of the developers to explain it to you.

1MB blocks limit transactions to about 3tx/s we are at capacity now. 
we have the IRS - ask the biggest exchange in the US for all bitcoin addresses linked to the names of all their 
customers - some 6,000,000 people registered with Coinbase. 
Coinbade and every exchange in the world is required to collect that KYC info. 
The US and every other G20 nation share information to reduce tax evasion and money laundering. 
it's only a matter of time until every transaction is linked to every user in a centralized database tracking the 3tx/s per second in real time.   
the upgrade to bitcoin that would make that more difficult is if the number of users grew and interacted directly and the number of transactions they make grew.
the conclusion I draw is bigger blocks keep bitcoin more decentralized, who wants KYC AML laws to track your every move on a limited blockchain.   
small block proponents seem to overlook this most pressing centralized control of end users, when leveraging centralized control of the block limit to decentralize bitcoin control of nodes at the cost of centralizing end user monitoring.

How so? the cost of running a node today doesn't increase if you adjust the block limit to 8MB and in 4 years time when we hit the 8MB the cost will be the same. 
The real hardware cost to running a node is the increasing UTXO, the real variable cost is bandwidth. BU uses less bandwidth than segwit and facilitates more transactions for the same bandwidth. 
so if the overall cost of running a node is measured as transaction capacity I believe you are mistaken, BU is more cost effective. 
BU is not an binary option, we can still have all the innovation developed by other implementations and bigger blocks. bigger blocks are the foundation for future growth and innovation.

exit points can be tracked - when they engage with legacy systems, however with growth the you the need to touch legacy systems diminishes when you aquifer and spend bitcoin. but yes for better or worse bitcoin is what it is.

it's a fork of Core just with a user configurable block size limit. The objection is decentralized control of the block limit, not the quality of the code.  
if the 100+ developers supported a user configurable block size limit, would that change your mind? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:40:25
Your advocating a totally different design to bitcoin.
if the network with such a system grew big, and we had a 2.5% fee then 2.5% of GDP would be wasted on energy mining the network.
Satoshi designed the transaction cost to be based on a marginal cost of production. PoW
**PS - we have about a 95% fee subsidy at the moment.**
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:57:42
I'm more than a user. In fact I don't use there code. I'm an investor in the network - the incentive protocol not the code. 
I have very little knowledge of the code - when the developers tell me it does XYZ I trust them implicitly as I can't read code.
I believe the code in segwit does what the developers say it does and is 100% bug free now and always. I have no question its good quality code.  
Why I can't accept segwit is not because of the technical code, but because it changes the economic incentives that make bitcoin secure. 
I would like an economic impact study or some one to answer my economic questions. - what is even less acceptable is deleting all the question people ask and the answers people give, and holding conferences where people are not aloud to ask questions unless they are about segwit code. 
Developers are not good economists, mathematicians, sociologists, incentive designers, computer scientists - they write code they are programmers - they should not be directing changing the incentive architecture satoshi designed.

Blockstream does the same. I don't claim everything you do is evil (a subjective criteria to which you hold yourself accountable) but there are economic concerns with sidechains and the proposed changes to the protocol incentives are not good I considered them evil. 
Yet instead of address them you ignore them and refuse put them to rest by conducting a peer review economic impact study.

"[replay protection](  by any other name is "transaction incompatibility" with the existing bitcoin network. 
While BU can implement such a feature - the ultimate control of the protocol resides with the bitcoin users who run BU,  so replay protection would be a user activated setting according to BU founding principals, given the user the option to activate it or not (the decentralized governing principle of BU). 
As Core has a top down control and governance model they would be able to implement such a feature and push it to the network.

that is what BU is. 


that's not totally true. developers have no power in bitcoin - users chose code that upholds the incentives that preserve the network that stores their wealth. Developers in Bitcoin are subservient to Miners - Developers have to use lobbyists and political posturing to get miners and users to run their code. (bitcoin consensus is apolitical the process used to get people to choose code is political) 


that's not totally true, either. in just over 8 years there have been just over 400 developers, the vast majority have opted to leave and most experienced the ones who have over 7 years of experience have all been expelled, the remaining that is a little over 100, the vast majority, some 80+ do stuff like QC, write text files, correct punctuation, leaving less than 20 who write code, and less than 10 who actually decide who's code gets pulled.
so we have decentralized development and centralized controls. 
The last developer to have his administration privileges revoked was recently was Jeff Garzik, he was removed because he supported increasing the block size - the process used to decide if he should be on the team was highly centralized and political - so the longest standing Bitcoin Core GitHub administrator had his privileges revoked over political infighting. pathetic. 
Befor that Gavin with 8 years of experiences managing the bitcoin GitHub was removed because he wrote this:  
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:03:10
this is the reason miners will always need the support of the people who buy their coins, and want to remove the limit - the subsidy is going to shrink and they need to grow users now while the subsidy is deflating the price. they are not running BU to take over the network as some crazy people believe.

Hostile - no. BU is a fork of Core just with a user configurable block size limit. The objective is decentralized control of the block limit, not the quality of the code or when it activates, or the artificial  incentive to fork and destroy bitcoin.

Miners have an incentive to adhere to the consensus rules to keep transaction honest, that same incentive is why they keep improving the bitcoin network. they don't have an incentive to limit transactions, the soft fork block limit is weekend with growth not strengthened, its part of the transport layer - not a consensus rule. 
Where is the incentive for the 30% of BU miners to take the $600,000 a day they earn and throw it down the drain? - you can't win by killing the network. Miners can't win by making a block size bigger than the network will accept.

that's not true - I can back up any claim I make. 


quoting and understanding are not the same thing, that's just one of many reasons it's safe to upgrade. most small block proponents use that quote as if it is a valid reason to limit block space. that's not an objective response. if you did not intend that my apologies. 


there is no evidence to suggest the reduction of block rewards will will self destruct bitcoin in the future! - that is a baseless claim with no evidence to back it up, it applies equally to a 1MB block limit as it does to a 32MB block limit or no limit at all. 


that's another baseless claim, you just linked to Peters talk that proves it - BU advocated for a market derived limit. - a technical limit will emerge, as the bigger blocks get the higher the orphan cost, whether the limit is 1MB or 100MB a limit is inevitable. You can't prove it creates fee pressure if inflation is zero using Peters model, but we can use basic supply and demand economics to conclude that a fee market will emerge if there is a limit. you can't dismiss occam's razor.

Increasing the block limit has been discussed for 6 years or more, the pros and cons are well understood the risks can be managed. 
BU just decentralized block size decision making, why is that irresponsible? which centralized authority should take responsibility for the increase?  - BU supporters don't seem impatient to me, it's been 6 years, what's another 2. 
Segwit as code, was only recently released, it would be prudent to discuss it over time much like we have the block size increase for 6 or more years before we activate it.

Yes it's a centralized service that's only useful if every miner uses it. Being OSS doesn't make it safer. A copy of the code and hardware doesn't create competition.  So it's not a logical argument.
The centralized service could disadvantage 10% of users and still be the dominant service.

I like your idea of the 2wp, it's great, I'm just opposed to the idea of modifying the Bitcoin protocol to manage the swap in a trustless way as part of the PoW.
We always need to trust those we give money too, we should not have to trust the money. We should use smart contracts to manage the exchange and the money. 
It's wrong to ask the money to manage itself. Sidechains use miners to manage the 2wp, and that's wrong, it will change the incentives that make Bitcoin good money.
You won't take my word for it so I suggest you go re-read the gold collapsing Bitcoin up thread from the day the Blockstream paper was first released, list all the objections and then commission a peer reviewed study on the topics.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:54:29
I can't have an honest debate if you are debating a position I don't hold.
This debate is not about increasing block-size it's about who is in control of the block size limit!

satoshi described the consensus mechanism in section 11 of the white paper, BU "emergent consensus" is a name given and an extension of to the resulting consensus described in the bitocin white paper, we have 8 years of empirical data to suggest it works.
Why do you say it's new?  
whiteout an explanation I can only assume you are fear mongering. Bitcoin is open source anyone can change the block limit, its not protected or forbidden by a centralized authority. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:45:24
:-) no, Segwit is the first step in a master plan to move fee paying transaction off the bitcoin blockchain and onto a new network like the Lightening Network.
Who is going to secure the Bitcoin network as limited block space drives bitcoin uses and fees onto Layer 2 networks? 
We need to increase the block size first - so bitcoin can compete and grow in a free market, not subsidize layer 2 growth.

@_date: 2015-05-07 14:36:06
Missing from your understand is the nodes also validate the blocks and are keepers of the chain.
The size of the block allowed is determined by the protocol, and the miners have little say in that, or as much say as you and me given the situation today. 
For Bitcoin to scale the situation must never change, and there are many for profit interests looking to change that and to manipulate the situation.
Gavin's 20Mb proposal just buys us more time to protect Bitcoin for us the people.

@_date: 2017-03-14 21:19:06




relay nodes (not mining) not relaying blocks is not the same as mining nodes - using discouraged blocks. - there is a financial incentive to not discouraged blocks, but if a block takes longer then 8 minutes to validate it should become a discouraged block, no change in game theory. same old bitcoin - relay nodes just have more power with BU.

BU miners earn over $600,000 a day, they are invested in bitcoin. they are dependent on Bitcoin - segwit designers are not as invested, they are making layer 2 networks, they don't care about the miners - in fact they fighting agained them at the moment - developers want to strip them of their incentives to secure bitcoin blockchain transactions. 
Many Core Developers are invested in moving fee paying transactions onto the the Lightening Network, away from miners. they're investors will secure the LN network with hubs that relay transactions for a fee that fee will not go to miners.

Satoshi felt it should be solely up to individuals not left to the influence of developers.

@_date: 2017-03-16 23:59:06
I'm not quoting anyone to fit my addenda, I'm describing the design, and quoting the designer.  


 
fits perfectly well with no block size limit. - There is a natural transaction limit, - so long as information can't be communicated faster then the speed of light, a fee market for bitcoin transactions will exist. - try twist the design intent to fit your new addenda - it looks more and more like an alt? 


such a ludicrous statement it needs to be backed up - it's the opposite and repeating a lie enough times wont make it fact. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:07:42


that's not how fact bases discussions work. if you cant prove your point you have to conced you may be wrong, the same rules apply to me. 
I have one question and you refuse to answer it. 
**What technical arguments support keeping a block size limit?**
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:08:15
I lol, opt-in replacement worked somehow making you relevant, a 1MB block limit is not a magic number you realize 1.1MB blocks don't work for relay quite egotistical reasons. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:16:05
the fee market is a small block argument, bigger blocks reduce the fee pressure, not all miners are supporting the idea, but they are enjoying the profits, 
Those profits come at a cost though, higher transaction fees increase friction and slow distribution of coins and as a result bitcoin growth, and that affects their long term profitability. 
I'm hoping the BU miners get more support and fix this situation.  
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:44:47
It's not trolling? you asked how transactions are moved off the bitcoin blockchain and I explained it to you. 
There is a difference between the bitcoin protocol executing a multisig or payment channel, and a third party executing it. 
before P2SH the bitcoin protocol did not process the P2SH script, some independent 3rd party did, the miners just processed the output text. today the miners process the script - along with the extra CPU workload and orphan risk.   
It's all about risk! P2SH takes the risk out of the economy and away from having to trust a 3rd party, and distributes it over the network using a "free resource" mining, only its not free the network pays for it and distributes the risk, but not everyone in the network benefits (eg. mega banks using P2SH will benefit greatly while everyday bitcoin users won't, but everyday users pay a higher price than the minority who benefit)  - it's a socialized cost, that benefits a few. It's insignificant while it's not widely adopted and the security is heavily subsidized but in 20-30 years time security is not so heavily subsidized and P2SH is widely used the risk profile changes as we move in that direction,and along with that the incentives. 
Failure in that situation is not a bug in bitcoin's design but a result of a lack of understanding on the part of the developers, and misplaced trust in those developers. 
Bitcoin used as money should secure and make sure the money is trusted. (no more no less - if we do that bitcoin will take over the world) economic activity and risk should stay in the economy, P2SH allows some of those functions to move onto the bitcoin network and that has consequences not all of them positive.  
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:45:06


maybe they did it off the blochchain as third party as I described, that's the correct way to do it. 
I remember the fuss at the time it was important - without any evidence to support your claim I believe you are mistaken.  
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:55:38
you are mistaken, who decides what gets pulled on git hub? 
**a small group of *incumbent developers***
They may believe they are decentralized because they used a decentralized development process that allows anyone to contribute, but the methods used to decide what gets pulled is very centralized process, only a very few insiders participate in that process, it's typical of centralized control. 
It's like the FED, only the FED it more decentralized than Core because there are more people participating in centralized decision making.  
;-) Tough luck if you are not one of the incumbent developer.

@_date: 2017-03-14 21:49:15


people say this but there is no evidences to back it up, this argument does not stand up to criticism. 


this is very true, however the limit is not determined by 10 Core developers or a centralized authority, it's a technical limit that the network is capable of maintaining - its enforced by blocks becoming orphaned if they take too long to propagate the network. - so size does matter.  
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:17:23
Jevons paradox. is very relevant but it does not support your argument like you think it does.  
The industrial revolution depended on the falling cost of energy, that resulted in a shift of power away from serfdom.
As data becomes cheaper, it becomes cheaper to be your own bank (bitcoin) with more people we'll see more banks (bitcoin adoption)
LN is a banking layer on top of bitcoin, [80% of the worlds population live on less than $10 per day.]( today if LN was available $1.12 average BTC transaction cost - it would cost $2.24 to open and close a LN channel. while $2.24 for a cup of coffee is a first world problem, it's a lot of money for the vast majority of humanity. - they couldn't afford to use LN - but for sure I would want $2.00 of bitcoin bought by some 5,000,000,000 every year as a savings tool. - Bitcoin is not just a schema for the richest 10% - it's sound money for a global economy. 
Yes the cheaper data storage become the more we use.  [by 2020 there it's predicted 5,200 GB of data for every man, woman and child on Earth]( that's not a argument to limit the bitcoin block size. bandwidth and storage have a limit - and bitcoin is designed so we don't crash into it when we remove the 1MB soft fork limit.

It's hand full of incumbent developers who support decentralized development but reserve the right to control what gets accepted into the Bitcoin reference client, those in the group who have different perspectives are not calibrated but expelled. 
The white paper and the history of bitcoin spells out who is in control of enforcing rules - developers have no say - Just those doing the PoW. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:00:57


They have never been in control and never should be, it's not part of the bitcoin design. 


If Core agree to a hard fork - they will lose control. - their position of power is dependent on the fact that bitcoin can't hard fork. (going so far as to insist bitcoin has never had a hard forked.)
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:30:14
LOL I couldn't be more Anarcho-capitalism if I wanted to be.
social good and socialism are not the same thing, Bitcoin is a social good not socialism - Nazisim arose out of socialism, as a centralized control of "a fare and just system" for social good - I'm seeing some parallels with the "we know better attitude" materialize among some "bitcoin elitists" in bitcoin.   
Anarcho-capitalism for social good is what I'm advocating - not centralized control of code for elitists.

Satoshi  has left us written record of how bitcoin was designed to work and resolve conflicts, lets not abandon it now, there is an apolitical process that the developers are abandoning. 
 **white paper section 5**
















**satoshi white paper section 12**




-Satoshi Nakamoto
this is not the argument:


1.7MB is a limit transaction limits destroys bitcoin, bitcoin - but the real problem is segwit limits on chain capacity in favor of off chain capacity, moving fee paying transactions off the blockchain degrades bitcoin security over time.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:44:41


that's the elegant thing about BU - it's not forcing the issue - it's being prepared for it. 


what is that belief founded on? I believe very large blocks and a limited block size both lead to centralization yet I'm pro moving the limit. 


no one can give me a definition for decentralization, **not any cost,** we can't sacrifice on centralized control of nodes to maximizing geographic decentralization - that's what we have now, there are lots of hols in this idea that nodes centralize in data centers if we move the block limit. 
 
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:59:36


No, I made the argument - read my post again. 


that's not why the mine empty blocks. miners mine empty blocks because they can't fully validate the block that came before it, it happens whn you get lucky and find a block within a very short time of rescinding the previous block. By mining an empty block they are guaranteed their new block is not orphaned. if they include transactions from the previous block they will most likely be orphaned, so if they find a block they propagate it, and when they are able to validate it the carry on including transactions.
In the absence of a block limit, this natural behavior would serve as a capacity limit and encourage a fee market when blocks become too big or take too long to validate. much like a rev limiter on an engine. fee pressure builds if the transaction loaded is too big to process all at once - further negating the notion of a tragedy of the commons.

@_date: 2017-03-10 21:17:51
I know about it I think I was the first to call it the jonny1000 attack, it's not a vulnerability, he's creating FUD. 
far from willfully ignorant, I'm very skeptical, I need evidence to to drive my discussion, I was no fan of BU for similar reasons, BU and Core are on the same side of the fence - they both believe nodes enforce the limit. 
But it's still within the realm of default behavior and the overriding incentive design of bitcoin - BU won't result in a chain split, jonny1000 has elaborately constructed a scenario that has almost no probability of of materializing, there is more chance that 100% of the network agrees to adopt BU in the next 30 days than there is a chance of a split happening in the next 100 years.

 I suspect some chalets may stay open months but who knows, and people will have many channels open at once. 
How frequently do you suspect people to open and close a channel when bitcoin is at 1,000,000,000 users I was being conservative?
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:12:43
It is active it's working just the way bitcoin has always worked, and BU is working the way it's advertised to work. 
it's not a change - it's same old bitcoin with user adjustable soft fork block limit. 
if everyone made the soft fork 1MB limit adjustable and agreed to follow the longest chain we could avoid hard forking and just move forward. The problem is not activation, it's that most of the network wants a 1MB limit for now.
what needs to change is the will to support for the 1MB limit, and unlike the consensus rules the 1MB limit degrades as the network grows, while the 21M cap and no double spends gets stronger with growth. 
it's just time. 
the transactions on the blockchain pre the 1MB soft fork use the same consensus rules and are as valid now as they were when there was no limit. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:10:42
it was relatively true, I illustrated why in my reply.  


**Do you support centralized control, or decentralized control?**
multiple implementations is decentralized, (resilient) 
a single implementation controlled by 100 people is centralized. (single point of failure) 


please explain: 
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:01:24
how is it a change? anyone has always been able to compile and set their own limit, BU just made it user configurable eliminating the need to be a developer. this option has always been present, it is not new. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:20:34


feature not a bug - by what authority should an activation threshold be set. 
- all issues are surmountable, the FUD about EB attack malicious - bitcoin developers can address them, they are secondary to the fact that some are opposing use adjustable block size limit, or removing the block size limit. 


I can't get over the level of malice, this is very far from the truth, you are not cooperating to make bitcoin better you are attacking over 30% of the horsepower that is preserving bitcoin security.

That's an insulting generalization if you want my perspective on fee here it is: 
I'm not pushing the propaganda that we need to adopt segwit to reduce fees, I don't know what fees should be, but I do know they are heavenly subsidized and if the 80% of the worlds who live on less than $10 per day can't afford to use bitcoin and buy a $3 bitcoin investment bitcoin is just going to be a toy for the elites.  
One just needs too extrapolate fee growth in a liner chart and pick the point when most users abandon bitcoin, that's how the fee market ends - at the $1.5 we're excluding over 80% of the world.
***Now and for the practical future fees are largely irrelevant to scaling bitcoin infrustructure,** it's about increasing the network of users. I agree some mandatory fee is necessary in the case the network is being abused with spam but it need not be greater than $0.005 for fresh transactions to be effective.
Bitcoin has an inflation subsidy given to miners to lubricate cooperation between network participants thus creating and giving the bitcoin network value.
The subsidy comes from the inflation of the money supply paid by all those invested in bitcoin's success, it is a tax that subsidized security and writing of transactions to the blockchain.
At the moment the cost per transaction is over 95% subsidized. bother sides of this debate are focusing on the fee per transaction as if it's too cheep or too expensive, that's not an issue today or in the practical future, nor is the networks under threat of huge blocks that can only be processed by data-centers.
Looking at manipulating fees now is ludicrous and incredibly shortsighted, especially using fee pressure, created by limited block space, to justify a fee market.
How can any rational person look at &lt;5% of the bitcoin transaction cost and come to a definitive conclusion about what the total fee should be. Whatever method is used it will be wrong given the subsidy is decreasing by 50% every 4 years. An instant 50% increase in cost is sure to disrupt an existing supply and demand equilibrium in a free market no mater how predictable it is due to limited knowledge of every market participants future fee tolerance.
**If fees were an order of magnitude cheaper or more expensive they would still be largely irrelevant and most notably distorted by the subsidy. How can a free market determine a value for a service when the service is &gt;96% subsidized.**
BS/Core Fundamentalists are being incredibly irresponsible by enforcing a fee market by limiting block size now as it affects distribution and big and small block proponents are being naive complaining about the transaction cost when the fee paid is +-&lt;5% of the subsidized cost. and then encouraging lower fees if you move transactions out of the blockchain. - some one buying $1 in bitcoin today is as important as some one buying 1BTC for a dollar in 2013 - we want more adoption - we want to make good use of the fee subsidy not wast it. 
It's only with economies of scale in transaction volume that fees can reduce and a resulting increase in block size that we can maintain the existing level of security as the reward drops.

Maybe if the little guy [80% of the worlds population earn less than $10 per day.]( could afford to buy bitcoin he may one day want to run a node. but he can't afford to even buy bitcoin today as the average BTC transaction is $1.12 is more than he can afford to invest. Even with the LN at $2.24 for open and close fee - he can't afford to use bitcoin, - who knows what the transaction cost would be if 1,000,000,000 people tried to open an close a transaction on the bitcoin network once a month.  
**India** 9 nodes - 1.252 billion people - *the little guy in India* does not want to run a node now.  - an estimate [300,000-400,000 people use bitcoin in India](
**Greece** 9 nodes - 11.03 million people *the little guy in Greece* does not want to run a node now.
**Italy** 46 nodes - 59.83 million people *the little guy in Greece* does not want to run a node now.
Its not the cost of running a node that is preventing people from doing so - its the need to run a node - the more people using the blockchain the greater the need.

The real threat to centralization is ignorance. "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." 
There are separate projects for sniping off with minority hash power or new PoW algorithms those are altcoins. - BU is Bitcoin - and the unit is BTC or XBT . Any implementation if they don't have the majority hashpower and want to split form bitcoin can do that, you can call it an altcoin. 
Bitcoin Unlimited BU always follows the longest honest bitcoin chain and the majority of bitcoin users, it will never become an altcoin, because it's bitcoin.
Bitcoin miners have no incentive to split/ fork without the majority of the network, BU miners won't destroy bitcoin - today they risk losing over $600,000 a day in income - more in the future. its incentives that govern miners - not r/bitcoin politics or Core Code, the incentives drive bitcoin forward.

segwits has a few benefits but mostly it has little added value, fyi transaction malleability is not an issue after you have 1 confirmation (RBF is like transaction malleability on steroids and they added that intentionally) 
SW does not seem to offer a net benefit when it comes to network bandwidth, it has a net benefit only on the storage space* needed to store a block.
*it's worth noting that the storage cost of the blockchain is the most insignificant cost in the bitcoin network ($300 = 6TB of block space)
It's also worth noting that the storage cost is  a donated resource, given by those who have an invested interest in the integrity of the data.
It's often said the cost of HD space puts centralizing pressure on nodes but it's insignificant if you actually look at the costs.
The most valuable resources is actually bandwidth, and SW optimizes storage cost at the expense of using up to 4x the bandwidth. 
it's worth understanding SW benefits brings in a new economic policy. for those who want to limit the blockchain growth to stimulate layer 2 networks like Lightening. SW gives a discount to very large transactions (ie. those created by Lightening hubs) in that they are only charged for transaction size based on the storage costs (which is donated) and not the added network bandwidth they utilize thus degrading the capacity of the network in their favor. 
it's the opposite of a compromise it's more like an attack.

@_date: 2017-03-13 08:15:44
BU represents user adjustable block size. BU was released in late 2015 it's only now being adopted as a decentralized way to govern block size recently. 
Adopting BU doesn't guarantee a fork it just allows all nodes to follow the longest honest bitcoin chain if a bigger block is ever mined. 
you can still signal for a 1MB block with BU if you think that's optimal. If enough people do, miners won't ever mine a bigger block.

Maybe Core could help them?
are the Core developers willing enough to let go of control and allow users to set the block limit, maybe they should merge those changes, and BU users will switch back to Core - I cant think of a better way to come to a decentralized decision on the matter of block size.

replay protection = transaction incompatibility
BU is designed to follow the bitcoin blockchain better than Core (in that BU will support larger blocks while Core won't) if BU implement replay protection ~~transaction incompatibility~~ they will fork off the bitcoin blcokchain as the existing infrastructure wont see the BU transactions. 
I can't see why the majority hash power and the BU supporters would want that - they want bitcoin to grow and to profit off their bitcoin investment.  
BU the federation does not have the mandate to implement "replay protection" if BU add it as a feature they have an obligation to make it user configurable so it would be an on/off switch - turn it on and you will be disconnected from the bitcoin network and the exchanges will list it as BTU - but only if everyone turns it on. I can't see BU's distributed control mechanism making that process happen. 
The exchanges are being forced to signal to make something happen but its not going to work, centralized planing always results in misallocation of resources. 
Core on the other hand could push something like that onto the network, they just need 100+ developers to agree - and then just add it to the next version and ask their flowers to upgrade.

I'm not the one who doesn't understand, you seem to be deluding yourself. 
It's decentralized development- with a centralized authority of incumbents who decides which commits get pulled, they are the ones who have have control. (it's less than 100 - more closer to 10) its very centralized! (geographic decentralization has no effect give the internet) 
BU is a good example of how open source works. - fork and move forward.


the consensus rules were defined when bitcoin was launched - they determine the 21M limit - no double spending, the emotion sachem, the block frequency and the difficulty. 
consensus rules are a social contract you agree to when you buy bitcoin. the 1MB limit does not affect the consensus rules, it was a soft fork rule implemented in 2010. 
transactions before the 1MB limit are valid according to the consensus rules, transactions after the 1MB limit are valid according consensus rules, transactions after the 1MB limit is removed will be valid according consensus rules.
its wrong to take the limit which is part of the transport protocol and call it a consensus rule - the misunderstanding is why we still have it. 
Consensus rules are reinforced as bitcoin grows, the 1MB limit is degraded. 
satoshi describes how rules are defined and maintained and supported. - the 1MB rule is not exempt. 


valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

what do you thing LN and sidechains do? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:04:05


That is just conjecture, the facts if you look a little closer suggest that is very simplistic thinking. 
the cost to propagate a block is not zero. 
there is a cost to validating transactions - the longer it takes the higher the orphan risk, miners are incentivizes to reduce confirmation time and block propagation to minimize that risk, the higher the risk the more they will charge, the less people will use. 
there are costs to making blocks bigger - orphan risk increases - still true with technologies like Xthin and Compact Blocks. as block size increases the relay times for missing transactions increase - a natural limit forms block that include a large number of transaction that have not propagates have a higher chance of being orphaned as they take longer to validate - that risk pushes up the cost to transact on the blockchain.  
so long as the cost to relay a block is not zero (it will never be) there is no tragedy of the common. storage is inconsequential and available network bandwidth determines max block size. 
 
LN and Bitcoin are complementary technologies, they both synergies and compete with each other but not if bitcoin transactions are forced onto the LN network because of limited block size. A limited block size gives LN and advantage over bitcoin, it could allow it to cannibalize fee paying on chain transactions, but remove the limit they are free to compete and balance in the market. 
it's not one or the other it's a chicken and an egg (bigger blocks being the egg).

It's just FUD if you don't understand economics. A spam attack is more viable with a limited block size.
so long as miners accept fees spam attacks can be managed my miners who take the attackers fees for processing transactions. If it's ever a a volume or block size issue where the additional size may increase orphan risk the miner just needs to raise the minimum fee.
The same spam attack with a limited block size would force up fees a lot faster and if perpetrated by a miner it would be quite profitable. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:47:39
It ~~is~~ was a rule to stop spam when it cost less than $1 to write a 32MB block before the soft fork limit. 
Today that risk of attack has gone, it costs over $15,000 in lost opportunity cost to write a block, - the incentive to destroy the network with spam is no longer viable.

I skipped FPGAs, couldn't see BFL ever delivering if they could mine profitability.  
I suspected if ASICs worked no one would sell them but rather mine with them.
my GPU farm was augmented with first gen AsicMiner hardware I quit Mid 2014 and soon after bought a batch of 3gen AsicMiner tubes which also provided to be very profitable. 
They're old but still produce a 30% profit above energy input cost.
I started selling during the past bull run because Bitcoin is not working as designed.

Mining hardware is still viable my hesitation is the lack of insight expressed by some developers.

only segwit transactions will be protected from transaction malleability, bitcoin transactions don't get the fix. 
removing transaction malleability also makes it possible to use smart contracts to enable a banking layer where banks lock up bitcoin and transact using bitcoin substitutes or banking tokens, as money. (like bitcoin but not bitcoin - and redeemable for bitcoin at a price)
the risk is the economy uses bitcoin substitutes and transactions never confirm on the blockchain - moving fee paying transactions off the bitcoin network and into a banking layer will have an impact on miner profitability and bitcoin security so there are economic trade offs that need to be considered befog removing transaction malleability.

here one of the prominent Core developers start by criticizing those **Austrian Economists who don't understand Money definitions.** The problem is Core Developers, beveling they control the code and therefor set economic policy. they should stick to developing and leave economic policy to bitcoin's decentralized network of users.

the consensus rules that were used when validating transactions pre the 1MB soft fork are still valid, and the consensus rules will still see all valid transactions today as valid when the 1MB soft fork limit is removed. it's wrong to confuse the consensus rules and the 1MB limit. 
the consensus rules are made stronger as bitcoin grows, the support for the 1MB soft fork limit is degraded as the network grows.

This type of attack would rely on a miner having a relative portion of hashing power analogous to miners today. Filing block space drives up all fees they run a disproportionate risk of loosing their spam to other miners, but profit on the higher fees paid by network users.
It would just take a cartel agreement of 51% of hashing power to eliminate all risk of loosing using this strategy. It could be undetectable and not appear hostile.
Obviously the cartel would be insecure if there were no block limit as it may be profitable to break from the cartel and go rogue collecting spam fees.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:42:16
for bitcoin to keep growing and mining profitability to increase at the historic rate we will need 20MB blocks by 2020.  
Your projection makes me very optimistic bitcoin will scale and work effectively. 
In March 2011 miners processed all transactions free and earned $50 per block at the peek of profitability. (Spam was a concern as transaction were free.)
Today a miner earns about $10,000 in subsidies and process over 1200 transactions on average per block and earn over $100 in fees. (Spam is no longer viable as it has a deterrent cost.) 
So an increase of 200% of subsidy, so thinking as if this was a projection miners should be able to process about $20,000 in fees towards the end of the next halving.
That's about 20MB per block. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:25:14
I have other skills. 
The gate keepers believe that the relay network is good miners use it because they get more income. This perversion of Bitcoin's incentive design is enforced by control of code and economics.
The gate keepers in this instance see bitcoin as a software protocol first and foremost. manipulating it they can gain power. Bitcoin is first and foremost a value exchange protocol only controlled by code.
The current gate keepers don't agree with that.

That's not how bitcoin was designed to work, the process is apolitical. 


The miners adopting BU are following the bitcoin design as intended by satoshi. 
the Core developers who are opposed to this are opposed to giving up the control they have over bitcoin. there is lots of FUD - people have to look critically ate everything.
Bitcoin may be a broken design - but I trust satoshi's original incentive design and the 8 years of empirical data that it works over a Core developer saying its broken, and they need to fix it. - they don't need to fix anything they need to buy a shit load of ASIC's and change the rules. the miners are mining coins I want - if you don't want them stop buying bitcoin sell and crash the price - miners mine the coins people want, and most people can't afford them if they have to pat $1.12 per transaction.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:52:58
Everyone knows that segwit uses block weight so we get an effective transaction increase to 2MB at the cost of 4MB - vs a strait 4MB increase gets more transactions for the same bandwidth. 
so if we increase to 4MB block limit, segwit = up to 16MB bandwidth usage - so it'll never happen.  If you want LN and 200MB blocks now is the time to act to increase the block size.
I'll let the CEO of Blockstream explain it to you.


so segwit is dead if we get a block increase, and a block increase is dead if we get segwit. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:34:46
yes, I believe the banks could keep them open for years. 
todatUS $1.12 is the average transaction cost, so $2.24 to open and close a LN payment channel for micro-payments.
some Core developers say the LN system still works when transaction fees are $100 -$1000 (between $200 and $2000 - to open and close a LN channel.) 
I'm pro the LN network but not while we have a block limit.

The average time to send a block over the great fire wall of China is now 7 seconds - the protocol allows for 10 minus on average.  Core followed with their version Compact Blocks. 
if there is a valid reason not to increase the block size limit we should address it, but refusing to consider it and hold the bitcoin network hostage threatening to excommunicate developers who help the BU team is not moving bitcoin development forward - its a nasty attempt at holding on to power.

Who does the mining in the white paper and how are conflicts on valid transactions resolved? 
It's not clear satoshi ever though nodes would stop mining, He called mining work - and finding a has Prof of Work.   
See section 5. emphasis mine. 


1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.
3) Each node **works** on finding a difficult **proof-of-work** for its block.
4) When a node finds a **proof-of-work**, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by **working** on creating the next block in the
chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.


that's not the behavior of what we call "nodes", that the behavior of miners - "relay nodes" are what we call nodes today - they are secondary, they trust what "Mining nodes" broadcast, verifying each block. (valid = a block full of valid transactions not being a block of valid transactions limited to 1MB.)

We agree that incentives matter. this is why developers are not in control, this is why we can make the 1MB soft fork limit user configurable. 


the chain is considered in context to the the majority honest has power, satoshi describes it accurately in the white paper, we have over 8 years of empirical data to support the original design. What you describe is not the majority network or an honest chain in the eyes of the majority rules. 


BU are not suporting "different rules" the transactions that exsisted pre - the 1MB soft fork limit are valid today, and will be valid after the 1B soft fork limit is removed.  
any rules that need to be changes has everything to do with hash rate and the incentives that preserve the network effect.

them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.* - the bitcoin white paper.

LN is a banking layer - fees paid on layer 2 networks don't secure the bitcoin blockchain. SW without removing the 1MB limit is a non starter. remove the limit then SW. 
we need LN but not at the expense of Bitcoin. the Lightening Network and the Bitcoin network can synergies - but they must compete - Bitcoin's limited transaction volume should not push fee paying transactions onto the LN. - NL must attract bitcoin fee paying transactions.

@_date: 2017-03-19 06:39:07
LN and Bitcoin will be great together - they complement each other. 
however if 1,000,000,000 people put their salary in bitcoin, opened a LN channel at the binning of the month and closed it at the end of the month we'd have 2 billion on chain transactions a month.
I believe people will use LN because it is useful, I also believe people will be forced into using it if the block size is limited, which won't be good for bitcoin adoption.  
To keep the complementary synergy between LN and Bitcoin they need to both compete to stay effective. the two types of transactions serve different needs. 
The evidence used to block the removal of the the block size limit does not justify the concern that block size will be abused. There are multiple real costs to including more transactions. I suspect on chain transactions will never be so cheep that they degrade the need for payment channels like LN.

It's too little too later, it's still a block limit.
firstly the 1MB block limited remains. What's happening is segwit replaces the block limit with block weight. While you can fit a few more transaction into the 1MB block the signature move to the block weight limit.
The new accounting rules give a disproportionate advantage to segwit transactions - they get a 75% discount rate on block weight - while still reducing the available space in the 1MB block limit. 
It's cleaver and all, but for a 4MB segwit block you get about half the number of transaction you could fit in a typically block if the limit was moved. 
This idea needs more time to mature fundamentally if we move the block limit to 4MB we'll get a segwit block size up to 16MB. So adopting segwit now is a sure nail in the coffin when it comes to a simply block limited increase.

It's nuanced and complicated but BU supporters are not opposed to segwit per se, it's ordering of priorities. 
BU decentralized decision making - removing the idea that block size should be decided by a centralized authority. 
the transaction malleability change proposed with Segwit will allow layer 2 solutions to move fee paying transactions off the bitcoin blockchain. - that's all good and well but that impacts the fees that are going to be paid to miners to secure bitcoin. 
The market problem is a limited block size created demand for layer 2 transactions, the market based approach would be to allow a block size increase and then enable layer 2 networks and have them compete and complement with each other.

FYI, it's not the code that protects the 21M, anyone can change the code to support whatever monetary cap they like. What protects the 21M are the incentives to be connected to the economic majority who are invested in preserving the value created by the 21M cap. You sound like a nut repeating a centralized authoritarian propaganda tell everyone economics speculation along these lines may lead you to believe that inflation beyond 21M is necessary and should be added as a feature. 
There is nothing technical in your reply it's all unsubstantiated conjecture. all my points are consistent with the incentives that grow bitcoin and preserve the value in the 21M cap.  
lets look at my position on fees using this framework, I'd love an honest reply: 
What should the optimum transaction fee subsidy be to maximize bitcoin distribution and growth?
* 99.9%, 
* 99%, 
* 98%, 
* 96%, 
* between 95% or 90%, 
* no subsidized fees.

MV=PT monetarist theory gives us insight as to the value of a transaction give the value of the network. M and T are fixed.
There are lots of scenarios were fees kill adoption. And lots of scenario where lack of ability to write to the blockchain kills adoption.
But bitcoin is about technical code working not about economics and adoption so everything is good so long as it running a node is cheap it not a problem if node operators can't afford to use the blockchain.

there is no proper solution, just trad offs and risks. the solution that best fits the bitcoin ethos is decentralized consensus in keeping with apolitical consensus mechanism of CPU voting designed into bitcoin and described in the white paper, it also is the solution with the lowest risk profile. 
Segwit changes bitcoin fundamentally, you cant stop it, but the safe way to allow bitcoin to scale is to remove the soft fork 1MB block size limit before introducing new changes like segwit. 
the two could happen simultaneously with greater risk, but most practically block limit removal then segwit.

we agree,


removing the block limit is not a threat to bitcoin's survival it's the opposite it's allow in it to grow stronger.  


nonsense there are no facts to support that position, Other than a few fundamentalists insisting on making that scenario materialize if the bitcoin block size is increased.

they do have a point though bitcoin may never scale, it may be 2.0 blockchain technologies that do and when they become too big to fail they'll just drop bitcoins limited 3 transactions per second blockchain and adopt a new inflation variant.

That's a good question.
Miners will have the same control with 1MB limit and without. they have absolute control now but no incentive to use it - this will be true with 1MB limit or any other user defined limit, they follow what the economic majority want - they need us to value the coins they mine.

Segwit may be the best code ever written that's not being debated here, it's a side issue. If the changes are worthwhile we can discuss them in another 5 years. 
what is being debated today is: 
Consensus mechanism is PoW - it's what gives the network value and keeps intensives functioning, Consensus is not lobbying, lawyer and letter of intent.
Core developers are using political will to push changes onto the network. - they don't represent me, or the miners. 
What technical arguments support keeping a block size limit, this debate has been going on since 2011, I've been involved since mid 2013. segwit is a political side show - developer song and dance.

re teh smamming limit working, haha, spamers could have spammed the network to 1MB when it limit was 8 orders of magnitude above the then transaction volume. 
given Mores Law and the fact we now pay fees a limit at least 1 order of magnitude is not unrealistic. 
fees prevent spam, forced fees prevents growth. (we the investors in bitcoin are subsidizing fees by design. Its called inflation. forcing fees during the next 5 years while the reward is so high is double dipping.) and going to impact bitcoins growth negatively.

we should put that statement in perspective 100+ developers are welcome to make BU better.
what's being opposed is: who's in control - do users get to set the block limit or do a centralized group of 100+ developers control the block limit. (80+ of them make spelling corrections and write help files - just 20 or so have any say on the future direction and changes)

@_date: 2017-03-14 05:00:52


Miners have absolute control of Block size now - the only think keeping them from moving it is that most nodes will reject a bigger block, and they will suffer losses. 
With BU Miners have the same control and the the same incentive - the only think keeping them from making it too large is that most nodes will reject a bigger block, and they will suffer losses. 


Core say they have over 100 developers but in reality over 80 or so make miner contributions and correct typos and write help files. While development is distributed and open, there are fewer than 20 incumbent developers governing what changes are accepted and which ones are rejected for the entire network. - that is the very centralization you seek to avoid. 
There is a big difference between miners and developers - the Miners need you to remain confident in them and create demand for the coins they mine they need to be honest where as developers the influential ones who control core make changes for a salary - and what they do is driven form incentives outside the bitcoin incentive design. 
I don't share your confidence. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:23:10
Segwit does not increase the 1MB block size soft fork limit. - it introduces a new parameter called block weight that allows a few extra transactions to fit in the 1MB block limit - that's actually a fact. 


that's not a fact - and public opinion is manipulated so we can't depend on that data. We can depend on bitcoin. Satoshi designed an apolitical way to derive consensus. - if you want PublicVoteCoin - bitcoin may not be for you.

this attack can be done today it will clog up the mempoom and cause mining congestion and crash nodes. we have no defense against it now, we've only seen a prof of concept test. 
the nasty attack is one that pays a fee with each transaction pushing legitimate tragic off the network or artificially forcing up the fee market. a miner can calculate the lose fees to competitors but still increase profits by raising the bar, if i was to partake in such a shame, I would corporate with all willing miners to mitigate losses sucking fee wealth out of the economy.   The solution is call their bluff take the fee, spammer looses. The problem is the limited block size makes the cartel profitable.
it can only be broken when the fees at risk get stolen by a cartel member and it cant happen while block size is limited, the limit enforces the cartel

Sure, bandwidth is the most fundamental technical constraint. 
it's not what causes centralization or centralized control. 
but being efficient with bandwidth the most scares of all resources in the bitcoin network is all important! a 4MB block limit makes better use of the same bandwidth than segwit does, if you measure the number of transactions per block. If we increase the block size to 8MB most nodes wont need to upgrade for years as bitcoin grows into that bandwidth. 
the good news is the trend is looking up for internet growth and bandwidth so no need to limit bitcoin growth until that trend starts to revere, not that i think its a good thing to prevent growth after all more users = more security more decentralization and more value for bitcoin adopters.   
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:58:58
Core will most likely just move the limit and move on, I can't see any economic incentive or evidence that 1MB is the magic number that preserves bitcoin's growth. in fact it seems the exact opposite. limited block size is causing centralization, allows KYC AML monitoring of all on and off-ramps. 
I cant see the benefit of running a node that costs $2 per day to run when it costs $20 to do a bitcoin transaction. 
something had got to give if you believe the price of BTC is going up.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:03:34
Miners don't have an incentive to block and not build on blocks.
The AD is a feature for non mining nodes, the risk of loss to a miner in picking a pre-fork fork and rejecting a block that has propagated the network and they can validate and build on in good time would discourage. it cost's money to execute with no reward, The behavior u/jonny1000 is advocating as an attack vector has no motive. 
Jonny why don't miners can reject blocks now and construct and build on the longest fork? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:18:14


that's OK. do you have a reason why? 


that's not true, I want bigger block and millions of other people who use bitcoin also want bigger blocks, there are about a billion people who don't use bitcoin yet and they'll want to use it too. so yes those who want the price to clime want bigger blocks. bitcoin is not an exclusive club is open and distributed.

In June of 2010 it would cost about $3500 to write a 114GB of data to the blockchain. (that's the size it is today) 
Anyone interested in using bitcoin in 2010 myself included would not want to download 114GB of data to test an experimental digital currency. 
The 1MB soft fork limit prevented that abuse. 
Today with if we had a 32MB block limit it would cost $43,750,000 in lost opportunity cost, to write that much data to the block chain. the estimated hardware cost to write that data assuming one had 100% of the hardware would be in the realm of $700,000,000.
what makes the bitcoin incentive design so elegant, is if you invest money to attack the network - you can get a better return on that money by cooperating honestly than you can attacking it. 
this was not always the case - while it cost just a few dollars to write a block the network was susceptible to attack. - the 1MB limit reduced this attack vector.

They are making a difference in the face of all odds, in fact it's people like this who ever made a difference. Satoshi being the quintessential role model.

BU always follows the longest honest chain and the majority of bitcoin users, it will never become an altcoin, because it's bitcoin, there are separate projects for sniping off with minority hashpower those are altcoins. - BU is Bitcoin - BTC. Core if they don't have the majority hashpower and want to split form bitcoin can do that. - you can call that coin BCC they will probably have to change the PoW to support the 1MB altcoin. 
Bitcoin miners have no incentive to split/ fork without the majority of the network, BU miners won't destroy bitcoin - they risk losing over $600,000 a day in income. its incentives that govern miners - not r/bitcoin politics or Core Code.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:00:58
Its not semantics, bitcoin is an apolitical protocol governed by incentives - derived from consensus rules that define honest transactions have changed! 
a soft fork rule that limits block size was added - BU just makes it user configurable. 
I'm not the one who has a fundamentalist attitude. I can see whats going on. we can just change the 1MB limit that's all I'm advocating.

This makes no sense because right now the network can manage 10X the transaction capacity we have now ( we would will grow into it slowly not all at once maybe in 5-10 years) so why limit it now by saying we cant grow to 100X so we going to block the 10X capacity increase.

anyone can change whatever parameter of the bitcoin code they like, they have to follow majority consensus to stay connected. That incentive is strong, it's what keeps bitcoin together.  Both Core and BU depend on the users and nodes to set the block limit, - Core just has 100+ developers to set it for you.

That's a problem, bitcoin is a P2P value exchange protocol. the incentives are important.  If the developers don't appreciate the economic incentives they shouldn't be changing them. 
Bitcoin is managed by incentives first code second. without the incentives the cost to run a node is irrelevant, Developers should priorities incentives above node's cost, the cost is secondary, only those who have an incentive to run a node will do so, reducing the cost does not increase the incentive, it merely lowers the barrier to eatery.


no one is saying it can, lots of people believe it will scale with layer 2 networks in time. 
We know segwit will use 4MB of network bandwidth per block less efficiently that a 4MB block limit. just because a 4MB block limit is viable there is no reason to block it. 


I beleve most interested in bitcoin understand that the Internet's limitations have improved immensely over the last 8 years they can see that the 1MB limit has remained static and has not adjusted to accommodate the technological limitations of the internet.

I don't assume this:


I know they can't without severally damaging their income, the Nash Equilibrium dictates the bitcoin intensives stay aligned. 


that's conjecture (repeat a lie enough times and people will believe it - its nonsense)  - my cheep little node at home can't get any cheaper, yet it can handle 20MB blocks today. In my city one that has hundreds of bitcoin meetups with thousands of enthusiasts attending only has 16 nodes despite it being so cheep to run a node ($30 for a home internet connection - they all have internet). most of those bitcoiners are not running nodes and they are not going to want to use bitcoin if it costs more to send a transaction than it does to run a node.
already today if you send 1 transaction a day it's more expensive to use bitcoin than run a node.  - You have a hyper-privileged, - and you are not making bitcoin available to the world if you limit block size.

LOL, when a bitcoin transaction costs $7 (about the cost of a subsidized transaction today) and the daily cost of running my full node (mine costs $1.67 a day and can handle 20MB blocks) people wont be incentivised to run a node.

Those reasons are not reasons to block a block limit increase. 
FYI Ghash.io orphaned it's own block, because they would try mine on top of their own blocks instead of mining on top of the networks blocks. The relay network did not fix that, it propagated Ghash.io's block to the network faster reducing their orphan rate and pushing them above 51%.  The relay network did not fix anything, it introduced new game theory.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:59:22
The bitcoin design has an apolitical consensus mechanism that's been in oppression since inception, it's called PoW, bitcoin should use it.
Developers are subservient to miners who enforce the rules in the interest of the network. Miners are subservient to users confidence (the market price)
The developers have over reached in an attempt to force segwit. The technical debate you refer to is inconsequential, it's not about segwit. The developers are using propaganda, lobbying and politics to get miners to include new rules, that's what this debate is about. (who is in control?) 
The developers are not in a technical debate about code at all, but a political one, in an attempt to convince miner and users to accept the new code they have made that change the bitcoin rules.

I've given you a great number of economic arguments and you are ignoring them, I am not ignoring the science or the engendering, I'm not ignoring the engineers. I'm trying to communicate but my efforts keep being deleted my concerns and questions ignored. 
I see evidence that the code maintainers are ignoring economics, science and technical progress. LN and Bitcoin will compliment each other, for prudent economic reasons LN should not happen before the block limit is removed.

@_date: 2017-03-13 09:46:31
that's not implied by my writings at all. 
my node costs less than $2 a day it's part of my home internet. if blocks went to 20MB tomorrow my costs wouldn't change. 
most home internet connections will handle 8MB blocks before the any increase in price, and in 5 years time it'll be the same price but the data a home internet connection can handel will grow. so - unless we get 1GB blocks very rapidly we are not going to get nodes that cost hundreds of dollars a day to run.
but the time is coming when it costs more to send a single bitcoin transaction than it costs to run a node for a day. that will cause centralization, not sure who will be using bitcoin much is that happens. 
the incentive design in bitcoin ensures you don't have to trust anyone, miners are inherently more trust worthy as they are dependent on you and I being confident in the price of the coins they mine, developers on the other hand are not incentivizein by the bitcoin design, but by money from outside of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:17:18
The issue is economic, the developers need to find ways to make it work. 1MB or 1.1MB block size is an irrelevant limit.

u/tl121 makes a good argument for who is responsible for replay protection.


After the chain has split and is deemed to be a real split (not just random orphan event) then there are various ways a holder can move his coins to an address that is valid on only one chain and this can be done twice, creating two piles of coins, one pile for each chain.


Since this is purely local, then each exchange can divide its holdings using whatever method it deems fit. And each exchange can name the forks each way it seems fit. There is no need for a central authority. Debating about how these matters should be handled serves no purpose, unless one's purpose is to create FUD that will delay people from proceeding with the fork.

all transactions from before the 1MB limit are still valid transactions according to the consensus mechanism. The 1MB limited is not needed to derive consensus on valid transactions. 
Satoshi wrote an incentive mechanism - here is how he describes it:


**honest chain** "≠" 1MB chain! 
**not going to accept an invalid transaction** = nodes follow consensus rules.

The 2 complement each other. But if the block size is limited to 2.1MB and if fee paying transactions are forced of the bitcoin network and onto layer-2 networks, who's going to pay for security and the miners to mine blocks?
LN allows users to make more transactions, but bigger blocks allows more users to use the blocchain.  
We need the networks to complement and compete with each other.

What are your thoughts on Bitcoin centralization, while nodes are fairly well distributed according to city density, with exceptions like China.
There is concern that the protocol is run on a single implementation with Top 5 node implementations run 68% of network, that 68% of the uses a centralized code base that is centrally controlled much like a monoculture in an ecosystem. 
for a healthy decentralized network bitcoiners should be looking to diversify the code base that protects the protocol.    
what are your thoughts should we all be running Bitcoin Core, leaving the protocol to be managed for us or should we be partaking in the network?

Larger blocks aren't a game changer we all still agree on the fundamentals, larger blocks just means more transaction. We have forks every day where the network agrees to follow the majority on the longest chain.
XT is not an alt it is an alternate implementation of the Bitcoin protocol (similar to Core) if the majority need more transaction the less desirable blocks will be orphaned.
No controversy not hostility all safe working just like it was designed to do.

From what I understand it gives the power to miners to set the block size (all be it with a vote?) 
that's all good and well knowing miners should set there own block size, so on the service BIP100 seems fine.
Miners also dont pay the cost for large blocks, the nodes do, and as [Peter_R has proved mathematically]( , Satoshi's original design optimizes block size based on market demand, while leaving nodes with ultimate control, (and removing the need for nodes or developers to manage block size)  
So the issue I see with BIP100 is if the majority of Miners collude to form a cartel to set the limit they can set it too low to suite their preferences, the difference between BIP 100 and BIP 101, is in BIP100 miners cant leave the carrell and mine bigger blocks if there is a market for it, in the case with BIP100 the cartel needs to vote. 
Where with BIP101 Miners can form a cartel but if it becomes more profitable to mine larger blocks they can break from the cartel without having to get a majority vote.
the innate incentive that limits the ability for cartels to form is important, BIP 100 is a change to an innate incentive in Bitcoin.  
playing devils advocate here and creating a worse case scenario, imagine the optimal market equilibrium for block size and transaction cost resulted in the demand for a 16MB block, a majority of miners could form a voting cartel, and set a limit at 8MB, there would be no reason to do this in a free market because they would loose revenue, but in a controlled market for transaction fees where Sidechains exist, it becomes possible to manipulate the block size to undermine competition, a simple way to do it would be to limit your completion's revenue by limiting block size, if you were uncompetitive in block propagation that would give you an unfair advantage. In the case with SideChains the cartel could supplement revenue by being paid to Merge Mining side-chains that other miners dont have assess too. 
giving the power to the miners to set block size by vote to the majority will ultimately tend towards centralization, where in BIP101 this power is vested in the market and incentives that govern it. More important, it's not a change to Satosis design which seems to have the incentive balance just right.

I think your backing the wrong crowd, *Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes it's laws*, is an apt concern, and its real in bitcoin, you're overlooking the central control that is dominating bitcoin and changing it to something new. 
It'snot the people who have floated the idea of tracking, (or killing Bitcoins fungibility) that are a threat, that's public knowledge on the blockchain already, its the people who are changing the code that governs the protocol that are the threat.

That's a great point, Bitcoins killer app is the size of the network of end users. The value nicely correlated to Metcalfe's law. There is no competition on that front.
I envision it like this: Bitcoin is better money, it was better money as soon as it was used as such, that is the innovation Bitcoin is a quantum shift with regards to the idea of money. Having Bitcoin 2.0 solutions is an insignificant incremental improvement. The more competition the better it only makes Bitcoin killer app (a network who want just better money) stronger.

all miners if they understood Bitcoin would be backing BIP 100 it gives more power to the miners, they get to set the block size - even if it means voting as a cartel at the expense of the network.

What you're suggesting is a change to how things work, decentralized pegged sidechains could be used to make innovations to alts and be backed by bitcoin.
This takes fee pressure out of the Bitcoin blockchain leaving the need to limit block size the only control to prevent Bitcoin abused.
Kim running Mega on the blockchain is not a good idea if he wants control of his business. If he uses to much bandwidth and storage on the blockchain it will be defined as spam. 
The maths show us that the cost to write to the blockchain increase so we would expect the cost to use Mega to increase. This increase in cost is not something Kim can control. Yet it affects his business so it's not likely he would add a variable cost to his business that will increase as it scales.
If he is ignorant of how the system works he'll lose as his business scales.

Bitcoin BIP 101 advocates are still a minority (I'm thinking in terms of Bitcoin adoption and potential users.)

Nodes collectively are the keepers of the Bitcoin protocol, they keep and run the rules that miners use to validate blocks.
Running a node secures the decentralization of the network, choosing which implementation to run is important too.
The most widely implemented version is Core it is centrally controlled. Running a core node by default homogenizes the network to a point where the benefits of decentralized deployment are superseded by centralized control of what code is run.
Running a Bitcoin node using a different implication like Bitcoin XT, btcd or libbitcoin helpless decentralized control.
To run a node you need to open port 8333 on your router to the computer of your node. There you can edit a config file to limit the number of connections if you are concerned about bandwidth. 
At the moment and for the for the next few years your connection is more than adequate, the limitation is you cap, my home connection is capped at 300GB per month so running a node uses a trivial amount of data.

Yes it will but not in the way most keep talking about.
Today people talk about the unbanked and how Bitcoin will lubricate their economic activity. That's true but the impact is not so much that they will be globally economic actors.
The biggest burden on the un-banked is that they use cash that is inflating the value of their efforts away. The poorer the country the bigger the inflation tax the poor pay.
It's the fixed supply and unlimited velocity of transactions that will empower them. The wealth lost to inflation will stop and the poor will benefit.

you need to consider subsidies distort free markets.
Bitcoin is designed to grow and work with no limits, there should be no fees and no limit, those are issues introduced by developers. fees and block limits are a function of market viability. (dont get me wrong free transactions are not guaranteed but just a probability)   
1) Transaction fees are subsidized by block rewards and will be for many years to come. (we pay the transaction costs with inflation of bitcoin given to miners) 
2) Miners get the fees and the subsidies for writing transactions to the blockchain, they dont pay the storage costs for those transactions.

There is also a correlation Metcalfe's law where node connections are defined as a function of transaction volume.

The what you put it in your edit is just how I see it. Yesterday's fork proves you can compete no matter how big blocks are but you also need to validate blocks or risk loss Peter_R provided a  framework to understand how this works. So if blocks are too big small miners would be advantaged and if you don't validate at all validating miners will be advantaged.

It should, just like electricity, warehousing, and security costs are all part of the business viability calculation.
I find it shocking that Core developers give the Chinese miners a voice at the table, and an opportunity to have the protocol optimized to overcome their shortcomings.

I follow no gods, removing the limit is a logical deduction for growth to occur, Bitcoin's block size needs to change to allow that to happen in an organic way. Your ferver is way to fundamental to be healthy. 
the negative consequence that Bitcoin will remain centralized in the hands of the developers as a result of inaction are way too severe to support 1MB block size limit for now.  
The real point you are ignoring is limiting Bitcoins transaction volume, is not a change for the good of the Bitcoin community.

It's not dark. If it's a problem the fix is of the same magnitude as nullc proposed for increasing the block size if it became necessary (developers will all agree there is a problem and just change it). Just this time the default is in line with Bitcoin's original intent.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:09:34
That's not what's happening.
Peter Todd's full-RBF  breaks Bitcoin zero-confirm transactions and, postponing block increases, provides impetus to use off-chain solutions like LN even making them more secure than zero-confirm Bitcoin transactions which could be reversed - and in combination with bigger blocks would also be less secure even after 1 confirmation.

Still the money we use today as a system of accounting is a fabricated story of value signals, we the people use it for the reasons you describe but the vast majority of money in existence is a story and part of a lie, it's comes into existence at the whim of a few and is used to capture productive assets for the elite at the expense of the people who create value.

For me it's simple I only trust multiple confirmations for any meaningful transaction size, however when dealing with individuals I on a face to face basis I need to trust. The trust does not need to be in the maths but the individuals technical ability, the tools they use to initiate payment and their personality type, if a tool existed to reverse a face to face transaction that I knew had been initiated I would be less trusting and Bitcoin would have less utility.
While this proposal does not change some thinks it makes small transactions less trustworthy while making off chain transactions more trustworthy, and that is damaging to the future of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 05:13:04
Bitcoin is and has always been 21M limit in units but unlimited number of transactions. 
The equation for determining value of the money supply is MV=PT that's Money supply x Velocity of transaction (spending) is equal to Price x the number of Transactions. 
So one way to think of it is M is fixed so the only variable in the equation is V the number of transactions. So limiting supply and transaction volume will cap the price. The only way to keep Bitcoin a closed system and allow the price to rise is to make it useful for more people that equates to more transaction volume. I.e. bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:50:38
That would make a good cover but it can't be moving value out of the blockchain changes the incentive structure that makes Bitcoin work.

This is my thought too, yet people want to change the layer-0 protocol, an economic exchange protocol on which we run value transactions.
They want to change the incentives that manage protocol to run other services for other layers. 
I want to see new protocols run on top of Bitcoin, however it's responsible to change the layer-0 protocol without consideration for the economic intensives that protect it without impacting how the base layer works. 
Something the for profit companies proposing the layer-0 protocol changes refuse to do.

Changing the block size was always going to be a hard fork from the moment it was implemented back back in 2010.
its unrealistic to want to keep it. (reminds me of filling a bath, when we want to fill it but we dont want change, well you going to get change either way, either you; change the flow of the water into the bath; change the size of the bath; or watch the water overflow, its all change take your pick.) 
I'm in the lets change the size of the bath camp, when the bath is the size of an ocean, I'll start advocating to reduce the water flow. 
No one predicted the Bitcoin developers would hack the block size limit when it was implemented, - that is block the change and saying things like "Nobody is against increasing the limit, we just dont want to increase it for now" while they build competing of-chain scaling solutions. you are going to change the incentives that make bitcoin grow economically, by keeping the limit, or your going to change the limit. you can't avoid change.  
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:25:03

As we know that's true and the flip side of that is if you don't do full validation you run a risk of mining invalid blocks as we just saw. Also SPV mining empty blocks is also only viable while miners are subsidized by inflation. As the block reward diminishes mining empty block becomes less profitable.

Wrong. smart contracts are just contracts. Someone has to write the contract and both parties need to agree on it.
Sidechains are not that.
A smart contract involves trust and penalties, that can be executed without a 3rd party, sidechains offload that trust onto the Bitcoin network, for the benefits of other party's. (The trust in a smart contract is derived by each party doing its Due diligence, the Bitcoin network is not affected.)
Risk has to exist, sidechains elements is a stable system and the risk is blockstream will steel your coins. (That is an example of a balance system.)
Sidechains underwriter by the security in the incentives of the Bitcoin protocol that move value out of Bitcoin are changing the value in the blockchain that is needed to secure it.
The trust is offload to the users of the Bitcoin network to benefit the users of the sidechains.

a 2-way peg with a federation of semi-trusted servers is fine, users put trust in the servers. 
a 2-way peg with an SPVp managed by the Bitcoin Protocol is not the same (users put trust in the miners whose actions are governed by the value stroked in the Bitcoin blockchain not the value stored in other chains.) 
The change in incentives for miners puts the whole system at an elevating risk as rewards diminish. 
that's a bad idea, bitcoin is not just a protocol governed by code, its a protocol governed by incentives, 
Some core developers understand the code very well but dont express the will to preserve the intended structure of incentives that were originally proposed to make Bitcoin work. 
Adam Back is one of those people who should have recognized it on first exposure. I would have expected him to have seen how the incentive structure makes it work long before he got involved, yet he is working for people who intend to change the very incentive structure that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin for a profit.

I'd agree however their strategy looks to be effective should they at least validate the block on top of the one they build.

what is overlooked and missing in the Point of View you posted is discourse over the economic impact sidechains will have on the Bitcoin protocol.
Moving transaction fees off the main chain, will reduce the economic incentives that secure the protocol as block rewards diminish, 
It is a radical idea to suggest Bitcoin may fail or become obsolete by a yet to be invented superior sidechain while incorporating the seeds of Bitcoins destruction in the Bitcoin protocol itself.
The long time frame is only relevant because between 100% and 96% of transaction costs are subsidies by the Bitcoin users through inflation as propagated by the block rewards issued to those who write the transactions to the blockchain.

She gets it, BTC are just a token that is used to describe how much of the global money ledger we control. 
There is one way in, and one way out and that is to exchange value.
It's the value stored on the immutable global value exchange memory ledger that motivates miners to earn part of it in exchange for providing us with liquidity.
Money is memory and the blockchain is written proof of the history.
BTC are just tokens to help us bridge the fiat gap and allow for a denominator to measure how much blockchain you control.
@_date: 2015-07-29 02:45:15
Funny how miners get all the fees and nodes pay the storage cost.
By not raising the block limit the Core Developers over at central control are playing with the balance of power in the incentives as originally proposed in the Bitcoin white paper by allowing a market for tx fees to artificially be manipulated up to benefit miners at the cost of users.
@_date: 2015-07-05 02:05:33

we're now told we need 30 confirmations. see theymos's pined post at the top of r/Bitcoin 
and there are developers pushing for [full-RBF](
if implemented will mean you can reverse a transaction with 100% certainty before it is confirmed, and it's not secure until you have 30 confirmations. 
this sucks if you want to do OTC bitcoin trading.  (you should sit in the coffee shop for about 5 hrs making small talk while you wait for your transaction to confirm. )
if its not obvious by now, many core developers see bitcoin as a sentimental network and are changing it to suite, im not convinced this is the best way to do it, gold was people money before it was a settlement reserve.

invest in under performing Sidechain - get your money back.

**what happened to the risk?** 
Sidechains are like out current financial system.
if value moves permanently into a sidechain the risk is distributed among the remaining bitcoin holders, the decreasing value that moves out of Bitcoin reduces the incentives to protect bitcoin.
eventually systematic risk builds up, and we know bitcoin mining rewards decrease so we can predict with 100% certainty that sidechains will eventual destroy bitcoin.

It looks to me like the inherent incentives limit block size. There will always be arguments to say the game theory at play isn't valid and we can't count on the protocol and market behavior overcome the concerns.
If there are reasons why the protocol allows for deviant behavior like taking fees and adding transactions to blocks without verification that would be the place to focus development efforts.

@_date: 2015-07-05 21:03:33
Centralized controls to discourage centralization is not the logical choice.
Encouraging decentralization when we can't agree on a definition is a mute point too, we want a resilient network impervious to corruption.
SPV mining seems to be widely practices, by the looks of it big blocks is a problem for propagation, this is how the protocol was designed it's a feature not a bug.
Getting the balance right is the market opportunity. Even without large blocks miners make mistakes as we've just seen. 
In the future miners will use different strategies, those who have cheep electricity will have different advantages to those who have bandwidth and lots of local nodes.
The goal of Bitcoin is not and was never to have everyone run a node, there are enough incentives to keep nodes independent. It's more risky to have 99% of the nodes run a centralized implication of protocol. 
 
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:00:02
It is very important! It will eventually account for 100% of miners income and secure the network.
What you may be overlooking and and this point applies to most of the Core developers who don't address the fact that between 100% and 96% of he fees are in fact being subsidized by the users of the network. 
The subsidy comes in the form of inflation and is distributed to miners every 10 minutes.
If the Core developers understood this they would not say things like transaction fees are too low and Bitcoin won't survive if TX fees don't increase without a little help so we need to limit block size.
They should address the fact that fees are at a level that is appropriate given somewhere between 100% and 96% of the transaction cost is being subsidized by the network of users.
It would be crazy economics to have a discussion about the appropriate taxi fare, in relationship to the cost of service without addressing the fact that all fares are being subsidized by between 100% and 96%.
It's also worth noting that fee dependants is designed into the protocol and won't come into effect while the network is growing. This is buy design.

better average Joe knows now than later. 
a DOS attack is defined as what you call "a valid usecase" where the market is sending transactions or not paying high enough fees to get added in a 1MB block, it is circumvented by keeping the limited space but charging more per transaction to be confirmed. 
this is not how bitcoin was designed to work, it is just how a small group of developers who have centralized control of the software that runs on the majority of nodes feel bitcoin should work.  
in my view the stress testes are being done on a voluntary bases to prove 1MB is too small, and still subject to attack and larger blocks are safer.

Nodes maintain transaction history because they have a vested interest in bitcoin.
Arguing as the Core developers do that fee pressure is needed to reduce block size is wrong. That's the point. 
Bitcoin was not designed to have limited transaction and limited units, changing Bitcoin so miners benefit from limiting transactions is uncharted, thinking Bitcoin will grow under such a change is ignorant.

There is always competitior mining for fees. the market will make the miners that find the sweet spot between a natural limit of the number of transactions and cost the most profitable.
Fees will be a balance between maximize block propagation (making small blocks that will propitiate fast) and charging as much as you can in a competitive market. Economics of scale and competitive fees will keep. Bitcoin competitive.

No one is whacking the block size up. 
MV=PT 
we all know Bitcoin value will go up and in the equation above M (the 21M cap) is fixed and V (velocity = blocksize) must increase.
Without bigger blocks value will not materialize in the Bitcoin Blockchain. 
big blocks is a good thing if your invested in Bitcoin, blocks only grow id the value of Bitcoin grows.

The funny thing is they (these rogue developers who feel they are in charge) don't have a road map for increased adoption, it's like the new users aren't going to be individuals and businesses benefiting from the system , but institutions and governments who would be better off building there own networks.  
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:26:09

keep dreaming. 
Federated sidechains (Sidechain Elements) is a great product.
Sidechanes dependent o the SPV proof in the bitcoin protocol changes the incentives and is a treat to Bitcoin and the protocal. 
Sidechanes with SPV proof are not Bitcoin, they will never be unless you convince everyone they are better off serving other authorities.

I dont care what you think Satoshi wrote, I see what he has created and I'm invested in that, I will not allow ignorant people to change it without a concern. 
If Satoshi's writings are anything to go buy he thought bigger blocks could be introduced around 2011-03-25 15:27:29
If Adam Back understood Bitcoin he wouldn't have been a skeptic, he only changed his mind about Bitcoin in 2013 once Bitcoin was considered a success. 
Adam Back and his cohort work for the people who pay their salaries. The most powerful of those people are not invested in Bitcoin, but invested in a company paying the majority of Bitcoin Core developers to change Bitcoin into something else.

I'll add they are also hiding being the fact that they agree block size must increase, however not for now. (calling it plausible deniability)  
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:32:43
Agree are we all have financial incentive, most Bitcoiners are aligned in we benefit when Bitcoin is adopted.
Blockstream are not so aligned in they don't benefit directly from Bitcoin adoption but directly from moving the value 99.99% of Bitcoiners have off the blockchain onto side chains. (They help move the value and use clever code to preserve the BTC private key) 
you can always get you BTC back but the incentives needed to protect the value in the Bitcoin blockchain move to the Sidechain.
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:27:17
Do we need an authority to set economic policy?
Bitcoin was conceived as a balance of incentive free of central control with no limit on transaction volume (aka block size) 
@_date: 2015-07-07 05:26:00
It just makes the transactions confirm late until the need for transaction diminishes. (That's the equivalent of waiting for the network to shrink back down in size so the backlog can clear) 
If we want growth and those invested in Bitcoin do we need many more transactions to happen on the blockchain. And we need to grow when we stall not shrink back down.

That's not what's the 1MB for now proponents are working on.

One possible explanation is they've looked at LukeJr's research and determined 60% of bitcoin tragic is spam.
Another could be leverage, BTCC being a large player may in fact be putting a little pressure on on blockchain transactions to create more demand for their off blockchain sidechain called liquid.

I still like the idea, most non techies in my opinion would pay $5 for a OS image off a slick website that was open and secure (secure being feature of the OS lacking network ability.) and supported by an open community.
And techies can get the package free - they would just nave to compile the open source. 
I also think there is an opportunity for wallet designers to get a license fee for each paid customer, all they would need to do is sign a certificate that proves the wallet implication was the one they released. 
And the part that made this exciting to me is it could become an autonomous company avoiding regional tax.
Unfortunately this project ranks about 5th on my wish list. But that said I can input design (as in web and graphic and video design) and would be willing to split the load if there were others involved.

This is ignorance. But it's these people who will put wealth into Sidechains without the understanding of where the blockchain security comes from.
They are the economic majority and there actions make or break Bitcoin.
Keeping Bitcoin incentives unchanged is the only way to win. Eventually these people need to learn they are wrong and buy into Bitcoin.
They must never be given the opportunity to invest and grow  derivatives of the Bitcoin blockchain like sidechains.

with Bitcoin as is, a 1933 type Executive Order, would have little effect.

There is a world of difference between design intent and the development of the code. The changes you seem to weight in your response is focusing on the idea the code is what makes Bitcoin a viable design.
It's preserving the incentives in the design that make Bitcoin work the code is just one part of that design.

PS. Bitcoin's security is derived and managed by economics, the protocol is implemented as code a set of rules. 
Understanding and being able to write and change the protocol rules doesn't necessarily make for good economic.

I like the idea of mining hardware being smart property. 
Although the idea proposed was publicized by Blockstream employees I am not convinced they back it very strongly. I think the kill switch was an attempt at solving the other issue you mention by being able to control miners they decide are not legal. (Very low level thinking on there part)  
On the issues you draw attention too I am aligned with your perspective. nullc has also argued that your OP_RETURN data implementation in Bitcoin Core was for the embedded consensus in mastercoin, what's your take on that. I now little about mastercoin.

It's there in black and white, Blockstream want to implement SPV proofs that can be managed on the protocol level, (sidechains) this changes the incentive structure that makes Bitcoin. 
Proponents of sidechains say it makes it better, but no economic implication studies have been done and 3 of the most vocal Blockstream employees have told me there is no need and no president to even warrant considering such a study let alone having it peer reviewed.
No proof exist that side chains are good for Bitcoin, the counter argument is it's open so it's fair.
Opponents say changes to the incentives in Bitcoin allowed by sidechans will destroy it as block rewards diminish and corrupt the security inherent in the protocol today. And new and exotic financial instruments that will be tacked onto the Blockchain will cripple Bitcoin's full potential to become a reserve currency.
You're guilty of bla and attacking confused naive readers.

the opposition to increasing is week at best (little expression of understanding economic incentives at play in Bitcoin): 
Gmax: "We can't increase the block size limit because they'll be too many orphans."
Other: "But orphans are what drive the fee market -- naturally limiting the size of a block a rational miner will produce."
Gmax: "Orphaning is negligible. We can't expect orphans to drive fees." 
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:57:15
Another more practical way to think about it is it's only the blockchain, and bitcoin is just a measurement unit we use to prove how much of the blockchain is under your control.
Bitcoin works the same if the limit was 1BTC or 21M BTC.
The currency is only proof you have control of a percent of the blockchain.

It's important to distinguish between how miners choose to deal with the risk.

Yes you are correct if Bitcoin disappeared you would have nothing but meaningless numbers.
I'm not seeing evidence of transaction malleability other than the likes of Gox using outdated implementations of Bitcoin. But moreover to your point.
Assuming a Bitcoin COD transaction  In the case you exchange value for Bitcoin there are no liabilities between you and your trading partner.
When you get the BTC you are now part of the incentive structure that makes up the network. Those incentives are fundamental to your ability to store value in the Bitcoin network. 
You are dependant on the incentives remaining unchanged, not dependant on third parties.
Even you once you exchange value for Bitcoin are part of the network and play a critical role in maintaining the incentives.
Sell you coins for a subjective value and the incentives adjust.
You are dependent on the incentives in the protocol not the 3rd parties that also depend on the same incentives.  
In my view there are only 2 people in a Bitcoin transaction the person exchanging value who has trust in the incentives, and someone who is making a value judgment who once exchanged value because they speculated or believed in the Bitcoin incentives.

At the moment many big mining farms have to sell BTC to cover overhead and investor returns.
After block halving most miners will have to scale back operations, the ones who have planned well will survive.

This could trigger a price hike. Low supply dynamic.

It's not a direction chosen in a vacuum, Core rejects other code including BIP101, that's not how we weight chooses.
XT only has value as it contributes to the decentralization of centralized decision making and is a viable implementation of BIP101. 
It's not urgent as contentious as claimed. It is offered as a solution to be triggered next year (originally with 9 month to test and review.) It will also only trigger if there is 75% support.
With the above in mind it's low risk and has given lots of time to discuss and implement competing ideas.

Not really. But I see your point. 
Bitcoins are not liabilities like fiat, when you exchange value for Bitcoin - ie. the ability to say you control X% of the blockchain (or get x BTC) the transaction is direct. 
There is no intermediary in the Google definition of the word, when you get Bitcoin you control it it's an act of faith. If Bitcoin vanished you would still have your keys that control X% of the blockchain.
The Bitcoin network is a byproduct of the incentives, more a reflection of how many people value the ability to interact directly, than an intermediary that process transactions.
When you exchange value on the Bitcoin network you become part of it that is a direct relationship not one dependent of a third party like you think.

I realised the problem when I wanted to buy an offline computer from dell for my Armory wallet.
The solution I came up with was to have on open disk imaged of an OS that ran on a Pi dedicated to Bitcoin storage.
Even if you pay for the firmware you never give your address and the hardware is universal and standard.
The problem you identify is huge moving forward if Bitcoin reaches its potential.

I found one customized image however it wasn't executed to my satisfaction.
There are also a fiew concerns, the big one being entropy, all wallets being on the same hardware and the same OS, it would be theoretically possible to predict the wallet seed address.
For now Armory have an offline wallet that runs on the Pi it works well and you can backup multiple safe SD cards and get access to you're wallet on any Pi securely provided you follow simple protocols like not being online and stuff.
I did think of undertaking it myself the big demand for this solution will come when Bitcoin goes through the next growth stage and all those who have 1-10 BTC not secured very well start to look for a cost effective security solution.

We also need to define what it is about centralization that we want to avoid.
Centralization in general is not bad. It's the negative possibilities that could occur if certain types of features were centrally controlled.  
The goal in Bitcoin is not decentralization it's digital cash that's not under control of any specific type. Centralization can occur and we can still be free of central control.

Hardly without an outline of evidence, I've yet to read a convincing proposal or here a credible argument.
All these attacks depend on departing form the incentive system proposed by Satoshi.  They are mitigated when we gain understand and drop notions of progress to reduce block propagation risk as a fundamental improvement to Satoshis inept understanding.  
@_date: 2015-09-13 15:15:14
This is a big concern of mine too.
This was an important part of bigger block size debate we where discussing this when Thermos effective killed the discussion over on bitcointalk. 
I have always understand Satoshis design to work as Peter described it, I've been skeptical of Gavin IBLT as I felt it overlook the supply demand equilibrium that ensures market forces minimize block size.
Peter was discussing Shannon's law saying that so long as all miners were using the same network and the intonation communicated by IBLT represented was relatively smaller in the market equilibrium encouraging small blocks would hold.
I tend to agree but I need to better understand it befor I feel comfortable with the idea of implementing IBLT.

No! the CIA in my example above is actually the tightens of information in today's networking age. 
that have funded a company that employs most of the Core developers who maintain block size is part of the consensus layer and insist it needs to be centrally controlled, they maintain teh code that runs on 90% of nodes.  
and while we all agree what makes a valid transaction when we have 3 per second, they believe 50% of transactions should become invalid when we have 6 per second to prevent bitcoin from centralizing. 
they have a conflict of interest in that they are building a network of centralized servers that will benefit from those invalid transactions.

Thanks that's great. 
I'd totally agreed money shouldn't depend on trust in a third party. Where monew gets it's value is probably where I don't agree with Nick Szabo.
Bitcoin's $4B cap is made by the people who use it, it's not something someone directs and approves of.
The latest Nick Szabo video I found frustrating as Nick Szabo was implying Bitcoin shouldn't be money used for paying for things we haven't been able to use money for in the past.
He argued Bitcoin should be used as a reserve asset or a war hedge or a settlement layer for smart contracts. Coming from the perspective it's a cypherpunks ingestion and he is a cypherpunk.
While I agree with those applications I also agree with Nick Szabo criticism of Bitcoin that Satoshi designed to me money and not a smart contract settlement layer. I see that as Bitcoins strength not a weakness.
I am also for eliminating trusted third parties, however I see the first and second parties entering in a trusted business contract and the third party as something other. Creating a decentralized 3rd party may not be optimal, where trusted money may be.

The existing incentive system discourages this behavior. This type of behavior could give advantage to someone with over 50% of the hashing power but we already know this. 
If you don't like the way Bitcoin incentives are designed you need centralized control to change them.
I can already see you are advocating for some authority to define "legitimate" It's all just data and miners have an incentive to write that data to the blockchain. In exchange they then have a tiny incentive in the integrity of the data stored in the block chain. 
You're defining ways that undermine how the data is write to the blockchain that depend on no one noticing, and doesn't undermine the users of the network and at the same time demand for Bitcoin (more people joining the network) being a given.
All that depends on what is legitimate in your view.

who pays for the hashpower? 
is there better security with fewer users or more users? 
your logic is broken. 
in all circumstances users and transaction volume is not fixed or grandparent. reducing block size will have a negative pressure on users and transaction growth. 
bitcoin scales to secure the value stored on the blockchain. 
The value of Bitcoin is determined by the network effect of money. Best described by Metcalfe's law that states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2) which is well correlated with bitcoins market value and the number of transactions processed by the network. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:16:58

**I just want better money.** Reducing Bitcoin's money velocity to increase the value of the other properties that make Bitcoin better money will have a negative impact on the value that makes it better money.
If limiting block size is achieved by centralized control of the reference code to limit money velocity it's conceivable Bitcoin will not be better money.
It's market forces of supply and demand that should determine money velocity not some arbitrary limit imposed by central control.

that's not the correct framing, 10 seconds is not like 1.5 percent loss in revenue. 
10 seconds is like a 1.6% chance that 50% of the time some other miner of equal hashing power may find a block before you. Regardless of who finds the block the revenue goes to the miners who secure the network. 
As a user I just care that the financial intensive secures the network and all miners have the same incentive, not which miner is more profitable.  
it's a theoretical loss for one miner but it's not a loss for the effectiveness of miners profitability as a whole, no revenue is lost in the network if one miner is 1.6% less lucky that another.  
Matt Corrallo lacks macro and holistic understanding of the incentive design in the Bitcoin network.

Consensus in Bitcoin is already defined: it is an emergent property, objectively represented by the longest proof-of-work chain.
my reply above was to someone who was arguing that its the minority of users who are in control  (the miners) and the majority blindly follow suite.
I agree with you its not a democracy its better, its a set of voluntary rules governed by consensus.

True but central controlled coin will only have a marginal improvement on the existing system.
I'm saying it won't kill Bitcoin, and may even be good. The need to avoid centralized control is what will make Bitcoin work.

I estimate about 10,000 people invested in Bitcoin in any meaningful way.
I think how easy it would be to control and manipulate the actions of 10,000 Bittorent users.
1MB blocks today won't accommodate the millions of users needed to keep Bitcoin from centralizing in the hands of banks. To prevent KYC attack you need 10's of millions all over the world using Bitcoin. 
You need individuals helping each other for mutual benefits regardless of how TPTB define them. You're going the have security in large numbers. 1MB blocks will not allow enough users in the system that people can use to avoid Banking regulations and monopoly on money.

Tell me who is going to use a network where miners just relay blocks themselves amongst each other? 
lets say us 5000 nodes agree we only accept blocks that mine coins on an schedule that tops out at 21,000,000. 
and the 50 miners who have 50 nodes all have a cartel and agree to mine on a new schedule that tops out at 42,000,000 amongst themselves.

That using government subsidised electricity to grow isn't the myth. That using that electricity is a waste is the myth.  
You're corect in that the amount of energy per transaction is ridiculasly high, but thats not where the energy is being used. No one who uses the Bitcoin network payes for that electricity directly. Its being paid for with inflation an invisable tax no one sees.  
To say the energy is wasted is a subjective value judgment - no none is spending X energy per transaction, transactions are a byporodiut of how people choos to use the energy thay can controle. 
Saying its waistful is like saying people who buy expensive Teslas are wasting money. Or people who drive Teslas instead of cycling are wasting energy or people who cycle are wasting time. 
People spend energy where they see value, that's where the energy is going. 
you may not see the value thats OK.

I don't consider your faith in an exclusive centralized group working as a centralized authority on decentralizing control as a practical way to decentralize control, regardless of how competent they are at software development. 
It just sounds like you're advocating for more dependence on central authoritative control.   
I don't consider decentralization a goal in Bitcoin, the objective is to scale a value exchange protocol that can be trusted when you cant trust the participants. 
Decentralization is not the objective, its the idea of what decentralization provides that is a tool to to scale the value exchange protocol in a trust free way. 
centralized control is moving in the wrong direction, and decentralization is just one path (not the destination) and it looks different to many people.

I agree creative thinking and black hat brainstorming is how we find vulnerabilities in our security, but that not were security comes from, security is the ability to adapt to dynamically changing circumstances.  Big blocks that destroy the network are unlikely to have an impact, I cant imagine anyone sitting around saying lets let it happen. 
there are lots of chicken littles screaming the sky is falling - I'm just saying lets proceed with caution, it look safe if big block seem to be having an impact lets do something about it but it doesn't seem likely given the insensitive system that make Bitcoin work.  


Bitcoin is a dynamic system, its not a machine. If a exablock had to be injected into the system I'm confident there is enough dynamism in the system to circumvent any negative externalities that would have a lasting impact.

He is not advocating control over Bitcoin that is hyperbole. If anything he is advocating the Linus Torvalds and the Linux model of control over XT. 
I don't agree with that being a good model, but that doesn't make the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal  with 75% support a **hostile** coup attempt, or does it? .

If energy were 10x higher and unsubsidised, Bitcoin mining would not stop, miners would still make value judgments and use the energy in the most valuable and efficient way. The Bitcoin network would adjust. 
Bitcoin happens to be a well designed system impervious to inefficiency of State subsidies. It’s unfortunate that I don’t live in one of those states as I’d like to benefit from the subsidy.  
The truth is as much electricity as the State will throw at (or give), Bitcoin it will eat it up.
**Bitcoin is being subsidized though and the net result is an increased use of energy.** it’s just not in the way you think. 
Bitcoin is an experiment a well designed one and it’s too soon to tell if it’s going to succeed. The Subsidies that are consuming vast amount of energy are designed to be invested in infrastructure for future growth. 
The subsidies have to be big enough to encourage investment and optimized to scale without over investing, it just so happens that bitcoin investors pay the subsidies as a onetime trade off.
The Subsidy is a tax on the Bitcoin investors, most of them don’t believe in this tax but they happily pay it, with the promise that it is a once off tax. 
The subsidy that consumes vast amounts of electricity will diminish over time as the infrastructure is built out. That subsidy is the Block Reward given to miners as PoW, it is in fact Inflation in the money supply, a Tax every Bitcoin investor pays, and its diminished every 4 years and will eventually stop. 
Inflation in the money supply created wast (its how states like the Chinese indiscriminately pay for cheep electricity that is not optimally invested.) it just so happens in Bitcoin inflation is designed to use energy to grow and secure the network.

I have a few alts, I don't see them as a hedge against Bitcoin, I embraced the entrepreneurial spirit of their creators. Most are duds.
At the end of the day alts drive Bitcoin adoption. It's only Bitcoin adoption that counts. 
The innovation shift between Bitcoin and Fiat is quantum, the innovation shift between the most advanced 2.0 coin is just a fraction of the change that Bitcoin represents.
For all alts to succeeded we need Bitcoin to succeeded. And for Bitcoin to succeeded it just needs to be better money, IMO we don't need SideChains or  Blockchain 2.0 coins like Etherium.
Over a year ago I invested 3% of my Bitcoin holdings in alts I think my alt portfolio represents 1% of my holdings. 
There is money to be made with alts, I think during the next Bitcoin growth stage alts will grow much faster. During this I will be selling alts and buying bitcoin. When the hype stops I hope to be 100% bitcoin.

Just to clear up any misunderstanding lower transaction volume can be caused by high transaction fees that is the result of limited block space. Higher transaction fees are therefore a result of increased usage.
Increase usage is partly a result of lower transaction costs.
Given Bitcoin by design subsidies transaction cost to the tune of about 97-100% by inflating the money supply with a subsidy of 25BTC every 10 min as an incentive to increase transaction volume in order to reduce transaction cost.
Would you agree that limiting the block size has a causal relationship to depressing the price of Bitcoin and discouraging growth?

Program away with Bitcoin the programmable money there's already an amazing set of tools in there.

the risk is universal to all, so attacks that use hash power are subject to the same orphan risk or criteria for orphan risk.  Ones miners orphan is another miners good luck. 
I agree if orphans were eliminated there could passably be an effective 1.6% more overall hashing power, but at the expense of the incentives that encourage miners to mine small blocks and a higher profit for larger miners, the net effect could very likely be negative for bitcoin security. 
So I don't agree when you say "orphans do not help secure the network". Orphan risk plays a positive role in optimizing incentives that secure the network, weather 1.6% is effective too high or too low I cant say.  But the risk has to be real with actual orphaned blocks otherwise miners won't optimize to mitigate it. so they most likely do have a positive role in securing the network as they convey information about the health and capacity of the network of nodes.  
@_date: 2015-03-21 05:08:15
The scenario you describe, is the one that concerns me the most. Bitcoin as it is now is resistant and will survive just like bittorrent survives the same attack.
But if sidechains are implemented coupled with a government sanctioned edict like you propose we could see a situation like the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 where Bitcoin must be converted to an inflation sidechain goveCoin by a specific deadline and thereafter be converted at an ever diminishing rate governed by the Bitcoin protocol. 
That will eat Bitcoin for breakfast, that said sidechains aren't reality yet and the upside risk in favour of Bitcoin is huge.

I'd have a problem because no one would agree on what the "well being" of the plant is.

If we can't tell the difference between genuine use and an attack how much of a concern is it? Bitcoin needs to scale, fear that it's going to be used and building precarious to prevent it doesn't seem like a viable strategy.
Miners hold the antidote to large scale usage they just up the tx fees to increase propagation time. If it is impractical for miners to charge per Bite and coin age on a scale from 0 to infinite this is where development focus should be.
We don't need a centralized control system like the FED to increase fee for them.
I agree we need all the benefits that are offered by decentralization. I just don't see how we get node diversity when 90% of nodes run the same centralized code base.

I see no need for off chain solutions during the high growth stage.
Bitcoin is a junkster position of incentives, right now users are paying for security by accepting inflation. Miners are subsidizing transaction security by accepting the inflation subsidies. 
We need economics of scale to secure the transactions that get written to the blockchain. Not higher fees.
The demand for Bitcoin is a subjective value judgment. It is not constant or a given. 
Security scales to the value stored on the blockchain lightning can only succeeded when it can leverage the blockchain security.
Messing with money velocity to increase transaction fees will impact demand for Bitcoin. It's wrong to force it now while we are paying for subsidized growthwith inflation.

The fact most developers think this is a good idea is concerning it shows they don't understand the incentive system Satoshi designed.

Your are mistaken.
Bitcoin is designed so that you can't build a block without knowing the previous block.  You don't know that until the new block is finished propagating. (**this is a design feature not a problem**) 
The fact above was inherent in the design proposed in 2008.
Matt Corallo's Relay Network, was proposed in 2014. it is a system that circumvents that design feature. 
Ghash.io was the first to leverage this hack to gain a competitive advantage, this design feature is a problem only if you want added profit and you dont accept the bitcoin design as it was in 2013.
The fact that some Core Developers embraced this is problematic it shows a lack of understanding of how the incentive system works.  A relay network allows miners to validate block between themselves before they propagate this is a hack that gives miners more power than Bitcoin was originally designed to do.  
@_date: 2015-10-17 05:59:20

The subsidiary will be reduced over time and transaction fees will scale to reflect the value transferred over the network.

To say Energy is wasted is a subjective value judgment, it's like saying people who buy expensive Teslas are wasting money. Or people who drive Teslas instead of cycling are wasting energy or people who cycle are wasting time.
 The energy spent mining is not wasted. Bitcoin can actually be seen as a way of save energy.
In sustainable systems waste is food.  Our fractional reserve fiat based growth economy is a simplified and rudimentary ecosystem, it's unsustainable and wasteful in that it’s designed to growth for growths sake. 
Bitcoin on the other hand is designed to use energy as an economic input, the same fundamental unit used to make and do everything. (Everything)
Bitcoin Mining just seems wasteful at this time when you look at the energy cost per transaction in comparison to fiat. If you think about it a little, the energy being invested in Bitcoin is actually securing a network for vale exchange at a time when it's small and vulnerable. It's the egg, in the chicken and egg scenario of building a secure global value exchange network with just a few paying users. 
The current fiat Inflation economy has distorted the cost of energy so much that it is practical to burn it just to go to and from work, or to visit a friend. Bitcoin puts this abundant energy to good use, it's being used to secure the new value exchange network and as the demand for energy increases the networks need for it diminish every 4 years with halving.
The more valuable energy becomes the more it's used efficiently, and with sound money, resources will be allocated more effectively in a free market economy. Bitcoins going to give us both and bring about an environmental renascence as much as economic one.

I agree with this in part, while users subsidize miners with inflation (block reward) free can always be an option.

It's the development environment that's a concern BIP 65 is not a market or Bitcoin conscious change. It's not a change people can choose to run or not.
I'm fine with company's like Blockstream developing a business that takes advantage of such changes so long as Bitcoin nodes are decentralized from central control. 
Where I see need for concern is, when Bitcoin is considered to be strictly a developers project consisting of a reference implementation and a coding project run by its programmers. 
When in fact Bitcoin is a value exchange protocol governed by an arrangement of incentives.
Modification to the computer code is not governed by the incentives that run Bitcoin. 
Changes to the code that governs Bitcoin is governed by developers, some of whom think the incentiv system designed by Satoshi is fundamentally flawed and needs to be changed by changing the code that governs the protocol of incentives. 
I'm expressing a need to decentralizes the development of the code that governs the value exchange protocol. If we had 5 or 6 versions of the implementation code that ran the Bitcoin protocol corporate interest would not be in a position to influence the code base.
Say BIP 65 was only supported by 30% of the nodes and 25% of miners on the network, would it still be considered a core function of Bitcoin? 
Here is a hypothetical scenario say BIP65 turned out to be harmless on it's own but in combination with some other soft fork it was launch a competitive value exchange network that was poised to become orders of magnitude more successful than Bitcoin. And the core developers of Core (the 90% dominant reference client) had an invested interest in the success of this new protocol and little invested interest in the success of Bitcoin.
Would they pull the plug and remove BIP 65 before it drained value from Bitcoin or do you think they'd take their chances?
Given that a large majority of developers in the Bitcoin space have expressed an opinion that the incentives that govern the Bitcoin value exchange protocol are wrong or dysfunctional and that the code needs to be fixed because there is too much ignorance in the general Bitcoin community I'm highly skeptical.
I'm not taking into consideration past contributions when I call out Peter Adam Greg and many of their cohort. But they are in that group of people who publicly express such opinions on Satoshis Bitcoin and they're fixing it for us and need to prevent fracturing of the central control of the reference code base to do it.
I'm opposed to unjustifiable ignorance.

@_date: 2015-11-05 23:52:28
I agree we all need to agree on the consensus rule set. 
I don't believe the node count will diminish until it's small enough to control by a single entity in the future when blocks are 32MB or something. If we allow block size to increase to 32MB, economies of scale will ensure that enough entities have an interest in maintaining an independent blockchain node to avoid centralization. 
Bitcoin's market cap will be huge in that instant and while 100 tx/s is no visa payment system it will make a viable settlement layer and afford opportunities for 2nd layer solutions like Lightening.  
I can't say the same if there is homogenized, centrally controlled code running on the majority of nodes.  in this scenario Bitcoin is centralized - we are already here. 
What makes a valid transaction should be a set of rules that is not limited by a transaction number. 
We all agree what makes a valid transaction when we have 3 per second, **why should 50% of transactions become invalid when we have 6 per second?** it's up to the miner to decide if the transaction is worth their effort to include it in a block and charge accordingly.
block size is not part of the consensus rules it's a function of block propagation as determined by the capability of functioning nodes - its a technological constraint, and miners have to respect it or they will be orphaned and see - OP for $414,720.00 I'll make god dam sure I have a block that's optimized to propagate among nodes as efficiently as possible for that type of cash.

How can it be "just a relay network" for propagating blocks faster it it invalidated the need for a network of nodes to choose the longest chain and lets miners decide among themselves?

Given Miners are subsidized with 25BTC every 10 min why do you think it would be good to artificially allow the miners to benefit from market reaction (increase fees) due to a restricted money velocity? 
I'd think low fees are imperative to Bitcoin adoption, and generating economics of scale to increase fees and keep individual transaction costs down as the 25BTC block subsidies diminish.
You’re suggesting we limiting block size (money velocity) to maintain a competitive mining market and secure network. 
MV=PT we know M is fixed so you suggesting we manipulate V to push up fees. Thant’s a very Keynesian idea to limit V, or keep Money Velocity constant. 
Why do you think Satoshi scaling solution that is inherent in the design is effective? That being making large blocks increases the miner’s risk of being orphaned and therefore miners are incentivized to make small blocks. I like to understand why Satoshi was wrong and why we need to change this? 
The way I understand an attack is by flooding the market with transactions. The way to prevent the attack is to charge a fee based on the size of the transaction. 
When I look at the attacks to date, who has benefited? (it seems the small block proponents) 
  
With a larger block size a spam attack would not be able to push up the fee. (Not until a miner chose to increase it. That is unlikely now as miners are subsidies between 77-100% to include transactions, the only risk being orphaning.) 
No matter how much the attacker spent, miners would just take what they see as viable transactions that can be processed without risk of orphaning and collect the fee, they’d learn pretty quickly what the max size a block can be before they lose.    
By contrast with a smaller block size, the result is, limited transactions so a Spam attack just needs enough paying transactions spam to fill the block before the fees start increasing. 
The total cost to increase the transaction fee is set by the block limit and existing transaction volume. 
as opposed to 
In an unlimited block size cost to increase the transaction fee by spamming the network is set by existing transaction volume, and the max block size a miner can write to the blockchain without risk of being orphaned. 
As you can see an unlimited block size is naturally limited by miners for the benefit of the whole network by making spam attacks more expensive and keeping transaction costs down.

What is at risk is the value the private keys represent and understanding where that value comes from and how it is derived is at the heart of this debate.
I see centralization of development as a risk. If the Core developers had demonstrated great economic insight and understanding as to the understanding of where and why Bitcoin has value, this issue would have gone unnoticed.
They have demonstrated great ability to develop effective code, I'd go so far as to say they see code as the mechanism by which the protocol is enforced, putting it above the economic principles that give Bitcoin it's value.  
It's concerning to me that they have not expressed understanding of Bitcoin primarily being an economic protocol for value exchange. 
Going so far as to change Bitcoin to allow them to build other value exchange protocols that undermine the economic protocol that gives Bitcoin value.

Yip Core developers have some fixing to do. It looks like Relay Network deviate from the design intent in Bitcoin, if nodes don't confirm among themselves which blocks are valid and the block order then, yip your right miners run the system. 
This is a great example of how developers encourage development in a direction that breaks the bitcoin intensive system. it illustrates there lack of understanding of what makes bitcoin a robust system. 
Sending empty block is a huge problem too.

More to the point why would people use Bitcoin if the transaction cost was $5 and up per 300 bytes. 0.02BTC.
 If BTC was worth $1000 again that would be a minimum of $20 for a minimum transaction fee.
Why invest in Bitcoin at all. 
Bigger blocks = more transactions and more transaction is a result of more users.
@_date: 2015-10-17 16:58:35
Transaction processing costs are between 97-100% subsidized by miners and storage 100% subsidized by nodes.
So **cheep** is not a choice it's a design features at this point in time, so while block subsidies are high transaction costs are subsidized by users accepting inflation. 
Current Core developers are trying to maintain a reference code base that is like the 1 ring to rule them all. They want more nodes by reducing transaction volume to create decentralization. 
Understanding what decentralization means is important. We want to avoid central control. Decentralization does not happen when we get more nodes when 90% of them run a centrally controlled code base. 
You're also framing the choices **secure and irreversible** are not a results of cheap, fast and decentralized yet it's more important as a choice.
So the options you've proposed even if I picked all 3 would not guarantee Bitcoins success. Those are not choices you need to make the Bitcoin design is not broken they were dealt with when the first implementation was released.  
My real question is still important, do you think Bitcoin is broken, inefficient or dysfunctional in accommodating an increase in transaction volume on the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-11-17 21:32:41
I'm too lazy to find the video or audio interview. I'll take it back as soon as you agree or advocate that more implementations of Bitcoin make the Bitcoin protocol more secure and resilient to change. And Core should not have the primary development development role.

@_date: 2015-10-17 21:40:58
I may have misunderstood, I see the problem being that miners can actually mine empty blocks as a much bigger problem. They're not processing transactions. They don't need a limit on the transactions they process, the risk of orphans does that well enough.
I also think it's bad form to rely on central controle to set the minimum fee like the FED setting interest rates.
The mechanism is inherent in the design lets use it test it coming up with reasons it's broken or won't work in the absence of evidence is wrong.

fear, it's one of the easiest emotions to conger up. 
and 
The empathy with being hated without just cause. Another powerful meme. 
Truth is we are not born hating, it's something you need to earn.
It's Ironic but Bitcoin turns the power motive on its head, when someones wealth (the instrument of power) is locked in the block chain, when they die, the value goes to everyone not the perpetrator of the murder. 
this seen does injustice to the system of decentralized freedom. its actually an opportunity to grow so well done.

Serving old blocks to new clients isn't an issue, it's not what uses up the available network resources as it's a once off cost. (like a capital cost in a business - the variable costs need to remain potentially unlimited to facilitate growth.) 
How does max upload bandwidth as set by -maxuploadtarget guarantee that available bandwidth won't limit a the demand for the greater Bitcoin Network bandwidth when the node is not able to viably provide the necessary relays? 
limiting node bandwidth is akin to limiting transaction capacity in the big picture. 
I'd rather Luke-Jr stopped hosting a Bitcoin node if he cant afford the bandwidth cost needed to cater to the growing need of the Bitcoin Economy and make VOIP callas at the same time.

We fork every day a block gets orphaned.
If we derive value form the number of economic actors using the economic system the value is derived from the value in the network connections. 
It's worth thinking about, because forks happen. It's just forks are by default accepted by the majority.
Forks that require the majority to make a conscious choice are not destructive. They are in reality as benign as forks af orphaned blocks. 
They required conscious choice because they can change the rules of the game. The fact that one network will have the majority of users preserves the value. It's very likely over time this utility in value will result in a single dominant network and a typically orphaned other.
The subversive forks are the ones developers make where you have no choice but to accept. 
Bigger blocks will help protect from subversive forks. (subversive forks  been give a nice and acceptable sounding name "soft forks")
The reason the nodes in that image should not be considered decentralized is because they are decentralized in location only. They run a harmonious code base controlled by a centralized handful of developers.

While transaction fees are ~97-99% subsidized by inflation (the block reward) . That inflation subsidizing security. Transaction fees will have little to no impact on block size. 
Controlling transaction fees at this point will impact growth and adoption.
The current subsidized cost per Bite is ~0.02 BTC. Users of Bitcoin are paying the fee through inflation (block rewards given to miners) 
So given the subsidized nature of transaction costs we should not see it impact block size until the subsidy falls from dominating the cost maybe somewhere below a 50% subsidy.

We're on the same team, I'm a big Degrowth proponent (but for the opposition to free market part) I work to reduce industrial waste by optimizing consumer products and the environmental impact through LCA as well as optimizing productions systems for Eco and economic efficiency.  
We disagree on the definition of waste, I'm not going to try and change it it's something you have to understand from an ecological systems perspective. We both agree it’s bad.   
 
The efforts you describe in you post are efficiency improvements, they don’t reduce waste they create efficiency and may even contribute to produce more waste read [Jevons paradox]( 
Bitcoin Energy consumption is not waste, the energy consumed cannot be reduced with efficiency in mining, the energy used in bitcoin is converted into an irreversible digital asset. There is no more efficient way to do it. 
The energy that will be consumed in Bitcoin is predetermined. It’s a function of the relative Value ascribed to Bitcoin and the Block Halving every 4 years.   Efficiency in the service of PoW just determine who gets to benefit from said efficiency, it has no effect on the amount of energy used in a free market.

Unlimited is not an option, neither is free. 
There is going to be a trade off as block space has a cost. 
1. Miners pay with a higher orphan risk if they make bigger blocks.
2. Nodes pay for space and bandwidth.
The real question is who pays for the decentralized blockchain space and bandwidth? (Hint it's not the miners.)
How you answer that is, who benefits from paying to maintain the blockchain integrity and who benefits from a global value exchange ledger.
With no disruption in financial markets I can see thousands of competing entities that would benefit from hosting nodes with much higher transaction volume .
What has prevented block size growth up untill now? (Hint it's not the existing limit)

If there is no benefit, say you don't want the heat or the time you save turning it on is undesirable then yes it's waste and its bad. you'll need to turn it off to reduce the waste. Otherwise its just a cost v benefit trade off.

Security is subsidized by Bitcoin inflation. We pay for it in 25BTC chunks every 10 minutes and it's going to diminish - it needs to be distributed over many more transactions if it's going to be adequate. 
If we limit transaction volume to fit in a 1MB block and want the same security we have now in the future we'll need to spend ~0.02BTC per transaction regardless of the Bitcoin Value.

It seem logical to me the way u/procabiak measure consensus is flawed or irrelevant.
The old chain is not left behind. In the case of XT we're talking about the implementation of BIP 101.
It is not true that "XT has no consideration about the old chain". (I presume that means if BIP 101 is implemented as an accepted improvement.) To the contrary Bitcoin and whatever implementation supports it is 100% dependent on the blockchain.
The facts we know are all in all circumstances dependent on assumption of relative acceptance. The fact that Bitcoin is depend on the blockchain is nothing more than my assumption I hold to be true.
If your facts lead to the conclusion we need centralized control you're weighing them in a way I consider inappropriate or you holding certain ideologies as dogmas.
Likewise if you believe we need a mechanism of 95/5 acceptance for permission to improve Bitcoin or need consciences among a centralized group of developers. I understand enough to know you're wrong.

You're probably right, I'm just reacting to this guy:
Who talks like Bitcoin is a we invention like he is part owner of the idea - compares it as an equal to some other failed ideas.
Sights a number of typically applications for Bitcoin and then overlooks why it may be used reserve currency. But pushed the idea that general folk are nickel and diming Bitcoin to mediocrity. Recommending everyday people don't use it as money.
He says Bitcoin was designed to be money first and foremost and launches off punting etherium concluding that Bitcoin is a settlement layer for global payments overlooks it as electronic cash it was designed to be.
Thinks putting financial assets into Bitcoin and becoming more like etherium is the future. Implying Bitcoin should evolve that way - not be every day money for people but more a corporate asset for governments and multinationals. No thanks Bitcoin doesn't need any of that to be successful. It just needs to be better money used by everyone to become the underlying reserve currency.   
I have nothing against that go do it! Just lets get better money working before we go messing with changing the incentives that make Bitcoin Bitcoin and adding sidechains and all.

Bitcoin speculators and holders in the free market perform the same function of the Central Bank, but in a decentralized way. When they are effective we have price stability.
Price inflation and deflation are then economic indicators as understood by the writings of ludwig von mises Friedrich Hayek.
We expect huge unprecedented growth in Bitcoin and therefore unprecedented deflation, one that could only be stopped with money inflation so the decentralized "FED" of users are expected to manage the money supply and project that growth curve.
Problem is some small blockists want both money velocity and money supply to be limited.

It's only viable so long as the block size is limited, this favors big miners and gives advantage to users for using their servers. This is how centralized services become more profitable and huge conglomerates form.

it seems to me only people with a vested interest in the success of Bitcoin will be interested in running a node, and in the future if it goes up in value that could include people who hold as many as 1 BTC.
Running a node is like keeping a copy of a P2P contract - you do it because you want a record agreed by all that you control X - BTC

@_date: 2015-10-18 16:11:42
I agree. I'm just saying if it costs $20 in today value to use the blockchain it may not be adopted.
If I think about it in the fiat world I pay between $2 and $40 to send value anyway in the world. If I treat fiat as a hot potato the inflation tax is irrelevant. 
If Bitcoin fees had to sustain the existing security at a value of around $2000 we'd need to pay about $40 for a 300 byte transaction and an average of $80 per translation.
As a user of value exchange networks that not appealing to me new users even banks wouldn't touch it when they realize (it's not about blockchains but decentralized self secured money ledgers) notej network security is derived from transaction volume.

We've never had a limit on total coins and transaction volume.
That's never ever happened in bitcoin history. Level limited supply and limited transaction volume to alts it's bad science to change an experiments parameters, midway through.

Many wallets can use a node. To have a node broadcast your transactions it must comply with the protocol, so there is little incentive to hack it, as it will be useless if it isn't compliment.
Hacking wallets on the other hand is another story there are many vectors for attacks.
If your primary wallet is also your node the number of attack vectors could be optimized as you are broadcasting your software version your IP your OS. 
So I feel running my node and my wallet on different systems is ideal.
But I like the OP idea my first choose would be an IPKG package for a NAS like the Qnap

I prefer an analogy of dedicated hashing computers (ASIC's) maintain and securing  the network and in return reworded with the transaction fees and a block payment that halves approximately every 4 years. This service is also known as mining.

Remember we talking Bitcoin and it is voluntary. In economics, Deflation = more purchasing power - goods and services are falling in price, so you can always buy what you need, you just choose to save. 
You can always stick with your inflating Fiat if you want, no need to use Bitcoin if you don't like the Austrian Business cycle or Deflation.   
Fewer goods and services to divide across the same population = scarcity, scarcity in a free market results in Price Inflation the law of Supply and demand. 
The transition from inflation economics to sustainable economics will be met with temporary unemployment, while all the people who have jobs that destroy the planet - ( making goods and services the free market doesn't want,) find new ways to make a living, the flip side is higher employment forced through the "Keynesian economic growth model of More"  = i.e. environmental destruction and eventual collapse.

You owe 20% income tax in fiat $20 (see 2.2)
You then sell 1XBT when the price crashes to pay the tax. - market price is $10
You can't claim the capital gains loss so you are in debt for $10 in tax with no income.

The truth is while XBT increases in value it is too valuable to spend.

Using the velocity of money theory to ascertain a value on Bitcoin as spent in the Bitcoin economy yields a value around $2-4.

You invest in it by supporting the idea.
The idea of Bitcoin is strengthened by the amount of wealth transferred through it. (Wealth is held by members of the P2P network not in the Bitcoin themselves)
The more wealth that exchange hands the more stable the network.
Bitcoin's design ensures you can't manipulate the the units used to represent the wealth without actually transferring your wealth to ananother member in the P2P network.
The network has value because you can use it for voluntarily trade within the network. It can't be extinguished because of its decentralization. (So long as there are participants the network exists.) 
Given the voluntary nature its strength is in the amount of wealth that participants  moves through it. 
The opportunity you are contemplating is can government control the participants (delay adoption / stop adoption) with regulation if you send your hard earned wealth through the system, while trusting other P2P participants to do the same.
Governments can regulate at the interfacing between fiat and Bitcoin, but once you're in it is regulated by P2P.

Sure anyone can innovate see @ 6:30 Productivity Growth is confused with GDP growth.
 Productivity Growth is actually just that! Doing more with less, using innovation and inventiveness to be more productive. By default in an economy driven by Productivity Growth GDP could be declining while at the same time the standard of living could be improving, this would be innovation driven deflation. Managing the GDP through the debt cycle thinking it is creating productive growth is well naive to say the least. The net result is endless growth in a finite world, inevitable default.

Looking at this argument another way, deferred consumption "savings" is what made civilisation, it provided excess and encouraged corporative trade. 
Looking at the benefits of making credit viable by inflating the money supply. Accelerated consumption is rewarded, the net result is overconsumption. 
The evidence of the problem is visible in accelerating consumption of the decreasing recourses in our finite plaint.
The Economic growth model managed through Monetarist policy will end in a collapse not because of Bitcoin, but because perpetual growth is unsustainable and out of balance. 
A system like Bitcoin is just an opportunity for voluntary change before the exponential growth model hits the limits of a finite planet.

In the 1950's consumer tech. Was supposed to create the 3 day work week. Washing machines, telephones dishwashers, automobiles, mass produced everything was supposed to save us time.
But today you have to work longer hours than those who never had the convenience of buying cheep bread or using a washing machine. 
Why because of inflation you earn pre inflation and spend post inflation. The result is wealth moves up and you have to work more, all seems well on the surface but it is like voluntary slavery.
Given your savings lose value the cycle repeats and you need to work more, so in effect the meme of a fair trade using a fixed unit of measure for wealth is sound. But should the unit of measure be manipulated, it in effect is used to control your productivity without the need of a gun or a will.

If I assess my purchasing power objectivity from city of residents.
$50K 12 years ago - I could buy a $80K raw apparent. Today it costs +$400K 
The Bank would have given me $6K in interest. 
Property would be better than cash. (Purchasing power almost down everywhere except where I invested.) 
I bought a 3D printer being in 3D design 50% down and 50% at 4% interests over 2 years -  $50K, business plan looked promising, in  reality ROI was 7 years it cost more in office space and labour than it generated in revenue. Today it costs $3K to replace. 
All in all cash was the worst place to keep my money. $50 K today is the overdraft space on my credit card. I can't even get a deposit on an apartment with it.

I had the same concerns as the OP, still considered the wealth transfer possibly more perverse than wealth distribution of today.
Bitcoin unlike the system today can't be influenced by those with the ability to create money, so there power will fail over time, as saving erodes there wealth of the early adopters. 
Still I think Bitcoin is more a finite digital commodity than a currency given it's current speculative value. As a currency it's value would be determined by measuring GDP and the velocity of money, it would be at least 2 or 3 orders of magnitude less. 
So it is possible it could be a giant ponzi or a new asset class that defaults as currency.

Thanks for pointing that out.
But I disagree debt and fiat base money (a base money that is not a commodity or PM) are both inflationary.
I see Bank debt is not 1:1 based debt it is managed debt through fractional reserve banking. While it may be temporary it is repeated perpetually thus increasing the total money supply causing inflation.
Increasing the fiat money base is also inflation causing. Base money invested in treasury bills is taken out of circulation and is not inflationary but the internet paid on those bonds is inflationary. Furthermore banks deposits with the Central Bank allow an increase in FRB and that is inflationary.

You can even use it to avoid the use of conscription (forcing military service) by taking the wealth from the poor and offering them a position in the military to help stabilize other uncontrollable victims (who have nothing left to lose but there own lives.)
Bitcoin on the other hand is Superman's kryptonite, to the Banks, it is highly volatile and unstable and when enough voluntary wealth is transferred through Bitcoin it will become stable and can be used to destroy the manipulators of the units of measure of wealth, replacing it with one that can't be manipulated (it can, but only once by relinquishing one's power / wealth.)

I don't worry much about what people say, it's more what they do. 
Poor people need to save money to enable opportunities, money inflation erodes those savings. Poor people can't afford to pay a higher price for goods and services, as they need to save, the delay in spending causes them to pay a higher price than the rich when you have money inflation. 
You can't give the poor wealth they have to learn to make it. But stealing there wealth through inflation costs the poor much more than the wealthy.

Once you access the coins on the paper wallet send the change to a new paper wallet.
It is safe to add funds as you go to a paper wallet (using it like a savings account.)
When you withdraw them the change (the Bitcoin you don't spend) goes to a change address. If you are not 100% sure you know what this implies you can lose all the in spent Bitcoin.

It appears a viable alternative to inflammatory currency is one with a fixed quantity, where the market responds to a shrinking economy output with inflated prices and an over productive one with deflation. And when currency units are lost they represent goods and services already contributed to the economy, not future debt, that is extinguished. 
If you think Bitcoin is deflationary when in fact it is inflating faster relative to fiat currency, and ultimately winds up in a deflationary spiritual you are blinded by your own understanding.
If you don't grow and learn, you will be left behind and miss the opportunity of a lifetime.
Still a fixed currency can now be voluntarily adopted, while you misguided insight sees it as deflationary, being forced to use inflammatory currently is no longer guaranteed.
Obviously the PTB will insist you should use the existing inflation based currency because it is to there benefit, your choice no point to having this conversation.

Your response is perpetuating an untruth.


An increase in the money supply temporary or temporarily repeated indefinitely will increase (inflate) the money supply and thus cause inflation.
An increase in the money supply (even temporarily) will via the Cantillon Effect cause wealth to move from those who have first access to the temporary new money from those who earn it last.
This indirect transfer of wealth is what is referred to as theft, it is perpetrated only because of ignorance and in part by free banking librarians who push your narrative.

I agree with you so there is still no justification to increase the money supply.  
Good point, if economies expand not in size, but in quality, that wouldn't weaken the Austrian Economic model. 
But it isn't consistent with my observations. Here is an interesting read,
Edit, increasing the money supply stimulates investment in production (invest before inflation and profit afterwards) this is the cause of the growth in the economy today.  
As the 99% you have to earn pre inflation and consume post inflation, this is the cause of the Economic inequality the cause is known as the Cantillon Effect.

This has been discussed quite a lot over at bitcointalk.org 
You will be surprised to know the environmental cost of making Paper Fiat is still higher than the Bitcoin network, along with comparable data centers; the problem is if the inefficiencies in Bitcoin scale linearly to comparable sizes as current monetary systems, the potential environmental cost will be huge.  
That said, do call the heat that keeps you warm this winter waste heat? And if the heat generated by mining Bitcoin's keeps you warm it would not be waste but a new layer of efficiency. 
The waste heat is a potential for a new input for a new emerging market of heat sequestration.

Store of wealth is valid but still dependent on speculation.
The other points had nothing to do with me wanting to know why I should be interested.

I'd like to correct some assumptions.


A crash is a correction a fundamental change in the status quo. All intelligent life on earth owes its existence to a crash in the status quo. With CB's there are winners and losers, a crash is a sift in power. You just advocate for keeping the existing power structure.


Deferred consumption is a form of saving. Every one has needs, they will be spent. Our civilization evolved purely because we defer consumption.
 &gt; When it comes to currencies, people want something stable.
I want something honest, not stable. Entrepreneurs, fulfill need, stability reflects there are no needs.  (We have huge needs that are not supported but your definition of stability - environment and wealth inequality to name a few.


Normal = average not the top 20% that live in the West but the 80% who are victims of the IBS policy and resulting credit ratings 
all I want is to preserve my wealth. I agree Bitcoin isn't a currency, but the stable alternatives you recommend require perpetual growth (they are not savings - differed consumption)  they owe there existence to credit and an expanding money supply. Ultimately they destroy natural capital that is the earth.


Bitcoin is 100% traceable - cash is the medium of choice for criminals.  
The irrevocable nature of Bitcoin requires rule of law, it puts the responsible of the suppliers to be honest and manage there reputation. Consumer protection by legality  ensures resources are a property of government, not the money.

The loss Risk is less than 10%, you get a fiat inflation deduction on the purchasing power. 
So your net risk if you invest 10% of savings is ± 5%. Of loss of total value in future purchasing :
EDIT: You can compound the inflation so as time goes on the risk of loss is reduced.

To the market being manipulated, by stake holders this is true.
You do not have to buy Bitcoin it is a voluntary choice, you also do not have to sell your Bitcoin for a lower value than you originally invested.
So if the manipulation is up you can benefit. 
The selling point over our existing system using fiat, is the manipulation is done with fractional reserve lending and when you make a mistake you just adjust the rules or use QE.
In Bitcoin you are not manipulating the system with other people's debt, and if you make a mistake you lose your Bitcoins.
Given you can erode wealth from the wealthy by saving in Bitcoin, and you can't in fiat in the long run the producers in an economy will win over the manipulators.

True, but there are companies like BitPay that will eliminate the risk so don't have to deal with the volatility.
Personal I don't see Bitcoin as a currency but more as a speculative store of wealth, a p2p distributed risk hedge. When all speculative value erodes it works like a currency. 
Also I meant to add (but the edit didn't save) that you shouldn't be investing more than you can afford to lose. And don't invest if you don't understand how this technology is revolutionary.
Still the manipulators can't win if you buy and hold or only cash out at a higher value.

Agree it's Keynesian, but know the Central Banks actually attempts to mitigate the business cycles by manipulating the money supply, I agree it's wrong (as in immoral) as this is the main cause of why business cycles exist, as Banks create them and in the attempt to mitigate them they create debt and inflation the cause of poverty via the Cantillon Effect.  
The movie is great except for the 2 underlying flaw in the Keynesian dogma. 
1) @ 3:50 Credit is described as an "asset" to the creditor, and a Liability to the Debtor. 
2) @ 6:30 Productivity Growth is confused with GDP growth.  
1) Financial "assets" are only assets to the elite ( the 1%) the benefactors of the debt cycle. 
for everyone else in society when you loan money (provide credit) you are at risk that the detour may default, and your money lost. (Thus a loan is always a liability never an asset, it is a liability to the detour and the creditor, getting it wrong is called malinvewstment and should result in the elimination of the money from the parties.)
2) Productivity Growth is actually just that! Doing more with less, using innovation and inventiveness to be more productive. By default in an economy driven by Productivity Growth GDP could be declining while at the same time the standard of living could be improving, this would be innovation driven deflation.  Managing the GDP through the debt cycle thinking it is creating productive growth is well naive to say the least. The net result is endless growth in a finite world, inevitable default.

I've been investing in BTC stocks since the exchanges popped up. I have had my Bitcoin stolen and most listed startups are amateurs and the investors are too.
90% go bust within a year. In deflationary economics you would do best to hold your capital. When Bitcoin price starts dropping we are in an inflation period, only then do you want to invest in company stocks. 
AM was one I thought was a pipe dream, it turns out they are one of the only original mining startup companies to follow through. And friedcat has proved to be very reliable and honest.
I hold both AM100 and HMF, I sold out 90% of my HMF when there ASICs arrived - effectively they will never get a ROI on there current hardware I would be lucky if I it goes up. I bought back a small position of AM100 when it hit .005 and I expect this one to shoot up in Feb March next year.

Thanks that's a great summary.

Look for hashing power per share. 
The price collapsed because investors realized HMF doesn't have the hashing power to sustain dividends.  (Divided is paid out of capital)
AM1 and AM100 collapsed because rising difficulty (although they have much higher hashing power per share) also AM are investing dividend in developing new hardware.
The increase in price of BTC in China = way more working capital than budget for. So I expect we will see high quality mining equipment in March next year. 
My guess is another big bubble in mining stock and AM will be much bigger than others.
AM and HMF are the only 2 I trust all in all Bitcoin is the investment mining funds are like investing in infrastructure. AM is developing while HMF is using.

Just thinking about it again.
 Mr. Falkvinge is having problems promoting Bitcoin because he has benefited so disproportionately. And believes new investors will be burned.  (
If I recall you were burned when you first invested.
That is how it works.

You would think so, with Vault of Satoshi launching. 
But there probably are lots of unclaimed funds at CaVirtex wafting for law enforcement to get a subpoena. In the meantime, according to their T of S they can help themselves before they hand it over.

I'm more impressed with you're persistence,
Hint: if it look like gold 2.0 and works like gold 2.0 Maybe it is.
I would like to understand your perspective. Not just read you inflammatory commentary.

Enjoying the read thanks forgot to mention that.
XBT is also the currency term used in place of BTC.

I'd think this is OTT, 
The Nobel Prise in Economics is not a Nobel prise as such but a prise funded by the Riksbanken a Central Bank and a long time member of the BIS 
These banks are the epitome of centralised banking and global Fiat and Bitcoin attacks them at the core of their very existence. 
It would be funny though, even possible, after all they did give Friedrich Hayek an endorsement when they used his theory's to privatise public assets and bust Labour Unions.

This is a bull as in bull market. ┗(°0°)┛ I think to the moon means up up and more up. 
As for Mars, it was recently discussed on Reddit that Bitcoin on Mars would be impractical given data only travels at the speed of light.

After the next step in difficulty the more efficient GPU miners will no longer be profitable.  Should the exchange stay constant!
All in all at this stage it is about recovering hardware cost, difficulty can increase quite a bit and price can fall before any sort of equilibrium draws near.

Austrian school is more like a science
Keynesian school is a social science (voodoo)

Still pretty low mining in a pool without a significant investment in ASICs.

The inconvenience of Bitcoin with the down side of Fiat inflation.
Otherwise I could see some using it.
@_date: 2013-05-31 22:52:24
I thought all ASICa were a scam.
I invested 10% in mining shares (lost it all effectively stolen)
40% mining equipment (2000% return)
40% in  BTC (300% return - I sold in 2012 and never got an opportunity to buy back in)

I laugh whenever I see someone estimate the value in fiat.
Best to stick to the nearest order of magnitude. In this case still one power off.

nuff said, inflation causes poverty


Just pointing out market dynamics, as self correcting in contrast to your implied Paradox of thrift.
Advocating for an economy that grows like a cancer to keep everyone employed consuming more exponentially is doomed to fail. We don't need more we need better. 
I'm not interested in proving you wrong as you seem to know it all, I'm just challenging your belief that inflation is viable, challenging your assumption that deflationary economics are not viable. 
Calling my insight wishful thinking and accusing me of confusing people is sad.  
Just explain how inflation benefits the masses, explain how economies and consumption can grow exponentially in a finite environment, and explain why you think monetary inflation doesn't bleed wealth from the bottom of the wealth pyramid to the top.

I bought a 1XBT Casascius coin for each of my kids and nieces and nephews.
I only intended to give it to them when they reached $100 in value - April caught me off guard. Well I have passed them on now that I think we have cleared $100.
My biggest regret each Bitcoin cost me 2.25 Bitcoin.

Not to mention with the KYC verification and Bitcoin's tracking ability it is far from anonymous.
