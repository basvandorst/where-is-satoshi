Why are you in such a rush to use Uncle Sam's street lights, roads, national security, ability to recall 200 million eggs before they get you sick, etc etc etc. If you have such a hard on for not paying any taxes, then maybe you should stock up on meth and move to southern Oregon and see how that works out for you. 
I'll just pay my taxes. Like an adult.

This is exactly what Kraken has done to me. Well, I did verify but they don't like my photo and now refuse to do anything else to give me my money back. It's been SIX MONTHS now.

I escalated my ticket months ago. I'm still waiting. Today is day 113 that I have been unable to access my account or withdraw my money. 
How long is too long?
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:00:00
116 days and counting. Still waiting for you to let me withdraw my money. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:04:06
I'm still waiting on your reply. 114 days and counting since I've had access to my money.

I really wish I knew what detail I was forgetting. I just want my money back and 113 days seems a bit extreme to me.

I opened my ticket 113 days ago and escalated it months ago. How much longer do you think it will be until I can withdraw my money?
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:25:30
I've been waiting 113 days and counting for access to my account and funds. I guess I wanted MY MONEY back so badly that all of Kraken's so called "support" just stopped responding to me. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:15:17
Do you have time to work on my ticket now? Open for 113 days. I'd really like to withdraw my funds and get as far away from Kraken as possible.

People should also check out  on Twitter (that is, if Kraken didn't cry to Twitter to have that person's account suspended for letting customers know how they could file complaints with the government) and see for themselves how many "horror stories" people report in trying to get any sort of support from Kraken. 
People can listen to Kraken's customers, or they can just blindly listen to Kraken.

Kraken will NOT be subject to lawsuits, not until the government changes the laws. Read the Terms of Service and you'll see that Kraken is terrified of being held accountable through the courts and so have inserted a mandatory arbitration clause. There are bills in Congress right now trying to outlaw this practice because of the egregious customer service abuses it has given rise to. Kraken has used this to exploit a near total lack of accountability. But the winds of change are beginning to blow. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:38:46
Kraken almost certainly has been using their staff or others that they have hired to come into social media and post favorable reviews and defend the company's notoriously awful support team. Anyone defending a so called "support" staff that takes months to get around to tickets, that comes on social media and outright lies, and that acts like royalty should be highly suspect.

For Jesse Powell to call anyone else entitled and disrespectful is just an outrageous example of hypocrisy. King Kraken does nothing but demand that their customers bow down (or bend over) and submit. The most disgusting company I have ever dealt with and when the CFPB does away with mandatory arbitration for companies like Kraken that get away with scamming customers, I will be at the courthouse steps with an ear to ear smile, ready to see Kraken finally be held accountable for their customer service abuses.

Joining Kraken is the most regretful decision I've made in many years. Check out the subreddit to get an idea of what dealing with them is like.
They refuse to work with me to give me access to my account after I opened a support ticket November 15, 2017. I can't withdraw my money and now their official reason, which I have evidence of, is because I sent them a picture of a seagull. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:40:09
Why do people need to escalate tickets? Why isn't opening a ticket good enough for you? You need your customer to jump through two hoops in order to be taken seriously? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:58:48
It's not very relevant, but the 2014 registration with the CA Sec of State shows the company was founded in London. And we'll have to disagree about the forced arbitration equating to shadiness. Various members of Congress, many federal judges, many law schools, and all consumer advocates are against the practice. To say that it's "easier to take legal actions" against Kraken is akin to saying that it's "easier" for you to lift a 20,000lb weight than it is a 21,000lb weight. Nothing is easy about arbitration and various studies have shown it is biased in favor of business.

Total bullshit about working to completion. Total, utter bullshit. You folks are outright Trump style blustery liars. I have evidence. How about you let me take you to court and if I do not present it, you can countersue me for bringing a frivolous suit. Deal? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:41:05
No. I do not see how anything I said could equate to it being "easier" to take "legal action" against Bitstamp. I don't care for the term "easier." One of my points is that it is incredibly onerous to try to hold Kraken accountable for their abusive customer service practices, breach of fiduciary duty, and capricious requests in order to get anything resembling support.

Kraken has an address in San Francisco. They were founded in London and are registered as a corporation in Delaware. Why do you care about a office they rent in San Francisco? How is that going to impact anything? 
Kraken's Terms of Service prevent you from taking them to court in the event you have a dispute with them (say, for instance, they stop responding to you and you are unable to withdraw your money). Instead they have a forced arbitration clause. You can Google the term "forced arbitration" to see that everyone except shady businesses are against this practice because of how unfair and abusive it is toward consumers. So I'm not trying to be combative, but I really don't understand how having an office in SF is going to "have an impact" in anything.  
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:24:55
Kraken always insists that "stories out there" from Kraken's customers "are not a fair representation." Instead they would prefer that you listen to Kraken about the quality of Kraken. All hail, King Kraken!
