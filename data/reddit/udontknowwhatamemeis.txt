This article explains very nicely the philosophical argument behind conservative block size limits. I have understood this viewpoint through the course of this debate yet still lean towards "aggressively larger blocks is better" with about 95% of my opinion.
Where is the data backing the false analog between the castle in the story failing and networking issues failing to sustain larger blocks?
I'm sick of screeds sketched on the back of napkins in the form of blogposts and reddit shitposts outlining vague philosophical arguments.
Where is the data to support arguments about centralization risk? What is the evidence to support the idea that larger blocks will cause fewer miners to mine bitcoin?
My professional opinion that has slowly surfaced is that the more highly technical (CS-leaning) members of the development team do not have the training or intuition about game theory, international economics, and the behavior of the future financial world to make these decisions arbitrarily.

All of the companies and entities that have been investing dollars, time, effort, and research into growing the bitcoin ecosystem to the incredible thing it is today will have to completely refactor their entire services if LN becomes the only way to use the network cheaply.
That is a complete disaster and a betrayal of users. I would love to see a historical example of a worldwide software system successfully growing through this sort of transition.
"Bitcoin Core" has come to the consensus that the current version of bitcoin is not suitable to fulfill its value proposition. What a complete joke.

Much of the ire in the debate can be attributed to people not wanting to be wrong and not wanting to admit that ideas they've stated in the past have been shown to be wrong as more information surfaces. It is ok to be wrong. We're bootstrapping a global economy from nothing, there will be ideas along the way that do not work out or are ahead of their time.
The way to deal with being wrong is to learn from your mistakes and apply what you do know to come to better, more robust, anti-fragile solutions.
Failure to do so will leave people on the wrong side of history.

With the blocksize controversy it seems like bitcoiners are trying to prove that we are (devs, redditors, me, companies alike have all done dumb shit).
That said, the reason that bitcoin will be valuable is even dumb humans can't fuck it up. The politics of open systems are messy particularly because they are well-vetted. We will tame this bitch and then the fleeting dreams of the moon we get today will seem like distant tales of yore (they already are it is only a matter of process and determination and time).
@_date: 2015-12-23 06:20:03
Thanks so I guess the answer is "you still have to mine the actual invalid blocks" so you may as well just mine valid blocks and reap the block reward.
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:31:04
Piggybacking off of this: let's say at first 20% of nodes upgrade to new SW implementation.
Is there a mechanism for these nodes to tell non-SW nodes about invalid blocks with SW transactions inside?
I am imagining an attack where I randomly spam many blocks full of invalid SW transactions. Can't I create a lot of havoc with endless invalid blocks propagating around through non-SW nodes?
I am more asking because I don't know the answer to this... frankly I don't see how a network with mixed SW implementation will not create many new attack vectors. This is the reason in my mind that introducing complexity or wide refactoring of critical network infrastructure is almost never a good idea. The only time it would be is in the case of emergency or in the case of "nowhere else to turn".
In my mind we are not close to there. Our proximity to there is either fabricated or imagined and I'm not sure which is worse.

When a smart person disagrees with somebody they try to understand the evidence and reasoning behind the other side and either strengthen or revise their arguments based on what they've learned.
When somebody who lacks intelligence disagrees with somebody they block their ears and push the other side away.
Garzik and Andresen disagree with this roadmap, you can dismiss their expertise if you want. The glory of bitcoin is that it will route around entrenched bullshit if it becomes a threat to the protocol. I make no claims about winning or losing I only care for the health of the network. If transactions 10x in another big adoption phase I think all this fancy bullshit will be routed around. A capacity increase of 1.75x in 3-5 months (and this is only for those miners who upgrade) will degrade network performance if that happens. So I'm glad we have options for a clean fork at that time and I hope Core will be pragmatic rather than stubborn and sore and help move the protocol forward if it comes to that.
I don't really get why you act like such a dismissive ass. We all want the same things and it's smart to understand why others have a different idea of how to get there.

A true consensus was never allowed to develop as discussions of forks of the protocol (note my language here, rather than altcoin - you party line shill) were censored from this sub and nodes running that fork were DDOSd.
Rebranding XT as an altcoin was the most damaging part of the block size debate and it has hamstrung the bitcoin system's ability to route around people like you who would otherwise damage it with myopic thinking.

Because then you're just "ragdolling" the economics and operation of the entire system and userbase. It is difficult to develop code and even indeed to use bitcoin itself under these conditions.
Any transition should be smooth, well-tested, and planned. Imposing an arbitrary limit to "let a fee market development" and then taking it away by raising the blocksize is a completely untested and untried event... Developers have literally no idea how this will effect network usage or adoptions, other than various theorycrafting they do in their free time instead of improving the protocol or developing simulations or tests of this event.

Good question, I had to write the math out to make sure I wasn't talking nonsense...
Metcalfe's Law says the value of a network grows proportionally to the square of the size of a network (it was proposed to apply to telecommunications networks but is often quoted with bitcoin as well).
Thus if the size of the network grows 10 times, the size of the market cap should grow 10^2 times, or 100x. So the current market cap of bitcoin according to Metcalfe's law based off Jan 2013 network size and price should be $14.1B / 13.5M coins = $1044 / BTC. to the moon, QED :).

Actually according to metcalf's law the value grows with the square of the size of the network, so fair value should be around 100 times that of January 2013.
Funny thing is I think $1,000 is almost spot on for fair value of a bitcoin these days.

Well the censorship and doublespeak branding of "hostility" or "consensus breaking" forced on projects like XT that seek to promote a new consensus to move bitcoin forward was my original objection in this thread and I stand by it.
My opinion is that **using a block size limit to influence market dynamics is the consensus-breaking change** being pushed on bitcoin, as this was not the case when the cryptocurrency was formed, and was not intended by its creator and not supported by many of the best devs and many of bitcoin's users.
So censoring posts discussing a fork that seeks to lift this artificial constraint is fucking insane and intellectually weak from those who support the limit as it stands.

Maybe it is the core dev team that doesn't quite understand some important aspects of the bitcoin system. Based on their behavior I have come to that conclusion.

It appears to be a common motif among bitcoin devs: "if the solution is not a complex theoretical project I'm working on yet to be released or tested then it's not valuable". Unless you are shipping code weekly that touches users it seems like this thinking is the main way to achieve relevance. Not that these solutions won't one day help the ecosystem, but they are a far cry from abstractions we can build on Today to deliver value to users w/ the bitcoin protocol.
As somebody who codes on production, user-facing applications that use the blockchain: there is a very real need for simple, proven solutions like this that can be dropped into production to let companies spin up faster. I think the economic majority would agree with us. I'm psyched to see you pushing for this flavor of development. I wonder if Brian Armstrong can contribute here. Greater collaboration between the bitcoin big hitters and the development community is the way around much of the centralization and pressures blocking adoption today (IMHO).

Cool ad.
So I assume bitx is one company who will route around a blockchain with 1MB blocks and $10/transaction fees given a huge surge in demand for bitcoin transactions. I wonder how they'll do it? Could be a fork, could be off-chain transactions, could be another coin.
@_date: 2016-01-08 21:40:50
To be fair his common sense is rooted in a (possibly false, hotly debated) premise that the block size should be changed or set based on the activity within bitcoin's fee market.
There could be inputs to a fee market other than a centrally planned block size, and this argument simplifies that idea out of existence.
@_date: 2016-01-03 19:04:05
I guess I just dont understand your argument. Or where you draw the line between a fork that is good or bad. I believe the network will enforce a stable consensus as individuals act in their own interest. If I can break that by introducing a fork that "breaks consensus" then the network sucks ass.

The first section lists a variety of bitcoin nodes on testnet (roughly colored by region) that submitted results to track block propagation on testnet.
The scatter chart shows the total time required to propagate a block as a function of block size. You can see the various scaling rules that apply to each region by looking at the rough shape of each color family on the chart.
The third section shows a timeline from left to right of a block propagating through the network. The first band shows the time it takes to download the block for the first node that sees the block. The next band is the next node that sees and downloads the block and so on... By reading down the chart you can watch as the block propagates through the network and hits nodes in each region. Note the delay and duration of download times for each node in each region as a function of block size. These can be sorted by block size or by block number.
We should gather more data. You guys (devs, citizens, luminaries, VCs, etc) are all fucking idiots sometimes.

My point is I feel it's silly to engineer based on a possibly fabricated game theoretical argument when allowing the system to grow in an open natural way to serve increasing demand is the first logical priority.

I have significant experience developing software amongst unknowns and in my work I've found indecision due to future unknowns to be the enemy of progress. 8mb blocks will work well for the foreseeable future and I believe the planned increases make a lot of sense given technological progress.
If the protocol faces challenges down the road due to larger blocks then I would reevaluate and I think the protocol will do the same. However developing now (or not) based on lack of knowledge of problems I feel are 5+ years in the future is completely foolish in my opinion. I don't think we can develop effectively managing future issues we cannot hope to understand.
This fork goes a long way towards mitigating any short-mid term issues and as the technology and demand progresses and future bottlenecks reveal themselves then open source software development will solve those issues.
And to address the words you put in my mouth: I do care about centralization you ridiculous infant. I stated clearly that an immediate increase to 8mb poses no danger to the decentralization of the network in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-20 22:31:10

People are being ridiculous. Bitcoin is anti-fragile open-source software. May the best fork win. It is possible the core devs are correct that bitcoin needs more testing. However a cartel model determining the philosophical and technical future of bitcoin is silly and completely against the spirit of the project.
This kind of software idea is what will make bitcoin a world currency, if that ever happens.

@_date: 2015-08-15 21:48:35
Hey I hear you about not being hasty. But I feel this proposal hasn't been hasty Gavin came to the final 8mb number after putting the issue up to many important entities in the ecosystem.
Enforcing some arbitrary parameter introduced initially as a kludge just seems like bad practice. Imposing parameters on the system because of some weird game theory argument made by developers who think they understand economics and can accurately model the bitcoin system economically seems literally insane to me. Doing so is more dangerous to the long term health of the system than 8mb blocks will be in my professional opinion. If 8mb blocks break bitcoin then it probably wasn't a good idea to begin with.
Finally I understand that other scaling decisions may need to be made. But really keeping this arbitrary limit that is basically cruft from the infant stages of the blockchain is weird and stupid.
My final aside: your inability to have a mature technical conversation about this makes me reticent to trust you to program my money software. I'm glad bitcoin can route around anything that threatens it and I think you do too so I'm glad we agree :). Btw I never downvoted you that was the other haters.

An off-chain solution for supporting the millions of transactions while also pegging to and validating with the bitcoin blockchain for security and permanence.
This type of activity NASDAQ is discussing (as well as many things I assume 21, inc. is hoping to accomplish) is the market for LN, not cups of coffee. If so many people try to use bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee that it floods the blockchain we will all be millionaires.

Excellent essay.
I wish I could speak directly to Gavin and Mike and tell them I appreciate their work beyond any expression of words. They've acquitted themselves well in an ugly public arena of debate and they've come to a technically sound consensus taking the desires of the ENTIRE ecosystem into account. This is the vision of bitcoin.
I've been discouraged and disgusted by the behavior of many so called 'core developers' and 'experts'. I appreciate they may think they're doing what is best for the protocol but I feel their judgement has been clouded by the allure of 'winning' the debate.
I think it is a classic behavior of developers to push for an overly complicated solution to technical problems without regard for the ramifications of the complication -- Especially when personal profit (either monetary or intellectual) can result from the adoption of their solution.
The reason bitcoin has succeeded to this point is that it is a simple, open, cheap platform. I'm excited to get this fork behind us and excited to get back to the central mission of world domination through peer to peer means.

I want to scale the system for next year and the year after that. If the only argument for LN right now is it's necessary to scale to Visa transaction levels then that shows how ridiculous it is to implement and force on the system with artificial constraints this early into adoption.
I don't disagree that more sophisticated trustless layers will be necessary in the future to massively scale the network. However I really think it's irrelevant to the current discussion of scaling bitcoin through the next wave of adoption (btw I mean institutional uses in case you try to start talking about coffee again).

It's a nice idea in theory. I think you should try to think carefully about which parts of 'reddit' need to be decentralized and which parts would be premature/useless optimizations if decentralized.
The chicken and egg problem of content/users is nearly impossible to solve without a great product idea and even then it is a constant uphill battle to keep people engaged. Putting up barriers like each new user needing a bitcoin wallet etc is imo likely to make this impossible.
You should also refer to it as something other than 'decentralized reddit' since it's a separate project. 'Like reddit but decentralized' even works for me... the point being you're trying to create an incentivized way to post and share content. Modeling it directly off of reddit is only going to shove you into pointless directions when more direct/unreddity directions could result in a much better end product.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:51:33

The thing is I don't see the point of getting worked up. Thy posted a fork. The economic majority will decide whether or not to accept the fork. Anybody is free to post their own version of the software and allow miners to choose. It seems strange to be so afraid or restricting of this new version because you don't believe it to be 'right'. Stop dicking around at conferences and post your own fork so the miners can decide.

Honestly man,
All I ever hear from you is somewhat compelling theorycrafting about schemes that may or may not be possible to execute. Simply conceiving of something, wrapping it in a nicely explained medium post, and using the words 'decentralized' as much as possible do not a successful project make. Why didn't you code up a prototype during the time it took you to write this medium post?
And the way you unceremoniously and publicly aired any dirty laundry possible just days after leaving reddit was a bit gross. Right or not in that situation it makes me know I never want to work with you.
No offense.
edit: I decided to list some concrete problems I've come up with so far so I'm not being handwavy and vague...

So this brings us to a sort of prisoner's dilemma then. If all other miners dutifully filter all but the most legitimate of btc transactions, I could mine high-fee spam transactions without worry for the long term health of the blockchain (and make lots of money mining full blocks of high-fee transactions).
Is there a way for the network to defend itself against 'predatory miners' in this scenario?
Honestly I'd really like to hear experts weigh in on this question it feels to me like the crux of the issue...
@_date: 2015-08-05 05:28:49
You describe something but I fear you miss the symptom. A system like this would work well if high-quality content was always upvoted and low-quality content always downvoted.

When averaged over a wide swath of not-so-clever lazy internet leftists you get reddit groupthink.

Beautiful visualization.
I wish the dimming effect wasn't so severe when you zoom out. Not sure if you can tweak this easily but once there are many transactions when I zoom out to them all it becomes too dim to see.
Right at the level where they start to dim they twinkle like stars, though. Pretty far out :).

But bitcoin is a system built on incentives. The human brain is the same. I don't doubt good intentions but I doubt good sound thought based on developments (or lack there of, hurr hurr) over the past 12 months.
The fact is that bitcoin will be governed by competing economic incentives. The question is will the great h. badgerus remain a decentralized set of incentives in equilibrium or something perverse that converts all of its precious utility lifeblood into $$$.
It is slightly worrying to hear developers at Blockstream express concern for the sizes of fees paid to miners while building a system to route around miners with transaction processing (for a fee) off-blockchain.

@_date: 2015-07-07 01:52:52
Really? In my mind any attack on the blockchain, including spam attacks, needs to be prohibitively expensive or the bitcoin system is broken. You're saying I need to trust miners to arbitrate which transactions should and shouldn't be included in blocks in a timely manner? Don't miners act in their own interest and make money by including these transactions?
Do other devs agree with you? Honestly I think you are wrong.
Edit: mobile on an aircraft typos
Edit: and in my mind a 'fee market' should make spam attacks prohibitively expensive there's no sort of consensus algo to do so. How is a miner supposed to parse which valid transactions with sufficient fees are 'spam'? Does the reliability of bitcoin really depend on their ability to do so? Sounds shitty tbh and I love the blockchain more than anybody I know.
Otherwise you're saying 'bitcoin is intrinsically vulnerable to spam attacks unless miners correctly pick and choose which transactions to include on the blockchain.' ???

The problem in my mind with this approach is that feedback mechanisms can have unpredictable effects, the breadth of which are hard to test. Any feedback mechanism regulating blocksize has (in my mind) infinitely many more attack vectors than a fixed cap.
I do enjoy the elegance of such an approach I just think it is almost too unpredictable to be considered robust.
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:35:35
But we can't expect miners to ever act against their own self interest. That seems antithetical to the idea of bitcoin to me. Miners act in their own self interest. This secures the network. This was my understanding and I didn't realize there was an 'except in these cases where we need them to be nice to bitcoin to keep it running' caveat. My gut says there can't be a caveat like that or bitcoin is broken.

@_date: 2015-09-29 23:09:43
The more I think about it... it should be very predictable...
Miners will vote for a block size that maximizes their profits while mining bitcoin. This is a fee market price discovery process built into the consensus mechanism. If it makes sense for the network (will make miners more money) to have bigger blocks, then they will raise the block size limit. If it makes sense for the network (they will lose money due to bloat/spam or no 'fee pressure', if that can even be created) they will lower the block size limit to an equilibrium value. Thus the balance of off and on-chain transactions will be set by the economic equilibrium of supply and demand for block space (and the ability of the network to support the transactional throughput).
We are already trusting the miners' consensus to secure the system and make it work. Why don't we trust them to set the optimal block size?
Something I'm starting to believe more and more is that a group of developers can inform us about the risks and rewards of various block size limits, but they should not be trusted to set it absolutely. That goes against the central notions bitcoin was originally founded upon... the notions that make it valuable.
Something that seems weird is to keep parameters in the system that maintain a certain advantage for certain miners under certain networking conditions. We don't try to meddle with countries where electricity is cheap... Mining is a competitive market, if your bandwidth isn't good enough to support the consensus block size then you should find somewhere that it is.
TLDR; Devs should spend more time trying to massively scale the network and make block propagation more efficient. Let the miners decide what the block size is, it is their job to decide the rules of the protocol.

@_date: 2015-09-30 02:15:07
The argument you're making seems to be 'because there is a rule constraining miners' ability to make bigger blocks we need a rule constraining miners' ability to make bigger blocks'.
I kind of think going from increasing block space supply -&gt; increasing bitcoin supply is a bit of a false equivalency. The damage of all miners agreeing to increase bitcoin supply can not be overstated. However the claim I'm making here is the best vehicle to discover the optimal block size is a consensus by the entities in the system actually creating block space and being paid for that block space. I'm not sure I understand how what you wrote refutes that as an idea.
Regarding your last paragraph... There will still be a limit voted upon by miners. I leave the design of the mechanics of this system to the experts. However if some majority (specified by the protocol) of miners say they could make more money by increasing or decreasing the block size limit a certain amount, then I think that new block size is more economically efficient and thus better than the one before. You still need some given majority of hashing power to change the rules. If a malevolent entity has that much hash power to begin with they can already do nefarious things.
I appreciate you taking the time to work through this with me but I'm afraid I'm unconvinced :(.
I'm really liking the looks of something like BIP 105 (without that pesky 1Mb&lt;blocksize&lt;8Mb on the last line).
edit: I guess I'm asking... what does an actual attack on this system look like? And just another point that the supply increase argument really irks me. Limited supply is a fundamental part of bitcoin's value proposition. Limited transaction throughput/space scarcity is not. Decentralization is, but again I'm asking how does some economic equilibrium discovery process achieved only through a majority of hashing power destroy decentralization when it could arguably vastly increase the value of the network.

I don't really get why people here are so dense and knee-jerk to just latch onto the mining aspect like a seagull from Finding Nemo and pronounce it useless.

I hear you. Frankly I think the 'best' long term solution, once the system is robust and hardened, is to do away completely with the block size cap and let miners set their own caps. Maybe this needs some extra incentives built to keep blocks small but maybe not I wish we had some reputable simulations about this kind of idea (or maybe observations of some alt coin).
Something I doubt is that miners would collectively act against their interest to push more than an economic equilibrium of transactions off chain. If miners are pushing transactions off chain in my mind that means this is best for the bitcoin ecosystem. The fee market that should reveal itself is that all transactions that are important enough or worth the marginal cost of including in a bitcoin block will be carried out on chain, and those which are not will eventually be pushed to off-chain solutions. This is an economic equilibrium driven by the cost and utility. Unless it is some kind of sophisticated attach from an off-chain transaction provider who buys mining power to push more transactions their way...
For people who claim to hate restrictions and rules and champion open systems with self-sustaining laws, many of the devs and community sure are hellbent on setting as many parameters of the bitcoin system as possible and tuning them to their specific will.
@_date: 2015-09-30 06:49:31
The current situation is that bitcoin follows the code the most miners are running (the code that has mined the chain with most POW). I'm not exactly sure how the consensus model extends beyond that but many people seem eager to conflate it with their own motivations.
Please understand I'm not saying you're doing this or have ever done it. I'm just saying I see it as a large vulnerability. Potentially much larger than a miner vote price-discovery process for block space -- within constraints if you'd like to be cautious.

Hey I don't know where else to tell you this but I think your talk at the conference this weekend was excellent. It was very simple and I feel a lot of people looked over it as 'Econ 101' but it was really getting to the crux of what the block size debate is about, I appreciate your work putting the presentation together! I liked the dam image ;).
I had recently started likening bitcoin to 'jet fuel' for the banking industry that will be hedged and used in the same way airlines use jet fuel. Your talk made me feel smart lol.

How can you say that? Bitcoin is supposed to be anti-fragile and its enemies will only become more powerful. Devs should be eager to witness attacks on bitcoin. If the blockchain's only defense is our requests for attackers to leave it alone then it has no intrinsic value.
This is what we've all asked for... the real world and production environments are dangerous. If there are attack vectors then please defeat them! I appreciate your work there.

So then the potential damage a single core dev could do is unlimited (using your logic from a previous post). I don't understand how a council of self-appointed developers all of a sudden have full veto power on any change to bitcoin. Part of the value proposition of bitcoin is that it can adapt to grow and improve. How do we trust a small group of people with absolute power over that process? That is not trustless.

Many of the current barriers to bitcoin's success are due simply to the humans involved being unwilling to admit they were wrong. We need pragmatism from everybody in the community, not the same partisan, polarizing, overstated debate method we've all become obsessed with due to the American political process and mainstream media.
I am speaking to members on both sides of the block size debate here.

@_date: 2015-09-14 19:04:20
The immaturity of devs on reddit has probably been the single worst thing for bitcoin (in addition to censorship) over the past 6 months or so.
That and their inability to move towards a pragmatic, technically sound compromise given the heightening stakes for the ecosystem. 
Watching the conference calmed my fears a bit, to be honest... I realized you aren't all retarded internet children... really not many of the devs behave appropriately or professionally online and it's hurting the ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-09-30 06:57:18

To be fair your point of view seems to be consistently along the lines of: 'Don't tweak what was initially an arbitrary parameter to make the network more accessible to everybody in the mid-term, because [hand-wave] a monster with a sign that says centralization around its neck will eat us all' (tone yours)
@_date: 2015-09-07 22:04:01
I am witholding judgement until hearing about products released with some of their high-profile partnerships. The implications for what they're trying to do are pretty exciting though... beyond the 'mining for btcs yay!' reasons people here seem to assume is the entire point.
@_date: 2015-09-12 18:13:31
Sounds really interesting do you know what time in the stream it will play at? I want to watch later. Are the slides from these presentations going to be available somewhere?
@_date: 2015-09-01 17:45:35
To continue with your points: There needs to be unquenchable demand for space on the blockchain before a fee market can form and it is economically favorable to move transactions off chains to other settlement layers.
Trying to make this happen before there is unquenchable demand is some kind of cartel-model self-serving strategy and it could destroy much of the value of bitcoin in the mid-term if successful.
Frankly I've started to come around to the idea that miners are the group best suited to set the economic inflection points between on and off-chain transactions to maximize the value of the network (by voting on the blocksize, perhaps within fundamental limits dictated by the system though not sure about that part) whatchu think.
@_date: 2015-09-18 04:34:37
I feel like miners maximizing their fees while still making transacting on the network worth doing is literally the definition of the most economically pure solution.
The marginal cost of space on the blockchain should equal the marginal utility of that space.
ninja edit: @_date: 2015-09-05 23:25:53
I'm not sure why Proposal 2 is necessary. Can't we trust that miners will enforce some fee pressure once block reward becomes negligible? It's not like miners will just naively mine huge blocks of no fees they can create the market themselves by limiting the size of the blocks they mine.
I kind of think miners setting their own block size caps to enforce a fee market once it becomes necessary for them to make money is the perfect tradeoff and feedback mechanism to 'choose' the block size cap.
@_date: 2015-09-30 02:46:40
Something like BIP 105, with a slow-moving block size chosen by some 'stable majority'. Thinking about it more and after speaking with you I guess I do support that last line of 1Mb&lt;block size&lt;8Mb... maybe the developers still need some teeth as they watch how decentralization develops.
What about something like this... in this way you get to observe how decentralization develops alongside the 'block size discovery process', while still constraining the system to be resistant to 'economically efficient' NSAMegaNodes.
A worry in my mind is that the human mind has a very hard time grasping the concept of exponential growth. We may be strangling our baby in its infancy without even realizing it's only a single cell that will eventually become Life On Earth. I trust the miners (maybe slightly constrained by the devs) to fundamentally decide the rate at which that happens.
It would at least be an effective experiment to watch decentralization develop with the block size market.
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:47:50
By the way I predict a hype-cycle of big new product releases from bitcoin companies over the next couple of months. Now that it is in the news -- even if just for the blockchain-y aspects ;) -- the time is right to ride the wave.

There will likely not be an investment opportunity like bitcoin for a long time to come.
@_date: 2015-09-01 06:35:52
What if I told you the guy probably agrees with you that bitcoins will increase in value as the value of the blockchain ledger is realized?
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:27:59
Because private blockchains will increase the value of the bitcoin blockchain. Don't believe me? Just watch...
@_date: 2015-11-26 06:54:22

The barrier to entry to hosting a node in a datacenter is incredibly low and will only get lower. The number of data centers in the world capable of supporting a bitcoin node in my opinion is 'innumerably large'. Comparing needing a data center to run a node to being a central bank is such an exaggerated statement it is basically meaningless.

I am here to concur... the way the bitcoin community (both the 'citizens' and the 'core devs') has treated Mike and the idea of XT has been an absolute joke.
Anyone is allowed to code and promote a fork of open-source software that is how it remains strong.
The characterization of XT as hostile or some coup has done a lot of damage to the short-mid term future of bitcoin. Regardless of who is right in the "block size debate", that characterization is a complete joke and the perpetrators of that meme on the core dev team and on various bitcoin forums should be ashamed of what it has done to the community.
@_date: 2015-09-03 20:04:47
Ya I'm not trying to support a 'larger blocks -&gt; more decentralization' argument. Just saying it's an engineering tradeoff, not some binary good or evil. We gotta ride the wave of technological progress as demand scales. We gotta do it carefully but we gotta do it.

If more companies can use the bitcoin blockchain to enhance their business, more companies will run nodes to validate transactions.
Cheaper, more accessible throughput on the bitcoin blockchain will allow more companies to use it to enhance their business.

Why does the limit have to be 'artificially capped'? How do you know it won't be capped by miner bandwidth requirements? What qualifies you to decide some artificial parameter in the bitcoin protocol?

I don't think the government can just start using things they confiscate in criminal cases there are probably laws against that.

Great post thanks Peter. This is why I feel the characterization of XT as an alt coin or hostile coup, which has been echoed and propagated by core developers and prominent members of the community, is te most insidious and damaging thing to ever happen to bitcoin. And it's by some of our own - how sad that is...
