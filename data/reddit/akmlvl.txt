We coming babe
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:14:56
they have a backup pdf sheet that have the seeds but it got deleted from my computer the problem is you can only get it once after registering so now i have 0 control over my bitcoins 
so the mt gox case is a good fit for my situation and further on i will only keep my bitcoins on hardware wallets thanks deftin
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:05:36
what's an odd behavior ? they never sent me an email they never showed me a warning if i knew it was disabled i would never have used that address to receive my payment 
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:54:52
please read the post i lost that backup sheet and what's killing me that they are not replying to emails
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:33:12
as i said i feel like im the dumbest person on earth that was a big mistake
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:56:36
thanks bro i worked it out 
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:31:55
nope i'm security aware i change my passwords frequently and i use different ones across different websites and i have 2fa auth on on all services 
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:22:28
hope so 3 days now and counting
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:15:30
why don't they specify the suspicious behavior that their system detected so it dosen't look like a scam ? what if their system is stupid and detects false positives or flags  ? why don't they send an email or show warning  on the wallet ?  why don't they reply to emails immediately ?
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:44:45
hopefully even a 1 dollar transaction never gone though
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:00:10
i will use a hardware wallet for all my coins i learned my lesson
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:10:17
yes man this isn't a small amount i will for sure not quit thanks for the advice 
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:56:16
it's a weired pdf file that haves a lot of keys and encrypted words it can't be practically written on paper but that was a lesson only self controlled wallets further on
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:41:56
same even with 1 dollar
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:46:03
sent 5 emails not a single reply
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:48:12
If you can't handle replying to emails then don't lock someones funds that needs them in a specific time you know that you caused me 5 business days loses you know that right don't you  ? you just don't care it's obvious
don't try to implent security features that are not working properly and are beyond your power to handle
show users a warning on the wallet so they know their wallet is disabled so they don't use it to receive a payment
and show them the reason
i don't think anyone will use this wallet anymore
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:53:21
first of all i though i had that backup sheet but it got lost
secondly how can be there someone else logging into my wallet ? i've ben logging in for the last month with th same ip and never did anything suspicious this seems like a stupid reason to justify their lock
and so if it's all true they suspect someone is logging in my account why don't they reply to my emails they said contact support and we will reply """""""" immediately""""""""""""""""""" 3 days now and no reply 
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:02:03
you think so ? can be possible that seems so bad what a mistake have i done
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:39:12
this is a golden rule man you don't trust websites you never know whats behind in the code lines
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:40:15
oh nice if so can you not lock users funds
thank you
