So much FUD. I guess all the Bitcoin ATMs are in vein because FUDsters hoping to short said so?

You can always select projects more in line with your own values
I can see projects trying to bring block chain to third world countries as being sort of more in line with leftist principles. Sort of. EOS, TRX and BCH would be more like the Trump projects lol

Thanks, I'm not in the know of the other options so that is good to know

No one can predict the future so if it dips and you think it's a good entry point, go for it. I've just been making some final moves these last few days then I'm just going to ignore for awhile. Unfortunately now every day is a bigger bloodbath than the last

I will have to find someone I guess. I moved out of my hometown but maybe I'll find someone.

Yeah great idea, I wanna live in a world full of well armed, sick and uneducated people too. HYREAHRHH

The laptop for some reason is completely mysterious how to get to BIOS. Nothing takes me to it, none of the F keys, escape, or delete

Lol,the concept of cryptocurrency IS "globalist" to a degree
Try traveling sometime, currency conversion fees are a bitch

Thanks for the replies, problem is now solved. I simply just installed an older version of Ubuntu and it booted right up. I love accomplishing things

Thanks for the detailed input! Problem now solved
"Try another ubuntu image if it keeps failing."
I just downloaded an older version of ubuntu and it worked this time. I read into the raspberry pie thing and it seems cool but complicated at first. I'm going to read up on it more.
"As someone else mentioned further down the page, you can do this from any machine offline, but you need to hope that there isnt any malware already on your machine which may somehow grab the private key you just generated. I think that is really really really really unlikely but people like to be sure. "
Exactly. And also, I might be wrong but couldn't information from printjobs also somehow be seen by a third party? I agree of there being a low risk just doing it offline anyway, but why not take the extra step just to be 100%

This is what I was thinking
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:50:35
I think the point is to be extra sure of security. Maybe it's a bit paranoid but is for sure the safest

People should be more empathetic. Unfortunately many have their own agenda or are just jerks
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:25:27
There's a lot of selfish and immature people around. Rational posts get down voted. Newbies get down voted for asking questions. Everything that someone isn't holding is a shit coin. Etc

It doesn't matter whether or not BCH is superior to BTC. The deception going on with the way it is promoted is unethical and bad for crypto as a whole. Would the words "scam," "fraud," or "misleading" inspire confidence in new investors or adopters in this technology? I'm pretty new to this, so in would say as a newbie in the game, it definitely brings me feelings of uncertainty.
Edit: grammar
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:12:31
Can someone please explain what this means. Btc about to be sold on an exchange? Massive dump incoming,?
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:02:58
Thought I had a legit question, whether it may be stupid or not, so thanks for the downvote trolls
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:53:56
It's a forum for the BCH troll army/cult. Quite deceiving. They claim also many things about superiority, such as BCH having lower transaction fees and it being "satoshi's original vision," and also talk a big game about adoptability. Problem is, the whole marketing plan is deceiving (Roger Ver, bitcoin.com, etc). I even saw a post on there with someone gloating "if we can convince 10% of people that something is true, the majority will start to believe it," which is a tactic of fascists. Steer clear of the trolls

MCbishy, good points, but some people can't purchase online for specific reasons, usually if they have banking issues. The ATMs would be convenient, though the fees are a bit outrageous. Still, that's totally shitty about getting robbed, the administrators should know how much money flies around with BTC and would be great if they were as well informed as the robbers apparently are

Why is it, that since visa/mastercard supposedly banned crypto purchase with credit cards, so many exchanges still show it as an option to pay with credit card?
I've tried several exchanges and my credit card always gets declined, with one reason notification even saying "Do not honor." My visa debit works just fine.
These exchanges are teasing me with even having the option for CC purchases.
