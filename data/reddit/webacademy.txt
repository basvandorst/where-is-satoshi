Just like any other money!
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:56:17
I see. Seems like maybe Im paying high fees but I didn't manipulate anything, I just processed transactions through Blockchain, Localbitcoins and Cryptopia exchange and everything went through in less than 30min (for 7 transactions in the last 3 days).
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:07:54
You mean that's what the majority of the world has already done since 2013.
I think It's getting much better now.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:52:40
I guess you are just stupid but you think being smart judging people while you can't even think clearly. I don't care about you. :)

I'll HODL until price hits 11,596,328,945,001
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:15:11
If they didn't get in 3 years ago its only because they did not have the courage and were waiting to see what early adopters were going to face before joining them.
Again, Im not talking about everyone, but the majority.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:43:38
Around 300
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:58:08
The price doesn't drop $1000 in 24 hours every day. So, yes, many scared people are selling today and that what I was referring to.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:53:30
I know. It sounds stupid but that's the truth. I didn't took that kind of security measures. Also in my whole life, I've never encountered a hard drive crash on any of my computing devices.
Anyway, I am much more careful now. In a paranoid way lol
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:28:00
I am not being naive. I could hear you and understand your way of thinking, even if I disagree with it, but just don't treat me as an idiot because I don't share your way of thinking.
Personally, I think and believe that, at this point, we are Satoshi, simply because we took over his work and now we have power more than of the Real Satoshi. We are not even sure if that famous wallet is going to get active some day but even if he does what you think, we will just overcome it as any other obstacles we've faced in the past.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:02:09
I don't care about McAfee, but I still think the interview was good to watch, even if he didn't say anything interesting about Bitcoin but it was still funny.
And stop asking people to stop when you can't even stop yourself from commenting on what you can't stop.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:36:32
Of course. It is not contradictory to what I said.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:09:54
I think we should just stop the stopping thing right at the end stop.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:02:40
Development team are dummies. I'll wait for Bitcoin Poo, or BitPoo. Sounds like a crazy shit.
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:54:04
I don't know how you can speculate on my behavior like that :)
No, I have my own way of dealing with "important" things. That's all, so you can't say it wasn't important simply because I ignored it "on purpose". And that was my mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:52:38
At what rate he bought his Bitcoins? That's what he lost.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:35:43
Standard fees

Very unfair to Bcash Spez, I would suggest Fucking IDIOT
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:38:25
Its easy to say. When the laptop got stolen, the bitcoin price was around 20USD. Since there, I completely ignored the Bitcoin, until last year when I checked the price and it was already above 1500USD. Now its 7500. So I can only afford fractions of Bitcoin :)
But yes, thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:23:38
No, if we agree on the bike price then even if the Bitcoin collapses, you should honor your agreement.
But anyway, we can't agree on this point but that won't prevent us from leading a happy life, so i have no interest in arguing too much about it :)
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:41:47
My bad
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:17:24
OK, I give up :) No need to convince you.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:16:52
Who said don't spend? Just don't exchange them all for Dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:49:12
If I get 1 BTC for $0.10 today, then the BTC value increases on next day to $1000. I don't really have the 1k USD until I exchange my Bitcoin for 1k.
So if the 1BTC got stolen from me in the meanwhile (before exchange), then I would have lost $0.10.
If I do exchange the 1BTC to 1k USD and then reinvest the 1k to buy a Bitcoin (which cost 1k now), then if the Bitcoin got stolen I can then say that I lost 1k USD.
That's all.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:05:25
There is no way for BCH to dethrone Bitcoin. It's just impossible. If somehow, in some dream, they end up dethroning Bitcoin, they would die the same way. Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency, without it there is no future for other cryptocurrencies, no matter how you look at it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:01:19
No need to kidnap BCH. A lost of time and money.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:11:28
The transaction fees are not related to the Bitcoin value if Im not wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:59:08
LOL, people are surprised but that's how it is. Bitcoin won over the Stock Market.
The fact is, most of the voters don't have the 10k and so they believe that if they had that amount of money, they could just buy Bitcoin and get rich. Hilarious but  I like it.
Anyway, I do believe in Bitcoin but not because of the poll or what other people thinks. I take full responsibilities for my decisions.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:48:39
I know some people who are "talking" about it since 2013 and are still talking today. Most of them are still waiting and hoping for a crash to say "I knew it, I am smart". But each and every day is a pain for them.
Also those who buy the Bitcoin now are just doing so for a fast profit, they don't care about the ideology and most of them are not seeing any future for it, its just like a gamble for them.
Anyway, I hope for a better world with Bitcoin.

I didn't sold for 2 years and I wasn't thinking about it, but who knows...

By next June? Nooo. That should happen on October.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:35:19
I understand what you mean, but that's only because we are still thinking the old way with fiat currencies in mind. I am just hoping for a new model with more stability. I am hoping for a world with Bitcoin as the main currency on which all other currencies are basing their values on, not the opposite.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:11:49
The round earth was a delusion and so many other things. So I have no problem with that "mental disorder".
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:28:23
I know Bitcoin since 2010. The trust we have built around crytocurrencies is all due to Bitcoin's glory over history. If you kill Bitcoin, you kill the TRUST we have on cryptocurrencies, and if you can, in any way, kill Bitcoin, then you can, in the same way, kill any other cryptocurrency. Simply because Bitcoin is the Cryptocurrency, the one with a big C.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:10:44
Not fair. The Bitcoin would never get back to the floor. That looks more like BCH lol
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:07:53
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:20:32
My 12 words are encrypted. Each and every letter on every word has been turned into a mathematically calculated number, then each number has been turned into letters of another cryptographic language. And the key to decrypt everything is only on my brain. I can hold the encrypted cryptographic words in front of everyone, there is no logic behind the encryption, except my logic.
Hoping that Alzheimer won't get on my way!
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:53:23
I think because its much easier to get a Bitcoin.
I mean, everyone knows about Bitcoin today but only informed people knows about other Altcoins. So maybe he wanted to make things easier for the victim. That's the least he can do. lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:39:52
Im not that stupid. Of course Im talking about GETTING THE MONEY, not just seeing it.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:57:08
No problem, I can understand your way of thinking but Im just not thinking the same way.
That won't prevent me from leading a happy life :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:29:49
You didn't understand what I meant (maybe you didn't even read my comments) so please don't say "as you keep saying". I have never used the sentence "Bitcoin didn't change value". 
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:28:04
Yes i think it is. Its just like a domain name that no one else can get except if you transfer it yourself to the new owner. So no one can get the same domain name.
Except that domain names are not yours when you acquire them, so you need to keep paying to keep it. That's the difference.
Also mining doesn't work the same way, lol. On domain names you can just create new directories, subdirectories, subdomains which also are unique and can't be duplicated.
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:50:45
I wasn't even thinking about those details back then. The private keys were on the Bitcoin core software, nothing else.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:30:57
I agree. But what I was hoping for is a new model.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:07:08
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:45:04
No i didn't, sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:44:16
I don't think so. He's too stubborn to do that.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:40:31
There won't be any dip right now, get ready for $9000 before the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:21:50
Because their hopes were built around fiat currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:57:02
I love it when people notice that other people show appreciation for people who show their gratitude, because it make us prepare ourselves for a warm up of the original feelings of gratitude.

Blockchain, LocalBitcoins and Cryptopia Exchange
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:08:05
Now its the opposite. When they buy at 7k they sell at 6k
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:00:24
The governement control us, but who control them? With Bitcoin we are just going to be equal.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:01:03
OK, I give up because I understand myself but , Or you know what, i'll try a last time...
Let's say your bike value is 1BTC (Because we all agreed that the bike price was 1BTC), then you should sell the bike for that price, and that's all, that's the agreement. Now your 1BTC will have the value of the bike or any other equal value for other products. Then if someday, we agreed on a new agreement which states that the bike price is now 1.2BTC, then that would be the case whether or not the Dollar exist or not. Its complicated to explain but I understand myself and that's why i didn't want to argue about it lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:06:59
Actual left ball? Was there another left ball? or can he replace that?
I don't understand. Why the "actual"?
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:49:04
Seems like you understand just what you want. Good for you and good luck.
I am who I am, Be yourself. If you have something different to say, just say it. Instead of replying to my comment to say some shit.
I capitalized the "i" because we are at the start of a sentence. The mantra is in your thoughts alone.
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:46:09
I am not worrying, I am just being nostalgic in a bad way...
I hope some day I'll be able to "sincerely" laugh about it :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:03:06
Nothing is safe! Especialy when you have bad feelings about it. So take the right security measures and be careful, with or without segwit2x
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:25:48
Of course I would say the same thing. That's a stupid way to think about what I said.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:36:14
lol, I didn't notice that. Good one :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:40:11
That was my mistake, yes. I got frustrated and ignored the bitcoin since then.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:00:43
I like people going around treating people as idiots while they can't even think wisely.
Let me say something to you, idiot. WE ARE Satoshi Nakamoto. So fuck you!

No, but at least just from you.
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:13:10
This is what could happen after the 10k. Castration of testicles.
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:56:03
Yes, I am so beautiful :) I feel it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:12:24
At that point, yes, I will forget the dollar.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:28:25
0.00000001 x 1000% = 0.0000001 BTC = 0.00 USD.
There is still room from improvement.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:16:10
But that's because we are valuating the Bitcoin with Dollars.
Also, the Dollar market price goes up and down few cents, but you don't go changing the price accordingly. That's what should happen with Bitcoin.
But Yeah, I known it's still far away.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:58:49
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:57:00
That is not a consolation :) Except if you are looking to make feel worse.
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:48:13
No need to feel sorry :) Thank you for the kind words.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:45:05
I don't care, and Im not evading tax. The point is, the government is taking information from third parties without our consent. 
Also, people don't need paypal to evade tax. Those who evades tax are doing so with the help of the governement so they are just targeting the weakest with this move.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:32:44
Just intuition. There is no point in explaining why. People don't want to know and won't understand, even if I came up with the proof. Damn downvoters!
Buy or Sell at your own risk! then Cry or Laugh for your own decisions.

No, he lost what he spent to buy them. Sue me.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:55:56
You are right! I was too excited to share such an info so deliberately :)
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:55:17
What are you talking about? Please stop talking no sense and check before accusing a legit business of scamming. Where is the scam? Maybe you are not interested but please watch your comments :) or show us the proof of the scam.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:32:40
I agree. That's one way to look at it. But your equation doesn't include the possibility of a fluctuation (good or bad). Isn't there any chance of a big surprise?
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:38:29
Thank you for the compliment. (Some people use it as an insult) so sorry :)
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:02:39
Thank you for your participation to improve the reddit experience. I still think this is a related topic to Bitcoin so i will just wait for the community judgement. Thank you again.
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:53:40
Yes. I would not have found a better way to express myself :)
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:47:34
We are not competing to see whether or not we can find words with the same value :) There are a lot that i can share with you. I only keep those who are special in their relation to each others. It is about Bitcoin here so that would be great if you get something related to Bitcoin word since you want to play the game.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:04:29
Let me give you 2 other words that have the same value as BITCOIN and are definitely defining the nature of BITCOIN:
S+A+V+I+N+G = 72
L+I+M+I+T+E+D = 72
And the Bitcoin is definitely Limited and good for Saving
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:47:34
Is it funny? What is so funny about it? Please develop your opinion, i am interested :)
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:29:37
I see. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:02:42
I can do much better work :)
BITCOIN = 72
MONEY = 72
And ... WORLD = 72
Which means BITCOIN is the MONEY of the WORLD.
What do you think about that?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:23:43
"About one-third of respondents said, 'you'll pay the price' for investing in bitcoin."
Of course you will pay the price. You can't get Bitcoin for free now, its too late, so you have to pay the price to get it. Or just set back otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:14:51
Great hobby. I have much better ones, i will keep them for later. Keep watching :)
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:23:01
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:35:08
Not really! But i have no problem with that insult :)
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:41:18
That is a judgement :) But believe me, i have a lot of fun with this hobby. Anyway, its just an ascertainment. Don't worry about me :)
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:45:08
No, there is no contradiction. The bitcoin cannot be compared with the traditional currencies. Also i am not talking about value's stability, but rather the usage stability, if you understand what i mean...
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:22:06
Seems like you are a moderator of this subbreddit, so there is no reason to keep arguing since my post will be deleted anyway, right? lol. That's why i did it myself to make things easier for both of us :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:06:48
I built a script to calculate the values, i just need to type in words. Your idea is among my next related project :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:01:07
I have tried all of them with no success. The only additional ones that i have found are still representing the Bitcoin. :)
F+I+R+S+T =  72
L+U+C+K+Y = 72
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:16:14
Obviously! The definition of MONEY is well known everywhere in the world. Unlike for other languages, You can use that English word anywhere.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:31:42
If he still has them?  Hell Yes!
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:28:13
Is the bitcoin going to change the world?

How can the gun get the job done?
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:12:47
What do you think guys? Is the Bitcoin price going to rise up sooner?
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:20:00
I said its one of my...etc, i do have much "better" ones. But anyway, what is better for you is maybe not better for me. What if i wasn't able to move, would you be suggesting the same "better" hobbies? What if i was just born stupid and can't think of any other hobbies. Would that be a crime? I don't understand why you turn out the subject just to criticize a stupid detail :(
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:34:41
I have found a way to run off all the words in the English dictionary :) There are around a hundred but I have found only 2 that are bad: Failure and Despair.

Interesting! On what are you basing your speculations?
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:57:01
If he keeps them he is going to get so far above the 1st, and would be unreachable at some point.
What about the Bitcoin Gold? He is going to get a Bitcoin Gold for every Bitcoin he possess...
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:23:00
The f is wrong with you?
Go comment on another post.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:01:15
Yes, I understand. Its confusing for you because that chart serves exactly what the creator needs, not what you need. Also that chart wasn't meant to be shared in the first place, so as long as the creator can understand what it says then who cares about others.
Then why I shared this chart? Simply because the volume heartbeat on that chart is very special and unique in some way, because it can really predict price move in advance. So let's see if it will do it again.
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:06:25
Yes, you are a genius.
But let me correct your mistakes...
First, the used indicators are custom indicators and not random ones.
Second, the thing you are calling "cool" is a sudden huge buy volume increase. and Last, it's bullish because the signs shows that.
Now, if you think you are so smart to take that into consideration, then just stay where you are.
And FINALLY, that is not my chart nor my doing.
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:17:07

The thing YOU should know is, garbage comments like yours are being sent in billions.
