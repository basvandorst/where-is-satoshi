Double down.  Dollar cost average!

I think the crypto exchanges themselves (Bitfinex, etc) could establish a huge short position and then manipulate the price of Bitcoin down and make gazillions of dollars easily.  That’s what I would do if I was the owner of the largest unregulated crypto exchange.

Bitfinex blows up and Bitcoin goes to $2,500

Did the price of tulip bulbs recover the ATH?  It has been almost 400 years.

Imagine a medieval scribe copying a 120gb+ data (as of 2017) by hand every time there is a bitcoin transaction made.  LMFAO

I haven't seen anyone actually 'use' their Bitcoins as a currency.  Everyone here are just speculating on rise of the price, hoarding their Bitcoins instead of actually using them.

That wasn't a joke.  You might be right that only dozens of people actually use it as a currency.

"I don't think so, I tried to buy something with Bitcoin yesterday on a popular retail site and the transaction timed out twice. I have a hard time believing anyone is using it for anything other than trading and speculation right now."

LMFAO!  Bitcoin is worthless without electricity.  Imagine Mad Max buying shit with Bitcoin in the post apocalyptic world.

Genius!  Pyramid within a pyramid, Inception style.  LMFAO

Cash out your initial investment ($400) and leave the rest ($1,800) in bitcoin.
If bitcoin crashes and burns, you do not lose any money.  If it goes to the moon, you will make a nice profit.

'Dozens' out of millions of transactions

So how many people actually use Bitcoin the way it was intended to be used (as a medium of exchange), instead of using it as a speculative vehicle?

Wouldn't the blockchain be several yottabytes in size in 200 years?  Pencil and paper?  You gotta be kidding me.
