My bad, I read that as "compared it to digital gold". Regardless, the comparison doesn't serve you. The mining comparison is in relation to work done, and he says nothing about a long term store of value. 
So either way, my original point stands: deflation incentivises saving and not usage.

Well, he didn’t. He compared it to gold mining: “The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation.” 
Nevertheless, I’m not suggesting that Satoshi didn’t know what he is doing, I am suggesting that deflation doesn’t incentivize spending but rather saving. So if the cap was specifically for value increase, it’s opposed to the function of a medium of exchange.

Which is weird considering the original goal was digital money. Deflation doesn’t incentivize usage, it incentivizes saving.

So I think there are a variety of points to be made in response.
Firstly, if the supply remains capped, the price will *arguably* increase indefinitely provided two assumptions are true: 
1) the human population continues to increase; and
2) Bitcoin remains useful.
If Bitcoin becomes the de facto currency, an unlikely outcome for the foreseeable future, a growing population will ensure that demand is continuously growing, but there won't be other currencies to compare to and therefore no price. At this point Bitcoin would be a good medium of exchange, but only because inflation will be built in; more humans with which to split the finite Bitcoin supply. 
If it doesn't, then inflation of fiat would add to the demand and further increase the price of Bitcoin, again eroding its value as a medium of exchange.

Rather look at things on a spectrum. Binary arguments are limiting for many reasons.

I mean, that's debatable. In any event, I think that you meant illegal drugs in your original post right? My point remains.
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:56:32
Yeah and Tether did more for Bitcoin than either! /s

You do you bro. I was merely stating that things are not black and white, regardless of how you choose to view them. There are legal drugs that can destroy your children's future, there are illegal drugs that can enhance it. And vice versa. Saying "well if they don't destroy their future, they must enhance it" is not helpful if you're trying to come to any sort of reasonable conclusion. But, I will support your right to say it anyways.

People used their bank accounts to eft money to drug dealers before Bitcoin. It's definitely not a reach. And humans have always gravitated to drugs in some way - our society has just created a negative narrative around them.

Again, binary thinking is not helpful. I think that some drugs may enhance my children's future. I think that some may destroy it. I think some will have a neutral effect. Why so absolute?

Was it the drug that destroyed his life, or the addiction? 
This is exactly why absolute or binary arguments fall down against reason. Steve Jobs, as a famous example, took magic mushrooms and LSD. His life was palpably enhanced - I think he even attributed some of his creative thinking to these substances.  But another person might take the exact same amount at the same frequency and think he is an orange for the rest of his life.
This same example can work if you replace it with Ritalin.
Things are more complex and complicated than “this is this and that is that”.
