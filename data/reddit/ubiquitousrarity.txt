Loose rhymes with goose.  It is the opposite of tight.

1991 Lexus with 214,000 miles here.  Toyotas, man.

Please, please give us this chart!

Good point.  Bitcoin may rise in value, it may not- but 100% sure cars lost value until they are worth almost nothing.  That's a good path to take.

Beautiful design.  Where do I get one?
@_date: 2017-04-27 16:07:10
Still no reply; no help.  Nine days and counting and all I wanted to do was add a bank account so I can withdraw.
@_date: 2017-04-29 04:14:35
No progress at all.  Got one short e-mail and nothing has happened yet.  Hmmm....eleven days and still can not even add a bank account.
@_date: 2017-04-27 03:24:21
I've emailed you.  I feel frustrated that the only way to get help is by making this public.
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:53:13
It's May 3rd- fifteen days since I first asked for help.  Still absolutely no help at all.
@_date: 2017-05-01 15:21:11
Yeah, Rae, whatever.  I got the same kind of response from "Rosie at Coinbase" on another thread.  Thirteen days and counting and I still can't add a freaking bank account.  You people are utterly worthless.
@_date: 2017-05-01 15:01:08
Still absolutely nothing has happened.  I'm getting no responses after the initial email.  Why, Rosie?  Today is May 1st- thirteen days since I requested help.
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:21:42
Where did you go after you left Coinbase?  I'm really getting sick of being ignored.
@_date: 2017-05-01 15:18:09
None of this surprises me.  I have $60,000 in Coinbase as of today (I know, I know, I know...) and I have been trying to add a bank account to withdraw some for thirteen days.  "Rosie" from Coinbase replied to one of my threads here but nothing has happened.  Like, literally nothing other than a single e-mail from them.  Coinbase is a joke.

@_date: 2017-05-01 16:00:16
I certainly will.  It's a shame that the only way to get any kind of help is to post on a public forum, but it is what it is...
@_date: 2016-07-15 04:05:57
I browsed a little- pulled up 10 or 15 listings- not a single price on any of them.  What am I doing wrong?  Why do I see "NaN BTC" on so many listings?
@_date: 2016-07-30 16:06:53
Without a doubt.

Yeah, the contraction is "would've".  It's not short for "would of", but rather "would have".  This gets on my last fucking nerve.  But that's about me, not OP.  I'm a pedantic bitch.
@_date: 2016-07-31 14:01:26
I would argue that they aren't at all interchangeable.  One is right, and one is clearly wrong and stupid.  "I would of helped you if..." or "I would have helped you if..."  The first is wrong- not only grammatically but according to accepted norms in usage.  The only reason people know what you mean is they think you are saying "would've".  When you write it, you clearly look stupid because you have no idea what the word "of" means, or how it is used.

Blaming your clients for problems is always a great idea.
