coinjar is good, i've had a great experience

i know that. i never suggested it did. i was just happy to introduce a banker to bitcoin

I wanted to try the service but cant register, when i click registration link there are 4 field boxes with no description as to what info i need to place in those 4 boxes 
edit: i think it was a very temporary issue/or an issue on my end or maybe even a glinch all works fine now and i have bought the majority of my bitcoin from this company, definitely best in the Australian market, occasionally you don't get the bitcoin instantly (you get put in a queue) but it never takes more than 24hours

bought 4 beers at the only physical store in Sydney that accepts bit coins - then the price jumped man they were some expensive beers
@_date: 2013-10-18 07:37:43

i agree thats a much better way to put it

i wouldn't, what his doing isn't so terrible.. using a little but of electricity and helping the bitcoin network and maybe making a tint profit for themself - let it be a benefit of being a school it teacher. Unless the room is like a sauna - then report him cause that excessive - otherwise no harm done (not worth them maybe losing job over) porbably some old redundant out of date computers anyay- oh and what some else said don't be a snitch - if you really feel you must do something it would be much kinda and appreciated by them if you approach him directly and just ask him/her straight up you noticed and were just wondering

i'm very conscious of this i've heard alot of people say things like i'm not selling until $1000/btc, that could be a huge mistake, i'm thinking if it hits $1000 its probably going to hit $2000 and then probably $3000 
but you have to take profit at some point and picking that point could be tricky, i'm all for holding for the longest time but cant hold till you die

cant claim cause of no way to prove you don't have the private key.

i checked my messages and had this from u (below) and for a moment my great excitement faded a little as i thought its only temporary thing at the pub when barry is there but then i realised it was an old msg from u great to see you having success, you r a bitcoin warrior is ur motivation just the good of bitcoin??, i've wished i had time to do that i am very much excited to be attending. and over the moon about the fact a pub in sydney in accepting bitcoin, hopefully it can catch on.. ive thought for a while Newtown would be a great incubation area.. 
comment replyAussie restaurant that accepts BTC in Sydney?
from ryszard99 via sent 22 days ago
As far as I know BTC is only accepted when Barry is there, ie on the meetup nights.
I'm working on places to accept bitcoin permanently..

i love satoshi forest - the house looks like a child's playhouse from a rich kids back yard.. can't wait to see a bunch of them.. wish there was somewhere we could more updates on whats happening with the forest or maybe much hasn't happened, not criticizing cause its so awesome but wish more could be done.. should have things on the site like how many BTC would one have to donate to get another house added for another homeless person
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:21:32
agree completelyand i do concvert cash to bitcoin (rather than spending cold storage) when i can make a purchase with BCT- what you have said is what i wanted to add on but was lazy at the time - but particlatly the point i wanted to drive home is that even though spending BTC supports the bitcoin enconmy selling or spending coins too early(using peoples cold storage) will be and has been the mistake of many
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:51:29
do it behind your parents back, they will be impressed later
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:32:03
but importantly this is after we dropped from 266
@_date: 2013-10-01 07:50:24
i think it could have an effect. this could cause some people to doubt how safe their money is in USD and look to alternatives like gold and bitcoin, the effect won't be immediate though. i think most people thought it was all political games but like usual a deal would be struck at the last minute but this doesn't seem to be the case. cant believe the all mighty america has to SHUT DOWN. 
people could also be a little more likely to hold onto their coins rather then to sell back to US now.

had beers there paid 0.05033 BTC each for schooners of coopers green so slightly expensive which you slightly expect in the cross anyway but totally worth it and totally awesome to pay with bitcoins it was quick and convenient even more so than cash/card

i introduced the 20 something year old teller  at commonwealth bank to bit coin after her regularly dealing with my deposits, she was quite interested and said she will read up on it

i actually did search for '$27' in reddit sub thread and actually only found 1 post for someone selling something for $27, so haven't posted much to reddit and of course i don't like duplicates either.
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:31:30
this is a fact: bitcoin has spent very few days above the current price - so unless trading on the ups and downs - most people who have sold are should have held - this will likely be the situation again so DON'T SELL
the majority of bitcoin holders have have more purchasing power than when they bought and this was the DESIGN of bitcoin, it was DESIGNED to be deflationary that is designed to constantly hit new all time highes and at this point its working as per its design
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:06:27
i suggest sell for cash and buy bitcoins with the cash
and offer a discount if the purchaser pay with bitcoins
@_date: 2013-10-10 07:26:01
this can only be considered positive for bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:18:48
i want to know how many of these are out there
says in their site 
they have them places in airports around the world but their location map seems broken
@_date: 2013-08-25 06:48:42
i was looking for anywhere that accepts bitcoins in sydney
the place the meetup was at :
Brooklyn's Pizza Pasta Bar
29 South St Granville NSW, Sydney
now i'm wondering if they always accept bitcoin, or just for the meetups?
on their website it says
Payment is collected through credit cards (Visa and MasterCard), PayPal and other internet based payment gateways. 
no sure if that means bitcoin?
If we finally have a physical store accepting bitcoins, people who have bitcoins need to know
@_date: 2013-10-28 12:23:43
people would feel like you are just asking for money, i know i would, plan to hold your coins and get rich from your wedding? just ask for cash and buy bitcoins - buying bitcoins can be a hassle
@_date: 2013-09-16 12:23:52
i stand corrected - post deleted
@_date: 2013-10-28 07:49:11
Not sure if this has been posted already but this was on news.com.au today which is probably the most popular news site read around my office - had 3 people speak to me about bitcoin today because of it, told them all the benefits and that yeah my bitcoins have doubled in value in last few months and that they should look into it- one who i told to open a wallet at blockchain.info, they did this is about 2 minutes and then i scanned their QR from my mobile and i sent them 0.02 BTC ($3.90 AUD)  and it appeared instantly - the response was 'cool' planning to email them tomorrow ask them to check the account (looks like it would have gone over $4.0 by then hopefully) then i'm going to call and send another 0.03 while on the phone with them.
I'm sure this is a crazy story which demonstrates how crazy bitcoin is and will get a few extra Aussies into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:07:54
it takes longer - i just read this and cant act on this news until tomorrow
@_date: 2013-09-16 08:08:08
OMG OMG OMG I have been waiting for this moment for so long.... 
I'm locked in and will be attending!
i agree with the OP that this is a **historic** moment
for anyone thinking of coming it's a few minutes walk from kings cross station!
cant wait to make my first in person BTC purchase!
edit: !! 
edit: btw does anyone else know ANY other physical store accepting BTC in NSW?
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:15:28
if usd drops value of btc goes up - you will get more usd for your btc cause usd is shitter upon crashing so people would demand more of it for their bitcoins
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:19:01
serious this could happen?
@_date: 2013-10-05 07:36:27
as much as everyone says only invest what you can afford to lose - taking the risk of over investing could work out well, if your prepared to take the risk and the risk wont completely destroy u i say do it. gotta be risk-adverse to get ahead
@_date: 2013-10-28 08:33:16
Ryan you are a legend. I've bought most of my bitcoins from coinjar after bitinnovate closed down (wish i knew about coinjar sooner with the much lower fees) now i can now pay my bills bitcoin, my internet, gas and electricity. 
It is already very convenient to pay my bills using the bpay option in my internet banking however this seems just as convenient and means i can feel more comfortable converting more of my weekly earning into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:54:12
is it ok to connect or considered safe enough for just a few minutes connect to the internet and just to open the wallet on fresh installed computer to check the balance and than straight away disconnect from internet?
and only use the pc for that purpose
@_date: 2013-10-21 08:59:20
when your gloating just think about the remote possibility of how stupid you would feel if bitcoin crashed and you lost most of your investment, that keeps me lvl headed
@_date: 2013-10-18 07:01:35
translated important part: 
Reporter yesterday called China Banking Regulatory Commission, said the staff, "no recent introduction of regulatory policies for bitcoin plans."
