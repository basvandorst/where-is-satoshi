what are you, @_date: 2017-12-21 16:29:46
depends, i guess.
i compare it to fish, where there are tons of fish but the prices of them fluctuate with seasonal availability. if suddenly everyone wants salmon or tuna, and are selling their cod to demean the value of cod, does that mean that salmon and tuna go up in price? possibly, but maybe not right away. also there are a shit ton of different currencies (fish) in the market that are reacting to each other.
