Sure I did. What would I like to see a subjective opinion of (un)satisfied user. Like "try X — they are totally user-friendly and fast" and "don't use Y — they fraud me".

Try Multibit — that's a recommended wallet for an end user. It's lightweight, fast and syncs in less than a minute.

Where did you get this?
Multibit is an opensource software which is around for a long time and has never been exposed to vulnerabilities.
If you your OS is clean (you don't run suspicious software, keep your system up-to-date) and your password is strong then Multibit is no less secure than Bitcoin-QT
