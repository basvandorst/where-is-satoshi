Thank you for posting this. Love all the different perspectives! 0.06% of the world's energy usage is a tiny price to pay for securing the hardest form of value storage and transfer.

Could Bitcoin kill altcoins? We can only hope. Well, at least those of us who don't like infinite inflation through the development of a potentially infinite number of altcoins.

From my limited understanding, your Bitcoin is tied to the blocks in which it was mined. So, if the blocks that will originally create your coins have not yet been mined, then the blockchain in 2010 won't recognize your Bitcoin as valid, and so it'll be rejected by the network.
So here's what you do:
1: Build a time machine
2: Sell all your Bitcoin for paper fiat
2a: Make sure all of your paper fiat was printed before 2010
3: Time travel to 2010
4: Use all that fiat to buy as much Bitcoin as possible
5: Time travel to December 2017
6: Repeat steps 2-5 as desired

Are you asking for a friend? ��
Seriously, though, I'd just smile and go back to sleep. I'd probably sleep better than I ever have in my life, knowing that my family would be pretty much set, financially.
Then I'd probably use some of it to donate to charity and start a business. I dunno. Send me 17 BTC and we'll find out! ��

This is a good question, and a great example of why a blockchain is only useful for something like Bitcoin. In short, there's absolutely nothing preventing a jeweller from putting whatever information they want, whether true or false, on a ~~shared database~~ blockchain, since there's no cryptographic Proof of Work that can verify the quality of a physical object.
For example, I could hash the phrase, *"Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!"* and put that hash into a blockchain, and the nodes would see it and put it in a block, but there would be no way for them to verify if that is indeed true. On the other hand, if my computer solves a difficult math problem that takes about 10 minutes to compute, then it can send out the solution to all the nodes, and it would take them a tiny fraction of a second to verify that that is indeed the correct answer.
So, the moral of the story is that "blockchain" is just hype, and only a very small part of what makes Bitcoin work. A much more important innovation is Proof of Work, which is only really useful for verifying the energy spent to solve mathematical equations, so tokens can awarded in exchange for that energy.

You might as well ask how much money we've made from dollars or euros. Bitcoin *is* money, so your question makes no sense.
This reminds me of my all-time favorite Bitcoin meme, one with Neo and Morpheus talking:
**Neo:** "What are you trying to tell me? That I can sell my Bitcoin for millions some day?"
**Morpheus:** "No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to."
So, how much money have I made from Bitcoin? My answer: All of it.

I'm no expert by any means, but here's what I imagine would happen if governments started buying up a lot of crypto:
- Several governments (though most likely only one or two) buy almost all crypto and store it like gold
- Price of crypto skyrockets worldwide
- News spreads quickly that hodlers are getting rich overnight
- People all over the world buy more crypto out of FOMO
- After a few small dips from some people waiting for such a pump so they could sell, the FOMO and governments buying sends crypto to the Moon
- With so many new crypto users, more merchants adopt it as a payment option, and quickly discover its advantages, such as being deflationary, decentralized, and automatically fraud-resistant (thereby making it cheaper for them to use since they don't have to pay huge fees to credit card companies and banks)
- In an effort to scare people and take back control, the governments that bought tons of crypto sell most/all of it, tanking the price
- But the cat's out of the bag, and the now-knowledgeable people BTFD, tanking the value of fiat, and ending any chance for governments to retake control
- Little by little, fiat becomes a distant memory, an old nightmare, as people turn to harder money to store their value and exchange for goods and services, just as people have always done throughout history.
The moral of the story is: Governments' and fiat's days were numbered as soon as Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper. No matter what governments do, the global takeover of crypto, sooner or later, is inevitable.

That, and Bitcoin's permanent and absolute limited supply (gold doesn't even have that), its decreasing flow of new coins into the market, unconfiscatability, anti-fragility, borderlessness, and the near constant debasement of fiat currencies. Hypothetically, if the leaders of banks and nations did everything *perfectly* with their economies, I believe Bitcoin would still grow moderately, as users would want a hedge against the slight possibility of something going wrong with fiat. But as long as leaders of banks and nations continue doing everything they've already been doing, Bitcoin has nowhere to go (in the long term ��) but way, way up.
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:58:25
I am not an expert by any means, but judging by the pace of growth on that chart, and taking into consideration the new innovations on Bitcoin, the big players who are rumored to be buying Bitcoin OTC right now, and the trajectory of the Fed's interest rates,... my very uneducated guess would be 2020 or 2021.

Bitcoin is borderless, so the country I currently reside in is irrelevant.
Bitcoin is sound money that no one can stop. History tells us that people naturally gravitate toward sound money, since it incentivizes them to save against an unknown future. Bitcoin is scarce, so its value will always tend to go up over the long-term, as people add more value to it by both trading fiat for it, and trading their time, energy, and skills for it. All these qualities will slowly teach Bitcoin users to lower their time preference, thereby gradually changing our culture from one of "must have positively worthless things now at the expense of potentially valuable things in the future", to "freely choosing to forgo less valuable things now in exchange for much more valuable, important, and long-lasting things later". Of course, this change won't be all sunshine and daisies; there will be a lot of pain along the way. But, this cultural shift will eventually (think in terms of generations, not years) affect every part of society, creating a more advanced, creative, and hopeful world for everyone.
Does that answer your question?
@_date: 2019-09-08 05:06:41
We believe in the importance of scarce, sound money. Bitcoin is kept scarce by the code, but no code can keep people from endlessly creating more coins, thereby lowering the value of all of them. And since we deeply dislike anything that devalues our money in the long term (wouldn't you?), many of us deeply dislike altcoins.

The thing about technology is that it balances itself out. They create quantum computers? We create quantum-based security measures (for lack of a better term). They create telepathic technology? We create telepathy-blocking technology. Such things are in an eternal arms race, and not worth worrying about. Just stay on top of recent developments, and you'll be fine.
