But I was only talking about right now, in the US, cashing out usd to a US Bank.

K, I hope no one ever takes this advice (including you).  Just so you know, what you are proposing is called structuring, and it's a felony.

Yeah that's a taxable event man.  You need to report each of those sales or purchases.

This is where you get downvoted by all the kids in the space who think you truly can get away with cashing out tens of thousands into a US Bank account without the IRS noticing.  Good luck to you guys!

Entirely different from what I was saying.  I specifically said cashing BTC to USD, and even more specifically into a US account..

Ouch, brutal truth
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:22:38
Sorry  referring to US law.. Not sure about Europe 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:25:03
Appreciate it
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:21:13
No you wouldn't 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:18:44

This is a new low in content quality on this sub, lol

Yeah but you are instead placing the burden on the customer.   Instead of paying 3%, tell your customers up front that they will cover the credit card fee and see if they are OK with that.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:51:52
Yeah, he's wrong
