Yes, that happens when people sign up to Reddit. Crazy eh?
Anyway, i don't really understand your comment. What are trying to say?
That i can't mention that people said it's pizza day for week now (they obviously got their dates mixed up) because i signed up a hour ago?
Hm no, that would be completely ridiculous. So what are you trying to tell me. I truly can't figure it out. 
Edit: right, just downvote me for being on Reddit for a hour. That obviously is what the voting system is for and we all know Bitcoiners wouldn't never abuse it.

No no, it really wouldn't! Try it please. 
Let me make sure you understand the question. How does that video explain that fiat is worthless?
And the OP for some reason didn't answer my previous question. I wonder why. So maybe you will. What are you doing with all that worthless fiat? Do you toss it in the bin? Throw it in the river? Let me know!

Stop worrying about this nonsense. It will never happen. 
In 6 months from now nobody will remember this company.

Suggestions for what?
Go do something else.

I assume you just bought as many coins as you could? With every last penny you could find? 
@_date: 2015-05-22 15:29:01
I normally don't click links without explanation but i was really curious in this case. 
I saw the clip. What does this have to do with my post?? Does that somehow explain why fiat is worthless? I must be missing something then.

You just have to ignore the part where those Fold gift cards are bought with stolen cards. Which they're really good at here.

Actually working hard and setting up your own company gives you a way better chance at a good retirement than trading/owning Bitcoin. 
But obviously people here don't want to hear that. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:47:16
Huh? I never said that?
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:09:58
It isn't a ponzi but think of it this way: what average Joe sees is Bitcoiners telling them to buy. Then they think why should i buy coins and then realize it's because it makes that first person's coins worth more. For an outsider this looks an awful lot like a ponzi. The fact that tons of Bitcoiners actually act this way doesn't help the case.

It's been Bitcoin pizza day for a week now. Amazing. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 13:46:37
Why is last week's news again on top of the mainpage?
And downvoted. Of course. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 13:35:17
Can you explain to me how exactly fiat is worthless? And what do you do with all that worthless fiat? Do you throw it away? Burn it? Give it away?
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:05:10
You've come to the right place. You're showing quite some cultist signs already. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:03:34
Now it's just a matter of time before you get rich, right?
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:12:05
It's horrible advice. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:53:54
Use your brain. Bitcoin lost 70% or so of its value in the last year. Why would they possibly suddenly start buying Bitcoin. Don't be ridiculous. 
Edit: feel free to downvote me but man up and at least tell me where i'm wrong. Otherwise i'm just gonna assume you can't handle facts and you're butt hurt. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:29:23
What exactly goes on in your head if you think anybody here knows. Seriously, what makes you think we can look into the future?
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:11:54
Hm where have i heard that before? Oh wait, at 1200, 1100, 1000, 900...
But now it's really low right?? Amazing time to buy!
Question to all the downvoters. What part is making you downvote? What part is incorrect?
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:32:28
Also may i remind you that most people who followed this sub's advise to buy in the last 15 months lost money. 
Never ask other people what to do with your money. Especially people who are already invested and want other people to buy as well.
