I'm just assuming this is copypasta and not going to bother reading it.

I'm not sure why I'd want to lose this. Have you never had an Amazon package not arrive?  
  


  
Yeah, we need corporations to foot that bill. (Which, I know, eventually ends up in my pocket.)  
  


  
Sensationalist bullshit.  
  


  
I suppose Bitcoin is completely free from fraud? This is laughable from a conceptual point of view. How does deregulation protect consumers from sellers?  
  


  
No it fucking can't - in-person transactions are subject to the same level of fraudulent uncertainties.  
  
Well, I made it through the first paragraph and gained no valuable insight. I'm not going to read 9 pages of bullshit. Got anything useful?

I think fiat currency has value because the world agrees it has value. And the world agrees it has value because "fuck you [our country's military] says is has value." Bitcoin doesn't have a country or a military. It isn't an asset somehow free from the confines of reality. So if it has a value, that value is based in reality. And that value can be tied back to an asset. And that value is reliant upon something tangible. So to make the currency argument is to say that currency has no value, or to say that currency has the same volatile value as Bitcoin. Neither seems to be true, so what is true?

Link the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:29:42
Just gonna mute you for being intentionally semantically obtuse.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:58:51
I'd say the difference is that products are products. And currency is what you trade for a product. And Bitcoin is neither, since it pretends to be a currency which has no intrinsic value and pretends to be a product which has no intrinsic value. What makes it worth a real thing?

I'm on board. It's an asset you can trade for currency. Cool.  


  
No issue.  


  
I think it has the value of the currency you traded into it. I don't think it can appreciate in value because it is not tied in any way to an appreciable asset.  


  
It is not intellectual property. I don't think you know what that phrase means. My brother might be stupid enough to be misled by this argument, but I am not.  


  
No, this is not something I care about at all. It's all imaginary, so my 10 unicorns are worth your 40 dwarfs, but it doesn't mean anything until some part of it is attached to reality. 
  


  
This was my only question.  I just wanted to avoid 
  


  
sensationalist bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:11:20
Well that was easy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:56:51
Well at least we found some sensationalist bullshit. I was worried you wouldn't show up and I'd look foolish.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:10:54
Sensationalist. Got anything worth reading?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:05:37
No, that is absolutely not my question. My question is why does it have *any* value, not why does it have [some absurd] value.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:53:28
Instead, I can be fleeced by a fence?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:09:58
Are you pretending these aren't quotes from your link? ...Did you forget to read what you linked? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:27:45
I really like this. Thank you.  
  
Something I don't understand is that I thought the point (or one of the values of) Bitcoin was its un-traceability. You have kind of turned that concept on its head by saying it can be tracked by the concept of a "public ledger." I would love to hear more about that.  
  
You have also used the concept of instant asset transfer. Is that truly the case with Bitcoin? I have seen other commenters mention that it takes time to make a transaction. Are transactions truly instant?

I am a CPA... I have watched first-hand the unraveling of my client's foreign bank accounts as the Swiss banks have folded to FATCA. I am sure Obama's statements (I'm assuming, sic) were in criticism of this movement, and there's no doubt it my mind that both sides of the U.S. political isle would love to capture any capital (or otherwise) income derived from Bitcoin. So to claim that this somehow supports the value only undermines it - if the value is somehow supposed to be U.S. tax evasion, it can only be short-lived and will amount to massive backlogged penalties.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:07:41
I should clarify that one can be both a dick and a CPA. It's almost a requirement.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:37:05
Can't argue with that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:36:29
I can't just put an asset on the books because I decide my work is worth putting an asset on the books. You don't get to create something out of nothing, and you don't get to create an asset out of work just because you feel like it. I don't tout my certification as some sort of badge, I just put it out there as "hey, I get the basic concepts of finance (and most of the complex ones), so hit me with more than your feelings."
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:34:15
I like the concept of Bitcoin as "gold 2.0," an intrinsically worthless concept that isn't useful in any physical application but we all agree has value due to its rarity. I'm not certain how or if its rarity is guaranteed or why it would be valuable to me (or anyone) to trade in this currency, but that isn't up to me to decide. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:52:48
So a nothing was created out of nothing, that has value because people want it? If demand is a billion and supply is infinite because there's no value, it's still zero. I need more than your "I didn't graduate Intro to Econ 101" explanation.  
  
Maybe I should clarify that I'm a CPA? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:31:52
If your argument is that fiat currency has no value, I cannot convince you otherwise. It is literally backed by military might and international treaty, nothing else.  
  
If your argument is that this is somehow equivalent to currency which is not backed by any entity, governmental or otherwise, I don't know what you are talking about.
