All valid points, but don't expect supporters of Core who are real attackers of Bitcoin and its working principles, to admit and say all the wrong doings they have done. Also their army of shills will just talk trash.... don't expect anything better from them. This part of the forums is utter garbage.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:04:13
Sure, sure
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:42:20
So Core are the kings of the Bitcoin kingdom now? Who put them in charge? Oh I know, kings put themselves in charge, and then its their way or the highway.... so much for decentralization (which means no one gets to make decisions for others, which most people here don't even follow or respect, Core being the sole leaders of this pack)
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:13:34
Sure we do, we know it better than you.
I know that real hidden agenda with Core and Blockstream who are funded by banks, is to trick users/holders of Bitcoin into leave using decentralised Bitcoin layer which banks can't regulate, as miners are acting as record keepers, and to go into centralised off-chain payment system, which will use hubs, which are centralised points in the network but more importantly, will act as money transferring entities, just like banks system works, which banks can and will regulate.
That is the real reason for Core preventing on-chain scaling, and none of the pretend technical reasoning.

That's probably what your mum thought when she was there at the time you were conceived.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:02:25
Yes I can do better, but I'll leave it now... you're not worth it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:17:05
Its because you had nothing else in your stupid head to put in your comment.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:55:03
I'm a senior network engineer, I have degree in Applied Physics, i know 3 languages (English, German, Serbo/Croatian) and I am in 40's, so if you think calling me a 12 year old kid is valid and not a stupid assumption, and actually name calling, it just shows you are full of shit. Typical troll and a loser who has zero arguments... and for the 3rd time, go fuck yourself.

Users are USERS. User only give Bitcoin value but do not run it or protect it, and same goes for any developer.
Bitcoin is a SYSTEM and only those that run and support and protect the system are able to have control over it, and those people are MINERS, by having control of their own actions. No developer can or should take that away from them... if and when they do, those developers become dictators in dictatorship.
This is what Core are now... nothing but fucking dictators.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:32:26
Can I? I want 2MB blocks... change the code to allow it... who will do this? Me? You are a stupid idiot.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:08:31
Gee, does it matter what type of room they work in? Its an open source code, anyone can add their intention to change the code, but code is not used just from anyone, someone still makes decision (lead developer presumably, why he's called that title) what goes into the code and what not.
But this is totally irrelevant with what I am saying, which is that the code that someone makes, and someone picks as next code change, cannot and should not be forced onto others. If miners agree to that code, no drama, but what if not? Is developer to force their decision onto miners, which directly affects every other part of the network, users, nodes as well as merchants.
Who are these developers that their word has to be forced onto others? Fucking mental for such thing to be happening in DECENTRALISED system... and then also the changes that these developers made, actually changed the Bitcoin protocol into something different from Bitcoin... and Core still want to maintain some ethical right?
YOU PEOPLE ARE MENTAL
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:22:53
yeah, I can see how your lack of any answers to the OP and lack of any actual argument shows you people are nothing but bunch of clueless and/or ignorant idiots.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:23:36
You are the ones that confuse everything. All of you are attacking miners, who are the very people who are following rules and run and protect the network so that everyone else can use it.
Decentralisation is when no entity has power over decision making for others. Democracy is when decision making of the collective is takes as what majority want, which is not the same as decentralisation.
You have double standards, first when SegWit is activated Core state BTC is what majority hashing power does, then when 2x part comes (as part of the same agreement for an UPGRADE) then rule is changed and Core claim whoever mines blocks different form existing one is the attacker and the chain that doesn't change is the BTC.
Core supporters have to be complete idiots not to see double standards and bullshit they put out.
@_date: 2017-10-08 00:47:03
News flash for you... while it is absolutely true that users buying coin is what gives it its value, the user has no direct say in what miners or developer or other users should do. Miner's decision stays only with miners (each miner for him/herself) same goes for developers, businesses and every user.
Only decision making power user has is to vote with their buying/selling actions, and not this shit forceful tactics that UASF was and what Core have been doing all this time.
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:44:48
You don't tell anyone what they should do, you saying users decide can only hold true if they buy or sell coin they want, which in turn creates demand for a coin and moves the price, that part is right, but users don't decide for the miners anything, miners decide this for themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:00:56
It will not make you incompatible if all or majority of the network does the same, and this is what will happen with SegWit2x fork, Core know it, and why they are talking FUD and propaganda against it, as they know it will screw up their intentions of holding onto Bitcoin name, keeping control over the Bitcoin code while at the same time changing its workings to become unusable and sell to user this idea that using centralised system of Lighting Network is the way forward, but if users do this they no longer use Bitcoin network, and instead use network that banks and government can and will regulate... and there goes all the principles of Bitcoin and what its meant to do, which is to take away the power of control from the banks and government, and Core are dragging everyone back into such system.
Yet so many clueless people still haven't figured this out, even when people like me point out the obvious to them.

There goes another typical loser's "argument" calling someone a kid... you people just don't know how to use facts. See good arguments come from facts, not from shit you, and those like you, write. You should go back to your herd now.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:31:47
See if someone said I had low IQ, beat my comment with good arguments, I would raise my game and reply back with counter arguments, what you did is pathetic trolling, name calling, pretty much idiocy. If anyone needs a bottle here its fuckheads like you that can't stand smarter and honest people calling you out on your bullshit. Now, go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:30:46
When Core want to have the last word on everything, you can bet that in decentralised system there will be many people that will want to, and will fork away from Core's attempt to control them. Core is not the boss of anyone... they will learn soon.. then they can pack their bags and get the F out.
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:37:46
Lulz shows your IQ
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:35:23
I guess this is why your stupid ego can't let you stop replying? I told you to go fuck yourself... now go and do it.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:02:06
People can and have been brainwashed. Core have been attacking miners using lies and propaganda, while at the same time undermining the very essence of what Bitcoin is meant to be and do.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:05:11
Typical change of rules tactics as you see fit. When USAF was pushed Core and you people were claiming that majority of users have a last say, when SegWit2x agreement was made Core is fine with keeping the 1st part of the agreement but not the 2nd. This is typical double standards tactics used by Core and shifting of goal posts as Core see fit to fit their agenda.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:28:53
Miners control their own actions and as they mine Bitcoin they control it also. Developers do not control the system as they do not run it or protect it.
* No miners = No Bitcoin
* No developers = No issues
You just don't get it.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:18:22
Well they (I think) are intending to follow the agreed timeline. Otherwise, I don't know if they are planing something else in secret. We'll have to wait out and see.
