So, I have used Electrum and Samourai to make Segwit payments, and their fee predictions still treat your transaction as a non-Segwit (at least so I think).
The way I do transactions now - look up the status of the btc mempool, find a fee level that would allow a regular transaction to get included in the next block and then manually set my fee to around 65%-70% of that. Been confirmed within 15 mins every time.

Wouldn't it be more useful to just switch to exchanges that already support Segwit? I'm using Bitstamp, but I'm sure there must be others out there as well.

They made it clear from the very beginning that the users will not hold their private keys. As far as I understand, it's the same as with other apps that allow you to spend your 'bitcoin' via card payments.

The dates are publication dates for the references found at the end of the whitepaper.

All of the words found in the image are also found in the whitepaper, so nothing odd there. 
This means there must be something else which 'marks' special words making up the seed, as well as specifying their order, since I don't think we're supposed to bruteforce the seed order.
Currently the only thing in the image that might mark words AND specify their order seems to be the white borders.
That's my opinion at least.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:03:37
Is it possible to create a wallet with a custom seed?
Otherwise I'm thinking the chance of getting a seed word list where all of the words are found in the whitepaper is quite low.

This is false - Bitstamp also accepts international transfers and card payments.

Yeah, definitely planning on buying it from their website (and with btc).

Many groceries? I don't know what the situation is like where you live, but all I have access to are only Tesco's, Sainsbury's, etc, all of which are giant nationwide companies (in the UK at least). I have sent them emails enquiring about possible btc adoption, but, as you can imagine, that's not gonna happen anytime soon. If you have any suggestions on how to speed this up, you're more than welcome to share. 
Anyway, my point is - isn't it better to keep a small amount of my money as btc on Revolut for daily shopping (even if I do not control the keys) instead of having to hold on to fiat?
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:27:57
A question: if I send btc from a segwit wallet to a non-segwit one, do I still have to pay fees as if I wasn't using segwit? And what about if it's the other way around?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:59:01
Hmm, well, thanks for your answer. One step closer to coming up with a solution, I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:37:39
I second this.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:20:40
Ok, in that case I will probably get one soon. Thanks for all the info.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:30:19
Well, I have an individual account, but no support yet..
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:08:56
Ooooh, well now my initial question seems really stupid. For some reason the way this works just hadn't clicked with me. Anyway, thanks for clearing that up.

I have slowly been accumulating bitcoin over the last couple of months, and I think it's time for me to get a hardware wallet. I was pretty set on Trezor, but then I found out that in comparison to Ledger Nano you don't actually enter your seed on the device. Do you think this makes Ledger considerably safer? Because I would still like to go for a Trezor wallet, but obviously I want my coins to be as safe as possible. Any advice?
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:01:38
I am looking forward to this because currently I cannot do my daily shopping in btc, so this will be a nice alternative until adoption becomes more widespread - keep most of my money as btc, but transfer some of it weekly to Revolut so that I can buy my groceries while still 'having it as bitcoin', even if I do not control the keys. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:27:58
So does anyone know when Revolut will finally support BTC? A month ago I saw a blog post and some stuff on Twitter saying it will become available by the end of November, anyone have any additional info?
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:38:10
Does it work with Electrum though? I think I saw some posts about people having problems after the latest update came out.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:50:19
Thanks for letting me know. Looking forward to it.
