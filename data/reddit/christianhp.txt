How's the wallet bitgo?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:28
But what's the alternative. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:47:36
never use coinbase. GDAX is much better. its owned by coinbase actually but doesn't have the ridiculous transaction fees.

Isn't this an Inevitability? Every time a first adopter sells their share, a large amount of capital shifts to the big-time investor

No, i already had 1500 invested. I then withdrew money from my savings acc to add to the portfolio by accident, not knowing I didn't have the funds. So basically the bank then reversed the withdraw sending the money back to my bank acc.

Sell and buy again imo. Or hodl and buy mor

its not the first time america meddled in any other democracy or government.

Thanks for the suggestion. I did exactly what you said. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:05:34
it takes a week to get the money. feelsbadman
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:21:00
Any suggestions on a good wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:06:09
You need to call them to fix this. Call them wgeb their customer service center opens at 6am Pacific time. They will escalate your case to the certain department and after that It should only take a few days for them to correct your account. Ask me how I know 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:45:00
yeah but the transaction fees are ridiculous. so theres no point
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:11:27
Yeah. That's horrible. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:39:25
Don't sell. Hold. It will take a few weeks to get the money back. And continue to hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:09:19
not anymore. its pretty obvious bch is a pump and dump rn. bitcoin will be back up soon
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:12:56
this could pan out to be true if theirs a huge crash and all the hodlers sell out. then all the big time investors could get their hands on a significant amount and then they will have it all. never sell always HODL
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:01:58
They're worse with money. Everyone i know spends every dime they get. starbucks, fast food, restaurants, new clothes etc. no one knows how to save and its a problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:13:41
tactics like pump and dump make it a scam. founders and people with lots of money in the know are throwing everything they have at it and will only sell it in the future right before bcash is worth nothing. insider trading was also rampant with the release of bcash on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:49:01
i just spent 40 dollars transferring .0001 bitcoin as a test. fucking feelsbadman
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:09:05
i will offer you one. gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:02:52
i wish this was more publicized. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:39:46
you need to call gdax when they just open up their call lines at 6am pacific. that's the only way you can reach them
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:49:52
look up mt gox. look up nicehash
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:17:42
I'm sorry to hear that. My account was suspended and I had no access to anything, similar to your situation, but they were able to resolve it within a few days. Try calling again, that's the only advice I could give you. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:09:16
call them
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:14:08
The idea is pretty much right
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:35:27
intuition and adoption rate im guessing. also market permeability i believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:45:38
Probably not
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:20:50
It's because my bank account didn't have enough funds so the transaction was basically reversed and was never completed. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:35:01
use gdax. transfer your coins you already bought there and then sell them there. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:54:23
Gdax isn't on mobile and coinbase is. I'm not sure why there's such a huge transaction fee on coinbase though
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:31:26
sell asap lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:51:09
i feel you. for me, it always seems like i buy in and sell at the wrong times. so its just better to hodl
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:27:27
howcome? someone that is self taught has just as much potential as someone that was taught at a university, if not more. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:19:39
invest the money into gdax. you will get your investment back quicker.
