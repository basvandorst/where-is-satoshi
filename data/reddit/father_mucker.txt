It can also be a Yuuuge cock-up if they start to struggle with the amount of users. Still this is great news and shows a lot of interest towards crypto and should bring a lot of new money to the market.

Lagarde is in favor of XRP, should be obvious if you paid any attention to her.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:52:09
Sounds like great news especially for those eho have been waiting to get validated in other exchanges.

Ok so this could explain the drop.

Who else is adopting Bitcoin other than Frank’s Old’e Autoparts in Montrose, Colorado, back in early 2018? No one. That boom also went. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:33:53
Bitcoin is speculative. Period. It already has centralized mining and big amounts are owned by few people. Do you think bitcoin would work as a great store of value or global currency?
If you are worries about your assets, why wouldn’t you diversify to gold, real estate, land/forest and stocks? 
I think what you are asking for is regulation to narrow the risk of manipulation?
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:51:33
Paamp it

@_date: 2018-09-28 10:22:35
It is not about the volume. It is about other investors reacting to the news. That is also how FUD works. People over reacting or big players trying to induce fear by massive sells. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 21:34:41
Can relate to that.

Pissed for lower price, eh?
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:33:12
You are right. In my opinion it would be best if manipulated coins like this went to 0. Small people should consider investing in coins with real life utility; coins which value is mostly determined by their daily usage. Not by pure speculation. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:25:54
No-one gives a fuck anymore. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 17:36:29

@_date: 2018-08-25 19:04:14
BTC has value because it is the first crypto ever released. It is energy-wasting, slow and mining is centralized. If BTC was launched today, it would have no value, since there is far better technology behind other cryptos. I’m sure that if a decentralized crypto will take over the world, it will not be BTC. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 10:13:50
We know for a fact, that Bitcoin may go up, down or sideways. Place your bets. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:39:15
No, only up.

How much did you lose?
@_date: 2018-08-30 06:08:37
Oh yes, now the list is complete. We just have to wait for:
- CNY to end
- Wall Street bonuses
- Consensus 2020
- Institutional investments
- Reddit traffic
@_date: 2018-08-11 08:36:59
It will be worth half of that. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 07:26:44
So were Apple and Amazon stocks. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 05:01:14
Also there would no other mobile phone without Nokia. Also there are no serious Nokia phones today. I pay credit to the first innovator, but time has passed and the first is rarely the best in the long run.
My point being that BTC is based on technology really not suitable for world-domination. It is just too heavy system.

Just look at r/coinbase , yes we do.

left her laptop on the counter
I could pee on that
Her new boyfriend just pushed
my head away
I could pee on him
She’s ignoring me ignoring her
I could pee everywhere
She’s making up for it
by putting me on her lap

Ok let me get this straight. He sold 30k units at a fixed price if $300? Why would this sell crash the market, as it only blocks the price going higher until eaten?
If he’d like to crash the market, he would set a sell order to clear the buy-side without a fixed price?
Am I missing something? This doesn’t look bad at all, since the buying volume is there. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 13:50:31
No, he is a meme enthusiast in general.

I think there are a few of problems here. 
1. Gambling and lottery are well regulated in many countries. You can’t have your own without a permission. 
2. Gambling with a speculative asset might not be the adoption you are looking for. 
3. Did you copy the name from RobinHood, which is trading site for stocks and crypto?
Sorry man, not trying to be negative here, but I’m not sure what is the point of this.

For every seller there is always a buyer. 
When everyone is buying and very few are selling, price rockets.

Start by googling each top 10 coins and read as much info on them as possible. All of them are somewhat solid in different ways. 
I’d skip all of the ICOs because it takes deeper experience in trying to understand them.

I think it will help general public to get to know cryptos, who might not even care or understand IOUs or crypto wallets.
It is a good step, since 99% of population are not die-hard crypto fanatics anyway. Those people already know crypto and can’t change the world alone.

So, the guy who had 10.000 BTC might also have lost it on Mt. Gox. He should be known as the guy who profited 2 pizzas and didn’t lose anything!
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:52:48
Ok, so guy gave 10.000 BTC for 2 pizzas. Everyone keeps telling that he would be a multi-millionaire, but what about the guy who received those 10.000 BTC? What happened to him? Lost his private key?

If there are more buyers than sellers = price goes up.
