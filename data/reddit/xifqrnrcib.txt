Sorry I miswrote the fee, it was actually 75 bits ($0.25). Do you still think that's ok? It's been a few hours.
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:58:08
Breadwallet has default fees. It's also touted as one of the best wallets by reputable sources. 
Requiring the user to wait hours or check a resource and guess at the optimal fee given the network congestion is frankly a joke. It needs to work better than this.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:40:38
Huh, ok! Thanks for checking it out.

It's a great question. Why do humans place so much value in gold? It has deep roots in our history and cultures, but in 2017 its intrinsic value is minimal. Game of Thrones put it well... it has value because people believe it has value. To take it a step further, precious metals are seen as a negatively correlated asset to the global equities market. There is a flight to "traditional" or "real" assets when financial markets struggle or show weakness. What is this a product of? Well, good financial allocation at this point, but it is rooted in fear. Fear that traditional systems are fallible and we may at any point need to retreat partially to older moneys.
But to your point, why need bitcoin when you could use say litecoin for transactions and also as "gold". This is a big question. The best answer I can give is that bitcoin has capitalized on being the first mover in crypto. Now that it is dominant, it's hard to game out how it could lose that position. You're asking the right question, unfortunately i don't know he answer.

It's an overused meme, but that doesn't make it less true: bitcoin is digital gold. Other crypto will almost definitely facilitate daily transactions.
Oh and as for the fed, no idea really. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:55:35
This was excellent. Thank you.

We're lucky that y'all are so helpful. It can be rough for a newb. There's quite a bit of reading to do. I just imagine bitcoin once the new user onboarding is on par with other tech stuff...
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:31:39
Actually I think I meant 75 μBTC? It shows me the equivalent USD in the breadwallet UI, and it says $0.25, which seems too low to get approved. Though maybe I'm wrong. It's been 2 hours with no confirmations.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:58:36
Indeed! Thank you for your help :) what a friendly bunch round here.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:34:41
Cool, thank you. Any thoughts on what happens to this transaction if it doesn't confirm?
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:37:06
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:29:50
Sorry, I meant 75 microB I guess. Not sure how to say it. But the breadwallet UI shows it as a "b" with a line through it, equivalent to $0.25.

Noob here: then how will voting occur in the future? It seems bitcoin development is officially in the hands of a few, though giving voting power to miners is the same power dynamic. I tend to align with the philosophy of core and agree with the vision, but the method seems antithetical to bitcoin. I don't know how to reconcile them.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:35:39
Default fees in many highly recommended apps.

Ok, thanks for the help.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:38:49
Does minimal inputs and outputs just mean the previous transactions on the wallet that I used? I'm a little unclear how to read the blocktrail page. Thanks again for any help :/
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:57:29
Brilliant. Thank you again, I really appreciate the help.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:50:10
Ah ok makes sense. And the second output (the leftover btc) goes back to my wallet but under a different address?

Is this a real question? Do you exist in normal society or are you a hardcore libertarian who lives in a log cabin in NH? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:56:18
One person out of a thousand who appears to have an open mind. That ratio seems about right...
Bitcoin mining is proof of work, thus it's an arms race to see who can amass the most computing power. But why? Every new block contains roughly 2000 transactions, and this occurs every 10 minutes. You have 10,000,000 TH/s of computational power computing 3 transactions per second that a raspberry pi could compute. Moreover, bitcoin is unlikely to ever utilize even 0.000001% of this computing power. At least Ethereum has a use case for their massive network, and even they are planning for proof of stake at some point in the future.

It's real relevance is that the entire world is denominated in USD, the currency is managed and steered to inflate at approx 2% per year (predictability is incredibly valuable), the biggest economy in the world by far is the US, the biggest military in the world by far is owned by the US...
I love bitcoin. I own bitcoin. I am not a hater. I think BTC will be 100k in a few years. But the hardcore libertarian psycho anarchist bullshit is too much sometimes, guys. I love you, but please try to exist in the real world here.
Bitcoin could absolutely replace gold. And when second layer solutions finally come online, we could see it replace existing payment structures. But take an economics 101 class and learn about why a managed currency is so vital to our economy, and why bitcoin can't and will never replace that. It is not a replacement for USD and we shouldn't want it to be.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:32:59
I agree with you and your post is more or less correct. However maybe the biggest difference between bitcoin and say USD is that USD is backed by the power of the US govt. So while the entire scheme does still depend on humans believing other humans about where the value lies... BTC doesn't actually have any real world assets backing it up, besides the network (which is substantial).
Also money is not a bubble. That's psychobabble.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:55:14
Which is a monumental, unconscionable amount of overkill for the current specs of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:50:21
The latter. Fixed, thanks

In this case, the USD is most certainly backed by the US govt and military.

A. I'm in neither demographic you guessed
B. I'm heavily invested in btc and crypto and am rich by any standard
C. If you want crypto to succeed in the real world and not simply in your portfolio (and you have a semblance of basic knowledge of economics), you would see how detrimental and antithetical this meme is to that goal
But please, bitcoinslayer, keep the dank maymays flowing.

@_date: 2017-10-25 18:04:57
Yes it’s a huge sunk cost, and hardware is always improving and new rigs are purchased regularly. A full accounting of mining operations would be useful to really understand the situation. You’re not convincing a thoughtful person with surface level claims of +600% or income analogies. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:47:57
And the cost of the parts and labor? There is more to this. I’m not defending miners, I’m defending a full accounting of the situation. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:10:22
So why not lay that out? Claiming that an increase of price means a directly proportional increase in mining profits ignores, seemingly intentionally, a huge amount of the situation. The way this OP was written was so authoritarian and yet narrow. 
To be clear, I want BTC to continue to be bitcoin. I think forks are disruptive and generally bad for cryptos like bitcoin. I don't want the miners to have any more control or make any more money. But when these are the types of posts coming out of this sub, I feel a sense that I'm missing something more sinister. This is almost propaganda.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:16:03
If P is the probability you lose your bitcoin for any reason (theft, loss of keys, etc), it becomes a matter of how much time and money is it worth for incremental reductions of P. iOS is much more secure thank a windows based PC for example. Obviously a hardware wallet gives you the lowest P in most scenarios, but at a cost.
Your statement about “why bother with crypto if you only have a few thousand” is misguided and misinformed, not to say pompous and self serving.
The vast majority of people who first invested in crypto started off with small amounts. Mass adoption requires many small retail “coinbase”  investors experimenting with bitcoin as a store of wealth. If you expect mass adoption of bitcoin through exclusively transactions of five figures or more, you’re going to be disappointed.

Everyone always parrots this, but in reality it's not universally the best advice. If you have thousands of dollars in BTC, yes you should probably have a hardware wallet. But paper wallets are more than acceptable for smaller amounts, especially if you have good net security habits. Alternately, breadwallet on ios is a great choice too.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:39:46
Here's a pretty good discussion. Ultimately I moved to Gemini because of their customer support and ease of deposit.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:04:28
Please ignore the swarm who will tell you "hardware wallet at all costs". If you are dipping your toes into the water with an investment of a few thousand dollars or less, it's fine to use coinbase. If you're dealing with higher amounts you may want to consider hardware wallets, or if you are strictly buy/hold for life, then a paper wallet would work too.
A hardware wallet will cost you ~$100, and requires you to hide/store your recovery keys somewhere extremely safe, and not in the same house as your hardware wallet (fire = poof bitcoin gone). Many people who have hardware wallets and paper backups in their house don't realize that their coins are potentially less secure than if they simply left them on coinbase. 
If you're just starting out, coinbase (or Gemini, which is what I would recommend) is totally fine.

What's odd to me is that you're purporting to be an expert and are clearly acting as if you have intellectual authority on the subject, but you're making a freshman bitcoin error (repeatedly) of conflating ticker price increase with miner profit increase. I'm not on either side, but posts like this make me scratch my head.
