You don't say?

Worth it in the sense that if bitcoin failed I would have "lost" 10k. Obviously any amount of bitcoin over original investment is worth it.

I was never looking to get rich. Im not really looking to get involved in bitcoin now. It was just silly for me to think that this currency would flatline around the worth of the american Dollar. I was surprised when it hit 2 dollars. Then when it hit 4 I was like... well damn that could have been the 60k I ended up getting. Then they hit 10$ and I was like "NOOOOOOO" what have I done. Now 2 years later, I literally lose sleep thinking that I should have taken a chance. Fuck man, even If I took 20k cash and 15,000btw it would have been a smarter move. I just didn't know enough about BTC at the time. That was probably my biggest downfall. I probably should have done more than 2 days worth of research. Ah well.

Nothing in my post talks about "almost" anything. Nor does it say it was 3 years ago. Nor does it say I was interested in "buying" anything.   
  
 &gt;Again, you weren't "almost" about to accept that offer because... you didn't.  
  
Again you choose to quote "almost" like I made this statement in my post. I didn't almost do anything. What happened was I was made an offer. I considered it. I declined. And then I regretted my choice down the line with the success of bitcoin  
    


  
Bingo. Now your comment is a little more on par with how I am feeling. I never claimed I "almost" anything. I never claimed I had a chance to "buy" anything. All I stated was 30,000BTC were offered to me a few years ago, and looking at its success today it makes me question the path I chose. While I admit I did post this as a slight ego boost. The "You did what was best for your family" definitely squelches the shitty feelings a bit.   
  
The offer was real and legitimate. I chose not to take it. I think that differentiates itself slightly from the "Oh man I heard about bit coins in 2009 and was thinking about buying then but didn't". Not by much, but my choice felt slightly less trivial than that.

I appreciate it. Theres thousands of variables to investing so its nearly impossible to say what id really have in my hands today if I took this offer. I get envious of the guys who buy even 100 coins a year or two ago then "forget" there password for there wallet. Im not much of a gambler and even my Roth IRA urks me a bit considering it an "investment". The only thing that has kept me interested in bitcoin has always been that missed opportunity. The people telling me I should buy in now I guess really aren't grasping the whole scenario. Im not an investor, I'm not someone looking to get rich, I'm not somebody who will buy or sell or trade bitcoins. Im simply someone who was offered 30,000 bitcoins who now sees the opportunity that passed *if* **I left them untouched for the entire time**. I simply just need to move on and stop dwelling on it. Im slightly obsessed with LTC right now seeing it at similar prices that BTC were back then. But even then I can't bring myself to put any of my money into an ALT coin. I'll continue to follow bitcoin with interest and ill most likely start participating around the same time as the majority. When almost all businesses accept them and I don't have to drive an hour to make face to face transactions.

Is...is this a joke? Because using heroin is super intelligent.

Thanks, this is the most helpful thing posted to this thread so far.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:02:04
Yeah I think thats the bigger thing Im bummed about. Even 1000 coins plus 50k would have been so worth it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:27:11
Theres no real way of knowing that. I haven't touched a cent in my IRA that was started around the same time. I have no clue if I would have sold them or not.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:08:20
2$ a coin basically.
@_date: 2013-09-28 00:14:14
Ive been reading up and following bitcoin since... 2009? Sometime around there. Been wanting to jump in this whole time. If I wait any longer, I feel like it will get harder for me to participate.  
  
It might be a "grossly broad stereotype" but theres truth in my statement. Im not saying every person on SR is  a "barely articulate heroin addict" ,but it makes me feel shitty that I have less ability then the people stated.
