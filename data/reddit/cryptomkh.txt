This is what happens when narrative changes from "let's change the global economy by spreading bitcoin" to let's hodl "digital gold" and use fiat.
Bitcoin should be used everywhere and drive new economic opportunities. Now, the community itself is toxifying public perception of bitcoin.

Tbh everyone is confused about what fiat means.
Strictly speaking cryptocurrencies are fiat currencies too, because they are not backed by a real asset. It is just a term that turned out to be convenient to use.
It would be more correct to say about government issued fiat currencies and community issued fiat crypto currencies.

The OP was trying to highlight benefits of the joke Bitcoin Core over Bitcoin Cash, while the legacy Bitcoin Core is even worse on *the same metrics*. That’s ironic, isn’t it? 
Full nodes is a separate issue, I did not touch it, neither OP did.

You have inadvertently crushed BTC maximalism. A joke Bitcoin Core is better than the legacy Bitcoin Core - this is what I can read from your post ��

Where is Exhibit 1? The lawsuit above which is marked as Exhibit 1 refers to the Exhibit 1 but does not contain it.

I see your point but I would not say that developers were on the miners’ side in that case. I’d say that the majority of developers and users were on one side and majority of miners on the other. 
I edited the post to add a link to a medium post which illustrates this very well.
I am thinking about the situation when both miners and developers agree on an issue and push through a change. This will be quite difficult to resist.
Bitcoin is definitely well-governed, but I think it is not decentralized in a way many people think.

Smarter than your comment though.

That’s why I mentioned the two entities. What if developers and miners have consensus and change the network as they wish? What users can do?
That’s a genuine question, I may be missing something.
