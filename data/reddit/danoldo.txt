They have rampant homelessness... however, if you decriminalize everything and make the minimum amount of theft $1,000.00 or more in order to be prosecuted, no one calls the police because they won’t enforce small crime.  
Drug use, defecating in public, theft, happen at epidemic proportions but they don’t enforce it.  You can literally shoot and kill someone in public then claim ignorance and get off Scott free.

This is literally a little maddening.  (BTW, thank you all for your input, its just me that is pulling my hair out).  Do any of you have a clear and concise answer for the following questions?
1) Bitcoin gold is an airdrop, correct?
2) When will this airdrop take place?
3) How do I claim it?
4) If this is already answered somehwere clear and concisely, could you please point me in the correct direction?
