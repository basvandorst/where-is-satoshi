You can't simply transfer 1kk Euros into GBP without getting asked questions. There exist money laundering laws which apply to Bitcoin as well. At first I'd recommend to inform yourself about the laws which apply to Bitcoin in your jurisdiction before you take further steps.

Yes, you are right. I didn't read about the audit procedure as it didn't affect me. This is really bad practice without a trusted third party or a signed message from that Bitcoin address. Would have been easier to understand if you wrote that first instead of a comparison to Wild Cat banking. Something like: "We need trusted third party auditing to have a healthy bitcoin ecosystem."

The next reward halving doesn't happen unexpected, so every big mining institution can calculate with that. The thing is that they are highly dependent on the bitcoin price to pay e.g for electricity, hardware etc.
Usually the reward halving means an increase in bitcoin value as there will be less "new" coins for sale. I won't take this for granted as there are many more factors which determine the price. 
Me for myself would be more afraid if we had a sudden price crash and stay on this level for a while. I'm not sure if this risk is fully calculable and if the big mining institutions have an emergency plan for that.
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:05:35
They charge 50 Euro/BTC over market price and send out transactions without a fee? Don't use them again ever. I'd recommend more serious exchanges like Bitstamp or Kraken. Better do some research or ask someone else over here which exchange is recommended for Europeans.

The bitcoin address is the pseudonym. If you pay me with bitcoin from an address, I now know that this address belongs to you. I'm now able to watch every transaction you do (and did in the past) from this address and if you send some coins to a publicly known address before I'd be able to see this within the blockchain.
To be save from nosey neighbors it'd be sufficient to use a different address everytime you send coins. Some wallets do this by default. In order to withstand a deeper analysis you'd have to use advanced techniques.

This is an interesting theory but I don't think that the fluctuations in price were caused by the daily supply of coins. It was more influenced by large and many small holders of bitcoins who reacted to different market situations. The constant downward pressure from newly generated coins is just an additional factor and won't decisively help to control the price fluctuations.

It could happen that you download a virus/malware which steals your wallet data and logs your password with a key logger. This scenario is more likely if you use windows and less if you use linux. However, if you are not one of the people who use to get every malware available and you are cautious this isn't a real problem.

password protected but if you get ratted they might have a keylogger. If you are really paranoid or on windows then I'd recommend a bootable usb stick with linux and electrum for the majority of your funds. It's the best compromise between usability and security.

A paper wallet is a good alternative and very secure for long time storage or if you don't have a computer.

* first question: There is always a way to make it more secure. The question is more, "how paranoid are you?" :D
* second question: There are two ways with electrum to backup your wallet. One is to write down the seed and save it in a text file on your encrypted usb. The other way is to backup the default_wallet file which is in /home/yourusername/.electrum/wallets. This file is encrypted with a password in contrast to your seed which can restore your wallet even if you forget your password.
* third question: Electrum is a lightweight client and you don't have to download the entire blockchain. It uses a determenistic seed (12 words) to create and restore all your keys.There is no real disadvantage.

@_date: 2014-03-07 22:46:15
It is just a logic step to regulate payments that are off their usual payment systems/their protocol. This happens to avoid fraud, to collect their fees, protect themselves from lawsuits and more reasons. 
So the headline ist still: "They didn't implement Bitcoin into their regular payment system."

This works if your Bitcoin is independent from the Dollar, as Gyft simply does a conversion. Belive it or not, we are not at that stage yet.
If adoption is widespread and accepted directly, there would be a higher probability to switch to Bitcoin pricing for goods in case of a crash (might also depend on the nature of the crash).

The problem is that Mr Frappuccino doesn't know himself how the bitcoins went missing.
First it was all caused by evil transaction malleability. Then he found some coins by chance and now someone went into his bureau and stole the privkeys around his neck while Mr Frappucino was sleeping at his desk being exhausted from twiddling his thumbs.
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:26:58
I really love bitcoin, but I personally wouldn't recommend to accept 'only' bitcoin  for payment. A better way to give an incentive for payments in bitcoin, is to pass forward the money you save due reduced fees, to your bitcoin-customers.
@_date: 2014-05-27 10:41:53
Many miners didn't switch to 0.9.1. Miners aren't dependent of fees for now due high block reward. (Edit: It increases their income as they are seeking for max. profit, this could explain that they didn't switch) Doesn't this mean, that the user can't influence the price of transaction fees by demand for faster transaction for now? So the income from fee has to exceed the income from block reward to give users influence. This can be achieved through more users/transactions or decline in block reward in the future. So when block reward declines, a set minimum fee would influence the balance of the "free market of transaction fees" when it's set too high. I think the development of transaction fees is one of the interesting experiments of bitcoin. I have to think about this again later on. :D

I'm aware of the flaws, it was just a bit of fantasizing. This was more about the idea to connect something like your electrical toothbrush ( DNA analysis to proof :D ) with a reward system. 
All these things would need a lot of technology and maybe something like multisig colored coins can prevent clients from trading. Now you'd need a private key tied to an ID, DNA etc.
As you see, it is just a mind game but to say "but certainly this is not use case for colored coins, sorry" is a bit rash.

I still don't get how you access your bitcoin? Do you have the blockchain wallet on your phone?
 
Usually yes, you'd scan the qr code, click send and the bitcoins would be send via internet to the merchants address(simplified). But you can open your blockchain wallet on  in your browser and send the bitcoin to the address the merchant provides you. Most times you can find it below the QR code. It starts with 1...(a few letters and numbers), copy&amp;paste it and voila.

* 1) I'd recommend Electrum from electrum.org . You get a 12 word seed at first which gives you the ability to restore your wallet even if you lose your password or your computer. Write the seed down and store it on a safe place.
* 2) By using a website you give the address and the power over your funds to someone else. They could run away every time or go bankrupt. One of the most trusted is in my opinion blockchain.info. Always read the instructions and save the necessary backup files, phrases etc.
* 3) I didn't get any bitcoins stolen but I have to say that I don't download everything someone promotes. Be cautious with phishing mails, programs you don't know or not everyone is using. Don't download things from links you get send from random persons.
* 4) You don't need to do that. If you use the wallet I suggested, it gets encrypted when you enter your password. Don't run a wallet without using a password.
* 5) Cold storage means that you store your bitcoins on a device or peace of paper and none of the programs that created your bitcoin addresses was connected to the internet ever.
Final note: I'd recommend to get a small amount of bitcoins first to play around. When you feel comfortable with sending and storing you can buy more if you liked it. ;)

Why? These are just randomly generated addresses. You shouldn't use this service to generate an address with an easy passphrase like "correct horse battery staple" "mypassword123" or other commonly used words, phrases, sentences. 
Edit: was a bit unclear, I thought he wants to check if the address of the person he sends bitcoin is listed there. I wouldn't recommend at all to use a site online to generate a brainwallet as there is always the possibility they record this process like this site does.

So why doesn't it shift the discussion to security? As my risk-average cost depends among other things on security? Bitcoin, for now far from perfect, is in my view just an attempt  to solve this problem from another direction. The chargeback process has indirect costs for the user of credit cards if you look at it from a wider  perspective and thus has an effect on his purchasing power. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:26:44
I also asked myself before if it is possible and secure to built a "virtual machine wallet" So you just start your wallet and it starts a wallet within a virtual machine. I don't know if this would be possible or bring an improvement in terms of security against viruses. What do you think about it as an expert?

There are many problems with micro transactions on-chain. DOS attacks, transaction fee (necessary incentive to include transactions when block reward goes to zero), blockchain bloating. It's a mixture of technological and economic reasons.  For now micro transactions are better processed off-chain. One example for this is changetip which is a reddit tip bot for tiny tip amounts. All in all this means that you would need one centralized service to do micro payments all over the internet for different use cases to make it feasible. Another possibility is to use another blockchain technology coin/altcoin with less value if only we could agree on one of these 10kk alternatives...

First of all, it is your assumption/speculation what mainstream will do. Second, I really don't want to rewrite the first quote I posted, please read it. If the thing we define as Bitcoin won't get accepted from mainstream then Bitcoin won't be used by mainstream. If they call it Bitcoin or Altcoin doesn't matter. I don't understand were you are heading? Do you want to force people to accept your currency and make them unable to change it? You probably need to invent something centralized, if this currency hits mainstream is another question.

I'm only aware of one hard fork (maybe more? enlighten me?) and that happened when a new version that accidentally forked the network and made it possible to create coins out of thin air was introduced. Obviously there were not a lot of people that loved this version. :D If you like to run this version with your friends, I'm sure you can do it. 
Edit: Happened a bit different but the point is: There was never a fork that changed one of the primary features of bitcoin so that you would call the current protocol an altcoin.

Do you even read? 
Again: 
As I said before the bitcoin price isn't solely based on supply and demand.
But we know the total amount, the current amount of coins and amount of daily mined coins.
The supply does decrease when the mining reward is halving. The supply changes from 25coins/~10min -&gt; 12,5coins/10min. I'm pretty sure big mining institutions don't speculate with bitcoin as it is very a very volatile product. So they'll have to sell almost instantly. 
If we assume that the demand stays the same, we have now less supply at constant demand on the exchanges.(Price is not solely based on supply and demand,  quote you left out: 
"I won't take this for granted as there are many more factors which determine the price.") 
So what do you think will usually happen??

This is bad news because of the extra fee. 


Yes, there are two distinct kinds of additional fees:






 
IMO they are not helping the cause at all and should stay away from Bitcoin. Which costs do they try to compensate with this? The $30 a month for BitPay? They charge as much as CC and Paypal for Bitcoin payment.
Anyways I'm still waiting for Kaufland, Lidl, Aldi, Rewe to accept Bitcoins to be happy :D
It's getting even better.


Which security reasons? They act as if they don't use BitPay at all, or does BitPay offer different conditions for Germany? edit2: I know the reason for the last paragraph. It is not about security but about their choice to use the professional package which is limited to $10000 a day. What a dishonest company.

I am sure the average user doesn't care about decantralization or centralization. Think of Apple, their sucess was based on "it is easy to use and looks good". The mainstream average Joe doesn't care if Apple choses which apps they are allowed to use.

3) No, not for the merchant, it is just a confirmation for a future payment. Debit card is a bit faster as credit card in terms of the "real" money transaction. And guess what there can still happen chargebacks afterwards. Supermarkets have a system to block debit cards from customers which paid with a debit card and there was a chargeback afterwards.

With services like blockchain.info you can see if the transaction went through by looking up your reciving bitcoin address from the electrum client.

Yes of course we need both, I never questioned that. 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC I don't think you can really change this. You just said decimals are easier to understand than big numbers.

Bitcoin is not anonymous. It is the fault of the media that everyone is thinking that. In fact, bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous. This means if you know who owns a certain address you will as well know from where he gets and where he sends transactions to [if you can match these addresses with an identity as well]. Every transaction is openly visible in the blockchain where the entire transaction history of the protocol is saved. To sum up, we can say that if you don't know who owns the address it is kind of anonymous. (I wont go into detail about special data mining, statistic analysis methods which are or are in theory able to identify an owner)

Ok, I think I got it. To be fully secure I'd need to create a keypair on an offline machine where it gets additionally encrypted with your encryption and after that send you that version. And the app follows the same client side principle without access from your servers.

Agree. In my opinion BitStamp just tries to identify potential high risk customers. It is their duty to do this in order to fullfill the AML requirements. Obviously they can't tell customers on their list, that they are more suspicious to money laundering than someone else and therefore get an extended questionnaire. I could be wrong but regarding the last news of subpoenas for exchanges this seems to fit.

The Bitcoin Core client pre-creates a set of 100 Addresses if I recall it correctly. This means you have to backup every 100th outgoing transaction. I for myself prefer deterministic wallets like electrum. It uses a seed to generate every future possible address. You can easily watch your wallet from outside with your Master Public Key.

There is a reason why these pyramid schemes are forbidden in many countries (e.g. Germany, Austria, Swityerland). There are too many fools who want to try it out of greediness and blame someone else for their loss afterwards. 
IMO education would be better than regulation but there are too many greedy fools on the other hand.

Really? I can't believe you. It would be so much easier to say in bits if the wallets would support this.

That is not exactly what I wanted to know but thank you anyways for this detailed explanation. 
I was more interested in how we can solve the task of security in the future. There is and will be a real problem for the average user to keep his funds secure from wallet stealing malware. There are already some approaches. For example the Trezor hardware wallet solves this problem with an external system. My question was how this could be solved software sided and being plug&amp;play for the people who are none tech savvy. If I understood your answer correctly, virtual machines can't provide an easy solution. I meant hiding all the tech stuff, click on your wallet and it starts within a virtual machine. 
So hardware wallets on sticks or two-factor authentication for your desktop wallet seem to be the direction it will take? The average person won't bother with learning security, they like plug&amp;play otherwise we won't have so much Apple fanatics. :D

Stable? 
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:13:04
You didn't understand my answer. If you or the person you send bitcoins to, uses an ordinary wallet software then your key won't be listed there. You don't have to check there every time before you send bitcoins. 
If you or the person you send bitcoins to, generated their address with a service like this and/or used a unsave passphrase to generate the keys, it is possible someone has access to your funds. It is like  where your privatekey (key to bitcoins) is generated from a word/phrase you chose and everyone can do the same like you did. So simply don't do it.

First argument is valid if someone fraudulently uses my bitcoin private key. But this shifts the discussion to bitcoin's security which is for now at least superior to credit cards. 
Your second point would be a better one, if we discussed eBay. Amazon stores and ships a majority(?) of its products on behalf of the merchant. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find numbers of the products stored by them to underline this.

There are many ways to solve this without stealing. Easy access is just a justification so they don't feel like the scumbags they are. If you are a hacker it might be easy to hack an exchange and steal everything, in a way "served right in front of you", but it is still a theft.

I think in most cases the person carrying your bags did something which needs more effort. If you get a tip for a post you would have written anyway every amount is welcome. If you provide decent content which took you quite some time to write up and helped the person then Yes the tipping amount should reflect that. Getting tips for things I would have written anyway, no matter how small they are doesn't make me feel bad, over the time they accumulate. If the amount is to small for you and kind of insulting you then tip it forward to someone who is able to appreciate the tip.
Edit: Transactions are off chain, no blockchain was ever harmed

It won't have a great marketing effect anymore but why not accept bitcoin? You don't have to bother with chargebacks and you have the choice to keep bitcoin, or instantly trade them for fiat. You should look into coinbase or bitpay if you want a hassle free integration.
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:15:21
There are different solutions. You can share a private key with your desktop wallet and your smartphone wallet. This is less secure but easy to do. Create a paper wallet from your private key and import it with mycelium app.
Another way which is a saver is to store your bitcoins on one or more bip38 encrypted paperwallets and import them into your mobile wallet if you need more money on the go. You can have multiple copies of the same paperwallets as backups, in case you lose your briefcase or wherever you store them.

A change you described would need a hard fork. If anyone uses the old version and the alternative chain it would be an altcoin. There was no hard fork between 9.0 and 9.1 
Think of it as an incompatible version to the previous one.

Company A somehow reminds me of a bank when I read your description. The question is if this solution would be cheaper if you have the same expense for approving these transactions. Company A won't do this for free. So what's the advantage here to do this with bitcoin?
If there is a way to do pull transactions on a protocol basis (?) the major problem could be "request-spam". It is a very interesting topic and I think multisig isn't the solution but I'm open for discussion. :)

"...merchants pass on (forward) reduced costs to customers." I don't know if it is my bad english or if you don't read carefully. 
In Europe I pay for credit cards a monthly fee and for debit cards a fee for transactions, as well as the merchant pays for the transaction and he pays for the whole payment system.

**Health Insurance Token**
A health insurance company could emit "Healthy Lifestyle Coins". Every time you go for a run your smartphone app gives you some coins dependent of your performance. Every time you do a routine check-up at your doctors you get some coins. Exercise machines in the gym issue coins dependent on your performance. Your fridge scans its content and you get coins based on the amount of healthy food it finds. (...I could go on for hours :D )
