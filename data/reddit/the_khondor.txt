That's what I said
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:25:02
OK, thanks for the insight
@_date: 2016-04-13 17:57:02
Yeah, your site helped me a lot, but I can't even get a foot in the door (so to speak).  
Just the concept of real money for "imaginary currency" breaks the deal.  
This must be Bitcoins biggest hurdle to becoming mainstream
@_date: 2016-04-05 04:26:04
Then that is why. You cant transfer anything until they verify your identity  i had this same issue but once i sent in a picture of my id and selfie everything was fine

I second AirVPN. Been using them well over a year. When used correctly it's as safe and secure as you need

Your post (and a few others) have just showed me how further ahead I am/was then the majority of the people I know personally. I never took the time to realize that fact. I was the first person I knew to have a Dreamcast, I was on the internet in late '96 when there wasnt even the term "internet". Hell I remember being the first person to have a DVD player, my local video store had just gotten in it's very first DVD, The Matrix. I took the box to the counter to rent it, and the lady was flabbergasted that someone actually had a player and knew what it was.  
  
 I didn't feel as passionately about those things as I do Bitcoin, guess I'll have to do like always, go along and wait for everyone else to catch up.  
Sorry to rant, thanks for the reply
@_date: 2016-04-20 22:07:52
I understand that, that wasn't the question.

***update 
  
OK got everything working. Seems since i created my account on circle after midnight there was nobody to verify my ID, i didn't get that email until earlier today, got it done and everything is good to go.  
Thanks for everyones input
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:15:55
Good info here, thanks
@_date: 2016-04-26 01:07:02
How about major fast food chains? Oh man, if McDonald's accepted it.
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:22:41
Yeah I was thinking about using an old iphone
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:53:21
It depends on what you are using it for, if you've set everything correctly like stopping ip leaks, set firewall rules, port configurations etc
@_date: 2016-04-14 00:53:19
Thanks for the replying everyone
@_date: 2016-04-26 01:04:27
That's what I was thinking, some mass market retailer like them or walmart
@_date: 2016-04-03 13:19:19
***Update***  
  
The first transaction failed, and i got a email from circle saying they could not compete the transaction  no other details, so i tried again with an increased transfer amount and the exact same thing happened.

Your site is wonderful. Thank you for helping a bitcoin newb
@_date: 2016-03-16 20:43:54
Oh nice,  +1 subscriber. Thanks, I'm sure you will be hearing from me again

A gift for my Wife as her birthday is coming up.

Sadly not available to those in the U.S.

Well Picasso didn't paint with the intentions of his works to be used as currency.
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:16:58
When i first told my wife we should invest in Bitcoin she had no problem with it. Since the recent surge in value she is now telling me i should have purchased more and if the value dips again to buy more this time, but hold what we have for now.  
  
I love this woman.  
@_date: 2016-06-05 05:06:43
Very nice, thank you
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:14:53
That answer itself poses questions.  
 Getting rich with what, the fiat everyone claims will be worthless?   
 Getting rich off of the "suckers" who believe bitcoin has value?  
Not trying to ruffle feathers, just looking for insight.
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:26:51
I'm in the same boat as OP. Now sure what to do. My instinct is to hold and even buy more.
@_date: 2016-06-05 05:04:05
Yes it does
@_date: 2016-06-04 21:29:04
I usually don't get to lol in this sub, but that was a good one. Well done
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:26:29
Sounds like the Duke brothers. lol

Thank you

Good for you. Keep in mind, the IRS will be watching. Don't have any solution for you, but I hope to have that problem one day.  
Best of luck to you

Low? When and Where?   
  
I just tried to buy a $20 gift card with some BTC, and the fee was like $12
@_date: 2016-06-14 22:56:25
@_date: 2016-06-04 23:39:53
Now that is a very good analogy. Thanks
@_date: 2016-06-05 05:08:32
That was very helpful, thank you
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:19:09
Can you elaborate on the "dust" statement you made? I scanned the post you linked but didn't find anything helpful. How does it cost me more in fees just because I have had some small deposits?
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:04:40
Be careful, if you plan on staying on government assistance you could put those benefits at risk. 
Unless you plan on putting the accounts in someone elses name, they will find out
@_date: 2016-06-04 23:42:16
Thank you for your input
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:53:07
Ok, that clears it up. Thanks so much for the explanation
@_date: 2016-05-10 01:02:16
Next time use the drive-thru. I deposit cash into my mother's account all the time without one piece of info other than the account number. No ID or questions asked
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:08:34
@_date: 2016-05-15 04:52:27
I had this same issue when i first joined. The problem was that i didn't reply to the confirmation email when I opened my account. Did you get one of those yet when you set up?
@_date: 2016-05-08 01:21:46
Very informative, thank you
@_date: 2016-05-15 04:35:34
How long has your account been open with circle?
@_date: 2016-05-15 05:01:41
Don't be hard on yourself, I'm not too far ahead of you in knowledge on the subject. There was one email in particular, it had a link I had to click to confirm my account activation. That's the email I'm taking about. 
I had failed to do that so nothing i transferred would complete, it would all fail.  I could buy btc just fine, but i couldn't transfer it anywhere.  
That's may only idea, if it's not that then someone else may have an idea
