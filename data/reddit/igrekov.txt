Thank you for the concise answer! How does that differ from, say, if I were to have sold all my BTC via Coinbase a week ago, and then re-invested today while the value has plummeted?

I just read an article about shorting and I"m still not quite sure how it would work with Bitcoin. A lot of terms that you guys use I'm also at a loss for understanding. Does the subreddit FAQ explain most of these terms as it pertains to BTC, or am I just financially illiterate?
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:28:42
No way.

It's like these people think that crime just appears out of nowhere. Good luck with your sovereign citizen fantasy when someone robs you for $1.50 to get something to eat in your dystopian paradise.

Thank you, friend. Fellow noob here wondering the same question. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 08:33:36
I'm still sort of a noob myself, currently trying to set up a private cold storage. 
Here are the very very basics as they pertain to me and you:
People/companies "mine" coins using computers and math. Who cares how or why, since it is no longer profitable to do it yourself. 
There is a finite limit to these coins. I don't know the number and it doesn't matter. Point is there's built in scarcity. No printing more bitcoins. 
It's secretish in that your public address can be known and seen by everyone, but no one can spend it cause they don't have your private key, and your public address is in no way tied to your name. Nearly impossible to trace. 
Because of the promise in the system as a very privacy friendly way to transfer money and because of its security (impossible to duplicate bitcoins) and because of built in scarcity (only gonna ever be X amount of coins), people are betting on these coins being traded by everyone (or nearly everyone) someday. Most people, like me, have bought some amount of bitcoin from a bitcoin exchange, which is just a company that buys and sells bitcoin and has capital to back it up. Between scarcity, demand, and people using real money, bitcoin has value. Really no different from any government issuing money and saying "this has value."

From the recent Change My View thread:


Most stocks right now that you buy in companies off things like the New York Stock Exchange do not pay dividends, ie there are not quarterly or annual payouts of profits to stockholding investors. Furthermore, there is nothing necessarily linking stock value to profits. For instance it is entirely possible that a company loses money, but its stock value still goes up anyway. This leads to a certain divorce from reality in some ways. The stock itself is worthless (it pays you nothing), beyond what a 2nd person is willing to pay for it for whatever reason
So why the heck can say Tesla's stock value go up like this over the past year, when during that same time period they have posted losses &gt;$200 million each quarter!? Now you might say, its because people think in 10 years Tesla might be making large profits. Sure. Except I would also say, in such a scenario, is that piece of (now electronic) paper that sits in your vault paying you any more money w/ the company making millions in profits versus millions in losses? They answer is NO! Its still paying out $0 in dividends. In fact its only value is that now other people will want to buy the stock, and then sell it to someone else on the thought they will expect SOMEONE ELSE to want it for more money if quarterly reports look good. Why!? Because thats just what people are "supposed to do". But implicitly if someone declared tomorrow stocks can no longer be traded, then you still have a worthless piece of paper in a profit or loss scenario(because it doesnt pay dividends).
Do you kind of get the shell game that goes on in real stocks? Its the exact same speculation that goes on w/ bitcoin. People want bitcoin, because they believe that other people will want it based on the thought it will keep going up. People want Tesla stock on the thought that OTHER people will want it due to the thought that if earnings go up a 3rd person will want it for even more (even though increased earnings in a vacuum doesnt help or hurt the owner of the stock if he cant trade it to a 3rd party)
I recommend you take a look at it:

"Especially **when** it is not sustainable due to excessive resource consumption," I think you meant to say. 
And while I agree there are plenty of factors outside of the Fed's (or any other central bank's control), saying that it's pointless to try, or that all growth is just shadow money created by debt and banks sounds like a bit much. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 04:59:43
And controlled inflation is part of any healthy and growing economy. What's your point?

They also had people analyze the writing style and it turns out they're not really all that similar 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:47:46
It's basically a copy paste of the Bitcoin blockchain at a certain time. 
When the Bitcoin Cash fork happened I was automatically given the exact same amount of Bitcoin Cash that I had in Bitcoin. 
I transferred all BTC to a new wallet address, then used a Bitcoin Cash supported wallet to restore the original/old address that used to have all my BTC in them. Since Bitcoin Cash used the exact same everything, including addresses, moving Bitcoin after the fork had no effect on the Bitcoin Cash in the address. From there it was just a matter of finding an exchange that supported Bitcoin Cash and dumping that shit.

Coinbase still hasn't (to my knowledge) released customers' BCH.
localbitcoins apparently just stole all of their customers'.
I consider myself reasonably technical and I wouldn't have been able to figure out how to get my BCH without a handy web article.
It's not super easy to get your BCH, therefore a lot of people have probably just made the mental note that they have some and to do something about it at some point. All this BCH on the sidelines/in wallets: artificial scarcity.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:26:08
Maybe. I think laziness and disinterest ("Might as well HODL everything just in case BCH prevails over BTC") plays more of a factor than being unable to buy it. And from what I hear, most who ARE buying it are doing so to short. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.

To be fair, banking info isn't anonymous. And a centralized company has the final say on that canceled payment.
