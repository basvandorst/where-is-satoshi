Thank you for your very well written and informative answer!
I think you may have slightly misunderstood the intent of my post, I wasn't attempting to directly link sex with love and trust; rather the opposite, I was attempting to draw what I believe to be a connection between our genetic predispositions for partnership &amp; sexuality and the love &amp; trust that are essential elements in the intimate relationships we build.
Being vulnerable is one of, if not the biggest point itself of a relationship imo, discussing issues that you don't trust anyone else with, opening up about your emotions and displaying your insecurities and weaknesses. I believe that if an average person doesn't have another human being at their side that takes on this role, they can't be fully happy on a personal level.
I hope this kind of cleared up what I originally intended

Sure, I'm usually a big enemy of generalization as well, I guess it was just easier to write lol. My point was aimed at your "average person"
Anyhow, if you feel like it you can read some of the other comments I made, I explained a bit of my thought process there and I love to hear other opinions about such topics

I think I know what you mean. I used to have those as well but at the end of the day I slumped back into depression as per usual. If you don't mind me asking, are you in your situation voluntarily or due to other issues?
I ended up isolated due to severe social phobia and avoidance behavior, couldn't even answer the phone without having a small panic attack. If you feel like it we can exchange a little in PMs as well, hit me up anytime

Please elaborate, would love to hear your thoughts on the matter

Absolutely true though look up whether they simply didn't have a partner or were actually living in isolation

I can't tell whether you're making a joke or not but cats and dogs actually kind of work. Not nearly as well as another human whom you trust conditionlessly but they do help a lot!

Thank you, I'm actually doing really good now, I'm planning to go back to school in a couple of months, which used to me anti-christ haha.
If you ever feel like venting to someone, hit me up anytime

I think asexuality is only related to the physical aspects of sexuality, I've seen an interview of an asexual couple waaaaay back. If I'm wrong please correct me!

I used to live the exact scenario you are describing and it's a personal hell. For basically 4 years I lived in my room with barely any contact to other people. I had tricked myself into thinking that I am happy this way, that I am naturally a loner, that I don't need affection or affirmation.
It was a lie I told myself, not more and not less. Telling myself that and *choosing to believe it* made that situation bearable for me, at the time. The lie was a bandaid and now that I'm out of this hell I can finally admit that I was closer to death, a vegetative state, than living. Not having anybody except for the reinforcing, self-deceptive lies I told myself every single day changed the way I viewed the world, mostly in a negative way.
The extent of my progress within a little more than a year after somehow luring someone into the dumpster fire that is my life has been astonishing to me personally. While there, I felt like it was something that *couldn't* end, that would never end and that it's something that I just have to come to terms with, somehow.
But it's not. It's fixable, pretty easily actually.
That's why I believe that no regular person can be truly happy entirely alone; and this is coming from someone who used to have the word "loner" on  of self-descriptive words
edit: loner isn't an adjective.

My theory is that we, as humans, can't be truly happy without a good partner. No matter what anybody says, we need others around us.

That's an amazing piece of info, thanks, got an article of some sort as well?
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:14:35
I absolutely agree, though I think that personal happiness can't be fully achieved if you don't have anybody whom you love and trust more than life itself.
Look at it this way, our biological goal, the biological sense of life is to procreate. That's quite literally our main goal in life, from a purely practical point of view. It would just seem weird if our partners aren't somehow interwoven into other aspects of our lifes that carry a similar *personal* magnitude, particularly rewarding and motivational aspects of our behavior

Cheers mate!
So if I have, say 660€ on my account, it should be enough to pay for the fee, right?
Thanks again :)
