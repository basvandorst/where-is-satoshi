You also need to verify the public key that created the release signature. You'll need to go speak to the devs in person or via the telephone or find some other way to join the gpg strong set

Depends. People could make a hard fork that ignored segwit TX. Or one that ignored transactions with more than 1BTC in them
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:21:01
Sure but you collect fees as a node
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:27:43
Don't cash out: segwit out!
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:21:14
It's nnet. Nnet nnet nnet
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:04:54
Sure. But I'm hoping they will
@_date: 2016-04-13 23:54:12
Can't be because it will be clipped by actual elapsed time 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:46:28
Why do they have bitcoin.com in the poster?
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:42:45
Segwit is already released and in use
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:39:18
Segwit isn't a coinbase payment channel
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:49:39
Yeah then people had an big fight over segwit
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:47:42
When people setup a channel they can give a punishment transaction to a bounty hunter with all the funds in the channel split between the person that setup the channel and the bounty hunter. If the bounty hunter sees someone publish a stale transaction they can publish the punishment transaction and claim the bounty. They basically need to be a full node to perform this job
@_date: 2016-04-14 07:02:13
Estimated time can't be 5 minutes if elapsed time is 10 minutes 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:37:01
What are you on about
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:39:47
The inventive is fees.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:57:31
If clients start to default to bech32 then hopefully coinbase support requests will switch from winging about fees to "why is my address invalid"
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:18:14
Yeah but a large segwit adoption is not required for LN
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:32:05
The devisibility could be increased with a soft fork
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:47:14
Segwit is a requirement for this particular lightning network spec.
Encouraging people to use segwit doesn't help LN adoption at all
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:56:56

So is showering
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:54:18
Nope and even hashing algos that are efficient on CPUs won't be affected because they don't make any syscalls
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:04:53
Channels are not controlled by one entity. And segwit doesn't make it a channel
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:04:26
Well you get to choose what your fees are
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:20:30
You could earn fees as a bounty hunter
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:05:59
Governments (mostly EU) are looking to get rid of or limit cash transactions for this reason
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:11:28
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:31:59
No it's the other way around. More LN means more segwit. More segwit doesn't mean more LN.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:49:10
Even if Trevor was using intel it wouldn't be vulnerable as they don't need to use rings and are single user.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:33:52
No we're talking about how segwit isn't LN or made by coinbase: 
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:21:13
It's not phishing because they're not pretending to be someone else.

@_date: 2017-12-29 00:13:37
Why close it?
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:24:02
I think you mean "job creators"

You can make segwit mando with a softfork
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:46:51

So you're saying iron has no intrinsic value, it just has value because people want it?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:23:05
Yeah they definitely don't need hf
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:18
I think you mean rcoin
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:06:32
It's called bcash. I feel personally insulted when you say "bitcoin cash"
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:23
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:38:22
You can make it mandatory with a softfork
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:40:36
You also have to run a full node or place a bounty for full node operators to collect with
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:05:06
Yeah that's my point
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:13:45
You mean like 1
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:02:24
It's a loan
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:29:20
But what gives those abilities value?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:53:00
More like lightning stream core. Just wait for the bcash version it's going to be 9999% more efficient because I'm a self made millionaire. ����������
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:16:26
No because if you can do something with a softfork instead of a hardfork you should do it with a softfork
@_date: 2018-09-04 17:34:29
Really good reference by all accounts, but not idea what the source is

@_date: 2017-12-05 21:51:14
Yeah you can make things with iron, but what gives those things value?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:23:54
There's a whole wish list of hf changes. See spoonnet
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:13:57
Tbh it will do that too
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:46:56
Are we taking the timestamp on the block? Or when the block is propagated?
@_date: 2018-08-27 19:42:50
You do, if you don't like a PR that goes in (a. you should have spoke up at the BIP phase)  b. You can switch to another client fork
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:13:40
It doesn't rely on it though. It makes it easier to consolidate your dust
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:05:20

@_date: 2018-05-27 10:42:21
The trick is to just not steal the money. Bitcoin is about removing trust where it's not needed, if you don't need something trustless (eg you already know that you're not a thief) you can pick and choose

Mining doesn't get harder as time passes. It gets harder as more people compete
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:08:56
Segwit was a total change of transaction format. We could add precision with a soft fork.
It would effectively be a mandatory drive chain, and you could only move tx back when you'd merged enough outputs.
Why you'd do it though? Just keep it on lightning
@_date: 2018-10-02 08:47:16
You get paid if you run a lightning routing node, or in the future a watchtower

If you take card tx you have to charge the same price as the cheapest other payment method
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:56:44
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:46:50
Merchants can't wriggle out of it using trixy language like card fees are normal but with cash you get a 70p discount
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:39:21
You need to use LN to get cheap fees
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:55:14
I'd rather they got on with supporting the signal protocol
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:45:31
When you send a transaction to someone you sign a declaration saying "anyone with this private key" can now spend these coins.
Then when someone else does a spend they prove they own the private key

Why would people contaminate food with a blockchain?
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:14:20

You won't need this with LN

Running your bitcoin wallet in a Mac is how your get your coins stolen from you by Apple
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:03:18
You could make all new transactions mandatory segwit with a soft fork 
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:37:15
No idea
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:56:26
It had the expected effect
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:54:30
And in fact minors and nodes could make a defacto soft fork by  refusing to include or retransmit transactions that aren't segwit 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:42:58
Memepool will always be full, it's a resource where demand will always outstrip supply. LN will allow you to avoid the memepool for most of your transactions
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:41:40
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:04:15
They use the public key
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:41:47
The payment to drive chain would look like anyone can spend. The payment back would spend one of those anyone can spend tx
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:38:58
UASF has replay protection, because it uses anyone can spend transactions, so on the non segwit fork they you could spend an invalid segwit transaction that would not be spendable on the UASF
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:30:52
Oh good oh
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:55:28
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:58:32
Yeah but nobody is going to stop taking card TX
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:12:07
Could you pad your transaction with random data to match the size of the witness data?
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:43:41
Lightning network users not effected
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:15:12
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:55:40
Replay protection lets you easily choose which leg of a fork to spend transactions on.
S2X is bad because the mechanism that keeps bitcoin blocks at 1MB is the same as the one that keeps it 21 million.
If you can change one with a backroom meeting you can change both
@_date: 2018-10-22 10:21:58
That's illegal in the EU
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:09:15
That limit is pretty high though

There was no HF. Bcash is just an altcoin
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:33:07
Segwit addresses can't send to anything they can only receive. Segwit outputs can be sent to legacy wallets that don't support segwit because they see the segwit transaction as "anyone can spend"
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:51:14
Because segwit blocks it
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:44:48
You need to export the keys and make a new transaction to a new set of keys
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:52:33
It's still totally unrelated
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:43:08
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:57:24
If you have two forks of a bitcoin currency with non equal hashpower you and no replay protection, you can create a transaction with an nLockTime that's current on one branch and in the future of another. Once it's committed on the chain you want you can make a new transaction that's only valid on the other chain
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:51:03
But people could just raise it straight away, it's not like hard/soft/firm forks apply
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:39:03
You're still going to get big fees until you use LN
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:26:21
why not just use a database
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:58:00
That was done with a soft fork, and asking the miners nicely
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:41:29
I'm assuming you mean legacy like legacy software. Bcash and S2X will become legacy software
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:53:51
Repeated power cycles can also break stuff. It's best to purchase a warranty and let a third party spread the risk

You lose the transaction fee of opening a new channel and potentially waiting for when you can unilaterally close the existing channel
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:31:19

They could deploy an update that steals your private keys
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:30:29
Ah no because segwit data is only cryptographically linked to the blockchain /s
I mean that's a good thing really you don't need the signatures after you've validated them so a full node can discard them
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:04:21
No that's ok, because your node will consider the transaction "non-standard" and will ignore it. But dealing with legacy segwit legacy has exactly the same level of security as plain legacy legacy legacy
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:15:38
Well all actions right
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:39:03

No it's not bank notes at all though. Lightning moves bitcoin with real bitcoin transactions:

Because the bar is greasy you can only push it further through the hole, you can't hold onto it to pull it. If one side ever wants to spend it you pay a gold miner to cut your bar in half

For there to be a big enough change to start doing harmful changes it would have to be pushed out to bitcoinj, libbitcoin jsbitcoin etc etc.  It would also likely be a hard forking change

You should probably decide all of your random bits and hash that and display to the client.
Then decide the same number of client random bits and send that to the server.

You can download a copy of the block chain skipping the verification process 
@_date: 2012-02-28 17:21:27
The MultiBit client can be used to generate a bunch of key pairs which you can then export to blockchain.info.
This way you can keep the private keys away from the point of sale so they cannot be stolen.
You can then give out a different pre-generated address to each customer - and go and generate some more when you run out.
When you want to spend boot up MultiBit.

How about this:
 has an errant paragraph:
"The coins are mined in a process conducted all over the Internet, by anyone interested in participating, through a program called the Bitcoin Miner. Centralized inspection ensures that the coins are mined at a pace determined in advance. The principle of mining ensures that the currency will never suffer from inflation. The quantity of coins is limited and supervised by a central agency. An inflexible limit of about 21 million coins has been set, which will be reached around the year 2140."
The following paragraph would be better:
"The coins are mined in a process conducted all over the Internet, by anyone interested in participating, through a program called a Bitcoin Miner. A mathematical proof of work system, with varying difficulty ensures that the coins are mined at a pace determined in advance.  An inflexible limit of about 21 million coins has been set in the software, which will be reached around the year 2140."
But the paragraph indicates that mining is for making the bitcoin, this is only a side aim.  The main reason for mining is to confirm other people's transactions, bitcoin generation is a reward for this confirmation.

What's F&amp;F?
@_date: 2011-11-09 11:25:02
ecdsa is susceptible to quantum computers
@_date: 2017-05-16 10:20:57
Yeah so anyone demanding 2MB + SegWit is wrong 
@_date: 2011-12-04 20:06:48
You can run bitcoin through tor, this way people cannot link your bitcoin addresses by IP.
But you are more likely to link them by spending from multiple outputs spanning addresses.
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:08:07
What makes it unfair? Miners don't have to include cheap transactions if they don't want to
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:15:56
To be fair people do force you to pay extortion fees with bitcoin. (cryptolocker) 
@_date: 2015-03-30 00:51:58
Yes it will
@_date: 2016-10-04 23:11:40
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:56:02
You're right it's not quite legally binding, but it does have some legal weight 
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:35:38
Wikileaks should not reuse addresses
@_date: 2016-05-16 14:45:22
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:16:03
You can't decrypt a hash 
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:43:12
It's illegal to connect to a server without consent. How you get this and wether running an http server is implicit consent is not the law's problem.
Robots.txt has some legal weight 
Edit: updated with facts
@_date: 2015-10-09 22:02:47
It's cased GitHub
@_date: 2011-10-31 20:48:17
And in fact from the software center.
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:27:08
Segwit is 2MB noob
@_date: 2015-10-07 19:24:13
360 millibits?
@_date: 2011-12-14 16:09:23
The web based IRC client is freenode's and the GPG authentication system only requires links to gpg keys/sigs to be pasted so it should work the same as your main client.
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:16:47
In that case you can only use sign or computes an operation on 
@_date: 2016-05-12 18:11:34
The term is decrypt. You use the private key to decrypt input data into nonsense, then anyone else can encrypt that nonsense into the original input data
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:11:53
Please get a certificate from letsencrypt and make all the states in your site routable VIA URL
@_date: 2016-05-12 18:11:48
Hash is completely wrong 
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:33:44
That's not guaranteed
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:17:53
A hash does occur in signature operations but that's only so that the signature can apply to a large amount of data without taking a very long time to compute 
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:10:12
No it's not 
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:49:06
If the POW changes, which would have the most POW?
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:44:53

ECDSA doesn't do encryption/decryption

You don't need to do anything magic to accept bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:52:35
Zero reserve banking?
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:21:18
No, Satoshi and Intel had a special agreement to lock bitcoin to your particular CPU. You can pay Intel a fee to move them to a new CPU.
Seriously though they won't double in your wallet, you'll have to jump through some hoops to separate your funds to both legs of the fork.
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:25:34
Bitcoin needs that mentality to operate, otherwise any group could make a fork and split the value base
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:34:45
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:32:37
Yeah but which chain did they mine it on?
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:26:12
Yeah sortof. Needs to be via a transaction that can't be spent on the other chain
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:00:01
You have no guarantee that anything ever
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:42:31
Nothing, but they're anyone can spend
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:23:05
BIP148 is the UASF. You can't have a UASF hard fork
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:34:55
Yeah I think you've got it, but all the altcoin dirtying of bitcoin has to be done in the same tx
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:32:24
Splitting the value base means no more lambo-land
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:08:19
There is no such thing as a BIP148 hard fork
@_date: 2015-10-30 19:15:22
Is this OMEMO?

Yeah quantum doesn't help for the same reason hashing public keys works
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:21:56
What about LN?

Never move a private key, always make a new key pair and transfer funds to it
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:03:15
Yes but it depends what the fork is on. Eg make a small segwit tx and spend it as anyone can spend and later spend it legit.
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:09:16
This is just how Japanese words/names work
@_date: 2013-04-05 23:06:49
The bitcoin won't get lost. If the transaction isn't in the block chain then it won't have "happened". You can edit your wallet to remove the dud transaction using PyWallet: remember to back up!

RBF won't help someone could manually mine it.
You need to create a transaction that spends an output with 2MB block reward parents
@_date: 2013-02-16 22:35:25
That would be bad because they would know the private key. This way you don't have to trust the vending machine after the TX

There is no reward for verifying the blockchain.  The reward is for spending the computational effort to increase the computational effort that it takes to edit the blockchain

You can force it by sending the transaction ID to a friendly bitcoin miner

The protocol doesn't see a decimal point. There are none

I'm not saying that's how it works, just what I can deduce
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:06:05
That's the client? Is the server available?

I think you completely missed the point there

You should use a new address for each transaction, it ruins your anonymity and the sender's
