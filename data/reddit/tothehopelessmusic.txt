Honest question, is it worth it to invest at this point if you're not putting much into it? I bought $100 at an ATH (19.7), and it's currently sitting at 18.2. 
That's fine, I can deal with the dip, but I'm wondering if it was worth it to invest so little so late? I think that's 0.005 of a single BTC. The return on that, even if it hit $100k wouldn't be as significant as if I put that $100 into LTC or ETH and that went up just a couple thousand.
So unless we're buying whole coins or large percentages of a coin at a time, would it be better for newbs to invest elsewhere for now?
Thanks for any honest answers! I'm new to investing in general, so still trying to figure out how it all works.

Investment in general is gambling, whether it’s in a new tech startup or planting crops on a farm. You’re investing limited resources in the hopes of multiplying, and you have no idea if it will pay off, or if you’ll lose it. I’m leaving for work right now. That’s a gamble as I might show up and find out I’m fired, or the whole place went out of business while I was sleeping. So you just gotta pick what’s worth the risks!
