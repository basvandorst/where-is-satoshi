just know it takes about a week to recieve those funds on Coinbase pro, so the dip may or may not still be there
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:30:39
go with your intuition, but I believe its gonna dip again, and it doesn't hurt to diversify! 
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:40:34
bitcoin is on sale :D omg! 
@_date: 2018-09-10 02:06:18

@_date: 2018-09-04 23:52:36

@_date: 2018-08-11 22:33:56

@_date: 2019-03-27 20:01:23
This statement makes me want to buy more....
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:38:13
are you going to literally hodl til a Mil? or short maybe like .5 btc? and get back in with profits? 
I was wanting to hodl til a mil as well, but im not sure if it will be a stable million, hover in that range, or just drop like the other bull run?
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:38:49
my fear is it not being stable and staying there
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:39:32
uhh are hardware wallets susceptible to this? i usually move my coin once my order gets thru? if so, what are some ways to prevent this? 
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:28:49
what makes you so bullish? i have the same feeling but at the sametime i have a feeling another drop...not sure if i should just buy and say fuck it
@_date: 2019-03-19 04:00:01

@_date: 2019-04-01 00:42:48
The bulls ain't having it
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:58:29
I feel you on this, if I had invested the money I put into school into bitcoin, id be loaded rn :/ but with things like this you don't really know what could happen, but you can always go back to school whenever but with bitcoin I feel like its a once in a lifetime opportunity.

@_date: 2018-04-26 00:26:08
i feel you :(, this was exactly me yesterday D;
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:15:43
I had the same thought process and decided to go ahead with it because these low prices won't always be there. as long as you know you can replace it, I don't see the harm in doing so, and you will make more money in the long run as opposed to waiting and the price possibly getting higher. up to you though chief
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:30:44
im scared hold me
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:48:56
I've been using square lately, and if you can't wait for the 1 week for your money to hit CB Pro, then I recommend buying through square, you get more bitcoin than buying off coinbase.
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:09:27
and does this cost fees as well? 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:42:44
Just ordered my nano s! thanks for the guide! 
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:09:06
let's say I have all my coins on my ledger, is it easy or how long would it take to send it back to an exchange to sell it?
