Further Libel laws in the united States are extremely narrow in their definition. This isnt a case for libel unless its proven that that author knowingly wanted to hurt Satoshi. Its hard to prove a persons intentions

UX/UI though is about brainstorming, wireframing , than photoshop, getting feedback 3 times and then going to photoshop for final MVP. It's expensive and hard to do.

he shouldn't have offered anything should have asked for support . If a PM or a designer does this for 200 dollars other clients will say well you did this for this amount...

You just openly stated you and your employer are committing Federal crimes.

TBH he didn't even really ask for a true spec. Any product manager would say no to this job because 200 dollars is worth like an hour of your time.

Top UI/UX designers get 1000s per hour for top work. That being said standard is like 150 an hour so he is asking for one hour of UI/UX...thats just brainstorming.

I don't think you know libel law in the United States well enough. He needs to proove damage to him and his reputation along with prooving newsweek wanted to damage his reputation and or cause harm to him. Libel suits in the united states are one of the hardest to bring to court due to the scope of the law. (source : I did mock trial in highscool and college and have been in multiple libel trials).

sitting on 120k that's not bad considering your probably not paying any taxes on that or at least minimal if you consider capital gains.

Federal prosecutors have 97% conviction rate-- they don't bring a case to trial unless they know they will win.

Even if someone tookover any actions taken by a 2nd DPR Ulbricht can be charged for as a conspiracy. He would have to take action like reporting the second DPR to LEO in order to be out of** the conspiracy.

Put your self as a in the jury that has no idea what the fuck tor /GPG/ silkroad is and you see all this stuff. Reasonable doubt is out the door he is going to jail for a long time. I also predict this will end with a plea bargin if the DA is willing to do that. Preet may want another war metal so he may not even offer a plea (preet being the DA for the S District of NY).

This is one of the reasons why the lawyers that were hired to file this are laughing their asses off on how much they were paid per hour to work on the complaint.

see my comment regarding this pertains to specific privacy on inviduals buying the bitcoins and not the gov. Not a lawyer, I am just bored waiting for my girlfriend to come home.

1. That is the reason Andreas is not being allowed to testify. They do not want to make it seem like bitcoin on trial.
2. Technically if your bank suspects illegal activity for transactions performed they are suppose to report it. See

Just because you were put in power by a person does not mean you are obliged to agree with that person. The case is randomly assigned a judge and if you have read the testimony it is clear the judge is impartial.

This is just not true. See FDIC regulations, consumer finance oversight committee, and also just general banking laws requiring a minimum amount they need to cover your deposits.

its not. Its your money...see FDIC.

They worry about the fraud related to bitcoin being a liability in cause of fraud.

They probably issue a cashiers cheque anyways which is pretty much legal tender.

See but that is what I pay a bank to do. I want a 3rd party that guarantees my financial safety and has a government organization to backup that claim.
