Wouldn't a trillion-dollar market-cap incentivise miners and infrastructure providers to buy bigger HDD's and get better internet connections?

Evidence shows that:
Set limit to 1MB in 2009, blocks didnt reach that until 2016.
Evidence suggests that:
Set limit to 32MB in 2017, blocks may reach that in 2025? 
@_date: 2017-02-03 06:50:52
This implies current 1mb blocks are "filled up with data", which they are not - they are composed almost entirely of non-dust BTC remittances.
@_date: 2017-02-03 06:52:44
When Bitcoin Core changed limit to 1MB, did the subsequent blocks immediately increase to 1MB?

Your "normal operation" assumes honesty from miners &amp; nodes. This appears to me to be a significant attack vector. If an attacker wanted to double-spend, they could easily DDoS the small number of bridge nodes, blacklist segwit nodes, spoof segwit-enabled handshakes, surround exchange with the non-segwit network-fork,  deposit/trade BTC before reorg happens.  
There is nothing in Bitcoin Core now to protect from that.

I wrote blockchainsql.io, a full Bitcoin node. I know how it works at the raw byte level. 0-confirmation transactions, with a malleability fix, is FASTER than LN and secure enough for everyday transactions. 
Instead of improving 0-conf to make them more secure, Blockstream Core offer a convoluted LN that requires the SegWit codehorror to run properly. Why not just improve 0-conf? No ROI for investors, maybe?
No moral person can allow Blockstream Core to continue controlling Bitcoin. Bitcoin was meant for the masses and 0-conf, made more secure, can easily achieve that. These guys have like 60 million in investment, of course they have a PERVERSE INCENTIVE to stifle/cripple Bitcoin in order for their solution to have a use case. The sad truth is that Bitcoin does not need the LN as 0-conf, made secure, solves that.

If Bitcoin Core does not automatically bridge segwit and non-segwit network forks, and relies on minority of "special" nodes to perform that bridge then this seems to open a significant attack vector. Simply attacking the bridge nodes will sever the link between the network forks, and that would quickly lead to a disaster:
- double-spends for example since 1-5 conf transactions could be rolled back.
- timejacking-like attacks where you surround exchange with non-segwit nodes and deposit/trade BTC before re-org happens.
 
That's the difference between testnet's and mainnet's, you get attackers on the latter.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:15:14
This is not the case. Segwit nodes will not communicate with non-segwit nodes. Over time, this leads to a literal forking of the network-topology into two groups.

I have, an exchange has no way of knowing which network fork it's connected to - segwit or non-segwit EXCEPT with handshake information, which is trivial to falsify. 
If you think no one will try clever ways to exploit SegWit, I'd say you should research the extremely complicated attacks other coins have actually (not theoretically) sustained. 
As I said, there is nothing in Bitcoin Core to assure a segwit node that it knows it's talking to another segwit node except for an easily falsifiable handshake.

Correct. Segregated Witness will allow a new market to emerge, "Raw UTXOs" vs "Segwit UTXOs". The "Raw UTXOs" will be valued more because infrastructure providers have not re-invested to re-factor their existing code-infrastructure fully (only partially, to accept funds). As a result, they will still need those  "Raw UTXOs" to fund their programmatic transactions.
I imagine that's why Testnet's non-segwit UTXO's were more valued than the segwit-UTXOs.
**REASON**: Segwit requires 100% of a providers existing infrastructure to be upgraded, in order to participate fairly.
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:11:10
No :-). You'd need to run your own for that (commercially available).
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:07:42
1. Only SELECT :-)
2. Yes, realtime update.
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:48:49
Right, I only found it by querying for large fee transactions. Didn't even know about this.
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:26:15
What's odd about it? Run the sql, now 46478.20597603.
@_date: 2016-06-28 12:23:32
The queries run in a CTE, so just do 
select count(*) as Result from Block
You can use "Load Template" to load query templates.

Thanks. It took a while and was a learning exercise for me, parsing bitcoin at the raw byte level. I hope to provide this service free of charge for good. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 11:13:16
You can query the bitcoin blockchain in sql using 
This query tells you the size of the latest blocks

You're right, this transaction was the source of excessive fee
Has Output 0.0001 and Fee of 291.2409.
Looks like someone mistook the fee field for the payment field.
At USD 465 per BTC, that's 135k :-/
I guess that's the sound of a scream in an empty woods.

Sorry, had some load problems. Am tuning server slowly, it should be better now.
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:03:26
So it's 10 rows per page but you can scroll as page as much as you want (try using it).
Web version has no limitations and is 100% and will remain that way.
The 10 rows per page is a cosmetic feature.
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:08:16
Nice. You can save your query too, and share your unique URL.
Will update hash column as link for explorer, good idea.
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:20:05
Thanks for the tip.

In future, I'll provide a table for USD/BTC price that you can join too. 291 BTC wasn't worth much once :-)

Because "Index" is a reserved word in SQL Server, you just wrap it in square parenthesis [ ].
Check out templates for guides on common queries.

Know nothing about 21.co, will check it out.

No one has seriously thought about attacking SegWit, since there is no profit in testnet coins.
Forking the network-topology and relying on a handful of "bridge nodes" opens up significant new attack vectors that no one has properly investigated. If segnet is getting reorgs of up to 5-10 confirmations, that's DAO-scale disaster territory on mainnet.
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:10:21
It's big and depends on the DBMS you choose. If you trim out script data, it's 4 - 5 x the Bitcoin Core's blockchain. If you have all the data, it's 10 x (500+ GB right now).
I sell the server product for people and organisations who want their own version of this.

Expecting an unbanked member of the 3rd world to pay a fee of 20c just to buy an item that costs 10c, is not "better than the banks".
@_date: 2016-11-24 08:00:47
Use Ethereum.
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:55:15
Reliably like now? 48hours for a confirmation is not "reliable". Expecting an indian to pay 20c fee for a purchase in India is not "reliable".
@_date: 2016-11-23 03:54:56
Segwit does not have the support to activate. 10% actively opposes it, and it's growing.
Bitcoin will need to HF in order to survive.
