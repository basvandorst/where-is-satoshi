No, I wouldn't every type a seed into a website, or anything with an internet connection for that matter. This is a super paranoid approach but I tend to think it is better to be paranoid with cryptos. I use hardware wallets that use 24 word seeds. I encourage you to look for an offline solution to your problem. There are offline wallets that have wallet recovery options. I'm certainly no expert but you'll need to find a wallet recovery tool that is compatible with the encryption protocol that was used to generate your wallet with your seed.

The war on drugs is not a blanket term for all forms of drug deterrence

You can mine bitcoin without spending much, however you will likely lose money as the cost of buying and running a cheap rig generally offsets any bitcoin mined. If you decide to go down this route I recommend you join a pool. In any case I highly recommend you spend a lot of time researching bitcoin. I don't mean to sound condescending but the nature of the question indicates relatively low understanding.

Being against the war on drugs doesn't necessarily mean you support criminal activity

Thanks for reply. My general assumption (with absolutely no basis mind you) is that most new money is slippery, especially when there has been significant media attention. I hope you're right though!

You don't need to trade the physical asset... When people trade gold in commodity markets they generally never see the gold unless they are a producer or a consumer of gold.

The difference between a hard-fork and a soft-fork is that a soft-fork is backwards compatible whereas a hard-fork is not. This means that in the event of a hard fork, legacy blocks are incompatible with the updated network. Both the legacy and updated blockchains will exist concurrently, but the respective blockchains follow different rules. 
Edit: added last sentence.

It's probably a 12 word seed. I have only used 24 word seeds so I am not going to be able to help you. However it is important that you are careful with the advice you take, this kind of post is bait for a phishing/social engineering attack.
