Yea, this is actually not that irresponsible at all. Chances of Bitcoin going down below $3000 in the next 2.5 years is very low, so it's not like you would even lose everything. The evidence suggests that it will actually be worth way more when you return. Kudos.

Money hardness has a specific definition. While it is true that gold is still currently harder than bitcoin, with a S/F if 55, bitcoin will soon surpass gold in that respect and it’s S/F ratio will continue to increase into the 100s, 200s, etc.

Fair point, I agree it is definitely worthwhile to discuss.
To address your observation of the disjointed feature of this model I provided commentary in the discussion section of the paper. But, basically, that disjointed feature is only present AFTER Bitcoin has become the most valued asset on the planet (I.e. it’s market cap surpasses one or several of those M money supply measures). Therefore, the correct interpretation of that disjointedness is NOT that the price of Bitcoin jumps up in a single day. Rather, the correct interpretation is that the exchange rate of BTC/USD is reduced as a result of the halving, and because there is a flood of fiat currency that is overwhelming the supply of newly minted bitcoins. That’s why the “price” of bitcoin eventually hugs up against the upper bound—it’s not the price of Bitcoin that is magically increasing, it’s the value of fiat that is rapidly reduced because everybody knows that fiat is worthless compared to Bitcoin and the whole planet is desperately trying to get some satoshis. To view that phenomenon as an increase in price is like driving on the same side of the road on which you drove yesterday even though everybody else collectively decided to switch sides! If you don’t make the switch to the new way of understanding, you’re gonna get hit!
To address your other points... not two boom bust cycles, I think I counted three.
And yes, the narrow halving window is going to be quite narrow in May 2020, but it will be very very very narrow on the 4th halving. This model predicts it will go through that narrow halving window, so we’ll know how correct this model is soon enough.

Yes. Real estate is an interesting variable. Homeowners don't really need to fear as much about losing much of their relative net worth because a house is a good in and of itself, unlike fiat dollars or bitcoins, which are temporary media used to exchange for real goods (like a home). So, when the world transitions over to using bitcoins, their house will simply switch from being priced in fiat, to being priced in bitcoins.
On the other hand, the S/F ratio of bitcoin is going to continually increase until 2140. So, many people might find that the strategy that is best for them would be to sell their homes early when they can get a relatively large number of bitcoins, and then rent while the relative value of their bitcoins increases as the S/F ratio increases.

The pattern of convergence to which I refer in that article is specifically that which remains within the exponential decay curves that have been fit to the data, I.e. if the price breaks out of those curves then the pattern is broken. That’s not to say that the price couldn’t then go back toward the model, it’s just that it would not be strictly converging as it has been in the past.
That range that I refer to, about 14k to 20k, is specifically for the date of the May 2020 halving. I’m not saying that it has to stay in that range after the halving. It really is quite self explanatory if you just look at the picture with the circles. If it’s gonna stay within those lines then it has to stay within those lines!

Yea well, S/F fluctuates a lot because the timing of block arrivals to the blockchain is a Poisson process. If you just use an average of 10 minutes per block then it’s about $6000. Source: I’m the one who first showed the convergence toward the S/F model.

Yes, that’s correct, S/F is always the midpoint between the upper and lower bounds. But, due to the stepwise nature of the S/F over time, in order for the market value to continue converging in the following subsidy era, during which the S/F model implies price is much greater, the bitcoin market value must increase away from the current model implied price.... like it’s reaching for the next step on the ladder, and the only way to do that is to pull away from the current step *before* the halving. And if it continues to converge, then the precision with which this move is made becomes greater and greater at each halving.

IMO, the likelihood of Bitcoinization is infinitely more than the likelihood of the Christian Rapture..... cuz, ya know, there's actually evidence and reasoning that suggests Bitcoinization. So, really, the two are incomparable.
A better analogy would be giving actually useful protection from extreme global warming. There are many many people who doubt that global warming is due to human action--despite the claims provided by experts--but if you could provide tangible security to your family members that would protect them from the effects of extreme global warming, would that be a bad gift to give? I think giving somebody 0.02 BTC actually does provide quite a bit of security in the event of hyperbitcoinization.

my concern was about the extreme scenario: a geomagnetic storm that lasted more than 24 hours, and strong enough to affect the data stored on hard disks. In that scenario, if there are no hard disks that are protected, then most of the blockchain data could be affected over the course of 24 hours.
@_date: 2019-11-24 15:49:39
It means this is how the price action looks in relation to the S/F model. S/F model is y-axis level 1.0. S/F model implied price is about $6000, so points around a multiple of 1.0 (which is what we saw the last two cycles) correspond with prices around $6000.

forget the thick blue lines, that's for answering a different question. To answer your question, the thin blue line that is in the middle of the bounds, that's the price implied by the S/F model. On the day of the halving, that implied price will jump from about $6000 to about $68000, *without stopping at some price in between*. One minute the implied price is $6000, the next minute its $68000. The NHW is about $10000 to $30000, and the implied price by the model *never* falls in that range.
@_date: 2019-11-05 04:22:16
@_date: 2019-11-04 22:15:31
Depends which measure of money supply we're talking about. There's M0, M1, M2 and M3.  
Why does the S/F model *have* to break down? If the value of Bitcoin comes from it's hardness as a monetary good, and S/F is a measure of that hardness, and *we are already converging toward the S/F model*, it seems only natural that the stock-to-flow model will continue to be accurate.
Unless by, "break down" you mean that it becomes a moot point as the entire planet switches from fiat to Bitcoin. That's the whole point. When the whole planet switches over, it won't matter if one bitcoin is worth 10 billion USD because people won't be measuring value using USD, they'll be measuring value using bitcoins. So trying to "model" the price of bitcoins will be like trying to "model" the price of US dollars. What's the price of one dollar? 1. What's the price of one bitcoin? 1.

Yes, that was my interpretation as well. But I also see it as something like increasing market efficiency. I really think the value of Bitcoin is its hardness as money (because it is pure money), so the convergence to S/F model is just price discovery by an ever increasingly efficient market.
The ultimate test of this theory of mine will be on all the halvings after the 3rd. The 4th and 5th halvings have "narrow halving windows" that are extremely narrow. To see the value of Bitcoin increase (or the value of fiat decrease) so much on the day of the halving would be such a wake up call to everybody who doesn't already own bitcoin.... just amazing.

Good questions, thanks for asking.
You are correct that the NHW is within the upper and lower bounds. However, those upper and lower bounds were introduced by me in this paper. They were not part of the original S/F model presented by Plan B. I use the word divergent simply to mean that the price is trending away from the price implied by the S/F model. In Figure 2, the price is seen to oscillate around the S/F model. So, when the price is below the model and trending up, it is moving closer to the model. But, when the price is *above* the model and also trending up, then it is moving away (or diverging) from the model.
If the price on the halving in May is significantly outside the NHW then that would not be enough to conclude that the S/F model is not applicable, it would only be enough to conclude that the value of bitcoin is not *converging* toward the S/F model (at least, not within the bounds shown in Figure 2). It could be the case that the price is simply trending with the S/F model, like it is generally parallel with it, but does not gradually get closer to it. But that is not how it appears in Figure 2 of my paper.

yea... but you gotta know what the stock-to-flow model is. It's a specific mathematical relationship discovered by Plan B.
I just took it one step further, and showed that the price is not merely linearly correlated according to the S/F model, the price is \*converging\* to the S/F model.
The point of this post is to show that this dip actually happened in previous cycles if you look at it this way.

Yes, that's good. And that would actually show up in this model as an anomaly, which would suggest that the model is no longer correlating as it used to.
so, a lower low this year would basically be 3k, right? That corresponds with a model multiple of about 0.5. This close to the halving, that would be historically unprecedented based on this chart.
So, yes, a good way to test the health of bitcoin.

Well that's easy. If society chooses to spend more of their play-time in virtual reality, and society starts to spend more hours in virtual reality each week as automation begins to take care of our daily needs, then we're moving more towards a world like that depicted in Ready Player One. Reality and Virtual Reality will begin to merge from the viewpoint of humans, so it only seems natural that Bitcoin would serve as the currency in all virtual reality spaces. That's because Bitcoin is both tangible and virtual. It has tangibility in Reality, but it exists virtually. If we wish to make it difficult to cheat in virtual reality (like generate $1000000000000 units of virtual currency with a cheat code), then something that is tangibly limited seems like a suitable currency in virtual reality.  
So, incorporate Bitcoin as a currency in your applications.

Could be. How many 380k predictions are there? If this is the one you're thinking of, then it's not actually predicting 380k in the next halving cycle. That would only happen if the peak occurs at a time when the S/F ratio is above its average value. But, due to the statistical nature of the block mining, the daily S/F ratio is very noisy, so if the peak is bounded by that S/F ratio and it's fluctuating around its average value then the price will likely only hit ~$130k to $200k.

This really gets to the issue of the *granularity* (or, resolution) of the data, i.e. daily data vs weekly data vs minute-by-minute data. Technically, in the way that I described it in the paper, the S/F ratio is basically a step-wise function around the halving. What that means is the daily implied price of Bitcoin by the S/F model, around say for example this upcoming halving, would be like $5985, $6021, $6049, *$68,207, $68,283, etc.* The price implied by the S/F model is never some value inside the NHW (except for the first one).

No! You did not read the picture correctly! The blue lines are approximately the limits based on the randomness in the boundary. The average is the grey line. Look again! Also, it is not a rule that the price is one half of the upper boundary, it’s simply less than that because of the randomness of the true S/F ratio. That randomness will probably be about the same as it has been previously.

Also, this model is based on the fundamental reality. Just ask yourself, why is Bitcoin so important, so special? Is it because it can be massively inflated, even 100 years from now? Or is it because it is Hard Money, unable to be inflated by human intervention, scarce? Which one is it?
This model is built on that foundation, and it is focused on that foundation, because it is one that acknowledges that the true value of bitcoin is proportional to S/F. *Converging* to the S/F model is simply increasing market efficiency, as the market becomes better and better at discovering the true value of bitcoin! The true value is the hardness!

What you’ve written isn’t wrong, but the “hardness” to which I refer has a specific definition, as I wrote in the paper. The hardness is measured by S/F ratio, which will soar well above 100 while gold will remain around 55. Therefore, Bitcoin will by far be the hardest money according to that technical definition of *hardness*.
@_date: 2019-11-10 19:31:30
What Peter Schiff doesn’t understand us that value is subjective, and objective value is discovered by the free market. So, while many people like you and me don’t really value gold all that much, it does objectively have value because the price that emerges from millions of market participants is about $1500 USD. And yet it seems Peter doesn’t acknowledge the same is true for Bitcoin.

I think Visser94 is not totally wrong. What you're suggesting is that value be measured in 2010 USD terms (effectively, "hey, you gotta include inflation"). But it makes sense to use only one measure of value, so the meme should also express the value of 2019 Bitcoins in 2010 dollars. However, given the crazy volatility of BTC/USD, the $7700 value could just as easily estimate the value of bitcoins with inflation as without.
But, there's no reason why you can't use present value US as a measure of value... it's just a measure that is time dependent. Either way is equally valid.

Using average block time of 10 minutes, upper bound is $34k, lower bound is about $850. But the lower bound on the day of the halving jumps up to $10k, so if it continues to converge then it really can’t go anywhere near the $850 lower bound, it has to go up in order to be greater than the new lower bound after the halving, $10k.

@_date: 2019-11-05 02:33:05
Yes, exactly. To be more precise, it's only the lower end of the NHW that is increasing. the upper end of the NHW is, by definition, on the upper boundary.
The NHW is kinda like a portal to leads into the next subsidy era, which is why the data points in figure 4 are disconnected at each halving; the points go from somewhere around a multiple of 1, in the middle, and then at the moment of the halving they are transported down to the lower bound. That's because the S/F ratio suddenly increased as a result of the halving, but the price on the day after the halving is basically the same as it was on the day before, so it got downgraded to a low multiple.

Well, in this particular instance, I think Peter's clinging to gold might very well be due to his age (and the fact that he owns a precious metals dealer). It seems like it is so obvious to millenials and gen Z that there is nooooo way society could go back to using physical gold, so that only leaves digital transacting of the rights to gold, where the gold is centrally held. But that entirely misses the need for decentralization and individual sovereignty, and I think this is the part that Peter misses. He is old, and I think it's precisely his age that he doesn't think decentralization and individual sovereignty is critical. Either that, or his age is preventing him from understanding the exact mechanisms of Bitcoin that make the technology possible.
@_date: 2019-11-10 19:27:26
If you are familiar with Peter Schiff and his position regarding Bitcoin then you would know that “ok boomer” is really the only appropriate response at this point. He has debated about Bitcoin many times in the past and it seems he still doesn’t get it. If a person spends that much time refusing to acknowledge the value of Bitcoin, then it is not due to a lack of argumentation! It’s due to his understanding and his perspective as a boomer.
So, no, I will say okay boomer whenever it is appropriate.

This article is just plain wrong. Price implied by S/F model is about $6000 right now.
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:10:52
Also, because the model is a linear fit to the daily data, the linear fit will technically adjust by a very very very small amount as new data is added. So, the price could be just outside the NHW as it is presented in this paper, but still inside the true NHW because the model has adjusted ever so slightly. But, generally, it looks like the midpoint of the NHW in May 2020 is about 18k. If it is well below 10k, or well above 30k, then the value of bitcoin is probably not strictly converging toward the model and this paper is false.

I’m not sure how the model will work, but I *highly* doubt that action from the central banks. If the CBs start withdrawing funds, it has to be from the reserves of other banks. Given the massively increased repo operations that they’ve been doing recently, it seems the big banks are already in something of a liquidity crisis. Withdrawing funds would only exacerbate that problem, and many banks would likely fail. No way they’re gonna let that happen.

it's fine. The upper bound is not defined by the S/F price at T-1. The *narrow halving window* is defined as the range of prices between the upper bound on T-1 and the lower bound on T+1. The upper bound and lower bound are merely an exponentially decaying multiple of the S/F model. They are the same bounding lines in Figure 2, that converge toward a multiple of 1.0.

I don't have time to write a lot, so I'll just write this: you are putting the cart before the horse. The superficial details and semantics do not come before the people and their values, the people and their values come before the details. You should read the book "7 habits of highly effective people". One of the habits is "put first things first." Clearly you didn't put people first, so allow me to explain:
If the people want to accumulate bitcoins, and they want to use Bitcoin to transact, then that is what they will do. Period. End of discussion.
Wasn't that easy?
FYI, your 2nd and 3rd bullet points are increasingly moot as Bitcoin is increasingly adopted. To paraphrase your own argument e.g. a 0.005 BTC item might be, say, $5000 USD, and 5 seconds later cost $5100. See how much frustration there is from using fiat? Such a bad experience.

The picture is a screen capture of a moment in the film “The Big Short.” The quote is said by the person in the picture. The actual quote is “It’s happening. Everybody wants our swaps.” The “swaps” are credit default swaps that a small number of investors purchased before the ‘08 financial crisis as a bet against the housing market.
It’s scary because a shift in global sentiment regarding the housing market is small compared to a flip in global sentiment regarding money. The financial crisis caused millions of people to lose their homes, their jobs, their retirement funds, etc. A global flip from fiat money to sound, digital money will likely make the financial crisis seem like a momentary strong gust of wind compared to the hurricane that will ensue as people become desperate for bitcoins.

FYI, I actually don't disagree with you, I am quite diversified myself. But, I think his point is still true, and I think his point was simply this: if you lack the information that is required to make a surely profitable trade, then diversify. Generally, middle-class Joe Shmoe is an idiot (he lacks the information that is required to make a surely profitable trade).
I think putting one's money in SPY is not a surely profitable trade. As I once explained to my brother: doing a ton of research on any particular company is a waste of time because if the national economy shifts or declines then things like the PE ratio, debt to capital, gross margin, relative strength index, etc. etc. don't matter because the economy doesn't care, it just does what it does and if the economy goes off a cliff then almost all stocks are going down. Doing a ton of research on the national economy is a waste of time too because if the international economy shifts or declines then unemployment rate, ISM manufacturing index, treasury yield curve, etc. etc. etc. don't matter because the international economy doesn't care, it just does what it does and if countries decide they want a different reserve currency then the purchasing power of the US dollar can rapidly decline, so if your SPY return is +5% but the dollar lost 10% PP then your trade was not profitable in terms of PP.
And doing a ton of research on all national economies is a waste of time too, because if somebody invents Bitcoin then all fiat currencies are fucked.
Oh wait.... somebody already invented Bitcoin. Well, now we don't lack the information that is required to make a surely profitable trade!!!!! Happy Happy!!!

If cryptocurrencies in general are the future then I think the people who criticize and doubt the future of crypto--specifically because cryptocurrencies are NOT scarce--are correct. If we don't have one (or few) cryptocurrency that becomes the dominant currency then crypto isn't really all that much better than fiat... there is truly no limit to the number of cryptocurrencies that can be created.

The monetary revolution hasn’t happened yet because the general population still values fiat currency more highly than it does crypto. One big reason for that is the limited transaction bandwidth of the main blockchain. Lightning network hopes to speed things up a lot so it is usable by the general population.
But still, it won’t happen until the general population values crypto more highly than it does fiat (this is kind of tautological, but w/e). This will happen when the market value of all crypto surpasses global broad money supply (10s to 100s of trillions USD). If stock-to-flow model continues to be accurate then this will happen in 8-13 years.

I think categorizing "The Government" as a single entity is a misrepresentation. For sure, there will be people and institutions who will be motivated to suppress the popularity and market value of Bitcoin. However, I'm sure there are some honest people in government who would actually welcome and encourage the adoption of Bitcoin.  
The organizations who would be most motivated to suppress Bitcoin would probably be the parts of government that are most wedded to the federal reserve and banking system, such as, it seems, the treasury.

I think your assessment of future events is a little too dramatic to be realistic. It's realistic for an asteroid-collides-with-Earth kind of Armageddon, or WWIII Armageddon... but what we're describing with Bitcoin is just humans going about their usual day with only one significant difference: a preference for sound money in the form of Bitcoin over unsound fiat money. That would be the only significant difference. Government officials wouldn't cause chaos and havoc and shut down a major form of communication just because the people change their preference.  
Again, "The Government" is not a single entity, it is a large group of people. Sure, the election process may be corrupt and not entirely democratic... but that doesn't change the fact that the government is a collection of people who have the same incentives and motivations as regular citizens. The US government won't just switch to a dictatorship overnight... there will still be a congress, there will still be voting, there will still be checks and balances, and that will all happen among people with different opinions of Bitcoin. Some government officials will prefer the switch to Bitcoin.

Well, that's an example of what I wrote in my reply to u/dietrolldietroll :  






this is something that interests me... I think this could largely explain the bull markets that have come after the halvings: If miners preferentially HODL their subsidies then the halving does not merely cut supply of new coins in half. Technically it cuts it in half, but then the effect is that miners hold on to their subsidies more than before the halving, so the supply is reduced by more than 50%.

Something that I suspect is that the mining industry has become competitive, and due to the competition the hash rate has increased, difficulty has increased, which means more equipment is required to maintain bitcoin subsidy revenue.
If the industry is saturated then I imagine their profit margin is very small, which would imply that they are selling the bulk of their product (bitcoins). So, I'm curious to know about their own trading behavior: do they actually sell *all* of their product, and not merely the bulk, or do they hold as much as possible during bull markets? Do they build up a reserve of fiat so that they can hold the bitcoins during bull market and use the fiat reserve to pay the electricity bill?
I'm curious.

Satoshi Nakamoto is not a made up name. The name is real. There are people with the name Satoshi and the name Nakamoto. It’s the identity of the Bitcoin creator that we don’t know, and we don’t know if Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym or not. Probably is a pseudonym. But the name isn’t made up.
Gafelpoodinpoop is a made up name.

The open market operations to which this quote refers are the actions that many people complain about regarding the Fed.
