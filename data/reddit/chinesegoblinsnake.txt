Nicely done.

Where did you guys get this Linden Dollar thing? Independent said Bitcoin, her tweet said Bitcoin...

I don't see any on the front page right now. Maybe we see different? Anyway, no need to have this conversation. People will be people!

K then...

Man, you guys are nuts. I mentioned how I see things and what I'm doing without taking sides and you come up with all this nonsense, telling me how I should and shouldn't see things and what I should and shouldn't be doing, speaking at me like I'm some kind of enemy.

Enemies of Bitcoin? I love Bitcoin, ya feckin' oblong!

I can understand that. That'd put me right off. That's a bit like what I've experienced here today in response to my comments from a few people. You can see it for yourself, but, still, no one side has won me over. I don't give a shit about their personal politics. I'm in this for me, and perpetuation of decentralised, peer-to-peer technology. Nobody's opinions will steer me away from that.

Well, it's not a significant percentage of my crypto holdings anyway. If you don't like it, see no possible use for it, then you don't hold it, simple.

To you too!

Well, I must have missed those posts. Haven't been there long, but haven't seen as much hoping BTC fails there as I've seen people talking all kinds of rubbish about BCH here. Not saying it's not there, just that I haven't seen so much of it.

Like I've said, I haven't been there long, and what I did see didn't feel like some sort of smear campaign against anyone or any currency. I probably have a skewed, narrow perspective on this since I haven't looked too much into it, but what little I did see didn't feel like someone was trying to run a game on me. If it did, or if they were, I probably wouldn't be speaking as I am. All I know is that, since I spent some time looking around, I feel better hedging my bets rather than taking sides.

I do mean 0.25 BTC to 0.25 BCH.
I'm not one for guessing what will happen and, seeing as I don't -know-, I won't half-ass it with a bunch of opinions. I'm into possibilities in this case. We'll see what happens!
