Front-running and shadowing are unethical. Employees of an exchange trading on other exchanges is dangerous. You want them trading on their employer's exchange so they can be monitored. And so they eat their own dog food, but mostly for compliance.

I'm trying to find where Zane said user information may have been or was compromised. Other than the phishing post, I can't find anything even hinting at it. Can you point me in the right direction? Thanks!
Edited to add: not that I don't think NPI was at least at risk. It's just I don't know he can issue a blanket no until they really do know one way or the other, so we can't necessarily infer anything from its lack.

You seemed optimistic about this yesterday, but does this mean you're confident? positive? the attacker did not have system access to verification or bank account data?
That might be worth putting in the FAQ. 
Having your bank account raided and/or a few months of identity theft after losing your BTC would be, uh, unpleasant.

I've been trying to think through what might happen with ETH/C, but I don't know close to enough to have a feel for it.
My naive view is that if miners see enough activity in ETC, they'll allocate some mining power there, either by switching or adding new resources dedicated to ETC.
If that's right, wouldn't the logical outcome be a 50-50 ETH-ETC split of mining power? Or maybe a ratio equal to that of their respective market caps?
Miners will mine where it's most valuable. If ETC's price and activity goes up, miners will mine it over ETH. But if they all went to ETC, then ETH would be more profitable because there'd be less mining competition.
So... am I even close to right? Is it reasonable to think we end up with an even and roughly stable split between ETH and ETC? What would that mean for users of ETH/C. Could the same happen to Bitcoin?

Thx.

What about information assets in your system - customer verification data and images, bank account numbers for wire templates, that sort of thing. Did the attacker have access to that as well? Any evidence of copying off your network?

What do consider the better/best wallets for various occasions? Not trying to find fault - I'm totally new to this so don't have a feel for contexts beyond offline storage, I need a wallet to spend/receive now and again, and whatever I'm keeping on an exchange (which I'd rather keep somewhere I control).

Thanks for the summary. It's certainly well beyond what I'd likely need for the foreseeable future. I'd also probably feel like I was always on the edge of losing track of something, although maybe how you're using Electrum mitigates some of that. It's certainly been interesting learning about this stuf....

Does this update also enable the Ledger Nano S, or will that come later (like after they actually start shipping)?
