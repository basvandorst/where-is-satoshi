That’s ultra conservative. We were at 13.8k recently. The halving hysteria will start to kick in more and more. I think we reach 20k by January at least
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:42:53
Do you have to claim bitcoin on your taxes?
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:34:58
So more 2020 then 19. I feel like the halving fomo could kick in at the end of this year which is going to make the price skyrocket. What’s your year end prediction?
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:33:13
What do you think the price will be at the end of 2019?
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:15:06
What’s everyone’s short term predictions? Ok talking less than 12 months
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:12:35
Hahahaha are you trolling
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:30:12
Is the halving bull run still on, just later like in early 2020?
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:59:01
Thanks. But if you just buy and hodl you dont have to worry about taxes until you sell it?
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:22:27
Ok. I was just curious as to the thought that went into your comment. That’s all
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:26:01
Other than BTC, is real estate the best investment at this time?
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:20:25
Hahahaha I just thought so bc the nature of this page. What is your reasoning?
@_date: 2019-06-10 20:53:03
Define somewhat near future, we talking within a year?
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:48:19
You think it’s done being under 8k father foreseeable future?
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:51:55
Thanks. And do you recommend storing bitcoin in a separate online wallet versus storing on the website?
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:35:25
That’s the goal. I’m only 22 and trying to get into it. I have a decent amount of money saved up that I’ve been investing in mutual funds. I figure when I’m this young I might as well be risky and pick something more violatile such as bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:41:43
If the 2FA is working, should it ask me to do the Authentication and text verification to log in? I think I successfully added 2FA but when I login I just type in my username and password it logs me in so I’m not sure if it worked or not
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:57:33
I didn’t make any transactions yet so maybe that’s it. I only logged in
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:36:21
How long do you think it is safe for? I know everyone recomends the Ledger or Trezor but I wanna buy BTC while waiting to get one
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:14:44
What type of wallet does everyone use? If people can give me a rundown of there’s, that would be great. In new to this
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:32:30
Is it safe to keep a small amount of Bitcoin on coinbase for only a week or so until I get a Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:37:46
Thanks. Is the Nano S and Treznor both easy to use and user friendly?
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:51:24
Sorry I am rookie. What exactly is a 2fa?
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:59:22
I did. Does it only test the two 2 verification when you make transactions or log in in general?
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:52:45
Is that saying if you keep your BTC on coinbase you dont really own the BTC since it is on their website and not on your own personal harddrive?
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:03:24
When will the buying window close? Should you buy all way up to early 2020 right before the halving when the price is nearing 50k?
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:20:23
But even though it’s price has gone way up since January is it still a good buy at 8.5k?
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:55:35
Thanks. So in your opinion if I do this a Ledger is not necessary?
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:58:19
If you lose it are there plenty of backup things you can do to keep your bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:40:05
Sorry to keep asking dumb questions hahahaha but what’s the best way to get me of those
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:15:40
Is coinbase trustworthy?
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:41:50
of course. I think the bull market is already starting to set in so im trying to buy ASAP
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:43:41
Im a rookie. Do you mind explaining what open source means?
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:49:25
What’s the best place to buy bitcoin? Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:46:02
And what will the ledger do?
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:19:25
It seems like the pros for the hard wallets are there are no fees (I think) and even more safe. Cons are difficult to manage (I assume) and then what if you lose it?
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:41:16
Maybe about 2 weeks, perhaps a little longer. I like the hot wallet idea but I heard the fees are pricey
@_date: 2019-05-30 00:54:37
Does it connect to every mac? Or are there compatibility issues bc I know the MacBook Air doesn’t have as many drives
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:59:42
Thank you for the advice. It seems like even if you keep BTC on Coinbase the chances of getting hacked are minuscule (if you are smart),  but the ledger gives people the peace of mind knowing they will not get hacked
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:48:18
Interesting. I keep hearing its dangerous to get BTC stored on coinbase
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:39:30
So does Ledger S count? And by software does a wallet on coinbase count?
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:37:20
Thanks. At first i was hesistant to spend the money but everyone says its worth it. Makes sense especially if you are buying multiple full bitcoins
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:17:48
The code for the Trezor?
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:46:46
Where can I uncheck that?
@_date: 2019-05-30 05:36:29
Thanks. I appreciate all the advice to everyone here. Im new to this and not that smart to begin with hahahaha but crypto-currency is something I really want to get into bc Im sick of getting 6% ROI on boring mutual funds
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:27:32
Coinbase question:
If the 2FA is working, should it ask me to do the Authentication and text verification to log in? I think I successfully added 2FA but when I login I just type in my username and password it logs me in so I’m not sure if it worked or not
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:56:26
Makes sense. Its only truly safe if it is your possession
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:16:36
Thanks. Im working on getting a Ledger bc I plan on trading large amounts of money but for now I feel safe on coinbase with smaller quanitities
