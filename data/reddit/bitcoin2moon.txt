For starters,U dont need to learn the underlying blockchain tech, as u dont need to learn how the Fed work. U just need a bitcoin wallet and get some bitcoin to do some transactions.

Let me say this: it's ur hard earned money therefore u should do ur own due diligence on which one to invest. In the end its a zero sum game where one coon will come on top because of the vast majority of network support from users, merchants, etc. and I strongly believe is decentralized bitcoin.
