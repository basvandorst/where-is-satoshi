He's joking.

You really didn't think this through.

That's a great argument.

Property rights exist to protect value, which is derived from scarcity. 
You couldn't sue me for breathing too much of your air, absorbing too much of your sunlight, etc.

Yeah, I'm with you on most of that stuff. You've still failed to prove how someone explicitly owns intellectual property. 
You do have a moral right to what you produce, the product of your labor, etc. That still clearly doesn't apply to intellectual property because there isn't scarcity, which is the fundamental basis of property rights. Plus, I'm producing my own property, not stealing yours (even if it's derived from information you thought of first).
I think you could maybe make a convincing argument for IP as a moral right, I just don't think you're doing a very good job of it.

You aren't making any arguments, just making declarative statements that you decided are true.

Who get's to decide that someone has an explicit "individual right" to intellectual property?
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:19:48
Property rights presuppose scarcity. I don't know what else to tell you.

So, no examples then?
