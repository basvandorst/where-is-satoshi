After releasing last years poorly designed but somewhat relevant list I announced last wed that by next week the top 3 gambling list with all 30+ screenshots of myself wins only + videos of me playing dice + methods and it will be accurate!

I remember all of the articles and the several "bitcoin price experts" during the last week or so when bitcoin price was over 1000 and the New Year was just about to start i remember how many people wrote these poll posts like What do you predict bitcoin price to be at the end of january and the only choices were like A) Hover at $1000 B) $2500 C) $10,000 D) Greater than 10k
Yea and the majority of people actually had similar thoughts and look what happened to the price after that january 2014 month. 
The fact is that btc price has been going at a time insane rate of increase then suddenly today I was just about to sell a small amount of btc on local Bitcoin's and haven't hadn't received the deposits yet but knew what trade iwas going to use and had 0.5 btc in the advertisements converter for roughly $270.00 CAD and when i actually was about to initate the trade about 90 minutes later the price had dropped over 60$ usd making my return on 0.5 btc change to just above $200 CAD 
Now that is way too unpredictable and the fact that no site or news blog could accurately explain the sudden change in the bitcoin price makes me think that by tomorrow evening that price could be less than half of the current exchange.
