How might such a takeover succeed and how does hashing power prevent this?
Are takeovers being attempted?

Why do you oppose an increase?

Some think it will continue, and some do not. It looks like a speculative boom to many and those are hard to predict. I mean, it's easy to say there will be a bust, but it's hard to know when or at what price.
You could buy today and double your money by Jan 1, or you could buy today and lose most the value within a week and not recover for over a year. I don't know.

"Investments" that can't outperform money aren't worth making.

The inflationary nature of our money supply encourages savers to "invest" as a hedge against inflation. This increases demand for places to invest, channeling money into ventures that would otherwise be submarginal. These savers would lose this incentive with a deflationary currency, and non-savers would gain an incentive to save. Saving is good for individuals to protect against uncertainty, and I maintain that it's good in the aggregate as well. 


Is there something inherently unstable about a deflationary currency? If bitcoin became the world's reserve currency, it would be more stable than the current major currencies of the world, and it would not be monetarily deflationary, as the supply of bitcoin would not shrink. Price deflation with a fixed (or nearly fixed) money supply results from increased purchasing power brought about by economic growth, which results from successful investments. 
Now, I don't claim to be an expert in Bitcoin or cryptos generally, so I don't know all the vulnerabilities or how possibile it is to scale to such a level. I'm also aware that the end of USD hegemony will bring great unpleasantness, but I also think it's ultimately unavoidable. I'm not certain that our magical internet money is the answer, though. With cryptos, I've already scene situations where crypto banks could get away with fractional reserve banking. This inherently unstable practice would inflate the money supply and cause inaccuracies in economic calculation, especially if it's done dishonestly and/or secretly. This monetary inflation would occur on top of a fixed monetary base and would necessarily lead to contractions.
All this to acknowledge that a cryptocurrency in wide-spread use as money, is not necessarily stable, but I will argue that price deflation itself is not a sign or cause of instability.

You're saying people will rob each other to avoid spending the money have BECAUSE they it expect it to rise in value?

Do you really want an answer? That's tangential to what I'm arguing. The anti-deflation argument is that deflation is bad because it would prevent investments which cannot outperform the deflationary currency. I maintain that such investments aren't worth it in the aggregate, and that they only make sense personally as a hedge against an inflationary currency. Economic growth that causes price deflation is the result of successful investments, those which outperform money.

What on God's green Earth are you talking about then? This was a conversation about DEFLATION, where prices go down, not up!

Can you elaborate on these checkpoints?  
On the security point, I assume you're referring to the relative mining power?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:08:24
Yes, I was hearing recently how Bitcoin has become more of a "store of value" than a spendable currency with high tx costs and retailers getting away from it, and I'm just thinking how it doesn't actually have much value if it fails at being money, considering how that's the whole idea.

These cards wouldn't exist were it not for gaming. That is what they're made for. Manufacturers might be responding to this new use, but they're unsurprisingly cautious about increasing production as crypto-mining demand is new and difficult to predict.

You can, but you shouldn't.  Savings accounts pay interest and are denominated in some kind of money.
