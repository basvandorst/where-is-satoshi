No not my own money. He was going to send me a 1K cheque to my e-mail... I deposit it into my account, take out 800 (since i'd get to keep 200) and deposit that into the ATM. But yeah not doing it after reading the responses!

Okay so super weird question here... Here goes. I'm pretty much a bitcoin newb. My sibling is VERY into bitcoin so I know the jist of it and how it works. But onto my weird question... I basically got offered by a sugar daddy type person to do his bitcoin deposits for him at a bitcoin ATM and he'd pay me an allowance each time I do it. And it's a good amount of money he's offering.
But obviously I have some reservations. I asked him why he doesn't do it himself (since that set off a red flag) and he said he could but he wants to help people out who might need money (like me if I do it for him). But other than that it sounds kinda sketchy and this is where my question lies... I know bitcoin is a VERY safe way of exchanging money since your wallet identity is public when you trade, but is this sketchy at all? Could I get in trouble in any way by doing this for him? All he says I need to do is go to a bitcoin ATM, deposit the money into the wallet he provides and that's it. And i'm down to do it for him, but i'm a little worried maybe he wants the money put towards something illegal or nefarious and i'd get caught as the one putting the money in since i'd be the one caught on camera... Idk, maybe i'm just being too careful haha, but do let me know.
Sorry for this weird question :P
Edit: Thanks for the responses! Needless to say, i'll be blocking this guy and NOT engaging in this lol.

The thousand would have been in my debit account initially. Then I take out 800 and the 200 stays in my account. The first red flag for me was a stranger would trust me to take out the 800 and not just keep the thousand for myself and block him lol.

I won't. I'm glad I asked here and didn't foolishly agree haha.
