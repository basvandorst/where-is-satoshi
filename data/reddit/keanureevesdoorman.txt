Is the Coinbase vault more secure than leaving it on the exchange?

Let’s Coinbase charge a fee to transfer USD back to bank accounts?

It won’t matter when you buy in when it’s over 30k next summer!

So you suspect that btc could go down as futures trading begins?  Or do you mean long term?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:15
Can regular people get in on shorting? If so, how?

Sure, why not.  But it’s also viable to invest that amount and lose half its value.
Nothing is guaranteed.  As nice as it would be to turn that 500 into 1000 - you have to be just as comfortable with that 500 turning into 250. 
You’re not going to make a ton of money investing such a small amount anyways.  Think about it - bitcoin has gone up about 45% in the past week.  187% in the last month.
500 invested a week ago would yield you 725 today.  500 invested a month ago would yield you 1435.  
Is the risk of losing your 500 worth gaining 225 or 935 a week or month from now?
If answer is yes, then do it. If answer is no, then don’t.

Futures trading opens up Sunday night, with Monday being first full day.
My concern is that - along with speculative future buyers come those who stand to profit for the fall of bitcoin - i.e. those who short it.
So while at the moment everyone who owns stands to gain by the price increasing, that could all change quickly when others trade shorts betting against the rise, and thus dragging the value down.

The transfer still takes 2-5 business days tho.

So does GDAX allow users to control the private key?

But...could you elaborate?

I have objections - not with the prediction but with the assertion.
Typically financial predictions or forecasts have supporting facts behind them.  What you’ve provided is a guess.
What’s your “prediction” of how many fingers I’m holding up?
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:23:21
Well I know what I’m watching today.

More powerful than this image? Yes. Normandy. Pearl Harbor. Tiananmen square. MLK marches. Tigers winning the World Series. But sure, a bunch of people holding up cell phones for light does the trick.
Cool moment, dumb question.
