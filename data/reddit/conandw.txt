I just wanted it. When it became difficult I pushed through. I reccomend learn Javascript not Java. Javascript is modern and well used. Java is aging.

My dad makes minimum wage and I'll be moving out of this house to work full-time as soon as I turn 18, so he can focus on supporting my younger brother. I very much look forward to earning money instead of debt, and believe I have a good life ahead of me.
If you know someone needing a website or a programming assistant, please reach out. I buy all my own computers, and might need to move across country to find a suitable position, outside of Amish country.
Thank you for your help, here's my website  for those interested.

First episode is up and there's more to come! I have designed 5 websites and can get you on the web. If you know anyone that needs a web presence send them my way.

Junior in High School doing a Mastering Bitcoin read through and spreading the coding knowledge of the blockchain. Self-taught and free lance developer, Cameron Day Custom Websites. I will NOT be going into debt out of High School, but I WILL be getting paid to code, and will be investing my money into business and Bitcoin! Like any RESPONSIBLE 16 yr old should be doing!
If there are other high schoole'rs looking to get into coding, I'd love to start a business partnership where we find each other work and maximize our business knowledge that is NOT taught in schools. We must do it ourselves: Shame upon the system!
If you are eager to make it in this crazy world, and don't want to pay $100,000 for a $20 / hour job certificate, let's amplify our strengths and make an empire.
Join up, and find me on Youtube!

Also I can't run it on Ubuntu but can on winblows since it is cheaper to run a full node :( Does it run on Windows well? I know that some python scripts I have made haven't ran well. Thanks!

Will try since I am a python developer at heart. Can I be done remotely using RPC?
