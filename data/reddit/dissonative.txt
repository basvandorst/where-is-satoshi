Oh yeah, its all totally just a ploy to make money. That's why he donates his $400k annual salary to charity
*rolls eyes*

Do you have a source for this claim?

This is a perfect use case for crypto: fighting authoritarian censorship. 
Stop being so fucking butthurt because you don't like the guy's following

Oh god, not this pathetic "technicality" again.
So you must be staunchly opposed to net neutrality then yeah? After all, corporations (ISPs in this case) are free to restrict their services however they wish, as long as they're not the government, right?
Fuck outta here.

I'm watching it crack as we speak. Pulled out @ $4580.
Not looking so good in the short term.
5min chart: 
Expecting a pullback to *at least* $4400.
Honestly I hope it does cause at this point I'm only trading to acquire more BTC :D

I pulled out at $4700 because I saw some bearish signs.
It then proceeded to push $5k but in the end I was vindicated! Ha!
Now to find a new buy-in point.. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:48:55
Agreed. I'm waiting to see what it does around $4k - $4.2k.
Any reason you think Tuesday? I assume that's cause that's the start of the work week again. I'm used to stocks and not currencies that trade 24/7. Not sure how they act on weekends in terms of volume.

Apparently not

God these guys are a couple of knobs.
Why do they keep showing up here?
Last I heard from them, they were challenging people to short BTC if they were so sure it was a bubble. Next thing we know, down to $6k from $20k, during which period they were remarkably silent. 
Now at the first sign of a rebound they're out flapping their lips again? It's like that one guy at the office who got lucky on one stock pick and feels like he can start giving trading advice to everyone else.
