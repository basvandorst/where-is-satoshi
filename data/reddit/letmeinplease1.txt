Yes and No, as a country we decide what the government does. if everyone wants to pay taxes in crypto then we would get to. at least in Canada. I'm confident that when the time comes i wont have to switch back into dollars to pay stupid bills.

@_date: 2018-01-16 17:35:21
i started with 2000 in september and now at 69000.
Neo, Omg, Ltc,Cvc,Sub,burst,Redd, got me there. 
things to look forward to with similar returns IMO are red pulse, qlink,reddcoin,burst,neo,sub,vert,Nebl, Powr, all are a great price today. 
Enjoy, be greedy, its all in or nothing. good luck.

If everything goes as planned you will be able to earn Substratum (or atoms) for allowing an app to use your phone as a host. Now that i write it out its essentially staking. But i dont think you have to own any.

@_date: 2017-11-02 06:28:36
correct you cant link a canadian bank to coinbase. american i'm not sure if your a canadian.. i used quadrigacx.com and then moved my bitcoin to bittrex and binance to trade... it makes no difference where you buy except for fee's... u can buy from a atm and use etherdelta.com to trade without sign up.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:07:48
just takes time, the link i sent you will help
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:19:35
you do realize that any publicity for crypto is a good thing right. i dont like bitcoin cash either but i'd still endorse it if it meant money coming into the space.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:32:51
same, but bitcoin needs a correction... so if it's not right now expect it soon
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:55:14
People ride the prefork wave with everyone else who wants free money from the fork ... upon receiving said free money the people who were simply riding it for the free forked money quickly put there money back into alts... this is also why most alts fall before every bitcoin fork that has happened.... in the last few weeks the market has not gained much "new money" it has just shifted from alts to bitcoin... (we can tell this because the total market cap hasnt changed much) just like the 2 previous forks you will see bitcoin drop instantly after the fork and that money shift back into alts... now because there's constant small amounts of new money coming in the support levels for bitcoin rise each time... but for experienced crypto traders this is such an easy way to make money... also if you dont believe me ... you dont have to the proof is in the numbers.... 
the last fork was not as drastic although but if you consider bitcoin fell 10% and alts rose 10% plus the difference in bitcoin price you capture because of its drop.... well thats a nice profit on a simple swing trade.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:52:29
wait until the fork happens on the 15th. bitcoin will drop substantially. if your looking for long term that is , short term is great just sell on the 15th immediately after the fork
 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:51:56
never heard of them , and not to be rude but thats a very small market. and i bet your kicking yourself for the amount you've spent there because it's now 3X just in the last month lol exactly my point as to why it doesnt matter about fee's or speed at this point in time.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:07:00
so because asain markets didnt make a change to the price does this mean that none of them were staking in order to get 2X coins?  Is this just an western priority?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:57:29

Well said... although i do love getting into emotional arguments with teenagers ahah..
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:29:37
bitcoin will be at its lowest price immediately after the fork.. dont FOMO and buy now.. wait til right after the fork..
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:17:32
Candians are limited with options, you can buy coins with a credit card on most sites but you will not be able to turn those coins into fiat except for on quadrigacx.com(BC based-richmond) where you can link a bank account and have money go to and from or with the use of a ATM... both charge fee's... The problem with using quadgrigacx.com is that it's trading volume is low and doesnt offer many coins... i suggest using quad to link your bank account, buy bitcoin , then send that bitcoin to another exchange where you can do the bulk of your trading, such as Binance, or Bittrex.( i use both) and when i need to i send my BTC to quadriga and withdraw through my bank account. you will only be charged a fee when taking money from a bank or a exchange because they obviously want to keep your money in their system.  most accounts take a few days to verify so start signing up for multiple exchanges today... hope this helps, feel free to ask any other questions you might have and also for great information on the market check out data-dash on youtube and reddit(best source of help/info i've found)

Binance.com fee's are 50% off if you pay in BNB(binance coin)... i made 6 trades today... total cost around 2$
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:10:46
no one accepts any crypto at this point! and if they did no one would want to spend theirs anyways due to fear of being the next 2 large pizza story we all know so well(unless they've been in the space for years and already made their massive gains) ... the war between BTC and BCH is hilarious to those who realize they are 2 completely different coins. there is only controversy because they share a name... if they didnt share a name no one would care... and if your looking for a fast payment low cost coin there are many others with better tech in the space.... its a pissing match to those who want to fight but for everyone else its funny
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:43:04
Not sure what you mean. But BCH is a fast,cheap way to spend your crypto.. used for day to day transactions like coffee or gas.. where as BTC is more of a store of value now due to the amount of traffic it has... its too expensive to use for day to day things.. they can co-exist so no need to choose sides.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:46:06

ahaha i sold already into alts... this BCC &amp; BTC thing right now is insane! check out live feed on youtube -data dash
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:20:09
i believe all sites you can purchase with a credit card. the difference in exchanges is what coins they offer, volume of coins traded,and fees. I use binance because its relatively cheap and you can get 50% off in fees if you pay in binance coin, also it has most of the newest coins other than a few that i usually find on bittrex. You can also use etherdelta.com which is a decentralized exchange and requires no sign up at all you just link your wallet to the site while trading. Which coins are you looking at? or just bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:30:38
Yes you can use kraken.. you can also use coinbase to buy bitcoin or others and then send it to kraken...Coinbase does have higher fees than some exchanges though... if you go to  you will be able to see where the bulk of trading is happening for  bitcoin... this is viewable for all coins of CMC. each exchange trades at a slightly different price.. for instance in zimbabwea 1 BTC is around 10,000USD because of the demand and lack of cash in the country... i should also mention that if your planning to hold your BTC through the fork and capture free coins that some exchanges dont support the fork(or at least the last one) meaning they awarded no coins to BTC holders on that exchange... but i think this fork is mostly supported by all exchanges but be sure to check...     anything else i can help with?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:57:40

they must! lol... or i'm wrong ... lets hope i'm not... for my alt portfolio sake... regardless everything already got a good boost and i locked in some profits... if it starts to rally then back to BTC i go.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:43:51
ahahah 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:32:36
whats so hard? i find every exchange the same.other than volume and coins offered... switch to binance for trading and just use quadriga or an ATM to withdraw
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:59:17
you have this backwards.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:37:33

@_date: 2017-11-13 05:09:41
I feel with the whole s-korea pump into BCC it spend up the correction... i think the dip is over but we will stay around 6100 until the dust settles... without the pump of BCC i think we would defiantly still be on the down trend.

where in van is this?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:36:15
no stock run's up forever without a pullback and solidification of price... we have support at 7100 but we havnt hung out there very long and below that the next level of support is 6100... so IMO i think we are due for a pull back.. especially with this news.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:47:38
i'm also not a believer in bitcoin long-term. it will fall to something superior .. whats the saying  " first guy through the door gets shot". 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:59:38
etherdelta.com is a decentralized exchange that links to wallets to trade... the only way to acquire bitcoin or alts without registering a name is via ATM, or purchase from someone who already owns it and have it directly sent to your wallet.... if you know someone who is already trading or set up you can simply email them money and have them send you the correct amount of BTC, ETH, ect....  as for USD in paypal i'm unsure... you could send money from paypal to a friend?  hope that helps.

there are 1/1000000 horror stories of people having their accounts hacked... it's not likely but if your not trading it regularly and just holding long term then why chance it.. A exchange is not decentralized and can be hacked.

Etherium? ahah no worries... Enjoy the ride!  Almost anything that can be re-written onto the block-chain is being done as we speak.. and being represented by a coin... For instance a few i would keep an eye on if i were you would be 1) Redpulse (decentralized social media platform)... countries like china dont have facebook.. this could fix that.  2) Qlink(not out yet) -(decentralized mobile network) - imagine not paying candian prices for cell phones/internet and having it owned by the people not by Telus or Bell.. 3)Chainlink (smart contracts)- if you dont know what smart contracts are watch a youtube video on them.. they in theory could revolutionize alot of industries(eg, paying employees). 4) Neo - (China's Etherium but aplications can be built in existing code eg. java, C+, Instead of ETH's new coding language only)
And many more but there are a few and lots more everyday! Enjoy.. my advice , dont put all ur egg's in one basket... unless that basket is bitcoin... then by all means but know that alot of people dont see it being king forever. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:34:56
sure but everyone stay at home son sleeps in. lol... maybe not today but soon ... last level of serious support we saw was 6100... or 100B market cap... i think we could see a pull back to there... which would be reasonable..

good point, but inform others why you like a certain coins instead of just saying neo, ark, ect..

@_date: 2017-09-30 17:32:11
waiting for china isnt a smart move.. sure they have effect on the market and most likely it will mean regulation but they most certainly wont want to miss out on all the cash ... this being widely know means most prices will run up in october then jump even higher when china jumps back in .. so the time to buy was when china announced they were shutting down.. which was a month ago.. so if ur waiting thats a good thing for the rest of us who are already in but a bad thing for yourself..... In my opinion of course.. but its basic psychology

some exchanges arent accepting new customers. but there are over 1000 exchanges. They can be found here in order of volume traded. I personally have 4 accounts on different exchanges. arbitrage trading is useful and each exchange offers different cryptos.

This man spoke to the Canadian senate and because of this Canada has a bullish stance on Crypto! Glad to have you on our side sir!
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:01:19
nope, but how many people will avoid crypto because they dont understand it?  compare that to the amount of people who understand crypto and its inn's and outs and choose not to invest. i'd be willing to bet that when provided with more information you'll find a correlation between people willing to invest... its like teaching people about healthy eating and their weight, the ill informed masses are obese but the people who spend the time to learn about nutrition are usually healthier.. Do you concur? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:00:35

They can force you to use whatever currency they like when it comes to paying taxes,medical bills or transportation costs. anything government run they can force you to use their choice of fiat to pay.. unfortunately... now people will always find a way around that but i highly doubt that you'll be able to pay your taxes in crypto any time soon.

@_date: 2017-09-27 23:32:44
from a journalists perspective those are none credible sources though... i want to believe you but the first article is written from a Pro bitcoin site which makes it bias and the second is a reddit post... do you have any hard evidence?.. i want to believe you and i suspect your right but those articles aren't admissible.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:54:16
Do you think that profits from bitcoin will be tax free.. or if you spend them anywhere that there will be no tax? i think your dreaming if you believe you can purchase anything other than crypto without paying tax on it.. the government in all cases will still be taking tax from our profits....

agreed.. it's impossible to spot the swingers without being on it all the time.. you have to be on it daily, a few times a day... or put your money in a smart long term and forget about it... i put a bunch into NEO due to it's gas earnings and locked it in a safe... and watch and trade daily when the market allows me to... i'd recommend kyber network atm if u have the right exchange profiles..

Quadrigacx.com is the option for canadians looking to move money to and from their bank accounts, once you purchase on quadriga you can then transfer your crypto to another site and do more trading/investing.  Different exchanges have different coins and volume levels.. you can find this information on Coinmarketcap.com , Once you own your coins you'll want to keep them in a wallet. different wallets for different coins.. also some coins award you for holding them which is a good way to earn on top of your investment.

@_date: 2017-10-05 05:21:04
go with volume over cost. when you're up even a little you'll care more about trading volume and safety.. so stick with Bittrex, Binance or other large exchanges... they are centralized so not as safe as storing it in a wallet (ledger nano s) but they are still quite secure.

I suggest watching datadash on YouTube. Guys been pretty great at predictions and a very realistic take on the market. If your thinking of buying bitcoin give him a listen . I just put a buy order in but for a lot lower than what it is now. I predict 34-3500 then rally. Biased on past high to low % dips.

If its used to buy good like regular fiat then it falls into the same tax bracket as cash... if you use it as a investment then its "capital gains" tax.. at least in canada... you wouldnt tax someone for turning all their peso's into USD and spending it.

its a currency. you need to join a currency echange or find a Bitcoin ATM. then u need a wallet to put them in. meaning a program. laptop or cellphone will work , or you can buy a trezor or ledger nano s (fancy encrypted usb stick) if your worried about safety. or you can leave your bitcoin on a exchange. . Once you have bitcoin you can watch it on coinmarketcap.com ... you'll also find the exchanges on there that offer BTC and other cryptos. I'd recommend trading on a platform that has large volume such as Binance or Upbit.. good luck and whatever you do, just HODL

their recent news said they will be the choice of payment for online bills in parts of asia/hopefully more countries to come... They have ties to the mitsubishi corp(which has ties to 50+ countries) .. also their partnership with the worlds largest restaurant chain is a great thing.. and Vitalik being an advisor isnt going to hurt them.. i predict the majority of Asian coins to have a great bump later this month (october 18-19) after the congressional meeting in china.. i feel it was a publicity stunt for china to halt trading(which in turn stalled the whole market ) just so their citizens didn't miss out on too much profit.. all speculation but i feel the asian coins will dominate pending news from china and i'm willing to bet china will not miss out on this gold rush.. and OMG was needing a pullback after its last run-up and its getting it right before the congress meeting....go figure.. hold on to your hats/wallets.. its gunna be a good christmas season!

in theory they could be a problem, but when they are we will simply make better locks using the same technology. So ying yang really. As long as we continue to adopt bitcoin and fix it as it is attacked the ecosystem will get stronger. Think of it as a global organism, as it gets sick (attacked) the other parties immediately eradicate the problem. Its not going anywhere.

antisipating the markets moves from news headlines and buying and selling multiple times in a day capturing profit with each trade.. EG, NEO has a event coming up on OCT 9th and because of this will most likely see a small bump in price on that day.  knowing this you can buy in first thing in the morning , keep your eye on the market and sell when its up a few%.. 
Some news dates for this month can be found here

It may be because China has a congressional meeting on Oct 18th, so people are tightening up... In my opinion.. When they said regulations are needed before continuing the market lost around 30% ... I'm loading up on everything cheap right now and expect it to Pop regardless of what news comes from oct 18.good or bad people will feel better knowing china's mind is made up. also think long term .. all markets do this
