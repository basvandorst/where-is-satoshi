Yeah, I don't see no issue keeping a couple of hundred/grand in exchanges.
I know Coinbase can get hacked (obviously), but to be honest Coinbase is one of the leading market exchange  leader in the world and I'm sure they invested in some good security by now. Think of the shit storm Coinbase will get if he ever gets hacked. People with pitch forks will be storming their HQ in San Francisco lol

Yep, Spread betting can be the devil. I use to do that years ago on Gold and Crude Oil. 
I remember on one trade with Crude Oil I put £50 per point. The thing with Crude Oil is that it is volatile as fuck. In a matter of seconds it can fluctuate up or down. Well anyways, my stop was relatively low as I was an idiot trying to get rich quick and in the span of 30 seconds, I made £400. Watched it climb higher and higher for it to drop back down.
I was weak and had no discipline in spread betting. I quit shortly after.

A hacker got hold of a Mt. Gox auditor's credentials. So yeah, a human issue. Given this was in 2011, where was his 2fac lol?

That’s the news for ya. 
Most news companies will mislead people to get their attention causing widespread panic.
@_date: 2019-07-09 13:17:51
Lol? That's not how it works son.

Yes, Dogecoin.

It's Plymouth though, way outside of central London.
It's usually like £5 an hour in London.

Don't spend it all at once bro

I don't really understand when newspapers print out stock, shares, etc prices. Given that it was at that price point when it is about to be printed. But from getting it printed to delivering the newspapers to the public, the prices can be changed significantly in that amount of time.
Didn't BTC shoot from $10k to $14k in a matter of hours a few weeks ago?
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:46:42
Memes will start coming again when it hits 14k+ again. 
For now, it’s good seeing it go up slowly.

Scroll down in comments and pay respect to the guy who brought 40BTC for $40 and reset his phone...
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:52:31
To be fair, you're asking a really good question.
My thoughts are just like yours, but I do believe we will eventually be using some type of digital currency form. It may not be Bitcoin, Libra or any altcoins though. At this day and age we're using smart phones and watches to pay for every day items! 
People are carrying less coins and paper these days, so I feel like the future will create some type of digital currency form that is stable enough to replace your existing countries currency. Or better yet, a "global" currency.
But yeah, in my opinion I don't think Bitcoin is stable enough to be the "global" currency yet, but it's a start to something big in the future.

Curious also.
I know many people will be so tempted to cash out if they invested like $100 and seeing it reach $10,000 back then.
But man, I'd be really surprised if this guy held out since 2015 till today and haven't cashed out since.

If you can own 1 whole Bitcoin, you’ll be laughing son. Watch those profits roll in.

Are you actually asking strangers on the internet whether or not you should spend your money on something you do not understand on?
Not actually sure what kind of answer you want? I'm sure there will be a kind Redditor who will write up the Pros and Cons of investing into Bitcoin, but realistically, all you want to hear is "Yes, invest $X and you'll see $XXX,XXXX in X years!!!!".
@_date: 2019-06-01 22:38:17
Dude seems like he bought Bitcoin like a week ago. Some of us been holding for years...
He should just gamble instead next time.

Ah, they're finally onto us.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:56:32
Yeah this.
Probably going into overdraft so watch out for those interest or over the limit fees.
@_date: 2019-06-14 09:40:49
I'm not sure about this one. 
You can't really compare cryptocurrencies to commodities. Not really the same in my opinion.

The majority of newcomers are impatient. That's the problem.
They want to get rich quick and expect Bitcion to jump $1k every day. My advice is, if newcomers want to play in the fast lane, trade Crude Oil.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:16:25
Coinbase is actually fine for newcomers to be honest. If you’re holding a couple of hundred to a grand in Coinbase, I’d say it’s fine.
It’s when you start making over 5 digits or 6, then you should start thinking about a hardware wallet.
