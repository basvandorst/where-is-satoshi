What I mean by trust is this: if you tell your wallet application (assuming your wallet application is not malicious/glitchy) to send Alice 5 bitcoins, you can be confident that your transaction will eventually go through. You have no worries about a middleman needing to approve your transaction or freezing it, and because you are sending bitcoin directly to Alice there is no way someone could take the bitcoins you want to send and "run off" with them.
By buying Bitcoin from an online exchange, you have to trust that the third party will send your currency to the recipient and will send you the appropriate bitcoin. There is no protocol for that transaction that does not trust the online exchange, leaving your assets at the mercy of that exchange service.
I mentioned faucets don't need trust because faucets don't cost you any currency. Even if the faucet doesn't pay out, you haven't lost any currency by using it. By using a nonBTC to BTC exchange or vice versa, you must trust that the third party will carry out the exchange truthfully.
I thought part of the point of BTC is to allow for transactions without trust in the middleman, but exchanging via an online service defeats that trust, doesn't it?

Newbie question here: If the network hard forks, will your private key on each network give access to both your BTC Classic coin as well as  the new BTC? And would that mean your public address would be the same across both networks?

How do you suggest one would aquire bitcoins then? Purely through faucets? It is bitcoin's problem if people aren't willing to aquire bitcoin through other currencies, because then there would be very little traffic on the bitcoin network and therefore its usability and value would go down
