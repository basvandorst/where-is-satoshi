Paypal has apparently agreed to accept (and immediately sell for fiat) Bitcoin on behalf of the merchants who already use them. This is going to cause enormous downward pressure
Big deal. It is a necessary step in the development of the ecosystem. PayPal has 117 million active users - that is a heck of a lot of bitcoin brand recognition among people already engaged in internet commerce.

Seems unlikely. It didn't even go under $400 following the Gox collapse.

You can buy gift cards with bitcoin for all of those companies (gyft.com), which is where the confusion probably stems from. Far cry from them directly accepting it obviously. 
Goes to show how trustworthy/accurate the media often is.

The people in power already have anonymity under the current financial paradigm. The government can spy on an individual's finances but we are not privy to the details of what they are doing with our money. Bitcoin (_using the proper precautions such as darkwallet_) just levels the playing field.

I would assume so. At least that's the case with other companies that use the Coinbase API, such as Overstock. Guess we'll see soon enough.

Did you try contacting support?
It happened to me once and they were able to fix it, but that was nearly a year ago.

this is not creating new users for bitcoin, this is creating new users for paypal.
PayPal has 152 million active users. Maybe 2 or 3 million people currently use Bitcoin. 
And who knows? Maybe they'll buy out or compete with Coinbase and offer Bitcoin purchase via ACH withdrawal. They're already set up for it. That would change the whole game.

Yes. I put it in quotes because the protocol itself is not going anywhere but they could have significantly stymied its adoption. However now it is no longer politically expedient to even do that, at least not on the national scale.

They seem to be focusing on the international and / or remittance markets, which in the long-run is probably more important than U.S.-centric retailer acceptance.

Not sure why anyone is surprised. The Ebay CEO confirmed this during an interview 3 months ago, with the below quote. Did people think he was lying? I guess seeing his believing. 
“I think there’s no doubt digital currency is going to play an important role going forward, and at PayPal, we’re going to have to integrate digital currencies into our wallet,” Donohue told CNBC.

Back in the spring they also opened a South American HQ in Argentina, a country notorious for loose monetary policy. I remember them sponsoring some sort of seminar / hackathon there to promote its adoption among young people.

Weak. Try localbitcoins.com. You can meet up with someone for cash or more likely do a bank transfer. It is very safe as long as you're dealing with a seller with a good reputation/a lot of successful transactions.
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:46:38
Of course the retailers are going to cash out most if not all of the coin. But you've got to start somewhere. It is a necessary step in the evolution of the ecosystem. It further legitimizes Bitcoin and gets the 'brand' in front of tens of millions of people.
Also the eBay CEO has said that they will "have to" implement Bitcoin, so it is only a matter of time. Once that happens I can't imagine Amazon.com will be too far behind.
If you want to treat it as an investment, you have to remember that it is speculative and relatively long-term. This is about fundamentally altering the entire financial paradigm, not a get-rich-quick scheme.

Best option is to find a nearby seller on localbitcoins, meet up, and pay with cash.
Of course the premiums on there are high but you can probably negotiate better prices for bulk purchases; you just need to spend some time and effort developing a relationship with trustworthy, high-volume sellers.
Or skip localbitcoins and just go to a bitcoin meetup, bitcoin.meetup.com and try and find someone (an early adopter) willing to sell. Either way of course never mention anything illegal when proposing a transaction. 
They don't make it easy to buy btc anonymously anymore but it is certainly possible.

I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers are accurate. Most of the people I talk to, including older non-techie people, have at least a vague understanding of what it is. They've read about GOX in the Wall Street Journal or whatever. They just haven't become users yet. The technological infrastructure behind it hasn't matured to that point. No big deal; I'm sure plenty of people also knew of cell phones before they became ubiquitous. 
Not that I think mass adoption is even necessary for bitcoin to be wildly successful. It is just as much about the quality of the users as the quantity.

It is a subsidiary of PayPal that handles payment processing for a large number of popular tech startups like Airbnb, Uber, and OpenTable.

Every day it is becoming more difficult politically to 'ban' bitcoin. The last chance they really had to stop it was at that Senate hearing late last year, and their failure to act gave a green light for institutional involvement. At this point the establishment is already neck deep in the space, I mean the head of Coinbase is a former Goldman Sachs executive.

A poll last month showed about half of registered voters are at least somewhat aware of it.
