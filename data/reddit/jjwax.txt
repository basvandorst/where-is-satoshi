are you wanting to mine BTC?  Your efforts will be wasted with your hardware

Because their are entire datacenters with ASICs set up to mine bitcoin - that blow the hashing power of any GPU out of the water.
I'm not saying you could never mine any BTC with your rig (you could join a pool and receive a fraction of a payout), but your odds are astronomically low.  You'd probably have a better return buying scratch off lottery tickets.
I'd probably check out a simpler program like nicehash if you want to test the waters.  You can look at  to see what your GPU is roughly capable of earning in a month, minus electricity costs.  You didn't state the exact GPU you have, gut if you have a vega64, looks like you can earn about $90 USD/month currently
