People who don't own one of the big 3 ISPs should be pro net neutrality.  There's no real good argument against it for anyone else.

It'll go back up.  Just hold it and wait.  If you want you can sell and take the losses but what would be unethical and possibly prevent you from ever using coinbase again would be intentionally bouncing the transaction

What are you 5?  They totally did exist.  Hell google Comcast and Verizon court and peering.  They just decided randomly "fuck this we don't want to provide service let's leave all these links as slow as we can even though our customers paid us to provide connectivity."  Are you saying AOL never existed?

Like I said in my other comment 
How is having an unregulated monopoly good? I'd agree with you IF it was legal and POSSIBLE to create a competing business. Here's a hint Alphabet failed and they're one of the biggest companies to exist...Also see Virginia, NY, and other states that gave Comcast and VZW tax money to provide service that never got delivered. As it stands ISPs are part of government they should be regulated OR be forced to allow competition. Since the second isn't even close to happening that leaves the first.  Net neutrality is anti centralization.
Edit:  as for bad reviews Comcast, TWC, and VZW are already 3 of the most hated companies in existence they can't be reviewed much worse.  They're also the only option for 95 percent of the country and even then its only one of the 3.

I'm very pro net neutrality but its not an attack on bitcoin or any other currency.  Verizon and Comcast have been trying to repeal it since it went in place.

Yeah half the internet dropping away every few months when vzw and Comcast decided they didn't want to peer or upgrade was wonderful.  The days when ISPs own pages were all you visited were great weren't they?

It doesn't fully solve it no...but it does mitigate the damage having only monopolies creates.  The larger issue has been a problem since bell labs in the 30s openly burning down competion..eventually they were separated as a monopoly but it was a short term solution and only created 3 new monopolies just separated by area that eventually re merged.  The only viable way to do a true free market internet at this point is to split all the giant telecoms into 800 different pieces (not happening), or to get every city, state, and town in the US to change the laws that make it illegal and impossible to start an ISP which is also more or less impossible at this point.

Yes.  Credit and debit cards have tons of issues.  Though I'll admit it won't likely happen until all of us who are younger and not 90 stuck loving our shit gvmnt currency are taking over and even then maybe not until our grandkids.  The problem is more people hating better ideas than anything else if you ask me.  "Its our current system its broken but we love being more and more in debt because we have morons for leaders" only lasts so long before the better idea trumps

You don't get your btc or your account goes to red.  Possibly both if the bank declines and then charges you a fee for not having enough.

Depends where you live but a common site is localbitcoins and another is coinbase.
