the QR displayed was an invoice to receive 0.001 btc?

I believe big banks are already a dying breed. The only reason I use the banks is to deposit checks. Once I those are converted to cash, I usually give it back to them to exchange for bitcoin using localbitcoins.com. Cash may be king, but for me personally, bitcoin dominates. Plus, data is more powerful than paper these days..

At current rates, that is only a $0.27 USD deposit. It's possible the minimum deposit amount is 0.01 BTC or higher. Have you contacted Cloudbet?

By next move you mean bringing bitcoin to mainstream? In that case, it's already happening.. it won't be overnight..

Thanks, I'll be having fun with this. Appreciate the info!

Sites I have played with won't display such small deposits since they don't meet the minimum bet amount. That's the only thing I can think of.. maybe try depositing another 0.00882 to bring your total deposit balance to 0.01. If that doesn't work, I wouldn't play at that site.

How were you able to gather that information? I'm still a bitcoin noob (since 2012) 
@_date: 2015-05-09 22:56:32
Okay, I understand. But how did you manage to obtain the btc?

It would be cool if btcjam would allow you to take out a loan up to the amount you've previously invested, allowing a reputation to be built. Other than that, I'm not sure what would work as collateral without violating one's privacy.

Glad to see the bitcoin community persistent with talks about the future of money, exchange, and voting.

Hey Fold team! I've really enjoyed following your developments and I use your app quite often. I first heard about you guys several months ago while you were still working out some kinks in the app. First I remember, there were four options for Starbucks credit: $5, $10, $15, $20. Then, for a while it was only $5, and I found it difficult to purchase anything more than a single drink. I like the 4 options. Also, refunds weren't working the same as they are now. I don't mind using the site but I feel an actual app will help speed up adoption. The change feature is really nice. It would be awesome to have credit at stores when needed and be refunded bitcoin for the remaining balance.

Thanks! I agree refunding to bitcoin address is much better than e-mail. 
I was referring to the same model that's used for coffee for additional merchants. Example, I buy a $20 card to xStore for $16 (assuming 20% discount), then purchase $19 shirt, $0.80 would be refunded in bitcoin.
