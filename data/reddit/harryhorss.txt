Bitcoin mining does use a lot of energy but it's subsidised by the use of underutilised power stations who need bitcoin mining in order to not waste generated power. This incestivises new power stations to be built as without bitcoin they couldn't justify their existence without large population centres.

How so mate? You can't force people away from exchanges, it's their choice to hold their money there. Their money is centralised inside the exchanges wallet, but this says nothing about Bitcoin as a protocol failing to be decentralised. The Bitcoin protocol is working flawlessly in this regard, it's people that are choosing to centralise their funds with coinbase instead of being their own bank.
Over time and a few more Mt Gox disasters I'm sure that sentiment will change, but until that happens we're stuck with dumb people being dumb.

WU also require ID verification and you must accept their terms and conditions. Violate their TOS and you can no longer use their service. Or go to the wrong protest and you could be blacklisted by the Government from services like WU. 
With Bitcoin there is no TOS. No ID requirements. I can send Bitcoin to grandma from my living room and she can receive it in her living room without involving any third party and nobody needed to show their identification.
Scaling issues are happening right now (due to large scale adoption) with Bitcoin and it's resulting in fee competition, but there are solutions available but it takes the merchants to implement the technology. SWIFT/WU will need to adapt to Bitcoin (and they are) as they have a lot more barriers to entry and have a lot to be worried about once Bitcoin bitcoin does manage to scale.

You: can validate and verify transactions. If you used a block Explorer instead, you're outsourcing trust to them and cannot know what rules they're using to validate transactions. Don't trust, verify.
New nodes: if you have opened port 8333 and have synced the full chain, then you can now help seed other new node operators. Similar to seeding a torrent, the more seeders there are sharing blocks the faster it is to setup a new node for others. Running a full node with open port 8333 is the equivalent to running a 24/7 seed on a torrent.
Those are the two main things. Verifying your own transactions and helping others download the full chain so they can then verify their own transactions also.
With a full node you can then setup a lightning network node and build or participate in lightning apps

Good question!
Under normal situations it's best to route all of your traffic via a VPN to ensure your browsing is private. The problem is that VPN's don't allow port forwarding, meaning that you cannot accept incoming connections.
To run a full bitcoin node that also helps the network, you need to open port 8333 in order to accept incoming connections. Without opening port 8333 you can connect to other peers but they cannot connect to you, in torrenting terms you are a leech.
Normally you will not be able to run a VPN and run a full node that accepts inbound connections at the same time, with this guide it shows that you can essentially whitelist the bitcoin software so that your VPN doesn't touch your full node, whilst still routing all of your other traffic via your VPN to keep your real IP hidden for privacy.
The result is that all normal traffic is routed under your private VPN and your bitcoin full node is routed via your ISP's IP Address
Edit: As a user pointed out below I have made an error in my description, the port does not need to be 8333 specifically, this is just the port recommended in the Bitcoin wiki:

I didn't realize it at the time but that last transfer was into an address for a private key not generated from another public address like the first one.  Instead, this address was generated from a transaction id!  I had forgotten that I seeded my database with private keys generated with transaction ids as part of one of my earlier experiments.  I didn't label them so I didn't know which were from Sha256(pub address) and which were from transaction ids.  I found some hits at the time but when I checked the balances for those accounts, they were all zero and I didn't think anything of it.  But now my database was detecting ongoing transfers into THOSE addresses (transacton id based) too!
 
Okay, someone was possibly using information from the blockchain itself to ensure private keys were discoverable for the addresses they were funelling bitcoin into.  The interesting thing is I found a link between the 12fcWddtXyxrnxUn6UdmqCbSaVsaYKvHQp address (via sha of a public address) AND the 1LUqqMzaigWJTzaP79oxsD6zKGifokrh7p transfer (via the tx id as a key).  In the history of both of these addresses, you can see the BTC eventually ended up into this address: 1JCuJXsP6PaVrGBk3uv7DecRC27GGkwFwE
 
Also, the transaction id was for the previous transaction to the one that put the BTC in the toxic (discoverable) address in the first place.  Now it became even more clear.  The malicious code sometimes used a recent transaction id as the private key for the doomed destination address. Follow the .03 BTC back and you will see what I mean, you eventually get to the txid = private key for that discoverable address.
 
The 1JCuJXsP6PaVrGBk3uv7DecRC27GGkwFwE address is ONE of the collection addresses.  I have reason to believe there have been many over the years.  This one only goes back to approximately March 2017.  You can see in the history of this one address when they consolidated their ill-gotten gains into one transaction back to themselves.
 
I let my bot run longer. The next hit I got was for block hashes that were used as private keys (see Experiment   Sure enough, this address also had links to the 1JCuJXsP6PaVrGBk3uv7DecRC27GGkwFwE collection address!
 
And remember my merkle root experiment? I believe those were also part of this.  However, I have not linked those to this one particular collection address yet.  In the end, I found a total of four different 'discoverable' private key methods being used.
 
I made sure my database was filled with every block hash, merkle root, transaction id and Sha256(public address) for private keys and let my bot run.  Transactions for all four types were showing up, again for tiny amounts which I ignored. By this time, I was watching BTC getting taken in small amounts regularly. Sometimes, I saw as many as 6 transactions fly by in one day.
 
How fitwear lost (and got back) 9 BTC
 
On Nov 12, my program saw 9 BTC transferred into an address that my database had the private key for. I had searched for that address too to see if anyone was claiming ownership but I didn't see anything.  I decided to send a small amount to a well known puzzle address to give the transaction some public scrutiny in an anonymous way (1FLAMEN6, I'm still trying to solve this BTW).  Shortly after, I became aware of fitwear's reddit post claiming theft after someone noticed the prize amount had been topped off and linked the two events together.
 
I contacted fitwear privately and returned their coins minus the small amount I sent to the puzzle address.  Blockchain.info's original response to his support ticket, was that his system must have been compromised.  However, if you read his post, he took every precaution including typing in the key for his paper wallet instead of copy/paste and using 2FA.  
 
In his case, in Aug 2017, he imported the private key for his 1Ca15MELG5DzYpUgeXkkJ2Lt7iMa17SwAo paper wallet address into blockchain.info and submitted a test transaction.  At some point between then and Nov 12, the compromised 15ZwrzrRj9x4XpnocEGbLuPakzsY2S4Mit got into his online wallet as an 'imported' address.
 
Together, we contacted blockchain.info and I relayed the information I just outlined above to them.  Their security team investigated but found no evidence it was their system that was at fault. I suppose it's possible his system was somehow compromised back in August and managed to import a key into blockchain.info without him knowing it.  Or someone else logged into his account, imported the key, then waited.  I feel the malware/login explanations are much less likely because it looks like code attempting to 'hide in plain sight' to me.  You wouldn't need to use Sha256(address) or block hash or txid or merkleroot if you were malware or an unauthorized login.  You would at least salt or obscure the key with some bit of knowledge only you know so that only you could derive the private key (as mentioned earlier).  The fact that information from the blockchain itself is being used indicates it may be some transaction processing logic.  Also, fitwear took extreme precautions (you can read his reddit post for details).  The origin of these poison destination addresses remains a mystery.
 
If it's the case that some wallet generation code is doing this, then it may be the case that we're seeing 'change' transactions.  When you create a wallet, there maybe 20 addresses generated.  They are all supposed to be random keys.  If this rogue code creates one of them in this manner (based on the public address string of an earlier one), then at some point, your 'change' will get put back into it as the wallet 'round-robins' through the list.
 
fitwear's 15Z address sat unused until Nov 12 when fitwear transferred his 9 BTC into it using blockchain.info.
 
To see the connection, take a look at this:
 
echo -n "1Ca15MELG5DzYpUgeXkkJ2Lt7iMa17SwAo" | sha256sum
 
That hex number is the private key for 15ZwrzrRj9x4XpnocEGbLuPakzsY2S4Mit !!!
 
fitwear insists he did not import the key for that address.  Did Blockchain.info generate it or was it added by mallicious browser code? We may never know.
 
See below for the complete list of other Sha256 based addresses that suffer from the same issue. I believe this is happening for others.  It's likely, that the small amounts usually taken are going unnoticed by the owners.
 
What does this mean for bitcoin?  Nothing probably. I believe the bitcoin network itself to be secure.  However, as long as humans are involved in the services that surround it (mining pools, exchanges, online/mobile wallets) there is always a chance for fraud or error.  The bitcoin network itself may be 'trustless', but anything humans touch around its peripheries is certainly not.  And you need to use those services to get in/out of the network.  So even with bitcoin, it still boils down to trust.
 
To be fair to blockchain.info, only Sha256(public address) (one in particular) was found to be present in one of their wallets. The other 3 methods I described above could be completely unrelated.  And they could all possibly be a (really weird) software bug.
 
Here are 100+ addresses that received bitcoins whose private keys are the bytes resulting from Sha256 of another public address.  Most of these came from a scan I did of old transactions, not while my bot was running.  Blockchain.info told me they do not appear to have been generated by their system.
 
Also, the list of addresses I"m providing are only the subset that have already had some BTC transacted through them.  There are likely hundreds more lying dormant inside people's wallets that have not been used yet.

Hi.  Thanks for passing this along so it gets some attention.  I was worried if I posted this somewhere it would mostly go unnoticed.  Also, I'm trying to stay anonymous because I don't want to be accused of being the person who came up with this exploit or be blamed by any company for any damages.  It's an interesting technical story so I thought I would share it.
 
 
-------- story begins here ----------------
 
 
I returned 9 BTC to reddit user fitwear who recently claimed were stolen from their blockchain.info wallet.
 
I have evidence that some bitcoin address generation code in the wild is using private keys that can easily be discovered on a regular basis. This is either intentional or by mistake. Some wallets have been compromised by what is probably an innocent looking piece of code.  Furthermore, someone has been siphoning bitcoin on a regular basis since 2014 from them. Whether they discovered this by accident (like I did) or are the ones who installed the code themselves, I don't know.  It looks like either a clever exploit or a coding error. It could also be yet another piece of malware, however as I explain below, I feel this is less likely the case. In order to fully understand how this works and how I discovered it, please read on.
 
Some Background
 
I've been following bitcoin since I first heard of it in 2011. One of the things that fascinated me was the ability for someone to create private keys from just about anything using Sha256 (i.e. Sha256(password/phrase)).  This, of course, is NOT a recommended way of obtaining a private key since if YOU can think of the word/phrase, someone else can too and the likelihood of your bitcoins being stolen is quite high. The most secure private keys are generated randomly. The probability of someone else being able to generate the same sequence of 32 random bytes is so close to 0, it is highly improbable anyone ever will (given the expected lifespan of the universe).
 
If you peer into the blockchain, you will find that people have 'played' with the chain by sending small amounts of bitcoins to addresses corresponding to private keys generated using Sha256.  For example, Sha256 of each word in the entire /usr/dict/words file found on most UNIX systems has had a small amount sent to it.  There was a site called brainwallet.org that made it easy for you to convert a phrase into a private key + public address.  (The code is still available on GitHub but has since been removed from the Internet).  Try using phrases like "i find your lack of faith disturbing", "these aren't the droids you're looking for" or "satoshi nakamoto" as inputs to Sha256.  You'll find the addresses corresponding to those private keys have had small amounts sent to them (and transferred out).  It's quite obvious these were _meant_ to be found. It turns out there are a lot of these addresses. (Keep looking and you will easily find some.)  This is nothing new and has been known to the bitcoin community for a while.
 
I always had the idea in the back of my mind to try and find other non-trivial examples of 'discoverable' private keys.  That is, something beyond Sha256(word/phrase). So I decided to try and hunt for buried bitcoin treasure.  Perhaps I could find some bitcoin intentionally hidden by someone that hadn't yet been discovered?  In the first couple weeks of June 2017, I finally devoted some time to the task. I honestly didn't expect to find much but I was amazed at what I ended up discovering.  I began by writing a program to scan every block in the blockchain and record every public address that had ever been used.  (Note: I didn't only store addresses for which the balance was greather than zero, I stored ALL of them which is why I believe I ended up accidentally discovering what I did.)  There were only about 290 million at the time so this wasn't a big deal.
 
The Experiments
 
What follows is a description of my experiments and what led me to discover what I believe is either a scam or really bad coding error.
 
Experiment 1
 
My first experiment was to see if anyone used a block hash as a private key. That would actually be a nifty way to 'compress' 32 bytes in your head.  You would only have to remember the block height (which is only maybe 6 digits) and the corresponding larger 32 byte number would be saved for all time in the chain itself!
 
Results: Success! I found 46 addresses that had some amount of bitcoin sent to them between 2009 and 2016.  As expected, these all had 0 balances either because the owner had taken them back or they were discovered by someone else.
 
Here are two examples. You can use blockchain.info to see these hex values are actually block hashes from early in the chain.  This happened on/off up until mid-2016.

Nothing really alarming so far.
 
Experiment 2
 
Similar to my first experiment, I then searched for addresses that were generated from the merkle root used as a private key.  (BTW, I searched for both compressed/uncompressed keys, so each 32 bytes resulted in two address look-ups from my database).
 
Results: Yes! I found 6 addresses again up until mid-2016.  Even though every address I found had a 0 balance (again expected), I was having fun with my success!

Similar to merkle root and block hashes, transaction ids (hashes) also seem to have been used as private keys. Still nothing alarming to me thus far.
 
Experiment 3
I wondered at this point if anyone might have used repeated Sha256 on words.  Why stop at just one iteration when you can easily do one million?  Also, it becomes less likely to be discovered the more iterations you do.  I found a bunch.  Here are a few:
 
Sha256('sender') x 2
 
18aMGf2AxQ3YXyNv9sKxiHYCXcBJeJv9d1 098f6d68ce86adb2d8ba672a06227f7d177baca3568092e4cda159acca5eb0c7
 
Sha256('receiver') x 2
1C3m5mFx6SjBCpw6qLqzM8izZArVYQ9B5u 6681b4b6aa44318e55a724d7135ff23d76eb75847802cd7d220ecaa8427b91d4
 
Sha256('hello') x 4
 
17UZ4iVkmNvKF9K2GWrGyMykX2iuAYbe1X 28b47e9b141279ea00333890e3e3f20652bbd7abc2b66c62c5824d4d6fe50ac9
 
Sha256('hello') x 65536
 
1Mi5mVANRNAetbJ21u2hzs28qCJC19VcXY 52fa8b1d9fbb264d53e966809ce550c3ab033248498da5ac0c5ab314ab45198e
 
Sha256('password') x 1975 (This one's my favorite, someone's birth year?)
 
13mcYPDDktHdjdq9LwchhU5AqkRB1FD6JE 6e8cdae20bef63d33cb6d5f1c6c9c954f3148bfc88ef0aa1b51fd8b12fa9b41c
 
People were obviously burying bitcoin in the chain. Whether they expected the coins to be taken or not, we'll never know.  But these methods were still highly 'discoverable' in my opinion.
 
Experiment 4
 
My last experiment is the one that led me to believe someone was siphoning bitcoin from some service on a regular basis and has been since 2014.
 
Take a look at this private key:
 
    KyTxSACvHPPDWnuE9cVi86kDgs59UFyVwx2Y3LPpAs88TqEdCKvb
 
The public address is:
 
    13JNB8GtymAPaqAoxRZrN2EgmzZLCkbPsh
 
The raw bytes for the private key look like this:
 
    4300d94bef2ee84bd9d0781398fd96daf98e419e403adc41957fb679dfa1facd
 
Looks random enough. However, these bytes are actually sha256 of this public address!
 
    1LGUyTbp7nbqp8NQy2tkc3QEjy7CWwdAJj
 
I discovered this by performing Sha256 on all the public addresses I had collected from the setup of my experiments and then seeing if those addresses (from the generated private keys) were ever used.  Bingo!  Lots were coming up.  I searched a fraction of the chain and found dozens.  I also found these addresses had bitcoin sent to them very recently (within weeks/days of when I discovered them.)
 
I asked myself, "Why would someone do this?"
 
At first, I thought this was someone who thought they could get away with having to remember only one piece of information rather than two.  Maybe they have one favorite address/private key combo and derived another from that one?  I thought it was possible.  You could keep doing this in a chain and derive as many as you wanted and only ever have to remember the first one.  But I ruled this out for one simple reason; bitcoins transferred into those addresses were being transferred out within minutes or SECONDS. If someone generated these private keys for themselves, then why would the coins be almost immediately transferred out in every case I looked at?

A restaurant with quality meats and produce with staff paid decent wages.
I don't expect a 12 dollarydoo price tag for a standard "western meal" in Thailand, because it's shit quality and low paid staff and meals are generally much cheaper in Thailand on the whole, this is clearly overpriced for what you get in comparison to meal costs across the country

Here are some more (complete list at end of this doc):
 
16FKGvEtu5KPMZqiTK4yjmsSZsJLyxz9fr from Sha256(1CRWfJdgVrfKLRS4G3vTMRhEQrCZZyHNMo)
1HwxL1vutUc42ikh3RBnM4v2dVRHPTrTve from Sha256(1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH)
1FNF3xfTE53LVLQMvH6qteVqrNzwn2g2H8 from Sha256(1H21ndKEuMqZbeMMCqrYArCdV8WeicGehB)
 
In every case I looked at, the coins were moved away within minutes or seconds.
 
It was much more likely that a bot was waiting for those coins to show up. Also, transactions are STILL happening to this day on those addresses!  But how can that bot know in advance that address was about to receive bitcoins?
 
A Scam or a mistake?
 
It is at this point I formed a theory on what was really happening. It is likely that someone installed malicious code into the backend system of a mining pool, an exchange, or possibly wallet generation code. They are using public information so that they can discover the private keys easily and steal the coins on the side.
 
But why would they use Sha256(public_address)?  Why not do Sha256(public_address + some super hard to guess random sequence) or just use a hard-coded address?
 
Well, I have a theory on that too.  It can't be hard-coded or it would look suspicious in a source code repository.  It's likely the code was introduced by someone who works (or worked) for some company connected to bitcoin (exchange/mining pool/gambling site/wallet).  Code submitted by developers into source control systems usually goes through a code review process. It would be much easier to hide an innocent looking Sha256 operation inside the millions of lines of code that make up the backend.  Sha256 is used all over the place in bitcoin and it wouldn't look suspicious.  The function would be readily available.  However, if code were to be submitted that performed Sha256(address + "secret_password1234xyz"), that would look VERY suspicious.  My guess is someone has slipped in a routine that LOOKS harmless but is actually diverting bitcoin to their awaiting bot ready to gobble them up.
 
It's actually quite clever.  No one can know the destination address in advance.  You would have to keep performing Sha256 on all public addresses ever used to catch that one in a million transaction.  Someone would be able to capture those coins by simply watching for a transaction into an address that corresponds to a private key generated from Sha256 of one of the existing public addresses.  Keeping such a database is trivial and lookups are quick.
 
To be fair, I suppose this could be a coding error.  Anything is possible with a buffer overflow. I would love to see the code if this is ever found.
 
Transactions were STILL happening right up until a couple weeks before I made this discovery!  So I wrote a bot to try and 'catch' a transaction.
 
Mind Blown
Within the FIRST 48 HOURS of my bot going live, on Jun 19, a whopping 9.5 BTC was transferred into an address for which I had the private key.  This was approximately worth $23,000 USD at the time.  I was shocked.
 
This is the address: 12fcWddtXyxrnxUn6UdmqCbSaVsaYKvHQp
 
The private key is: KzfWTS3FvYWnSnWhncr6CwwfPmuHr1UFqgq6sFkGHf1zc49NirkC
 
whose raw bytes are derived from Sha256 of:
 
16SH69WgJCXYXWV58sxjTxonhgBh5HCZTt (which appears to be some random address previously used in the chain)
 
BUT... I had failed to test my program sufficiently and it failed to submit the transaction!  The 9.5 BTC was sitting there for almost 15 minutes before being swept away by someone else.  I honestly didn't think the first amount to cross my radar would be so high.  The other samples I found from past transactions were for tiny amounts.  It is quite possible that whoever moved them later out of the poisoned address actually owned them.  Maybe someone else's sweeper bot only takes small amounts most of the time to avoid attention?
 
At this point, I was pretty confident I was on to something not yet discovered by anyone else.  I _could_ have taken those 9.5 BTC and if this was known to others. Also, if you look into the history of that account, 12 BTC was transferred into it (and out right away) only one month earlier.  No one has claimed any theft (to my knowledge) involving that address.
 
I fixed my program (actually tested it properly this time) and let it run again.  My program detected more transactions (2 within the next 48 hours). I coded my bot to ignore anything less than .1 BTC so I didn't move them.  I didn't want to tip off the anyone that I knew what they were doing (if that was indeed the case).
 
Another 3-4 days passed and the next hit my bot detected was for roughly .03 BTC (~$95USD).  For some reason, this was not transferred out immediately like the rest.  By this time it was July 4th weekend.  I let this one sit too and it took a full 7 days before it was moved (not by me).  It may have been the legitimate owner or a bot.  We'll never know.
 
The destination address was: 1LUqqMzaigWJTzaP79oxsD6zKGifokrh7p
The private key raw bytes were: c193edeeb4e7fb5c3e01c3aebd2ec5ac13f349a5a78ca4112ab6a4cbf8e35404

I used bitcoin daily for the past week. Transactions cost $1.50-$2 for high speed confirmation and the coins are transferring within 25 minutes. If you're paying high fees and getting low transaction speed I recommend upgrading to a ledger nano s to give you more control over your fees as this is what I use and haven't had any delays or high fees to speak of

It helped me understand low time preference and it's a great hedge against the dollar that would make it a lot easier to exit the system if I needed to. Most people lend their money to the bank in the form of savings and when shit hits the fan these are the people who will get burned the most and be unable to extract their wealth.
In my country (Australia) banks can print their own money with no fractional reserve requirement, so the situation is pretty bad in it's current state and our inflation will only get worse. The dollars aren't backed by anything so I'm unsure how long the system will sustain for.

If you're storing your coins via blockchain.info or coinbase then you don't  own those coins. All you have is an IOU of bitcoin. 
They have the keys and therefore have all control over your bitcoin. To own bitcoin you need a hardware or cold storage wallet to  store them safely and to have control over your bitcoin.

Your maths is right, but the issue is market cap doesn't equal the amount of money invested into the market. The price could be manipulated to 10 million tomorrow if we all decided we wouldn't sell our bitcoin for anything less than 10 million.
Someone could buy 0.0001 worth of BTC at $10,000,000.00 at the new sell price and we now have a $10,000,000.00 BTC price with only a miniscule amount of volume.
Not sure if the analogy I'm presenting is 100% please correct me if I am wrong here

That link has no evidence whatsoever to show retail adoption is decreasing. The closest statement of information backing up their claim contradicts their claim:


Nowhere in this article does it provide any information to backup the article title to show retail adoption is getting lower. It mentions high transaction fees and the article is from July 2017 nothing about retail adoption. 
Can you point to the part of the article which links evidence that there is a decline in retail adoption?
The only piece of information that contains retail figures shows that bitcoin transactions are increasing for retailers who do use it:

I'm not specifically talking about any one kind of DEX, just the concept as a whole as described in my original post above I was being very general.
There's one hundred and one different types of DEX one person could run utilising many different blockchain initiatives, sadly I'm on a train right now so I can't write a detailed post on mobile, but some options are trustless exchanges via atomic swaps, aces technology and ED/Barterdex type exchanges depending on the supported coins and the speed of transactions required.
The overhead to run this exchange is far less than that of a centralised exchange and the fees to transact although dependant on the congestion of each chain, are lower than that of binance. The guy I was responding to is trying to say that if bitcoin has $40 transaction fees then a DEX can't work and can't be any better than binance, however it just means volume would not be high during this congested time. I can't predict the future of DEX's but they are making huge headway in 2018. You can even try some today and they are much cheaper to use than binance from my experience using them

What I described is exactly what a DEX would charge. Network fees cannot be more expensive than binance, for it it were, binance would be operating at a loss as binance still needs to send network transactions to facilitate withdrawals. A DEX is going to save you millions in overhead and staffing as none exists due to it being decentralised. A DEX doesn't pay miners I'm unsure if we're talking about the same concept here

Not only are they mining small blocks they are also being rewarded with MORE COINS for doing so. Check out the total circulating supply of bcash compared to bitcoin. More than 100,000 additional bcash have been mined since inception.
Could you imagine the damage this would do to bitcoin's coin circulation if we let miners be rewarded for mining empty blocks? We would be seen as a total joke! I can't believe how bcash HODLers can support this inflation on their coins supply

Could not find a single mention of the two words "bitcoin" and "monkeyrocket" together using google-fu or duck-duck-foo dated before the Intercept Article. I find it quite interesting that this was kept under wraps for this long, not even an obscure conspiracy style post anywhere to be found after all of these years (unless of course those mentions have been censored). 
You would think somebody would have let it slip, even if done so under the guise of parody.
The most concerning thing about this article for me was:


They manage to leak all of this information about the operation, yet could not tell the public which service was compromised. This service is likely still in operation today, hell the VPN I am using now could be compromised for all I know.
This article prompts more questions than it does provide answers

It's not referred to as core by anyone except bcash shills. Core is the name of the fucking client, not the name of the currency.
The currency is called Bitcoin so it's basically impossible to mistakenly call it something it is not called, unless done intentionally. 
Why would any company in their right mind change bitcoins name to bitcoin core when not referring to the bitcoin core client?

Fees for a DEX are based on network fees. If your fees are too high then the token you're trading has high network fees between the two trading pairs and has nothing to do with the exchange. If an open source DEX imposes added fees then nothing stops another developer relaunching that code with the added fees removed.

Cool, I haven't used their service prior to 2017, so I don't know if those problems are still prevalent. I loved it personally, the money went from my account to the exchange in 15 minutes.
I setup a NAB account separately and only transfer money to that account if I'm sending it to the exchange, so not really worried in any regard. I recommend you do the same thing if you're worried about the security aspect of it.

You get to pull it off once, now you're banned from that merchant for life.
Most thieves aren't going to have the technical aptitude to guarantee the double spend. Most thieves would find it easier to shoplift or use other less technical means for committing fraud.
If a merchant is using imperfect processes to guarantee bitcoin transactions then that naivity would not last long, for when they are burned once, twice or three times you would be guaranteed to see a change in that merchants processes. I agree it's less than perfect for merchants and maybe not ideal to use bitcoin in its current form, but with second layer solutions like LN this problem will be a thing of the past.

btcmarkets.net is the main exchange for large volume trading. They accept polipay which means if you have a supported bank, your AUD is credited within 20 minutes on most occasions.

That is true if you can plan days ahead and don't mind the missing gains, whilst the banks earn interest on your AUD in transit. 
An almost instant transfer to an exchange from the bank account is worth the convenience of a flat rate of over $3, in comparison to my funds being in transit sitting in the banking system for days, whilst I am losing potential crypto gains in the process.

That is a wiki link with every source quoting the same copy pasted article from 2012/14, using different websites to quote as a reference. **PoliPay is currently owned by Australia Post**
That link doesn't tell me anything new, when I check the sources to that Wiki article, it appears the claims it's making are misleading (i've removed the NZ banks because most were tweets from 2012). Can you please quote some more recent sources to backup the warning?:
"ANZ New Zealand,[20] Commonwealth Bank,[23] Westpac[24] are also warning customers against using POLi."
[20] ANZ: This source does not even mention Polipay, so why is it quoted in the Wiki? It is a warning to customers about entering your internet banking credentials into non-ANZ sites. 
[24] Westpac: The source used here is a blog post by payroll accounting software MYOB, not Westpac. The issue being: "POLi had apparently made changes to its service where they request internet banking details from users"
[23] Commonwealth bank: The same damn copy pasted article quoted as a reference in other references, this time from zdnet:
"The Commonwealth Bank does not have any working agreement with POLi Payments, and, as such, the payment site is not endorsed or supported by the bank. The bank urges customers making online payments to do so via the bank's own NetBank site, which guarantees the customer's security," CBA told ZDNet."
Have you got any sources from after the Australia Post acquisition?

Your point is valid, but it's not considering that there are plenty of use cases for USD. Crypto in general is a young space, so there is little incentive outside of the DarkNetMarkets to spend crypto. We haven't built the services to utilise normal crypto transactions but anyone watching this space can see a swath of innovation to build the services to provide the use case for crypto.
The ratio will eventually lean heavier towards normal transactions by normal people like it currently does with the USD. Come back in 2 years time and I don't believe the same argument can be said

I've got a big issue with their miners being rewarded for mining empty blocks. There is already an additional 100,000 bcash coins than bitcoin even though they process less transactions. This means they reward miners for doing no work on the chain.

Your argument relies off chain aka centralised exchanges being completely free to buy and trade coins, yet you list only one example: GDAX
As far as I am aware every single exchange charges a fee to buy or swap a  coin for another with the exception of GDAX. You're paying a trading fee to the exchange instead of to a miner is that really any better? That money could support the network instead of a corporation. 
List me the other exchanges where you can buy crypto without any fees? Pretend GDAX isn't accessible, what other examples have you got?
In regards to strain on the network for on chain trading, these coins exist to transact and for you to not use a crypto because you don't wanna congest the blockchain defeats the bloody point of it existing in the first place which is to be transacted on the network. If there is congestion then that is a good thing at this stage as it let's them address scaling issues early into the blockchain's life cycle instead of it being late in the cycle when there is potentially billions of dollars at stake or real world disruption. DEX platforms can only improve these systems in the long run 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:12:43


You could save a lot of time by contacting Coinbase directly and asking them. Your guess isn't representative of how a multi million dollar company operates. It's safe to assume you don't personally run one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world and don't have any experience to backup your guesses, which are lacking logic.
Edit: your post:  is referring to their old TOS, which have since been updated

Just a guess: If they did it in a small window then likely it would manipulate the bitcoin transaction fees to spike very high if they have a lot of hodlers trying to transfer all at once. Doing it over a large time window has a minimal impact to influence the bitcoin fee market
Secondly it helps to build hype
@_date: 2019-09-12 12:06:29
Funnily enough the same scare tactics were used against the internet in the late 90's/ early 2000's. Bitcoin is in a similar phase adoption wise and is a threat to a lot of the existing encumbants, which is why scare tactics are deployed against it.

Umm if the price is low, that means you should be checking it more, as it means you can now enter the market and get more out of your fiat conversions. If you only check prices during bull runs, it indicates you're buying at the top instead of at the bottom, I don't recommend this strategy for anybody.
You need to train your mind into looking at the benefits of the bear market instead of being upset by it. Everyone should try embracing it as a short term buying opportunity.
