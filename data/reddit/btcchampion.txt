Seek litigation if you do not get any resolution. 500K is not chump change.
EDIT- I do want to add that QuadrigaCX has been pretty good with their exchange so I am hoping this is just a one off issue. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:06:07
Yes what are you trying to say from that picture?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:03:53
On your point about Chinese mining, they are simply moving to different countries. They may be in Canada or Europe now but its still Bitmain running them and all their minions.
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:54:04
I think of it this way..
So think of how much electricity it costs to run the banks that handle debit/credit transactions, then what about all the employees driving to work using up gas which is even worse on the environment. That's just the start, you could figure out a huge number of items that could completely offset the electricity usage of Bitcoin.

Roger Ver has publicly lied on CNBC about Bitcoin and in numerous public interviews all while promoting his altcoin. 
The fact that  has gone from rarely posting to now posting nonstop about the altcoin while only posting negative stories about Bitcoin. Feel free to judge for yourself. 
Other layers I do not have enough knowledge with that to give you a good answer.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:54:59
Annnnnnd no Canada. I don't understand these companies decide to not release in Canada at the same time. Canada has a more open approach to Crypto yet they choose to start only in the U.S. Makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:26:32
This, when people go to Bitcoin right now there is huge confusion. Having them promote their altcoin as the real Bitcoin on national media is damaging.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:59:08
Thank you for the link.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:01:14
No, Roger had other people supporting him as well. Craig Wright, Jihan Wu to name the big ones, even possibly John McAfee. They all see an opportunity to mislead and trick new users into thinking their altcoin is better and that Bitcoin is failing.
While it is true there is no definitive proof, circumstantial evidence can be damming enough to prove a case. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck well it must be Roger Ver fucking that duck.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:15:03
LOL no I'm just saying that 500K of my life savings id be consulting any legal advice possible as that's not money to fuck around with. If it was even 10K I'd still not be OK with an exchange holding my money hostage.

If you had BTC in your wallet at the time of the fork back in August you would have gotten an equivalent amount of BCash. Sell it now while its high because its pretty much useless.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:34:44
AND exchanges properly implement Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:56
So Gemini would be good to buy BTC, after that Id move my BTC either Polo or Bittrex as they have a larger selection of Altcoins to play around with.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:11
BCash is just pumping right now because of the fact that they colluded with Coinbase to cause this pump. Literally out of nowhere they give out BCash with no announcement except saying before the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:04:32
I'm sorry but that's not ridiculous. You clearly have no knowledge about information security because if you did then you would also agree that the cloud is not a safe spot for very personal and sensitive information. I'd also never suggest someone to store their wallets or keys on a desktop computer either. That's even more irresponsible than storing it in the cloud. One also does not need to hack google, all they need to do is know your password which there is a plethora of ways to steal your password.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:04:13
Do NOT put it in the cloud. That's the worst place to put it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:25:12
If you wanted to pay higher fees you could however if you wish to wait then feel free. Don't lose more BTC than you need to over this shit. Fees WILL go back down once this crap has cleared. That's when you move your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:05

I can’t join you but I hope you get your BCash and sell it right away for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:18:39
Look at the timing, why did price start pumping HOURS ahead of their post? Yeah you're gonna sit their and tell me that there was nothing sketchy going on? Sure bud.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:02:06
The exact math I think varies but since the block height would be bigger it means that more transactions can fit within the block which in turn reduces the mempool. Sure I doubt it would bring it to zero but if everyone was using it like designed then we'd be seeing low fees and lower mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:19:34
BITCOIN also has the ability to transact with low fees providing that Roger Shithead and Jihan Fagwu stop spamming the mempool and exchanges properly implement Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:32
Yeah for real, out of nowhere they decide to give out BCH around the same time of BTC being spammed and BTC difficulty readjustment. How about implementing Segwit instead of fucking doing the work of the devil Coinbase or should I say CoinBCash

While I am not a fan of McAfee they did outline that the rules were to get the coins off the device. That didn’t happen so in my eyes it was not hacked.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:00
It will, while yes it may be slower right now it is this way because of companies like Coinbase who choose to not even implement an upgrade to BTC like Segwit but instead focus on implementing BCash which was forked by a guy with ZERO experience except that he is a millionaire...his words too not mine.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:52:04
All it takes is one hack, one leak of your password, one fuckup by xyz company hosting your cloud data. If you're serious about protecting your investments then do not store it on the same spot that other people have the ability to get to it.

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:42
When LN is fully implemented BCash will literally serve ZERO purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:19
I would however each country could be different.

@_date: 2018-09-17 03:03:29
Possible yes, difficult for sure but not impossible. 
Exchanges can easily use metadata to determine who is depositing from what addresses as one possible way.
@_date: 2018-09-01 13:05:11
No but they said in the context of the rules that hacked is that the coins need to be taken.  They did not say if you can install Doom on the device.

You could yep, but you can also do ETF from your bank to Quadriga if you get verified too so you wouldn't need Coinbase either. Once you have it you can transfer to any exchange you wish to buy other crypto if you so desire.

And what a surprise, people are selling. Or maybe it’s manipulation???!???
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:29:12
This is blatantly false, they have made ETH miners and a number of other ASICS for other coins. I don’t know where you got this idea that BITMAIN hasn’t made anything new.
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:07:30
Who knows but all I know is that this fucking “big bank” money and these “institutional investors” are ruining Bitcoin. Whoever really thought that big banks would not have an affect on the price is delirious. They are rich for a reason and it’s because they are good at gaming the market.
@_date: 2018-08-06 04:03:49
It is impossible to mine independently and find a block. The amount of ASIC devices running on the network is so high that there is zero chance for someone who wants to mine with their own equipment to ever be profitable. 
Sure pick a different mining pool however the problem is that BITMAIN owns all these ASIC devices that are generating the hashrate therefore collecting a large majority of the rewards and a large majority of power. 
You only have to look at when the BCash chain had that wild difficulty adjustment period and BTC miners jumped ship back and forth. Those were not normal miners, those were BITMAIN miners switching chains.
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:37:54
So are you trying to say I should by lots of Bitcoin Green?

@_date: 2018-08-05 21:41:12
Yeah and it gets further away from the normal person to be able to mine. Basically Bitcoin is becoming centralized to be mined by BITMAIN.
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:42:33
LOL is this guy smoking crack cocaine?
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:33:53
Fair point. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:43:48
This is bad news, the higher the difficulty the more BITMAIN controls. Why don’t people understand that. You think normal people have secret Bitcoin miners or have a GPU farm mining bitcoin and losing money? No it’s BITMAIN.
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:31:42

Wont somebody please think of the poor babies dying though!!!!
@_date: 2018-08-06 04:30:05
No what I am saying is that BITMAIN controls the ASIC hardware that has caused the hashrate of BTC to sky rocket. This means that now without ASIC equipment Bitcoin is becoming highly centralized and BITMAIN is in control.

You cant even buy any of Halong's miners right now and Bitmains miners accept only BCash not to mention the large number of people getting scammed or even used units that barely last a month. None of this makes a good case for ASIC. If people cannot buy the product then how is this good for decentralization?

“they have not successfully built a new chip since then. Bitmain’s tech is old and they are no doubt being beaten now in terms of efficiency by other manufacturers”
So again this is false, they have built new chips, they have made chips with ASICBoost, they have made chips for various other coins. You did not specify that they have made no more new BITCOIN miners but even if you did you would still be wrong!

@_date: 2017-11-13 14:23:45
No not spamming from Coinbase, but if the whole network was using SW then the mempool would not be where it was the past few days.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:20:15
Great this stupid clip again.
@_date: 2019-02-02 15:29:04
Cool, whose the next person to post this for the 400th time today?
@_date: 2019-02-22 03:53:09
Coming from the guy who did insider trading when BCH was released? Fuck you Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-02-22 12:29:29
Yeah there was lots of proof, before it was even listed the price of BCH was slowly going up for no reason. 
Then there was a user who found a 4chan post that was posting saying BCH would be listed on Coinbase soon.
When there are a lot of coincidences from all angles it’s clear proof that they knew what was going on and they performed insider trading.
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:06:16
But these are not the words he said.
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:04:59
My reply would be “Go fuck yourself”
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:22:44
The problem isnt JUST fees. It also helps to take the signatures out of the block allowing more to be processed. Bigger 'blocks' without literally making them bigger. A smart way to scale BTC, not making 512 MB block sizes like Bitcoin Shit, sorry Cash.
@_date: 2019-02-18 02:52:14
You should be removed you fuck. Something that will help Bitcoin and you people get pissed off.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:35:19
I don't think you read my comment properly. Never did I use Trump to make an argument. If you had any intelligence then you would realize that what I am implying is that the same people who would think that Donald Trump is a good choice as president are the same people who are blindly following the BCH shills when they are clearly manipulating the market. Hence why I said that they have no logical thinking to understand what is going on with BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:14:56
Cold storage wont matter much if there not moving it. Priority should be exchanges which transfer BTC in and out.
@_date: 2019-12-12 04:20:20
Cant control a product people refuse to use. There is nothing preventing me from mining a forked chain that isn’t controlled by governments or private industries. I will continue to set my miners on the chain which is truly decentralized.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:12:05
How did you buy it?
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:49:58
Honestly the amount of people spreading false information and not even understanding whats happening with Bitcoin is off the fucking chart. I feel as if all the people who think BCH is better than BTC are the same type of people who voted for Donald Trump, they are not able to comprehend any type of logic whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:13:47
Good to hear! Spread the word.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:20:42
It's easy to say when unfortunately Coinbase is one of the easiest ways to buy BTC/ETH/LTC.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:11:50
Its impossible to argue with someone who is illogical, voted for Trump and is a BCH supporter. So all in all, learn to argue better.
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:38:38
People actually watch this garbage?
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:08:47
I appreciate you actually pushing adoption forward and not having exchanges control your money.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:48:00
Or flag .com as irrelevant. If enough do it the rating should decrease.
@_date: 2019-12-10 04:34:22
Pretty sure there was an article showing Coinbase as the biggest wallet of BTC besides Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:19:53
This is one part yes, an excuse to keep pushing big blocks-high fees, they do NOT have their best interest in Bitcoin otherwise they would have implemented SW on day one.
@_date: 2019-12-09 17:38:53
Word of advice, don’t listen to 99.9% of these bullshit articles.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:01:25
I can sell it to you.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:22:16
There is a reason, they were both duped by a scammer. Don't worry, I understand why you are upset since you must have voted for Trump and also lost some BTC buying BCH then watched it crash as VER took all your money.
@_date: 2019-12-12 13:43:19
I don’t think you truly understand how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:23:54
I wasn’t joking, I have enough if you were interested.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:41:10
Oh I would never suggest doing it outside the web. There are other ways but good on you for knowing the risks.
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:35:05
1%? What things are you just pulling out of your ass?
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:20:09
Sorry but your repetition of my statement does not hold true, nice try. 
MtGox had ZERO insurance nor legal framework to follow. Coinbase is the complete opposite.
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:10:27
I agree with this 100%. As much as I don’t like CoinBase they are probably the safest place to store coins from an exchange perspective.
@_date: 2019-12-07 23:00:14
Every day should be Proof of Keys day.

No different then terrorists holding people hostage for USD. So what’s your point?
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:44:24
All this has proved out of these hash wars is that ASIC mining has ruined BTC. If we ever want to be taken seriously we can’t have ASIC monopolies mining in where they can wipe out 15-20% in a few days by switching chains.....the simple truth.
@_date: 2018-11-17 06:01:24
They sell BTC for BCH, get both coins when they fork, buy back in BTC at lower prices and hope that these two shitcoins make them money.
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:13:29
Stop with this bullshit.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:06:06
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:44:12
I agree, a stroke of pure genius in this artistry.
@_date: 2018-03-28 11:52:21
This is why I don’t understand why people were happy about Wall St coming into Bitcoin. Do they not understand there sole job is to find ways to cheat systems and make money!?? 
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:34:29
It’s a scam.

That man has the most punchable face ever.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:05:27
Exactly, they don’t give a shit about Bitcoin succeeding or not. They are more than happy to walk away with more money than they had before and letting it die.
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:10:08
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:01:47
I vote to rename the title of this to “Satoshi, while paralyzed by ALS, wrote code for a bitcoin wallet using only his eyes”.

Great repost for the 500th time.

I think he is on more than just Benzos ...
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:29:29
I only agree with 100% of your statement 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:45:19
LOL why you posting this here, you got scammed because you went to a non official site and downloaded a wallet. Good grief.....
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:03:10
Well he has millions more than you so his opinion must be the correct one right? /s

Three people trying to swing their tiny dicks around, Roger Ver/Jihan Wu and Craig Wright.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:51:58
Don’t do it, it will take way too long to break even. Not only that but fuck Bitmain and fuck Jihan Wu.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:13:12
Listen, if you buy now in a few years you will be better off than you were today. Don't think you are going to make millions as those days are over. Just buy what you can afford and hold as an investment. 5-10 years from now you will thank yourself.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:18:38
Don't invest money you cant afford to lose. This applies to Bitcoin as well so invest wisely.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:26:44
You cant compare it then using 21 M shares, that's not how this works. You cannot say that these are what the market caps would be if they had 21 M shares because it would be a totally different story.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:44:28
Some countries have limited options, in Canada most reputable places charge more than Coinbase, plus even with the fees its cheaper than our banks fees for other transfers, oh and Bonus Aeroplan points while im at it too.

Wait a bit and if Bitfinex doesn't credit your account then put in a support ticket. And for future reference be more careful, one wrong step and your money can be gone.

Yes, what made you decide $2850. Well guess what, I predict it will go to $4.2 trillion in the next 39 days. Trust me.

Hal Finney, it is the only logical person at this point. He passed away, coins have never moved from the wallet.

Ohhhhmyyyygoddd can we stop posting this at every $100 rise FFS!
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:52:52
Yeahhhh no thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:04:50
It doesn't really mean anything nor does it make sense comparing these. Comparing Apples to Oranges here.
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:00:15
Credit cards have reversals, credit cards can also have MANY layers of verification to prevent scams and fraud transactions. Your point is not valid.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:58:24
Not possible for Canadians to do, not sure about other countries.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:14:14
For BTC to become mainstream grandparents need to be able to use it without being scammed or tricked.  Otherwise what’s the point of getting BTC adoption up if normal people can’t use it.
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:16:20
And that same day I was wondering if I should by more, just like I’m doing today. 
Good thing I bought more then and today.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:26:04
One word, Tether.
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:39:59
I agree...
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:38:56
Reset then try to recover. Don't be lazy about securing your coins. Otherwise go back to keeping your fiat in the bank.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:49:35
Seriously? Article is behind a paywall, fuck that shit. But fuck Coinbase even more.
@_date: 2018-07-13 11:59:07
Or maybe he is Satoshi? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:49:24
I'm making my prediction again... Bitcoin will hit 4.2 Trillion in 7 months. I have no reason as to why, but you should just trust me.
@_date: 2019-09-27 20:47:59
I’m saying the fake printing of Tether is what is causing the problems with the Bitcoin markets.
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:48:39
Please explain or show proof that Coinbase doesn't accept Canadians anymore. I literally bought today with zero issues.
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:07:22
That site still exists!!?? I guess my ad blocker really has been working.
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:17:06
Yeah except Roger Ver has made it his mission to confuse the fuck out of people so there’s that. You think your grandma is gonna research the difference ? No she ain’t.
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:50:07
What are your personal thoughts on Roger Ver and his scam crew?
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:30:58
Not sure but it is super fishy.
@_date: 2019-02-03 17:02:44
Omg not again, fucking Chinese New Year, Wall Street bonuses, Institutional money. Can we please start banning these piece of shit posts!!!!
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:06:43
I don't think it does at all. The problem is that Roger Ver knows nothing about the technical aspects of Bitcoin. He simply invested money and got rich from it. Samson even without full technical knowledge talked in a professional manner and schooled Roger while he used his same points he uses time and time again that have no relevance to the argument being presented.
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:31:56
No it hasn’t though.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:17:33
I’m glad that you can see through his nonsense.
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:08:42
You realize that this is Satoshi himself who said this right? They keep saying Satoshis vision this, Satoshis vision that, so how is this a fail bud?
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:55:34
Rick and Morty, Mr Meeseeks
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:19:22
No it doesn’t.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:54:44
Every time Roger talks I just want to punch him in the face. The amount of shit he spews out is so ridiculous. How does anyone take him seriously?
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:58:19
I hope he wins and gets the biggest possible payout.
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:48:01
Omg shut the fuck up and go buy BCash then
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:51:55
Mark Cuban is also equally useless.
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:47:10
Yeah except I wouldn’t take Bitcoin advice from any of these people. I saw these and kept thinking to myself that none of these people could probably even explain what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:03:06
Dam it’s been a while since I’ve seen a good ol fashioned Hate Poloniex thread!
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:57:54
LOL Jesus Christ.
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:03:33
I like your reply, excellent rebuttal.
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:56:03
Can we stop with these articles. Every fucking different person/bank has an opinion and throws out some random number of what BTC will hit. GUESS WHAT not all of them will be correct so why even post this shit. 
Here's my prediction, Bank Of Me: Bitcoin will cost $4.3 million in 2018.
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:42:18
No the post is about how Bcashers blindly follow this so called “Satoshis Vision”
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:43:53
Price has dropped almost $100 since 5 minutes ago.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:02:00
I agree with you, the same thing happened when SegWit was locked in, if it wasn't for all the FUD around this stupid new ShitCoin the price would have still been retreating and we were on the path to losing any gains we made from the SegWit lock-in.
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:10:33
BUT BUT if you have bigger blocks then it will save even more babies!!!
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:41:25
I use QuadrigaCX, however once you buy move them off their site. They have low trade volume so there are some scam bots making huge buy/sell walls.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:52:15
The article mentions nothing about Elastos.
@_date: 2017-07-24 02:19:53
You still haven't made a point? Please, go ahead.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:39:41
Fair enough, good luck down under! 
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:51:01
Shooting back up ;)
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:52:24
Not to a Canadian bank account unfortunately, you can buy but not sell for some reason.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:30:23
No, wait for the fork, get your Bitcoin ScamCoin and then sell that to buy more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:49:04
Because of the low volume their screwing with the prices. Try placing an order lower/higher than them and you get outbid. Scummy people using their coins abusively to fuck with the price. You cant do proper trades on that site.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:10:39
3G's baby
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:56:29
You have to watch for hours to time it perfectly if you expect to beat those bots trading.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:06:34
I've used them and have sent Wire Payments twice without issue. However, I have not used PayPal so I cant say how well it works. So far my only issues with QuadrigaCX is the higher markups and the bots causing problems due to low trading volume. But with QCX and move off if you want to do trading.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:51:28
Well your name is very fitting, your stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:49:32
You cant sell on Coinbase only buy.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:42:26
I'll tumble them for you.
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:02:31
This, it IS controlled by the rich already. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:11:41
What? I hold BTC but id never buy from an ATM with huge markups. Its called being smart.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:19:14
What does this mean
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:33:23
They may be paying but simple math proves you wont make your money back.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:54:07
LOL, there asking 3801 CAD while QuadrogaCX is buying at 3550. No thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:39:20
Won't break 3000, guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:43:00
Can you send me your private key?
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:06:58
Why is he a douche? He is one of the most sane and logically people currently in our lifetime. You must be one of those who don’t agree with logic and are trying to suppress free speech with your social justice warrior friends.

Great video clip to choose, this was heavily edited by Vice. Maybe do your research before posting random clips.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:33:10
Yes because again you assume people are uneducated just because they would listen to what Jordan Peterson has to say. Grow up, explore the world because you don’t know shit about shit.
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:32:12
Yeah it’s some whiney bitch complaining about entirely untrue things along with him making straw man arguments. Grow up and learn to understand the world around you instead of listening to some random guy on YouTube.
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:33:49
In other news, I don’t give two shits about what the SEC says. Fuck America.
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:30:45
Oh really ? Very interesting to hear these words because everything you just said is entirely untrue. Again people like you are the same people who probably think it’s ok for logic to be thrown out the window in favour of irrational thinking.
