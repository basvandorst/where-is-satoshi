lol   I have received a dozen inquiries about bitcoin since Monday. These are from the same ppl who were not inquiring a year ago when it hadn't hit 1K yet.  
 I had to correct someone who kept calling it Bitcurrency while reminding them that the USA doesn't consider it a "currency"  But we all know that is gonna change real soon.

Yeah, I panicked sold 2 back in April when it dropped 30% in 4 hours.  I regret that.  Thanks  for being cool and not judging. I'm actually buying some btc right now.  It's kind of a steal at 3500

I wish I had $1750 in cash to give her.  
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:31:11
if I only had $1750 cash, I would have.

I wish I could buy it off her but I  can't. My main concern which I did not mention in the original post is that it's coming from my coinbase account and to my bank account that is involved.  I just don't want to get screwed by the IRS,

I would IF I had that much cash on hand, which I do not.

I was being sarcastic, but also wished she didnt sell.  Im not charging her any fees.

that is also true

truth...its an amazing time in history. I remember 6 months ago I got pissed when it fell from $1170 to $930 in 24 hours, so I sold 2 of them.  I lose more $ everyday, but that lesson taught me well.   I will never do something as silly as that again.   let's hit $5000 by months end...the  dip back down again.

Thanks for your supoort. She's 77 and starting to become a bit senile. She believes whatever she reads online so with the China news and the JP Morgan "statement" she panicked.  At least I made her some $$.

Thank you for all the messages. Obviously I did NOT charge her a fee even though I disagreed with her decision because yes, she is a great woman and birthed me etc etc.  I was never going to charge her, which is why I included "slight sarcasm" in the title. However when btc rebounds in a few weeks, I will do my best to bite my tongue and not say "told you so."
