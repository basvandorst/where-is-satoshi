Oh yeah. The floor on this rally is made up of new investors and possibly a bunch of pump and dump whales. When shorts come out and this drops to 12-14k you think we won't see panic selling and profit taking?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:47:12
What everyone is failing to mention is that this price is being driven by a brand new surge of demand from people who know nothing about Bitcoin. The amount of people I've personally seen who know nothing about it that suddenly talk about it is surging. Look at the amount of new users here. Look at how many new users signed to coinbase.
Normally I would say this huge surge would be awesome. However, when it drives the prices like this it creates a floor of these new investors that don't know Bitcoin. With futures coming out shorting seems like the perfect play. The minute people start dumping I'm scared to see how these new investors react. It could scare most of them to sell.

It's not a wall street thing though.
I'm talking just whales/community in general. You buy up a huge amount of bitcoin with all the new adapters coming in it flies up between 10-16k per.
Then when the ability to short comes out you have amassed a ton of bitcoin in the 10-16k price range. Enough that selling at 12-15k is PLENTY of gains by itself. 
Now add in the fact that you can short bitcoin. And you know lot of people will be doing that.
You hold a ton of bitcoin so you start selling for profit. It drops from 16k-14k.....then 13k....then 12k..... Uh oh shorts are looking good here.
If this drops to $10k in a day or two you are going to see panic selling from the early adapters. This could drive the price below $10k.
Which is more than enough to take profit from shorting. You make money on the way up and on the way down.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:43
the amount of new money in this is exciting and scary. I'm upset I sold early but I'm also glad I'm out.
NO idea when this will come crashing down but I REALLY feel that this is setting up to get HEAVILY shorted soon.

same. I jumped over to Ripple since it has a real use case. It's not a fancy coin so it doesnt have the hype trains like bitcoin and etherum. Would love to get back into bitcoin but my target now is $10k.

God. I remember seeing Bitcoin on the tor network and thinking how interesting the concept was. I figured... well I don't need to buy drugs, hitmen, child porn or various other dark market shit so I have no need for this currency.
Sigh I thought its main purpose was the anonymous deep web transactions. Guess I was wrong haha.

You could get paid in Bitcoin if your employer wanted to. Just like you could get paid in Yen or Euro etc. However, I bet your employer only pays you in American dollars. That doesn't make the other currencies a commodity.
Could you take $1 million US dollars and sell it all at once for another currency? Of course just like you can with Bitcoin. It's just currency trading.

If bitcoin algorithms don't give a shit about a major city using Bitcoin then it wouldn't give a shit if any major cities used Bitcoin?

You don't think having one of the largest cities in the world with a barrier for entry to bitcoin hurts the currency? 
If I told you that NYC stopped accepting VISA almost entirely, you don't think that would hurt VISA? 
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:45:32
Honestly if you are too dumb or blinded to think that this doesn't hurt bitcoin then it's not worth arguing with you since you won't listen to logic. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:22:05
NYC is one of the largest cities in the world. You can't deny that. You also can't deny my previous statement about VISA or another simalar company. Stop pretending this doesn't suck for bitcoin. 
You know what else NYC has? A fantastic labor pool of smart people. Smart people who now won't be working for Bitcoin start ups. That is another reason this sucks for bitcoin. 
Everyone needs to take off their rainbow puppy sunglasses and realize Bitcoin isn't always $100% good news and nothing ever goes wrong for it.

"by going to any local branch of the sellers bank and filling out a deposit form with cash, "
IMO that's everything I don't want to do with bitcoin. When step 2 is go to your local bank you've lost me.
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:58:49
Can we be honest with ourselves for once and realize this hurts BOTH parties.
Will this affect NY's economy or peoples standard of living? Absolutely not.
Will this hurt bitcoin start ups and the availability to spread bitcoin to the LARGEST city in America? Yes absolutely it will.
If you assume Bitcoin will grow and grow NY misses out on a future where start ups and companies are HQ'ed in NY or where people have easy access to this market.
Short term this hurts Bitcoin more IMO.

Thanks to this I just went down the rabbit hole of this escort back page business. It's nuts they have review sites for escorts and it's just crazy to think about it.
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:16:52
The problem is you have a community that is split.
You have people who HODL and want Bitcoin or see Bitcoin as a store of value like gold.
Then you have the people who think Bitcoin should be replacing Fiat in transactions. They want to use Bitcoin like Fiat/PayPal/visa etc.
Meanwhile the technology behind Bitcoin isn't really being developed or upgraded for either purpose specifically.
That leads to Bitcoin sitting in purgatory waiting for a purpose.
Without a purpose there will be NO mass adoption.
Who wants to buy something when they don't know what it's even for?
The hype is why people bought it previously, they didn't care about use case. Now people care about a use case and Bitcoin doesn't have an answer yet.

Whoa firesale what's going on 
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:48:25
Ur going to see pull back still. We had a huge run up, a big pull back then a bounce. I thought this would settle at $3k but it seems to keep bouncing at $3.5k where there is some resistance now. I originally thought we'd see it drop to $2.5-$2k before we bounced and met resistance. I wouldn't be surprised if we level here for a bit or even fall again. It's nothing to worry about if you can hodl for a while.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:24:20
Because I believe Bitcoin will fail if it doesn't pick one and do well at it. It's not a false choice to say that Bitcoin needs to be a gold or a dollar. Normal investors and people of the street need to understand what it's used for. The technology behind it needs to work well. For both of those to happen I believe it needs a single vision.
Also right now the whole crypto market is tied to Bitcoin and Bitcoin price. At some point Bitcoin won't be the market mover. People will stop caring what Bitcoin price is and the price of coins will fluctuate based on their use and popularity. Everything now is all speculation. Normal people will grow tired if the Bitcoin hype that goes nowhere. They will invest in coins they see as useful and practical. The de-coupling of Bitcoin and other alt coins will be a huge deal.
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:07:50
Haha I see what ur getting at.
If community consensus was "store of value" let's use BTC to back shit, investments, larger transactions with ok time I think it be more successful.
When you have half the community trying to fight for better transactional tech and the other half not caring about that it only drags the crypto down.
Which leads to what you are implying and I sorta agree with.
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:33:49
And people will disagree but I honestly think that for Bitcoin to actually succeed it needs to pick one. Currency or store of value. I'm not sure it can survive as both. 
It needs to be really good at one of those things. It needs to market itself as one of those things. If it's sorta kinda both people will always be hesitant to adapt.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:42:25
Now that I've sold all my bitcoin I've become more interested in the growth of the currency than the up or down of the price. It has been a really new perspective for me seeing Bitcoin growing as a currency and becoming more and more legit.
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:03:12
Bitcoin has historically been terrible with transaction times. Buying .0002  btc worth of goods just doesn't seem to be feasible/workable (there is a better word I'm just drawing a blank here).
I think being a transactional currency that turns into a store of value sounds great I just don't see btc set up for that right now.
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:35:42
You're not wrong. I mean more specifically that the consensus isn't one use. Everyone isn't all aboard the store of value train.

Honestly they are probably one of the easiest sites for someone to get into buying some btc or eth. For the most part I've had no problems with them for that. During times like this where there is volatility the site almost always seems to go down.
When I went to sell my eth at $280 it wasn't working. Price is at $265 right now and still can't sell. You can see why that would be a big deal. Now people are stuck to possibly selling at a lose or just holding hoping for a bounce etc.
Just don't keep the coins in coinbase you aren't willing to lose or need to move quickly and you are fine.
