The more it furthers away from being a currency and more into a "store of value" the faster some other crypto will probably replace it?

USD dude... not even a question

Thanks, i'll check these out.

no idea honestly, logically everyone and their mothers should adapt  asap for the greater good, but not everyone is always logical. so i can't really think of a reason. but as the other kind posters below have said, maybe it will get adopted fairly quickly and easily.

You seem informed, why do you say Roger is a nefarious actor?
What proof are there that the bitcoin tw account was hijacked by "shills"?
Also i'm curious about LN, what are the other "layers" after it's deployed that will guaranteed to solve the scaling problem?
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:01:30
as long as it's a """Store of value""" it's closer to a ponzi scheme than a currency
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:48:35
do you think if the fork had been orchestrated by someone else other than Rogers his project would've been better?
Also yeah the activity seems weird, altho there are a few posts back on aug 2017 about bcash, the account has surely become way more active and partial on what they post. interesting
Edit: this is not definitive proof, although suspicious it could've been a change of heart as the allegedly owner said.

Can't blame them, btc cannot be used effectively as a currency at the moment, i really hope that we get something in the next few months to solve this issue

i got this link yesterday from a kind poster, this is Roger Vers, and r/btc afaik isn't Roger Vers. Also it isn't always 100% BHC altho honestly it's around 80% "we hate r/bitcoin" basically. 
on the other side this sub is 80% "we stroke our own ego with memes" 
anyway if you have any link of disinfo they're spreading or if they're scaming, please SHARE it, so other people can be aware of it, assuming it exists otherwise, yes, you'll have to learn to share the internet

how were the fee prices back then?

Can we ban the kids that ask for banning kids? O:
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:54:21
you cant have any of that before it solves the issues on fees, lets not put the car before the horse
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:00:43
scamming and misleading? example?

Did he really invest around 1 billion in marketing? dam

It's neither fast nor has low fees. So this is being honest i guess?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:50:37
so the higher the fees the better for BTC right? :D
Personally the only reason i still have BTC is because i mostly do in-exchanger trades so the fees rarely hit me. However when they do it fucking sucks,if it weren't because BTC is the most widely adopted coin atm i would have passed mine into something else already. If the coin cant solve this problem it's most likely fated to be replaced by something that can, hopefully i'll be able to get out before it happens.

nobody knows, assuming fees keep raising people might change to a different altcoin altogether before LN hits, people have been saying for a few years now that LN will be deployed in "1-2 years". I think even if it gets deployed in time, the success rate depends on whether it gets adopted massively by the main exchangers and such. imo
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:30:20
Aren't fees to high to be plausible to use as currency anyway?
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:19:18
fake or not, you gotta admit they are doing an excellent job on promoting their coin, and masses usually care about short term results, rather than looking at the long game.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:20:44
probably because there's none?
