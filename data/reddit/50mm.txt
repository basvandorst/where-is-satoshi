I hope you're right.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:38:53
Ah. Checked your comment history. Nice M.O. - you must love that the internet gives you free reign to be a prick.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:33:11
Wasn't looking for sympathy. Have fun being an ass on the internet.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:33:03
Ok, cool, thanks. I had set up a BitFloor account, so I will give the deposit to localtill a shot and look into dwolla for the future.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:32:29
What's your plan at this point?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:17:11
Yes. I've done alright today playing with my little $500. Hoping to get back in tonight when mtgox opens back up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:42:01
it's been working for me. a little downtime about 40 minutes ago. back now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:46:00
Yeah, up and down. Obviously still struggling with DDOS. Sucks, but at this point I haven't lost anything. Was excited about the prospect of potentially picking up coins on the cheap, though.

Create a bitfloor.com account, use the deposit form there which will give you a localtill deposit account. Take that paper to BoA and deposit cash + localtill fee. Go back home and see that cash in your bitfloor account. Use that cash to buy BTC.

Ah, I got you. I go through this with a rowdy 5 year old, too. Social etiquette.
So a nice way to say what you wanted to say would have been, "You know, I believe that trading BTC as a commodity rather than using it as a currency is bad for BTC. I strongly believe in BTC, so it upsets me to see people doing this."
A simple rewording and a little more tact would prevent people from taking an immediate dislike to you.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:36:34
OK, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:54:48
That's what I've been using. Quick and easy.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:38:41
Maybe stay the same for a bit. Then one yours. Probably not, though.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:35:34
Up now. Considering buying coins and transferring into another exchange that isn't being hit so hard.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:22:38
Solidarity! Good luck! Sure would be nice to buy back in at $30 after selling @ $120 today. Even nicer if it went back to $120 tomorrow for another DDOS rollercoaster.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:13:40
If and when bitfloor comes back, just use their interface to send your btc to your blockchain.info wallet. Easy peasy. Protip: If you want to see it @ blockchain quicker, use the advanced send to add a miner fee.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:29:32
Maybe. :)
Then again, maybe not.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:03:42
After a couple of mistakes last night, I wound up with 1.5 more bitcoin than I started with. So, I'm down USD, up BTC. Learned a little, though.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:46:40
Look her in the eye, tell her you're sorry, that you had the best intentions, that you love her and that you'll get through this.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:50:24
just up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:22:11
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:09:42
Yes, it's possible. Most exchanges have an api.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:18:12
Just today. Through bitfloor until they got DDOS'd. First time trying it myself - watched in fascination all day yesterday. Saw the same thing happening today, so I sold @ $150, bought  sold again  bought  and sold again  It was fun, but likely would've been a lot less fun with $20k that I couldn't afford to lose.

Use the deposit form on bitfloor.com. It will give you a localtill deposit account. Print it and take that paper to BoA and deposit cash + localtill fee. Go back home and see that cash in your bitfloor account. Use that cash to buy BTC.

Dealing with DDOS according to their twitter stream.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:57:30
cool, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:39:47
My guess is sell high, buy low, but I'll let him answer.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:15:05
yes. up and down after the 52 -&gt; 77 spike. boo.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:25:03
Considering all of my funds are there, I agree. They have another 3.5 hours to get ready.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:26:50
Mtgox is down for trading until 10 est tonight.
