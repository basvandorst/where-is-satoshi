You want to do something about it, DEMAND that "regulation" be turned into a helpful thing where they are concerned with cold storage, 2FA and other best practices and not some scheme to control the flow of value.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:53:00
Such a dumbass.  I'm AGAINST regulation.  The point is, they are doing it anyway.  You can't just stick your fucking head in the sand.  If you do, you get what you deserve.  I suggest you point out that what they are calling regulation is NOT THAT AT ALL.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:04:42
They already do.  They're called banks.  This free market free-for-all left us with the biggest monopoly on earth in money.  Maybe things aren't as simple as choosing an ideology and sticking to it come hell or high water?
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:13:35
I HATE posts like this.  They seem so desperate.

Are the exchanges fully functioning yet...Gox, BitStamp?  I think they need to do press announcements saying the community has come together and fixed the issue.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:59:52
Hahahaha!  This is anti thinking for yourself.  You can't just embrace another ideology and claim you're thinking for yourself.  You've just chosen another cult.

Leave your wallet in your home with the doors open and constantly put out signs saying "My Money's In Here.  Come and get it!"
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:25:30
Guys THIS is a good idea.  We should replicate this.  Perhaps have a list that people sign to show other businesses in the area.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:54:54
I agree with you partially. I don't personally believe any one ideology is correct.  However, they are going to "regulate" anyhow.  We should keep the focus on what regulation should be.  
In my opinion, right now, they are not regulating but rather trying to slow the flow of value into bitcoin.  I don't think they should call themselves regulators if they don't learn the technology and attempt to ensure exchanges  abide by industry agreed upon standards..
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:42:50
I've seen NO press releases that weren't dishonest and an outright attempt at FUD.
Sometimes wrong but strong works unfortunately.  We need a right and strong voice to counter it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:24:26
Yes, let's just keep voting Mt. Gox related posts to the top and keep it in the news cycle forever so other more positive stories can't get exposure.
GREAT JOB @_date: 2014-02-16 20:50:37
The point is to point to their behavior.  With enough fingers in their face, it will slow down their plans.
I think you need to stop being a pathetic defeatist.
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:36:20
It's time to fight these laws.  It's time to get legislation removing these laws from the books.  These are clearly monopolistic laws put in place to legally and tyrannically eliminate competition from the financial services sector--the largest, most corrupt monopoly in the world.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:19:57
Oh shut up.  I'm so sick of these snarky, self serving posts.
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:21:02
I would be all for REAL regulation.  Current regulation has nothing to do with making it safer for folks using exchanges.  It's all about slowing the flow of big money into bitcoin.
If they want to "regulate" then they should learn and enforce the best practices to avoid hacking, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:38:57
I think most folks asking this here are trolls.  Who cares what your views are on bitcoin markets.  Go to and ask.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:51:37
They are about to defraud a ton of folks out of fiat and bitcoin.  Also best practices regulation could have avoided their headaches.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:51:48
So edgy.  This post screams, "In my attempt to not be a follower, I have adopted the ideology of another group and will follow that.  Take that world!"
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:48:48
Many media outlets are spreading absolute lies and FUD.  It creates a false impression.  There is no counter to it at this point.  
Perhaps though, it may be best just to remain silent and let the truth shine through over time.  People are such followers though if no one stands up to people telling lies, a lot of people will just believe it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:31:33
You don't have to wait on confirmations--especially for such small ticket items.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:22:10
It's not that regulation will help.  It's that we are being forced to comply with regulation to open an exchange in the US so we have to say we love regulation.
YAYYY...WE LOVE REGULATION!!
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:02:07
You guys keep screaming, "we don't need no stinking regulation!"  Keep burying your head in the sand as BitLicenses, etc are forced upon people.  You can't make something go away by hating it.  At least you can shine a spotlight on how what they are really doing is NOT regulation.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:29:41
Well we don't know where the bottom is and we know it's here to stay.  It's always best to buy low and sell high so unless you think bitcoin is fundamentally flawed or just won't make it maybe now is the best time to buy.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:30:59
No, it hasn't.  People are just too lazy to make the distinction.  If it says bitcoin, everything it touches must be perfect for the core to be great for some reason.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:56:04
I do.  I don't belong to any ideology.  You have to have rules, you have to have law.  You should just try to attain the correct amount that benefits the most people.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:51:44
No goober, your libertarianism is a cult.  It doesn't always JUST work.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:21:53
Is it better to get in something when it is at a low or at a high?  If we get a wave of good news in the coming months, which will likely be the case once a lot of the wealthy get their beaks wet with bitcoin and are ready to promote it, folks will wish they'd gotten in during the lows. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:35:15
They have been publicly exploring bitcoin options.  It really wouldn't surprise me if they led the way here.  It would be VERY smart.
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:40:56
This guy definitely has his eyes completely closed.  I would suggest he use bitcoin and see what the fuss is all about.  
The biggest advantage for me is instantly transferring value.  I tried moving money between banks a few months ago and it literally took 3 days.  Why?
Once bitcoin is at the point where you don't need to exchange it, it's instant.  You simply can't do that with the US dollar.
Also, most currencies are designed to go down in value.  The US dollar is actually decent at this but still terrible.  You have a few people at the top (literally a few) creating new money enriching themselves and weakening everyone else's money.  This is just morally wrong no matter who you are.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:12:24
People be crazy mad about bitcoin yo and don't know their head from a hole in the ground.  Everyone's trying to figure out which is which.

WHAT!!!??? ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE!!!  The financial sector WRITES the fucking rules.  They shove 1 billion in a politicians pocket and they WRITE THE FUCKING RULES.  The legislation is rubber stamped and made into law--enforcing their monopoly.  Why the fuck do you think they are attempting "regulation"?
Some of you are total fucking morons.  
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:50:11
It really doesn't.  In fact, I hope it is this guy.

Sell, sell, sell.  It doesn't matter.  Bitcoin is going to be around 100 years past all the hysteria.

OH MY GOD!  There is no regulating the central bank.  Have you fuckers lost your god damn minds.  No one can even audit them.  How fucking stupid are you people.  Central banks answer to NO FUCKING ONE.

The longer you goobers keep voting this up, the longer bitcoin will take to spread out and move up in value.
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SUB.  Downvote anything with MT Gox in the headline.

CNN is bought and paid for by the big banks.  I would NEVER expect a positive bitcoin article from them.
I am always SHOCKED when I see they have written something neutral.

I think it was heading back up until Shrem was arrested and we got Goxed with malleability.  If we get a major US exchange going with a BIG backer, hell perhaps Wells Fargo, and the major players come together on this malleability muckity, muck then I think it'll be on the rise again in a major way.

Intrinsic value is a myth. 
Overall, cultural value isn't a myth.  For instance, you may think Gold has intrinsic value because it is used to make semiconductors.  What if your culture doesn't value semiconductors.  I will guarantee you the people on the North Sentinel island don't value gold the same way you do.  Hell, native Americans gave it away for hardly anything hundreds of years ago.     
Bitcoin is only going to increase in cultural value as people realize it can be traded instantly everywhere and it's competition (fiat) is absolutely terrible and truly is a scam.  Also, the upcoming uses from smart contracts to asset control is going to give it many new cultural functions.
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:29:05


Just spent the last several posts proving to you how that's cultural.  We have to go over this again?  It's getting kind of tiring.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:48:23
I just showed you there is no such thing as intrinsic value in very clear terms.  It is all cultural.    
You should watch this episode.    
Also, one day as technology increases, we will be able to manufacture gold much more cheaply than we can now--which by the way we can.  Perhaps you didn't know that.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:00:31
I have a lot of disagreements with bitcoin but your argument is silly.  There are 180 fiat currencies recognized by the United Nations.  In reality, there are many, many more.  The quantity of crypto is a silly metric.  What really matters is their features, usefulness and fairness.
Every single one of the fiat currency is managed by central authority that is absolutely using it to their advantage.  Crypto will win out as people are recognizing the unfairness of fiat.  You can say a lot of things about crypto but it's far more fair than fiat.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:47:49
CNY is a horrible currency.  No one should accept it for anything.  The Chinese government has just admitted it can't compete fairly.

You would have a point if you said, in our current culture, gasoline has value.  Then, of course you'd have to admit that bitcoin has the same type of value.  
It's impossible to win an argument when you're just plain wrong.  You should start with being right.  That makes it much easier.
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:45:32


Replaced by electric cars and hydrogen--no more value.  Obviously cultural.  There is no such thing as intrinsic value--once again.


Better than any money before it in all characteristics of money.  If you're going to use money, eventually it will be the best.
