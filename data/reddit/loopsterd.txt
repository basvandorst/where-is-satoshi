Revolut and Change Bank at get-change.com. Coinbase issues a Shift visa pulling from crypto wallet. I am not sure if these are affected. 
This is actually a good sign that Visa is scared and the crypto universe will build better tools to make the old system obsolete. Coming soon enough but a little patience is needed.

Agreed. 
I asked Support and they said it was on the way but no ETA. 
The good news is the fees are 1.5% the same as Coinbase which is choking after I sent many non-techy friends there.

If you read the fine print if Coinbase gets hacked you are not insured crypto only for FIAT to what the laws protect ($200k).

BIG point is Coinbase does not insure your cryptos only your FIAT cash up to government limits in case they get hacked.

Square cash app for mobile phones is the easiest but they start with a small amount for the first month. 
Sign up for the Revolut Card. You can buy crypto but not export them to cold storage. Anyways if you are an American living overseas you are most likely getting raped with currency conversion fees. Revolut allows dozens of currencies with bank rate conversion fees. The trick is you need to have a foreign address. They will add US residents soon. 
This is always changing so check it out for yourself but it works well for me at this time.

NO, it is white poverty of rhythm syndrome which is seemingly cured by a pill.

I am getting ready to do the same. These resources might help.

Oh man, this changes constantly. This is my experience in the past year. I assume you have euros because any money change costs you %’s. I have tried many that did not exist or did not work. It is definitely growing. 
CoinATMradar is a helpful app but details are not trustworthy duch as hours or percentages. This will give you an idea of density of ATM’s ususlly being more friendly snd more competative fees. 
My summary in Spain ATM’s have a €1000 limit without ID. There are also some physical places to Buy and Sell crypto. The fees can be just under 10%. 
The Czech Republic seems very friendly with many ATM’s and Psralelni Polis in Prague which  a bitcoin community and offices. 
Switzerland allows buying at every 2000+ government run train ticket automated kiosks. I think the % was at 5. Their laws are friendlier by the day. A couple cities want to become bitcoin ambassadors. 
Germany did not have ATM’s but they have  Bitcoin Full Nodes in the world which means they find ways around it. 
Localbitcoins can be a good connection for people who know their country well. You can message them and ask details and possibly do a small amount then if you like them bump it up. 
I hear in Austria you buy at the post office. 
May this be if benefit.

To be honest I do not remember. Always check the fine print it changes by country always changing.

CoinATMradar.com for BTM’s. 
Check hodlhodl.com and bisq for in person live exchanges.

BisQ. Google it or just download it and see if a live person is available where you are to meet. 
I mispelled hodlhodl.com originally. Same instructions. Both are lower liquidity. Higher liquidity is localbitcoins.com but now needs ID.
