I didn’t, I’m pointing out flaws in btc. You want to convert it you have to use 3rd parties just like using a bank.

So because you have never had a problem means every else is wrong? Geez

It was my bitcoin in mt gox but I didn't have access to it
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:15:19
Sounds so much easier than just using my bank /s
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:08:19
Does your bank also not allow checks? Bitcoin is not the fix all to this overblown situation.

I couldnt have bought my house with bitcoin, or stayed at an apartment with bitcoin, or got a car loan. I also use google services and Instagram so I guess I’m ok with my data getting “pumped out”.

So find another cc which doesn't have fees for that? How often are you buying stuff overseas?

I wouldn't call finding a seller who would accept bitcoin a hassle, and if the seller wanted cash we would still have to use a 3rd party to convert the bitcoin into USD. Much more than just a hassle.

And you need to deposit money into the debit card to use it anywhere, giving control to a 3rd party. How is this different than a bank?

Or people just use nicehash to mine whatever and get paid in btc
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:21:48
recent as in the past few weeks or even 2018
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:47:24
The returns you have seen in the past...not anything recent right?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:56:48
Yea no
