Hi ujka,
I tried that yesterday night (new wallet.dat, import sig of my old account).
The BTC were avalaible in the new wallet but I couldn't send the coins to another account.
I think I'll never see my coins again, quite desesperate right now.

No I don't want to rebroadcast as the timeframe i had to send to the destination account is now elapsed...
I really hope that it will be canceled and returned to my wallet before being confirmed now.

Thanks I've understood: with this feature enabled i'll be able to set an higher fee for my tx.
I've done a -rescan so I'll try this as soon i'll access to the wallet again.

I used recommended and it's stuck for 24h :(

Could you please elaborate about the double spend solution ? I'm using bitcoin core qt.
Seems that i have to export my wallet signature and then import it in another software. 
Is that right ?

I can't find the option "enable coin control" in my bitcoin core qt (MacOS) .... :(
Would you kindly agree to be the friend of solution B from this guide ?
I will give you the sendrawtransaction command....
