Partly true, the random draw detail does need to be transparent otherwise the owner could just draw out one of his own addresses. Cawley22 has a long history on Reddit so from that perspective am supporting his credentials (i.e. he doesn't appear a scammer)

Yes the SEC fraudsters you are correct :-)

Good luck bitcoin23 car.

My download took about 3 days as well. You have to be determined to carry on with it when it takes so long.

Great data I will share this around, thanks for posting.

That's a lot of good stuff, great choice now. I just used you guys to buy Doge and I bought GHS at 0.00206 after the big sell off.

Ha ha, I forgot the 'too the moon' option

Mycelium have a new product in the pipe called Entropy which is designed to do exactly what you are trying to do (create and print offline wallets) but in a very easy way.

Ok, so a bit tongue in cheek, but if you are losing money in the markets this 50:50 approach might help ;-)
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:27:00
Yes please do that kiisfm
@_date: 2014-10-18 02:53:57
2 bitcoins would probably be enough for that;-)

I confirm receipt of refund.

CEX / GHash have no US footprint, the SEC have zero jurisdiction over them. This is so fake I can't believe there is even a debate.

It will take a long time to get back to $1,000, truth is no one knows where it could go. Those saying you haven't lost anything until you sell are wrong, it is worth 35% of what it was when you bought plain and simple.

Great resource thanks
@_date: 2014-10-01 05:27:30
It is profitable 
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:32:26
But as US$ just keeps on being printed from thin air likely the dynamic won't change too much even if Bitcoin grows fantastically??

What interests me most is the cause of fire in the first story. Short-circuit? Sounds too simple to be true.

Its magic internet money ;-)
@_date: 2014-10-02 02:54:58
Agree 100% good reminder that the focus should be on game changer advantages and not me too stuff.
@_date: 2014-08-06 08:06:48
CEX did a blog on your product  just today  Great solution congrats.
@_date: 2017-02-13 12:20:56
i think that is idea is really cool, but i wouldn't have invested all the money into bitcoin, perhaps, half of it. 
anyway, apart from keeping btc in a safe place, you should track bitcoin price literally everyday. i mean, you cannot put into lots of money into btc and forget about it for a couple of years. bitcoin market is so dynamic 
@_date: 2014-08-06 02:08:32
Its a cool idea very simple and transparent. Just need to promote the sh1t out of it to get to a wide enough audience to make the pool attractive. I'll start with my 0.01.

You are right. Money should be 'painless'.  
...I just remembered the times when I paid with my credit card and had to wait for tens of minutes until a connection is established between a POS terminal and the provider.
