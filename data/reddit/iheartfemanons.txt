Well, the miner also invested in hardware and electricity. So the assumption is that miners should also only mine if they can afford to not make profit or at least cover the costs.

Interesting how the coins are switching to hodl owners with every wave. Eventually it be become very solid.

I see how they can print useless Fiat currency. But how are they going to create new BTC? ����
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:45:07
Oh really?
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:11:17
Same as fiat money. Because people believe in its value. Difference to fiat money is that its based on unregulated demand &amp; supply.
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:16:21
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:29:39
Maybe you want to try describing it?
@_date: 2017-01-03 22:03:56
It wasn't clear to me that you intended to reinvest and hodl. In that case you're probably right - if the price keeps raising and the premium is only raising relatively.
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:37:23

@_date: 2017-01-03 21:18:18
You have a logical error. The premium is not decreasing just the relative bonus. In any case you're going to profit from it in an absolute manner, be it 1k or 5k.
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:17:41
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:59:33
It's the complete opposite. It happened.

I worked a lot with CSR and you can definitely tell the difference. Indians have that clueless yet arrogant attitude. That's why most companies switch to Philippians, they're leading to higher customer satisfaction.

@_date: 2016-12-06 22:44:22
My basic question is: is there a way to safely check if the private key is correct? Apart from the environment/software?
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:20:05

I wouldn't compare it with bubble but more with a cloud.
At first nobody knew what the cloud is and if their data is safe there. Today you barely find any app/gadget which isn't connected to the cloud and the people supposedly love it.
It's all about user experience.

True story. Expectation comes with disappointment.
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:49:49
Paper Wallet from 
There is a tutorial how to create it offline. You will get a paper with your public and private key. Transfer your BTC to the public key and store the paper in a safe place. I'd recommend to read the pinned posts for security measurements. You should not keep your BTC in an online wallet as they can be stolen/hacked.
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:38:26
No transaction fees? Interesting!
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:50:24
Probably  I guess.

They were generated offline buy I only had them as an image and wanted to make sure that there was no typo.
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:59:01
 Not that I have an idea but this looks reasonable: 
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:30:36
It's not a crash if the nose doesn't hit the ground. It's tripping at best.

I had the same issue in reverse. My bank account got locked because a buyer claimed that I didn't deliver the BTC through LBC even though everything went through smoothly. I am fighting for months with my bank to get my money back, even though the other side has the burden of proof.
