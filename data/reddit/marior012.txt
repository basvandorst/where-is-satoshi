I've been keeping an eye on both those coins! I also like librexcoin
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:56:40
Or why not just buy mining contracts (MN) at cryptsy? I have about 500 of them and day pay me a little bit of btc each day
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:14:06
Not really. That's just what I think, my opinion 
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:16:32
Well I did buy 3 btc at $330. Glad I sold at $285. Can't wait until we go under $200, heck at this pace by next moth it'll be under $100 hopefully!
@_date: 2015-01-29 05:33:33
Because the $300 is not guaranteed. For all we know we may never see $300 again
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:57:00
Thank you so much for your informative reply! I've lost $2k in trading so I retired from the crypto world a while ago. But then with the cheap btc price I had to come back. I bought $1000 worth of btc ranging from the $210 - $330 price range. I invested half of it into MN already and I'm in a nice position because the price of MN has increased in value a little bit in the last couple days. My plan was to invest the full $1000 in MN and lay back and watch the value of MN and btc rise while I accumulate btc every single day with my shares. Any thoughts about my plan bro? I think I'll have a lot of btc in the next few years with this plan. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:32:24
Come on $100!!!
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:22:06
Lol that sums it up pretty nicely 
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:09:34
Yeah I'll buy more. The price right now is stable and I'm pretty sure this is the bottom. And it looks like the price is slowly but steadily going back up. REMEMBER THIS ONLY MY OPINION, NOBODY KNOWS WERE BTC IS HEADED.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:21:50
I rather buy a house and put those $10000 as a down payment!
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:01:38
You missed the boat bro. Btc is still relatively cheap. Buy now because we're steadily going up. You won't see these prices again in a long time. Grab your astronaut suits boys, we have rinsed ourselves from the weak hands and barely started tapping into the immense potential of btc. Next stop, da moon boys.
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:45:38
In total with crypto trading I've lost $3k. I've cut way down now on the crypto game
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:52:16
Ouch. So I guess you're in hear for the long term? Have you bought at these “low" prices?
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:26:37
I'm really thinking about it and taking all of your guy's advice into consideration.... I'm not trying to get you mad bro....
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:35:21
The lowest it hit was $180 so I'm guessing that if goes any lower it will either be at $180 or even lower.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:43:42
Shit I have $100 and Idk if I should buy now or wait until morning!!!!
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:35:38
OMG DUDE YOU MADE ME CRACK UP SO HARD! LOL!!!
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:36:01
Why don't you trust mining contracts?
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:27:05
You lucky bastard
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:19:35
The thing is that the MN from Cryptsy is going up in value. I would reckon if the price starts to hit the crapper I'll sell before it get me in the negative and cash it in since I bought it at a lower price taking off with the profit from selling it and the accumulating the shares from it.
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:50:43
That's not what she said
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:36:01
Same here. Bought 3 btc at $330 each. Then sold them for $285 each, so I'm fucking happy the price is going down the shitter
@_date: 2015-01-19 03:20:22
Has anyone?
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:25:19
Goddam!!!! Now to $100 hooray!!!!
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:43:13
What do you think about mining contracts (MN) from cryptsy? I have about 500 of them
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:27:23
I'm thinking hard about this one man
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:27:45
I say waste a third of your money at $150, another third at $100 and if it continues to go down STOP AND SELL IT ALL BACK BEFORE IT GOES TO $10 OR $1 AND THEN BUY EVERYTHING WITH YOUR REMAINING MONEY.
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:50:14
Ah fuck it, I'm going for it
@_date: 2015-01-29 06:17:19
Dude that video got me scared! Lol
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:34:38
Thanks for your input. Just because its an exchange site like Cryptsy I'm thinking its legit and a good thing to do
@_date: 2015-01-29 05:38:44
You never know, it might even go lower. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2015-01-01 03:16:16
Hmmm. Hopefully we are at the floor right now. I'm thinking hard about this one and I want to look back after it next year. I'm going to say....$350. A rollercoaster ride again, up and down to $650 to a very stable $350. Idk why but I keep thinking that each coin will end up being $100, $10 or $1 just because most people resonate like that. Btw OP what's your prediction?
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:31:54
Fuck yeah! Thank god I cashed out at $285! 
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:41:37
I say panic selling at its highest will be here in a few days, new technology will be a killer. I say $50 in the near future then a stable $10. Then it moons again only to crash down hard
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:07:22
I never said you were.
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:36:10
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:20:38
Seven btc?
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:37:04
Idk honestly. I do have some mining contracts at Cryptsy so I'm not worrying about buying some btc now
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:47:23
Well one MN has lost half of its value in cryptsy on the last couple of months. And now its steadily going up. I just reckon that cheap btc and cheap MN right now makes sense.
@_date: 2015-01-29 05:37:51
I rather set my price lower than now than buy right now. How is that stupid? I rather wait and buy lower than buy right now and watch it sink some more and kick myself for not waiting at my target price. I would rather for it to go up at this point since I bought the 5 btc at $250. But why buy more at this price if it looks like its going down to $180 again?
@_date: 2015-01-29 06:08:04
EXACTLY THANK YOU!
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:35:27
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:16:33
 I'm buying 20 more actually
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:32:20
Oh dude you had me laughing like a mad man lol!!!!! How much have you lost???
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:29:44
I'm thinking hard about it bro
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:48:17
Don't say that! I bought 5 at $250!
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:56:43
Holy shit you're crazy! You could buy a cheap house and rent it with that kind of money!
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:03:59
Damn now I'm having second thoughts. But like I said MN is going up. I reckon if it goes down I'll sell and get out of trouble
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:36:11
Dude its going down. The question is where will it land?
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:43:13
Bitcoin giveaway???!!! Christmas all over again, yay!!!
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:31:46
Awe fuck I have a shitload of mining contracts (MN) with Cryptsy now this fucking article got me scared :-(
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:17:43
I'm sorry but I'm only buying again if it goes under $180 again. There's no way I'm buying again at these current prices honestly.
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:10:08
Its not that its just that having btc sitting around isn't ideal too me. Why not spend it and get payouts every day for years??? Ill be in a profit in the long run
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:43:22
That's pretty sadistic. You got problems bro
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:02:18
But its cryptsy, not scammers. Im thinking about it
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:05:23
Tell me about it bro. Bought some btc around $650 and lost it all by trading coins. In total I lost about 2k. I retired from the game and came back recently. I bought about 3 btc at $330. I invested half in mining contracts and I sold the other half at $285 (thank god for that). Recently I bought 2 more btc at $210 and it isn't looking good since it looks like the price is heading down again. I might just invest my remaining btc in mining contracts and just forget about it and come back in a few years and hopefully have a shitload of money worth by then lol
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:25:56
Idk but I bought 6 btc on an impulse at $232. This looks bad and the bickering is going to get brutal in the upcoming weeks and months. I expect this negative buzz to make btc lose value. I'm just waiting for coinbase to give me the btc to cash out immediately
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:34:53
I bought 3 at $230 and another 3 at $232 After selling 5.8 btc at $270 :D
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:57:23
I dumped my 5.8 btc at $270 and now I just bought back 6 btc at $232. Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:32:52
I say $230s all week long until Tuesday hits. By then I expect a big pump or dump. You heard it from me first!
@_date: 2015-08-19 07:22:36
Ok now in the 250's then!
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:20:00
Buy 1/3 at $150, 1/3 at $175 and 1/3 at $200. Don't be dumb like me, I bought 6 btc at $232 yesterday. Have patience bro, this might get brutal.
@_date: 2015-08-19 06:24:48
240's it is then!
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:42:08
Um I don't get the point of this at all. Why not just simply pay with a debit/credit card or bitcoin then?
@_date: 2015-04-24 23:17:24
Lost about 2-3k in combination of btc price going down and trading it for shitcoins
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:32:46
Sorry. I just wanted opinions.
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:50:37
Really? :)
@_date: 2015-04-20 19:45:19
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:23:27
I just wanted opinions on it. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 04:57:20
I guess I'll be the only one with the balls to tell you the truth. STAY AWAY FROM THE CRYPTO GAME, YOU WILL ONLY LOSE MONEY! The time of getting rich by investing in bitcoin has passed. Save your money and get another job. I wish someone would've told me that, I've lost a couple of thousand dollars on this. I don't want that to happen to you, it sucks
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:38:29
This is really interesting. I might sign up. Are there any fees? What's the catch?
@_date: 2015-04-20 06:05:24
Big dump incoming for sure
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:11:02
I couldn't because coinbase took forever to give its coins
 :-(
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:47:11
PROBLEM SOLVED THANKS GUYS!!!!!!
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:31:35
Bought 5 around at $250. I've bought some before and foolishly tried the trading game and lost about 2k. So at this point I'm just hoping it moons high because other than those 5 btc I ain't got no job, no career, no education and I ain't got shit to do so I look at the price about once an hour
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:18:39
The page doesn't load for me :-(
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:42:31
Don't get too excited there at the end buddy, but agree with everything you said in the beginning
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:24:21
If we go down below $180, $150 at the most all the current investors holding btc will be fucked, myself included. We will all probably sell to recover a fraction of our investment which will lower the btc price even more. What will happen then is that we will be at the mercy of the rich whales because the cheaper btc is the easier it is for them to manipulate it.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:29:02
Agree with you %100
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:27:14
OMG THIS HAD LAUGHING MY LUNGS OUT!!! lsughin
