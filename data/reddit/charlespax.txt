Laundering money typically refers to masking the source of income. It could be from an illegal source or legitimate.
Let's say someone were handing you 30k per year in cash and you dont want anyone to know you have it and you want to avoid taxes entirely. You can just bury it in a mattress. If you want crypto, you'll probably want to use localbitcoins.com to but Bitcoin in-person with cash. You would then still need to keep your spending activities secret, so the spending I not connected to you.
If you want to launder money properly, you want a way to make that 30k per month look like normal income and pay taxes on it. In that case, start a pizzaria or other cash-heavy business.
But there's really no need to launder money. Just claim it as regular income and pay taxes.

Andreas is a great speaker and seems very humble and thoughtful. I imagine he is taking time to craft a beautiful thank you letter to those who have supported him and continue to support him. This is an extreme event he was likely not prepared for and he needs time to process it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:46:21
That would be true if you do the $1000 transaction in a single shot. A great thing about Lightning is that you can basically stream that money over in many smaller payments over a short period of time. On the user side you would see a single $1000 transaction, but the network might see one-thousand $1 transactions.
You send $1 to Gramma through a payment channel. Gramma releases the key (or whatever the term would be). Everyone through the payment channel gets $1 in and gives $1 out. That transaction only required $1 in the open channel. Now repeat 999 more times and gramma has her $1000.

While 2MB may not be a problem, HARD forking is a hell of a big deal.
Also, there is the opportunity cost. While developers are working on code to double transaction capacity by doubling block size, they are not working on other code that will increase transaction 1000x through other means.
The risks and costs associated with a 2MB hard fork are not worth the small benefit.

Imagine you have a coinbase account. You go on your account page and click a button to open and fund a payment channel between you and coinbase. Now you can make a lightning transaction with anyone that has a payment channel open with coinbase.
Now imagine bitpay and kraken does the same with their users. Now all it takes is a single payment channel between coinbase and kraken and a single payment channel between kraken and bitpay for all of their combined users to be able to send lightning transactions to each other.
As a coinbase user you could go to a coffee shop and pay over lightning to the shop's bitpay account via kraken. And to both you and the shop the routing would be invisible. You wouldn't have to know anything about the routing.

Maybe the bump in the first graph is a test using lots of individual transactions and the bump in the third graph is a test with a smaller number of transactions each having lots of inputs and outputs to increase the witness size.
Is there a block explorer where you can sort transactions in a block by witness size?
I'd wonder if a lot of those transactions are back and forth between the same set of addresses.

It's a different use of the word "scaling." As the price increases the price history graph will scale to show the new data along both time and price axis. As the price axis changes to accommodate a larger price the December 2013 peak will scale smaller and smaller.

I bought some Bitcoin just before the December 2013 peak for around $520. I was so happy watching it go up. Watching it go down down down and stay down hurt. Going through most of 2014, 2015, 2016 was brutal.
Now I smile each time I look at the entire Bitcoin price history and watch as that December 2013 peak grows smaller and smaller. One day it will be just a tiny bump, barely noticeable.

I'm pretty sure I'm the only person to ever use it. I wrote Nodalizer when I was setting up my bitcoin/lightning node. As I followed the instructions I wrote the script to automate each step. It may not be perfect, but it's what I used to get my node running. I also use it to update my node. Just run nodalizer.sh.
I'm sure there are steps that I left out. Maybe the RPC password stuff. I haven't looked at in a while, so I really couldn't say.
I'm a random guy on the internet, so you should be careful running a script. My advice:
1. Read through the script yourself, so you can see if there is any malicious content
2. Use a laptop or computer that is for no other purpose
3. Don't put more than a TRIVIAL amount of funds on that machine to play with.

The lightning network is a layer upon which users exchange native bitcoin transactions. If the parties you are exchanging with become uncooperative, there are native Bitcoin blockchain remedies. The protocol guarantees your bitcoin is as safe as if it were transacted directly on the blockchain. Check out this video explaination (
The new code actually *implementing* the lightning network protocol, however, has the potential to introduce new bugs. The lightning network currently exists and is under testing. When it is solid enough to handle real bitcoin, it will start seeing it on the real blockchain.

I speculate that each node is run on a single machine to mitigate risk. If a single machine is compromised, only the bitcoin on that machine can be stolen. 400 BTC on a single machine would be quite a target.

For a big transaction like this I would recommend Alice (sender) send Bob (receiver) a small amount first. Then Bob sends Alice a small amount to prove that is the correct address and that Bob can spend from it. The Alice send the remainder to Bob.

As miners drop out, each remaining miner has an increased chance of winning the next block reward thereby incentivising miners not drop out.
Presumably, the fees in each block would increase and be another incentive.
The incentives for and against eventually reach equilibrium. There will be a period of high block times, but there wouldn't be a death spiral.
@_date: 2019-09-05 13:17:53
If the average transaction fee is 0.000000032 BCH/byte and there are 1,000,000 bytes/megabyte, and the price is $300 USD/BCH, that's less than $10 per megabyte or about $300 to fill a 32 megabyte block.
The miner reward is $3,600 USD per block. Why bother messing with transactions when they represent less than 10% of the reward. It's probably not worth being a little slower at generating a block.

That looks pretty good to me. I have a a Cryptosteel and I enjoy the piece of mind that neither heat nor chemicals will destroy the stamped letters. I always thought laser etching was a superficial surface treatment and not something that could really stand up to harsh chemicals or fire. From what I see in the pictures it looks like they can stand up to heat pretty well.

Here's what I do. As the price is goes up I check it frequently and enjoy the excitement. As the price goes down I ignore it and enjoy other things.

Ignore it too.

Electrum used to use their own word list and algorithm rather than BIP39. It might still do their own thing. Since your seed works in Electrum, it is probably their made using their list. That's a good start.
Now you need to worry about "derivation path". I think the default now is m/49/0'/0' (segwit), but it used to be m/44/0'/0' I think.
When did you make that seed? Do you remember making it in Electrum?
Try going to r/Electrum and asking, "I have an Electrum seed from around [your best date guess]. What should the derivation path be?"

Yes, I misspoke. I was assuming a rather low cost basis where selling one's position would realize a gain enough that the capital gains taxes may not be covered by the single day 10% gain. I was writing from my own perspective.
I agree, if someone bought two days ago and sold today they would still see a nice profit even with a short term capital gains tax.
Hopefully, I can hang onto Bitcoin until after there is some sort of capital gains exemption legislation.

It would be more accurate to call a "Bitcoin ATM" a "Bitcoin vending machine." Typically, you put fiat cash into the machine and the machine gives you a printed qrcode. You then scan the qrcode into your phone's Bitcoin wallet to redeem it for Bitcoin.
I've never seen a "Bitcoin ATM" that will hand out cash. I haven't looked into this in a few years though. Is this still true?
