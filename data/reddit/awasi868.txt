in google sheets:
    =substitute(substitute(index(IMPORTDATA(" ",""), char(34), "")
if you mean in browser, on 1080p screen desktop it shows exact values. if you make window narrower, it switches to abbreviation.

I'm testing the lntipbot and you're first post I saw

Not only. There's also the issue of access to the data, for example.

first of all those aren't wallets, they are addresses
many of those addresses can be from same wallet since by default addresses aren't reused
I have countless small amounts spread over countless addresses created by countless wallets, many of them are too small to bother spending, some are cold storage, some I'm just lazy about
I also have large amounts on exchange sometimes like countless others
This article is nonsense

the easiest ux for lightning without being custodial is I believe the 2nd wallet from ACINQ called Phoenix
Personally I really like both BLW and eclair.
