This is a message from Kuwait supporting what BTCJam is doing and doing right. Of course, there is much more they can do and I know they are doing their best to iron out issues and make it better platform for both investors and those borrowing. It is great idea and my hats off to those who set this up. Until now I thought Brazil to be just sun, sand, samba and beautiful women. I stand corrected now! 
Have I been scammed by borrowers? YES. Would I blame it on BTCJam? Certainly not. They are as legitimate as one can expect. Last month one of my friends (there are only two from Kuwait on BTCJam so far) lost a few bitcoins from BTCJam through the heart bleed vulnerability. Guess what BTCJam did? They returned it back to him within the blink of an eye! Wow. Now which fraudulent company does that?
I am somewhat active on the BTCJam unofficial FB group and privy to what happened with Avastar1. He does not belong there - not even by a long shot. What he is doing here is nothing more than shouting out "sour grapes". Best to disregard people him who are nothing but a nuisance to good and thriving communities like BTCJam and all those honest people who have benefited one way or the other through that platform.

Me too... Same story here. Best to post about them all over the net so that others won't fall prey to this scam.

BTClevels.com - They have SCAMMED me too. I am unable to withdraw the deposit I made. Wrote to them atleast three times with no reply. Best that people be mindful of this website.

This is a SCAM. I deposited money with btclevels and have since written to them many time to help me get my btc out but there is no response. It has been many months now. Beware of them.
