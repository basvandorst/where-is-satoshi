The first thing I did. It's also weird that there is no option for phishing when reporting adds. It just seems like it would be of greater concern that google is sponsoring phishing adds.

now I'm never going to click an ad ever again. I used to click them intentionally because I know google is payed for it.

Uncomfortable how? I thought it was good, sure he's ranting but if you don't like that don't watch talks on youtube.

Yea, chromium auto completed the address to "blockchain.info wallet" which is kinda weird, and out of laziness I just clicked the first and only add. First login on this browser would also require the identifier. Phishing was just not in my mind at all, my first thought was even that my chromium was hacked because it said the website tried to access my webcam.
Now I'm just mad that no one has reported it to google. Maybe the other victims haven't even realized it.

I stated that I would like some compensation in the report but we know that's not gonna happen. I still feel betrayed, the auto suggestion seemed almost set up for this to happen and there was nothing in the add that would give it away, fake address and everything. Perhaps the asshole used some adwords-fu to lure people to his site. 20+ btc in some two days so it's pretty effective. seems like one more victim after me.

saving is much bigger in east asian cultures, but since the demand is just not going to be there I don't know how much that will matter.

eventually ~500, but it will rebound to 900+ before that. next summer it will reach 5000+, reaching 10 000+ 2015.

there is no substantial demand for bitcoins outside of speculation, even if you hold if no one wants to buy at this price it will go down.
