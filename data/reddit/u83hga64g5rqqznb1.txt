what is causing the decline? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:49:09
You could maybe find someone in your local area and make the exchange there. [Meetup.com]( has groups of people that you can find based on your location. eBay also auctions for BTC but they are [overpriced]( 
If you have a car 40 miles isn't so bad, maybe have parents drive you to sellers?

Hmm [Paxful]( might work I have never tried it though. Some vendors might be scammers.

@_date: 2017-07-26 18:17:01
Nope I am using Bitcoin.com wallet I guess it can't receive testnet coins
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:08:32
what about BCC
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:46:27
those will become more common as fiat declines
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:17:16
It seems like people want to get in on it while they can with the free BCC
