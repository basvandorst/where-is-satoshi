@_date: 2017-02-28 23:43:40
You do not need a cable to tranfer if you simply make note of one of the addresses on your Ledger and send to that address. Bitcoin is not stored inside the wallet (ledger or any other). It is recoded on the blockchain and the keys to use your bitcoin are stored on the Ledger. The backup of the keys are what the 24 word phrase is. All keys are derived from that phrase.
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:17:48
Confirmation of each transaction could take 10 minutes or a few hours. The wallet software will show you when the transactions have confirmed.
@_date: 2017-02-19 20:39:18
Why not Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:27:32
This is not true for some hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:14:34
Nope. Sooner the better :) Just make sure your 24 words are written down carefully and stored in a safe place. When I first setup mine I sent a very small amount of bitcoin (0.001) to the first address after writing down the backup words. Then I put in the wrong pin 3 times which reset the device. I restored the backup phrase and checked to make sure the keys were the same by sending the bitcoin to someplace else. Once the transaction confirmed I sent the rest of my bitcoin to the next Ledger address. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 02:13:25
Nope it has a display and all key operations and transaction confirmations happen on the display.
@_date: 2017-02-20 07:52:14
Does KeepKey use a Secure Element for key generation and storage? Ledger Nano S does.
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:52:03
Ledger Nano S is also nice.
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:20:14
Ledger Nano S. Best hardware wallet from a security standpoint.
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:34:07
I use a Ledger Nano S. Without my 8 digit pin there is no way to access the device and use my keys since it has a separate chip for keys from the main operating system CPU (SIOC). Even with the pin the keys never are exposed to the host device.
Hardware wallets are very easy to use to spend money. I have mine with me all the time on my key chain along with a small OTG cable to connect with my phone for signing transactions. Just takes a few seconds to enter my pin and confirm the transaction on the Ledger's screen.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:47:05
The buttons are fine. You may have had a bad unit. Myself and several of my friends use Nano S wallets on a regular basis without issue. They also recently improved the PIN entry interface.
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:21:38
Yes you will have coins on both chains. How easy it will be depends on several things including Trezor changing their software. Just sit on your money and wait it out if anything even happens.
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:42:46
Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:18:35
200sat/byte? Depends on network load. Best build your script to calculate it on the fly or use an existing API which provides the most efficient fee based on network load.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:45:17
Ledger Nano S. It has a hardware security module searapte from the main processor that holds your keys. Trezor can be physically attacked and the keys extracted from its chip. The Nano S with its Secure Element chip is highly resistant to physical attack. I carry mine with me every day on my key chain (it is the smallest hardware wallet available) and I would be sad if it got stolen but I would not panic that my keys will be compromised. Of course, out of pure paranoia I would use a different seed with my replacement Nano S.
The Nano S also supports many different cryptocurrancies and U2F authentication.
Any hardware wallet is better than something on your phone or PC. But considering price, technology under the hood and size that allows you to always carry it I would recommend the Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:28:58
Yes you are fine. Just leave your money alone. I am also holding on a Ledger (the Nano S)
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:18:21
Use pruning. This will allow you to specify disk space used. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:02:28
There are no known public reports that a Trezor has been physically compromized where keys have been extracted, true. It doesn't make it any less true that the Ledger Nanp S has an advantage in physical security. Both are good and either is far better than storing keys on an internet connected device.
If someone I knew bought a Trezor instead of a Ledger I would be happy they have a hardware wallet. I simply recommend one over the other.
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:43:41
Use a different system. Maybe download Mycelium on your phone and attach your Ledger to it. Then you can import and verify your addresses. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:11:38
+1 this. I always build from source. Really easy.

What about one with a very short cable? I think having a direct adaptor would put a lot of strain on the connectors.
This is what I use with my Ledger Nano S. Keep it threaded through my key ring in my pocket all the time.
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:54:12
Gold costs money to mine. The equipment, labor, time and processing costs are tangible and account for a significant portion of the value placed in fiat or another currency. I believe it is around US$1100 per oz landed at a distributor. This means jewelery, collectible bullion and industrial uses all have a floor around that price. 
Bitcoin's intrinsic value, according to some opinions, is the cost of hardware and electricity to support the network as it exists today.
Just like Bitcoin miners turn off their rigs when the price drops too low to be profitable, gold miners do the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:32:41
No, just leave your Ledger alone for a few days while the dust settles. Best not do any transactions during a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:50:25
Ledger Nano S with my car keys in my pocket always on me.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:05:04
I can't predict what the procedure will be to trade your BTU for BTC but yes if you have the keys you control both if a fork happens. Just be calm and wait until the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:12:04
Yes the Ledger Nano S would protect anyone in that situation. The private keys are never exposed to the host device (PC or phone) and all confirmations happen on the device display so even if the malware happened to catch a signing request in flight and make changes you would see the changes and deny the transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:32:59
Nope. You control the keys so that is good. Just make sure you have a backup.

@_date: 2017-03-20 03:15:38
You will own both if you have the keys to your current BTC. If the wallet you are using doesn't support both then you can import the keys (likely a seed phrase) to whatever wallet does support it. So in summary, stick with whatever you have that is the most secure wallet where you hold your keys and have a backup.
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:23:24

@_date: 2017-03-22 02:34:02
Do nothing until the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:03:43
It does not. If a fork happens the keys you hold simply have access to money on both chains.
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:15:55
Ledger Nano S is also a good choice for hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:40:48
No. It would require a software update from Breadwallet. However you would hold the keys which will work on both chains.
Don't worry about the potential fork. If you have your keys to BTC securely stored and backed up then whatever happens you will be able to control your money. Just don't try to move things around right after a fork due to potential replay attacks. Just sit and wait.
Oh and if Breadwallet doesn't update with the changes you want you can use your seed phrase on some other wallet software.
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:54:19
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:10:08
Electrum is good. Backup your seed phrase on paper and store it someplace safe.
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:59:07
No. Like Ledger Nano S, Trezor or KeepKey. I recommend the 1st one.
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:36:43
Keep calm and carry on :) I am watching things closely like everyone. I have invested in mining hardware and even bought some BTC with fiat. I would be disappointed if my ROI was negative but I am not going to sell. All of my crypto keys are protected by a Ledger Nano S and if a fork happens I plan to not touch anything, just watch and wait.
Oh and make sure you hold the keys to your coins. If they are sitting on some web wallet or exchange, move them now. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:14:39
Breadwallet, Mycelium, and of course hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S.
Most important thing is that you control the keys to your bitcoin. Don't store them on a web wallet or exchange.

@_date: 2017-03-21 16:01:05
It is not 100% without risk. There is always a small chance that the firmware you download is from a bad source. But if you follow the instructions Ledger provides and confirm the information on the Nano S screen it will be fine.
If the firmware is bad the Ledger will wipe the keys before installing so it is ok.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:08:26
Think Window 3.1 vs Windows 10 and browsing the web. Terrible example but my point is you can't expect old software to operate properly when the servers it acesses are being changed with upgrades. The way fees are calculated has changed in almost every wallet software package.
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:36:29
Instead of wget why not use Git? Would allow rollback to previous version and upgrades easily.

Yelp has an "Accepts Bitcoin" search filter. There are many other resources.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:47:48
Or Ledger Nano S (costs less, better hardware)
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:10:07
As Ledger releases new code (additional cryptocurrancy support, upgrades with new features like SegWit, etc...) you will be able to install the new wallets and upgrade the existing wallets. All of the wallets and other features base off your one master seed. For example I bought my Ledger Nano S when there was only BTC and ETH but since then I upgraded the firmware and also added the wallet apps for ZEC, LTC and others. All use the same master seed as the base derivation key for each cryptocurrancy.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:12:49
Yes, I use them frequently.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:42:31
I forgot they use a non standard set of words. I use a Ledger Nano S wallet so Electrum is just a front end to the Nano S for me. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:36:50
Ledger Nano S. Costs less than the others and has strong security with two chips, one being dedicated to secure key storage.
Just get something and get your funds out of someone else's hands.
Dont want to spend money? Try Breadwallet or Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:38:56
That is a good idea. Bitpay would mitigate most of the risk of price changes.

You are incorrect. Nodes do validate transactions and only relay transactions that are valid. Miners also run nodes. They take those validated transactions from their node and pack them in to a block to confirm them; making them a permanent addition to the blockchain.
It is always best to run your own node with the full blockchain so you can validate on your own system without trusting a 3rd party.

Right now the "easiest" way, which someone else mentioned, is to use Electrum with your own sever and node.
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:34:07
Ledger Nano S. Integrates with both Electrum and Mycelium but stores your keys securely instead of having them on your PC or phone. It is as close as you can get to cold storage and still able to easily spend your funds. You can buy one with Bitcoin or from Amazon. Give yourself the gift of strong security for your funds because you will be your own bank.

Depending where you live a 500w array will only give you about 2kwh per day in the summer, less during the winter, in ideal conditions. That would give you an 80 watt power budget. You are not going to be able to run much on 80w. If you just want to put something on it for fun then try a Raspberry Pi with a USB mining stick.
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:19:57
Yes I was referencing a suggestion to buy both and put different amounts on each. I agree with you that having the same keys (well, derivation seed) on both negates the advantage of having both.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:00:55
It is safe to buy from Amazon but don't pay the crazy prices the 3rd party vendors are setting right now.
@_date: 2016-12-01 04:04:28

Or buy a Ledger Nano S so you don't need to be concerned with seals and whatnot. It uses cryptographic attestation to verify every time you connect it to your computer and run the software. Trezor is just a basic (vulnerable) small computer without a Secure Element.
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:33:24
You likely paid too small a fee. 48 hours ago it was about $0.13 to run a small transaction, now it is almost $0.40 due to a very busy network. I use BitPay and it is confirming incoming bitcoin just fine with adjusted fees for the recent network traffic.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:47:22
When the Trezor has a Secure Element maybe you can say it is the same as the Ledger Nano S. In its current form it is not the best because the Ledger Nano S is better due to the Secure Element and already supporting many other blockchains like Litecoin, Dogecoin, Zcash, Ethereum and Dash along with Bitcoin of course. It is also much easier to carry with you on your key ring like a thumb drive.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:03:31
You may have heard reference that they use a standard microprocessor so it would be trivial to extract the keys from the flash storage with the right equipment and physical access. The Ledger uses a smart chip to store your keys making it significantly more difficult to physically attack. Other then that they are both hardware wallets and far better then other choices to store your keys.
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:00:35
Or a [Ledger Nano S]( 
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:00:17
Legder Nano S is excellent and, IMHO, has a better security model than the Trezor. But don't take this the wrong way, both are excellent hardware wallets and good choices to securely store blockchain private keys. Someone else suggested getting both. If you have the money, why not?
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:42:26
Bumping it up will only work if it is calculating properly. Fees are based on the size in bytes of the transaction you are about to broadcast. A few factors contribute to the size but the amount of BTC doesn't directly impact it. I am typing this on a phone so google is your friend to learn more.
As for confirming the fee is good before transmitting the transaction, check here: [
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:18:28

I would do 40% in gold, no silver or minimal, rest in Bitcoin with maybe some alts peppered in if you want to play the market.
Store the crypto on a Ledger Nano S (or two) with a well secured backup of the seed.

Ledger Nano S for PC and phone.
@_date: 2017-04-05 04:39:33
There is no higher risk with the ledger at all. In fact, the Ledger Nano S has a secure element which stores your keys. This is like a smart chip where it can't be easily broken in to if someone gets physical access to it. In my opinion this feature puts it above the others slightly. However any of those hardware wallets are a good idea.

@_date: 2017-09-09 02:45:44
Ignore the troll. Also use Segwit for low fees.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:42:46
To add to that; there is no such thing as a 100% secure system, just like perfection doesn't exist. Think about door locks. Even the hardest lock to pick would be extremely simple if you could see everything inside it while you pick it and had all the right tools. A transparent lock if you will. 
Open Source is a great thing. I am all for it in the right places. Bitcoin has attack vectors but they are negated by the network rules and distribution of nodes around the world. A single device has different attack vectors and must be secured differently. With physical access to the device this is nearly impossible unless you use some closed source to create the equivalent of a high security door lock. Sure given time and resources maybe someone will be able to find their way in but it will be much harder than a fully open source device.

Many merchants get paid within a business day of a credit/debit sale. It is called next day funding. Or are you referring to the timeframe where it could be reversed?
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:39:23
Trezor is widely shilled as the best but it is not from a technical perspective. The Ledger Nano S is a better hardware and software design. This is why they haven't had any security issues, unlike Trezor.
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:50:52
It is the same master seed (where all your keys come from), same wallet. 
The full history is on chain with Segwit. Confirmations are on the Bitcoin chain. You may be thinking Lightning network where there will be a side chain (also decentralized) with the full history that settles to the Bitcoin chain. So Bitcoin only sees the beginning and end of the set of transactions where you need to go look at the Lightning chain to see details. I am not an expert but I am slowly absorbing the knowledge. I may not be describing it correctly.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:21:53
Yes. There haven't been any security issues with the Ledger Nano S (yet?). Can't say the same for Trezor since they had, and fixed, an issue (granted it was a very small attack vector). Still both are much better than a PC or phone wallet. Always control your private keys or it is not your money.
I prefer the Ledger for several reasons. Just read my comment history. One reason is it's small size ;)

The big difference is Segwit transactions aren't centralized. They are peer to peer as intended. Transferring on coinbase isn't bitcoin at all, it is a database at a bank.
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:11:11
It validates automatically. Buying from Amazon is fine.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:30:58
So 1% (or something very small) of the code is closed and the vast majority is open source. Just want that to be clear. 
Hypothetically if everyone and everything that had Bitcoin used a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor this would be 70ish billion USD worth of funds "at risk" in trusting those devices. The banking systems are protecting tens of trillions of USD worth in assets. Yes I want that same security in my hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:16:28
If it doesn't work you still haven't installed your own node. :)
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:19:49
The cash price is the "regular" price. Visa/MC allow merchants to charge a "convience fee" for credit/debit purchases within some limits. Some places have laws that prevent this. So the bitcoin price would need to be the same as the cash price.

@_date: 2017-09-11 20:52:20
I understand your point but they are using chips that are industry standard and have been around awhile. They didn't invent it themselves so it can be said it is well tested. This is why it is closed source, they didn't write it. The open source parts are on the main processor.

May want to consider a hardware wallet then.
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:33:40
Their hardware is not equal. The Trezor completely lacks any physical security barriers to accessing it's storage. The Ledger Nano S has a hardened security chip separate from the main processor to segregate the keys so they are significantly more difficult to obtain with physical access to the device.
Minus any "sufficient testing" and considering the recent Trezor news I stand by my statement that the Ledger is more secure.
I do agree both are better then storing on a PC/Mac/smartphone/exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:18:28
Raspberry Pi 3 - works great just a slow first sync.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:19:15
Nope. The pin has nothing to do with the recovery seed. It is only to access the device. The passphrase is your only security against someone sweeping all the balances from the seed. Make sure it is a good one :)
A little advice. Not sure if Trezor does it but on my Ledger I have some used accounts based on the seed without a passphrase that have small balances ($20 or so combined at today's prices). So if someone finds my 24 words they will think they swept the wallet when the real balances are a different set of derived keys due to the passphrase. Also Ledger supports multiple passphrases each with their own PIN.

If you have a very good memory and nobody you want to pass on your money to if you die suddenly then a brain wallet is fine. I prefer my wife is able to recover my wallet if I get run over by a bus.

Very low. 10sat/byte
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:12:08
Buy either one. Just don't buy Trezor because of the closed source FUD. Also look at the device size. The Ledger fits on your keyring like a USB disk. The Trezor is too big to carry on your keys.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:44:03
No difference in terms of the fork. Both have been relatively quick to support significant forks.
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:01:05
Ledger is.
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:57:25
Yes. No.

Btchip answered better than I could. Open Source doesn't directly equate to secure. That is like saying the only secure physical door lock is transparent so you can confirm how it works and nobody tampered with it. At my day job we must use several closed source devices such as HSMs to secure sensitive data to meet compliance requirements. These companies stay in business because they can be trusted with trillions of dollars of transaction data. 
Ledger hardware is likely attacked daily just like every other popular security device out there. So far the only recent news about security flaws was with the fully open source Trezor. Does that make Trezor bad? Nope. But they decided to reinvent the wheel instead of using an existing hardware security chip. Their wheel had a flaw. 
Maybe someday someone will find a flaw in the Ledger design. However I trust Ledger more because with my limited knowledge of embedded devices I could extract the Trezor chip (with great effort) and read the flash contents to obtain the seed and any stored passwords. Since it is open source I will know exactly where to look. I can't do this with a secure element, like in the Ledger, due to its safeguards against reading the flash.
BTW I have been accused of being a Ledger shill before. I am just a happy customer and I think Trezor gets pushed a lot more so I try to even it out. They are both much better than other wallet options, espcially a wallet on a PC or (gag) web wallets. But compared to each other the Ledger is a better security and physical design.
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:26:34
This is the only right answer.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:10:01
This is false. 99% of Ledger code is open source. Only the small part of code that runs on the secure element (the smart chip) is closed because the manufacturer has an NDA with Ledger.
Trezor has had a security vulnerability and will always be vulnerable to physical attack since it lacks hardened key storage.
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:23:48
Yes safe. No issues.

Another Ledger Nano S here.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:09:23
Yep. The bulk of the code is open source and on GitHub.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:40:21
Wherever you buy it, hook it up to your computer, do the on device setup and then load the Ledger Wallet chrome app. The app will check the device and if it is modified it will warn you. This is called cryptographic attestation and is explained on Ledger's site.
I used both Amazon and direct with Ledger. I've bought many as gifts. No issues.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:24:11
They are both fine. I like the Ledger Nano S because it is small so I can keep it on my key ring with my house and car key. It also supports more alt coins if that interests you. It also has Fido U2F authentication built in so you can enable logging in to Google and many other U2F compatible sites using the same 24 word backup seed as your cryptocurrancy.
As for the open or closed source crap you may see. It doesn't matter. 99% of Ledger code is open. The only closed part is the separate security chip and that is due to an NDA from the manufacturer. Don't make a buying decision based on the stupid open source debate.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:35:23
Good job!
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:42:31
I have a Ledger Nano S. I would recommend it.

To actually use and benefit from Segwit you need to send your current balances to your new Segwit addresses. After that any transactions will use Segwit and you will pay lower fees.
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:14:23
For just cold storage it doesn't really matter which one you get. I prefer the Ledger Nano S.

BTW I have been having issues signing multisig transactions using more than one Nano S with Electrum (older ver and newest). Can I message you to troubleshoot?
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:23:59
Why not just buy the $60 and hold whatever you don't need? It is likely to go up in value over time.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:46:09
If you have a significant amount use a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:15:52
Ledger Nano S - also a very good hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-08 06:44:01
This feature does work for me. It is currently set to 10 minutes.

How about putting a mining rig in space? It could have minimal reflective  heatsink fins, small battery for the short times away from the sun, very large solar array with sun tracking. Can't think how best to make sure it has uninterrupted Internet access. Inmarsat? It could be overclocked like crazy during time in earth's shade since heat will be a non issue. Likely some overclocking even in sunlight if it has the right materials on the outside.
Yes it would not be profitable anytime soon, but give it 10 years :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:29:08
Yes. A friend of mine just got one as well. Good way to use a little bitcoin where it is currently not accepted.
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:04:26
Get the Ledger Manager app for Chrome. Upgrade the firmware. Then install the individual wallet software to the device. Then use the Bitcoin Ledger chrome app. All of these steps will do attestation on it to make sure it is legitimate hardware. Any anomalies will be detected by the Ledger software.

@_date: 2017-06-18 00:45:06
Fair enough :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:05:37
Yea it is relatively safe. It stores your keys in the phone security module so getting the keys out is difficult. Not sure on the PIN length question but I think it will wipe the keys on too many attempts.
If you are really worried, get a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:30:03
The passphrase can be used to increase security of the written down 24 words. If someone gets your 24 words but they don't have the passphrase they can't simply sweep your wallet if you only use the wallet that is further derived from the passphrase and not the base wallet derivations.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:31:38
It shortens the life of the cards.
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:07:21
Electrum will work fine for that.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:59:05
This is the best answer. For not a lot of money you can buy a hardware wallet that will protect your keys from digital theft. Other options are ok if you plan to just play around with some "pocket change" for fun. If you have an amount of cryptocurrancy that is greater then an amount of fiat you would be comfortable carrying in your pocket in a bad part of town, then get a hardware wallet. I personally recommend a Ledger Nano S because it is easy to have on your keyring at all times and the security hardware is better. However, all the major ones out there are ok.
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:18:28
The Ledger can generate a new seed once the old one is compromised by using it on another device. It is best to temporarily move all your cryptocurrancy to someplace else before loading the seed on another device. Then do what you need to do to resolve your issue and reset the Ledger to generate a new seed. Backup the new seed and transfer your funds to the new wallet addresses from wherever you sent them.
I had to do something like this recently so I just bought a 2nd Ledger Nano S. Once completed I loaded the new seed to my old Ledger and reset the new one so I could keep it pristine in the box in case I ever break my current one.

@_date: 2017-06-12 10:01:00
Trezor is not a true HSM because it lacks a secure secondary processor that is resistant to physical attacks. It is, however, a "hardware wallet" and still much better then wallet software on PCs and other general purpose compute devices. 
If you want a true "hardware wallet" with all the properties of an HSM, get a Ledger Nano S. It has a dedicated chip that is resistant to physical attack. You know, that 0.00000001% chance thing that may happen to you ;)

@_date: 2017-06-17 23:32:55
Actually out of the 24 word seed the last word is the checksum :)
The passphrase, if used, acts like a 25th word.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:53:32
Several of my friends and I use Ledger Nano S hardware wallets. Very happy with them.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:05:08
Same as any other wallet except you have a device connected to your PC or phone.

Nicehash will mine other stuff and pay out in Bitcoin. Your single computer may not make more money then the electricity it uses but it should still be fun :)
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:29:32
Complete FUD. Unlike other hardware wallets the Ledger Nano S has a dedicated security chip that is just like an HSM (hardware security module) used by the credit card industry among other critical security applications. This makes it currently the most secure electronic device you can store your keys on. The vast majority of their code is open source.
If you don't trust it then don't buy one. Posting this shit just makes everyone worry about hardware wallets.
