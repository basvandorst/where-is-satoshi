I really think this opportunity needs to be pounced on ASAP.  This is a great chance to have bitcoin adopted as a way to purchase offline goods.  What we need are bitcoin ATMs popping up near or inside the legal marijuana stores and for those stores to accept bitcoin.  It would be worth someone starting an alternative to bitpay specifically for marijuana merchants.

I don't know if you've considered equity crowdfunding this project by releasing shares of some sort? (using cryptocurrency methods of course)  That's one way the community could help move this along.  You'd need to work on it full time then of course and have a team in place so it would change the structure of how this is run.

The author seems to think bitcoin is 'only' a currency and has no idea of all the amazing things the protocol can do.  He raises some important points about the very unequal distribution of bitcoins but there is such demmand for bitcoin world wide even if the super rich bitcoiners dumped large amounts of coins the market would soak it up and the problem would be fixed.  
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:30:44
It's inflating, i.e. new bitcoins are being mined, but that's just one (important) factor in the price.

Think about what bitcoin is going to be used for, the amazing features of the protocol.  Cryptocurrency isn't going away. Blockchains are here to stay say.  So investing in having a 'crypto portfolio' overall is definitely a good move.  As for buying bitcoins themselves, it makes sense to have some as part of the portfolio.  Some people prefer most or all of their crypto investment to simple be in bitcoins.  Others may prefer to invest in bitcoin related businesses or any crypto-related business, or maybe some altcoins.  So the real question is, should you invest in crypto now?  I say yes.  If you want to invest in crypto at all when the market is exploding into the world and will continue to explode for years it's best to just buy as soon as possible.  If you can afford to keep money invested bitcoin for at least 6 months it will probably be very profitable investment.  It's not worth buying any now if you will have to sell it within a few months as no one can easily predict what the price will do in the very short term.

I'm in favour of this idea, but I did read a tweet of his a while back where he said he was glad that he wasn't getting 'dragged in front' of the panel or something along those lines.

On the one hand bitcoin doesn't need to crowdfund publicity campaigns because it's makes headlines pretty much every day.  Maybe that is enough publicity?  Is there ever "enough"?
On the other hand, quite a lot of it that publicity is negative (but by no means all or even most).  It would benefit bitcoin's image for BTC to be raised for positive things.  Having said that, that has happened on many occasions.  But doing more of this can only help.
Also there's perhaps some apathy now that bitcoin is bigger, each individual donation proportionally will have less impact on the price than with a smaller coin, causing people to defer marketing responsibility to each other and not take any action themselves.
But there's no doubt in my mind that when a worthy cause which aligns with bitcoin's interest shows itself, it will get flooded with BTC donations, as has happened in the past.  Nevertheless, bitcoin will be fine whether or not such things are funded.  More serious groundwork is being layed out by increasingly competent and experienced entrepreneurs.  These kind of publicity stunts aren't all that important, but they are fun, beneficial for the world and for bitcoin so I all ears for ideas of which projects to fund.  Though maybe that money would be better spent on investing in equity-crowdfunding bitcoin businesses, as I stated at the start, maybe we have enough publicity at the moment?

While adding the extra payment option of bitcoin to the donation page may well cause a small decrease in fiat donations, I would expect that to be massively outweighed by the bitcoin donations.  We have a history of rapidly raising huge sums of money for what we deem worthy causes, and Wikipedia is one of them. Bitcoiners will donate more if you add us to the donation page as a real option, and I hope this is done.

Since when do we send bitcoins by sending people the private key lol?  She needs to create a bitcoin wallet and send him her bitcoin address.    Then she needs to sell them one way or another.  Localbitcoins.com works great, but make sure she sells to a seller who has a good rating with lots of buyers and make sure she uses 2 factor authentication on her account.  The buyer can buy them from her via UKBT.

I would definitely use this, but I don't think 10 cents is enough.  On itunes new movies cost £3.50 - £5, which seems expensive to me.  If it was £2 a movie or less (not low quality illegal streaming) and was easy to pay in bitcoin I would use that service.  For 10 cents the movie would surely be a low quality illegal stream that doesn't work half the time, I've had enough of that.

This is seriously amazing! I would have thought this to be big news (I'm not just randomly saying that for everything).  Did Google (as Youtube owners) 'enable' this recently or does it work without them having done anything?  Awesome way to promote bitcoin even if the reciever doesn't collect the tip, just be sure to mention "here's a bitcoin tip" to get the word bitcoin out there.  This is one of the great uses of bitcoin.  It's time we made bitcoin tipping common place.  It's a (nearly + often free) ad for bitcoin!
Edit:  Ok it's not big economically in terms of affecting bitcoin price but it's pretty damn cool and a great promotional tool for bitcoin.

I'd like to know what Andreas thinks about bitcoin leading to the development of a direct digital democracy, whether he think this is a good thing and if so how it could happen (different technical implementations) and when this could happen and where it would start (the idea is international but some countries or regions could 'sign up' before others).
Unpackng the question (+ more questions):
I envision a world of decentralized self-governance, where the whole world is connected with the Internet + blockchain technology with real world identities attached embedded in the blockchain so that there can be 1 person 1 vote.  Currently there can only be 'shareholder' voting on the blockchain, so at some point there will need to be a system developed where we can have our real world identities added, or at least a system that lets us only have 1 vote on an issue.  The system doesn't actually need to know anything else about us other than that we haven't voted twice on the same issue. Do you have any ideas on the best way to do this? (or is it unnecessary because the whole idea is not a good one?)  
It might be beneficial still to have the option of having our real world identities added so that we can chose whether to be anonymous or not (real world identities verified by the bitcoin network so other people can't pretend to be me). 
In a globally connected direct digital democracy system there would be global issues everyone gets to vote on and local issues that allow only local votes.  For example the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest I feel (as a UK citizen) I should have a vote on (although perhaps a less powerful vote than a local) because the climate change impact it will have, which affects me.  The system would evolve so everyone could make proposals and vote on them and we would still vote for candidates with relevant expertise and high moral standards to make a lot of the decisions, but the 'democratic density' of society would increase, a 'thicking of the matrix of freedom' so to speak.  I'm sure this can all be done using blockchain technology, but I'm not sure how exactly.  
When/if this system is up and running and large parts of the world are being run using this system then in unstable regions peace and democracy could essentially be 'beamed via satellite (or hot air ballon) into a region.  People could choose to sign up and stop fighting.  Giving people a viable way to solve their problems like this could prevent or stop wars in their tracks.  Of course it wont always work if there is a lot of hatred, but having a democratic software platform where people can organise their society and find out what the majority really wants without fear of reprisal due to being anonymous (but still only getting 1 vote per person per issue... somehow)  is an exciting prospect.
What does Andreas think of this kind of idea and how can bitcoin technology be used to create it?  Is he in favour of direct digital democracy or does he think the economy can  'run itself' once it's been fixed by bitcoin and the free market is allowed to flourish?
I am in favour of the existence of regulation and governments, but I want everyone to be a member of the government.  Regulation by the people, for the people.  
Thanks! :)

Once we get an identity system set up so you can have a public bitcoin address verified as attached to your 'real word' identity then this wont be a problem I don't think.  Politicians would then only be allowed to receive bitcoin donations from addresses attached to a known identity.  (this would be along side the existence of pseudonymous and/or completely anonymous bitcoin addresses)

"It's probably going to be flatlining at best, most likely dropping in the next year?"  Where did you get that?  I expect there to be another bubble or major rise starting in the next few months, 6 months at a stretch, or at the very worst and least likely case, towards a year away.  I don't think it's not going to well i the short term, I have no idea what it will do in the short term which is why I suggested to make sure it isn't a short term investment.  It's my honest opinion that investing in bitcoin is a great educational experience and that it also is a good time to buy.

They could accept bitcoin as payment for Google Adsense and have the option for publishers to receive their payments in bitcoin.

Bitcoin's volatility is solved for the merchants by bitpay, coinbase etc, but not very well solved yet for consumers other than with centralised solutions (coinapult) that undermine the whole point of Bitcoin.

The amounts are probably too small, tipping 9 or 10 cents isn't enough to make anyone interested.  I'd say it needs to be more like $1 or more, say $1.11.

This is great but it's still cheaper and easier to use local bitcoins and just do a bank transfer.

I'm curious where the exchange rate is coming from and whether it can be brought down to be competitive with localbitcoin rates in the future.

Looks interesting.  A few questions for anyone who cares to answer:
- Do safecoins have their own 'competing' blockchain? 
- Can this or will this same service be able to be done the on bitcoin blockchain (eventually or already) such as by using Sidechains if it is ever implemented?  If so what is the likely timeframe for a 'pure' bitcoin development of this? 
- What are the other ways to do this (competition)?  Etherium?  Sidechains?  Annother Alt coin?

Not a good idea, this will just make store owners associate bitcoin with someone who illegally stuck promotion on their windows without permission.

The problem of bitcoin blockchain storage (i.e. being a node) could be solved soon via Maidsafe.  Maidsafe is a system where Proof of Storage is the proof of work and is part of a system that incentivises users to offer their spare disk space to store encrypted 'chunks' of data from other people, which would result decentralised cloud containing thousands of bitcoin nodes.  Still, in the immediate term it helps to become a node 'the old fashioned way' as explained in the OP.

@_date: 2014-04-20 08:43:01
I think the reason so few have donated is because everyone thinks Ross has a ton of bitcoins stashed somewhere.  I saw the appeal by his Mother who claimed he hardly has any money  and his sister here certainly doesn't behave like he has a fortune in bitcoins, and I don't believe they are deliberately hiding anything.  They seem like very nice people.  I know the FBI were able to get access and "confiscate" some of them but was that all of them?  You'd think he would keep such a large amount in separate wallets.  Details are needed.    
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:08:34
Storing coins on Blockchain.info is not as safe as cold/offline storage.  They are not insured, your account can be hacked and the bitcoins stolen.  Generally it's a bad idea to keep any large amount of bitcoins in a wallet on a website like that.  It's ok for small amounts as long as you use 2 factor authentication.  Think of wallets like blockchain.info or other wallets at online exchanges like a wallet only for spending or trading, but not a bank account.  Large amounts should be kept offline in cold storage.  What qualifies as 'large' is obviously entirely in the eye of the beholder.

No one has ever lost on bitcoin who held for over 1 year.  Seeing as we are far from the peak of the last 'bubble phase', both in time and price (price is down by 2 thirds) I'd say it's a great time to buy, but I'd only ever advise buying bitcoin if you can hold for at least 1 year, regardless of whether the price goes up or down during that time.  2 years would be an even safer bet.  The longer you're prepared to hold the safer the investment is.

Why does that barrier of entry to run a masternode need to be so high?
@_date: 2014-04-19 12:47:51
Centralization mining is a serious potential threat to bitcoin but it's not a failure automatically if it occurs.  It makes the network more vulnerable to attacks, such as owners of the mining equipment being co-erced into attacking the network (they're unlikely to attack it themselves as explained in my previous comment).  But no one knows how this will play out.  If an additional proof of work that was thoroughly tested and gained the support of the mining community (I don't mine) and there was a hard fork I would probably support it but the video was just blowing the threat way out of proportion.
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:10:19

This looks like potentially the 'killer app' that makes bitcoin physically easier to spend in stores than using a debit/credit card!  Of course buying the bitcoins can still be a hassle, but this is an important development imo.

Thank you for doing this.  Hoping you can answer a quick question of mine:
What if I bought 100BTC at $10, then sold half of them at $1000 per BTC.  Then before the tax year was over I reinvested that gain into stocks, such as Google or Amazon shares and left it there so there is no realised gain at the end of the tax year.  Do I have to pay any tax on that?
@_date: 2014-06-03 10:37:53
I thought the problem with darkcoin is the centralization of masternodes. It costs 1000DRK to run a masternode. With darkcoin at at $10 thats $10,000 required to run a masternode. It's currently at an even higher price than that! If it reaches $100 then that will be $100,000 to run a masternode. Impossible for almost everyone, resulting in centralised mixing services at severely reduced (or completely broken) anonymity. Anyone care to explain why I'm wrong?
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:05:42

It costs more to transfer money there.
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:30:20
1 bitUSD has the value of $1 so it has the advantage of not needing to rush to sell to avoid volatility.  It can be safely stored as bitUSD indefinitely and it will still be worth $1 years from now (and actually earns a small amount of interest while held as bitUSD).  If I was a youtuber I'd prefer bitUSD over bitcoin.  I'm not sure how the transaction fees compare with bitcoin but there's not much difference. (i.e. almost none).
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:20:32
Bitcoin is not the cure for war.  It stops inflation as a funding method which is great, but the price of fighting a war is going to drop dramatically with 3D printed guns and other 3D printed weapons.  What happens when you can 3D print a robot to carry a gun and is programmed to kill everyone within a certain area?  What happens when everyone can 3D print mini drones and build their own robotic army at low cost?  The consequences are unimaginable but almost certainly won't result in peace, and so I think it's nonsense that merely by cutting the current primary funding method of wars - inflationary fiat, will cure them in the long term, and it's not every 100% certain that bitcoin will do that (although it seems pretty likely).  
Also before fiat was removed from the gold standard there were tons of wars.  
Finally, calling bitcoin a 'humanitarian project' when it's humanitarian benefits are hypothetical and the personal profit is guaranteed is verging on delusional.

math1985, This is about building a direct democracy.  It's about allowing people to vote on policy directly in some cases, and for massively broader range of voting options for candidates for all sorts of positions, enriching the quality of the democracy.  It's about giving people much more say in politics than they currently have.  For example the majority wouldn't have voted to to war or to go and drop bombs on a bunch of middle eastern countries for no apparent reason.  That kind of despotic action can be prevented by giving people the power which they are supposed to have over their own government.  In a direct democracy, the government consists of all the people.  The benefits of this are endless.

What we need is a way to equity crowd fund albums, which requires a change in the law of most countries as well as the completion of the development of colored coins.

Could whoever is down voting me please explain why?  If I'm wrong about this potential feature I want to know... If we want to be able to use bitcoin to eventually create a direct digital democracy (which many of us do) there will need to be 'public' addresses attached to our real word identity to allow each person to have one vote.  What I'm saying here is that this could first be used for campaign contributions.

Interesting observations.  Bitcoin may fit the label of a cult of some kind, must that be a bad thing? Red Dwarf is often described as having a 'cult' following, so are many other books and movies.  Also Bitcoin's only dogma is the code and that can be modified and it doesn't make any supernatural claims and a lot of bitcoiners (maybe most) don't care about Satoshis values and are just here to speculate.

So, people would 'mine' music instead of coins? So when a block is mined rather than getting coins the miner recieves MP3 files or some other media?

Here is an explanation:
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:41:02
If you need 1000DRK to run a master node and 1DRK costs $10 then you need $10,000 to run a master node.  That's a high barrier to entry, and if darkdcoin succeeds that will become more and more expensive.  If Darkcoin reaches $100 you will need $100,000 to run a masternode.  Impossible for most of us.  Isn't that a pretty big problem as that results in there being fewer and fewer masternodes the more popular Darkcoin is, which could then be more easily shut down or compromised?

If you've done lots of research and are confident in bitcoin as an investment and if you are prepared to be patient and resist the temptation to sell if it goes down I'd say go for it. It's a pretty good time to buy, but you never can get it quite right.  I'd advise all bitcoin buyers to be prepared to hold their coins for at least 1 year (2 years would be even better) and not expect to make any gains until then.  It will be an emotionally intense experience and a very educational one I'm sure in many other ways.

I'd like to know what Andreas thinks about bitcoin leading to the development of a direct digital democracy, whether he think this is a good thing and if so how it could happen (different technical implementations) and when this could happen and where it would start (the idea is international but some countries or regions could 'sign up' before others).
Unpackng the question (+ more questions):
I envision a world of decentralized self-governance, where the whole world is connected with the Internet + blockchain technology with real world identities attached embedded in the blockchain so that there can be 1 person 1 vote.  Currently there can only be 'shareholder' voting on the blockchain, so at some point there will need to be a system developed where we can have our real world identities added, or at least a system that lets us only have 1 vote on an issue. The system doesn't actually need to know anything else about us other than that we haven't voted twice on the same issue. Do you have any ideas on the best way to do this? (or is it unnecessary because the whole idea is not a good one?)
It might be beneficial still to have the option of having our real world identities added so that we can chose whether to be anonymous or not (real world identities verified by the bitcoin network so other people can't pretend to be me).
In a globally connected direct digital democracy system there would be global issues everyone gets to vote on and local issues that allow only local votes. For example the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest I feel (as a UK citizen) I should have a vote on (although perhaps a less powerful vote than a local) because the climate change impact it will have, which affects me. The system would evolve so everyone could make proposals and vote on them and we would still vote for candidates with relevant expertise and high moral standards to make a lot of the decisions, but the 'democratic density' of society would increase, a 'thicking of the matrix of freedom' so to speak. I'm sure this can all be done using blockchain technology, but I'm not sure how exactly.
When/if this system is up and running and large parts of the world are being run using this system then in unstable regions peace and democracy could essentially be 'beamed via satellite (or hot air ballon) into a region. People could choose to sign up and stop fighting. Giving people a viable way to solve their problems like this could prevent or stop wars in their tracks. Of course it wont always work if there is a lot of hatred, but having a democratic software platform where people can organise their society and find out what the majority really wants without fear of reprisal due to being anonymous (but still only getting 1 vote per person per issue... somehow) is an exciting prospect.
What does Andreas think of this kind of idea and how can bitcoin technology be used to create it? Is he in favour of direct digital democracy or does he think the economy can 'run itself' once it's been fixed by bitcoin and the free market is allowed to flourish?
I am in favour of the existence of regulation and governments, but I want everyone to be a member of the government. Regulation by the people, for the people.
Thanks! :)

Nice research!  Yes you are correct BTC38 accepts bitCNY as if it were real CNY and actually gives a small bonus for bitCNY depositors! 
A BTC/BTS gateway is under active development:
The first gateways are coming online soon (in a few months there should be a bunch of them).  At the moment the way into the system is with BTS from bter or btc38, but that will soon change.

BitShares is decentralised, it can't be shut  down and automates the exchange process.  I am aware you believe otherwise.  Why not try and become a delegate yourself?  If you provide reliable service you could get voted in.    
BitShares gateways can just be individual people like on localbitcoins, except trading on a decentralised exchange.

I live in the UK.  Can I send bitcoins to trade on your exchange if I only want to withdraw bitcoins again after making a few trades? (not withdrawing any fiat).  If so, what information do you need from me, if any?

Oh right I see where your coming form, I'm not familiar with the double "==" meaning.
That's pretty hypothetical and impossible to enforce.

Once the asset is issued on BitShares if the issuer didn't select the 'superadmin' (lets call it) powers, they can't change it back.
So a BitShares UIA issuer can be fully compliant with KYC/AML even without having the ability to de-authorize users or confiscate funds from afar.  
And that superadmin power is there for other issuers who want it.
@_date: 2014-01-22 13:28:06
Nice!  I wonder if HMRC will have made up it's mind about what bitcoins are by then?  Hope there wont be VAT on every trade... 
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:30:59
Is this the answer? Please read and understand before up/down voting.
It all be done entirely within the BitShares client - no central exchange website even needed.
Example: Bitstamp could announce it is now a BitShares gateway and provide bank account deposit details on its wall on its BitShares account. People could start making fiat deposits, lets say in Euros to Bitstamp's bank account. Bitstamp issues them bitstampEUR, which is an IOU for EUROs from Bitstamp. 
This IOU issued on the BitShares blockchain is equivalent to EUROs on an exchange, which are not actual EUROs but just an IOU from the exchange. The buyer can now trade Bitstamps IOU against any bitasset bitUSD, bitCNY, bitGOLD, bitSilver, bitOil etc.
People who want to sell their bitEUR, bitBTC or any bitasset for real EUROs buys the IOU from Bitstamp depositors if they trust Bitstamp as a gateway, which is like buying and holding EUROs on the Bitstamp website except they are held in a decentralised crypto client.
They can then send Bitstamp the IOU (BitstampEUR) with a memo including their bank account details to redeem the IOU. Bitstamp would then send them EUROs from their bank account.
If the person who bought the BitstampEUR changed their mind and wanted to sell it back to EUROs, they could send it back to Bitstamp and Bitstap would send them 100 EUROs from their bank account (minus a tiny exchange fee).
Thus a fiat-crypto exchange like a localbitcoins within a decentralised client exists in BitShares. (Bitstamp is not yet a BitShares gateway, this is just an example).

Interesting and generally well researched piece.  I want to correct one error about BitShares.  The author said:
"Many today are misguidedly building systems that violate this “cash” principle. For example, the BitShares blog explicitly promises that their gateways (currency issuers) have the ability to freeze or confiscate funds from afar:
1) Ability to white-list public keys that may control a balance of your asset.
2) Ability to freeze all funds and stop all trading of your assets.
3) Ability to transfer any balance of your asset from any user to any other user.
These are dangerous powers, and they place a very heavy liability—the same as that suffered by e-gold—onto the gateways (currency issuers) in the BitShares system."
These powers are optional in BitShares.  A issuer of an asset can chose issue their asset with or without having these powers.  This means BitShares can do what the author is a proponent of - asset issuance that is not under the control of the issuer (the "cash" principle) as well as allowing regulatory compliance for gateways that need it.  BitShares can do both.  See here Daniel Larimer (aka bytemaster) explains that they are optional powers:
Otherwise, a thought provoking piece.﻿

It depends on what caused the price rise.  If it rose suddenly in a spike and seemed based on speculator confidence increasing, but not much actual growth of the bitcoin economy, i.e. a mini bubble, then I would sell at a certain price with the aim of re-buying back in again when the bubble bursts.  
If I woke up tomorrow morning and the price was $100 per bitcoin I would sell, unless there was news to back up that price rise like a country adopting bitcoin as their national currency (which it isn't anywhere near ready for anyway as far as I understand...).  
The more slowly it grows the more likely it is to keep on growing, so if it gradually increased up to $100 over say, 2 years, I may well keep my money in as it's looking pretty stable and likely to increase further.

I don't believe that funding "a small number of people who knew enough about bitcoin to invest early" is worse than "supporting statist governments".  
While it is possible these super-early adopters include some vial immoral beings who will waste their riches on personal pleasure (and there's a good chance of that given the corrupting power money has over us); the current situation of wealth inequality in the world and war is utterly unacceptable, and quite frankly, it's worth trying to tilt it into a new balance it even if that way isn't perfect.  Lets see what happens when the balance of power is dramatically shifted.
If bitcoin ever stabilizes (say in 5 years at $5000 per bitcoin) it could save us.  People living in countries ravaged by hyeper-inflation from their governments and bankers being in bed together will be able to take on the bitcoin and use it as a stable currency to trade with, trading with customers world wide (after loosing much of their wealth first of course).  Think what this could do to the countries who paypal blocks access to and banks wont deal with.  All who have internet connection will be able to trade in the global marketplace paid in a currency everyone accepts everywhere.
Bitcoin is one step closer to uniting the World.
Disclosure:  I am invested in BTC, LTC and PPC.

We could have a little slide down but not more than a couple of weeks, remember the 'crash' whatever you want to call it happened because of too many people wanting to buy bitcoins causing massive lagg at Mtgox.  
The BTC market is in in 'wait and see' mode for now, people will be pilling back in as soon as they get bored of waiting.  It's like the market is 'dormant'.  There could well be a downward slide, until some massive news puts everyone back into bull mode.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:27:42
Well as an bitcoin investor and ideological bitcoin enthusiast I would definitely say adding bitcoins as payment option is a good idea.  That surely is just a good business decision.  
Being bitcoin *only* however could turn away lots of your potential customers, but it could also draw new ones from bitcoin users, and will help bitcoins.  It would also mean you end up with a lot of bitcoins so if you think they are going to keep going up maybe that's worth it?  
All depends on how invested you want to be in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:24:59
You could talk about how it's for anyone anywhere in the world,  including people in 'third World' countries where paypal and banks don't do business. 
You could talk about currencies that are being devalued by inflation such as the Argentinean Peso and bitcoin stepping up as a store of value and means of exchange. (it needs more time + growth to be a 'safe store of value' but it could be in the future).
You could talk about it's potential to result in a change in the devastating drug policies.  
You could talk about it being a currency of the World, transcending national boundaries.
Bitcoin brings us one step closer to being a truly United Nation!

My guess is that there will be many minor corrections of a few dollars  in the next 1-2 months, but it will recover from each one quickly and keep going up past $30 maybe up to $50.  Maybe there will be a larger correction of about $10-$12 in that time period but it won't take long to recover, and a (moderately) larger correction like this happening in say 3 weeks may not take it to below the current price.

It will either go to way up and way down and die, or way up and then reach relative stability much higher than the current price, for a while anyway, but who really knows.  If it's "successful" whatever that means I would imagine a more stable price will be achieved.  Although I already consider it a very successful experiment.

No you can do it via bank transfer.  They make an account, click on 'sell bitcoins' then find one from your country (should appear automatically) with a good rating.  Then they click sell and message the buyer with their bank account details (name, sort code, account number, at least thats what you need in the UK) and then they release the bitcoins into localbitcoins escrow.  Then when the payment arrives in their bank account (should happen very soon after the buyer sends it, but the buyer may take a little while to send it) they click 'release coins from escrow' and the bitcoins are released to the buyer.

Why not have them create a localbitcoins account and send it there?  Then they can sell it for Euros without having to get verified or anything, and often for a slightly better price.

The Internet is a big place, regardless of my ever growing fondness for Bitcoin (which I have 80% of all my money invested in) I think LTC should be kept a careful eye on by bitcoiners.  It's actually FAR easier to buy LTC with BTC than it is to get BTC!  In some countries it especially easy as getting BTC (for a good price) isn't easy easy in the UK.  
 
Analogy:  There is a permeable membrane between BTC/LTC and fiat/BTC  There is no fiat/LTC membrane and the BTC/LTC membrane is considerably more permiable than fiat/BTC.  Therefore, money will move from BTC -&gt; LTC, as well as from fiat -&gt;BTC.  Also money can move from LTC -&gt; BTC.  The question is, will BTC rise faster than LTC making it not worth buying any?

No way, not with silk road - it's massive, it has thousands of sellers, and then satoshi dice, bit pay, bitcoinstore etc, there's an economy of trade underneath that would keep the price well above $30, and not all the speculators would flee.

True, there is still SEPA, for which they a pretty outrageous fee, (£15 for barclays) and they've still shut down the Mtgox account and others.  Surely shutting down accounts restricts free trade?  I would say that counts as abusive behavior by a firm dominating a market.

I think right now is a fairly good time to invest.  We just had a dip and so when we next return to $30+ it will be with increased confidence that some of the people who planned to sell at that point have now sold and some 'pressure has been let out of the system' so to speak.  
Having said that, we do need a constant stream of announcements of bitcoins progress for this growth to be maintained, and it could be a slow few months in terms of new big bitcoin news, who knows, it could be great.  But I think waiting and hoping for it to go down is more of a risk, even though big dips are perfectly possible.  Medium-long term we are surely going up, maybe by a huge amount. Buy and hold I say.
P.S. I bought in at $14 and $24

Can I use transferwise to take money OUT of Bitstamp and back into my GBP account?  
I used it to turn GBP into EUR which it then sends to Bitstamp which converts the EUR into USD to to buy BTC, but now I want to to the same thing but in reverse.  I.e. Sell some BTC on bitstamp into USD, then use transferwise to get it back into my GBP account.  Will this work?

I'm quite surprised actually by all the advice to sell here, as if this could be the highest price bitcoin will reach in the next few months.  Yes, it could pop down to $60 or something but as always it would quickly recover, only end up much higher not that long after the big dip.  If it halved overnight tonight I wouldn't freak out, despite having 80% of my money in BTC (plus a little bit in LTC), because I know it would recover and in a few months probably be at $200, maybe in a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-08-03 17:32:23

I'm just holding though all of this. I'm confident about bitcoin's future so why risk trying to predict the peaks and falls?  If I had more money to invest I would place a buy order around the mid-upper thirties as there may well be another 'bigish' dip and recovery or two before breaking $50.

It could crash to half its current value and you'd get more, but if your going to be filthy rich, which every who buys some BTC at this stage almost definitely will be, I wouldn't risk waiting.  If I had more money I'd put it all in now and would keep buying all the way up to $1000.

Maybe they just get some of their highest traffic on their bitcoin articles and so keep releasing more?  
Or maybe there's people who control these press releases who are invested in bitcoin and by (ordering the) publishing of more stories gain themselves 'insider information' on news releases which cause a temporary price increase, which they can then profit massively from knowing it was going to happen.
Maybe both?
Maybe neither?  I don't know.

How about almost free transactions?  for businesses this is a huge offering, how about 'can't be seized by the government', i.e. you actually own your money, how about, isn't invested and thus supports corrupt banks that are above the law?

Ok I'm not sure about the currency exchange fees, it was well over a year ago when I did a Sepa transfer to bitstamp using transferwise (before they were forced not to process transactions to bitstamp) who guaranteed extremely low exchange fees.

I understand the definition of tax is what you are saying, but hear me out.  The US government is controlled to a very large extent by lobbying groups and corporate interest.  It's not far out conspiracy, it's pretty common knowledge.  The traditional viewpoint you espouse only makes sense if you think we are living in a democracy where there is a legitimate government.  If the democratic process has been subverted by campaign contributions, bribes and business connections between politicians and industry, resulting in the government being largely illegitimate (to a large but not complete extent, it's not a black and white issue), which is what I am claiming here, then that throws into question, is what you are calling taxation actually legitimate taxation?  Perhaps illegitimate taxation is still taxation, but I say its better to look at the broader picture and include facts such as the fed being a private bank that creates money as debt.  We pay taxes to whomever controls us, and I am arguing that it's not congress or politicians that control us, but banks and corporations, which control politicians.  I'm not saying these influencers gather and form some kind of secret government, that would be ridiculous.  I'm making a philosophical point. I know strictly in legal speak inflation is not tax.  I am not disputing that.  I am expanding to a philosophical argument about the hierarchy of society, and saying that the order of this hierarchy is not as it was intended, which brings into dispute what tax is and whether what I am calling illegitimate tax is still tax at all.

If I have a backup of Bitcoin QT on an external hard drive and update the backup every time I sync bitcion QT using Time Machine on Mac, that's pretty secure right?  My external harddrive isn't on the internet, it's just plugged into my lapop via USB so it can't be hacked... but then the bitcoins are stored in QT on my laptop... so I'm not sure... If my coins are stolen via hacking from bitcoin qt (which is encrypted with a difficult password), will my backup version be able to recover them?

I have a question.  If I buy a cheap netbook and use Armoury wallet as an offline wallet on that (as well as creating a paper wallet), can I create a 'watch only' wallet on blockchain?  I know I can create a 'watch only' wallet on my macbook in armoury but as far as I understand it requires the downloading of the entire blockchain, so if I can create a 'watch only' wallet on blockchain that would be much better.  Thanks

I think the video fails to explain the huge potential of coloured coins adequately. The amazing thing about Coloured coins is that they will allow anyone to have an 'IPO'.  Any website, entrepreneur, artist will be able to issue shares, and just as importantly, it allows anyone to buy them.  
Usually to issue shares publicly you have to be a big company and only accredited investors can invest, but this gives the little guy a chance to play, and there are a lot of us little guys. :)
Its potential is huge!  Not only that but it uses the bitcoin blockchain while causing very little 'blockchain bloat' and so is very secure.  It makes bitcoin 100x more useful, and so will increase its value and adoption rate dramatically.
If you have 1000s of bitcoins and want to raise their value long term, the best way to do it is to offer a bounty to developers to develop coloured coins.

Coloured coins aren't something guaranteed to happen unless more developers decide to work on it.  I hope they do because it will be brilliant for anyone to be able to issue shares for their own website, business, art project etc in such a secure way, while also giving bitcoin another amazing use, which will make it even more valuable.  
I'm not sure about your point of it reducing the supply of bitcoins slightly, but it sounds like it could potentially.
@_date: 2013-08-03 14:27:56
Shorter term = harder to predict, longer term = easier to predict.  I have no idea whether we are going up or down next week, probably both.  But I expect the price to wobble between $70 and $130 for a couple more months at least before breaking $150 again.  I also expect we will see $70 before we see $130, but I'm not at all sure about that.  We may see $150 by the end of the year.  End of next year I'd expect to be $200+.  Each year after that my guess is it will be up $100 per year on average approximately, with crazy bubbles growing and popping along the way.  I've been in since $12.

This is normal, it goes up really fast then goes back down about 2 thirds of that climb, then up a third, then settles for a few days.  This time it's just gone up faster than usual so has more correcting to do.  Even if we go down another $50 we'll be back around this price in a week, and if we stay around $200 we'll be back around $250 by the end of next week. Maybe much sooner.

We don't need to do anything to get Amazon to accept Bitcoin, just wait a year or two and they'll have to start accepting it due to so many potential customers wanting to spend it and due to the huge credit card fees they will save.  It's inevitable, unless something kills bitcoin.

Inflation is a tax because the government are supposed to be in control, i.e. they are supposed to govern, but the government is not in control, so they are not really the government, even though we still call them that.  The banks, corporations and super wealthy elite are the real governors and inflation makes them richer and the poor poorer.  Therefore the real government is raising taxes via inflation.  It's also known as robbery.

I think so, I don't need a huge amount to be happy and useful to the world.  I suffer from CFS/ME (chronic fatigue syndrome) and if I had several thousand to spend on therapy I could possibly greatly improve my health.  I got a lot better when visiting a friend who lives by the Mediterranean sea, I think the gentle swimming in the sea + lying on the beach in the sun helped me a lot. (there are some possible medical explanations I won't bother going into).   If I could afford to do that for a few months there's a chance I would improve a lot and get my life back - I'm currently very debilitated.  
If that happened and I got better (which is possible) and I had another twenty thousand or so I would be able to afford to live independently for long enough to home-record my first album - I am a music composer and producer, but have been to ill to produce finished tracks... despite having dozens written and an endless flow of inspiration, all held back by my damn illness.  
My 'ultimate dream' would require my health and a few hundred thousand to buy my own land and live sustainably growing much of my own food in a peacefull place near some woods or even in the woods.  I would happily live like this recording my music and writing the odd fantasy or science fiction novel (which I started before my illness).  I would hope to become successful in time and make much more money which I would donate to worthy projects like 'Eradicate Ecocide' and possibly start some philanthropic endeavor of my own.  Something like 'liquid democracy' like the German pirate party have developed, or like Iceland's crowd-sourced constitution.  It would be a web project aiming to make society more democratic in a much more advance and better way.  So I don't really need much money for this to happen.

And he suddenly remembered the Gom Jabbar, stress-testing his bene-gesserit programming.  There were too many bitcoins for his nerd-awareness to handle.

I feel the bitcoin market is 'biding it's time'... It will stay like this for a little while, at least over this weekend, maybe a couple or maybe even a few weeks after that.  Maintaining this price will require a continuous steady supply of 'standard bitcoin related news' where nothing new is really announced but RT,huffpost etc do a pieces on it like they have done. Then there will be some massive news and it will start zooming up again.  The longer it stays stable now the less likely there is to be a crash later on.  I'm happy for it to stay like this for a while.
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:20:20
Yes I simply meant 'we the bitcoin community' know this and so do bitcoin developers.  As others have said here there's Ripple, there's an exchange Max Keiser is talking about setting up in London, there's Mtgox + coinbase partership (I think is still happening?), there are even proposals on bitcointalk of p2p exchanges using the 'darknet', and the eye of venture capitalists has been drawn who will inevitably get more + better changes up and running.  I'm saying you are right, exchanges are the weak spot of bitcoin, and that problem can and is being fixed, but more talk about it is good too! :)
