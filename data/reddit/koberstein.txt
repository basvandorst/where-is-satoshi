Here is some information for you:
@_date: 2015-06-01 04:02:32
I will be fine.
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:03:34
Thank you for doing the due diligence.  I am also growing tired of the spin hype.
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:22:58
They already are.  They are just not buying them on exchanges.

To anybody considering doing such an operation in the US...  here is where you do it:

20MB blocks aren't going to happen for a while.  The maximum block size is potentially going to be raised.  This doesn't mean that the blocks will immediately be 20MB each.
@_date: 2015-06-01 04:02:32
I will be fine.
@_date: 2015-06-11 05:24:02
Yes, it is information and not evidence.
It would make sense if that was what is going on.
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:41:25
Nope.  You know a koberstein?  Rare name.

This begs the question:  who pays the price of the widespread financial fraud that goes on every day?
On the surface, it appears that the user pays nothing because they are reimbursed by the financial institution.  But, where are those US dollars coming from?  I think everybody pays the price on some level seeing as we are all participating in this economic system that is obviously flawed from a macro perspective.

I do not believe that the posted link is not unrelated...
The github user "daftspunk" is apparently sending ChangeTips on GitHub.

I believe the author wants us to write about the future in past-tense.
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:03:46
"past performance does not guarantee future results"
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:02:27
the idea was not satoshi's alone
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:46:30
Maybe this has been going on since before it became unprofitable?

I don't know if Robocoin is officially "from" Reno but they have people working here:  
@_date: 2014-06-04 00:05:45
One problem with this is that a big player like Spotify could blow your business out of the water if they chose to implement Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-23 03:24:41
Rad.  If you like this sort of thing, check out earthship biotecture and the documentary "garbage warrior".  Taos seems like an interesting place.
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:49:15
Very interesting!
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:41:33
Well yeah, I mean... who reads ZDNet?  Somebody is paying for it.
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:08:05
Yeah I believe they got forced out of their old location because they widened Moana.
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:43:50
Same reason that I purchase btc to spend on overstock.com
To support the growth of bitcoin infrastructure.
Yes, this is not a good enough reason for most consumers but to me, it is all the reason I need.
Secondarily, I do appreciate the fact that it makes one less company in posession of my credit card number.
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:18:12
How so?
Have you any insight into the logistical complexities of launching a product of that scale?
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:57:37
They're all afraid to be seen as crazy or fringe.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:31:54
Insiders knew who won.
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:21:49
I assume that if you run a website that accepts bitcoin, it is easier and arguably more secure to use a 3rd party service than to provide your own implementation.
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:00:31
I could see this working if they partnered up with coinbase and had some kind of recurring payment option with optional  automatic buyback.  I like that I pay a monthly fee for netflix that just keeps getting charged and netflix is always available when needed.  The last thing I would want is to have to remember to pay my netflix bill.  I know i know, first world problems...  but these are busy times in a fast paced world.  I would imagine that the majority of consumers would agree.... recurring payments or this doesnt work for me.

well, right now, i suppose the video of the live presentation is more important than how the live presentation went down in the moment.
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:15:50
Such an app already exists.  It is called CoinPlanter.
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:55:10
Sidenote:  I do agree that it is dangerous to declare coinbase the defacto centralized store of btc.  As has been said before... treat it like checking and save your savings coin in cold storage.  I appreciate the service they provide and all they are doing as a company but will never put all my eggs in that basket.

you might want to check out how digitalocean does its knowledgebase for good inspiration :)
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:24:48
Have a look at the way  works - instead of having a typical monthly subscription, you can pay for any amount of time.  So, when you want more time - you just send more btc...
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:15:50
Of course they arent approving all bitcoin apps.  They dont approve all apps of any kind.
@_date: 2014-06-04 00:09:07
Sidenote:  perhaps it is possible to seamlessly integrate bitcoin tipping into spotify using their API?

In my opinion, the changetip website needs a redesign.  Give it a more custom / less bootstrap template look and the conversion rate would improve.
@_date: 2014-10-10 21:32:10
Yeah, I imagine so as well and would not do so without permission.
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:32:19
I would imagine it could soon be possible but also would imagine that there would be a more profitable way to use such AI.
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:19:44
Every innovation is built on multiple previous innovations.
@_date: 2014-06-04 00:25:06
Looks doable.  The API looks very web based.  Probably would be about as technically difficult as making a chrome extension.  The only thing I was concerned with is authenticating the artist so that they can collect tips but it looks like artists are associated to users and this association is easily determined.... hmmmm might have to make some time.
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:03:59
Settle down.
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:22:01
Do the math and then decide
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:47:47
I would have said the same thing until I learned about Bitshares
@_date: 2014-10-10 19:38:26
I had an idea:
1)  Get 1:10 DVD replicator
2)  Make many copies
3)  Label DVD with title of film and donation address QR code
4)  Disperse them around my city
Do you think the creator of the film would object?

Nearly every large scale website on the internet uses a CDN.  This is nothing to lose sleep over.

"I have used it for legal things"
@_date: 2014-11-12 03:41:34
Cool, good to hear.  Yes, I would hate it if CL revamped everything overnight as I am so used to it.  The difference between CL and changetip is that CL earned their household name status at a time when their design wasn't outdated.  Whereas, changetip's design ( not the underying service ) looks a lot like a site that was recently built in a weekend;  thus grouping them together with scammy sites that were recently built in a weekend.  Perception is a huge component of the game.
@_date: 2014-10-13 05:13:43
true.  but, no wealth manager would put 100% of their clients' money into any one investment - especially bitcoin.  i would imagine that wealth managers are interested in putting very small percentages into investments with very high growth potential.  thus, the potential appeal of bitcoin in such a situation.

Ouch embarassing bug
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:55:13
Hey, let's all complain about free bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:02:36
Or, a hacker could just get you to click a link to a website...
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:11:33
I was watching Jackie Brown the other night and realized that bitcoin would have negated the whole plot :p
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:06:05
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:52:27
Because it is a mockup of an idea not implemented yet.
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:36:03
How is the world "richer today than ever before"?
What exactly is "the wealth of the earth" if measured in USD?
Such silly metrics.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:22:45
I wonder how he plans on pegging a digital currency's value to that of a local currency.
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:42:39
Correct, this would not be easy for you to try.
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:13:23
It would have been nice if they would have let users from states that cannot use the exchange at least be able to see the exchange interface with just the buy/sell feature disabled...
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:16:17
To premine 1,000,000 units of the new global currency then hyperinflate the USD in order to pay off the trade deficit.

The fewer assumptions you have to make, the less room for error there is.  This assumption is not true in their feed.
From my experience, you want to keep type conversion to a minimum.  Data that goes from a numeric type (int / float / etc) then... converted to a string... then back to numeric type... creates points of failure.
Companies like Stripe denominate in cents instead of dollars (  ).  You can't put the decimal point in the wrong place.  Remember Office Space?  "I always mess up some mundane detail...."
@_date: 2015-08-13 22:36:07
Technically they are not using floats but strings that represent floats.  That can really be a nightmare to deal with.  I would have denominated in Satoshis, an integer value.
@_date: 2015-07-16 15:03:48
I had a Computer Science professor that was an expert in neural networks but had the worst website ever made.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case with Satoshi...
@_date: 2015-08-07 04:35:08
I can't help but thinking of the song "Lord of Overstock"
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:19:40
Exactly.  So tired of people beating the dead horse on this.  Nobody is stopping anybody from creating an alternative.
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:00:26
That is not how probability works.
@_date: 2015-11-12 16:29:13
Yeah man, freedom of press.
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:49:28
Yeah, I think bitcoin is much more appealing to the dev crowd than the design crowd at this point.
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:27:50
No, but AsparagusCoin can.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:29:36
The plot sickens.

Sounds awesome!  Have you heard of barnraiser (  )?  They dont currently have Bitcoin integration but they are a cool platform for fundraising projects like yours and may be open to it.  Keep up the good work!
