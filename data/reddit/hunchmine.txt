Hmmm. 
I don’t really see greed in this. 
I see an individual tired of the corporate greed. 
I see someone sick if the income inequality 
I see someone sick of the status quo
I see someone who realized the potential in  a global marketplace. 
I don’t see greed here guys. 
I see an opportunity in its prime. 
I see infinite possibilities, and so does @_date: 2018-01-27 05:44:25
If you’re adjusting for local pricing models, and correlate the data with the figures coming in from alternate exchanges, you’ll see that the analysis clearly indicates the inverse of your assessment, and a trend toward an equilibrium seems on the horizon in the not too distant future, albeit with some time to wait in between. 
Even though this happens to be a period of minor corrections, you can look at the historical conditions of performance, to gauge the current investment environment, and adjust your execution strategy accordingly 
And if none of that makes sense to you then good, and it shouldn’t, because it’s nonsense, and most people feel that way about all of this at the moment. ������ 
Keep researching, and asking though... 
take everything with a grain of salt and DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE!!! 
I wish you the absolute best my friend!
Cheers!

Sends an image people don’t understand. 
Really the world lacks visionaries. 
People call us cooks. 
Look at my posts from like 2012 ish
Been telling mofos to mine, then buy from exchanges when they popped up. 
Nobody listened. 
Still stacking my friend. 
You keep doing the same. 
Let em all keep doing theirs. 
Once we have enough capital we will be the developers of new systems, and ways of doing everything. From healthcare to enterprise and entertainment, government. There’s nothing that blockchain won’t bless.

Okay guys, 
He's been paid off by Banking cartels to do EXACTLY this. 
This whole saga is to strike fear into our hearts for trusting this revolutionary system which is gaining adoption very quickly. 
It's one of many (soon to come) last ditch fighting efforts being orchestrated by oligarchical banking cartels to debase and destabilize digital currency mediums so they can continue to suck the blood of us peons.
