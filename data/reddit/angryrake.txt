And tells Microsoft that you're doing it too. :)

No but it's a way to revoke an idiot's privilege to an opinion.

But they don't - they barely understand how their own currency works.

Someone should tell these folks that the British pound has been found in the pockets of every criminal in the country.  Coincidence perhaps? I think not.  This is a clear indication that criminals (even pedophiles) are using the British pound.

It took me while too but I didn't learn it because of bitcoin but rather just because I didn't know how it worked.  For a large part of my life I lived in ignorance too (I'm not referring to you here) - not caring how things worked but just how it affects me and what I could do about it.  I feel a lot of people are the same with things in general (not just currency) - they only care if it makes a direct impact on their life. Sometimes,  though,  things can make a serious impact on your life and the problem is complicated enough that people just neglect it - like the devaluation of a currency base - because of deregulation - yet people still don't take an interest - even though their lives and assets are being robbed. They will even go as far as to call you paranoid or flat out to refuse to accept the reality.. Maybe even heavily criticise the solution and associate it with crime and paedophilia (like OP's post) - this is ignorance and it's something I try really hard with people to help them understand but I just get the glazed look; I don't want to step on anyone's toes and be hated for it; I want to preserve my sanity and I'd rather not be known as some kind of social outcast quack.
Life sure is a difficult game and people make it nearly impossible to do the right thing..  To learn and grow.. Because everyone has their stupid little answers (to problems) created out of thin air with their less than expert opinion. All too happy to offer up their opinions that do more harm than good.  That's a huge problem with westerners - they think they have some entitlement to always be giving out an expert's opinion on literally everything.. Most people offer up advice and opinions when they have less than twenty minutes experience in something. I wish people would just realise that we are all ignorant but some of use have real answers to real problems.. Answers that weren't made up on the spot.. But drowned out by mediocrity. 
Rant over lol.  I type too fast and a paragraph quickly becomes a chapter.

Mainstream.  This is what happens when the general riff raff congregate.

Well in that case you would need a compiler or interpreter installed on the computer. The executable would also be flagged eventually.  It's so easy to hide virus code from virus scanners (packing/obfuscation) that it makes no sense to adopt the system you are suggesting.. But I like your thinking. Think about the firmware on your hard drive instead.. It's closed source and there's nothing to say that there isn't code in there that does something malicious to the OS if,  say, a file with a particular name is created.
@_date: 2014-05-14 00:39:03
I second that.  The irony is that only people like yourself will understand the comeuppance - they are oblivious idiots.

It can function without centralisation - we just need the software to do it.

"WiFi jammer" - aka *microwave*.  Use a few hundred watt jammer at 2.4Ghz and watch everyone's brain cook. It's definitely an effective censorship tool.

Bitcoin noob here - what are some good alternatives?
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:35:20
Close? What do you mean close? The network is tapped and every device on the planet has proprietary code - including Linux (firmware|microcode) 
@_date: 2014-05-14 00:44:51
That would be awesome but I cannot see it being adopted yet. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:58:57
I just hope people stand up for once and  do something fucking useful.. Instead of falling for the same old tricks.

They're spying on YOU and for that they don't need proof. Let's hope he gets what they want and bans Snapchat and WhatsApp - people might then actually start to care.
@_date: 2015-01-03 08:37:58
Yeah..  "My condolences".
@_date: 2016-01-06 15:00:12
You're joking right? This is a joke?

Not at the peak of a bubble that's for sure. I mean - nobody knows where  the peak is but when it has risen 1000% in the space of a month or two you have to expect it's going to drop. 
How many did you buy?
@_date: 2015-07-13 00:03:57
You bought at 1200??
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:41:56
Well now would be a better time to buy - but the  again that's going on an assumption.
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:20:21
Probably.  It's a lot more stable than that time around the bubble. I feel it's still at the tail end of an overall decline and a slight upturn is easy to be optimistic about.

For a start, of the NSA or GCHQ want to known everything about you they don't have to work very hard. Secondly, it's the company that will be selling your data.
