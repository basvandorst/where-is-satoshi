But I don't think I installed it. Is there a chance that it may have installed itself as a virus?
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:53:35
Right? Ok thanks. That's how I felt about it but I needed more educated input
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:50:44
So where should I move my money? Or will it cost too much?

Is coinbin secure &amp; reputable?

Are any of those free? Lol I know I am a minority in the bitcoin community- but I'm low income and I basically just put money that I can truly spare into bitcoin, my wallet only has 0.0017 bitcoin right now cause I had to buy some parts for my Jeep and unfortunately had to use some of my "savings"

Maybe you shouldn't be so lax with your info. And if you're going to be making friends with strangers- your better be smart enough to be able to tell if that person is just being your friend because of your finances. People who do this kind of stuff are pretty easy to spot. They typically have a physical dependence on alcohol and/or drugs, they typically are fun and outgoing and more introverted people tend to be attracted to that, they are overly nice but never seem to pick up the tab, usually ask if they can crash with you for awhile.... Come on. Don't be a dumbass. No offense but really, I am an attractive female, I'm very bubbly, friendly, and people tend to take to me rather quickly. Often I see people put themselves in situations where I could easily take advantage of them- and every time I explain to them that they can't be telling people they just met so much about their finances or inviting them to live with them ect. and that if I wasn't me they would be setting themselves up to get fucked over.
TLDR:  If you are going to be Fucking with Bitcoin, DONT BE STUPID.

I would prefer to do it myself

Yeah I know I'm not planning on putting a large amount in there anything just fair enough so that I can just let it grow for a while and then go shopping with it when I feel it's grown sufficiently. What do you mean until I alone hold the private keys
