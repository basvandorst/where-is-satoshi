Here it is, this is the direct source. No article or bullshit. She made the comments in 2015 and you can research who she is and tell me what’s going on here. Co-Founder of Lightning Labs is I think her current title. So one of the very companies you mentioned, she is the one I’m referring to.

How can it be slander if it’s true? BTC has high fees, that’s fact. BCH is .001 USD...you can’t disagree with facts

Didn’t they say that lightning Network was six months away...two years ago?
Edit source: 
Co-founder of Lightning Labs said this in 2015

Well she was CEO and Co-Founder of Lightning Labs. And I have no idea. But lightning network was promised two years ago and still isn’t here...where is it? I just don’t understand what happened to that development from two years ago.

Yeah I’m going to have to find it. You’re right I am mistaken. I thought when I wrote that it didn’t make sense that LN had a CEO. I’ll find it soon. Like I said though, I do believe in both coins, the here and now, BCH, but if Segwit and LN get implemented for sure BTC will remain the number one coin. I just don’t want it to take another year or more. The crypto market is growing fast, and BCH is already claiming the Bitcoin name and now some companies are starting to refer to BTC as Bitcoin Legacy.

Right right my bad. It is coming. But when do the fees go away? Like is it this year? What needs to be done to roll it out? Like who need to do what in order for it to roll out. What can be done to facilitate it? Is it just mere adoption at this point?

I will it was the CEO of LN. I’ve been busy today but I’ll find it 
Edit: it is the co-founder of Lightning Labs

I support both, I just support facts. So the BTC devs don’t develop the LN, so why were the devs behind BTC brought up in relation to developing and rolling it out?

Who is promoting bcash? No one supports bcash. We all support BCH

It dips every single night. It’ll hit its low around 2-4am. Be ready, but it is pretty consistent about dipping at night after midnight EST

I’m pretty sure credit card fees in US are near 3% and merchants have to pay for them by the TOS agreement from the credit card vendors. In fact, vendors will pull the credit card machines from stores that force their customers to pay the fees.

Pineapple Fund is switching to BCH, so probably very little
