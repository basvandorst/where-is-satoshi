Asking people to shill and paying people to do so are two different things.    I’m not following it closely because I don’t like the project but is there proof besides buying subreddits and websites that he pays people?   
I don’t like the guy as much as the next but info before pitchforks.

I can't see a feed and I had about 350 people I followed.  Now all I see are my own posts, retweets and liked posts.  This has been for 6 days.

“Allegedly” hires shills.     
I am fairly certain this is not an accurate use of the word.   The dude is a scammer and whether or not his shills are paid, they’re still mindless shills.

You are not alone.   Been like this for a week for me.   I can't add new people to follow and my follower count is 0.

In celebration of our new website, we're giving away 5-50 BTC!!!   Just send 0.5 BTC to the addr.......  
While I like the idea, I didn't participate.   You should market by pointing out scammers on twitter and linking your website.

I didn't like him.  Now I hate him.

BCash is TRash.  
Don’t waste your time here folks.   Dude won’t have a real conversation.   Called out when wrong on volume and then changes the subject pretending that the original point didn’t apply.   
Just another BCash shill who accidentally joined the wrong sub because Roger told him it was Bitcoin.

I don’t see this as shaming, just a casual mention of how close these two nefarious people are.

You will still be able to see peoples posts but they can't see yours.   If they try to add you, it won't let them.

It was sort of a joke.

Maybe shes the one who bought 1 billion in BTC the past 2 weeks.

Komodo is a good example of this.  They run their blockchain on top of Bitcoin, and attach their dPOW (dedicated notaries) to the bitcoin blockchain.   
As more and more of these projects come in to play, the bitcoin chain will live on through them.

This is a cool fact most people forget.   
 
I want to say without sounding like a shill that Komodo can, sort of.   Their protocol is secured to the bitcoin blockchain.  Their network of notary nodes has been setup to do this.
