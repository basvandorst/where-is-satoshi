Whats to stop any exchange from doing this? Create fake accounts to sell fake coins to other fake accounts with fake fiat -&gt; price drops. Delete the accounts and buy back with "real" account. Then use fake accounts to bring the price back up. Shit, you could just manipulate it 1 or 2% so no one notices. Rinse and repeat.

So now it is easier for current users to spend btc (which is sold for cash) but still difficult for new users to buy btc. Won't this drive down the price in the short term?

falling knife, arbitrage, dead cat bounce, etc. Except tomorrow it will be to the moon. I can't wait to buy all the cheap coins. 
tl;dr markets are irrational. Don't listen to this drunken fool.

But you already get 1% with most credit cards and you don't have to go through an exchange.

google 2FA
I made backups but then deleted them when I saw a post a few months ago about a person who had their btc stolen from a backup. (2FA does not protect backups.)

I thought there was a minimum you can send and not have to pay fees? Since you would be sending to and from yourself, it really does not matter as long as you have the capital.

Well, you could always "stack the deck." Have 50% of the volume be fake accounts. Or make fake buy/sell walls and control when they come down. Lots of ways to cheat the system when you can create infinite accounts with infinite capital. You only have to make sure that you keep the trades between the fake accounts and don't accidentally fulfill a real order with fake money. (very easy)
