Take my upvote already

I cant understand why people dont get this
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:47:38
You mean his cabinet members
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:34:10
Bingo, some people, like me, have a job to earn a pension and insurance. The sooner I can quit the better. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:08:24
No, it's because of the work china and especially s korea has done. All Trump does is give an excuse to act out and use propaganda to galvanize the population. He needs to shut his damn mouth and quit poking the bear
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:42:26
What? No shit. The only thing preventing international catastrophe is the us govt and the professionals that run it. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:57:15
Central banks have clear advantages. You and Jackson might not like it but we all have hugely advantaged from it. His insistence on fighting it caused a lot of unnecessary problems. Not to mention an all around less secure storage of wealth. There's nothing guaranteed in life but the closest world be a US Treasury.  bill

But what about tower 7? Yeesh...
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:52:10
They were not becoming citizens. Daca receipts were basically treated like resident legal aliens. They had to be in school, graduate high school or have a job and be unconvicted of crimes. They also had to come after a certain date (the oldest are in their 30's
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:38:46
Youre confused on what a fascist is
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:44:55
Yup, your point? It still was an unnecessary financial catastrophe. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:56:30
Yeah, i dont get it either
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:26:04
Old and full of shit?

@_date: 2018-01-04 16:44:25
So much so it caused a long and deep recession
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:51:04
Thats complete bullshit and you know it. He is acting like a child. Its embarrassing and you should be ashamed at his complete incompetence in foreign affairs. His reckless nature is going to start something that could have been avoided, if he would just act like a fucking adult.
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:00:09
Yuck. D'Souza speeches are about as useful as tits on a horse. We'd all be a lot better if he was just still in jail
@_date: 2019-07-15 10:57:39
I want to live in a world where belief in sky daddy doesnt come into conflict with serving the public.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:28:32
What? Putin is the literal definition of deep state. Hes ex kgb!
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:10:25
Its certainly not helping s. korea, the ones who would lose the most. In fact, hes showing the world that the us govt cant be trusted to act in a rational manner anymore. Thats not good for anyone, especially americans
@_date: 2019-07-15 12:26:10
Don't worry, that biblically based decision-making will be overturned with a quickness. 
Funny that you think I'm in authoritarian when you wish to have laws based on fairy tales. I'm not sure if you don't understand or are hostile to civil rights. Good luck with that
@_date: 2019-07-15 12:41:48
You might or might not be but you are sympathetic to their justified discrimination and that's just as bad. How about American who understands the Constitution and the role of civil rights in our modern government? That sounds good to me
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:00:07
Provoking nuclear war on twitter would be one.
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:56:51
I don't think you know what a fascist is. We have anti-discrimination laws, deal with it. You're not an 18th century gentleman farmer
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:44:16
Slavery is forced labor. Nobody is forcing anybody to bake cakes for the public. If you want to do that, you have to follow certain rules to not discriminate. Same goes for lunch counters in the deep South
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:29:34
Dude has a business open to the public. There is no excuse to discriminate. Go do something else if you think sky daddy will be mad at you
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:33:17
Get a red white red card from investment. Austria is stunning. 
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:30:39
Lets hope
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:07:03
Authoritarian bigots huh? You do you, and ill do me. Why force me to live under a rules that are based on beliefs and not good policy/societal good? I wouldnt advocate for church burnings and a completely secular existence

Too bad she never got one

Yeah, I'm a bit bummed but I only invested $2,000 so I'm either right in this shit to the moon or deep, deep into the Earth

Living in a non turd world country is expensive. Student loans dont help either

Not surprising, Dimon is a fucking douchebag extraordinaire

True, you could argue theyre the best at it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:30:30
Tell my tax assessment and mortgage company that. I earn a decent living but after mortgage, income taxes, food, bills and retirement savings, it'd take me 10 years to save 100k. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:18:39
Ugh.... don't remind me
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:46:19
I don't remember the exact wording but it was some sort of financial emergency situation. I tried to borrow against it to pay off some high interest debt and they told me no
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:09:26
I guess I was spoiled because I'm a bit annoyed now because of this. Thoughts on it ever climbing?

46.1of voters actually (not the 48.2 that voted against)
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:45:50
The ability to short will add to legitimacy and help prevent a negative backlash from the us govt. Thats what ive taken away from it

And you wont go broke from major medical problems....its not all roses and bubble gum in america

Those rubbles must be running low, huh?

What dont you get about discrimination and civil rights?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:06:01
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:42:55
I was referring more to a gold not debt based international economy. Whatever works
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:39:31
No, rampant and consistent lying and misinformation. Dont be coy  
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:13:21
Just another reason to never watch anything fox. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:56:35
Must be nice. Mine wont let me take a loan out unless im going broke or have an emergency
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:56:36
yup, the value you get for your tax dollars is much better than mine, imho
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:18:09
I mean, youre really holding her to that in these times? Weird standards you have

This is the most American story ever. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:20:11
America has a rich people = bad mentality? News to me
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:51:11
It isn't a fascist dictatorship yet. There's always time. That doesn't make him not a fascist or at least a sympathizer. 
Also, slow your roll. It's a fucking username.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:22:46
Damn....that just hurts. Id be an upset asshole for like a year straight. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:38:25
Thanks for letting me know how you feel about my username. You're definitely the first one to say something. 
How about a passport and a history degree? 
Nice deflection
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:35:57
Ugh, wait for it to skyrocket because of this jackass. Hodl
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:40:27

Weird definition of smart

Same, kicking myself in the ass for the past month
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:17:24
If you're talking about the Soviets, there was no food because the ruling regime was inept and corrupt. But either way I'm not advocating for communism. Communism is as dumb as libertarianism
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:43:52
Who's a communist? Certainly not Sanders
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:39:15
Smdh. Youre a lost cause. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:17:22
Why do I even try?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:14:11
I prefer to see it as equal access. Some mother fuckers are lazy but they're still people. Everyone has to eat
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:58:40
Fascist apologist
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:37:39
And everything else started to rise. The world economy is doing pretty well right now
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:42:04
Human psychology begs to differ.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:19:07
I dont think people are inherently lazy. Sure, a small minority ate garbage but most people will do what interests themselves if given the free and equal access to do so. There are a lot of us that would do different things if it weren't for money thats owed. People also fuck up. Its mans imperfect nature. Being a wage slave sucks balls
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:33:34
Awful presumptuous, dont you think? Once again, no one is advocating for Communism. Its as much of a pipe dream, if not more, than libertarian/anarcho-capitalist ideas. Blending highly regulated capitalism with a social welfare state creates the ability to be creative and take risks, not just work until you're dead in a dead end job because you didnt go to the right school, were born in the wrong neighborhood or had shitty/poor parents. Some will always succeed and some will continually fail but I dont see a problem with allowing someone to be able to eat and have a roof over their head when a small minority have enough money for many generations to live off of. How is that good for society?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:38:44
Bahahaha.... You made me spit out my drink with that stupid remark
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:13:11
Yuck. You're not doing it right
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:51:44
So no major war has been fought over capitalist aggression? Give me a break
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:54:19
Dude has some messed up politics, im guessing?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:46:34
What are you getting at? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:45:16
Democratic socialist.... That's an ocean away from communist
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:35:54
You are right. I just don't care to anymore
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:12:35
LOL do you think that's actually going to matter? I stopped giving a shit about giving people research two years ago. It's pretty much pointless
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:58:54
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:36:29
Youre working for a lost cause then. Good luck
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:35:16
Hmmmm... Anarcho-capitalist?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:37:26
Probably between the coziness with his administration and business and being a cult like leader would be a start 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:38:22
Participation trophy is a lot different than being able to eat
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:17:57
Pure socialism maybe. Democratic socialism is not even close.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:37:27
You better move along, Mommy's got your tendies ready
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:21:26
And yes we can afford it, easily. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:55:56
Um, what? I don't think you're getting the just of what he's saying. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:14:44
Thats some real Locke-ian idealism there. The state of man hasn't existed in a very long time. I dont see the trend reversing as long as a government can lock you in a cage. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:29:31
With an autocratic ruler? Probably. Democratic socialism is much more like 16 people holding their dicks in a room. It's hard to do anything, on purpose
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:56:43
Literally an everyday statement in my head. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:36:58
Bitcoin brings everybody together. Isn't it great?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:20:33
No one likes an asshole
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:43:22
It could but I dont think too much. Its the king
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:38:34
What policies? I dont think he has policies, just a cult of personality
