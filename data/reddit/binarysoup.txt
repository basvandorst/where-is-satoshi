Its also important to note that there is a difference between mining and running a node. On the other extreme I think its stupid that people try to run Nodes on weak ARM chips. That's not helping the network. Is it so hard to have an old PC or laptop run BTC?

The main problem if you accept the hash before you check the transactions, you can confirm a invalid block. Thus creating a fork, and people(nodes/miners) will only realize potentially after another block has been found. Which would mean two blocks would have to be cut provided it doesn't continue to happen becoming the main chain despite invalid transactions.  Best case you stop mining on the bogus chain and lose money because you still should have been searching for a solution to the last block.
I do not think this is a good idea because the potential fork problem is too high.

Pretty much every company is working hard on this problem, coinbase, circle, blockchain.info, bit go. Everybody is making it easier, however fundamentally bitcoin is very different, and there will still be a learning curve if people are actually going to hold their own money instead of the way they have done it their entire lives.  This is also a bigger problem more than just bitcoin, that people are completely tech illiterate. I can't believe how many people don't know that computers can break and get viruses, and it is their fault 90% of the time, same goes with everything else but even when their money is on the line people are stuck thinking it is someone else's problem.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean or you understand what is happening in a bitcoin wallet, somewhere there is confusion so I will give it a shot.
Basically what you are describing is a wallet. Nothing else is going on, and there is a balance associated to each key since you will get the public key and search through the transaction history too see available funds. The public key is generated by the private key so you don't need to store it. But there is no reason not to, since you will just have to re-generate it.

I think the ability to export a shit load of pulbic keys to a file in a standardized format so it could be used by other programs. I'm not sure if there would be a better way without INTERNET connectivity. Lets say you have a POS system you could export like 10k public keys to it, and the cashier would never have the ability to spend the coins but could verify that the money has been received and the owner has the hardware wallet.

first bit coins I got were from feather coin mining early in 2013, got like 4 btc from that back in the day.  Then when I thought it was happening in october I bought some on local bitcoins from 700-900$ this all amounted to less than 10. Then I went full retard and converted almost all my liquid assets into bitcoin through coinbase between 400-600$

oh man it was a long time ago let me see here
let n = a few million like 2 atm (only addresses that have a balance)
n!*(2^160 choose n) / (2^160n ) = probability of finding a address with a balance
that number is super small
like even if there were 100 billion addresses full of coin you would still have to search a long time (millions of years) at an unreasonable amount of searches per second

Kinda, you have to also port forward port 8333 from you're router to you're computer and open your fire wall(probably already done). You will know when you have more than 8 connections, otherwise you are still leaching, leaving it on all the time without the open port is actually bad for the network since you're taking a connection from someone else(not always 1:1 though).

Basically the miners are just generating a specific number, that is hard to do, and when someone finds the number, everyone else says congratulations have some bitcoin and then they also confirm transactions. Its essentially a lottery and compute power and electricity is the entry fee.  So anyone who can confirm transactions is financially invested in bitcoin and therefore should tell the truth. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:19:10
This is one of the few remaining actual problems with bitcoin, and it started only recently, once the blockchain became large and unwieldy.   There also isn't enough incentive to mine with p2ppool  and/or people just don't give a shit, and/or its too technical.  
After all Ghash.IO was near 50% for a long time but people just didn't give a shit. Personally I think when people had to figure out how to mine CPU/GPU it was only technically folks now with premade solutions setting up P2p pool is more difficult than mining in the first place which is often not the case with GPU's.  So how can we fix this?
To me the one thing that really needs to happen is that the block chain needs to be pruned, this is the most important thing that needs to happen before the network can scale, because its not that important if you have to download 1mbyte a minutes(10x current) if you're only going to store 50% or less of it.  This is certainly manageable,  I remember somebody did the calculations of what the size would be if we had gradually scaled to 2000 transactions a second.  While in the future it might be manageable to store, but redownloaing the blockchain becomes an issue, even for mobile lite wallets that just get the header information, and the info for their keys, it becomes really bandwidth intensive to download the 70-80% of used transactions that no longer have any value in them.
This also extends to those FUCKERS AT MASTERCOIN and all those other "bitcoin 2.0" solutions that rape the bitcoin network for its resources and contribute nothing. There is no reason you can either A: Create your own coin with its own proof of work or just plain proof of stake like Etherium/NXT, oh that too much work for you.... right.  B: Merge mine with another network BTC/LTC are both very secure, if your coin is actually useful people will CHOOSE to use it.  Rather than the current case where your shit ideas are forced on to the network and no way to stop you other than the tradition transaction fees. 
(/rant) TLDR: stop abusing the network, the devs already did what they could to limit you without removing other important features. 
As a possibility to pay nodes for their service, i think it could be possible to pay two fees, one to the first node you relay to by creating an open ended transaction that they can fill in with their own information as long as you limit the amount.  The problem is this absurdly increases transaction count, so this is basically useless.  The other way to do this is to have a proof of stake system, although i'm not sure to do this without inflation, maybe split the tx fees into a pool that goes to the miner and a pool that goes to a random node, the selection processes for which nodes to reward is not straight forward, and maybe the solution might be more clear after stuff like maidsafe come out to see how they pay you for holding storage space/bandwidth.
other stuff
You also need to make sure only nodes get paid if they have a good history of strong upload speeds/transaction propagation and actually have the full chain.  This is really two problems though since to limit the number of nodes you might need something where each node has to pay to be verified.  But this detracts from number of nodes, but you need to also then reward them once they have a good history.  
And all of this would increase the actual cost of the network since currently mining pools are the only ones paying the bandwidth/server costs and not the miners which ideally should have already been built into the price of minning but is not gradually not, as the mining gets more centralized.

The way Mycelilm works is that every time you create a new private/public key pair you need to back up. Newer wallets don't need you to do this. As you back up a seed that is used to generate all the keys, and the seed is enough to regenerate the keys if lost.
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:52:22
lol Utorrent is absolute shite. Why would you pay/buy something that has adds and is also sub tier compared to its competition. Answer you are stupid.
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:20:49
no need to be sorry, you are in the right place
1. Some places might do this but there is absolutely no reason to, its only nessisary when the purchase is large since the effort to pull a "simple" double spend is a lot of work and being well timed etc. If you're going go buy a tv then 1 conf is enough, for a car you might want 6 but, you don't expect to buy a car in under an hour do you? For a coffee a double spend wouldn't be worth it. Same reason starbucks dosen't have everyone sign for their coffee on a credit card, its just too small.
2. No, you have the private key you never let anyone else (or machine have it) otherwise those coins aren’t truly yours. You show the machine one of you public keys and it will send you the money.
3. Sure, I'm not too familiar with it though, its a great entry wallet though
4. no idea maybe someone else knows the real reason, but if I had to guess its with their buy coins feature to add the person you are buying from so its easy to call them.
5. I believe it should, most wallets have some type of notification.
6. Data, it won't use a huge amount of data, but that is relative. I believe Mycelium connects to servers for blockchain data so there is very little data, for other apps that connect right to the blockchain, there is usually a setting to only sync when connected to wifi, while you can use you data to send transactions which is tiny, or catch up a few hours.                     Tl:dr you need net connection to send and receive, it wont use much data.

Yes, the public key is derived from the private key. Well you can, you just have to try all 2^160 possible combinations, and to do such would require more time and power than exists in the known universe, so were pretty safe.  But as to why and how this is possible, its called a one-way function. Its a really complex and interesting topic. heres a link.

1. Its easier. If you are new you might not believe what I just said so thats why I have the others down below, you have to really use it to see.
2. They believe in holding bitcoin as a store of value, it(when) it appreciates it is easy to spend rather than selling into usd.
3. The group/person accepting the payment is providing an incentive to used bitcoin as it benefits them over other payment methods.
4. The group/person is offering an incentive because selling goods for bitcoin is easier than buying it outright.

well a lot of them are simple things, I think right before you submit a BIP it asks you to make sure it is a simple and easily thing to implement and benefits a large portion of the community.
A good example the bitcoin:address?amount standard for QR codes, nothing even needs to change in the protocol to have this and it makes every thing easy, if you have ever bought something and it tells you the exact amount in bitcoin right along with the address you've benefitted. 
You are also right BIPs that are difficult controversial and require a hard fork, are completely wrong that is not a bip, that needs serious testing first, or for them to write the code themselves.  People are lazy and want the tiny and poorly funded dev team to do it for them though.

Well you are going to be limited by space, I have not tried using a usb hard drive, but you're going to need at least 64g drive and that might only last till the end of the year. As far as processing power goes, the pi is fairly outdated now, there are a few better ones but arm vs x86 is a huge difference, I don't think the pi could keep up validating transactions and it would quickly run out of ram.
TL;DR not a good idea even if it works it won't last long with the growth of the network.
One of those AMD kabini(15w) chips would be a good fit, or an atom if you are really into intel...
The amd chips themselves are like 30$ and you can get a board for 40$ mem is going to kill you though and a hard drive for space, it would be &lt;200$ but that's comparable to a 80$ super pi( can't remember the name of the actual one) + storage space and it could double as a home sever.

Also would love a "coin control" feature that is currently implemented in bitcoin armoury, so that you can determine which addresses are used in a payment.

That is a very ignorant thing to say, after a certain point all companies will be very close in performance and will be forced to compete fairly due to such a small profit margin. This will probably be evident by the end of the year...

@_date: 2014-10-14 13:38:38
That they are useful, in that they provide a better mechanism of payment and that they are also limited in number.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:39:14
This would be so nice.
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:43:34
Yes, its only sort of anonymous, since you can create an account(address) without anyone knowing it was you, there is no direct way to know who's money it is. However, lets say you buy a coffee, then the store you bought from now knows you bought that coffee and those left over bitcoins are probably yours. Of course there are plenty of ways to hide it, but if you are not being careful, everyone can know how much you have.

After a while we will reach a point where the only growth of the bitcoin community combine with moores law which is basicaly over.  This should happen in another 6 months as they fully optimize for sha. Theres not much from here if I can guess what they've done with the silicon althpugh easily another 30%
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:58:22
I use a very small wallet, called wallet32.  It gives you a lot of control, I would not recommend this to start out, or if you just use bitcoin casually.
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:28:04
Yes if a transaction is never relayed to a miner node then it will not pass.
@_date: 2014-11-12 03:25:07
I think it might be ready, But I would expect nothing to occur for another 6 months at least unless there is something to trigger it.

Will it do anything, no will it change anything no. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:57:34
Well it really depends on what you want out of it.  If you want to hold bitcoins, then the wallet will be sufficient.  However if you want us dollars, when they pay you, you will need to use a payment processor like coinbase.
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:05:07
you mean my opinion? Dogecoin has a higher than desired amount of orphan blocks. Litecoin has very few, so the sweet spot is somewhere between 1 and 2:30. But 1 minute blocks could cause problems, like dogecoin being basically run by the developers to keep the fork on the correct path...
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:53:18
So now if you buy anything with btc you have to wait hours fucking great
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:13:59
This is how the internet works and has worked for the last 20 years, bitcoin has nothing to do with it. Many applications work this way. Its usually abstracted from the user because most users aren't running their own servers.
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:46:30
I haven't used mycelium in a while.  From what I remember you only store one key at a time.  This is really bad for privacy, and and old system. Wallet32 uses bitcoinJ which follows BIP that standardized storing multiple keys under one "phrase", this is compatible with electrum and other wallets.  I can import everything with just one phrase with 10 words.  Its also decentralized no central servers like Mycelium, it just connects directly to the bitcoin network.  There is also the ability to have separate groups of addresses, to keep your money more private, in addition to avoiding address reuse.  
Reasons not to use it are that the program has a rough interface, its not regularly updated, I'm sure there are other wallets that are better than this actually.  It works for me, so no worries now and I can always import it into electrum if it ever goes wrong.
@_date: 2015-05-11 07:00:11
That's probably the actual compute power of those cards. But that's is a worthless statistic really...
@_date: 2015-05-08 03:28:30
yes.  You are no more likely to get into 20mb block if you are spaming than a 1mb block.  The rules against spamming have not changed.  The 1mb was the first rule a hotfix to prevent block bloat, but now we have fees and free transactions have age and size requirements. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:51:53

its still centralized though right?
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:25:47
Well as you know its never 100% safe so it only really matters how much money you're going to put on it &lt;1 btc I would say sure fine. Although personally I wouldn’t because you need a phone to get it back. If its more than 10 btc then multiple paper wallets is the way to go. In the middle there is where I say a computer back up is good.
@_date: 2015-01-12 06:41:10
This is bad, you should not do this........
@_date: 2015-01-07 06:39:29
fiat money gets stolen all the time, the number of credit card theft is absurd. It goes unnoticed because people have just accepted it now as normal, and the customer rarely takes the blame.  There is also large scale theft all the time... Also a majority of banking infrastructure is very old, so the huge bugs have been patched a long time ago.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:23:10
If you don't have the techinial know how to run p2p maybe you shouldn't be mining.  You are the reason the network is vulnuerable. You have only yourself to blame on that front. 
In repect to variance the difficulty changes every 2 weeks or 10-14 days depending on block time.  Any pool that gets a hand full of blocks in this time will not change you're payout signifigantly. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:11:50
I was happy with BTC-e and have been saying that they are the most stable for a long time, but people would downvote and say to use bitstamp. Look whos laughing now.

it will be high speed once completed. This is defiantly 20 years out but it does seem like it will be faster than you might imagine, easily gigabit per user. This is very different from the current satellite internet stuff because those are 33k km and these will be just 1k km lot less lagg...

Yea that will happen, because you know google really likes bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:41:26
Someone should test these with an updated version of Bitcoin Core and see whats the maximum number of transactions they can process, and for how many nodes.  Otherwise they are useless and not what we want to have running the bitcoin network.

There is plenty of regulation, I think anymore regulation just means putting in back door currency controls.
@_date: 2015-04-09 04:59:41
I think that is pretty silly, you obviously know there will be fees to cover the mining,I think it would be reasonable to have miners stop at night when there are few transactions or perhaps over holidays when ppl are staying in. On and off every 10 minutes makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-04-09 04:20:04

I think the 1/2 bill into startups is a waste,  you would stand to profit a lot more just buying bitcoin. There is such a high failure rate and I don't think there have been any startups for bitcoin that have actually done something useful and innovative.
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:29:08
If you go by what has happened so far there are huge swings depending on several things
@_date: 2015-04-06 04:32:51
Current blockchain ~ 32gb. Largest possible SD ~ 200gb.  That is roughly 3 years if every block is one MB.  And hopefully people will get some common sense and raise the blocksize limit.  If that happens it will run out in a year.  I also don't believe that the processor will be able to keep up.  If you want to contribute to the network the right thing to do is run an old computer.  Something that can handle at least 100mb blocks. Any most desktops in the last 10 years or a laptop in the last 5 will do. Ex pentium 4  or Athlon 64 with 2gb ram.
@_date: 2015-04-06 04:33:54
Yea sync time alone would take forever.
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:03:07
Just buy bitcoins.  A billion dollars is enough to cause a huge run up in price.  You would no doupt have more money in the end if you bought slowly.  I think the most important thing would be to cause an increase in price.  A lot of people have heard of bitcoin but dissmiss it.  If the price doubles again and stays there, I think people can't ignore it. That being said, a huge contribution to development would also help.  And you could easily spend a 100k to double the number of valid nodes on the network, I think this would happen if bitcoin could implement pruning and the price goes up.
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:50:54
A pi shouldn't run a full node, it will easily get behind in the future.

You couldn't get away with a 64 because the few gb of os and it will probably be to little by the end of the year.  Any smaller hard drive and you don't save any money, they're all 50$.  Also with a tb you can easily run 3 nodes for diff coins.

Yes obviously it needs to happen blocks are already hitting 800kb and ifnthere is a long time without blocks then it will take more than one block to recover
