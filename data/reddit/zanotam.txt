Platinum is pretty damn rare and is also quite popular as a catalyst, so gold still maintains a usage in electronics. Silver also stands in as the weakest for electronics usage, but like platinum it has important alternative usages.

What about those of us who have been around for a sufficiently long time that we still remember when people were just talking about Bitcoins and not "Bitcoins and blockchain technology?"
It's hard to hit a moving target. In theory at least. I mean, realistically, I just sti around and read about this stuff to see if it's ever likely to make the jump to real usability, but unfortunately no luck outside of the drug trade (which, ironically, most of vehemently claims is NOT a major coin spender. Because silk road never happened?). I mean, virtual currency is obviously a good idea, but pseudo-anonymity is a problem in and of itself (the blockchain shows more than it hides for the average spender now compared to other current options). And then you have the fact that it started out as just BitCoin, but now the marketing scheme is "BitCoin and the Block Chain(ettes)" with the people who actually matter, the tech nerds, slowly spiraling off into the world of the block chain while the rest of insists they're not losing anything with this shift.

So obviously a constructive proof is impossible. However, one can look at the fact that water is a VERY common chemical and then note that it has a metric buttfuck of properties that are best or at least best-in-class where the class includes various concepts of 'stability'. It's everywhere and it's useful for even something as simple as absorption of heat (iirc it's the second best 'simple' chemical in the universe when it comes to absorbing heat and it has a much wider range temperature range before phase change of anything that can absorb more heat) which is a universal requirement of anything involving energy and thus of life.

Why is the concept of the growth of wealth ridiculous at all? There's more wealth now than there was in 1990. More wealth in 1990 than 1970. More in 1970 than 1950.

I've never understood that attitude, but I buy into the idea that when shit hits the fan all those "crazy" survivalists will turn into ACTUAL crazies, gun wielding maniacs outside of the law.... leeches on society as things rebuild without them.

Well, presumably flies aren't what you want to attract so still go with honey.

There's no such thing as an alien that doesn't use water. Water is probably the most universally useful chemical in existence with huge amounts of unique or extreme properties (e.g. it's in the top 5 of a lot of lists of properties which are necessary for chemistry). Of course, we could be even more theoretical and assume that these aliens are not composed of chemicals in the normal sense and that can be useful from a philosophical perspective, but from a realist perspective a line must be drawn and water is undeniably on the "intrinsically valuable" side of the line due to it's metric fuckton of unique or rare and highly useful properties, all in a single substance.

Mining is what makes bitcoin decentralized yet secure.

And the blatant racism leaks through the dog whistles.

Ya'll would be on the other side of this argument just a couple of years ago. But now that you gotta worry that the people who may reach 51% of the total mining power are foreigners...

Except materialism is already dying..... millenials prefer to spend on experiences and creating memories which is encouraged by an inflationary currency. A deflationary currency is a great way to make the ever increasing concentration of wealth an even greater problem while killing circuses if not bread, thus increasing the chance for a revolution by the have-nots (who presumably would do away with deflationary currency aka bitcoin and switch back to the model under which they'd been happier and more prosperous).
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:37:09
Because it encourages people to spend on experiences and memories which has been shown to be the best way to end up happy. The utility of more money very quickly becomes almost nothing compared to one's ability to accumulate it while the utility of more social experiences, memories with friends and family, and living in the moment has never been measured to vanish.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:25:51
Which is a lot. And you only mess with older more materialist thinkers - millenials want memories and experiences and within a finite lifespan the matter of quantity vs quality is more complicated for such purposes, but deflationary money may hurt that and in the end we'll end up with an acceleration of the already growing gap between the haves and the have-nots while reducing the happiness of the have-nots. Which is a great way to force a revolution by the have-nots who will presumably then go back to the old model of inflationary currencies because they will be the ones who value things like human happiness over wealth accumulation.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:33:47
Er..... that's because most people don't 100% believe that bitcoin is guaranteed to take off and even those near that number think that they're getting in on the ground floor to the extent that almost any investment is going to be hugely valuable beyond their wildest dreams pretty much.
