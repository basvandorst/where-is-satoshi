There is already a separate malfix proposal in place with all of the code written, I believe it's still being vetted.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:59:17
I think you are missing the point a little here. Tether and Bitcoin, and all other cryptocurrencies for that matter are connected. The hypothetical is 
Tether printed from nothing -&gt; Bitcoin bought for essentially free -&gt; Billions of dollars of fake money flow into the market inflating the price.
As long as people believe the fake money is legit nothing happens, once it is exposed that it isn't those billions of dollars that have helped push the price of bitcoin and other cryptos up will essentially become worthless, which would most definitely bring the price of everything down with it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:41:55
Rightly so to be skeptical, I am as well, but slightly optimistic there will be a malleability fix available that is not segwit. I believe it would come as part of a hard fork, but as far as I know the BCH community would bundle it into one of the scheduled updates in the next year.
Will this actually happen? I'm not sure, not close enough to that development circle. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:13:33
I just gave you evidence there was no "insane increase in fees". I recognize you don't want to have a conversation about it, that's find, I'm only willing to provide you with the facts of the matter and you are more than welcome to be angry and spout nonsense if it makes you feel better.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:27:31
I had literally this exact same encounter a couple days ago at work. I have talked up crypto for a while now and a coworker, noting the rising price asked me how to get in. Recommend coinbase, she buys LTC since "she can afford one", has now tripled her investment after buying the wrong coin, and posted on facebook about it....
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:39:59
It certainly can in the short term with small block size increases while pursuing other scaling solutions.
10 year macro scale won't matter if other coins take Bitcoin's place. First mover advantage is huge but history has shown it doesn't guarantee success.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:45:26
You can have both, the divide is completely artificial and manufactured by both side to create an Us vs Them mentality.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:42:32
There is absolutely no guarantee Bitcoin' s price will continue to rise. Saying that everyone should have 20% of their worth in an extremely volatile speculative asset is a misinformed opinion at best, and malicious and harmful at worst.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:38:05
Only once they are settled on the main chain.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:26:52
I would assume not many? They are clearly distinguished even in the bitcoin.com wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:02:26
Or, they are simply adding the currencies that will be profitable to their business?
It's not like Coinbase is a small company, they can work on multiple things at once. If they deemed segwit as not a priority it's likely because it didn't make economic sense to pursue it at the time.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:07:23
Thanks for engaging in a discussion! You are welcome to do your own research on the matter.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:41:08
And it will... until it isn't. Past trends don't predict future price, period.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:06:39
I don't know if you know this but in this case 1030% and exponential would both be true in your falsely constructed world lol.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:03:41
It's not my timeline. If the current scaling roadmap made sense to me I would support it. But Bitcoin needs a solution now, not because I want it to have one, but because without it there is basically no use for Bitcoin. 
Adoption isn't waiting for Bitcoin to scale, consumers don't wait, and the general public at large could care less about a scaling roadmap.
I'm not denigrating core, but they need to think in the short term as well as the long, there is a middle ground, a small block size increase was intended in the original protocol.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:46:43
You don't need segwit to use lightning, it's just been implemented that way currently.
It will be adapted for all other coins if it's successful most likely
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:28:04
Here's a random block from that time period. Notice that 1 cent fees were also accepted.
I think it speaks for itself but if you want me to keep pulling them I can.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:02:05
No, it's really not. You can't purchase small sums of bitcoin without losing a majority of it to transaction fees. If a normal person can't buy 50$ worth of bitcoin, it's not open to a vast majority of the planet.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:11:09
I feel like this isn't exactly a great example considering how shit Apple has been at innovating since Jobs left (died).
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:10:14
Fees as a percentage of a transaction don't make sense in bitcoin since they are a flat rate. You'd could be paying a 50% fee on 100$ transacion or a 0.0005% fee on a 100,000$ transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:06:10
They are the people developing Bitcoin. And what They need to fix is the fact that Bitcoin is no longer useable by a currency in pretty much any situation except transferring large sums of value.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:52:18
Right, which is why this would never happen. I don't see Bitcoin ever truly dying, there is the possibility it loses dominance though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:12:47
I'm sorry, but you clearly don't understand how fees work, they are not, and never were, directly tied to the price of bitcoin. They are just based on network demand, you are essentially bidding against everyone else to get included in a block. 
It just so happens right now a majority of people were willing to pay 30+$ to move their bitcoin, it could be 100$ it could be 1$, it isn't attached to the price.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:38:12
What.... So your ideal vision of bitcoin is one where.... we don't use bitcoin at all.
Instead we are beholden to corporate run third party payment systems that are passing out IOUs until they are confirmed and settled with massive fees on the real blockchain?
I really want to believe in Bitcoin, and for it to succeed. I just don't see how that future works at all.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:58:54
What? The main limiting factor on capacity right now is limited block size. I'd love to see you evidence that bigger blocks doesn't scale transaction volume because that's simply not true. There are other trade offs and downsides sure.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:01:08
You do know the age of a reddit account doesn't represent how long that person has been involved in crypto right?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:38:26
The fees never actually rose, bitcoin cash blocks clear all transactions almost every block, you can get in with 1sat/b fee and get confirmed next block. This would continue to be true for like 4x bitcoin transaction volume. Say what you want about this a solution in the long term, but it does work right now. It's also not like you can't implement layer 2 on top of 2, 4, or 8 meg blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:59:27
Wait... do you mean the ones i acknowledged and then provided evidence against lol. The "average fee" calculation is a metric that's consistently used against Bitcoin as well, on either side it doesn't represent what you can pay to get into the next block, period.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:21:08
You could make the same argument about Everyone says the same talking points on both sides.
Lightning is coming
Store of value
Scaleable in the future.
Both sides come across as "astroturfed" but I think generally that term gets thrown around when people hear things they disagree with.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:03:27
Just because it sustains value doesn't in any way mean it has achieved it's goals though.
Bitcoin could be worth 1,000,000$ tomorrow, and if it doesn't enable those who are beholden to traditional payment systems and banks some freedom to use their money the way they want, what's the point?
I respect your opinion but I disagree, I don't think most people have bought Bitcoin, or any other crypto for that matter, for anything other than a hope for their money to grow.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:19:59
Right but this assumes holding coins on an exchange which we all know isn't a great idea. Admittedly Coinbase probably isn't going to become insolvent or anything, and since they are US based you are likely protected, but it doesn't really solve the issue that the network itself isn't useable.
I realize Lightning Network could in theory alleviate most small purchase concerns, but I have concerns of my own that adoption will be Segwit slow which, good idea or not, will be far too slow to stay competitive in such a fast moving space.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:32:15
It does need that to have basically any use.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:46:44
No, I did not, you clearly are not reading my comments, which frankly isn't shocking but I'll continue responding anyways. 
I linked you a block on the bitcoin cash chain. If you actually clicked the link you would see that it allows you to see the transaction fees paid for each transaction in it. I specifically chose one from the period that you are saying fees "rose exponentially". 
Transactions paying 1c were clearing in the same blocks as those paying much more. There is a problem in wallet code and fee calculation, it's also prevalent in Bitcoin with people paying more than they need to in fees. The difference being that your transaction would confirm in 1 block on bitcoin cash with a 1c fee.
I feel like I've explained this to you in every comment so far, but for some reason you find it "hilarious". 
It's pretty easy to understand if you take your blinders off for a second and use some mental capacity to draw your own conclusions.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:43:09
Sure, it is. But you are looking in the wrong place if you want security and a guaranteed retirement.
It sounds like crypto just isn't for you, it's intention wasn't to be a speculative vehicle, it was to be a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:04:24
Would you really trade a tub of protein powder today for Bitcoin though. In order to get your friend their money within a few days you'd have to pay like a 20$ transaction fee. 
I don't see how that's useable at all for day to day purchases.... or as a currency at all for that matter.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:11:06
I feel this should be pushed up for visibility. Everyone needs to at least understand why there isn't currently much downward pressure or volatility from the introduction of futures.
I am curious what the CME opening will be like, and if most brokers will keep this same stance for the time being.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:38:43
[Once again, segwit is optional](
By definition this means that everyone has equal choice to use or not use it. If the choice to pursue other developments such as improving the platform and/or adding other coins has a stronger economic incentive than adding segwit, said exchange has every right to not do it.
If you do so strongly disagree you are certainly welcome to use a different exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:31:57
They are different [exchanges]( The CME is much bigger however in terms of futures so the effect it has on the bitcoin market could possibly be bigger on it's introduction.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:25:11
Code is written by humans. People seem to have a disconnect a lot that the programs they use were written by people just like them.
Sure, they may be peer reviewed and tested ( possibly ) but this doesn't make them any less of a human invention.
And as a software developer myself I see a strange trend of giving "the code" credit without really understanding the underlying work that goes into creating these things.
Not to say Bitcoin isn't revolutionary, it is. Time will tell if the first mover advantage is enough to keep the  spot, but it will forever be remembered as the start of something big. But let's not pretend this is different than say something like the industrial revolution, it's people innovating, just this time in a virtual space.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:18:23
Using a web browser is not a comparison to throwing your money into a volatile asset.
If you don't know how a browser works you might.... I can't think of a scenario where that would cause catastrophic issues.
Throwing money into a speculative asset that could lose 50% or 90% of it's value overnight without an understanding of what it is and what it's purpose is is a lot more dangerous.
Should people invest in crypto, sure. Should they learn about it at a basic level first, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:02:10
Why is an uninformed user buying and holding something they haven't evaluated the merits of ever a good thing?
Other than for the speculative price that is.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:49:07
I'm not even sure what you are trying to argue? I presented the evidence that fees on bitcoin cash have stayed the same, you..... ignored that. As I said, you are welcome to your opinion, and sure as hell can ignore fact. Have a merry Christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:35
I'll have to check that out. Thanks for the recommendation!
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:46:41
It's wonderful that you made great returns off of bitcoin. But this sort of attitude just isn't productive or actually helpful. 
Yes, there's a good chance that bitcoin goes to the "moon" and is worth say 100k in a year. It's also perfectly possible that it crashes. 
No one really knows, and your past experiences do not correlate to future returns. 
Telling someone they are wrong to take a 5x return that could drastically improve their quality of life is just disingenuous at best.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:49:12
Bitcoin scaling right now is like if the world decided that we could never have more than two lane roads because sometime in the future you would have teleportation.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:08:26
The public discourse around cryptocurrencies is by no means censorship resistant though. And that has proven to be just a big of a factor as to what happens in the ecosystem as anything.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:02:59
It has been for years. But there has been no sign they have any plans on implementing it as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:22:45
No one is going to stop you. However, you will always have to pay whatever fees are present on the settlement chain.
That's what the previous posted means by the example, in order to compare to traditional payment systems in fees currently you'd need to pay 3% or less in fees to open and close the channel. Right now this means you'd have to load quite a large sum of money onto lightning in order for it to make sense to use it.
Not to say that you can't just ignore that to support the network, nothing particularly wrong with that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:01:36
That is quite literally all this sub is about though.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:28:48

Comment chains like these, the reducing of a complex issue down to name calling, is why it is hard to take either of the bitcoin subreddits mentioned in the article seriously.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:11:57
I agree with large chunks of the article. However, it detracts from the substance of your message when you resort to petty personal attacks on a community, regardless of how "hell like" you think the content is.
Both subreddits are now full of flame wars and personal attacks which really add nothing to either community, regardless of the "side" you are on.

His legal obligation is to cover the amount needed to repay the settled amount.
He seems to have done that, and done so with a huge portion of the coins remaining. 
Just because you don't like the price going down doesn't change the legality of the situation.

@_date: 2018-02-12 20:52:33
The expectation that everyone who has a dissenting opinion of a product or technology should "nut up and code" is ridiculous.
1.) Not everyone is a developer.
2.) Most developers are going to be nigh on useless on contributing to lightning.
3.) Most of those that would be useful in pushing the tech side of the project forward are already working on it.
Me personally, I've yet to be convinced by the true utility of lightning. Do I think it will end up being the future of payments, who knows, does that mean I'm now required to back that up by jumping into the project and pushing it in the direction I please, no.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:09:53

I never said that I was waiting for anything. I've done plenty of research into lightning and set up a testnet node to try it out.

It's not really possible for a technology like blockchain, as a concept and protocol to fail.
It's certainly possible for cryptocurrencies to not have any significant impact on the world economy and putter along for eternity as a speculative tool to help suck more value out of uninformed or desperate investors.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:53:00
Are you suggesting that the banking system is behind the current bitcoin price? 
The whole point of bitcoin was to subvert said banking system, if it fails at that than I personally see it as a failed experiment. That hasn't quite happened yet.
The current price much more likely has to do with the ridiculous FOMO that the general public bought into late last year. Once that hype faded so did the price.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:38:55
Your "thinking" and "hoping" are nothing but pure speculation. And you are basing your confidence that the price will go up on the hope that it will since you want to see bigger returns for yourself.
I'm not sure that's useful for anyone.
