If he doesn't die before we figure out radical life extension.

I mourned him as much as I mourned fred Rogers. They happened at totally different times in my life, I was a child when he died and a young adult when robin Williams did, but both affected me pretty strongly. When robin Williams died I think something actually changed in my ethos. I was doing a lot of acid at the time, so maybe that helped, but I started trying to be more like him in that respect, trying to keep the childhood wonder I still had left, culltivating more, and sharing it with the people I care about.

I feel like robin's impact was bringing childhood back to the hearts of adults. That's just as valuable. I think he was definitely as wholesome.

Give it 50 years and this tech will be embedded very well, definitely. Don't give it up, just let it he for a time.

I made some small transfers just the other day (well, probably 2 weeks ago), and it took less than 5 min. I definitely upped the tip a bit, but I don't think it came out to more than 0.50 us cents to transfer like 50$. Does it take longer for larger transfers or what?

That sucks. My dad installed Windows 8 over my debian install with my wallet on it then used the computer for months while I was away.

Yup, that honestly bothered me more than the loss of a couple grand
