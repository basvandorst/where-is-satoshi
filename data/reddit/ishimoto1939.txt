amount of transactions with small usd volume is dropping
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:07:34
why would a miner pay high fees if he can mine his own transactions? high fees are for people who want to buy the miners service (mining)
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:16:19


such as ...?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:27:17
ethereum doesn't have blocksize limit, educate yourself
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:09:23
high fees will keep miners mining and secure the chain
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:45:43
good morning,
there are POS currencies based on proof of research, used for voluntary scientific computation
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:32:06
how much u mined is irrelevant, and so is my karma.
if enough hashpower leaves bitcoin difficulty will drop to keep block times steady.
miners can come and go, the code is build to handle that.
stop spreading fud.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:45
mining difficulty doesn't always increase, it is a function of the past hashrate, educate yourself
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:54
i am not here to sell you an alt-coin, 
do your own research of max confirmation times on other chains
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:54:52
yeap all decentralized systems have high fees, keep telling yourself that
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:51:22
you are looking at the small mempool node, here is the big one
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:32
what if I show you a graph instead?
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:13:00
But at what cost, at what cost?!?
@_date: 2018-10-30 08:01:24
Good that you let us know, capitalist 
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:46:21
There are more important things than some coin being worth something. Your mentality is cryptos biggest problem.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:41:28
the risk OP is pointing at is a bank run. 
you can't test robustness against a bank run with $5. 
the scaling is non-linear.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:02:08
The one with the core planet and fees was funnier.
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:19:04
except for tone vay who can send his unit around at near zero cost bcs he knows some miners
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:06:55
bump it up
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:59:33
If you cared about the truth you wouldn't be straw-manning the argument by bringing ludicrous conspiracy theorist into this. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:00:35
then get mining, i guess?
@_date: 2019-12-07 19:27:26
So the speed of the transaction shown here can change depending on how many hops it do to reach the final destination? How long would such a search take usually?
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:16:08
site blocks my adblocker: not cool
@_date: 2019-12-07 01:45:33
Do I have to open a channel with the snack machine?
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:50:38
your test is not not perfect but meaningless. it's like kicking your tires to check the pressure.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:07:08
need to educate yourself about the history of banking, sound too gullible for someone involved in crypto. i'm out.
@_date: 2019-04-28 09:48:33
Slow transaction speeds give you time to reflect on your poor purchase choices.
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:10:33
You think bitcoins grow on trees?
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:53:38
or you implement voting in your wallet and vote on such issues like, you know, normal people 
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:07:44
a single guy invents blockchain currency, 100 geniuses come up with an update which amounts to nothing  but "put it on tab mate" :D
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:27:31
meh why bother, u seem to have figured out everything by yourself already
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:11:59
and that's why PoS/PoR and all those other stuff were invented
but i guess you cant teach an old dog new tricks
keep coding in fortran, or even assembly, be true to your core
@_date: 2019-01-30 23:10:46
valid point is valid
@_date: 2019-01-23 23:23:51
cool story bro
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:31:59
If bitcoins are made in China and the article is about China then... You do the math
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:56:30
is that an atm chain? when you have many atms in the city they usually compete to give a rate closer to the market. they do put a commision though, so i would agree you can't get in on "small" dips
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:59:35
"no way for people to buy the dip"?
you can buy bitcoins on atms 24/7 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:51:05
use a wallet app (such as mycelium) where you can pump up the transaction fee and then you will get confirmations 
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:57:42
suppose i am making transactions during the split. is there a way to express my preference towards one chain or the other? if there is, am I helping the chain grow longer with my transaction or is the speed of chain growth determined by hashpower (i thought that is irrelevant due to adaptive difficulty level)
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:08:31
bragging about 10h transaction times, woow
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:38:26
Selfish miner detected
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:00:55
can be done and is being done are two different things.
you seem to be interested in theory, which to me means very little unless accompanied by practical implementations.
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:30:10
How does she know it's not gonna drop to 2k next week?
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:56:22
Whaaat, you can actually do that??? Sorry my bad, we are definitely going to mine asteroids then. Opened my eyes!!
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:52:27
then let me elaborate further, this particular website allows you to rent a computer as soon as you pay. that's why, in practical terms, my transaction was cleared in 2 seconds because i had access to the computer as soon as i paid. i literally used it for 2 hours and i was done. what goes on the backend is irrelevant, they could be backing up every 2 weeks or writing each other letters via pigeons to re-confirm and bla bla. i don't care, paid in 2 seconds, got my job done, finished.
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:36:51
economics of scales makes it cheaper to buy in bulk, so entry for new comers is difficult
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:40:07
the ignorance is strong with this one.
you know why shit is more abundant underground? bcs it aint worth digging up...
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:38:11
the comments section is hilarious :D






I am out ...✌️⬇️��﻿
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:55:26
when was the last time you used a credit card? bcs i just bought 2 hour computer time on [vast.ai]( and it cleared like in 2 seconds.
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:25:43
so the transaction rate is the rate of mined (confirmed) transactions, not the rate of broadcasted (unconfirmed) transactions?
@_date: 2019-05-24 10:02:48
read the article. it says she mined and sold for fiat. so no hedging, just good old thieving.
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:21:18
maybe you have a miner friend? bcs fees for the rest of us are definitely more than $3  
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:26:50
somebody has been reading too much science fiction
@_date: 2019-05-28 00:15:38
wow, good thing that lightning didn't bring the rocket down...  
waiiit a minuteee...!
