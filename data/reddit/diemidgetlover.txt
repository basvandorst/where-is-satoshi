I'm not saying it will reach $1mil, but if we ever get there, then the number of maximum decimal places will likely increase.

Yeah, another post afterwards about SENS gathered more visibility, maybe it was yours. Then Aubrey showed up and commented on both posts. Good job, man :)

Please consider donating to the SENS Foundation, which focuses on curing aging-related diseases. Let's HODL literally forever :)

Please elaborate if you can! I am not Dutch, but I have a Dutch bank account from the days I was studying there, I actually used that very account to send money to Coinbase when I bought my first BTC.

I'm so fucking proud of this, I was the first person to suggest SENS at the Pineapple fund donation thread. I am a published scientist with 3 university degrees, but that post was probably the highlight of my contribution to science! Thank you Pineapple fund, and thank you Bitcoin!

That would be awesome. Imagine BTC goes to $49,666 or something. Not only you win the bet, you pretty much do a x6 at your BTC investment as well.

I spent the last few months holding about half of my BCH airdrop as a hedge, but a few weeks ago I decided to dump it at the next pump as a matter of principle. Finally got rid of it about an hour ago, good riddance!
 Gonna get myself some ARK with the profits (shameless shill)

I'd take Baldrick's slug balancing act over Charlie Chaplin any day.

Perhaps you mean BRIAN BLESSED?

Sure, just don't go pasting your private key on random internet sites.

Do you think it has a chance to go back to 10% eventually? I feel that since Coinbase added XRP and other coins, newcomers who would have bought ETH in the past will now have many more options..

I remember some guy calling BTC the "Great Filter" coin exactly because of that. But I think that mining using for example excess hydro or solar (that would otherwise go unused) in order to exchange for energy from elsewhere during peak demand times, is a great idea.

Yes, absolutely, my plan is to start swapping when ETH hits 8+%. Best of luck to us!
