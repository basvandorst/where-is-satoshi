These memes starting to irritate me, what is happening to the price is very worrying and no one gives a shit. The futures destroyed the price, they are crushing btc by crushing the price, it will go to below 1k, have a little pump the next halving then continue to go to $10, we need to do something else besides these stupid shit memes. We need the people of 2013 and before who were real fighters for freedom not these soft ass jokers we have now.

The halvings. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:15:40
Because you can buy cheaper at the moment. So better buy now, to sell for 60k. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:22:43
Damn nice said. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:02:29
Great news, every etf that gets denied bitcoin should pump just to fuck with the sec. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:22:10
Thats after bitcoin smashed USD by thousands of %, beat that. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:28:41
Dont worry it will stabilize at $500k

Don't you think Bitcoin should indeed focus more on the younger generation including 12 year olds?
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:23:11
he says its value is a joke, he doesn't understand bitcoin so he should just not comment on something he doesn't get, according to him bitcoin should be worthless. just because ethe guy is a billionaire doesn't mean we have to defend his shitty quote.

The bitcoin foundation should take care of that imo

[I disagree]( the 2.0 technology as extra service layers are useful and giving bitcoin better features than it already has, especially regarding simplicity where bitcoin doesn't really shine.

When i made the new wallet it didnt show me a new seed and didnt ask me to make new password for it, it just opened the new wallet in a new window. Or else im 100% i would have stored them.

One way, fiat to btc. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 09:24:48
This is bs, not gonna happen, their gov is too incompetent for this. They cant even offer water, electricity to their people (giving away to suria, iraq, lebanon), internet connection is very low, majority doesnt even have internet. And you want them to go bitcoin? Nice joke lmao, its the most corrupt country with 1/3 of their population being poor, iranians hate their retarded regime and they like trump bcause there is finally someone who has balls to call their shit out.

I dont think etf will approve, pepare for panic dumps to 5k.

Yeah getting rid of a dictatorship not by trade deal you clueless shit. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:20:29
Why can i not pay from my electrum wallet? It only has option for globee, coinbase and coinpayments which i dont have any account on. Pretty useless if people cannot pay from their own wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-27 11:51:16
We dont give a fck if iran hasnt attacked another country, iran is attacking their own citizens, the cowards, why dont you compare the living circumstances of the citizens of those countries to the living circumstances of citizens in iran? The sanctions are caused by the actions of a dictatorship, and im not going to argue with some loser living in the free society without any clue what iranians inside iran have to go through.. just dont comment moron.
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:44:10
I have 2 wallet files, the first one was called wallet_1 which i have the password of, then i made a second one called default_wallet but upon making this new wallet it didnt ask me to make a new password for it, instead it opened the new wallet in a new window. Now today after updating electrum and buying btc and sending to this new wallet address, it asks me for a password upon sending. While it never asked me to make a password in the first place when i made this new wallet a year ago.
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:52:51
The problem is when i made the new wallet it didnt show me the new seed it just opened the new window wallet. I only have the seed from the first wallet and when i insert this seed it opens my first wallet not the new wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:43:32
Im from iran you dipshit, anyone who is pro iranian regime can go fck himself. You are clueless, sitting on your ass in holland with all freedom acting like you know iran, iranian people stand behind trump, but you european weasels love to have good deal with the dictatorship and dont care about iranians, well we dont give a fck about your economy just like u do t give a fck about ours. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 09:27:23
Who needs etf when we have the halving? Screw sec. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 11:53:26
Well if u back off supporting these backwarded terrorists we might succeed.
@_date: 2018-07-27 11:12:12
No, trade deal wouldnt be best for iran, it all goes in the pocket of the dictatorship and not iranians, it means the dictatorship will stay in power, meaning no freedom, no human rights, no social security, no progress. The iranian government is there to steal irans wealth, they are arabs and are helping their arabs neighbours instead of iran. They give 0 shits about iran, iranians want a revolution, they dont care about trade deals because it wont give them democracy, we back trump because he  is saying out loud what iranians have been feeling and suffering for 40 years, fo you its about your trade deals for trump its about what iranians want, getting rid of the dictatorship, they are incompetent and corrupt, very backwarded. Also if you care about trade deals with iran wouldnt it be better to support a regime that bring democracy and progress? A better regime that cares for iran will open many investment and trade opportunities for europe. I dont get europe why they keep supporting this brutal regime, trump administration calls them out thats why we like him. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:27:17
Thank you, we like americans and want to have a good relationship but our gov has isolated us from the world, we look forward for the deatch of this non iranian regime. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:06:28
I just did but it only restores wallet_1 balance not default_wallet where my btc is in. When i made default_wallet it didnt ask me to make a new password or showed me a new seed at all, it just opened a new window with the new wallet (default_wallet), now after i updated electrum it asks me for a password upon sending from default_wallet. I only have password and seed of wallet_1 not default_wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:24:07
wow i just found the seed, omg, i all forgot about the writing the seed process.
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:38:14
It doesnt do anything when i press ok, the password window just dissapears.
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:32:44

This is utterly retarded, if there is a real world purpose where users need to buy the coin for, than it has value. Bitcoin is an app coin too if you think about it.

bigger would be mcdonalds, starbucks, burger king etc accepting it.

Thats dogecoin scam for you, making you fall into the trap that you have lots of money hah.
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:45:40
dogecoiners are good at hugging a bitcoiners nuts. The coin only distracts people from real innovations happening.
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:21:48


Turns out you can only use it with your facebook account, fail.
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:09:50
just saw it, it only connects with fb users and if your fb gets hacked you are in trouble so not something im looking for, i like getgems so far.
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:14:48
wtf is this shitty monacoin? seems it has no real innovation aswell it has a retarded catface on it, how can it have a 3m market cap.

@_date: 2015-03-02 21:02:20

@_date: 2015-03-02 20:14:56
Is it with commands or how do you send bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-13 00:46:02
In China from what i've seen they care less about thriving Bitcoin technology/adoption and spreading the good word, they care more about just making money out of it and its sad they are deciding the price now. Props to the US that they are also caring about building a legit Crypto infrastructure and i hope they will take the lead soon. In China they only have some exchanges and margin trading, bunch of careless gamblers. Real bitcoin innovations will be in the west.
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:03:43
got you just downloaded getgems looks good so far.
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:40:03
something like getgems i mean thanks.
