I will definitely find out if/how I can get the bigger ones. I use snus myself and I'd prefer the big ones, sometimes with these I have to put two pouches at the same time.

Thanks for feedback! I will update the site with more information shortly.
One portion is 3mg of nicotine. If I get some orders I'll try to get the bigger pouches also. Now I have to go through a third party that only carries the small ones.
I ship from Thailand. Me and some of my friends have shipped to Europe for friends before, and they seem to go through customs fine.

What if, when pirate knows if his ponzi will default before that, just bets enought on the winning side to buy almost all of the losing side?

There's a lot of transactions with binary decimals (ie. 0.01100111)
If you convert these binary numbers to ascii characters, you get the message "So long and thanks for all the fish"
edit: Oh sorry, i just set my RES to hide child comments by default, so I didn't notice that this was already answered, and then I doubleposted as I didn't see my own comment :D
