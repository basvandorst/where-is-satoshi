EDIT: In reading your other comment, I am not sure if I interpreted your statements correctly. Could you clarify the point you are arguing? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:33:54
What do you think slowed growth is? Lmfao!

If by “air” you mean the full faith and credit of a government that has never defaulted on its debt and and whose debt is instrumental in the entire global financial system, then yes, air. We can all appreciate technological progress without spewing retarded, uninformed bullshit. Statements like that prevent anyone from taking you seriously.
Additionally, what is bitcoin backed by? The advantage of fiat currency is there is no wasted utility from foregoing whatever you could use the material/asset to “back” the currency for. It also allows much more flexible monetary policy implementations. If you disagree with the arguments and empirical evidence for the positives of fiat currency, or the scale at which they are believed, that is a perfectly reasonable opinion that people will listen to you defend. If you say “your money isn’t real, crypto future” then people will rightly assume you’re an idiot

And yet the exact thing that saved us in 2008 was monetary policy made possible through fiat currency. Meanwhile bitcoin has dropped, what, 60+% from its peak with no way of stabilizing its volatility? Your arguments do not make sense. I will never understand why even though we can all agree on the amazing potential for bitcoin and it’s underlying technology there’s always the select group of fiat conspiracists a la you who just make the entire group look completely idiotic by refuting basic economic and empirical facts.
Did you purchase anything with US dollars today? Oh wow look it worked even with $20 trillion in debt. Do you think it’d be better if the treasury was $20 trillion in debt in the form of bitcoin? You make 0 logical sense.

LMFAO! I’m just waiting for your ninja edits. I screenshotted all of this in anticipation

When you originally said disappeared I initially took it as referring to the total money supply. Now I understand you’re referring to the currency’s themselves. That was my area of confusion. 
As far as what you’re saying, it’s a straw man. The fiats disappeared because the country’s economies or governments collapsed. There are plenty of no longer existing currencies from failed countries that were backed with assets as well.
It’s I not the fiat that failed, it’s the governments, economies and country’s themselves.

But bitcoin doesn’t require the same belief/feedback loop? Economic slowdown is positive for mankind? You legitimately have no concept of how economics or a monetary system works. Good luck to you.
