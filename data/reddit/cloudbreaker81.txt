This is exactly what the elites are up to but whose checking on them? They own the drugs trades. Do people think their isn't a rich man in a suit and tie behind the biggest drugs operations? What are most wars fought for too? For looting resources. They don't want you doing what they are doing and cutting into their wealth and means of gaining more.
The people actually have the power as we outnumber them by billions but we are far too stupid and believe they actually work for us and have our best interests at heart. A few rich old men are able to manipulate billions of people into believing and doing whatever they want us to. Let that sink in for a moment.

Any stocks to look at that are about to go big?

I don't think anyone can say that with any real confidence. Could see centralised coins take its place. The Value of bitcoin is no indication of its long term survival.

There's a very simple answer here, the whole financial system and governments are controlled by a group of very wealthy people, if you cut them out of the loop, they lose money. Do you think they like losing money? The system was never set up to favour the masses. When the prospect of seeing the tables turned, I don't think these guys are going away without trying to address the balance and tilt it back in their favour.

Where you gonna go to cash in your valuable bitcoin for fiat currency? Take a guess. They still hold the keys until crypto replaces fiat and that's not happening any time soon.  (I believe in Crypto but banks and governments are very much in the loop still)

Penny cryptos seem to get dragged down by Bitcoin so people are looking at this crash like, damn ok

Bitcoin is ridiculous right now. The fees are killing it. I can't even mine $10 worth on Kryptex (similar to NiceHash) as the network fees are like $7 so I'd get $3 from every $10. No thanks. Mining VertCoin now and exchanging for other coins.

They need ID verification. A shit load of verification to be honest. They claim there is a limited amount you can buy as unverified but when you try and do it, you can't because you are below the minimum amount so have to get verified with some forms of ID proof of ID and address and everything else in between to be able to properly use this site.
