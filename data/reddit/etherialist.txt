OP asked for a legal avenue for streaming copyright media. Popcorn Time uses bittorrent; therefore when you stream a video with PT, you also become a peer in that torrent's swarm and upload that media to other people as you are watching. This is NOT legal and in certain countries (JAPAN) there are relatively severe repercussions for doing so.

it is no better a way to distribute a film than bittorrent itself is, as it is using public bittorrent swarms to get the streaming done. The elegance lies in the client and it's ability to download and stream with one click; which often results in the user not understanding what is actually going on.
This is what's going on:
You're joining a public bittorrent swarm, making your IP address visible to any copyright trolls that are monitoring the swarm. As you get partway into watching the movie, you have already become a distributor of the copyright material because you are uploading the movie to peers in the swarm. These peers could include copyright trolls and in countries like Japan the financial repercussions for getting caught are not worth the risk of using such an elegant system.

you dont have to use the addresses connected to the wallet's seed. go to bitaddress.org and generate as many private keys as you need in the Bulk Wallet section, then import them into Electrum from the Settings menu. The imported keys are impossible to retrieve with the seed so make sure you keep a safe and secure backup of the wallet file if you do this!
Honestly though i do believe they would be safe but its your money so you need to make the decision

I bought in April at $80/btc and through some pretty stupid, uninformed and emotionally (greed) driven trades, lost about half of them. After resolving to only sell during media driven crashes, and buying back after the price (hopefully) drops, I've increased my investment by a factor of 4, if I sell at the current rate. Admittedly i have not significantly increased my bitcoins since having the resolution but i have not lost any either.
I, like many others in this subreddit, believe in the potential for bitcoins to go well beyond $1k per coin, but no one can predict the future and you are still taking a risk whatever way you look at it.
In retrospect, if i had just sat on the coins, i would have much more to play around with, but i wouldnt be playing with them at that point, would i? :)

you probably did not lose the money as long as you have a backup of your wallet. When a wallet is created with bitcoin-qt it pre-generates 100 addresses and displays the first one to you. when you sent the .008btc to the new address, it also sent 69.915 btc to one of the 100 addresses it had pre-generated. If you saved your wallet file after the transaction, then the 70BTC will still be in your wallet, in a hidden change address that bitcoin-qt is using. If you did not save your wallet after the transaction but have a backup wallet file, your 69.9915 coins are waiting for you in one of the pre-generated addresses in the wallet. You can use software like pywallet to analyze the wallet file and figure out where your change went

It's not really an online wallet but if you use the [Elecrtrum]( bitcoin client, you can always recover you wallet using the [mnemonic seed]( that it first gives you when it generates your wallet. So all you need to do is remember the twelve word code it gives you in case you ever lose your wallet file. It's also a useful lightweight client because it retrieves the blockchain info from a server instead of downloading the entire chain to your harddrive like the bitcoin-qt client.

Buying through an exchange is probably the cheapest way to buy bitcoins. You will always pay a commission fee when you make a trade through an exchange and the commission is usually a little higher than half a percent.  There are also usually fees associated with depositing and withdrawing funds from your exchange account. Purchasing bitcoins through other means usually results in paying more fees.

you are looking at a 34 digit address contained within your bitcoin wallet. The address can be used to send bitcoins to your wallet or to view the balance of the particular address. In order to spend the coins, you need the associated private key, which typical bitcoin clients do not allow you to view without using advanced features.
The easiest way to 'back up' bitcoins to a paper wallet is to securely generate an address &amp; private key pair and transfer the bitcoins you want to save to the bitcoin address of the private key. The private key is only used when you want to spend the bitcoins, and generally should not be used afterwards (unless you know what you're doing, see [reddit's understanding change addresses](
I personally like and recommend the following website for paper wallet generation:
They also include helpful information for beginners. Have fun!

The public key is the bitcoin address so when you make make a transaction and your bitcoin address(public key) gets broadcast, you are not compromising that address's security in any way.

As has been already said, you will likely see a return on your investment in less than a year if the exchange rate of bitcoin continues to rise. However, we (i bought a jalapeno 1st April) could have acquired much more bitcoins just by buying coins on the order date rather than mining with the hardware that takes forever to ship. Nonetheless, you help strengthen the network (even just by a little) by running your miner, so it's sort of a fun experiment.

New bitcoins are created when a block is mined. After a certain time interval, the reward for finding the next block is halved. In the year 2140 the reward for finding a block will be 0. However, when a block is found, all the transactions since the previous block are recorded into the new block. When a transaction is recorded into a block, the fees from that transaction are added to the reward for finding that block. Therefore, in the year 2140 when the base block reward is 0, it will still be rewarding to mine blocks because the transactions since the previous block could be in the millions and the associated fees would also be quite large.

[Namecoins]( are based on bitcoins and were developed to enable the purchase of uncensored domains. The idea behind them is great but the implementation is... lacking. It has to do with the reason they were developed; a sort of hacked together solution for a development competition in which bitcoins were the prize.
Basically you can purchase a fairly large(i think) amount of year long .bit domain names for 1 NMC (or just purchase 1 for a fraction of a NMC) and people can type in your human readable .bit domain to display your website. However, in order for their DNS list to list .bit domains, they must use a proxy or a namecoin DNS server. [link](
You can earn namecoins in Slush simply by [generating a namecoin address]( and typing it into your namecoin address in your settings. Namecoins are generated the same way as bitcoins, so the same shares you generate for bitcoins also work for namecoins. Therefore you can generate namecoins in addition to bitcoins without any additional work/effort! Although namecoin skepticism seems higher than even that of BTC and i'm not at all sure but i think it woudl take over 100 Namecoins to buy a bitcoin.

They cannot do anything with those coins until the case against the site and it's operator(s) is completed. The primary suspect does not appear to be caving very quickly, and even if he did the case would still take a while to close. Further, it is unlikely they would crash the market with a huge sell order all at once, it would be more logical to do it over time, which would still decrease the value but that would in turn increase demand and price would stabilize eventually.

It depends on what client you use to send the 5 BTC out of your paper wallet. Most clients will send the 5 BTC to the desired address then make you a new random address to send the change to. Electrum lets you disable change addresses so the extra change will be sent back to the original paper wallet address.
If you send 5 BTC out of the 100 BTC paper wallet with bitcoin-qt and dont save a backup of the wallet file afterwards, the 95 BTC change could be lost forever in the change address that was randomly generated after the transaction was made. Bitcoin-qt does this behind the scenes so it is quite confusing and easy to not comprehend this important 'feature'
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:33:34
Wow that even has fewer inputs and if i'm not mistaken could have been made without any fee at all.

Your exchange account stores USD and Bitcoins separately for you. When you purchase bitcoins with your depsited USD, the amount you spent, plus fees, are deducted from your USD amount and the bitcoins are credited to your BTC amount. you will then end it up with both USD and BTC amounts in your exchange account.

Essentially, yes. When you write down the private key, it is a good idea to write it with the address (even though the address can be re-generated from the private key, if necessary). Hide the private key (by folding it like in [bitcoinpaperwallet]( in storage in a way that is tamper-evident (a quick snapshot of the private key with a digital device can compromise your paper wallet without the thief having to take possession of the paper wallet).

If you cant figure it out then i'm sorry but maybe you shouldnt be trading in your hard worked money for bitcoins. If you're still determined to do something you can hardly understand, figure out how to fund your bitfloor or bitstamp account with your hard earned money, then trade that in for the amount of bitcoins you want, ......., profit!

despite it's apparent bad reputation around here, [campbx]( filled my sell order immediately without any issues (this time, no DDOS, yay)

I see you're mining in the Slush Pool. That's the pool I started in not long ago. I just made the move to [BitMinter]( because they have a fee percentage amount that you can customize (i'm greedy, i'm donating 0% fees). They are one of the lowest fee pools with enough hash power to find a few blocks every day. I seem to make around the same amount of bitcoins as i did on Slush but i make 10x the amount of namecoins for some reason. I highly recommend making the switch!
Unfortunately BitMinter is instituting a [1% fee]( on my favorite holiday. I expect to stay with them as that's still really low and the only other low fee pool i know of, [MtRed]( suffers from occasional downtime.

If i had just mined one block 3 years ago... I'd have enough to buy that car... bitcoin really is amazing

While it was not instant, I recently used [CampBX]( to purchase bitcoins via USPS money order. If you're located in the USA, I highly recommend them as they seem to have the lowest fees and they have not been the target of the recent DDOS/price manipulation attacks. No verification of any kind was needed (I could have even used a made up name and a randomly selected address) as I was purchasing less than $1000 USD. I sent the money order via regular snail mail on Friday morning and was credited the money to my account the next Thursday. CampBX will also accept [Dwolla]( transfers for bitcoin, which are even cheaper than money orders and only take 6 hours. However, you will need a Dwolla account with your checking account info in it for at least 30 days before you can use that transfer method.
I dont think there's many or any ways to instantly buy bitcoins online without jumping through hoops of some sort. Your best bet for instant bitcoins is to look around on a site like  and buy some from a trusted bitcoin seller in your area.

if electrum continues to reject your new password, you can recover your wallet from your seed if you wrote it down when you created your wallet. Just click File&gt;Create/Restore and follow the prompts to recover from seed.

Dont worry about downloading the blockchain, Electrum works fine, and your coins are safe even if all the blockchain servers in the server list go down. If that ever happens(doubtful) , open the Electrum Settings and click the Import/Export tab and export your private keys. It will save them in a csv file(open with a text editor) in "address,private_key" format. Then you can [import the keys to bitcoin-qt]( and use your coins normally from that client. You can use blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info to check your address balances any time.  
I use both bitcoin-qt and Electrum and prefer electrum for it's feature set (doesnt dumb things down) but use bitcoin-qt primarily anyway since i prefer to have my own blockchain record.
