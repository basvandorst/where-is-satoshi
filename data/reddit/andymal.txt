I started out loving the idea of btc 6 years ago but now I'm not really a fan. There are much better coins out there that will crush btc in the long term.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:11:59
Your first comment didn't confuse me. Some people are really fast to attack without even thinking.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:20:39
How does it make sense to do the super difficult optimizations first? From an engineers perspective this is insanity. If the block size has to increase anyway why didn't 2x happen? Could have saved a lot of fees and pushing people to alts and BCH.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:07:58
BCH doesn't update difficulty every 2016 blocks... what u smoking?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:33:24
I agree. There are certainly coins with more innovation and just the will to make changes that will help in the short term while working on long term plans. If btc can't figure out something soon it will not continue to lead.
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:40:21
If btc can never hard fork it's doomed. Even scaling solutions like lightning will require bigger blocks eventually.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:55:35
r/Bitcoin hates on coinbase for adding BCH before Segwit is the only reason this is news to them. Every crypto exchange charges trading fees.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:06:08
What does this have to do with coinbase? don't they all charge trading fees?
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:14:06
That's a lot of typing. Think anyone will read it? Lol

You're telling me tor operates without exit nodes? I'm the one who doesn't understand it... huh.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:28:21
The fee market has always been part of cores plan. How long have you been around? The Bitcoin whitepaper describes a way to scale. Have you read it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:49:19
You think there are only 20-30k "legitimate" transactions? What is that per day? LOL
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:01
How would they benefit from not mining the high fee transactions now? You make no sense.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:13:54
Wow this is insanity... who believes it will go straight up forever? This is the exact same thing that happened with the 1k spike back in the day. But I bet you weren't around for that were you?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:16:08
No one gets data if there are no exits.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:14:56
They're not a problem. Miners are putting the highest fee transactions into blocks first. There are just too many high fee transactions to keep up so the price keeps going up and up. This guy doesn't understand how mining works.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:42:32
My point is that keeping 1mb is turning off thousands of users and merchants to btc every day. With so many other options in crypto we can't afford to wait for magic scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:59:13
Part 7 implies allowing bigger than 1mb blocks. 1mb was never meant to be permanent.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:41
That means people are willing to pay more to get their transaction through. Working as intended.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:46:24
Maybe we should add code to only allow moving coins once a month to cut down on "spam"?!
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:16:47
Low fee transactions aren't pushing up the price. High fee transactions are, which are legitimate transactions. If people trying to use their btc is spam then there is a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:38:17
I guess if people wanting to move and use their btc is spam then there is a bigger problem. There is no scaling solution that can work on 1mb in the long run, so as a stop gap a block size increase would be a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:50:59
The majority of the block reward is still in the coinbase reward even with fees this high. So fucking up the network for high fees would definitely hurt them.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:58:45
If btc could keep up with the legitimate transactions this would not be possible.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:01:08
I'm not sure people spending tens of millions in BTC on fees should be called spam...
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:22:36
This is a good way to get sent to jail. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:44:41
What is the point? People are getting so desperate to move their coins that the fees are now over 1000 sat/byte. How is that spam? The network simply cannot keep up!
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:17:54
You're way off. A year ago I could send a TX for less than 100 sat/byte and now it's climbing past 1000 sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:26
There were no sell orders on gdax so it went crazy. They fixed this already.

Just sent $40. What else can we do to help other than donating?
Edit: I am interested in the bumper sticker as well!

@_date: 2014-02-01 20:55:26
Good point. You can see that I sent $25 to it but that doesn't prove it. Anyway, you can just use fake info. It just bothered me that I couldn't just send to an address.
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:02:49
It looks like even if you have insurance it's still cheaper this way...

Are people investing? Looks like a donation page to me. Also this technology isn't untested. It is actually used in other countries. Drug companies here don't care about it because they can't make billions on it.

American insurance is not controlled by the American people. Nor is the government which controls the insurance. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:27:54
Guessing they want your info so they can send out news and or offers.
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:30:04
How can you tell they just bought them?

If this were available through a doctor I would get it tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:32:48
+1 Part of the reason I like to donate in btc is not having to give out any info.
@_date: 2014-10-30 23:15:57
I'd rather have it pay the site owners directly rather than the advertiser. This way they are less reliant on ad revenue.

Cnbc video is a horrible experience! Hit play once and forwarded to the actual video, press play 2 more times and im forwarded to full page add, go back and hit play twice again and then a video add starts. No thanks I'm done.

It would be nice if I could donate without putting in my personal info.

There is more than just that. I'd rather not be donating to PayPal or Visa as well when attempting to donate to a cause I believe in.

My doctor thought I was joking when I said I'd get my inhalers elsewhere because they don't even make generic ones. Wasn't kidding...

There is no way a short term capacity increase "breaks bitcoin". If it could not survive another H-F then it's too weak or too corrupted to be viable in the first place. I work as a software engineer and sometimes temporary solutions are necessary to maintain your user base until the real fix can be completed. Doing a capacity increase now and a better long term scaling solution later are not mutually exclusive. On the fees - So you think the current fees are acceptable? Are these the fees we should expect to have once we have lightning? If so I don't envision many people using it...
@_date: 2016-01-26 01:14:00
Why are comment votes still hidden on this sub? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:30:18
It seems like this is a critical time for bitcoin to continue to take on more volume so even a short term solution would help investors continue to put money into bitcoin projects and keep new users from being put off by large fees and delays. If the tires on your car were so worn down that they were about to explode, you'd replace them even if you could only get ones of a similar size. You would not wait so long while planning for your monster truck tires that the worn out ones blow up and you crash.
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:21:59
It requires you to validate a withdrawal with 2 email addresses and wait 48 hours. They send you many notifications over those 2 days that a withdrawal is pending so it's pretty tough to get hacked and have someone steal your coins if they're in the vault wallet.

Coinbase can support whatever they want. They have no obligation to anyone but their share holders. Thinking a correlation between bch price and btc fees was malicious is borderline conspiracy theory. Seems more likely that all cryptos were up and btc was at capacity.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:24:18
This needs to be top comment. People are acting like this guy sold a few hundred dollars of btc to his buddy one time. He was definitely breaking the law and is now fucking over his own defense. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:41:56
Why is it so hard to believe that there were more than 7 legitimate TPS for a while when the price was almost 20x it's previous ATH? Maybe there was some spam but I honestly think people were mostly just doing a lot of transactions. 
Oh and about the coinbase part - why would they decide to do that? They're a business and it makes no sense to incur a ton of high fees to hurt the network that makes them all their money. Be logical.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:29:05
Tons of people actually using and trading btc? This was during the end of the huge run up...
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:04:58
