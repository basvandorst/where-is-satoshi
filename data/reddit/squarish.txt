Would you count the profit a grocery store makes on selling a product as a "hidden fee"?
It's basically the same thing. They have to get their cut somewhere, but the user/customer is presented with exactly what exchange rate they will be getting for each transaction.

I think we should lobby to get BTC delisted from Coinbase. Tell them they can't make continue to make money from BTC if they aren't going to follow what Core wants. Free the beast!

It is the community of Bitcoiners that think on-chain scaling by blocksize increase is better than SegWit + off-chain scaling. The subreddit existed long before Bitcoin Cash. It was created because many users in this subreddit are banned for asking the wrong questions or disagreeing with the Core devs.

I guess we will all know in a few years time. If Bitcoin continues to be stagnated like it has for the last year or so, I would (and have) bet money other cryptos will be superior by then.

I find it hilarious that people still don't understand how/why the fees are calculated. Yet they talk as if they are subject matter experts.

Nothing. The only clown car is the one Mow is riding in.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:51:03
So someone that believes in Bitcoin should NEVER EVER be interested in any other type of crypto currency? What kind of thinking is that?

Probably a stupid question, but can any of these hardware wallets be used with Mycelium (or other mobile wallet)?
I always see them plugged into PCs
@_date: 2016-06-29 17:49:27
Thanks for the explanation. One of the many reasons I'm sticking with Mycelium!

Then why did I pay $1.24 in fees to move some BTC out of Coinbase? (Serious question)
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:31:07
OK, that makes sense. Thank you for the quick answer :)

IMO, I think there is going to be a slow build up to a tidal wave by next October when the mining rewards halve. This is only the beginning.
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:28:45
There is a customizable fee you send with your transactions to the bitcoin network. This is to reward miners that participate in the network to process your transaction.
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:58:35
Thanks for the great guide! It will be useful when I try a similar project later this year.
2 Questions:
Do you know what the max distance can be between the 21(DIY) computer and the sensor?
Has anyone purchased data from you yet? How does this part work (i.e. do you set the price)? Bitcoin in its current form doesn't seem to be a good avenue for micropayments, so I am most curious about this part.
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:29:57
More likely they want you to wait for your first purchase, but purchases thereafter are 0 conf. Just a guess though.

@_date: 2013-06-04 23:02:37
I never said they sold bitcoins. I said there is a distinct possibility that they are mining with the hardware they have manufactured, without shipping to the actual customer. The BTC price increase is only further motivation to mine with the hardware.
@_date: 2013-05-23 02:40:33
Ah yes, I forgot about that. I should have remembered that, considering I was part of the 50BTC pool for awhile.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:02:30
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:56:33
I guess not, but it would be funny to see all that BTC fall out of circulation.
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:45:50
I don't care that he makes money from it, he should. I think it's lame that he is hoarding his bitcoins, which does nothing to promote the usefulness of the currency.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:44:40
Looks like current estimates are around 1/10th or $20m-$50m depending on what hardware and power/personnel costs.
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:31:01
I just googled and found another thread @ Bitcointalk.org from TODAY
Which contains this post by SGExodus:
















60k Bitcoins @ $125 is only $7.5m
Assume you need 2-5 times the hashing power of the current network, and it still comes in under $50m
@_date: 2013-06-03 20:35:57
I was actually getting excited about them shipping and was going to place an order for a 5Ghs model, but then I head they were selling chips. Fuck this company, I 'd rather buy bitcoins directly at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:07:09
Basically the text is a slightly different color, but close enough that at regular viewing angles it blends in. When you look from an off-angle view, the color differences are much more apparent.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:14:22
No, I think he should use it as a currency just like the rest of us. The article implies that he has spent only 500 BTC since it's inception, which is not much considering it's value has only recently skyrocketed. I don't see how you can think that ANYONE holding 8-10% of all bitcoins is a good thing?
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:28:27
I don't know. I'm just looking at the data. Data shows there is a lot of mining going on in BFL-town. Everything else is up to interpretation.

Oh, my mistake. The pikachu picture says "Bieber for President" in the middle of his face.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:13:47
Some people are concerned that there are entities in the world (governments, etc.) that would try to make bitcoin fail. I could easily see the US govt spending $500m on a cutting edge ASIC farm designed purely to fork the blockchain and create havoc. It just depends how threatened they feel by BTC
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:06:19
Hmm, interesting. I thought I read somewhere that for some of the "ASICminer" commodities, partial shares could be converted into whole. I'm pretty new to this stuff so maybe I was just confused.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:52:42
I can't even login. What a joke site.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:18:24
It would also be interesting if the vending machines had ASICs or FPGAs in them to mine for the network as well. Vending company can profit from selling products and mining at the same time.

Also, SatoshiDice isn't burdened with user accounts and the security issues that comes with them. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:16:34
I don't think anyone believes that we will actually see a revelation in economic theory any time soon. I think they just included it because that would be an event that could fork the block chain. Bitcoin is just another economic experiment, but in 50 years we may learn something new from it.
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:50:36
Yeah, someone did a test with Amazon EC2 and found that is was not profitable.
@_date: 2013-05-29 21:22:34
Thanks! I did some digging around on btct.co and they have some pretty good explanations of what each type of share is if you click on the share type. Seems to be exactly as you say. The only thing I can't seem to get clear info on is (voting rights?) and turning 1/100th shares into whole shares.
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:12:03
You don't even have to look at the block chain.
Look at the US on the globe...
...and compare that big red spike with BFL's location
@_date: 2013-07-01 20:39:21
I hate that about Amazon. I pretty much only buy the items that say "sold by Amazon" unless I want to take time to look at the seller's feedback.
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:26:53
I did not. Still seems sketchy when your company hasn't delivered product in a year, while the value of BTC is 10 times what it was when they first offered a pre-order. Running your own pool would be the perfect cover for that type of operation.
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:31:18
That is good info for dealing with large amounts of cash. TIL
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:58:21
The biggest things that will drive up the price of BTC are # of people using it and halving the rewards from mining. It is a currency that is designed to gradually increase in value over the next 100 years.

If true, what a dick. While everyone else is out promoting and using BTC, he's just sitting on it while the value rises. I hope he loses his wallet ID

Technically, anything below 0C or 32F is freezing. No one cares what you "think" is freezing.

The pool pays *everyone* when **anyone** in the pool finds a block. But those with less powerful miners would normally take well over a year to find a block on their own, where in a pool they can earn fractions of the block rewards fairly often.

It will, along with the mining rewards halving every so often.

Apparently I need to reiterate. I do not want nor expect him to dump his coins. But if we all used bitcoins the way he has, then I don't think we would have an effective currency.
