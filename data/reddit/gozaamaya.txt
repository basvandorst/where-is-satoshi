This is why the price is dropping. User base only cares about hodling and not actual improvement. No one has faith in the community.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:53:30
Because there are no fundamentals behind BTC and plenty of better coins.
There are 1000 others out there, and people are going to bet on the first one that came out, just because everyone knows it’s name.
At some point your betting on what everyone else thinks.
Or maybe even refusing to change your bets no matter what. You’re not even betting anymore, it’s more about pride.
What happens when they change their mind?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:02:35
and then they say HODL hahaa.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:43:05
its part of the reason for the crash. btc sucks
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:30
It’s protecting you from losing money
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:03:15
How do you make profit if you hold forever?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:10
Within 1 hr it’s at 17,000
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:30:48
Think it will now
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:09:26
How will you afford the trx fees?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:01:18
well at least it wasn't $2,000
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:16:39
Why not just get more money in cash and buy BTC then? Why would you want to be paid in BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:39:47
It’s called “falsification” and is actually the only way to prove a truth.
For example to prove that all swans are white, you cannot just find more white swans. You have to fail to find a swan that is not white.

Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:59:12
Just hoping for some smart people on this side. Trying to form my own opinions, not jumping to conclusions.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:23:27
What did they want?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:43:36
How are smaller blocks more security? Less magnitude of error and risk with each block?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:11:36
When it happened back in the day, how did it turn out?
Was a dangerous competitor present (like BCH)?
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:03:40
What qualifies as a shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:38:01
One way or another there is a lot of hash power in that room.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:41:16
Why not? What are the cons??
Are you just saying it’s too good to be true so you don’t want it??
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:48:17
I haven’t made any arguments. Just asked questions.
Do you have any opinions on why you like BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:37:07
“The death spiral stems from the fact that Bitcoin only allows a difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks, so if you lose so much hashpower to another chain that it becomes practically unheard of to generate another block, then you will never make it to the next difficulty adjustment within a usable amount of time. The chain dies.
Technically an emergency fork can be put together as fast as the code can be written and an update pushed out to miners and users, but testing and governance issues could delay it. Since it's an existential fork, I'm sure all the stops would be pulled.”
That’s what I’ve heard, but I know you can’t believe everything hear. I’m here to learn more and learn the truth.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:51:11
The moral of the story is, if you cannot disprove the opposite, then there is no certainty. You can’t prove God does or doesn’t exist, or that all swans are white, but you can prove that not all swans are white. That is a certainty. 
There is no other way to prove a fact. Look up falsification.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:56:35
How would it accelerate the current war?
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:09:18
Ahh, and that’s because miners would have to increase the amount of work they do??
And is there an argument for increasing the block size? Cheaper Transactions, right?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:24:05
That’s what I’m trying to figure out.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:57:53
Whoa dude, calm the hell down, I’m just asking a question.
Why is it a scam coin?
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:07:23
You can falsify everything mathematical. You can prove 1+1 =/= 3. All facts cannot be disproved. If it can be disproved, it is not a fact but a theory.
My question is asking for people to prove a death spiral does not exist. If they cannot, then there is a possibility that one does exist.
Please just look up falsification. Your clearly one of the brighter ones on this thread.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:53:46
Sounds like a strong argument based on reason and fact.
Glad you decided not to discuss further.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:11:10
What is the incentive to do this?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:12:34
I think it’s a very valid argument, that’s why i said in the next month, not next month.
I think if BCH doesn’t overtake soon, it will have a tough time in the short term.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:05:28
How fast can an emergency fork be put together? Has it been done before? Who would have to support it for it to be valid?
Do you think S2X backers are forcing this to happen so the base switches to S2X by force?
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:04:16
500 in?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:10:09
Yes I agree, high risk.
This isn’t investing responsibly.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:51:49
Why do miners get higher fees for smaller blocks?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:45:25
So I’m only allowed to think how you’re telling me, and not consider any outside facts?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:53:09
Ah, so more transactions being verified by more people.
In that case, would BTG be any good due to the ability of common folk to verify?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:48:57
Well sure, why not, if it’s being offered?
I’ll take a free lunch.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:40:58
Why do you call me that? I’m asking questions to learn more...
It’s what the other side is saying and I’m just trying to get to the truth....
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:52:47
Ethereum is evolving, bitcoin is not.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:24:58
How has it evolved at all? It has resisted evolution.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:24:23
Keep hodling and you will have nothing left. Bitcoin was hyped up and has no real benefits to it. It never innovates.
