Did anyone think any sitting POTUS would be for the threat to the USDs strength?

We all want bch gone, but it's foolish to believe bch will be below $100 a year from now.

How many pageviews does this person need to make a lot of money? I don't see a bunch of ads on the site. 
I know he's not Satoshi, I'm just trying to figure out the angle.

I totally get the benefits and future benefits, but right now it's a huge liquidation and value problem. Plus the IRS coming for my ass. This bear manipulation is about 6 months longer than I planned for, and there's still no end in near sight.

Great video. Didn't Jamie retract some of his anti crypto rhetoric?
The only part id add is the value of not only freedom from government control, but also freedom from conglomerate control. As we see people banned and exiled from Facebook, YouTube,we see them turn to Bitcoin as they are now being exiled by PayPal and banks. WikiLeaks is a prime example.

What do you mean 5 years? John McAfee assured me it's mathematically impossible for Bitcoin to NOT hit $1,000,000 within the next 12 months. So 100k should hit by mid March latest.
