She was the one who wanted to get married and I jokingly said to her to give me a ring. That’s how I found out, so it was actually kinda cool.

Slate is a terrible, biased, and very untrustworthy site for opinions, masked as news.

You can’t buy a lambo by hodling, thus making this stupid.

Not every girl is material

Please don’t link trash “reporting” sites, regardless of political opinion.

Just so I am clear, you are saying that Trump is not more legitimate when he is the President of the United States versus when he was an entrepreneur?

You bought bitcoin 8 years ago when it was $1000?  Interesting.

He sounds like every other person who made these claims and then was caught using cash for illegal activity. Those guys don’t want bitcoin because there’s a money trail.

Why link it then? You’re giving them traffic, which encourages more of the same.

They only tell one side of the story, of which I consider to be untrustworthy for news.  Not telling the whole story makes it untrustworthy as a source for news. If they call themselves an opinion outlet, I don’t have an issue with them.

My wife thought it was a waste of money and asked to save the money for our house.

Because it’s way better than fiat and hasn’t been crackable by anybody.

Sure, but the kid’s post identifies that he doesn’t get it. By not getting it, he thinks it’s “retarded”. He’s like a child who walks into a movie...

More like compound interest

Go to a currency exchange...
@_date: 2019-11-03 11:44:19
Yet you dont have to show ID to trade any other currency.

Child, you were getting out of diapers when Hodl became a thing. Learn some history before you open your ignorant mouth.

5th Amendment “Takings Clause” doesn’t allow for it to “cancel” like he and the media like to claim. It’d have to be paid, which means taxpayers would foot that bill. This is why neither he nor Warren will win. They’ll never get away from this.

It’s the same crowd. The haters try to shit all over everything and ignore all the good happening around them. They just want to be miserable.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:39:46
Lots of bad info out there, so keep your mind open.

9k. We always get major resistance at key numbers

They never answer, do they? :-)

Vice did a hit piece on bitcoin years ago. It was total shit, using one of their own employees who traded it as a guy addicted to gambling. Absolute nonsense and the last episode I ever watched because of how blatant it was.

American media won’t let him win, so no need to waste our time

He had $2B in free media coverage. Media repeatedly give Yang the least amount of time during debates.
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:42:19
What exactly are you proposing?
@_date: 2019-09-22 09:22:52
Is this really an article?  I can’t even muster the idea of giving it a click.

I don’t speak Canadian, can somebody translate?

Do you think it’s in the best interest of national security for the D. of D. to be transparent about the technology they are purchasing?
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:59:10
How would that change the current model where they buy a $45 screw to help funnel money around?
