Plus there's placed like bitcoinshop.us that already exist where you can buy most of the stuff on Amazon with Bitcoin. Stop supporting big names like Amazon that don't give 2 shits about us and start supporting the small startups who are trying to get Bitcoin into our everyday lives. Don't ask Amazon to accept Bitcoin, they'll get to a point where they'll regret they didn't.

I hope so! People get emotional when they see their money losing value, i see these bitcoin attacks as being psychological, and for the amount of negative news its been getting it really didn't go down as low as one would have imagined.

thank you! we are part of something big. I just feel a little nervous until the bitcoin is actually in my possession (coinbase has a 4 day waiting period) but best believe ill make it known if they screw me over! :)

I keep seeing these posts. Do people not know bitcoinshop.us exists? 140k+ products and accepts bitcoin/Litecoin/dogecoin. We don't have to beg/ask for anything...
