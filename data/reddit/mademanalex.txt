They dont reply to tickets... for up to 5 month.... good you were so lucky, i was too. but then this happened. i used bittrex before and liked it. but if it this happens to you too you will know what i mean... no reply from support for 4 days already. and others i found out have accounts blocked. BTC is the opposite of this. it is against government control. free flow and control of your money. if the block your account, never use them again. and spread the word

I also found this adress :1N52wHoVR79PMDishab2XmRHsbekCdGquK It belongs to bittrex, just 4 to 6 hours ago it had over 40k btc. This adress is where my BTC from bittrex dissapeared to, without me being hacked and wihtout even shwoing up in withdrawal history. I found out that since 10 ddays many people had this issue. their deposits just disappearing after ebing sent to bittrex. ANd no reply from support. The curious thing is, the account had before the dump many 10K BTC on it. now only 200. If this account belongs to bittrex and is something like a cold storage, how is it possible that they have now only 200 but 4 hours ago 40  to 100 thousand ? Are they using those BTC to dump the market? As i said, many peole have right now no control over their BTC, especially Bittrex customers

i didnt lose anything, the BTC problem is with bittrex, they have them in cold storage probably but dont put it in my account.. FUCK bittrex..maing people so frustrated you call something....
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:40:56
ok thank you, I called them and showed them the info on Bitref. then another lady i talked to because the lady named rachel jhonson is an idiot. And the other laday wanted to check, i will call them again soon, see waht they say.

The name of the Scam wallet adress is also Bittrex.com.... ??!
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:40:51
i just did that yesterday, my funds have this problem since 15th. its my first time doing that after they dont respond to my tickets. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:57:55
i tried to work wit them, they received my money since 5 days, they withdrew it to their cold storage probably. But for 2 hours talking and havong the remote desktop , the dumbfucks didnt notice that it was reveived and withdrawn to their cold storage. I found out myself after posting in reddit and people helped me. so pls, either you help or stfu. Why they dont put my money back in the wallet and why they dont notice such a simple thing.  now you understand why i had to post here. because i need to help them after the info i got from reddit. and they are unpolite as fuck. So either they are total dumbfucks or they do it on purpose. Not looking at the BTC account history is very intetional
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:24:18
i used screen cnnect to connect, remote access... shit... now i have to change all my passwords... any other tips? i just enable 2 factor identification.... fuck

Did you check the BTC account history? i tried bitref.com and it shows that the money arrived on 11th and then was sent out on 16th. you can use bitref.com to check. Also the withdrawl from bittrex afetr it got deposited on the 11th , doenst show in my bittrex account history at all. I called them and showed them they will research. But only bittrex has my private key for the bittrex wallet, and even if some hacker would have my account info, i should show up in account history for withdrawals, but it doesnt... So either they got hacked orr they really steal

Why does my BTC get forwarded to this adress and the transactions doesnt even show up in my bittrex account. My deposit shows up in the history to my bittrrex wallet , but my wallet is empty because i checked and it got forwarded to this adress. BTC now lost over 30 % during the time this happened. And i still dont have my BTC back: 1N52wHoVR79PMDishab2XmRHsbekCdGquK
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:35:48
no, the wallet my BTC got forwarded to had 20 or 40 k in balance at one time. It got forwarded to that wallet without even sendiing me a confirmation email or even not showing up in the withdrawal history. And only bittrex themselves can do that. They have our private key and only they can control the system to not show a withdrawal even it has been forwarded to that wallet. I could only find the info by looking up my bittrex wallets transactions on blockchain info explorer. And on blockchain info the transaction shows up, but it doesnt show up in my bittrex account history

Not only Gdax and coinbase, bittrex is also part of that strategy. i have many more people reporting sending BTC to bittrex and they confirm the deposit but then the BTC doesnt show in the wallet. I researched and found out thmey transferred the money to one of their accounts. But for some reason , and i think it is to use the BTC to dump the market, nobody has acces to their BTC, since 10 days. a lot of people like that. Account is not blocked or anything , just BTC missing and going to a bittrex wallet. That wallet had before the dump a few hundred thousand BTC on it. now its just 100. Veery fishy.... adress: 1N52wHoVR79PMDishab2XmRHsbekCdGquK

rachel jhonson (fake name) didnt even know how btc trasactions work. i send her the TX id she didnt know what to do with it, so i showed her. i mean, how can you work for crypto support and have no idea how to use a tx ID or how btc works
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:38:00
why not? you think they will take moeny from one big guy only? if you steal you start with the small ones who dont have so much power. and when you want to end the scam, you get the money from everybody.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:37:46
No , i just enable two factor, after you told me. and i accessed from another pc. i also changed now my password.

Seriously, i am not a bitcoin maximalist at all and i dont like bitcoin... BUT its true, i also see the attacks. The spamming in the mem pool the Bcash pumpers. Bcash makes no sense at all. Bitcoin at least wants to improve. bcash is like a temporary solution which just pushed the problem further back but doesnt solve anything. but it will help Miners to get more rewards. So yea i dont like bitcoin but im not so stupid to not see the attacks

A lot of US users having same issue... so either they got hacked hard or they steal money for exit scam or system is bugged, or they use btc to dump price.
Cuz that account had over 1 million BTC transactions. If its a system bug they would also write it in twitter. As i said there are US residesnts since 10 days having this issue. no reply
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:03:20
i am starting to think this whole crypto BTC thing is a scam. some richer people pushing the price and making advertisement in media and scam the poor people who want to jump onto the boat
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:49
if its customer service... but yeah they are fake, but they couldt steal anything, changed my passwords and enabled 2fa, 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:35:26
yes, for me my account is not blocked. but my funds are just missing. So it is my first exoerience like this and i also wrote in another comment taht a lot of stuff is very fishy right now. BTC dropping and at the same time many people not able to access their btc. after this if i get my coins back i never gonna go on bittrex or other mainstram exchanges again. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:00:18
my wallet is empty, i also checked the wallet history with bitref.com and it also show that the money even arrived on the 11th but was sent out again...! can someone help with more info?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:29:06
i am not the only one having thses issues... now that i research and went online more and more people have the same problem that their deposits are missing. my account is not blocked or anything. and some people have this problem since 10 days. Deposit just missing. and then there are also so many people who have theri account blocked. I found out where my transaction went to this wallet: 1N52wHoVR79PMDishab2XmRHsbekCdGquK
It must be bittrex wallet, because i didnt withdraw anything and even in my withdraw history it shows nothing. My deposit is in the history as completed but my wallet value is 0 because the money got forwarded how i found out to that adress. That adress had 4 hours ago 6 hours ago a few thousand BTC now it has like 170. Since i didnt get hacked it must be bittrex wallet. And my theorie is now that they use the funds to manipulate the BTCprice. They also dont post on twitter that they might have software issues or sth. and you are also sure they didnt get hacked. As you can see i researched and i find very strange things
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:07:56
yes i believe you. but it has nothing to do with my btc not showing in my wallet. 
I only contacted the scam number after this happened. 
my problem is real, the phone number is fake, but they couldnt get any money from me because my wallet in bittrex is empty because bittrex bugged. BTC is in bittrex cold storage but doesnt show in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:43:45
yes it is the correct adress. i also see that it arrived in my bittrex deposit history, but it doesnt show in my wallet. It is in their cold storage wallet but i dont know why it deosnt show inn my account. i think system bug
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:41:54
it was 5 hours ago when it dumped again, now its stabilizing and USDT is also green again
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:57:48
yes, but then a lot of peoples money got stoplen right now from bittrex. i am finding out that many people have theses issues since 10 days. deposits confirmed but nit showing. And there is no withdrawal history in bittrex , so if someone stole it it must be them. otherwise you could see it in withdrawal history which you cant change as a normal user. the account it got transferred to has over 1120000 btc transactions. if it is a hacker , he is fucking rich... i think its bittrexes account. as i said i am finding out that many more people have this issue. so either theygot hacked for 1 million btc or they steal all the funds or its just their cold storage and the system is bugged and doesnt show wallet amount.. After this i wont use exchanges like this anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:21
yes, alot, i also refresh the page 10000000 times a day or more like a minute
