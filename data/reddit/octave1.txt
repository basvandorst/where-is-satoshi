With my limited knowledge of BTC I don't see how they could do anything with it, but then surely they must have thought about it before.

It's down like 15%, this means you probably invested at the beginning of Dec?
You seem quite nervous, just relax. Nobody can predict the future but I would say the chance that it will not go up again with a few weeks or months is pretty small.

Can someone explain what happened here? 
I understand that blockchain.info had an error in their code which made generated addresses "weak". Were they weak in the sense that the keys could be discovered and hence the address and the coins in it could be stolen? How this guy was able to get (steal?) them back?

Nice writeup.
I implemented Coinbase payments on a single product site much like you did, including having the credit card / bitcoin options in tabs. I didn't immediately notice your tabs though.
Do you create your order in your db before sending the user to the payment page? I don't and Coinbase's first callback always fails just because the order isn't created yet (I send a status header 500 for this). I catch the notification on the second callback and so I have to send a separate "confirmation of payment" to customers.
Like you I also had to ask users to complete all fields before being able to show the BTC payment fields.
One other (big) issue I have is that it's impossible to get a stable exchange rate for BTC . I can show the price in BTC but by the time they've reached the checkout page the value that Coinbase shows is different.
I've never used BTC before, I just created an address with 10USD worth of BTC in it and priced my products at 0.10USD in the test environment, which allows me to do 100 test payments. Paying with BTC is obviously must quicker and a nicer experience than with Visa.
I implemented it so I can "announce" that my site accepts BTC in the hope of getting some incoming links, that's all. No idea if I'll ever sell anything for BTC.

Potential data breach on the 5th of August
Our team has noticed suspicious activities on the LiteBit servers on the 5th of August 2017. We regret to inform you that someone without authorization had access to LiteBit data. There has been no intrusion on our wallet servers, all coins owned by clients are safe. The intruder also hasn’t had access to any of the uploaded verification documents (such as your identity card or your passport).
The cause of this breach is known and has already been solved. It is not clear if the intruder has stolen user data. In the worst case scenario the intruder has had access to your email address, hashed password, IBAN, phone number, address and your overview of your portfolio data.
What does this mean for you?
If you have 2-factor authentication enabled it is very important to disable and re-enable the authenticator. If you do not have 2-factor authentication enabled we recommend you to enable it.
It is also important to change your password. We also recommend you to change your password regularly to guarantee the safety of your account.
Are the coins stored on my LiteBit wallet safe?
The coins stored on your LiteBit wallets have not been in danger during this intrusion.
What exactly has been stolen?
It is yet unclear whether or not data has been stolen. There has been unauthorized access to your data. Potential stolen data includes your email address, hashed password, IBAN, phone number, address and LiteBit wallet balances. The intruder had no access to the coins on your LiteBit wallet or your uploaded verification documents such as your passport or identity card.
What can the intruder do with my hashed password?
We store the hashed passwords with a unique extra code which differs from every user. This unique code has been merged with your password. This means that it’s impossible to retrieve your original password.
Do I have to do something to ensure the safety of my LiteBit account?
We recommend our customers to change the password of their LiteBit account regularly. And we especially recommend you to change the password now to ensure the safety of your account. We also recommend you to enable two factor authentication. If you already have two factor authentication enabled we recommend to disable and re-enable it.
Last but not least we recommend our customers to watch out for phishing emails, you can find more information about these emails on our phishing information page.
How do I enable two factor authentication?
To enable two factor authentication you will have to download the Google Authenticator app. You can download this app in the app store or the play store. After this you can follow the steps on “My Account -&gt; settings-&gt; security”
What does LiteBit do to prevent a data breach like this in the future?
We have hired specialists to independently run security audits on our system and website. After which we will obviously implement any recommendations they might have.
May I remove the coins from my LiteBit wallet?
Yes, you may remove your coins from your LiteBit wallet to save them somewhere else. If you would like to know how to store your coins offline safely you can read our guide on. setting up a cold wallet.
Did you report this to the Dutch Data Protection Authority?
Yes, LiteBit has reported this incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority on the 7th of August 2017.
When do you expect to have more information about this incident?
We are still researching the matter, but LiteBit will notify you as soon as we have more information.
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you still have any questions!

The masses may suffer from negative interest rates but big investors sure don't.
Savings accounts for the masses here in EU are indeed ridiculous but you can get pretty safe 3% return investments (maybe even with capital guarantees).
That's still the "safer" option than blindly pumping everything you have in to bitcoin. Personally I'm doing a bit of both and see the BTC as a gamble that could turn sour. Everyone should.

Does she agree with you buying stocks of a single company? That in itself is quite risky. Better to spread it out in a "fund" (not sure if that's the correct term) that contains hundreds of stocks.
We're all in love with BTC for the moment but many things can happen. Don't put your eggs in one basket, don't invest what you can't stand to lose.


Personally, I feel there's about a 25% chance that BTC will implode, 25% chance that it will make early investors amazingly rich and 50% that it will be somewhere in between.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:14:30


Really, what's the use case for that?
I can do SEPA transfers to wherever without paperwork as such, unless perhaps they ask extra questions for those amounts.
Also fairly sure a normal bank wouldn't charge 800USD in fees (what some guy below mentions as being the BTC fees for that amount)

Venezuela's pretty crazy. 
When I was there 5 years ago, before I even left Caracas airport several security guys (uniformed, carrying guns) asked if I wanted to change dollars for bolivars. We did the transaction hiding behind a pillar. 
The black market economy is nuts.
Through friends of friends we bought our tickets from Europe to Caracas from a Venezuelan agency who had a bank account in Germany and sold us the return tickets for like 300EUR at black market rates.
Some shops hid bags of cash in the their trash cans.
And it's gotten so much worse since then.

Do you even need to steal an identity? Couldn't you just buy a fake ID or even better photoshop one at home? I doubt btc-e would have the capability of checking that whatever numbers and expiry dates on those fake IDs would match a real person.
