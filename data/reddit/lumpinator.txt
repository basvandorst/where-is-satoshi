Calm down mate :) I can only say that the guys at moolah are good guys. They accept four different cryptos just to get quicker to the goal. They aren't making a business out of it. Is it some kind of marketing for them, of course it is. Are they doing a good thing at the same time, very much. Are dogecoin, litecoin and vertcoin BS coins? The community thinks different.

Isn't that a bit selfish to think that campaign is about crypto? No offense mate, that is just how it sounds to me. It is about people who do not have a roof above their head. I can't imagine how that is and most certainly don't want to experience it. I'm very sure you think the same way.
And only 4 coins can donate, I wouldn't call that 'inflated'.

Why is there such a massive problem with Bitcoin and P2P? Can somebody explain? I don't understand it. I personally mine a different coin (cause I don't have an ASIC machine and it is the most normal thing there to mine on the P2P network.

Don't feed the troll

Come on Bitcoin community!
Vertcoin and Dogecoin have already raised almost $2500

Not sure but I think they just started to the AUD trade. Saw it today and thought I register. If I would have sold one Bitcoin I would have received $12 more from them compared to coinjar. That's a nice takeaway lunch.

Registered an account today and was surprised how much I would have received more from you guys if I would have sold a Bitcoin. Will give you guys a try next time I trade.

Don't understand why this receives down votes. Aussies should be happy to get more players into the game. Clearly, the guys who posted here are not from Australia and have no idea how Bitcoin trading used to be a massive rip-off.

Good article.
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:01:45
What a pathetic form. You can't even post links. Even the word can't is not possible cause of the ' sign. Anyway, complaint is sent
@_date: 2014-04-30 11:44:30
I didn't vote you down
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:00:25
That wasn't funny troll.
@_date: 2014-04-30 11:23:10
No reason to freak out mate! :) It's not about different coins here, it's about charity. That's all

Regarding adoption and P2P network drop like a rock. Have you read about V2P? People will be able to just start one installation, create a config file with the config file creator and with a click of a button they have their own P2P node. A closed beta has already been released.
The big difference is that Bitcoin needs to overcome a huge hurdle regarding P2P adoption. For Vertcoin P2P is quite normal and a huge part of the community supports and recommends it strongly. No other coin has that and it looks like it isn't very easy to achieve. Almost all coins wish to have such a high P2P participation.

One of the founders. rick

Still, the highest P2P part of all crypto. I think that's a pretty good achievement. The development of V2P will make it easier for newbies to have their own P2P node.
Nobody said it is a killer-feature. It is just a feature. Does it cost anything to mine those coins? No. Is it some (very) little extra income, yes. Btw, the main reason for merged-mining was never extra income or so. It was always meant to be a testbed (in case of Monocle, we can't control what anyone else does)
Stealth addresses, Bitcoin should get it **eventually**. Vertcoin will get it by the end of this month.

Mate, if you really need the money, follow it up. But I wouldn't risk my stable blood pressure for $15.
@_date: 2016-02-14 05:19:19
That's quite some time. Mine wasn't that much. Lower 4 digit AUD for me. In case you want more specific information about their company, their ACN is 600 161 233.
You could write Rick an email that you're going to report him. You can do that online. Give him a deadline of 2 weeks or so.

Delayed AUD payment for me (took over 2 weeks). But received it at the end. Don't know if it was a help that I threatened Rick Day with a report to police and to ASIC.
@_date: 2016-02-16 00:53:01
Rather not. It's not a big story anyway. Didn't take months to get my money. Just a few emails to put some pressure on those bastards. But good on you for taking action. Have a look on their Facebook site. Plenty of angry peps on there.
