Trade crypto for memes, create a solid meme portfolio, watch it grow and then cash out.

No, because it's origin can be traced back. It takes significant effort to obfuscate bitcoins source. The simplest way would probably be exchange into another cryptocurrency and then back.

Let's see the wallet addresses that had the funds.

might be $60m right now, lets talk in a year how much that's worth.

It obviously involves a Gooey written in visual basic

Thanks for the chuckle. At first I was waiting for the massive underground asic farm to reveal itself. But no. It was not.

I don't know about that mate. Compared to Fiat currency, it seems far more difficult to use. 
Maybe once a bitcoin debit card comes along that allows you to use btc like you use regular money, even though I don't see why one would prefer this over Fiat currency.

I bought a few games on steam with bitcoin, it's pretty good. 
Then I tried to refund a transaction, and they credited my PayPal account with Fiat currency. Meh. 
Still, I'd like to see other software distribution platforms follow suit.

My point is that compared with Fiat currency, it's more difficult to use and find places that you can pay in bitcoin with.

Can someone share the links and files so I can get busy analyzing? I love to take apart malware.

Electrum - private keys - sweep
Enter the private key there.

That's not a blockchain.info security issue. Log off your damn wallet when you're done using it, and this would have helped. 
Idk. My blockchain.info session expires after 10 minutes of inactivity.

Bitpay accepts the bitcoin and credits valve with Fiat currency. So valve never touches any bitcoin themselves. 
@_date: 2016-05-07 07:45:17
is this way

Wow take it easy there. 
If you access any torrent website you better know how to protect yourself. That goes without saying. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:10:50
This can be so easily solved. 
The guy needs to PGP sign a message that says "yep, it's really me" with "satoshis" private key that matches his widely known public key. 
But no, that would be way too easy. Y'all can stop paying attention to this clown until he does so.

Absolutely savage

You forgot to ground your tinfoil hat, it's going absolutely crazy. Try rarbg.com for a torrent site that is good for recent and popular releases.

Here in the northern parts of Canada you got maybe a gas station and  a grocery store with a pharmacy, and a hardware store within a 50 mile radius. 
Where are you going to go with your bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:52:33
I do. I'm saying more places accept USD and CAD than BTC. Therefore Fiat currency is the easier option. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 00:44:18
No, but their payment processor does.
