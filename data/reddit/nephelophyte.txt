People seem to think they control development of Bitcoin. If youre invested in btc you should investigate that. I'm not so I don't personally care.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:20:23
I never know where and how these people are doing cheap transactions. There's always one guy
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:25:15
I'd tip you if the fees weren't too high ;)
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:55:22
Look at who invests in blockstream sir.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:19:32
If this community wasn't so quick with the ban hammer I would talk to you about a world of fast and cheap beyond these walls. 22$ is ridiculous and anything over 5 minutes is an eternity.

Is mentioning an altcoin a bannable offence?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:20:46
XRB is my pony
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:28:02
Do they have an earlier poll that would indicate a trend?
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:24:17
Stop banning the people who contribute to meaningful technical discussions then? Lol
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:23:46
Nano is down like 97%
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:07:34
Fully agree.

Actually a credit union, Caisse Populaire. They did so after a transaction was deemed suspicious I think. I finally sorted everything out but it just goes to show you how important having control of your money is.
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:02:59
Could be painful to hear for some.
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:58:59
I don't get this one
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:01:45
I was poking fun at the last one lol

I like Chiang Mai but opinions vary wildly over that place. Do your research.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:41:23
Exactly. Bitcoin derives value from its utility. It still has that but its use cases are being limited in its present state.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:47:07
I admire your outlook. A lot of emotional debates happen on this sub with redditors not realizing they want the exact same thing. I love the fact that it's unseizable if you know what you're doing.
There was a certain disappointment I've personally had when I've seen agile altcoins fulfill a lot of the use cases that I thought Bitcoin would have filled. That disappointment waned when I realized this was the very 'put your money where you mouth is' kind of democracy that I think digital assets should have. Seeing how politicized the crypto space is getting means that we're having an impact. That's a beautiful thing in certain ways.

Can confirm. Total of almost 2 years out here. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:04:03
Ya'll gon learn today
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:49:24
Is there at least a message warning about the difference between bitcoin cash and bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:03:04
There was a bit of controversy at some point though, I believe, which is probably where your opinion shifted. Going open source doesn't mean that they're not selling data,p though. But open source is good enough for me.
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:45:21
Where did you get this info from? Didn't they just go open source?
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:22:13
so did I
@_date: 2019-05-19 12:51:29
Low tx fees would make it a lot more feasible
@_date: 2016-07-21 11:44:59
I'm in the dark over Ethereum, was this article made to parody this?
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:18:32
Doesn't that fall under the category of "tuition" in the picture?
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:36:12
On a more serious note please don't do this guys. Haven't we learned anything?
