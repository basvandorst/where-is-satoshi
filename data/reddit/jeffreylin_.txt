Don't forget to back up your private keys first!
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:28:24
100 bits
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:02:28
Haha, that's okay, I'll keep going for the rest of the thirty days and see if I improve. If I see that I do, I might go again!

Ripple is actually not as decentralized as you think. All of its nodes are controlled by the creators. If you look at [computingforgood.com]( it says that 


which means that they were not mined, but rather created. So what prevents them from creating more? In addition, it can't be mined, and is not anonymous.
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:37:43
I apparently don't understand the concept of bits
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:27:47
Thanks. I do have ~100 ripples though. What should I do with them?
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:38:43
9000 bits  
I'll join the party too
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:34:01
No, you need to get rid of those keys. They not only have access to your wallet, they have access to the private keys that they can sweep money from. So you should sever all connections with them altogether.
@_date: 2014-08-15 07:52:03


Did nobody else catch that?
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:07:21
You don't need both Electrum *and* Armory, just one would do. I feel like Armory is more secure, but is also more advanced and sometimes has a lot of technical jargon that's confusing. For more bitcoins, check out faucets at  It will take some time to get some Bitcoins to play with though.
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:47:37
If you do reddit will automagically convert it for you.
@_date: 2014-05-07 23:09:53
Actually, it seems like I wasn't paid at all. Could this be because I paid two days after this announcement was made?
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:14:32
In that case, to delete the private key you will need to go to the Receive tab and then click the more option next to the key. Click the archive button, and then go to the archive tab. Don't delete the address if you want to keep track of how many Bitcoins you have.
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:31:14
It's probably because some are only in it for the money.
@_date: 2014-09-28 14:02:22
Don't we all?
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:15:30
You can ask in this sub, or at bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:59:31
It seems that the payout from day two is less than 2.5 mBTC?
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:10:32
I'm actually not sure why I like Armory better. It's not like I need a lot of protection for the ~0.05 BTC anyway. UI is pretty nice, but everyone has their own choice. The only problem I have is with online wallets, because people phish you for the credentials. But any client you downloaded from the Internet should be secure enough.
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:59:00
You import the private key, you are spending from that private key.
When you delete the key, you are deleting it from the wallet, but you can still import it in the future. All deleting does is make sure that you can't spend from that address again without reentering the private key.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:03:25

Signed up
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:14:09
Ah, yes, forgot about that. I use Armory and sign transactions that way, keeping my cold storage as cold as possible :)
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:30:58

@_date: 2014-11-02 21:09:02
Check out 
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:41:21
Ah, ok. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:53:34
Sweeping means to push them all from this address to a new one.
When you import the key, the key is put into your wallet. You can spend as much as you want, and then delete the key to have the remaining in cold storage.
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:03:37
What are you using? Blockchain.info, Bitcoin-qt, Armory, etc.
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:08:50

@_date: 2014-11-02 21:00:00
So 0.009 BTC?
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:09:11
I've noticed that Armory has fixed my mistake for me when inputting private keys once or twice though. Granted, it didn't give me the right wallet afterwards, but still.
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:24:34
Didn't work?

Seems a tad bit suspicious. Sounds like the kind of thing that would try to steal your passcode. Not that I don't trust you, but some may say that this seems dodgy.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:35:45
I'll take half minus one!
@_date: 2013-10-06 19:28:43
Well, I'm not a developer either, and I'm not really sure how this could be solved. I'm just saying that these could be the concerns of some people. And Google Play doesn't review its apps as much as Apple does theirs, so the permissions may be misleading.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:12:53
I use Blockchain.info, but Coinbase seems good too. Of course, paper wallets are best.
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:32:27
They drain quite a bit of battery though.
@_date: 2013-10-06 19:44:22
Yes, QKOS services is the maintainer of Blockchain. This can be verified when you go on Blockchain.info. The encryption says "QKOS Services" or something similar.
You did not buy the Bitcoins from Blockchain themselves. They simply linked you to a place where you can do so, and that site put it into your Blockchain.info wallet. Therefore, Blockchain.info cannot do anything about that, unless the Bitcoins are in your wallet already, in which case you can sell them.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

@_date: 2013-10-25 00:59:49
Well, you should have read and understood the implications of gambling your only money. What odds did you gamble at? Has it come back yet?

[Zeta Mining](
A quick google search yields nothing else.
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:29:50
First of all, turn off automatic email backups. Then enable a second password. Turn on 2 Factor Auth and disallow logging in from a Tor IP. If you have a static IP and use this computer on at this place, restrict the wallet to that IP too. Then change the PBKDF2 iterations to 20000 to make brute forcing that much harder.
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:59:37
Couldn't this be abused by continuously creating accounts and sending the money back and forth?

Put the link at the bottom of the post and broke it. Also told about the risks of going there.

No, they just generally do it for the heck of it.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:04:46
Same age at you, but my problem was just [making my teacher believe in it]( Perhaps some stuff people have said in there can help you help your teacher understand what Bitcoin is and why you shouldn't have gotten a zero.

I just want to hash at a rate that is more than 13khash/sec.
I can also offer you a portion of the earnings.
I wonder if it will run okay without proper cooling though. If not, don't send it to me.

Thanks to you and everyone else who has given me any amount of Bitcoin on this thread. It is very kind of you people to do that, and I would repay you if I could.

I'm currently looking into creating a faucet (mainly to learn how to code, not to give away :P), but have not found the [free] hosting I want. It will be hard for me to learn this way. Hopefully this will be done in the summer of 2014, after I take the SHSAT and the regents and whatnot.

It seems that he sent them to his account, then did a series of complicated things to throw people off. Strangely enough, he didn't mix them. It was eventually sent to a central account with that has ~180 BTC in it. Or at least that is what it seems like.
@_date: 2013-10-23 23:53:04
I have done so immediately after reading your comment. Thanks for the advice.

@_date: 2013-12-08 16:34:03
As a Bitcoin user since ~August 24, I have had about six Bitcoins enter and exit my wallet. I believe the best way to support Bitcoin is to spend them. Not convert them to money, but to use them for services.
Unfortunately, you and I are still both young and don't really have a need for money. But we live in a world where money is everything. So, there's that.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:21:02
Exactly. The next big thing may be Bitcoin itself. Buy some before it hits the thousands (and then the moon!)
@_date: 2013-09-24 00:29:37
This has been fixed. Some say that it was a problem with CloudFlare.
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:46:16
Buying and selling are not options, sorry. :(
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:59:04
I live in the United States, so I'm not sure if this is something that pertains to your country. In the US, we buy it from markets and they send it to the BTC address. I would not know which one you bought it from.

As far as I know, QKOS doesn't charge for anything. Do they?
@_date: 2013-10-29 02:34:26
Plus, this is a brain wallet. This is put into the section in Import/Export in Blockchain.info and then the private key is generated.
@_date: 2013-10-09 22:47:58
Well, I use cgminer, but they are pretty much the same.
What you want to do is press [P] for Pools. Then hit [F] for fallover only enabled. Use [A] to add a pool, input URL, worker username and password.
If you pump out enough shares, Slush's would be good for you. I like Deepbit because it allows you to be paid per share.

@_date: 2013-11-24 19:30:59
You should give it all to me.
Or just keep it and watch the price go up.

It's when you 'mine' for addresses. Ever notice how someone had an address starting with '1Jakub' or '1Trains'?

I usually keep my identifier in my Google Keep, actually. Couple it with Google Auth and it's pretty hard to beat.

Like said, you should start using it now. Anything you earn is pure profit, and if you don't want to keep them to yourself, you could always donate them to or tip worthy people with them.

Well, what are you brute-forcing? The wallets?
And if it's declared illegal, people in other countries will continue to use it, and probably the people in the US as well, but illegally.

Nope, that is Blockchain's messing around, and you should have read the satoshidice website notes before you did that.

No, he means the gambling provider address. Are you sure you read up on Bitcoins before entering this game? It should be in the transactions tab.
Also, your bet came back as it was because at 91%, you won't gain a lot. I recommend always using 48% or lower.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:07:04
Why not buy some? Although I suppose the price is a bit high right now..
