The point is that IsSuperMajority and BIP9 are a _trigger mechanism_ for the users (nodes) of the system. The design inherently does create a natural veto (whether politically motivated or even just out of apathy) but that does not make it a vote - that's just a feature of ISM/BIP9, not a feature of soft forks. Nodes could just enforce the new rules anyway at a given block height but requires a much longer deployment time to be orderly. If the majority of the hashrate is ready it's much easier and quicker for participating nodes to activate the new rules - otherwise you need to wait for a large portion of the economy to get upgraded and ready before activating.
I think we had a honeymoon period since no-one really chose to use a soft fork deployment as a wedge before. Ironically, if mining was super decentralized, we'd have the same issue since you'd never get 95% upgrading, there is always apathy. Still today there are a significant portion of computers running OSs that are 10 years out of date as an example.

If the miner is filtering their network from invalid blocks, they know the transactions in the block are not invalid. By default, those txs are nonstandard so they would never see them, they are only susceptible to a miner deliberately going out of their way to include such a transaction.

They absolutely don't. As an experiment, try mining a block &gt;1MB or a block with &gt;allowed sigops, or include a transaction that pay someone else money to them, or mines &gt;12.5BTC...
Miners can extend the chain with anything they like, but if they want it to be accepted by the economy (and in fact to even propagate the network), they have to mine blocks that are valid to the economy. Otherwise, they wont get paid and they'll get isolated from the network.
@_date: 2017-02-03 05:11:54

@_date: 2017-02-19 21:03:00
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:57:58
You appear a bit confused. Miners have the ability to extend the blockchain with valid blocks. The economy decides what is and isnt valid tho. If miners for example create  a block that is 1.00000023MB in size, the entire economy will just ignore it. 
95% miner activation is just trigger to coordinate upgrade. It certainly isnt necessary for a soft fork, but it is the safest way.
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:02:40
70 to 80%
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:55:34
This is a great source of confusion. Miners have the power to extend the chain with valid blocks. They don't have the power to decide the validity of those blocks. the moment a miner creates an invalid block, or builds on an invalid block, his work will not only be rejected, he will be banned from the network.
There's some weird pseudo game theory going around that suggests miners could bully everyone into switching the rules and the economy would follow them - but the assumption of bitcoin is that miners remain honest because it is the economically rational thing to do. Playing games trying for force the entire economy to switch rules is will certainly result in them losing far too much money to make it worth even attempting.
Miners provide a service to the economy, and they get paid very well for it. The incentives are well aligned.
@_date: 2017-02-16 19:27:14
Two types of soft fork. A censorship soft fork does not require any node participation. The other kind requires nodes to activate the new rules. Miners have always had the right to select transactions to be mined, so they can individually mine or refuse to mine certain kinds of transactions. That's got nothing to do with soft fork activation.
The situation you describe is when &gt;51% of miners have not upgraded and not taken steps to filter invalid blocks. A malicious miner can create an invalid block and cause a hard fork. The incentives dont really work for that case. At the minimum, the economic incentive is to participate in a safe manner on the network. If a soft fork like segwit is ongoing activated by nodes and not miner majority then the right course of action is to filter invalid blocks. That means using a border node, or upgrading the node. If the miner doesnt want to actually mine segwit then they can just not mine segwit, but they can do so safely. Of course, the incentive is to mine segwit because collecting the most fee paying transactions is the economically rational thing to do - and if you don't, someone else will. Additionally, so long as the major organs of the economy have upgraded there miners will not want to mine invalid blocks or risk being forked onto an invalid chain. So again, the incentive is to upgrade/use border node to at least co-exist safely on the network.
I'd contend that a flag day soft fork with enough lead time for the economy to upgrade will be quite safe enough. The situation right now with &gt;60% of nodes upgraded to 0.13.1 or .2, which includes the exchanges and wallet providers means that miners would be shooting themselves in the foot to leave themselves at risk of a malicious fork. If they dont want to mine segwit they can always not mine the txs - leaving others who wish to mine them, to do so. I would also contend it takes focus away from miners who dont want to be put in a political position and this stay neutral (by not signalling). Must easier to quietly mine transactions after activation than have the whole economy pressing F5 on the segwit statistic page. every few minute focusing on who is and isnt signalling :-p

So basically since miners would be attacking Bitcoin, it would performed a PoW change to defend itself. A soft hard fork cannot kill the chain without consent. a soft hard fork is a method of making a non-contentious hard fork safer... but is has to be non-contentious to succeed. Bitcoin3 is assured in this scenario.

If there is a threshold it's not user activated. It is user activated when miners cannot veto activation.


Depends on what you mean by hostile. If it means attacking, this is nothing new for a flag day fork vs hashrate fork. Miners can be hostile to both. For hashrate they can be hostile as they currently are, or by triggering the fork with the intention of splitting the network.
If hostile means "dont like it, wont include the new transactions", that's nothing new either, miners always had the choice of what to include in a block. Some will, some wont. The world will keep turning, and almost certainly if the feature is used more, more and more hashrate would be incentivized to mine the transactions for fees.

But you dont know the hashrate. You assume the hashrate is being honest and only signalling for what they are able to validate. BIP66 showed a completely different reality. About 50% of the hashrate was false signalling. that triggered activation and then someone accidentally mined an invalid block causing the network to fork.

Yes, UASF requires much greater coordination and has risks, but hashpower triggered activation is also risky due to validationless miners who false signal (and it already causes a forking incident during BIP66).
The risk for WU attacking a UASF is if the economic majority upgrade and protect themselves, he'll lose a ton of money and look bad in the process. The protocol provides plenty of protections for those following consensus, even against a majority of malicious miners producing _invalid_ chains.
Jihan has taken great efforts to hide his activities (by investing in and providing hashrate to "independent" BU pools), while Antpool remains "neutral". I seriously doubt he'd engage in a public attack on the blockchain itself.

I've seen this misinformation repeated a lot recently...  basically claiming that it took a year to create segwit but just took zander "two months" to create FT.   But if you look at   you can see that almost all of segwit was done in nov/dec 2015 and that same time included a conference and Christmas break.  The extra time was all testing and fine tuning, work which FT has not had and is never likely to have.
Work started November 7th, it was proposed to be something seriously done on Dec 7th.  By Dec 30th it was completely functional and had a running test network, up through march people did additional testing and refining the proposal.  The spec and implementation were completely done in march and it was deployed to the main testnet. Then followed several months of additional testing on the final design, and validation of the spec by other implementations.  Then it shipped in 0.13.0 deactivated, since SF are not activated in new major versions, per release policy... And 0.13.1 had the activation. 
The bitcoin core implementation work in dec 2015 was done by a single person, no more was required. Only the review and testing had a large number of contributors.  The segwit work also includes compatibility and handling all the upgrade corner cases, more things that FT does not do and likely would never do.

This is a call to action to fight this attempt at gaining a total monopoly on the mining machine manufacturer. We need public references to serial dcdc power layout designs prior to this patent application. ASICMINER and Bitfury since their 55nm use serial dcdc design, as well as most others that I am aware of.
Since serial dcdc is basically the most efficient layout for mining boards, a patent on this would be devastating to any competition as Bitmain could either prevent others using it or demand a license fee for every machine ever made. This would be devastating and TRANSCENDS pow-change.

It is a somewhat apologetic answer: in a decentralized system it takes time for nodes to arrive at the same state of consensus because it takes time for blocks to propagate on a gossip network however, because all nodes follow the same rules, the syncronization is algorithmic. In terms of orphan races, well it's possible for separate miners to solve the same block and it will be a race for which block is seem by which miners first and which block they build on top of. So at the tip, there can be some minor discrepancy sometimes - but this is a slightly different issue. Both blocks are valid. All nodes follow the same rules.
In the case of BU, it's possible a block is created which some nodes do not accept as valid due to size, but BU nodes wont reject those, they will hold onto them. If miners build on top of that for long enough (usually 4-6 blocks, your node according to it's settings will accept that chain. At worst case, your node will cave into the chain after a day or so). So in a world of pure BU, they believe, eventually all nodes will converge. Assuming everyone "gives in" after 6 blocks, then you can be sure of confirmations after an additional 6 blocks. The problem is in a BU world, everyone is allowed to set their "give in" setting to something different so you can really be sure about the state at a give height until a day has passed and the so called "sticky gate" has expired (since miners can continue mining whatever size of blocks they like and your node will eventually accept it after a day).
Even a world where 100% of nodes used BU's rules, BU nodes would basically not be consistent with each other - we just dont see that right now, because in order to play on the network, BU miners are not violating the 1MB limit. Additionally, miners in a BU world have no visibility into what nodes actually accept immediately (without being forced over time) - worse, and more importantly, they dont know what _other_ miners accept so in a BU world, miners attempting to raise the blocksize would be shooting in the dark - if nodes or miners disagreed with them, they risk losing their reward for solving the block.
So the point here is, by exchanging algorithmic consensus for this user controlled shooting in the dark you compromise the reliability and guarantees of the Bitcoin system, rendering it pretty unreliable at best, useless and broken at worst.
The BU "algo" is essentially broken, and this post doesnt cover the myriad of ways in which BU nodes can also become inconsistent with themselves.
I hope this helps.

They are working on safe deployment, not a 2mb HF. There is almost no chance a fixed blocksize would pass muster, it would need to be something future proof IMO.
@_date: 2016-11-17 11:52:18
No, not true.
 Miners cant decide either. In the case of a hard fork, if miners fork, they produce invalid blocks, rejected by the network. In the case of a soft fork, it is with passive consent of fullnodes who can reject the miner sf with a hard fork.

I would like to say thank you, you are basically the first moderator of r/btc to show some sympathy regarding this issue. Roger has only whitelisted a few users if they kick up a big fuss over the issue. The automated reddit rate limiting is meant for spammers. If a user is not spamming, there they should not be throttled just because other users have worked a way to silence others they disagree with.

@_date: 2016-11-17 06:08:14
It's pretty interesting reading answers from an eco-chamber.  They surround themselves only with people who share their views, exclude the wider technical community from their debates, then claim they have "wide support" for their opinions. (much like Roger's "statement" efforts being concocted in private, and fortunately leaked recently).
I think the CEO of ViaBTC has demonstrated yet again how he doesnt understand the basic workings of the Bitcoin protocol, and seems to think miners are able to defacto decide on protocol changes for the entire Bitcoin system.
In the interests of keeping informed I encourage everyone to read his answers and make up your own mind.

It's pretty clear the fund was setup to try and displace Bitcoin Core. There is no transparency or accountability for how, what and who gets funded. Considering the bulk of the money comes from Roger Ver, who has been openly hostile to Bitcoin Core, there's simply no way he's going to spend his money on Bitcoin Core projects. The devs arent daft.
I refer you to the [first leak]( which was toned down severely after the leak because sunlight is such a good disinfectant.

user enforced soft forks would be a logical progression.
btw, miners not activating is not a sign of no consensus - all the pools in total are run by just a dozen people, and most of the hashrate under 6 pools. That is in no way representative of user consensus either way.
@_date: 2016-12-14 08:56:18

You seem to understand C++, so I find it difficult strange you are arguing segwit is not a blocksize increase.
A block, is a block of transactions, arranged in a merkle tree, secured by a PoW hash. All that data is called a **block**. How those transactions are stored on disk, or transmitted on the network is irrelevant. Before segwit the maximum size of a block was 1MB, post segwit activation it is 4MB.
Core have avoided the need for a hard fork by not counting signatures towards the old 1MB check. It's a simple workaround that makes it backwards compatible.
@_date: 2016-12-24 16:04:59

The decentralization is an illusion. Firstly, around 70% of the mining hardware comes from one company. Secondly, that same company actually has three pool so their pool share looks non-scary, thirdly more than 60% of the hashrate has conglomerated acting as one pool, with the appearance of being separate pools.

The fact he is lying about his orphan rates, or in one of his AMA questions calls Bitfury stupid because they _actually validate_ blocks before they build on top of them...
Haipo Yang is a fraud, bolstered and funded by Wu Jihan who fancies himself as the modern day Machiavelli (he's playing several sides off of each other).
Haipo Yang's "relay network" is nothing more than a sophisticated sybil attack, based on the theory if you connect to every node you will get information faster, which actually harms the network. He's not open sourced his "invention" either, because he couldnt handle the peer review that would lambaste him for engaging in antisocial behaviour on the p2p network.

Some of the largest transaction producers and wallets in the Bitcoin ecosystem have committed to adopting segwit very shortly after activation. Much of that work is done, just waiting for Jihan to stop playing proxy wars with ViaBTC.
I think it's safe to assume a decent chunk of txs will be updated to segwit type very quickly.

True, just like Joinmarket.
@_date: 2016-11-17 07:47:48
Roger's claim is that because Core developers continue to use r/bitcoin, which he thinks is censored, that Core developers are endorsing censorship. Core developers and supporter use most social media platforms, Twitter, Slack, Wechat, Telegram, Reddit (including multiple subreddits). Whereever there is conversation about Bitcoin, you can find people of all "faiths" as it were.
The fact can only harp on about censorship, and what a great economist, computer nerd and rich businessman he is, is a testament to the fact he has pretty much nothing to offer. People of real worth do not boast about themselves or their achievements in order to bolster their opinions. They just churn out success after success. You know, a bit like Bitcoin Core developers do for example.
Roger is funding divisiveness and encouraging all sorts of antisocial behaviour which causes material harm to everyone, including himself (not that he minds because he is very very rich and can afford it).

Safety refers to "when it is safe for rules to be enforced because enough of the hash rate are validating the new rules". With soft forks, all miners have to sing the same tune or they risk producing competing chains which would orphan. At high thresholds this is not only unlikely, but would generally only harm a very small % of the unupgraded hashrate.


So unfortunately there isn't a way for users to show their preferences in a reliable way. For example, not all nodes are equal, and some nodes could represent hundreds of thousands or millions of users. There are a lot of problems in how you actually measure consensus because of this, and that's partly why we have a problem today. Some have suggested coin voting, but this also suffers problems like privacy issues, or issues with custodial services. It also cannot work unless more or less every coin votes, but also we dont know which coins are unspendable (because of lost private keys).
This is why planned hard fork changes are extremely difficult to pull off unless there is an emergency situation.
Soft forks are optional for users and so long as they are not harmful to users interests, users will tolerate them. If miners introduced a soft fork which say, censored coins, then the scenario migrates into attack mode - as miners can be viewed as attacking the network. This is where things like the nuclear option may come into play and actually have a chance of success.
Since soft forks are optional, those that don't like it can simply opt out and it would take most of the users objecting to force miners to either stop, or face the consequences.
So the answer is not simple, and that is how the Bitcoin system is, I think by design. If it was easy to change the rules by hard forks then Bitcoin would not retain it's properties of censorship resistance etc.
How to actually get consensus for hard fork changes is still very much an open question. From what I gather, bug fixes that do not alter the fundamentals of Bitcoin could probably be deployed with a far out flag day since such upgrades are not contentious. Anything political or likely to change the incentives of the Bitcoin system is always going to be problematic and polling consensus is always going to be difficult - since a safe hard fork is one that does not put people's money at risk, and for that to happen, the entire economy has to upgrade.

The agreement was concluded with Peter Todd's post after the California meetup. 
Just for clarification though, the agreement was originally to produce a proposal to Core within 3 months. Core have always taken at least 6 to 9 months to review consensus changes and no one can determine or agree the outcome in advance and that is without the added difficulty that Core states they cannot decide HF changes.
@_date: 2016-10-23 16:21:57

In a nutshell, adjusting blocksize alone changes the dynamics and incentives of the system. Bigger blocks have a larger validation cost, bandwidth requirement and propagation delay. In order to increase the block size, these problems have to be addressed first. Segwit is an effective blocksize increase and some of the mitigation to allow that is Compact Blocks, BIP152. I also believe Bitcoin FIBRE (bitcoinfibre.org) also helps block relay between miners, although it's a centralized solution pending more work on a decentralized fix.
@_date: 2016-10-24 17:46:06
I agree, a consensus hard fork should be completely undramatic and even an SHF could be a useful way to do it as suggested by some Bitcoin Core developers in fact.


I quite understand this point of view if you listen to the anti-segwit lobby. The actual difference between the hard fork and soft fork version of segwit is so tiny it's uninteresting. As a soft fork, the commitment to the witnesses is in the coinbase, as a hard fork, it would have it's own dedicated field in the blockheader. The difference is the level of disruption required to the ecosystem in order to pull off a hard fork in that circumstance.
I would like to offer the suggestion, if we eventually have a hard fork, let's have a useful hard fork and make it worth the disruption, and let's do it for something that cannot be done as a soft fork. A blocksize HF is quite uninteresting and fixes nothing. For a hard fork to be truly uncontroversial and safe, I also suggest it needs a long deployment time with a flag day, maybe 2 years lead time. This is why a segwit soft fork deployment is faster.

r\btc was billing the event as a "massive on-chain scaling event" and other hyperbole.

Miners can decide what blocks to mine on top of, and can reject any block they like. So as a group, 51% of the hash rate can decide the chain **so long as the chain is valid to the full nodes**. In short, a majority of hash power can decide the chain with the consent of the full nodes on the network.
Miners generate tokens and collect fees, so they have to work on a chain that is accepted by the economy, else their tokens are worthless. That is the incentive that keeps miners honest and working for the economy. Full nodes are not obligated to follow the miners and if miners work against the system they will get fired. 
If miners are in charge, it wouldnt be possible to hard fork against miners wishes, but clearly it is possible.

Miners only job is to decide transaction order and construct blocks, for which they are paid very well. If some miners block segwit against the will of the users and economy, the users can demand a proof of work change. The rational response from the rest of the mining community will be to put pressure on ViaBTC. Ultimately if ViaBTC do not play ball their blocks will be orphaned by the miners. That will quickly lead to either compliance or extinction of their business as their customers flee.
 Ultimately if miners as a whole work against the wishes of the users and betterment of the network, they will lose their jobs in a PoW change.
I remain unconvinced ViaBTC will even be able to maintain face if they try to block not only a scaling solution but also a major feature upgrade to the network. They will look pretty stupid imo.
Pretty much all the major transaction producers are chomping at the bit in anticipation of segwit, make no mistake, the block segwit brigade hasnt got a leg to stand on.
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:10:38
As I understand it there is still a big question of how to actually assess consensus for a hard fork. There have been two clear attempts so far that have been clearly rejected by the community. Also how do you really judge when people want a hard fork (except in an emergency situation where the alternative is system failure making it obvious). People want Bitcoin to scale but there is to my mind no clear consensus about hard forking a blocksize increase, nor even which methodology would be best.
Quite to the contrary, it seems the wait has produced a number of interesting research avenues, like how to perform HF upgrades safely taking into consideration many participants do not fully validate blocks.
and have done a lot of work in this regards. The latest blog post from Todd is a good read 
@_date: 2016-10-31 10:40:58
This post misses a key point. Sure, the difficulty adjustment of ETH vs BTC is different, so the lower hash chain ETH could adjust automatically. For bitcoin the side unwilling to fork would consider this an attack on the network and hard fork the difficulty (and maybe even the PoW) so they could continue the chain.
The TLDR is you cannot force unwilling participants to comply, even if you cause disruption, they will fork away from the hostilities to preserve the original chain.

@_date: 2016-10-23 15:06:51


It's quite simple. Most of these companies do not want to become embroiled in crossfire. Mentioning anything results in getting attacked and having many conspiracy theories thrown at them. Some recent example, Meltem from DCG and now DCG itself are being ferociously attacked by r\btc. Electrum voiced support and now they are screaming at Electrum. There are dozens more examples. It's just easier to keep quiet, let the FUDsters do their thing and wait patiently for the rollout of segwit.
I think it's wrong for companies to remain quiet and let Core take all the heat, but unfortunately it is what it is. Their voice will be the adoption of segwit, and they will certainly complaints if Ver and ViaBTC try to block segwit.

Activation is entirely independent of hashrate.
Edit: fixed typo word.

Nano S has more secure hardware and no on computer input of secrets, so by definition it is objectively more secure. However, Trezor, with the latest updates uses obfuscation that makes even entering passphrase on computer basically safe. It isnt more secure tho, but is is secure enough that is doesnt matter.

BIP149. It has 8 months to stand until.it can be deployed, plenty of time for review, then 8 months from then until timout, plenty of time for everyone to upgrade (based on the speed the first segwit deployment got 70% in 5 months, and now given the huge demand for segwit given the delays).

I think there is near 100% support for bigger blocks, even among the so called Blockstream Core. The difference is between how, and under what conditions you make blocks bigger. For example, segwit gives bigger blocks, without a hard fork and even then, segwit was delayed until certain mitigation strategies were delpoyed (Compact Blocks and Bitcoin FIBRE), in order to offset some change in dynamics (not to mention all the stuff that has come before that leading to making a moderate bump safer on the overall system).
Where there is contention, is over hard forks - when, what conditions and how to determine consensus. I for one do not understand the logic of the hard-fork-at-all-costs camp. Scaling bitcoin is about meeting certain requirements as opposed to dogmatically hard forking. The whole urgency from the "must HF now because the sky will fall by 2016" narrative started in early 2015 has been proven to be incorrect. So there is time to do segwit, get adoption (from large transaction producers) and in the meantime lay even more foundations to make on-chain scaling safe and effective. I think the technical community would much prefer a one time dynamic flexcap type proposal than risking a HF just for a size bump which doesnt bring any other benefits.
This is why segwit is such a no-brainer, because it gives an effective blocksize increase, solves problems, makes scripting upgradable and all without the disruption and risks of a hard fork.

To be clear, his writeup was about BIP148 not UASF in general which is generalized by BIP8.
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:57:47
I prefer data over gut feelings and we have plenty data on upgrade times for nodes from release to release, as well as how widely anticipated segwit is.
@_date: 2016-10-16 10:18:48
Status quo is a choice. Not voting is a choice. I think the matter was settled long long ago.

or not...

The agreement was concluded with Peter Todd's post after the California meetup. 
Just for clarification though, the agreement was originally to produce a proposal to Core within 3 months. Core have always taken at least 6 to 9 months to review consensus changes and no one can determine or agree the outcome in advance and that is without the added difficulty that Core states they cannot decide HF changes.
@_date: 2017-05-03 12:59:26
BIP148 is a UASF that forces miners to signal for segwit, which would then cause the exist deployment to get 95%, actually 100%. Non complying miners would get orphaned.
BIP149 is a simple redeployment that activates in July. 2018.
@_date: 2016-10-27 07:40:39
LOL what is this? 
BIP and code, what is your problem. Peter Todd blogged about this recently and Luke posted to the ML in February... no one cares enough to even notice.
If the technical community wont even discuss it, where is this overwhelming support for a hard fork you speak of?
@_date: 2017-05-03 12:54:08
No, it does not activate on Nov 16, it activates on July 2018 or sooner if miners choose.
@_date: 2016-10-23 12:35:44
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:04:31
BIP8 is the fix for the 6% attack.

Miners follow the economy, not the other way round.
@_date: 2016-10-24 13:28:42
But they have 90% of the economy. Node count doesn't matter. You could easily make Core nodes 5% by launching 100k nodes on AWS - it's the economy, exchanges, users, wallets etc that matters.
@_date: 2017-05-03 12:57:22
Hashpower isn't actually important, what is important is that the economy has enough time to upgrade so they are able to enforce the rules. Miners follow the economy, not the other way round.
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:57:34
based on what? we got 70% upgraded in 6 months.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:11:06
BIP8 fixes the miner veto in BIP9. Miners can still signal like BIP9, but at the timeout, the state transition to lockedin if it isn't active.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:06:02
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:06:55
They cant stop because there are too many miners and nodes both enforcing the orphaning rule.
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:53:16
It is how it was meant to be, but devs didnt account for deliberate misinterpretation and exploitation of the mechanism.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:55:41
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:48:07
You are mistaken. The segwit period started on block 477792, it can only be 100%
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:47:33
They have stopped signalling, and more than 65% would need to stop enforcement... but then Aug 1 is coming when BIP148 enforces. So there is no way they can reneg.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:28:57
use  instead @_date: 2017-07-17 21:38:17
BIP91 is a miner activated version of BIP148 that allows miners to ensure they are compatible and guarantee there wont be a split. It also allows them to save face. But make no mistake about it, BIP91 activates the same orphaning rule as BIP148. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:45:50
That's wrong. Due to the BIP91/148 rules being enforced, there will be 100% signalling.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:00:10
Trazor does not have more security than Ledger Nano S, it is the other way around.
@_date: 2017-05-03 12:56:03
The starttime is Nov 16. You dont need to discuss the starttime it is the timeout that matters.
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:45:18
BIP91 is incompatible with BIP148. To be compatible, it must activate on Aug 1 if not active already.
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:50:48
There is no such thing as a UAHF. It's just a flagday hard fork
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:22:13
Give the decision to add ads, what's to say they wont secretly sell analytics companies your xpubs or queried addresses so they can link transactions? No one would ever have to know.   
A premium version would be worse because they would know who you are, since purchase can only be made through the Google Play.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:52:51
It will fail. It will be ignored. Miners follow the money, they can't dictate the system rules.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:02:12
They plan to release on July 21, so it will be impossible​ to be compatible. BIP9 needs 5 weeks approx once everyone has upgraded
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:15:25
All good, but it would help if segwit was being used more on LTC. where is LN after all the fanfare?
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:22:07
No, because I understand the incentives. They will not break consensus, period.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:34:32
Users decide, not exchanges or miners. Users chose Core by their own choice. Bookmark this and come back in 3 months.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:22:51
pretty sure just about everyone signalling NYA is actually running Core
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:17:59
it is - revenue protection. same with apple store.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:51:31
There is no chance at all see the wiki. A HF cannot be decided by 80% hash rate, or a handful of businesses. a
All users must upgrade. 3 months is utterly impossible for that to occur in. It is also not possible to code and test the code enough in. I can say with absolute certainty, Core with neither merge BIP91, nor Segwit2x HF.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:10:17
No, it isn't compatible even with this change. It can only be compatible if it enforces in Aug 1 if not already, regardless of signalling. splitprotection is much more compatible.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:01:28
You are overestimating what "agreed to" means. They will not break consensus with the network. You watch and see. This is just not how HF can be planned.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:50:54
That would be the chain with most work for sure ;)
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:28:10
point 3,  just ignore it and run Core.  Guaranteed Core will not release 2x and guaranteed, exchanges will not run non Core nodes. Guaranteed miner will not enforce 2x unless exchanges and users do.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:04:04
except, what if BIP91 fails, then the 148ers would have lost their chance... so they wont trust miners to follow through with BIP91. It is impossible yo even reach locked in by Aug 1.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:02:03
No, they won't break consensus. Bookmark this.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:24:32
No, there isn't signalling in BU, it is just active and coinbase text is consensus critical.... so not actually running BU makes no sense
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:20:20
BIP91 is not compatible with BIP148 unless it activates before Aug 1.
