If they worth $10 it would be the same, you’ll only have more bitcoins than you actually do.
The problem is that people uses it to speculate and get more FIAT instead of using the actual Bitcoin that already has the FIAT value *mindblown*
So yeah, I would stay on Bitcoin. Actually I thing all I invested I will stay in Bitcoin and use it for anything I can, while it’s in my wallet their value it’s going to grown and I will have to do nothing.
Using FIAT right now (to get a salary in Bitcoin, for example) it’s only a reference since the new money has to get to a stable value to know how much it will worth.
Still I have doubts about how much coins are lost and we’ll never get back and so on, but still I think it’s going to change the world economy.

This is stupid, the value was $10 or wathever.
No one paid the amount the title says for a pizza, the value of the Bitcoin just raised.
So someone just paid the right value at the moment, nothing more, nothing less.
The point of bitcoin it’s ducking using it, so stop with this speculative shit and nonsense comments.

FIAT farm does

Well if it’s going to $10 it’s because something else rather than speculation (security related, for example).
But yeah, right now you cannot buy groceries but this will star with us accepting it in our commerces, by selling/buying second hand items, donating some money to someone, splitting the check from the restaurante and eventually paying everything with it.
The usage it’s also a chain, so just “holding” is not going to help to anyone.

Stop using that mindset because it’s going to kill Bitcoin if we only use it for speculation

Noé that is going up, let’s talk when it goes down again.
This is not just about gambling/investment in bitcoin. You should know that anytime it can go so fucking down that it might take a while to recover, if you think you can survive that moment and keep paying your debs until that happens... then think about three more times and do whatever you want.

It’s ok, you just spent $15 on something, 1BTC is still 1BTC

Yeah that's weird.
Right now is going down but selling that amount of BTC right now smells fishy, like they know is going to crash a lot.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:32:37
Yeah if you are selling right now, where the price is going down like crazy, or you are afraid of the bitcoin going to $1 or you bought it half priced and want to stay "safe" before panic to wait what the future will departure.
And someone with 20BTC doesn't look like someone that will panic.

One problem added to that is that the Bitcoin doesn’t have value itself related to the market.
I don’t know if I pay 0.00001BTC for one cup of coffee will me too much or not, because there is no market outside to compare.
That leads I won’t purchase anything with bitcoin, because I don’t like to waste money overpaying for stuff.
But yeah, you will say that I can figure out the BTC price comparing with USD for example, but that won’t work seeing how much BTC fluctuates.
