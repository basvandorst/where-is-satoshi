Fees are so high ti's not even funny. It defeats purpose of the whole technology. We need to see some changes.

Wow! This is a prime example of what actually might hinder bitcoin's adoption, frustrated people like you taking it out on newcomers or people who are simply seeking clarification.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:48:34
Does anyone actually still have faith in BTC? Just wondering because I'm faltering.

How do you identify a shitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:07:50
Yes. It might buy you less but it's still not a dollar lol
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:35:31
1 dollar is still 1 dollar...

Yes, great point. The only thing wrong with cryptos are fucking forks. FUCK THAT. Completely loses the credibility o the space by just inventing a new Bitcoin, and having to call it the real bitcoin.
