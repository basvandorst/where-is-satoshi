I will expand on these proofs:
The dollar can, and in fact must, be used for IRS tax obligations. This makes it day and night with bitcoin, which is not accepted for taxes.
Gold can be used as a real metal. Bitcoin is not a physical object.
A piece of toilet tissue can be taken across the border with more Convenience than a ton of gold, but Convenience is not the same thing as value.
That is why the Convenience aspects of cryptos are meaningless without value.

You will be singing a different tune at $4,000 this Monday.

Yeah but Nasdaq companies at least had something going on, whereas bitcoin is a load of nothing.
So I wouldn't call it a bubble, bubble signifies "value but inflated." Cryptos have no value.

A commodity usually has some use. Gold can be used for golden sinks etc. Since bitcoin is good for nothing, I wouldn't call it commodity.
The thing I call it is Nigerian scam. You are asked to fork over money for a promise.

We already have electronic money, my mom receives her salary on the phone.
If there are further advances in electronics, fine. Bitcoin is still going to zero.

Very good bargain, you spend the price of a car for something that doesn't exist.

Who told you it would go to a million. The truth is it will go to 0 dollars.

What gives stocks value is the dividend.
Since Bitcoin dividend is zero, then the value of bitcoin is zero.

1. Bitcoin is not like the dollar
2. Bitcoin is not like gold
3. Convenience and Value are two different things.
If you comprehend these three points, you will see that bitcoin is worth literally nothing.

They are hoping there will be a dividend in the future, so they buy now.
But with Bitcoin, a dividend will never happen, because it has no earnings.
So now you understand why all cryptos are going to zero.

The arrival of Bitcoin to its fair value which is zero.

They may not, if the Justice Department starts investigating btc owners. In that case the price would really go negative. ("Take them off me, I'll pay you.")

It's just downwards from now.

Even zero cents is overpaying for bitcoin.

Not really, because a security gets you ownership in a company.
Cryptos get you nothing, which is why they are going to zero.
