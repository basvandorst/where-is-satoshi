One of the reasons the taproot app  script and Schnoor signatures were combined in one proposal is because taproot masquerades every transaction as  possibly being a script or possibly being a simple pay to public key and you can't tell what it is  and in many cases you can execute the script as a paints a public key

We can't repeat that mistake in Bitcoin so by getting Segwit in and the Script Versioning we can now do Schnoor Signatures, Tap Roots and Graft Roots and introduce fundamental privacy technologies right in the base layer.

Keep in mind **Bitcoin could run today with one tenth of the mining power and be very very secure without any problems** how do I know well we had one tenth of the mining power year and a half ago it was very very secure then so nothing really happens when the block subsidy runs out nothing really happens when the halving happens nothing happens if bunch of miners turn off their equipment other than a slight delay in block issuance which then gets adjusted in less than two weeks by the next difficulty retargeting.

So why is privacy and financial affairs so important? The reason is that if you understand that money is the language by which society not only coordinates but also expresses value and where cash is the last remaining mechanism before crypto currencies that allows people to coordinate an express value to each other without anyone else in the transaction without intermediaries then it becomes obvious that if you lose the ability to have privacy on those issues it undermines many of the other fundamental freedoms.

00:13 ...one thing that's been a significant cause of the recent market downturn and that's liquidations when an account with a large exposure to Bitcoin for instance an account that had bought a hundred million dollars of Bitcoin on **10x Leverage** and then watched markets go down 5%.  When that account is in danger of going bankrupt all the assets need to be sold off before it actually does go under. The Closer that account was to bankruptcy at the beginning of this process the board more desperately you need to sell off its assets.  In crypto, often deep liquidation don't even start until the account is only 1% away from going under which means that all of the assets need to be sold off almost immediately this can have really large impact in fact enough that it often drives the price of Bitcoin down enough that even more accounts are in danger of going bankrupt and need to get liquidated this can cause a sort of chain reaction where each series of liquidations moves markets down enough that another set of accounts needs to get liquidated **this domino effect can in turn drive the market down as much as 30 percent in a single day** causing this **cascading set of liquidity failures like what happened with banks in the 2008 financial crash**

Simply because the word "Bitcoin" is not present?
1. The Internet
2. Decentralized Internet
3. Decentralization in General
4. Regulation
5. Censorship
I 'd never presume to know what other Fintech constructs Elaine Ou had in mind when she wrote this article...and I surely don't know her personally. But I can see from her bio on the Bloomberg article that she's a Blockchain Engineer at  Global Financial Access  ( Nick Szabo, CEO ).  Connecting the dots between her background and those ideas as related to the internet vs. the BTC space felt pretty natural to me.
Don't know what your background is in the BTC space (mostly just constructive interest for me). So maybe you have the nads to tell her directly that  "... the thrust of the Bloomberg article is mostly false..." and then ask her if the above stuff is "relevant to Bitcoin" also.  But I'm guessing you wouldn't value her opinion anyway due to your "mostly false" idea.
Didn't think "relevancy" of the above central themes to BTC could be such a stretch for anyone, so I posted it. Still don't.  But as the newb here...does it matter? What's next?

The purpose of a decentralized internet, and decentralization in general, is to constrain the power of a single entity to regulate. As Internet pioneer John Gilmore once put it, “The Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”

The size of Blockstream’s mining facilities cannot be overstated.  According to Blockstream CSO Samson Mow, the facilities would account  for roughly 6 exahashes of Bitcoin mining power if used at full capacity  with the latest ASIC mining hardware.  
In addition to their mining centers, Blockstream will soon launch the  first mining pool with a focus on putting more power back into the hands  of individual miners via the BetterHash protocol.
