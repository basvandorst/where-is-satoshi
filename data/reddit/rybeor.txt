"non-equity, bulletin board, otc, pink sheet, and other specific securities are not eligible for the price type you have specified"

what does it mean when you say "blocks are getting full," does a limited block limit the amount of transactions?

sorry - dumb question, how does btc affect gbtc exactly?
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:08:56
interesting.  it doesn't seem as though I am able to buy any shares through the application I use, any idea why?
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:10:54
how does that differ than mining?  are there any advantages of running a full node other than maintaining or supporting the community?  
Lastly, does it increase transaction speed ? / if we have a surplus of nodes, what benefits and issues would that create?
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:51:21
can someone please ELI5
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:53:22
Got it, when did this change occur?  In the last year?
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:26:28
how does the embedded key benefit the blockchain?  what value does it add?
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:36:19
Got it, so I wouldn't need an exchange, correct?  Exchanges are really a 3rd party that handles transactions that the average person does not want to do.
So just to reiterate, a full node gives me control of everything without the need of utilizing an exchange, if I am understanding correctly.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:11:14
Can someone ELI5?
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:51:44
So if I understand this correctly, the decision comes from whether you want to trust a 3rd party in using their node or having your own which is essentially ensuring your privacy, security, while enhancing the end-user's experience with certain types of transactions?
So if I am using coinbase, am I trusting their node?  And I am assuming by using a node, I do not need an exchange like coinbase?  I'm self sufficient in buying, spending and storing my own btc?
Apologies in advance if I am asking dumb questions, and thank you for your answers and patience.
@_date: 2015-06-08 18:52:26
Thank you sir

To start off, I'm not a BTC expert (maybe compared to the average person).
If you are trying to do B2B sales, then my only concern would be security, although that concern may just be my ignorance. 
I think it is definitely worth working. Who knows what it could turn into.

@_date: 2017-02-18 03:04:34
this is my hunch but i feel like if you are on coinbase / gemeni and have been for awhile, its better to follow the rules and file your taxes because we all know the IRS will be after these companies first when each bitcoin is worth more than 10k. does anyone agree with that statement?
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:26:09
what is the advantage of bigger blocks, anyone?
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:38:12

i am so sick of seeing these stupid "it's happening" posts it makes me want to vomit. please stop.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:02:09
Hey what did you decide on this?  I found that $277 was the cost basis number from bitcoin.tax blog, but let me know if you've figured it out.
@_date: 2017-02-19 18:13:10
so living in the US using coinbase is really the only option to get bitcoin if you want the easiest method.  the barriers to entry for bitsquare.io or even gemeni are too much to most. 
with that being said, if one does use coinbase or has been, itd be wise to file your taxes so when coins each over 10k, you won't be a target by the IRS.
happy to hear thoughts on this as well should anyone have something to contribute
@_date: 2017-02-01 19:46:52

probably bitcoin if you know how to buy and send to hot or cold storage. i bet some people will be investing in both, less techy people will just do etf, but id do bitcoin and just not touch it for 10 years.
also keep in mind even though there is alot of excitement around the ETF, who knows if it will get approved
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:25:22
nope not a pp issue, took a little more than 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:28:08
many of those people are paid trolls
@_date: 2017-02-18 03:09:42
right thats my point. so imo those people should file their taxes. every year.
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:02:24
ditto. almost, but nope.

@_date: 2016-06-29 20:46:30
this was my thought process as well. but it could be tomorrow or it could be a few years right? hasnt an etf been in the making for a long time? and does this document make you think its coming sooner than later or is this document just politics?
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:45:27
hey hey, i like this theory.  i wouldnt rely on it, but it makes sense. china has more people, especially super rich folk.  ive been keeping an eye on gbtc and noticed that the mornings on open  usually have the highest per share and it slowly diminishes through the day (roughly).
in any case, i support your theory. and per your theory, on close today and as of right now the price of btc is 689. im expectinf gbtc to have a nice little jump tomorrow morning given china isnt awake yet to drive it up further
all speculation of course :) I know nothing.
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:58:41
Ongoing backups as in anytime a transaction occurs? Buy sell or transfer?
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:26:44
Interesting thoughts.  My only other observation is that gbtc is more sensitive to btc increasing than btc decreasing.  Ive watched a few times as btc climbs $1-3, gbtc will increase from 1-10. We know there is a premium attached to it, but the reason for being more sensitive when btc climbs and not falls is my question
My speculation is people/funds are anticipating btc going higher and buy gbtc when it lowers in anticipation of their bullishness. Also, something to note is the volume, extremely low! 
I think gbtc going to the moon will be a good indicator of the overall bear/bull for whoever seems to be trading it imho.
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:28:26

honestly that was my issue as well. two dogs is pretty cool. there's another one near by, i think its the pink cow or something. but thats why i was surprised about this japan bitcoin hype. I couldn't find many places as a foreigner 
a cool note-- when i hopped in two dogs, there were a few dudes who were working on a bitcoin cloud mining startup. so its also a good place to meet fellow btc-ers imo and chat about bitcoin!

what about the part that says people not being able to access the exchange from their phone to sell bitcoin? or people feeling that the gov't might have stopped them from selling? they were unable to access the website to sell, is what my friend tells me it says.

@_date: 2016-06-18 01:27:29
I posted something earlier today entitled btc/gbtc price divergence. I watched today as btc decreased as gbtc increased. From what others have told me, they follow each other loosely.  However, i think the most recent uptick in gbtc stems from hedge guys or older folk who are using gbtc exactly how it was intended -- buyig at a premium so they do not have to deal with exchanges, wallets etc due to the learning curve.  I think the general consensus is that bitcoin will continue to go up therefore, i think investors are actually putting more money into gbtc when btc goes down (effectively keeping the gbtc price stable) or as i saw today, an increase in the gbtc price.
This is all speculation. I know nothing :D
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:58:04
So ordinarily, once in cold storage, everyone always backs it up? Did not knoe that was a best practice thanks

@_date: 2017-01-19 15:54:56
correct me if im wrong. so the bitcoin holders and users (early adopters) will be the early adopters of abra correct? for instance for long term holders who are never going to sell everything, this is the way to inject bitcoin into a use case? it all starts with the holders? and are those people the tellers?

If britain leaves the eu gold and btc will go up. Then prob a sell off, then everyone will realize they shouldnt have sold, then up more.  The interest rate stuff and other country specific events from japan, swiss, us, and britain coming out in thr next week or so is worthy of mentioning, from what i hear thru friends
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:46:26
juat got back from japan. id say the avg person knows more than the avg westerner, however, most japanese dont understand it still imho. i did go to a brewery that accepted bitcoin though, that was cool. overall, they are ahead of the US but adoption is not as much as it seems after reading these articles, me thinks

whats corexit? can you please eli5?
@_date: 2016-12-04 03:52:11
yo ok fine bitcoin "soars" from this. but my question is how? other than people slowly learning and investing in coin over time, anything siezed isnt going to be invested in btc. my point being how does any citizen buy btc with gold or fiat before it becomes outlawed or seized
i feel like everyone is expecting a huge jump from this but if that happens it will happen over the course of years, and by that point in timr btc will be a lot per 1 or a little or dunzo anyway
@_date: 2016-12-22 11:43:13
Given that the Chinese government first took notice of bitcoin in 2013, I'm assuming that they realize that bitcoin can be bought in China and then sold abroad. They realize that this goes against their control of capital in China. And knowing that it goes against their control of capital, they have refrained from banning bitcoin. I can only assume that they decided that not banning bitcoin was worth the trade-off. They've decided that having the bitcoin mining and trading industries centered in China is worth more to them than the very limited amount of money that flows out of China via bitcoin. 
And this makes sense. Bitcoin is small. It's literally not big enough to disrupt Chinese monetary policy on a scale that matters. In the future, bitcoin might grow large enough to disrupt Chinese monetary policy (if bitcoin becomes big enough to accommodate huge outflows). But if bitcoin grows 100x bigger and can actually threaten Chinese monetary policy, then the bitcoin mining and trading industries will also grow at least 100x bigger. If bitcoins are worth $50,000 or $100,00 each and Chinese miners mine 60% of the bitcoin, then you're trading cheap Chinese energy (some of which was going to go to waste anyway) for major inflows of hard currency. It seems that the Chinese leadership likes the idea of trading plastic bullshit and cheap energy from within China for hard currency, oil, gold, and overseas assets from outside of China. Bitcoin seems like a great way to facilitate this. 
Another thing: If the Chinese government plans to make the Chinese currency globally traded and globally held as a reserve currency in bank accounts all over the world, then they are going to have to give up the sort of control (micromanaging exchange rates) that bitcoin would threaten anyway.

great read but had a question relating to adoption and the power of credit.
in a democratic society, building credit is very important in order to takr our that loan for a house or carm some would also call this a part of the american dream. good credit? no problem, heres money to afford your down payment for that house, or feel free to rent this new apt bc we trust you.
how does this translate to bitcoin? you cant build credit to take out a loan. and the economy is really built on that ability.

can anyone think of a parallel scaling example in the real world or in history that is similar to our little block size debate?
@_date: 2016-11-20 18:31:12
can someone explain to me how 1 bitcoin is worth more of less dependent on country? is it the exchange in the country that facilitates this? do they make the premium ?

If demand remains stable or increases then price eill go up. If demand decreases then price will remain the same [8-10k) or go down

I'm super confused guys.  WHO is transacting in bitcoin?  I don't think people in the US are.  And what are they transacting?  What are they buying/selling/spending?

how do they know they are the same coins?
@_date: 2016-12-10 05:21:21
hmm interesting. thanks for your insight

I loled
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:49:00
well in any case, thank you. To be honest, I have always been a lurker. Every now and then, I see an article where I feel compelled to write a response after reading multiple top-rated responses that I disagree with. if you have any additional thoughts on it, I'd certainly be interested to read as well

Wow, thank you.  this was a great explanation.  I've been in this sub for a while now and started following btc in 2013 and I'm continually amazed and thankful that anytime I need a clear explanation, it is provided concisely and understandably.  Thanks again!
@_date: 2015-07-14 02:42:17
haha... hm.
@_date: 2015-07-12 03:44:05
is this transactions occurring within a certain time frame? can someone explain this to me, not really sure what hash rates are
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:12:06
you in US? you'd still have to pay cap gains on any event

I like her a lot. This was a fantastic snippet.  Looking forward to each and every development!
@_date: 2016-10-15 04:24:58
cool. so i don't really have the time to read the entire transcripts but from what I'm reading from the convention or whatever, there will be a hard fork in place which will contain two different scaling strategies , lightening network and block increase i guess?
are there any other laymen's terms you can provide kind stranger?
@_date: 2016-10-15 18:58:36
what a twat. whats his motive?

Saw the twins in a random deli last night. they were what it seemed like their gym clothes. said good luck and looking forward to their etf. whichever twin that said "thanks" did not sound optimistic, but im hoping for some good news
@_date: 2016-10-28 01:06:53
haha. dude I really want to learn what the hell everyone is talking about all the time. I still read literally everything.
@_date: 2016-10-11 21:55:48
haha they seemed like decent dudes imho? only chatted in passing though
@_date: 2016-10-15 04:41:08
good to know. do you think the winky etf will come out before or after the hard fork
@_date: 2016-07-07 02:31:30
is this an SAT analogy?
@_date: 2016-07-01 05:10:43
not much significance imo
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:12:36
great example, thank you. do you have any knowledge on pros cons of increasing hash rate, which camps are supporting what, and other things to consider? im trying to get caught up on the technicals and current obstacles for scaling
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:02:26
gets repeated on what? stocks? this is bitcoin, the most volatile thing you can purchase. dollar cost averaging on 3x inverse etns? thats a bad idea. for bitcoin?
 i would argue that it is better to buy small consistent amounts over time than buying all at once at X price considering it does whatever it wants.
also, I'm going off of "success" stories and recommendations from people specifically on bitcoin.  i didnt even click your article yet but i would assume it was written before 2012
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:34:14
whats an example of unsafw use besides losing your backup, or leaving it out in public? legit question, no funny business here

i wouldnt keep any btc on an exchange. id disperse my coin in various wallets as soon as they are recieved?

@_date: 2016-07-06 16:14:37
thank you. I did not know the revenues go to the other miners should some drop out.  good to know. there are tons of moving parts im still trying to wrap my head around
@_date: 2016-07-05 11:58:30
thank you maaku :)
@_date: 2016-07-06 11:54:37
thank you for your responses!  Very informative :D
Totally understand the unchartered waters territory.  The only reason why I can think of a miner continuing to mine is if they kept bitcoins over the years.  If they exchanged straight to fiat, why would it make sense to continue mining? my .02.
This is under the assumption that all miners care about is making money, which I believe is the reason why they started mining in the first place.  Thanks again!
@_date: 2016-07-06 18:57:13
wow. this needs upvotes. take an upvote!

cool thank you!
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:50:40
yeah article says no mention of btc but may i ask the implications / speculation on why this was posted?
@_date: 2016-07-01 05:09:04
pretty much the law regarding bitcoin in china, how the government does not consider it as an item of value ( ie government recognized currency) how ever it is ok with its citizens using it. not sure how old that video is though
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:06:47
i use three wallet apps. is that safe? 
@_date: 2016-07-06 02:28:50
some questions 
1.  if 2/3 of the miners flat out quit, what happens?
2. if all miners quit what happens
3. if more miners are added what happens
if i am a miner with an ongoing cost associated with maintenance and i deem it not worth the investment to continue the operations because the ROI sucks, why would I continue mining?
i feel like these miners are a business so what is the incentive to continue mining?  I guess they'd have to believe that it will be a lot more valuable in the future? and because they have tons of coins? but even so, why make that risk if theyve made a ton anyway?

very interesting. this could take 1-3 years though, is my guess. i will have to do more research on it
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:36:16
so you have no eth currently?
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:59:56
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:24:47
i think it will go up. then down. then up. and stabilize higher than where we currently stand.
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:17:22
honestly, take my advice with a grain of salt but id buy X amount once a week (maybe on wednesdays to offset volit.?) forever. whether that be btc or fiat worth. spreading out over the long haul is what ive read to be the best strategy if you are a hodler. short term bets  =gambling. my .02

Can anyone confirm that this translation is accurate? I feel like everyone is quick to analyze without even getting a few look overs by anyone who speaks English and Mandarin fluently.

And how would that work exactly? I wish that was realistic 
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:00:42
Hi - I have been very involved in the music scene and worked nearly every aspect, including having a music technology startup ( a successful failure in my mind!)  For me, the concern would be the obvious fluctuations in price.  I do not want to spend money on a concert when 2 days later, the price could shoot up 20-30 bucks for whatever reason.
then again, if you have an entrepreneurial spirit, there could be a way around it. as an avid live concert go-er, i can definitely see btc as potential if it were to eliminate transaction fee's associated with tickets bought. it'd also be cool if there were still transaction fee's, but those fee's could be used to amount to getting free tickets to future concerts. or if there was just a season pass for concert tickets, like there is for ski resorts. 5 venues, 1 pass, incorporate BTC.
so many possibilities!

in what country or countries do you speak of? it is currently 100% legal to buy etherum in quite a few big cities in the US. what arrests are you referring to? I dont have etherum. bitcoin for awhile now, but i have watched it for a few years.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:43:27
So if I have Chase as a bank, and utilize in selling small volumes of BTC, what are the chances I could get flagged? 
volume - under 10 BTC
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:39:55
sounds like the workings of a political mastermind... (putin?) I think Russia is ensuring etherum's growth and survival by supporting it financially and creating more whales to push the price up.
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:32:43
hypothetically, it would depend on the price i guess, but im having trouble giving an answer to your example tbh
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:27:18
exactly the same feeling. except that I was researching non-stop about a month ago and never went through buying.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:48:38
man - woke up randomly here in NYC to check BTC for the fun of it, and boy did I get a surprise!
