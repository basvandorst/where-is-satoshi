Yeah well, during every rally this sub is suggesting to buy buy buy. Then the price goes down and there will be post after post from new people who already lost a lot of money and ask us how this could've happened. After all this was an amazing buying oppertunity??
And then the usual reply is "well you shouldn't have bought at the top you silly". 
Maybe it's better to stop with these pump posts. If bitcoin is what most people here think it is it should be fine without trying to pump the price.

C'mon! Don't be ridiculous.

Take a guess.

So like maybe 50 people in Argentina use a bitcoin debit card?
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:41:57
People here don't sell. It's not about profit. It's about changing the world and the system. It's about helping the unbanked. It's about helping countries like Venezuela. 
Nobody here cares about the price. 1 btc=1 btc. 
Take your greed elsewhere.

The word bits is way older than bitcoin. Its usage is also way broader than bitcoin. Just because a small part of bitcoin is called bits doesn't mean the rest of the world can't use that word anymore. That would be ridiculous.

I don't get all the outrage. What exactly is the problem with that article?
@_date: 2016-07-04 11:01:11
If bitcoin drops 25% overnight where are you gonna put your money then?
I can't believe i'm being downvoted for asking a totally normal and relevant question. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:11:41
But still you thought someone would tell you how to get free mney?
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:06:47
So you only want posts that will claim the price will go up??
Anything else is not allowed. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:27:14
Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:18:17
No one is gonna read that.

You have no idea if bitcoin will be worth anything in 5 years from now. Your retirement plan is completely ridiculous and one of the most unsafe investments i can think of. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 07:12:19
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:59:27
This is completely stupid. First of all you listened to someone for what to do with your investment. Big mistake and you're to blame. You and no one else. 
And then you sum up all these gains on other coins. There was no way you would've been able to catch them all. In fact you didn't. 
You have no idea what you are doing and you would've lost your money anyway. With darkcoin, eth or bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:52:50
Haha wtf?? No it's not?
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:43:14
I don't understand that graph. All i see is some dates. What happened at those dates? And what is your question exactly?

Looks legit. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:27:09
So how many countries did we go through already? I can't keep up anymore. 
Venezuela is not hot anymore?
What is the point of all these posts? They should switch to bitcoin or something?
@_date: 2016-07-04 02:49:32
Because you are clueless about investing. People like you always lose their money. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:57:32
To me this is the most likely outcome. 
A pump now and after the event a panic dump. 
There is no reason really for the price to stay this high. Nothing suddenly fundamentally changed the last month. 
But good thing people are in it to change the world and not just to take some quick profit. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:46:04
No, not really. Bitcoin is tiny. Absolutely tiny. Most people don't know what it is nor do they care. The story of how it was created isn't really exciting either. The movie would only appeal to a small group of bitcoin enthiusasts. 
A nice documentary? Sure. A blockbuster? No way. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:54:30
Ready for what?
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:59:23
While letting the government control your retirement might not be super safe it's still way, way safer than putting it in bitcoin. As anyone above the age of 7 would understand. 
But yeah you're free to do with your money what you want. You somehow act as i want to take it away from you or something. You are very agressive and angry. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:29:53
Even if he makes money that way how does it matter?
Also you should know better than clicking sponsored links.

Yes. People buying.

That site made my browser collapse. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:21:57
From my past experience i noticed that most people who tell others to buy are not themselves buying. But of course i could be wrong in this case. 
But to me this seems just like a useless pump post. 
Also buying during a rally is never a good advice. A few days ago was a good time to buy. Not now. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:10:22
1 btc=1 btc. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:57:07
The most profitable? Uhm let me think. None?

It's sooo easy to win at primedice that you have to spam Reddit to make pennies. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:42:21
So you want others to buy while you sit on your coins trying to get rich? Correct?
Why don't you take out a massive loan and buy some yourself if this is such a great advice? Why should others buy at 700 dollars??
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:25:53
Contact them. What are we supposed to do?
@_date: 2016-07-04 08:21:38
Never mix family and bitcoin. 
Especially during a pump, in which we are now. Imagine if they buy now and next week it drops to 400. Let's see how "hooked" they are then. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:55:06
Ok. Fair enough. Yet that doesn't mean a price rise is quaranteed (other than a pump and dump based on speculation) so my comment still stands. There is no real reason why bitcoin should be 100's of dollars higher than a month ago. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 21:00:02
At one point you either buy or sell coins. That's where your info is connected to the blockchain. But obviously your info is not public. So in general there is nothing to worry about unless someone really is after you and has the power to get your info from an exchange for instance.
