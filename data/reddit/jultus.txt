To those trying to explain the monetary system to me; I know it's 'similar', I have known for ages, the reason I posted this is not to glorify FIAT currency, it's to wake people up about it never getting to be useful to 'generate' currency using 'crypto-mining'. It's a waste of time and energy you should use for something else. Go grow your own crops. Go make your water potable. Go desalinate salt water. Stop multiplying.
Again: I'll gladly see you post in 2023 about how wonderful your crypto-mining has been for our survival. Good luck!

You do realize Sathoshi is a fake name, right? I was putting a reference in to Ryuichi Sakamoto, which inspired Satoshi Nakamoto no doubt. Me and some others who were at HAR2009 actually think we know who Satoshi really is, but we're never gonna tell, because he's one of us.

I've made more than anyone here, most likely. I mined mine in 2009 using a laptop in a tent at HAR2009. That's the whole point; It's **morally completely despicable** to assume being rich just because you were 'early' with some crypto experiment and thought *"hey, that's funny, I can generate stuff just by running software and do nothing productive whatsoever, just waste electricity, how cool of me!"*
Go explain that core system to your offspring, tell her why he/she gets such expensive presents every year just because your dad was 'early adopting'. For crying out loud. The fact alone that most of you think that's in any way 'decent' is disgusting!

Exactly. Proving my point.
@_date: 2019-12-02 11:56:54
Go tell that to the users of cryptopia, or any of the other 'exchanges' that were allegedly 'hacked'. What a joke.

Just because you have zero counter arguments does not make what I wrote a troll post.

Well, that's exactly the problem: Rowling and Martin are hoping the money holds its value, it will not. They have money that isn't real anymore, which is why most banks now charge you for storing your money with them. Negative interest. Nobody expected that would be a thing. It's now real everywhere.
Bitcoin is not going to save us from that problem. They're all trying to make you believe that it is, but I don't see it happening at all. None of the ideals that were behind Satoshi's creation are what bitcoin has become, and please convince me of the opposite, because I don't see it anywhere. It's all bitcoin to make money that doesn't exist, it's an immoral deceptive mountain of lies on top of lies, in order to subscribe to the massive denial that is required to keep the poor poor and make the rich (seem) wealthier. Only to find that you can't eat money.

Well I honestly don't remember, it's been more than 10 years. It was really fast, maybe even more than 1 BTC every 4 hours, depending on your CPU of course. I have proof, as in the wallets that I tried to recover, for example: [

and by the way, I was mining BTC on my laptop in my tent at HAR in 2009, I think at a rate of 1 BTC every 4 hours or so, just to try it out. Many of those who were there and did the same are now filthy rich because of that, for what? What makes them have the right to lurk the planet of resources? What's the argument for good here?

FINACNE ? Wow. Too lazy to even spellcheck your chart, were you?
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:40:00
Except precious metal and precious stone can be used, are of actual physical value. Take down the power grid and your BTC wallet is gone.

Let me assure you: Money is not my problem. I have no debt with any bank or person, I have no outstanding loans, no mortgage, no fines, nothing. Either way, it's not about me, I don't need it to be. It's going to be your problem soon enough.

\*\*Blockchain technology doesn’t require any mining AT ALL, no cracking hashes, no crunching of numbers.\*\*A good currency does not require mining AT ALL. It’s an insane idea brought forward by virtual value backed by nothing (about the same as the one behind the yen, dollar and euro today), implying that one has to do ‘something special’ in order to create new currency. A so-called ‘proof of work’ consensus algorithm. Completely unneeded. Mining is a deplorable wasteful mechanism by which only retards think they ‘create value’. Mathematical and cryptography advancements have long surpassed any requirement of having to crunch numbers in order to ‘create’ new virtual currency. It's an idiotic idea maintained by idiots thinking because they're rich they can maintain it because others want to become rich too.Funniest fact: Bitcoin creation ends when a set amount of them has been  created by mining, thereby proving how useless the concept of wasting energy, time and resources has been all along. Its value doesn’t just disappear after they’ve all been mined! Sakamoto \[sic\] didn't write his code in order to hope halving would counter that idea. It's a joke. And you all keep falling for it.

I see you have very good arguments!

I'm prepared to bet something that's actually worth betting with that by 2023 you'll have changed your mind about \*me\* being dumb. And it's not about me, it's about resources and habitat. What you hope is there in the future will not be. Good luck trying to survive. A million trees / hour 24/7/365 are purposely being deleted from earth as we speak, for and by humans. Not being replenished/replaced. A child can see this is not a sustainable thing, in any way. You are the dumb one, I'm afraid.
