So you ended up figuring out what happened. Trojan. Nice job.
When I go to my exchanges or crypto sites I have them all bookmarked. Could a trojan change that bookmark too? What's the safest way to know you are going to the official sites?

There is now a trezor buy option on their website when you log in with the trezor hardware wallet. It uses an affiliated exchange where you can purchase with credit card. 
From trezor email: "Did you know you can now use your credit card to buy crypto in Trezor Wallet? It’s kind of a Big Deal. We partnered with Simplex, the first of many exchanges to come, so you can conveniently and securely purchase the cryptocurrency you want."

Not if you just call every decline a dip. "10k dip! 9k dip! 7k dip! See told you to BTFD." Gotta be right at some point. My favorite is when someone says "last chance to buy Bitcoin under 10k" I believe the first time I read that was May 2018. Which was actually the last time it was above 10k for more than a year.

Oh no here's some random internet guy comparing BTC to gold. Well here I go. 1st gold futures [bought in 1974]( gold was [$158/oz]( Yes it's true, more people can now make money betting for or against BTC. Yes there is manipulation. Good luck to anyone predicting future price. But there are still many who are bullish on long term price.

So how is your former neighbor spying on you remotely? They had access to you PC at some point? I dont quite understand how this is happening remotely to you. If they had access to your PC yes reformat the PC and any other PC you're worried about. Get a hardware wallet. Worth the $50-$100 depending on what you get. Trezor or ledger. Write down your seed words pen and paper not online or on any PC. Get a safe. Whatever you can afford. That's some sketchy stuff. Can you press any charges? A neighbor being this invasive is a bit strange.

That's a bad way to price point things. You're talking about the price of an asset that is thousands of years old and been used based on other currencies for still hundreds of years vs an asset since its beginning that is only 10 years old. So if you want to take the price of BTC at its creation then take the price of gold at least a few hundred years. Around 1250 AD gold per oz was .89 pound. So $100 would have purchased you 86 oz even though the dollar wasnt around yet and the price of pound to dollar always changes. And 86oz today would be worth 128k. [Gold prices over the centeries]( Basically there are too many variables to get an accurate account on gold vs btc valuation since gold has been around for soooooo much longer. If you take $100 in btc 1 year ago vs $100 in gold 1 year ago the numbers are way different.

When I was looking at [LiveCoinWatch]( yesterday it was about 13b in volume. With tether around 21b I believe. Now that was 24hr vol but cmc has been know to show some fudged numbers into the volume amount. Not always cmc fault because exchanges can fake their volumes but I wouldnt trust the volume from cmc. I dont even fully trust it from livecoinwatch but I think they are more accurate. Currently LCW says 19bil for BTC
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:09:18
I dont believe any comment in here is saying BTC is a bad choice. Simply that cherry picking the times and assets to go against are flawed. There are safer bets like gold, silver, property. Then there are much more risky bets like crypto. Generally the return on risky bets are far greater than safe ones. That's why it's called safe vs risky. It's a game of luck and fundamentals. People who bought in Dec 2017 are f'ed right now. But people who bought 2 months before that and sold to the dec people are golden. I do believe to some degree no matter when you bought if you are patient enough which could be 1-10 years from your buying time you'll be in the plus. But is the point of crypto to make more fiat? I dont think so.

@_date: 2019-12-06 17:33:26
One of the biggest reasons, I believe, alts pumped so much in late 2017 &amp; early 2018 was because BTC holders pumped those smaller caps with their BTC gains to make more money. I dont expect most alts to break their ATH until after BTC is past its ATH. To think that LTC would go from 80s to 1000s just because of halving is misinformed. Remember market cap is misleading. Just because market cap grows by $100bil doesnt mean it took $100bil worth of buying to get it there. In reality the rise from BTC $1000 to BTC $20,000 took a few billion. Maybe tens of billions but not hundreds. So it would take even less to move the price and therefore market cap of LTC, ETH, XRP, etc.

Does [this chart]( make you feel any better? You only have so many options. Sell, take the loss as a learning experience and never come back, sell and hope for a lower entry point if there is one, start DCA weekly/monthly for months to years, etc.

Would have needed the foresight to want to buy it too if that's your point.

The hype of crypto gets pretty much everyone involved at some point. We all have to do our best to leave emotion at the door with this or any market. Pay attention to the emotion of surrounding people involved in the market because that can be a good indicator of buy and sell. Always remember when the price of any asset goes up especially a significant amount it's never a bad idea to take some profit. No need to sell all at once just like it's a bad idea to buy all at once but just to lock in some gains. [Also dont forget if you happened to lose money on crypto and you are in the US you can take that as a loss for your taxes and it will subtract from your income. Up to $3000 in loss I believe. So you may get more back in tax return.](

No the [halving]( does not require a [fork.]( Halvings happen to a few coins to reduce the supply. Dont think that the halving automatically means increased price. So far the past 2 halvings have seen a large increase in price around 12-18 months after halving but that doesnt automatically mean it will happen again this time in 2020. Although many people believe a 2021 EOY increase will happen. Time will tell.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:46:56
Did you invest or did you gamble? DCA is your friend. If you have $100, $1,000, $10,000 etc to "invest" dont spend the whole thing in one buy. Dont expect to make a profit in just 2 months. That rarely happens. And if you really believe what you say these prices shouldnt cause much stress for you. If you want some hopium follow PlanB on Twitter and research stock to flow/cointegration.
@_date: 2019-12-06 17:04:50
Actually LTC did pump to around $150 a month or so before the halving. That was more of a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' thing though.
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:22:00
That is correct. So sell then buy back next day. Or sell, get a screen shot of your sell, then buy back. One thing to be aware of is holding times. Assets are normally taxed as income tax until after 1 year? I believe year 3 of holding then it's short term investment tax which is lower. After 5 years is long term investment tax, even lower. Selling will reset the clock for this. Now this tax type will apply with gains. Not losses. You wont be taxed on losses. You'll get a tax break.

If in US capital loss or gain. [If Bitcoin is held as a capital asset, you must treat them as property for tax purposes. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply. Like stocks or bonds, any gain or loss from the sale or exchange of the asset is taxed as a capital gain or loss. Otherwise, the investor realizes ordinary gain or loss on an exchange.](

IMO. You people are funny. Playing crypto vs crypto. Originally it was crypto vs fiat, or crypto vs centralized, crypto vs weak security. You all realize it will be decades and most likely generations before fiat begins to take even a 10% hit? The toxic community kills innovation. Dont get me wrong, there are over 2000 "coins" right now and yes at least 90% of them are crap. But there are different use cases. Bitcoin and most coins are adaptable. Sometimes a scam coin comes out with a promise of something that is actually useful. So real projects with backing and promise can adapt some to all of those features. Bitcoin use to be too slow and expensive to use. Now we have lightning. And that wont be the last thing btc adapts to. In my lifetime I'd be extremely surprised to see bitcoin as the only crypto being used. And by used I mean either implemented for its use case (security, speed, privacy, others) in which most people may not even know its implemented or just plain and simply used as a currency with billions going through it.
