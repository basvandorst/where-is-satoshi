I completely agree that anyone who stores anything of value on an exchange is an idiot, but I still feel *deserve* is a bit harsh.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:56:39
OP didn't *deserve* to lose anything.

Why the fuck would anyone deposit a single thing there after that?!

So they use iMessage? No, actually, they use Photoshop. SMS conversations on an iPhone have green bubbles, not blue ones... and the one-word replies aren't even centered in their bubbles.
Photoshop = lies. I'm staying away.

Yes, and their server doesn't run on an iPhone.

_Western Union?_ Bro, do you even TransferWise?

Same goes for any other type of security, including location faking (hint: you should be testing for a jailbroken device and telling the user to GTFO if so).

Would you like some Coke with that ice?
Why is it taking from a bottle? Why not just drink from the damn bottle?
So many questions here.

This is explicitly forbidden; any SEPA transfer cannot cost more than a national transfer.

The rest of the civilized world disagrees with you, and their gun crimes statistics back them up.

How about just use a different fucking printer?


Are you for real?
@_date: 2016-02-18 00:14:17
It actually does, since the gun argument is a straw man when applied to this situation.
For an example of what happened when a country ditched its handguns, look at Australia. The effect was immediate and breathtaking.

Nobody carries guns in public in Switzerland except the police, and the privately-owned guns are basically all long guns, most of which are owned by military conscripts (of which there are many, ready to go in the event shit hits the fan, in addition to the country's many bunkers).

Many printers don't keep copies of what passes through them, especially cheaper laser and inkjet printers.
Loosen your tinfoil hat a bit.

The US requires a UL certification, which is analogous to CE certification.

Where, other than Kraken, do you suggest I buy Eth? (Serious question, intended for everyone who sees it and not just OP.)
