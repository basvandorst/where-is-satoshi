Tangerine would be the closest to no fees I guess.

I always check the first and last 3 chars of the address I pasted to verify my transfers. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:07:16
Thanks for the clarification. I was getting worried.

Woah, been a while since I did a direct deposit with Virtex. Didn't know they now got accounts with BMO and Scotia. That's awesome.

With the ASIC era slowly setting in, I honestly don't see investing in GPU mining to be a good idea. You might be able to sqeeze some profit out of whatever you buy for the next 2 months, but after that the difficulty will way out of reach for anything GPU based.

Beside Blockchain.info, there's also Bitcoin Fog which is good on the Tor network.

Judging from the page, you need to send a message to the bot using this pattern : [Withdraw](
Obviously, the "ThisIsYourWithdrawBitcoinAddress" should be changed by the adress of your blockchain.info wallet. It is the long string of character next to "This Is Your Bitcoin Address".

I wouldn't call gambling an "investment". 
@_date: 2013-03-23 02:31:14
Well, sold out at 72$ this week and bought back 1700$ worth at 65.5$. Fells good.

I've contributed to various boinc projects over the past year, and I just want to mention SETI is far from being the only research out there in the boinc network. There are many more much more interesting depending on your interest. Then again I like mining too so...

$ for satoshi. Because the dollar will be worthless when regular transactions will be possible with satoshis.

I went with only a jalapeno. I'm having doubts as well it'd the device will ever pay for itself (assuming I ever received it), but comparing to your investment, 160$ is an amount I'm ready to "lose". I still believe they will deliver, but when ? Who knows. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 19:57:51
Fair enough. I'd still suggest doing a full deep pre-boot scan (if it's not already done).  
@_date: 2013-03-02 02:45:08
Yes... yes it is. Which sucks hard.

Doesn't begging for tip defeat the whole purpose behind tipping...

Regarding the hardware, I worked briefly for a R&amp;D lab a while ago and while I wasn't operating, here a few more info on what you can see : 
[This]( is a MYDATA MY9 Pick and Place (P&amp;P) machine, which, to put it simply, places electronic components on PCBs. The model shown looks like a 2006 model to me, but It's a big guess. Performance wise, depending on which headmount it has installed, it can go from 6100 component per hour (cph) for MIDAS single mount to 21000 cph for HYDRA multi mount. To compare, the new P&amp;P line from MYDATA (the MY100 series) range from 16 000 to 50 000 cph. [You can see one in the works using an HYDRA mount here]( 
As for the price, the 2000 model sells for around 25 000$, so I'd expect more for newer models.
[Next up, the essemtec RO300FC]( which is the most basic model from essemtec, but is one of the world's best selling convection oven and has won a few award I believe. Definitively not a bad machine. It is used primarly for reflow soldering. 
I found the 2005 model on sale for 10 500$.

How can you be so sure you don't have a virus ? 
@_date: 2013-02-04 23:37:03
I did. And I'm about to leave for the bar and drink one on OP. Now if only the said bar could accept BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-02 02:53:45
I read the question wrong; it's not a sync error : the "Last Price" represent the value of the last trade made on Virtex, while the numbers you see when buying/selling are the current best open orders available. The outrageous 3.00% fees add up after you click "buy" or "sell". 
@_date: 2013-02-08 19:39:31
Real =/= physical. At least in maths.
@_date: 2013-02-07 12:45:10
In other words, it takes skills. Lot of them. I wouldn't expect anyone with the qualifications you listed lower than university level to be able to design an ASIC by themselves. Unless of course you're some kind of genius or I am completely mistaken. 
Either way, OP has a long road to walk.
@_date: 2013-03-05 07:07:19
Why not just upgrade you order from August instead of placing a new one ? You'd be keeping your line in queue. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 13:03:43
Exactly. Not because they might not deliver on time (which is very likely if you ask me), but rather because such a business practice must not be encouraged at all.
@_date: 2013-02-08 20:24:25
Define real.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:08:46


Exactly. As far as we're concerned, the "valuation" axis of that graph could as well be graduated in such a way that the "Smart Money" phase is in between 0-100$. 
But then again no one can really predict how something new and young like BTC will act (which makes up half the fun if you ask me). 
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:45:06
I did not. I appreciate the gesture though, first time somebody ever tip (or at least try to) me ! I think when you reply to someone, you don't need to include the recipient.

Recently got a promotion as well ! I shall drink to yours tonight !

Chances are that you won't have the miner in hand even for the next predicted difficulty. Depending on when you placed your order, I would expect 10 to 30 times the current difficulty due to various ASIC getting into the market as you wait for your order.

+1 for Cavirtex. You can deposit money cash directly from RBC banks (I believe it is RBC). Used to do that before linking my bank account directly for direct withdrawals, which usually takes around 5 business days. Cash at counter takes less than an hour. 
OP you should stay away from shady "great deals" ads and buy on reputable places.
@_date: 2013-01-29 23:38:16
My guess is that it's from the preorder  I recently ordered a Jalapeno (not because I have any hope of getting some profitability out of it, but just because I like that kind of stuff) and my preorder # was around 17400. 
However, I don't think the number is accurate since the BTL website sends you an order confirmation (with the number) before you pay. And if you don't actually pay, well your order is void but the preorder # still got incremented. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:03:32
[And you got an answer]( ! Great job !
@_date: 2013-02-25 21:29:48
If you got one right now then yes, you would reach ROI very quickly. No doubt about that. 
@_date: 2013-02-07 17:13:07
Also, as someone mentioned in another thread, people don't often realize there are private companies developing and using asic for themselves. Avalon and BFL are just a few that decided to sell. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 18:22:57
No. Banks being closed, it cut off the fiat supply for those who want to buy. Something among those lines I think. 
@_date: 2013-02-14 04:18:05
Ordered one too and I'm also thinking the profit are going to be very sparse from it. But the investment is not that massive, so I'll just plug it on my router and let it run all day, forget about it and maybe one day find out I made *x* BTC from it.
