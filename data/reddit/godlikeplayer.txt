I'm very skeptical. Bitcoins current state of fees makes it just unsuitable for 95% of the stuff people buy on Amazon.
Why would Amazon suddenly start to accept bitcoin at its worst state while other big companies like steam abandon it and payment processors like bitpay also switching away from bitcoin?

and because it got established throughout human history as something valuable. You can go to some Chinese farmer and show him gold barren and he knows that it's valuable... try that with bitcoin...

creating money through an artificial extremely energy consuming process is not energy efficient.
In that case the FED would be the most energy efficient entitiy (or any bank for that matter) because they can create billions of dollars with a few clicks...


the service of bitcoin is basically transacting information from a to b and it does that extremely inefficient.

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:31:13
Core nodes drop transactions by default after 2 weeks, but if someone rebroadcasts a transaction the clock resets.
Also, each node operator can set their own rules for their own mempool. It is possible to run a node that never drops a transaction. Once a transaction has been signed and broadcast, it is valid forever and could be processed at any time in the future. Though most wallets make the (technically incorrect) assumption that it won't be processed after the two weeks.
If a transaction is ever "returned" to your wallet, you should move the coins again asap. Doing so is necessary to invalidate the original transaction. Other it could be processed unexpectedly at a future date.
Look up "transaction accelerator" or "replace by fee" if you want to get it moving.

i think bitcoin will enter a bearish phase
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:35:29
but most exchanges take coins without much verification and coinbase lets you buy coins with fiat without much verification
edit: I think I misunderstand your post. So you want to invest only like 40$ in bitcoin? the network fee is almost that high...
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:55:02
you are wrong, the energy consumption is increasing with the price of bitcoin. If the block reward is $25m instead of $250k then it gets more profitable to mine thus more miners will participate increasing the difficulty.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:16:24
nodes can rebroadcast the Tx and reset that timer... that's what some trolls doing right now and thus keeping these transactions in limbo forever.

again, there are several actors that could crash the market overnight be it a government, single exchanges, the core devs or even individual people.


past trends showed that bitcoin bubbled like 7 times in the past and was in a bear market for over year
the actual data shows that merchants drop bitcoin at an alarming rate and fees are exploding.
calling bitcoin a store of value is just outright lying. A store of value **stores** value **predictably** and not multiplying and halving the value on a day to day basis
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:05:28
that still doesn't make it a store of value.

huh? does anyone really use it there? with a 22$ average fee? don't think so. 
$22 is a week worth of work for people in zimbabwe...


[see darknetmarket reddit](


some companies seem to use it (via bitpay) that way, thats true. But i think even more use ripple for this.


since you have to transfer it back to $ on some shaky exchange with huge volatility i wouldn't call it reliably or fast.


it's as easy to get cross a border as it is with a normal bank account...


that would be affecting only a few people. Also offshore accounts would do the same.

funny how everyone is praising the "no counterparty risk" while chargebacks or filing dispute reduced the risk for customers getting scammed.
I mean PayPal and visa could also just process the payments and do nothing more. They could cut their whole support and dispute settlement division but that's not what the customer wants.
For example, i would never buy with bitcoin from a small shop. You just asking to get scammed... this gives big companies like Amazon even more power since they are trusted by everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:30:01
because the drop in bitcoin caused a panic that led to a drop in altcoins. Most altcoins are overvalued as hell... see dodge coin with its 750 million market cap.

LN incentivizes everyone to connect to one big hub since every node you have to go through needs liquidity and will ask for fees if they provide random people said liquidity.

most people do this. Called bank account or bonds that give you some interest.




what goes up will come down aswell at some point. Look, I copied you the definition of a store of value from Wikipedia clearly saying it needs to be predictably useful at ANY point in the future. If you think that a unregulated wild west market can be predictable then I don't know what to say.
I mean bitcoin and crypto haven't even been greenlit by the us government... there is a significant chance that they could go after exchanges and blocking bitcoin-related wire transfers because of AML or anti-terror laws... what kind of store of value would this be?

What's the point of posts like this? Just contributing to the echo chamber?

the way LN is built incentivizes people to connect to just one big hub that can decide who it wants to have a channel and whose payments it wants to route. that doesn't sound censorship resistant.


by not having miners at all? IOTA, for example, forces you to validate 2 other transactions when you make one. Not saying this is the perfect solution or the whole concept will work but its a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:02:17

@_date: 2017-12-18 00:50:12
exactly and how is locking up peoples funds not a limitation? It still needs on chain transaction to open/close channels and you will have to pay fees for every node you go through because of the frozen capital...
LN is basically a glorified and cryptographical secure gift card system and the adoption gonna be especially hard since you need two onchain transactions to buy a "giftcard" and most people would only buy one or two things a month with bitcoin anyways...
edit: Most merchants still want fiat and based on the number of stores that have ever accepted bitcoin, that will be limited, and an even smaller proportion of those hold the bitcoin rather than convert to fiat immediately.
Lightning only solves scaling if a critical mass decide to lock their bitcoin into it, and I doubt that will happen for a long time, if ever.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:29:10
50$ fees make bitcoin just unusable and thus it has no utility besides people investing in it. There is nothing bitcoin can do that another coin couldn't du much better including proper scaling.

@_date: 2017-12-12 18:06:00
because gold has demand (&gt;50%) outside of "hodl until its 1m"-investors. Stocks have some underlying value and  pays out dividends.

that's true, but gold will probably never lose like 90% of its value.
Saying people use bitcoin as a store of value right now is just kinda wrong with that amount of volatility and uncertainty. It isn't even properly regulated yet and the market is still so tiny and centralized that single person could fill every buy order on gdax and trigger every stop order.
It may be a store of value in the future but it's certainly not one right now.

in bitcoins case: merchants accepting and people paying with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:34:19
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:50:12
idk, but people have to use bitcoin or its really just hot air waiting to collapse.
And no, hodl is not using bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:26:33
yeah, let's just make bitcoin a worse gold...
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:24:51
hurt but only a little bit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:50:09


this so much
every crypto sub reads like some kind of MLM cult trying to get other people to buy into their crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:18:24
are you a girl or 13 years old?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:13:16


but you will have to open a new channel everytime you put in new funds generating an enough onchain transaction that it won't scale in a decentralized way.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:20:52
most cryptos are completely overvalued... i mean dodge coin has almost a billion market cap. That can't be right.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:19:56
not so sure
they will be fees for each node due to frozen funds...
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:34:32
it's not it bitpays fault that they cant properly refund people when there are 20$ fees.
Its also not Bitpays fault that no merchant will accept raw bitcoin and want them converted into USD which is a nightmare with bitcoins volatility
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:10:48
and its deleted
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:13:09
I like how people who actually used bitcoin and spread it get laughed at... that's why deflation is bad for the economy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:34:10
nah, they were always here
you know why they are 2-week accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:18:11
who? there is no real business I can think off excepts bitcoin directly some small indie shops and maybe overstock. Can you name me 3 mid-sized+ businesses that directly accepts bitcoin that can be verified?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:08:02
lol don't do that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:57:09
im very skeptical about bitcoin as a sole store of value. If LN turns out to be what its promised then it will generate a constant demand for needing bitcoins to buy goods and services making it stable and thus a store of value.
Without LN being a success? well, the only demand would come from people who want to Invest in it in some way or another. That kind demand can vanish overnight for various reason and this makes it prone to speculators causing huge fluctuations, bubbles, and crashes which doesn't sound like a "store of value" for me.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:15:54
[this one?](
op got owned so hard that he had to delete his account lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:09:28
you make a new channel
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:38:13
but wouldn't that mean the big blockers were right from the beginning and all the shit thrown at them were just lies?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:02:32


LN won't scale bitcoin enough. I even doubt it will find any adoption under users and merchants making it completely useless...


storing every transaction forever is a shitty idea. There are newer coins and techs that promise to solve this issue without going through some wonky workaround fix like LN.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:05:22
crypto needs a coin that is usable for everyday transactions. Don't care if its called bitcoin or dogecoin...

google 3rd generation coins / DAG coins / IOTA
not saying they are the holy grail but development beyond bitcoins capabilities is happening.

the mania is real lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:16:38

they added bcash to their API days ago.
Stop calling this insider trading... you look silly.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:33:23
that's why CCs have chargeback / people using PayPal making thus fraud a lot rarer...
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:51:30
maybe it cost 80$ fees? could be possible lol
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:03:52
cool story.
So you are just speculating... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:05:15
pretty sure most people already have bought their presents.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:27:42

@_date: 2017-12-17 02:10:58
speculation and building financial products around it...
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:14:47

@_date: 2017-12-15 21:11:31
im getting so banned for this...
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:47:08
could be a node that went offline and then online still had it stored or some trolls doing it on purpose to keep bitcoins mempool flooded.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:39:40
bitfinex also needs like 8 weeks to verify you.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:34:32
no, but bitcoin should be able to support this as a revolutionary future money that wants to replace banks and fiat... bitcoin is 8 years old and the only thing its capable of is speculating.
and no, LN won't fix everything and make it magically scaleable...
@_date: 2018-09-02 01:28:15


we could also keep reinventing the wheel over and over because we refuse to use the knowledge built up by other people.


i could also watch alex jones, study homeopathy or debate people who claim that the earth is flat in today's age.
i stick with the science and not some shitty bloggers and YouTubers who are mostly wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:17:51


yes, if it's not some kind of miner cartel since they would get back all their fees anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:39:04
nothing? they wrote they will add more altcoins and I'm pretty sure litecoin will be one of them.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:26:41
I'm sure lite coin will come soon as well.
edit: bcash is just the 3rd biggest coin by market cap and probably easier to implement since its just bitcoin with bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:45:43
nice argument
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:40:14


then you are not transacting bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:44:39
because it's an irrational bubble and no one cares about the underlying tech anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:44:39
everything is ok as long as the price increases /s
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:03
somone must be really dumb to buy at that price when every other exchagne were showing it at around 3k
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:34:57
lol, it will take months until LN is usable and will take even longer to have enough adoption to make a difference.
IF it even works or gets adopted at all.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:17:27
wtf, is this real?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:26:00
they added it to their api 2 days ago... so it was clear that bitcoin cash was coming soon to coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:26:25
that's in a year and would need a completely different setup
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:38:55
no, bitcoin just sucks right now... can take a few days until your coins arrive.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:30:19
oh sorry, I think we misunderstood.
I just was hinting at the enormous fees bitcoin has compared to all the other coins
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:56:23


@_date: 2017-12-12 23:08:48
agreed until he tried to add "armored trucks" and "light of the office tower" to a single transaction. Completly lost his credibility for me.
They have nothing to do with a transaction. If you could make physical bitcoins you would have to transport them in armored trucks as well... comparing this is just dumb.
Banks do far more than just transactions... these are mostly done automatically by computers nowadays.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:50:12


doing normal wire transactions? the transaction itself has almost no energy footprint since a few sql servers can handle millions of transaction per second...
and no... armored trucks and bank office towers have nothing to do with bank transactions. There are enough internet banks that can handle alot more traffic than bitcoin while consuming a fraction of bitcoins enegery.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:48:07


but not in a truly decentralized way (big ISPs, routing nodes, DNS servers, ICANN)... also LN is a little bit more complex aswell since it need to find a route with enough balance and has the lowset fee.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:49
bitcoin cash is the 3rd biggest coin. Why shouldn't they add it?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:44:26


bitcoin can be divided to trillions of units...
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:51:09
yes this is the case right now at this very moment.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:33:08
probably the right decision.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:59
that's not true
the utility will win and if they die they weren't useful in the first place.
A lot of useless cryptos need to be removed...
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:59:04
and bitcoin doesn't even manage to become that...
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:33:37


4 years is a bit long but LN needs to be adopted and software needs to be developed around it. This can still take quite a while...
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:43:19
bigger blocks are a way to scale but with the side effect of centralization

buying a **house in a city** is not really feasible for most people across the globe. Also people in cities usually earn more than people from rural areas so you can't really compare these two incomes in an average as well.
for example, an apartment in London, Paris or Munich can cost you up to a million while you would get the same apartment for less than 100k in a rural area.... Same is true for cities like new york or silicon valley where you will never be able to pay for a real estate if you work in a rural area.
also a lot people pay of their houses over a course of 30+ years

Fiat money can be **both** digital and physical. We **choose to have physical notes** because old people who don't have internet need banking too. 
If you want the same with bitcoin you will have to make bitcoin IOUs that need to be protected by armored trucks and handed out in banks with actual people in it.
can your brain comprehend that????

@_date: 2017-12-12 23:41:32
i know but that problem itself is caused by the fees making refunds expensive and impossible to pay up 50 cent difference with a second transaction. With low fees, he could just have tried again with the new price.

superior tech is superior tech. Noone would care about bitcoin if an alt could insta transact value with zero fees in a secure and stable network. It does matter if this is protected by patents or not.


Will these new techs work? idk for sure. People will call them a scam or naive like they did with bitcoin 8 years ago.
But I know for sure that the blockchain tech was just the first step and will progress regardless of bitcoins ability to adapt or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:50:22
most merchants only accept bitcoin through bitpay or similar. Noone is currently buying anything with bitcoin due to insane fees...
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:50:22


because they have a very small market cap and a single institutional investor can bring it down. IOTA, for example, had a 10X increase in price within a few weeks.


no, I certainly not new.


The difference is that the first time in bitcoins history its adoption is going backward. Merchants and DNM have all dropped bitcoin within the last few months and now people start to realize that bitcoins success and dominance are not as sure as people thought would be.

who says that this is not true?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:07:45
yeah you can, but this costs on chain fees. Doesn't make much sense to put in $50 into the LN when the two onchain fees are $100;
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:26:31


not everything is about you? people are shilling for their coins so they increase their investment value by acquire new investors. That's what people in MLMs and Ponzi schemes do as well. The sub is full of fake news, lies, and astroturfing because of that... like any other crypto sub...


does it have to be a single entity? does it change the outcome?  I mean bubbles and crypto ico's are even listed as similar schemes on the Ponzi Wikipedia page.

you mean everybody stood and dabbed.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:17:09


that has not much to do with gold as a dominant store of value. Its just demand for it besides using it as a store of value.


gold got established as a store of value over thousands of years and there are no signs that other alloys suddenly overtake gold as a store of value and statistics say it won't change with a very high probability.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:45
yeah true,
I don't even believe that LN will be adopted at all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:50:14
bitcoin cash will solve nothing in the long run as well. I think other altcoins will win the crypto war.
@_date: 2018-09-03 18:01:08
then read up the Wikipedia article i have linked
" The point of any store of value is risk management due to a stable demand for the underlying asset. Money is one of the best stores of value because of its liquidity, that is, it can easily be exchanged for other goods and services."
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:38:24
2nd layer solution like the LN are just a band-aid fix that with heavy limitations that will also need huge blocks if it ever will be properly adopted (it won't). Maybe blockchain based coins as a whole just aren't capable scaling this much and won't ever deliver a proper currency.
Maybe DAG coins or further evolved concepts will be capable of delivering what bitcoin promised and still is promising.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:36:31
not having a working product but promises worth billions reminds me of the dotcom bubble...
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:24:33
the government decides the legal tender and they won't give up their monopoly on money so easily, even if cryptocurrencies will finally be more efficient and scalable.
Also, banks do a lot more than just routing people money.

Europe wakes up in a few hours. Probably a lot of further panic selling.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:17:00
how can bitcoin has a lasting security? the hashrate can vanish overnight and already did so in the past. The whole centralization of miners in china alone is a huge security risk that other coins can avoid. 
Also, no blockchain will be able to scale to visa levels and still be decentralized. Even if LN gets adopted it still would need like 100mb blocks if they want to scale to visa levels and LN itself is centralized through hubs.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:03:37
looks like bitcoin had its peak. I don't think we will see another bull run until the fees are getting lower again.
@_date: 2018-09-20 05:10:12
because bitcoin fees are even higher...
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:45:16

@_date: 2017-12-14 17:30:42


but that's just speculating. People speculate that bitcoin is becoming a solid store of value.


but compare this to gold. I can put 100% of my savings in gold and can be sure that in 10 years its still something worth. I cant say that with bitcoin... it could be rendered worthless by next year or worth a million.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:17:12
i was a bit skeptical about that spamming attack but this sure looks like one.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:44:20
i looked through your lists and most businesses I know from name only accept bitcoin through 3rd party services like bitpay or coinbase (so they turn bitcoin into $ aka they accept $ and not bitcoin).
Quite a few are listed where you can only spend your bitcoin via gift cards that you buy from another site...
Some on that list never actually accepted bitcoin. Subway is listed as a chain while in reality, ONE subway store happens to accept bitcoin, not the whole chain...
A lot removed bitcoin again like steam and I looked up like 15 smaller ones with no indications that you still can spend bitcoin there.
The rest are joke sites like bitcoincoffee.com (porn site now) or 4chan or simply dont exist anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:43:58

yes, at least these are not some letterbox companies.
A lot of exchanges got hacked and lost its customers bitcoins... all of them are currently completely overwhelmed and cant guarantee proper support and have annoying withdraw limits.
I mean it's a general advice from the community NOT letting money or bitcoins on an n exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:15:20


are you talking about gourl.io? idk... never heard about them. They don't even have a wikipedia page.
not even sure if they are even legit?






it was a simple question. A **mid-sized business** that **directly accepts bitcoin** and **not converting it to cash through bitpay or coinbase or similar services**. I did the work checking like 25 sites in a somewhat random order on that list trying to find a business meeting these specifications. 
It's an 8-year-old p2p online cash system worth a quarter of a trillion. It cant be that hard to name me a few known sites that directly accept bitcoin and keep them that I can look up and verify.

this energy consumption is nothing compared to the BTC network. These are just a few SQL servers and not supercomputers solving hashes... then maybe a office and a few people and do a lot more transactions a day than bitcoin.


[and yet most miners sit in China next to a coal plant](


renewable energy is not competitive in terms of costs compared to nuclear power or coal. Why do you think we have a debate for decades about renewable energy and we need to be subsidized and basically enforced by law when they would be cheaper...


that's biggest bullshit I have ever heard.

We don't know if LN even delivers or people gonna adopt it since it has limitations. LN will probably take years for the software to be developed around it and people starting to adopt it to a point where it makes a difference.
It looks more like the whole blockchain tech will never be able to scale regardless how many layers you gonna put in. You can scale long enough with simple block size increase until it starts getting centralized... at that time 3rd or even 4th generation coins probably be developed far enough to take over from there.

Core nodes drop transactions by default after 2 weeks, but if someone rebroadcasts a transaction the clock resets.
Also, each node operator can set their own rules for their own mempool. It is possible to run a node that never drops a transaction. Once a transaction has been signed and broadcast, it is valid forever and could be processed at any time in the future. Though most wallets make the (technically incorrect) assumption that it won't be processed after the two weeks.
If a transaction is ever "returned" to your wallet, you should move the coins again asap. Doing so is necessary to invalidate the original transaction. Other it could be processed unexpectedly at a future date.
Look up "transaction accelerator" or "replace by fee" if you want to get it moving.
im kind shocked that so few people know about this

@_date: 2017-12-12 20:14:34
by choosing what I think is the best method to buy stuff? if bitcoin would be instant and had no fees I would buy bitcoin and use it to buy stuff instead of using PayPal.
Even if everyone on this planet has some bitcoins it still would be no adoption if no one would use it and no shop would offer it as a payment option. Adoption has nothing to do with how many people hold bitcoin. Either its better than its competition and gets used or it's not used and thus uncompetitive and worthless.
People THINK (SPECULATE) that bitcoin will have some serious adoption with LN but this is clearly not the case right now.

an investment that can only stay afloat as long as new investors can be found while having no intrinsic value (utility)? that's very similar to a Ponzi, my friend.


other coins could scale way better / are build from the ground up to properly scale. Ether already does way more transaction per sec that bitcoin and DAG coins or proof of stake concept making mining and fees obsolete while keeping a decentralized architecture. Bitcoin is the dinosaur of cryptocoins and will never able to scale in a decentralized way because of it heavy technological debt it has to carry.

"Let's say you have 5 million users, each of whom opens and closes a channel once a month on average, and who make zero other bitcoin transactions. That's 10 million transactions per month. Channel open/close transactions are about 500 bytes each, so that's 5,000 MB per month. At 144 blocks per day, 30 days per month, this would be 1.16 MB of lightning channel open/close transactions per block. This leaves nearly zero space for non-lightning transactions."

i have my doubts that LN gets adopted at all.
The break-even point would be around 3 transactions per channel opening. Thing is, most people don't send Bitcoin transactions very often, so Lightning won't help much with the way people currently use Bitcoin.

it's not an assumption that bitcoin is a very risky investment. There is even a thread stickied that you should not invest recklessly.
Bitcoin is still quite small and single people can have a huge influence on bitcoins future. Maybe the core devs scrap bitcoin and make new coin... or satoschi comes back and dumps his million bitcoins... or some new coin comes up with a better tech and being even more decentralized and secure and so on and so forth. There are a lot of single individuals or small groups that can ruin bitcoin for whatever reason.
Bitcoin is also currently in the process to be regulated and we don't know how this will play out.

the mt.gox crash was pretty close at least. 


or it could make it very uninteresting for a lot of users and speculators. Look, bitcoin is solely backed by investors who can pull out their money when they want and they will if no profits can be made anymore. There is no real demand (yet) from people using it as currency and thus its only backed by people who want to make quick money.
Bitcoin also has a lot of technological issues. Noone knows if the LN can deliver what it promises and how the market will react... 3rd generation coins promise fee less and faster transaction compared to bitcoin while being as secure and even more decentralized. If these coins can deliver, what point has bitcoin then?...
investing in bitcoin is like buying a stock from a single company... it can go well can go very bad but this is unpredictable.

Bitcoin is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has "invest responsibly" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea. 
Bitcoin has still zero regulations and huge whale like the Winklevoss twins could crash the market overnight... how can you call this a store of value i can bank on over years?

I see "Bitcoin accepted here" very very rarely in Europe and the few times saw it and could talk to the owner it turned out that they never realized a sale and are just privately invested in crypto. 
who the fuck does even use bitcoin right now for everyday purchases with its 20$ fees and increasing value? no one except some because of ideological reasons.

from the BoE website:
Take our target for inflation, for example. The Government sets the target – which is 2%. Independence for monetary policy – which we’ve had since May 1997 – **means that we set interest rates (and ‘quantitative easing’) at what we consider to be the most appropriate level** to achieve the inflation target. A committee meets to agree on these decisions eight times a year.
that bold sentence kinda contradicts the statement that the government having the say-so over QE.


no, i don't know. Also, the "official stance" is that the BoE and the uk gov need both to approve QE. May also have changed after the financial crisis in favor of a more independent BoE. 


that is what you are doing. the government still doesn't print money :)

but that's also one of the bitcoins most fundamental problems everyone tries to solve. Let's assume the 3rd generation coins can deliver and provide zero fees, instant anonymous transactions (not saying they will deliver). How will bitcoin be able to compete with this? LN and other off chain solutions won't remove fees and are still faaaar away of allowing bitcoin to scale to visa levels...

@_date: 2018-09-05 21:41:47


politicians write a lot.


because the market went south? that can happen in a free market... the principles in the QE case still apply because the BoE buys only some of the government bonds circulating in the market meaning the interest rates the UK government has to pay are still bound to the market. aka supply &amp; demand and the creditworthiness of the uk government


again, politicians write a lot...
Surely, the BoE has operational frameworks set by government but executes those policies “independently”, reporting publicly on its decisions. If there is any influence behind the scene then it's a Uk specific problem.


it's still not the government printing money. If the government could issue money to themselves THEN they would print money. With QE the government still pays interest rates ultimately decided by the banks and private investors.
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:51:20


there are communist, right wing extremists and other european parlaments aswell... doesnt make the bs they are writing any more credible.
Redwood is a hardcore brexiter and small-government philosoph and texts like these are in line with his politics and voter base...
i posted the offical version from the BoE website... should be at least as credible..








QE is done at the behest != forced to run a QE. Ofc there needs to be some kind of coordination but the government having a veto/has to greenlit it means that the chances of QE happening is even lower.

but people like you don't seem to understand that you have to make an onchain transaction everytime you want to refill your LN "gifcard".

you can only earn and spend it because it can be converted to fiat. A merchant can't accept bitcoin if he can't turn it back into fiat to pay his own suppliers.
as for now, bitcoin is as far away from money as it can get... its neither stable nor a measure of value and thus also not a proper medium of exchange. It's not even a proper store of value in its current form...

poor people are the least affected by inflation since the largest part of their savings is their own human capital and deflation would hit them even harder.

like I said: QE is a kinda border case.
"Well first of all, Parliament has given us very specific goals and responsibilities. For each one, we have specific tools we can use to meet our objectives.
Take our target for inflation, for example. The Government sets the target – which is 2%. Independence for monetary policy – which we’ve had since May 1997 – means that we set interest rates (and ‘quantitative easing’) at what we consider to be the most appropriate level to achieve the inflation target. A committee meets to agree on these decisions eight times a year."
"for interest rates, for financial stability, and for the regulation of banks and insurance companies. And we carry those out, for the good of the people of the United Kingdom, within a framework set by Government but **free from day-to-day political influence.**"

I was giving the example of Argentina, but the list is endless: A lot of countries do everything by the book, and the market still punishes them. There was no specific trigger of Argentina doing something bad currently, it's that EMs are now squeezed because of the dollar.
Argentina has a looooong history of corruption. They also defaulted several times on their own terms making noone want to lend them money.
Bitcoin won't solve any of these debt and corruption problems.

i also have my doubts about the scalability of the LN. Not sure how often people will have to open a channel and how the watchers going to work. Sound not like something people would adopt.
The current LN route-finding algorithm requires every channel payment to be sent to every user, because each user is supposed to find paths for his own payments. At some point, this will be way too much data for each user to handle... how can this scale in a decentralized way?

Core nodes drop transactions by default after 2 weeks, but if someone rebroadcasts a transaction the clock resets.
Also, each node operator can set their own rules for their own mempool. It is possible to run a node that never drops a transaction. Once a transaction has been signed and broadcast, it is valid forever and could be processed at any time in the future. Though most wallets make the (technically incorrect) assumption that it won't be processed after the two weeks.
If a transaction is ever "returned" to your wallet, you should move the coins again asap. Doing so is necessary to invalidate the original transaction. Other it could be processed unexpectedly at a future date.
Look up "transaction accelerator" or "replace by fee" if you want to get it moving.

because it allows reacting to economics swings and prevents deflation among other things like being able to issue money when needed.

lel, you should read the whole paragraph and i like how you can't comprehend the phrase "we set" which is not "we calculate" or "we suggest" or "we propose" or "we organise" or "we implement". 
"Take our target for inflation, for example. **The Government sets the target** – which is 2%. Independence for monetary policy – which we’ve had since May 1997 – means that **!we! set interest rates (and ‘quantitative easing’)** at what we consider to be the most appropriate level to achieve the inflation target.
to make a closer comparison to your example:
* government orders the army to invade another country 
*  =
* The Government sets the target – which is 2%
* the army works out how many men are needed, but the authorisation, the orders to doso 
* !=
* we set interest rates (and ‘quantitative easing’) at what we consider to be the most appropriate level to achieve the inflation target. 
so the government SETS the inflation target
and the BoE SETS the rates (and QE) to meet these targets
the BoE the authorization to use these tools since its independence. At least that is what the BoE quote is saying. you fail.
from Wikipedia:

are you dumb? every LN channel needs two transactions.
"Let's say you have 5 million users, each of whom opens and closes a channel once a month on average, and who make zero other bitcoin transactions. That's 10 million transactions per month. Channel open/close transactions are about 500 bytes each, so that's 5,000 MB per month. At 144 blocks per day, 30 days per month, this would be 1.16 MB of lightning channel open/close transactions per block. This leaves nearly zero space for non-lightning transactions."
now do the math on how large the blogs have to be if LN wants to support 500mio people + other onchain transactions.
The current LN route-finding algorithm requires every channel payment to be sent to every user, because each user is supposed to find paths for his own payments and thats impossible for 100k tps.

"Core nodes drop transactions by default after 2 weeks, but if someone rebroadcasts a transaction the clock resets.
Also, each node operator can set their own rules for their own mempool. It is possible to run a node that never drops a transaction. Once a transaction has been signed and broadcast, it is valid forever and could be processed at any time in the future. Though most wallets make the (technically incorrect) assumption that it won't be processed after the two weeks.
If a transaction is ever "returned" to your wallet, you should move the coins again asap. Doing so is necessary to invalidate the original transaction. Other it could be processed unexpectedly at a future date.
Look up "transaction accelerator" or "replace by fee" if you want to get it moving."

the Uk government doesn't print money. The Bank of England can increase the money supply through various instruments like just lending to banks  that lend further to the private and public sector.


actually, bad money drives out good. People would mostly try to pay their bills with GBP in your case and bitcoin would gradually disappear from circulation. If the inflation is not extremely high and GBP stays a legal tender.

that's your opinion and there is no argument to be made here.


obviously, a government is in favor of a central bank buying government bonds from the private sector and thus increasing the demand for such bonds.... but that's not a contradiction to an independent central bank.


some badly written conspiracy bs.


wrong? you claiming every post that "the (uk) government printing money" while it's the corresponding central bank who is issuing money. It's a fundamental concept that a central bank is separated from the government and not directly lending money to the ruling government. QE is kinda close to violating that principle but since the central bank has to buy these bonds from the private sector the market principles still apply.

"The use of gold as money began thousands of years ago in Asia Minor."
"Fiat money originated in 11th century China,[14] and its use became widespread during the Yuan and Ming dynasties.
 but got replaced by fiat"
**claim 2: gold as money got replaced by fiat.**
" Fiat money started to dominate in the 20th century. Since the decoupling of the US dollar from gold by Richard Nixon in 1971, a system of national fiat currencies has been used globally."

QE is a border case but still doesn't violate the principle of an independent central bank. The Uk government can't run QE without the BoE riding along. 


you just trying to evade my point. The UK government doesn't "print money". the government would be printing money if they would issuing new money which can only be done by the BoE. 
If you qualify QE as "printing money" (which is also wrong) then only the BoE can do it with the approval of the Uk government... see? still not the UK government "printing money" like you have claimed.
[Also, the BoE can't buy the bonds directly from the Uk government which makes even less a case for "the Uk government is printing money".](
the only thing that QE affect the government directly is that they have to pay less interest (due to higher demand) for loans... that is not what I would consider under "government is printing money".
for that statement to be correct the government would have to issue the money on their own or force the central bank to buy bonds directly from the government because they would be able to get interested free loans this way (since the government gets all the profits the central bank makes). 
so your statement is factually wrong.


here a study looking at the independence of the BoE.
"The findings support the Bank of England model of monetary policy independence: **fully operationally independent**, but somewhat politically dependent. To make operational independence work,"
"Twenty years after independence, the case for **Bank of England operational independence remains strong.** At the same time, the new powers it has acquired since the financial crisis require a new framework to reconcile operational independence with effectiveness and accountability. "
also, the official statements form the BoE which you discounted as evidence. You gonna find every opinion on the internet... especially on new sites and blogs.

"the first four years following the First World War, the situation for German civilians remained dire. The severe food shortages improved little to none up until 1923. Many German civilians expected life to return to prewar normalcy following the removal of the naval blockade in June 1919. Instead, the struggles induced by the First World War persisted for the decade following. Throughout the war German officials made rash decisions to combat the growing hunger of the nation, most of which were highly unsuccessful. Examples include the nationwide pig slaughter, Schweinemord, in 1915. The German government's rationale behind exterminating the population of swine in Germany was to decrease the use of potatoes and turnips for animal consumption, transitioning all foods toward human consumption. In 1922, now three years after the German signing of the Treaty of Versailles, meat consumption in the country had not increased since the war era. 22 kg per person per year was still less than half of the 52 kg statistic in 1913, before the onset of the war.

sure but the hash power is related to how much money miners can get. Higher block reward = higher energy consumption.
and the block reward increases a lot if the usage and thus fees and bitcoin price rise during a global adoption.

there are 2 different things. There are these contactless cards with NFC or RFID chips payments where the credit institute takes the risk if fraud happens.
And there are these eleconic cash cards that needs to be swiped and either needing a pin or you sing a receipe giving the merchant the allowance to withdraw that money from you bank account.
"The cardholder presents the card at the point of sale (POS) and this is swiped through the payment terminal by the assistant or the customer, inserted into a chip and PIN device or read by a contactless reader. The payment is authorized by the card issuer to ensure that the cardholder has sufficient funds in their account to make the purchase and the cardholder confirms the payment by either signing the sales receipt or entering their 4- to 6-digit PIN,"
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:10:06

how money companies use bitcoin and LN directly and not over some 3rd party processor? very few.


currently, with LN you would need to make an on chain to get your bitcoin out LN, then another on chain transaction to put into a 3rd part processor/exchange which will send the money to your bank account after they have processed it.
and if I would have to pick a random processor I would pick [PayPal or similar]( which would credit the money on my account immediately. Ofc I have to transfer it to my bank account as well.
which again, will have increased costs when bitcoin transaction prices rise since an on chain transaction is needed to put bitcoin in and out of the LN. do you understand how it works? there will also be routing fees and costs for [liquidity providers]( if it will ever see some adoption.
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:24:15


that doesn't make sense for me. If the cost per unit of energy produced with coal is cheaper why wouldn't they just build coal plants when they know they can run at 100% at any time with bitcoin miners.  Hell, mining makes huge ass plants like nuclear power plant even more competitive since they can always run at full capacity making their marginal costs per kwh even lower.
@_date: 2018-10-28 12:33:11

again, putting money into a bank account is essentially lending them money with the risk of losing it. There are insurances and they hold certain reserves to minimize that risk of losing it all.

@_date: 2018-10-28 16:27:26


currently, there are none who would do these with a reasonable amount of dollar. If big exchanges will ever adopt LN directly they will run in huge security risks by handling such amount of LN funds which is basically a hot wallet.


yes, actually I have. Paypal handles everything and I don't care if the customer bought with PayPal funds or credit card or bank wire since I get the money from PayPal.


IS there a serious exchange that does that?

"Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but is required to hold reserves equal to only a fraction of its deposit liabilities.[1]"

why would people want to give up their control over their money that they have through their government representing them? The economic implications of deflationary cryptocurrencies with a fixed supply could be devastating and now way to change anything about it through a democratic process.

they can simply increase the supply by lending out bitcoins.

yeah, that makes an exchange different from a bank but they easily COULD let people withdraw that lend bitcoins or money which would make them a bank. Also, there were many cases where bitcoins got stolen from exchanges and yet no customer account balance changes nor did any customer lose any of their coins.

@_date: 2018-11-03 11:02:03




exactly, the exchange owns the bitcoins and they can loan them further as they wish because YOU lend them these bitcoins


so there can be fractional reserve in a bitcoin economy...an exchange only need to hold a fraction of actual bitcoin to stay liquid while they could lend out loans 10x of the value their customers have deposited. Zero difference between bitcoin and fiat here.

yes, i know. the point still stays that no bitcoin changes a wallet when you do trade on an exchange like no physical USD moves when you do a bank transaction.


not sure if some exchanges already offer this. I don't see why not except lack of demand for such a trading option.

@_date: 2018-11-25 00:23:12


well, but not many. Even the strongest holder has to sell at some point and if he needs to sell 1k bitcoin and the total demand would be 500 then guess what the actual price gonna be.


adoption? usages besides being a speculative investment? peoples interest in bitcoin? 


probably not to zero cents but low enough to be considered junk by the majority. This doesn't mean that some major event like google promoting bitcoin can lead to another bull run... but that's just gambling.

@_date: 2018-11-02 23:27:36


ofc you can the same way you can do with fiat money. A bank (or anyone with credibility) can lend out as many bitcoin IOUs as they want.
If you put your bitcoin on an exchange then you get an IOU shown in your account balance and the exchange could aswell lend, lose or do anything with the actual bitcoin  while your account balance is still the same... and i think with coinbase you can even go and buy stuff with that account balance even while it may not be fully backed.

the point is that these "finacial things" can be applied to bitcoin aswell... there isnt much difference between having a private key or holding fiat cash in your hands.


why shouldn't you be able too? as long as the exchange or bitcoin bank is liquid they can let people withdraw. If everyone wants to withdraw at the same time you have the same effects as you have with bank run on a traditional fiat bank.

it is comparable in that both can't make proper decisions... the drug addicts actually proved that they can't make a proper drug-related decision.

all banks work pretty much the same by determining "creditworthiness" of consumers and companies. If the asymmetry would be so high that it could cover the expenses for some banks then the other banks would have go bust on a daily basis.

if teenagers can't make decisions on their own why would someone intoxicated or addicted be able to do so? Also how far should this "just let them" go? assisting someone with suicide or severe self-harm?


local bitcoin, ask someone who is older to buy bitcoin for you... like I did when I started smoking as a teen... I'm very smart now? lol




no, people with mental problems of any kind should not have access to guns. Common sense... if completely banning guns will keep it away from criminals and mentally ill people is another topic.

you are right. Forgot it since there is a word in my native language that includes both.


you can use the contract someone owing a debt to as money. This means you can pay back debt with other debt like its done today. In your case, the Lender has 130k while the borrower has 100k that can circulate within an economy (230k).
