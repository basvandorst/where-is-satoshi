I appreciate you editing your post, that's a step in the right direction. 
The user that provided an explanation of what I meant by "stoop" is right. I am not against Q&amp;As I do them all the time. I just don't have an interest on coming in to a loose loose scenario where folks are not actually looking for answers. 
The majority of the users here have no idea what they are talking about, they just regurgitate the same things over and over again. Without any evidence or proof. 
Just like you guys complain hashtalk.org users do. Or, they down vote anyone that opposes them, just like you guys claim hashtalk.org users do. 
My point is there is not upside in trying to have a rational and respectful conversation to those that do not want to be rational and respectful. I am sure that makes sense. 
Out of respect for your effort here, I will talk to my PR team about your request. I am happy to answer questions in a reasonable discussion.

Many are not looking to get answers.  If they were, they would not be blurting out words like Ponzi with no proof. 
Additionally, despite popular belief, I rarely ever ban. This was a escape tactic used by mods so they did not have to deal with the confrontation created after they banned someone. I have put it to a stop. 
In any case, I will be addressing the community as a whole about this next week. I do not agree with either extremes. I do not agree with our fans down voting those that have serous and critical questions. 
In fact, I think it makes our industry look just was bad when people blindly believe, just as much as many of the trolls here. Do not misquote me, I am not saying I feel most hashtalk.org blindly believe. The majority are well balanced. My point is I think both extremes reflect poorly on the industry. 
Finally, I do not understand the negativity here. While there are a handful of reasonable people (which is why I am talking to you) many are out of control. In almost all cases, they have formed opinions with no evidence, taken something out of context, or only heard what they want to hear.
You can say the confusion about the merchants coinfire reported on is bad for the industry. But, they way they handled it was just as bad. What do you think a person just thinking of getting in this space thinks when they see, what should be a news publication, posting emails, trashing companies, and airing out legal notices? When does it stop? I think everyone needs to step back. 
I want to be clear, should I participate, it will not be to defend gaw. It will be to help put a stop to some of the things that go on here and make the entire industry look bad to the outside world. 
I am ok if you like us or not. But handle things in a way that does not keep new people from being interested in crypto. Show some level of respect so the outside world can see that this is not just a bunch of weirdos. Rather, that this industry can truly change the world.

not sure why your sending? I did not write that?

I can answer the real question you're asking. To date, we (the entire company) has not made a penny from anything Paycoin or PayBase related.

We are not justifying it, we are working on a solution :) I wanted to make sure you knew we were not running away, that we intend to make things right.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:35:47
I do not know what happened 
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:43:34
I refuse to answer questions while being degraded and disrespected. We are taking the questions from here and going to put all the answers in one place.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:52:29
Do you intend for this to be productive? I am not here to argue

the person sold us faulty hardware. After many attempts to work out a refund, I had to open a case with PayPal. They posted that as a result
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:04:44
Sorry, but I can not answer questions in an environment when people are sending things like this.
My team and I are taking down all the questions posted here and will put the answers up in one central place so they are easy to find for everyone.
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:07:10
thats right, I can not properly answer questions when I am getting sent things like this
