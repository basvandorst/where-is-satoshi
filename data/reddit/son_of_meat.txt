Ah the Friendly Toast! Two years ago my girlfriend and I sat in that restaurant and resolved to move to California. Now here we are, but I've still been following the Bitcoin scene in Cambridge a bit. It seems pretty vibrant. Heck didn't they just give every MIT undergrad $50 in BTC?!? The Friendly is like a block from campus. They should totally take bitcoin.

No we shouldn't. If you have time on your hands, please contribute instead to Wikipedia or the dedicated bitcoin wiki en.bitcoin.it.

Rad! That changes the equation dramatically in the contributors favor. There's not much meaning though then to the statement that there's "10,000,000 total coins" since the unvested coins have no value and more can be minted if need be.

We can call it royalties if you prefer. I just want to back-envelope how much I can expect to earn for the time I invest. A web engineer in your Silicon Valley makes like $10,000 per month. Let's compare to the assembly project. ["Create a new GUI for bitcoind"]( gets me 25,000 coins. On the conservative side, as a good web engineer that would take me like a month. As I understand it, I'd then be entitled to roughly 0.25% of $1 (i.e. 0.25 cents) per device since I'd have 25,000 out of the total 10,000,000 coins. Even if you sell 10,000 units, which I think is optimistic considering there are currently not even 10,000 full nodes total on the planet, I'll only earn $250, a factor of 50 below my market rate. So I should be thinking of the assembly coins as being worth only slightly more than nothing, not something approaching even a basic income. My question: Could you please check the above math, assumptions, and conclusions?
@_date: 2015-05-21 07:26:16
Just to put some numbers to it, I do in fact have 10,000 coins and only like 20,000 have been awarded thus far. So I expect my first distribution to be tens of dollars. To be sure, that's better than a stick in the eye, but as a wage rate it's effectively zero.

Am I correct in interpreting your answer to mean that my analysis isn't inaccurate?

Uh oh. Hug of death is upon you.

There was already a sea of contributor ACKs and only two NACKs, one of which was Cobra-Bitcoin's, the guy who rammed the change through in the first place. The ACK brigade only showed up later at which point Theymos locked the thread. Several days later now after bullying Brian Armstrong into making a pro-Core statement, the thread was summarily unlocked by Theymos and pulled by David Harding.

I installed the updated iOS version on my iPhone 6 and it's crashing every time I open it. Anyone else having that problem?

Why is JavaScript "in no way suitable" for running a full node? BitPay is working on this too. [Source]( 
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:11:49
The contribution to the assembly project is $1 per device. Do you know the approximate wage rate that works out to given your sales projections?

"This PR is kind of confusing because there are so many ... meaningless ACKs".

Why did you choose to use a .org top-level domain when you've incorporated as a for-profit entity? I see bitseed.io is still available...

Btcdrak is a major contributor, but by no means is this "his" website. They (at least Luke-jr) are [planning on hosting Bitcoin Core binaries there]( Wladimir van der Laan owns the domain bitcoinco.re, soon to be bitcoincore.org.
@_date: 2015-08-27 23:44:52
That's news to me. I believe you, but could you provide evidence for that assertion?
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:29:38
It's my understanding that bitcoin.org was given to him by Satoshi. So it wouldn't be so unreasonable to ask him to give that away. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 15:24:47
What work was done on the "backend portions of the site"? Anything we'd want to pull over to bitcoin.org?
@_date: 2015-08-28 04:18:38
Wowza. Two weeks ago I knew he was in charge of this sub and bitcointalk. Then I had my mind blown in learning that he owned bitcoin.org. Now this. INSANITY.

Der, yeah it is. It's a fork of bitcoin.org. Check out the source code. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 11:48:13
Nobody contributes to bitcoin.org anymore because of the behavior of the site owners. I strongly believe we need to migrate the Bitcoin Core documentation to a non-bitcoin.org domain because as you see, it's getting out of date.

Ditto. I received several emails about it from the Foundation. The stated reason for only allowing "active" members to vote is that it's hard to get a quorum otherwise.

If you're going to post about Coinbase, consider using .
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:30:18
Thanks RIICKY, that's rad. I wonder if there's a place where these types of things could be collected and archived for general use. For example, some kind fella on the bitcoin forums made these nice graphics  , but how would the average Jane ever find that or this unless she knew where to look. I'm thinking that maybe the folks at bitcoin.org would be interested in taking this on, or perhaps bitcoinfoundation.org.

exists, should be used.

You can and should enable a pin for the Coinbase app in its settings screen. You're right that "enabled" should be the default.
