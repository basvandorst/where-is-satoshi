Yes, I've read your links. Heard it all before, four years ago.

Okay... I'm just getting back into following along with everything after staying out of Bitcoin news for a couple years...
Can you explain to me exactly how this is different from Gox?
Based on everything I've read from all sides this smells exactly like Gox, trading USDT/USD feels like trading BTC/BTCGOX. 
My gut is telling me to keep my USD in my bank account until after everything tanks 30%-40%. Convince me my gut is wrong?
Edit: I don't mind being downvoted, but I'd really like to hear a good reason how this isn't just a psychological run-up based on the obviously inflated BFX price? So far I've seen links to "Oh, we're solvent! We're gonna get an audit!" and "Oh AML reforms are definitely the reason this totally solvent exchange has disabled withdrawals!"
I'm all about the moon, I have a strong feeling that cryptocurrency is going to be a big part of future consensus reality, but still can't tell how this isn't Gox 2.0.

The problem is that bitcoin value is still primarily speculative. Sure, it has a few more use cases but technological superiority and marketing are still huge.
If BFX is causing this rally and lying, when it corrects if even one alt defies the correction downwards speculators are going to be very interested. ETH is the one I'm keeping my eye on, not because of any superiority to BTC but because they show well to a speculator. For the first time a market correction just might see a large amount of capital move to another coin not back to fiat.
It's for sure an interesting time in crypto.

Sorry to break this to you, but the past would suggest life is mostly a game of jumping bubble to bubble.

Certainly, some bubbles are surfed by generations. It remains to be seen how long the BTC bubble lasts for.

I'd call the both of 'em idiomatic fractals. 
But hey, I'm speculating on BTC with everybody else here!

I'd love to participate.
