 I Would. They removed my account holding $500 BTC 1LTC 1ETH this morning for no reason, after a month of trading, and my Coinbase wallets are all now empty. My pending transactions all came through my bank account at the same exact time I got the email closing my Coinbase account this morning at 11am et

@ 10k/btc?

I’m down 30% from a couple weeks ago too, but in this market that can literally change overnight. Your losses are only realized when you click sell

Lol you should have only tried to make the order once

I wouldn’t sell BEFORE speaking to an advisor. I think you’d be an idiot to do anything rash without waiting a week or 2. Do yourself a favor and lock your computer In a safe for about a month before your ruin your life and then have to live with the regret when you see btc rebound a week from now after you sell for a 30k loss lol chill out bro, it can’t get too much worse from here can it really?
