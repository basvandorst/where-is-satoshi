There exists a number between 1 and 10. Depending on your needs and use cases you can select your own number of open channels.
You dont have to reach your destination in 6 hops. Depending on use and cost you can possibly accept many more hops than that. If you are making many payments, making many hops too expensive, then you can open a new channel to offset the variable cost with a new fixed setup cost.

Just remember to reevaluate your position if those 20% gain enough to suddenly be 60-80 percent of your savings.

It is that investment that paid off.

Proving you control a utxo without revealing the private key would be done by signing a challenge message with your key. 
The main weakness to that scheme is if the true owner is willing to pass along messages while knowing that cheats some third party. (The actual challenge needs to contain some specific fact that the true owner would recognize.)

Ethereum did not have a bug. It patched a retroactive consensus fix because of a bug on a contract on it's network.  Its not the same. 
In this case the bug would be obvious avd much less contentious to fix.  Everyone would agree that there was something wrong and the only issue would be what to do with the implications of the chaos ensuing reorg.

My take on an answerto this question is that your balance would be the sum of a series of payments. Each of those payments come from different individuals. To validate that sum you need to validate all the payments and payments are validated by checking that their payment is signed with a key that belongs to the payer (not to mention that you need to validate how that payer got his payments as well).
If you exchanged the transaction ledger with a list of sums then each list of sums would need a list of proofs (signatures) for each payment made to it, effectively putting you right back to where to started.
@_date: 2014-05-14 08:08:01

Why do we need the intermidiate key when handling bip 38 passphrase encrypted private keys? I am supposed to use my passphrase to encrypt an intermediate phrase, send that to a vendor, they use that to generate an encrypted key and send that back to me (usually printed one something pretty). Only my original passphrase will allow me to use that key.
My question is simple, but it annoys me that I can't see it: Why can't I just create the full bip38 pass phrase encrypted private key myself and send that to them without the whole intermediate code?

It is also valid if bitcoin adoption becomes widespread enough to make holding bitcoin a valid choice for most people even if they hold other curencies as well. For instance holding all of it in one bank account or wallet provider that automatically does conversions for them.
Or simply by raising the liquidity by adding more users and volume which will reduce the spread and friction of converting.

Anyone holding bitcoin and paying with bitcoin knows the risk of the fluctuation in the market. You only need to tell them that if they claim a return then the dollar value of the item will be returned to them in dollars and not bitcoin.

There will probably be as many answers here as there are replies, but this is the most important property in my opinion:
Bitcoin may seem unnecessary to you, you may feel that your needs are taken care of todays solutions, but there are about five billion unbanked or underbanked people on this planet. Visa and traditional financial institutions are unable or unwilling to provided these people with proper banking or financial tools because of cost and profitability. That is becaues they operate on an old and unsustainable technology platform that historically has required a ton of regulation to keep secure and has gotten additional regulation added to it to keep entrepeneurs and challengers from entering and innovating the system.
Bitcoin turns all that on its head and provides a cheap, affordable and scalable financial system that knows no borders, is not hampered by politicians or lobbyist looking out for number one, is free from censorship, cant be confiscated and can easily be secured by anyone at any time in any place.
(In the future, I mean, I don't pretend to believe that we are there yet, there are still kinks to work out.)

The confirmation target window is set to 10 minutes because it is a good middle ground between fast confirmations and low orphan rates*.
Reducing the confirmation target window is also not really important and good analysis of the current pending transcations across several nodes and the transaction in question will let you know with a very high certainty if something will get accepted.
*orphans are what happens when two miners find different correct solutions to a block within a small period of time and the network has to chose which one to go with. This causes lost income to the miner that loses and can cause forks.

You have to peg your prices in one unit of account. If that happens to be dollars then no matter how people pay that amount that is still the way and the value that you put on that item.
As long as am item is pegged to dollar then anyone paying in anything else will have to take the risk of fluctuation.

I believe we are slightly outside the scope of the original topic here. By invisible taxes I presume you mean the inflation of fiat currency, but our educational systems in my country are paid for by the government and wether or not that is from the invisible tax or from the transaparent and very visible tax is beside the point.
Simply put our governement collects taxes from the whole of the population and helps young people to get an education and then expect their later taxes to pay back said expense whilst continuing to fund the coming student youths. This gives us: 
(1) equal rights and possibility for education across wealth and class, and 
(2) an even distribution of the burdon of educational cost instead of a young indebted work force.
For the record my country is Norway, but a similar system is in place across the entire Scandinavia. 
(PS. We also have available to us student loans at very good interest rates and terms to provide for living expenses while studying.)

If there was no previous trust relationship between buyer and seller than an escrow would still be necessary.
Those four weeks might have been reduced to two weeks while waiting for the item to ship, but you won't get your money instantly if you want to have customers. The escrow should not release the funds to you until the customer has received the item.
However, in a few years, I expect that escrow service will be a lot cheaper, like 0.5%, or less cheaper.

Storage will not change, but over the next 127ish years the reward that miners get from newly minted coins will be reduced.
As that amount is reduced the transaction fees of the users will have to compensate by paying more or having more transactions that pay. 
The equillibrium is a low enough transaction cost that it's cheap to use while the miners are compensated well enough that it pays for a powerful enough mining network that it is secure from hostile take-over.

I believe most of the laws writte by these "strangers" are for the betterment of mankind. I believe willingly breaking those laws is something that should be done sparingly with the full understanding that one might get punished for it. If it's important enough to  you then you do it anyway.
I also believe that there are often better ways to change things than to go all 'military style us against them lets burn them all to the ground' on the world.
I want bitcoin to succeed because of the tremendous amount of good it can do to the world particularly in helping change inequality in the world and removing power from those that grip it today.
But to do so I believe we have to be smart, and using bitcoin to launder drug money is not the smart way of gaing about it.

If they receive payment too late they need to cancel the order. 
The best way for them to handle the situation afterwards is through customer support. 
And they really have no case saying that you need to take it up with the vendor. If they received the funds outside the time frame they should not have honored their deal with the vendor and sent them that money. This is their problem. They need to handle it.

You really need to read the implementatino code to get your answer to all of this.
But what's important is that what people changed in the transaction did not in any way change how much the transaction paid, or from who, to whom. Only changed unimportant stuff like the ordering of the information. The hash of that transaction was never meant to be used as a unique ID. 
It was all a misunderstanding and an erroneous implementation.

You probably need to work on your presentation. Just asking out in class doesn't sound like a great idea. Though I might not have gotten the whole story.
Additionaly, you should simultaniously provide them a scenario in which to spend the coin they get. Show them a vendor nearby or a website where their money will get them something. Alternatively show them the public address of a few known charities that accept it. 
Accepting $5 and passing it on to a charity is a great way to first test out bitcoin.

I believe you are sort of contradicting yourself.
My whole problem is that while I don't know if gigahash is a cooperative player or not I need to constantly watch what they are doing. In the original distributed system I did not have to worry about the players cooperating or working selfishly, it didn't matter.
If and when GHash/Cex gets more than 50% of the hashing power (not just 50% of the blocks in a given time frame) they will be able to do somereally hurtful things to the ecosystem. Some of them to the detriment of their own income, but I can't know that they are rational. I can't know they won't be co-opted by another player to work against their best interest. &lt;tinfoil&gt; I can't know that they aren't an anti-bitcoin organization, building a computing farm that turns a profit until the day they are large enough to tank the whole system.&lt;/tinfoil&gt;.

If you expect it to rise in the future it should be easy to find someone to accept it. The deflationary nature is a positive thing for the person who owns it and wants to spend it.
Wether it is healthy for the macroeconomic climate or not is a different matter. It might be more difficult for shops to get people to spend their bitcoin when they know it will be valued higher over time.
Again it is a political and philosophical question wether this is a good thing and if it will ever impact the economy; all I can say is I feel the question is too difficult for me to answer and it's anyones guess how the worlds economy would adapt to a purely deflationary monetary system.

But, yes, if you want to participate in the network then you will need some serious hardware in the future if bitcoin becomes the world leading transaction system. This is hardly surprising.

I do however have to apply VAT if I'm selling sausages at a market as a registered business, but the person buying with bitcoin is not a registered bitcoin seller he is just a private person paying for a service with a non-standard currency. No VAT added on the bitcoin, only on the goods.
However if I started a business that sold bitcoin for NOK then I would have to charge and apply VAT to all sales under current norwegian legislation.

Most people won't understand how Bitcoin works any more than they understand how computers or the internet works.
But that's ok, we only need enough developers and investors to understand how it works so that they can produce applications and services that work better and cheaper than in the legacy payment space. Or are uniquely available to it.
**People** won't care that Bitcoin has better fundamentals or that it's decentralized. Most people won't care about being freem from government control or censorship. They will only care when new applications will be built that weren't possible to build before.

Your argument is flawed. If you assume he wants to cash out to help some charity or the world at large you are forgetting one very important thing.
By the time bitcoin were valuable enough for his stash to change the world, the world would be dependant upon bitcoin. And cashing out would in effect cause a massive inflation. That inflation and subsequent panic would likely shatter the economy and perhaps the world as it were.

I'm torn between downvoting you for factual error and upvoting you for posting a genuine question; i'll just leave it alone and correct you.
All blocks will never be mined. There will always be a new block after the next one. And the next one, until all miners have been shut down.
The amount of newly minted bitcoin injected into the ecosystem in every block through what is called the 'coinbase' however, that will be gradually reduced until 21 million bitcoin have been minted. 
What will hopefully happen as the newly minted coins get less important as an incetive for the miners is that the amount of transactions increases and the transaction fees are enough to pay for the security that the miners provide.
@_date: 2014-02-17 12:07:20
All transactions in the network (the blockchain) are public knowledge and visible, regardless of where you store your private key.
I believe what people mean when they say you can stay anonymous is that no one knows that a certain address is yours. If you buy bitcoin at an exchange that has your personal information, it would be possible to connect those bitcoin to your name. Likewise if you cash out through an exchange the same would be possible.
To stay anonymous you would need to get the bitcoin from someone that can't connect it to you identity (say from someone over the internet for doing some task or other), and spend it on something that can't be directly linked to you.
The addresses and bitcoin is pseudonymous, no one can know who that pseudonym belongs to until you give them the means to.
PS. This is also why you are recommended to not use a single address for all your needs, but use seperate addresses for different payments and manage your change accounts.

There are countless examples of why and where financial privacy is wanted, the question is wether we want that privacy secured through a decentralized system or a centralized control.
You could easily implement a payment processor in bitcoin that takes you money and handles the transaction to t he recipient. With a delay or with another currency. This would work perfectly if it had a large and varied enough volume, the average person would not be able to figure out what  you bought. This is the same as a credit card company or paypal for instance.
This company could then be subpoenaed by the government to hand over records of what it was you bough should it need it in the end. (Or blatantly steal all that information and monitor everyone.)
This is of course what the government wants, but its not what we want.
I think the question that remains is can we create, and should the government allow us to create a decentralized system that anonymizes the payments without a backdoor that lets law enforcement track your financial movements. I want that, but if you want to appease the government, how do you argue for it.

The market value will be the market value no matter how you obtain it. The cost of mining bitcoin will approach the cost of purchasing it. This is the laws of economics.
I also don't like your idea of chosing a group of people and giving free coins to this in-crowd on satoshis say-so. I would have been much less inclined to care about bitcoin if I knew a group of people had been simply given a bunch of them.
The beauty of the coinbase and the halving is that as bitcoin proves itself and becomes more popular/valuable obtaining new ones becomes much harder. In other words, it was only easy earlier because it was a gamble that would probably turn out worthless anyway.

**This makes no sense to me.**
If you are withholding the block you found, that isn't preventing anyone else from finding the exact same block the next second. 
If you withhold the block you found then chances are some other block finds it first (about 1-hashofpool chance) and you dont get paid.
How would this be better than simply joining another pool, the pool you left gets less hashing power and the pool you joined gets more. This is more effective than pretending to mine for a pool and only taking shares without turning in blocks.

It would be in the miners best interenst to not include your fee-less transaction, hoping to retransmit with a fee. =&gt; They are incentivized to only include transactions with fee.
You ask why they won't skip small fees as well hoping you send larger fees? They might, but the market powers will decide which fees are large enough when other miners include the fees you deemed to low.

I see that you allready have gotten a few requests for a card design without the hologram. Keeping the private key (bip38) visible. I too would prefer a design such as this. I would chose a strong password and accept every risk of it being photographed and brute forced.
In addition I would prefer the back side of the card to have a slicker design. Your current back side is informative and nice, but since is for my personal use I would prefer something that looks good and presentable. 
(Basically I want your card to be able to show the address to receive payment and also to be able to import my private key whenever my phone or similar is unavailable or out of power.)

Multi-sig escrow service with you, your driver and Uber being the three parties (2/3). You scan a code and broadcast a transaction when you get into the cab. Uber would only get involved if you or your driver were unsatisfied.
This could be a upper bounds amount if you want, so that when you reach your destination and if you are happy with the requested payment you approve the charge and the driver gets his money, Uber gets their share and the rest is deposited back to you.
This could be handled automatically and as long as the money is deposited to the escrow account you don't need to settle everything right away. They could wait until you have reported your trip and written a review for instance, or disputed the charge if there were any problems.
The only problem is that you would have to broadcast that transaction at the start of the trip, but it would remove the requirement of giving Uber your cc information and allowing them to claim whatever charges they want (, if you are afraid of that sort of thing).

First of all, which investors are we scaring? If we suffered a 51% attack then trust in bitcoin and the value would fall, yes, but that does not really have anything to do with any investors. Investors of what?
Remember that controlling 51% of the hashing power does not allow you to do anything too funky. No spending of bitcoin you don't have the key to and no arbitrary deleting of others bitcoin or sudden creation of your own bitcoin.
What you can do if you control over 50% of the hashing power is to reconstruct the block chain. Rewrite history as it were; the further back you go the more time and resources it will cost you. As well as chose which transactions are accepted into the block chain.
**Controlling over 50% of the hashing power allows you to do primarily two things:**
-Decide which transactions appear in the block chain, effectively sensoring and blocking others from making transactions.
-Make a payment to someone, allow as many confirmations to occur as that person requires until he gives you what you paid for, then roll back to before you made the payment and send that money somewhere else (yourself).
**However, please bear in mind**, acquiring, operating and planning such an attack is prohibitively expensive. Only a very powerful and rich actor could afford to do so, it would not make sense to do so only for defrauding someone for a few million dollars. Also performing this action would most likely destroy confidence in bitcoin, causing its value to plummet. Hence destroying the value of the infrastructure acquired to perform the attack and making it necessary to offload all those defrauded coins somewhere before the market responds too much.
*I am very curious how feasible it would be to surreptitiously hold 51% of the hashing power and continuously perform small double spend attacks or small sensorship acts without drawing attention to how it happened. Anyone have any thoughts?*

You call it an IPO, where anyone can buy in with other money, and get bitcoin early or late, depending upon if they want to take a risk or not.

This is so counterproductive for most people. If you make them create unique passwords for every site they will just start writing them down or forgetting them.
His scheme is perfectly valid, allthough I myself up the ante to 4-5 different passwords.
Also using password managers are not a valid idea for everyone, you really need to understand how they work to be able to decide if you want a cloud based one or a local stash and how you would back that up.
Edit: I have used password managers before and I have created superrandom passwords where so necessary. I just don't think its productive to tell every person to only ever do this. Security is always a compromise between saftey and convenience.

Apparently they are using something from a company called BitWall, anyone heard of that before?
Their idea seems good, but the technical implementatino is seriously lacking.
It should be able to discover payments on the network to the address so I don't have to press confirm to check.
(Also its not really a paywall since you can click confirm anyway and get passed it without paying, but thats another matter of the paper not wanting to actually enforce a paywall.)
Edit: Yeah, and its not using single use addresses for every transaction. Someone should be able to make this product heaps better.

There are many things you could do while controlling 51%. Read anny other post around here. My point is that it's not necessarily the person currently controlling the pool that is the problem. But that someone else might force him to. Or exploit some weakness curtesy of the NSA to take over control.
(For one they can premine blocks to counter transaction by causing fork. Double spending even with 6+ confirmations. Or simply cause multiple forks that would totally tank the whole network because they just wanted to destroy bitcoin)

It is immune to inflation which is a real concern, at least to some.
One choice would be to buy something like gold which is also immune to inflation, but bitcoins advantage is in its ability to be both a good store of value (immune to inflation) and being a valid and spendable currency (arguably more spendable than fiat currency with credit cards over the internet *once it reaches maturity*)

Sorry no link, but this isn't bitcoin specific. This is a general rule and bitcoin has been thrown in with everything else. [The wikipedia page]( states minimum threshold of 750kNOK and 0,7+0,4 percent. But that is 750kNOK total after deducting debts, and remember that real estate in norway has a taxation value of about one third of its market value.
As for buying from justcoin, yes that is their (and my) interpretation, but I can't be 100% certain. Their statement is that they are not selling bitcoin they are only facilitating the sale by connecting sellers and buyrs. I believe they pay VAT on the transaction; fee that is their service and income.
Finally, yes, the moment you sell, or 'trade you bitcoin for a product' you have realised the value of your investment and you owe taxes on the amount your bitcoin appreciated in value.

Supply will go down so price may go up.
However if it doesn't and volume/transaction fees don't increase substantially then ASICs will be turned off en masse and the hash rate and security will plummet. Also the time between blocks will temporarily sky rocket. We will see a major crisis of confidence from which we may not recover.
However I believe we will probably be in a healthy growth period before that.

That would be correct if I opened a shop and sold bitcoin over the counter, I would have to apply VAT to my 'electronic service'. But if I'm a private person exchanges my bitcoin for a product I don't pay VAT.
Same as if you buy a used bike from a private person.
Edit to clarify: The way I interpret that ruling by skattemyndighetene is that it distinguishes bitcoin from other currencies in that an exchange business would be impossible to run. If Forex or WU started trading bitcoin they would have to apply 25% VAT on all sales of bitcoin making it impossible to make a profit. But you don't apply VAT to sales between private parties.

Full nodes and power users will still scale linearly which will have to be good enough for now. (It probably is as well).
The important part here is that the block size cost for miners is bounded by O(1). Meaning miners are incentivized to include more transactions to get more fees.
General storage and bandwidth is cheap(ish), orphaning a block due to slow propagation is not chep.
@_date: 2014-01-22 12:31:13
Capitalization? 
@_date: 2014-08-28 17:06:24
Except transaction throughout isn't linked to hashing power. Only bandwidth and storage space.
Adding more transactions will not require or incentivize more hashing power. (Yet, and until transaction fees become a significant part of block rewards.

Nope. They don't think that the price of bitcoin will increase in the future. They understand that bitcoin is a valid and secure transaction system with which they accept payment.
That has nothing to do with their belief in the increase value of bitcoin. In fact in the short term it might even make it decrease. It is however a medium large vote of confidence in the legeitimacy of the currency, just as any merchant or service accepting it is.

Not everyone are the same. Not everyone have the same preferences.
Not everyone wants to be their own bank, some prefer paying someone else to help them do it. And no matter how much you tell them that it's perfectly safe to do it yourself and that they are losing money by chsoing that option they will continue to put their money in the bank.

You can disagree with the law as much as you want, but if you break it you are going to go to jail.
What Shrem did was fantastically stupid, it seems he knowingly broke the law and did an extremely poor job at hiding it. Innocent until proven guilty of course, but defending his right to break the law just 'because bitcoin' only harms bitcoin in the long run.

To get 3FA you would need to be tested on something you ARE. (Biometrics most likely.)

His only argument was against "reusable addresses". I agree with him that that's not a great name.
His argument that its ingrained in the public allready is an aweful argument. It is far from mainstream yet, there is plenty of time to rename it.
By his own words 'incognito' could be used, that would be a hell of a lot better than 'stealth'. Stealth applies sinister or surreptitious connotations. That is not a healthy path to start down if you want main stream adoptation. Incognito would be better, or some other. I'm not saying I have the answers, but 'stealth' looks pretty bad to me.

I don't disagree with what you just wrote, but your description of their process for getting feedback and consensus wouldn't be thrown out the window just because you decided you had to do a hard fork. Proposing a hard fork that never achieves its activation threshold hasn't hurt anyone. And anyone can propose a hard fork regardless of existing power structures, just like with a soft fork. The means of proposing, discussing and agreeing on a change aren't **necessarily** different in the two scenarios.
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:33:49
There really isn't any one true answer here, it depends on what you think the minimum transaction fee should be. 
One way of looking at it is that the transaction volume stopped growing beucase the blocks became full; that there is lots of use cases out there that would love to produce more transactions, but that does not deem it economical to do so. They might abandon their projects or look for alterntives. 
But again the question we must ask ourselves is what is the minumum price someone should be expected to pay to get a transaction included in a block, and the community is greatly divided on that very question.

To me it is worth it, at least worth discussing, but I apreciate your answers.
Holding out for the future changes down the line is also an interesting thought which I will keep in mind. However given the complexity of performing hard forks I wonder if its not better going with smaller updates and agreeing on routines and thresholds for doing it, rather than risking it all on one big future upgrade.
At least we are finally discussing what I felt was lacking in this debate, whether or not a hard fork is worth the benefits of performing one instead of declaring that there is no such benefit.

A great read and an excellent approach. 
However, while you do state that holding bitcoin for only 15 minutes is a conservative estimate, I think it is conservative to the point of erroneous. 
The typical remittance case involves sending money across large distances and often to different time zones. Often to recipients without modern communication tools. The recipients will be visiting a bitcoin remittance office to redeem the coins into local currency on a given date that has been pre-determined. The sender will make sure that the coin is there by that date and there will likely not be any communication except to confirm receipt after the fact.
I believe it is more likely that you will see a 6 to 12 hour holding period after the bitcoin have been bought and sent before they are redeemed by the recipient, over night transfers or early transfers for fear of missing the appointed time. Your fifteen minutes is extremely conservative in my opinion.
Thats all. Otherwise a great read.

The words you quoted from me say the complete opposite of what you claim they say.
There is plenty of additional technical debt born by implementing it as a soft fork. That isn't the question. 
People should be focusing on whether the qualities of the superior technical solution outweighs the costs and risks of chosing it. Instead I'm mostly hearing arguments that the two solutions are equal when they are clearly not.
Your argument that I keep repeating the same thing regardless of proof is pretty ironic when that was exactly what you did. I'd like for you to explain to me how a solution that is more expensive to maintain and develop and is more prone to errors does not have more technical debt.

@_date: 2014-08-28 15:23:27
This is of course a very complicated issue and my answers will be overly simplified, but here goes:
Creating a politically neutral, globally accessible and programmably extensible form of currency/payment network has a lot of value to humanity going forward. It is however difficult.
As the Bitcoin network stands today it is neither widespread enough, usable enough or easy enough to reach global penetration, but as its usage increases and utility grows those problems with ecomonic and environmental cost will hopefully scale properly.
What I'm saying is this: Current prices, hashing power and hashing farms have grown faster than adoption, mostly because of speculation that Bitcoin adoption will increase in the future. As we find Bitcoins true market position in the future we will also find the correct equillibrium of value, network size and network security.
Your home built solution would not scale the way we hope that Bitcoin will.

It's not just aesthethics though. It's a technical issue of simplicity; and the maintenance of something I hope will last for thousands of years.
If every time we want to change or fix something in the protocol we do it in the quickest way that leaves us with a suboptimal solution including technical debt then the protocol will become harder and harder to upgrade and maintain. 
The technical debt in this case is the additional complexity of understanding the data structure which will make any future bitcoin software more prone to errors and more expensive to develop.
If ever we are to have the time to do this right, I don't think it's in 10 years when if we are lucky we are the primary currency or payment rail on the planet. People argue that we can't take chances with a protocol with a market cap of $15 billion. But surely it's better to do it properly now than to push that complexity and risk ahead of us to a time when the market cap is $100 or $1000 billion? 
At least that is my belief.

A hard fork in and of itself is not better than a soft fork, but the solution available to us through a hard fork in this case provides the better long time strategy.
If you don't think that the solution open to us through a hard fork is better than the other one then I would love to hear the arguments. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows.

You shouldn't* be reusing passwords across different sites anyway. And if someone sniffed your client-side hashed password they can use that hashed password same as if they sniffed a non-hashed password.
Hashing a password client side adds very little security and more often than not is a sign that someone has misunderstood the reasoning behind hashing them.

I've been away, so I apologize that this reply is late:
I am in no way advocating a hard fork without the proper discussion and activation period. If we are ~~quiting~~ quoting satoshi I'll point to his post here 
 proposing to put the rule in with a condition regarding the blocknumber being higher than some constant. That is a form of activation period and I'm not advocating any more risky or less thought out hard fork.
In fact I wasn't really advocating a hard fork at all, I took offense that the original post tried to claim that there was absolutely no difference between the two data structures worth discsussing.

Your analogy doesn't hold water in this case, because the two boxes aren't the same.
One is sitting on your desk with a label explaining what it is, the other is behind the shed in the garden, dug down into the flower bed with a note taped to the shed explaining how many steps to your right you need to walk before digging. 
The problem for instance is what do you do with that box if you need to move. Or if you tear down the shed or move the shed. Or plant a tree in the path between the shed and the dug down box?
Or to dispense with the nonsense: putting the witness in one field in the data structure is simpler, cleaner and more easily handled by future upgrades than putting it in the other more deeply buried, less natural, spot in the data structure. 
Remember the proposal isn't just to put it further down the tree of transactions. It is literally buried in the scripPubKey describing the rules for how to spend one of the outputs from the coinbase transaction. With the rules for figuring out which one of the outputs depend on a pattern matching looking for a specific byte-pattern in an OP_Return.

I agree the picture showed the difference in a simple and easy to understand way, there is nothing wrong with that. But the world isn't always that simple. Understanding that picture doesn't mean you understand the underlying difference between the two solutions.
Just because the picture didn't show a difference that everybody saw doesn't mean that the difference isn't there. That is the danger on the other side of the coin that is simplification.
Regarding hard forks, I well understand the dangers. I'm not advocating going out guns blazing and hard forking now, but coming to consensus and taking the time to agree and then hard forking is worth the wait and the effort. Doing this in a soft fork has its own risks and you can split the network just as easily with a contentios soft fork.


Also I'd appreciate a little less of the hyperbole; explain to me your difference of opinion, and surely we can come to understand eachother.

A soft fork has the potential for those who don't upgrade to not recognize that they need to upgrade and may fall victim to an attack where someone takes advantage of their lacking understanding of the current rules.
A hard fork forces everyone to realize they have to upgrade if they havent already during the activation period.
The first one is only as dangerous as the potential attack one can make against ignorant nodes, miners and wallets, but it is not nonexistant.
Also I'm not saying a hard fork isn't difficult and dangerous, but you keep insisting that soft forks don't have any risk or cost. Repeating it even when I try to give examples to explain it.

To get a vanity address you generate millions of private keys and deduct their public addresses. You then scan those addresses for strings that you want to have in your public key, continue until you find one you like.

Low volatility is not an absolute requirement. It is an extremely beneficial property of a currency, but not an absolute requirements. 
There are many contemporary expamples of currencies with high volatility that work and there are many historical examples of currencies that were very volatile over long periods of time against neighboring states and comparative to competing currencies/commodities.
While low volatility is an important property it is not the only important property of a currency. Fungibility, storability, transportability, divisibility, transaction friction, counterfeit-proof, and now, programmability. These are all important properties of a good currency, stability is only one amongst many.

Don't put words into my mouth please. Drugs is an increadible vast and difficult topic, to claim that no production or sale of drugs is harmful is incredibly naive. Which drugs, and in what circumstances those drugs, are harmful is not black and white. The production and sale of drugs is usually motivated by greed and the opportunity that addiction provides to take money from weak and sick.
This, in many cases, is preying upon and profiting from the misery of the weak. I do not see this as a morally defensible thing. It is however a dificult grey area and I am not saying that all drugs are evil.
You may also believe that governments are evil and taxes are robbery. I do not believe so, but I do believe the government needs oversight and I don't automatically agree with their decisions. I enjoy the stability of a working government, with taxes that pay for health care, firemen and police. 
I do not believe that the government should be able to spy upon and monitor its citizens indiscriminately, but I would prefer transparancy in the workings of our financial institutions. Most of all I believe money laundering is wrong because it bypasses the system set up to redistribute wealth in the form of taxes that help pay for the system I enjoy being apart of.
Lastly, you are wrong. There are more than two possibilities. Guilt is not, as you say, a question of having performed a morally objectional action. Guilt has two meanings and *can* be that of moral guilt. It does, however, also have the meaning of being guilty against a penal law as stated by the legislative government of the jurisdiction in question. Disagree with that law all you will, it will not make you less guilty in the eyes of the law. And the word guilt is two-fold. You do not have the right to remove one of those meanings and force the other onto me.

It's a clever solution, I agree. But I simply don't agree it is better.
Please also recognize I'm not advocating for a contentious hard fork. I'm merely suggesting that a soft fork has it's own technical problems and segwit is such a big upgrade that it's unfortunate if it happens in a way that those that haven't yet or chose not to upgrade will view any segwit transaction as an anyone can pay transaction.
If a miner keeps mining without understand the segwit upgrade then that miner will put their blocks on a seperate chain. A softfork simply means that nodes and wallets can continue without upgrading and they just wont know about the new magical stuff. A miner will need to upgrade anyway to be competitive; or they will fork onto a new chain with other miners that dont agree or understand the new protocol.

I disagree; the advantage bitcoin has over cc technology is that the payments are pushed from your device without revealing the underlying key instead of effectively giving out your key and waiting for the recipient to pull what he wants from your account.
Securing my own device is much more approachable than relying on every recipient of payment being able to secure the keys they receive.

Some things are better to deploy as a soft fork. A soft fork means not everyone has to  upgrade to understand whats going on. But they will have to upgrade to understand the new feature or else interpret segwit transactions as anyone can spend transactions.
It is simply my belief that segwit is too large and too complext a change to perform as a soft fork, and that performing it as a hard form allows us to do it more smoothly and more elegantly.

None of the other crypto currencies using anything other than PoW actually works yet, I'm doubtful they will. 51% PoW is democratisaztion of the chain.
You state deflationary = bad for currency as an axiom without needing proof because conventional wisdom dictates that it is. Conventional wisdom, however, is often wrong. I don't know if a deflationary currency is going to work, but neither side of this arguemnt *knows* for a fact and can prove beyond doubt that they are wrong.
I don't agree that transaction times are a problem, if you mean transaction propagation speed. I certaintly don't believe in shorteing the block-solving time target. Storage space for the blocks and the block chain is not a big problem and it will be prunable. Block size for propagation and mine bandwitdth are being worked on as we speak. See Gavin's two latest posts on propagation infrastructure and IBLT respectively. 
The biggest problem with new cryptocurrencies is that none of them will be able to convince everyone else of switching to them. They are basically exciting test beds, but they will never work on a large scale.
Those are, at least, my opinions.

A hard fork is comlex. It is difficult and it can be dangerous. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. You aim for a high approval rate and you take the time to get everyone to agree.
If we are to try to make Bitcoin the future of money then we will without a doubt have to hard fork at some point. We might as well do it now when we have a good reason for one, learn from the experience and get a better and simpler product out of it at the same time.

I don't get this post. To me the data structure to the right is clearly the superior one. Chosing the optimal data structure should be a priority and in this case that would be the one you could only get if you were willing to do a hard fork.
EDIT FOR UPDATE: Since alot of people are commenting and asking for a clarification, I'll try to give one very briefly:
Quoting the bip 141: _The commitment is recorded in a scriptPubKey of the coinbase transaction. It must be at least 38 bytes, with the first 6-byte of 0x6a24aa21a9ed, that is: ......._ 
Where the commitment is the double sha256-hash of the merke root of the witnesses.
The original data structure leaves the witness structure as a seperate node under the block header where it is easy to see and easy to deal with. The soft fork hack moves it to an otherwise meaningless or ambigiuos data field in the coinbase transaction. This is an ugly hack that requires more custom code and handling than the original proposal.
I'd *much* rather take a bit more up-front cost right now in performing a hard fork than making a smart hack than increases the complexity of the data structure and all code that wants to understand it for perpetuity.
Note that the bip also comments on this saying _The witness is committed in a tree that is nested into the block's existing merkle root via the coinbase transaction for the purpose of making this BIP soft fork compatible. **A future hard fork can place this tree in its own branch.**_
I would prefer to do it properly the first time.
**TLDR**; the comment that this post is referring to makes it sound as if the two cases are equal and everyone should just stfu, when in short the right data structure is clearly superior, but has a higher up front cost.
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:14:20
For one the setup with the mnemonic is not explained well enough for beginners. The difference between that and the watch-only seems intuitive, but when using it across to platforms (desktop and android) at the same time the setup turned rather confusing.
The opening screen is also unintuitive. Showing me my transaction history and graph when it's clear I don't have any history yet doesn't make much sense. I'd rather see a welcome splash with options for funding the wallet (sweeping private keys or address to end to for instance).
EDIT: Annoying thing on android: After having imported the mnemonic and just entering the pin on subsequent logins the "next" button on the keyboard moves the cursor to the mnemonic text field instead of effectively clicking the 'login' button. Also I'd prefer having a wider range of pass phrase options rather than only a 4-digit pin.
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:27:23
I was tired and there were typos.
But if segwit becomes a success then hopefully every transaction from then on is done as a segwit transaction. And every node that does not upgrade will only see transactions as ones that anyone can spend because they wont understand or even look for the actual redeem scripts. That is a clear danger to the owners of those nodes and makes segwit a change that I'd rather see everyone accept as a hardfork instead.

But there will never be more than 21 million of any one of them.

Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin.
You say there cant be consensus in a fork or feature without the developers of Bitcoin Core agreeing, I say we don't need consensus amongst those five people because I don't recognize their authority. 
I respect the work they have done and accept their wisdom in most things, but when a substantial amount of people disagree with Bitcoin Core then the natural way of opposing them is to fork the code. Create an alternative and **discuss** those changes.
Censoring discussion of that software fork is to deny the community the chance to disagree with Bitcoin Core.

I only suppot XT because I lack an alternative.
We have known for a long long time that this day would come, that blocks would fill. And it's been urgent for six months. In those last six months only Gavin and Mike have actively worked on this issue and communicated their work.
If Core adopted a different, but sufficient patch I would accept that. I see XT as a way of telling the Core developers how much we want this change.
Adopt one of the other proposed changes, witha smaller increase if you want. I'd prefer an increase to 2MB with a voting schedule for further increases, but at least give us something.
Give us an alterntive to XT or XT will surely eradicate Core.
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:35:42
It's  a VERY different task than this bip or the block size in general.  Everyone agrees that the 32 mb limit needs to be fixed.  It's more of a bug than a feature tbh.

The BIP 100 is a great proposal, at least as a starting ground for discussion.
But I still haven't seen an adequate explanation of this sentence, I have no idea what this means:


“/BV8000000/” to vote for 8M. Votes are evaluated by **dropping bottom 20% and top
20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen.**

If we assume that their cost of operations is constant, and that they get X% of the hashing power to collude, and split the cost of Y bitcoin for the spam transactions proportional to the hashing power of all colluding parties:
They would be spending Y * (1 - X) bitcoin on the attck and the increased amount fees of all other actors (Z) during the attack would have to be more than this:
**Z &gt;= Y * (1-X)**
Now someone else go look at the increase in fees during attacks, number and cost of spam transactions and make estimates on how large of the hashing pool could possibly be colluding and solve this ting.

Hi there.   
  
Always great to read updates on your operations. I really like your angle on the bitcoin markets.  
  
I do however always wonder how you offload the bitcoin you receive. Since your rebittance branch is so much larger than your other brands and the flow of bitcoin is heavily one-directional. How do you sell bitcoin without creating market imbalances in your local markets? Or how do you manage to do proper arbitrage in the markets you operate? Do you have extensive partners helping you move fiat through traditional channels at cheap prices or are you simply absorbung the bitcoin and eating capital?  
  
Thanks for what you are doing.
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:18:57

I generally agree with Gavins sentiment here, but his dismissal of Metcalfes law is very lacking.
Without offering any proof he insists that the number of transactions in the network will increase by O(n). His anecdotal evidence is that it's silly to think that everyone will transact to everyone and that he himself has only transacted with maybe 100 other actors.
In my view the burden of proof is on the person saying Metcalfes law does not apply, and in my opinion it seems fairly obvious that you won't be able to disprove that: The more users there are of btcoin the more use cases there are. I believe that the more users I meet that use bitcoin the more transactions I will make. 
Essentially, the more bitcoin users there are the more every user will use bitcoin. That is O(n^2) growth. And its what we want.

Credit cards and paypal arent really a good example here, but lets take payment processor visa as the example:
What you gain by using dollars in circle which uses bitcoin as its rails is the much lower fees, the much faster confirmation times and consequently no fear of chargebacks.
If you tried to do the same with visa you would never really know which money are confirmed transferred and which are not. If you tried to use it for handling payments for goods you sold or bought on craigs list or whatever people use in the US then you would get a huge percentage of fraud.
Building this on bitcoin allows people to perform the same actions, but do them quicker and with more security than before.

When Hal Finney said this we still had not seen half of what we have created to improve bitcoin. He may have been right, but his points are outdated. The fact is that we may actually be able to pull off a full world economy on-chain using various techniques that are still under development. First case in point, the potential of Lightning Network to facilitate micro-to-small payments that still settle on-chain without a centralised actor. And more recently Bitcoin-NG.

I haven't read the paper yet, but I listened to their interview on ltb. One thing I never got an answer to and maybe you can help: When, if ever, are the micro blocks anchored back onto a key block? Are the micro blocks ever hashed into a key block to determine which micro blocks were atually observed by the network? It can't be the next key block, but could perhaps be n+2, but the key block header would get a pretty strange structure.
Do you have any idea?

The dificulty is knowing how important a given inveatment is for them. Without knowing their wealth level its hard to know if $1000 is their life savings or pocket change.
If the bitcoin you own is play money then using an online wallet is fine for a while. While you play with it. 
But if you have a substantial amount of your wealth in bitcoin you should take your time to understand how to properly secure it. Preferably the other way around. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 11:32:49

That explanation is a bit simplified. The question he poses is "if you borrow the worlds only dollar and promise to pay it back with interest, how can you pay back more money than exists?"
The answer is that you pay back the first dollar first, and then you work or trade to earn back the rest you owe and then you pay it. You can easily create a debt larger than the total supply.
It's still a fucked up system, but this explanation does not hold water.

They addressed this in their interview on LTB podcast. Primarily they argued that it is the key that wins the key block and that key can be distributed. You could have several clones of your software holding that key and signing transactions once you win the key block.

If you are the current emperor of mining because you found the previous key block, then you are currently signing and releasing microblocks. Your first microblock points to your key block and subsequent micro blocks point to the previous micro block. Right?
The moment I see your key block I update my miners and start trying to mine a new key block referencing your key block, I can't and won't pay attention to all your micro blocks while I do this. When I find a new key block, say after ten minutes, I become the new emperor of micro blocks and I start issuing micro blocks that refer my key block that I just released. 
So in my scenario we have a chain of key blocks and each key block  is the root block of a series of micro blocks, but at no point do these micro blocks get hashed back onto the key block chain. What am I not understanding?
I guess I should explain, I'm assuming that the miners working on finding the key blocks arent changing their proof of work block header to the latest updated micro block every time it is released. And if they don't then the network has no way of knowing if the chain of micro blocks they have seen is the final and complete chain micro blocks originating from a given key block.
Amd I explaining this ok?

@_date: 2015-02-23 15:23:59
Net positive for some users, sometimes.
Card companies make money. It's their job to make money. They do this by transaction fees, interests and various other fees.
In plain english the cost of operating the transaction network plus the profit of those companies come out of the pockets of the consumers. Either by straight up fees or by increased prices by the merchant so he can pay the fees.
Those people who have a net positive effect from credit cards are because of good creit ratings and good cashbacks and bonuses. These are rare and are usually only a true bonus for a select few at the expense of the majority who pay alot to use the card. (The interests, overdraft etc from most users pay for the cashbacks for some and everyone wants to be the one who makes it out on top, but very few people do.)
Btw: great job derailing this conversation. Whether or not credit cards are a net positive for some users was not the topic at all. Only that the cost of operating is paid by the consumers.

Interests would be lower, but not non-existant. Banks would be expected to pay interests for holding your bitcoins because it would allow them to invest in lucrative business ventures.
An oversimplification would be to say that the interest rate would be equal to todays interest rate minus the factor of inflation.
Money in your hand today will allways be worth more than money you are expected to receive tomorrow. The difference in value between the two can be though of as base line for an interest rate.
EDIT: The deflationary nature of the coins matter of course. Hoarding is valuable because you expect to get more for your coins tomorrow than you do today. This doesn't fundamentally change the value of lending, though, it only skews the price because it makes it more profitable to lend out your money if you are holding it for later anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:55:10
I agree that modesty is the prudent move here. I agree that we should move carefully and evaluate properly; if we first break it we won't be able to put it back together.
However, that doesn't mean that the price increase is becaue the Core Devs made the right choice. That is simply your opinion or guesswork. It might just as easily be, and could easily be aragued by someone else, that bitcoin is so fantastic that the price has increased in spite of the actions of the core developers.
My point is, I agree with you, but you are diluting your argument somewhat by stating that last bit as a fact. (Or in a way that looks like you are stating it as fact.)

Obfuscation is allways a great strategy until it suddenly isn't. While I don't disagree with you I feel the need to point out that if someone has an idea of what your choice of obscurity is, they will have a much easier time bypassing your security. 
Say if your wallet was stolen by someone who knows you or someone who takes the time to research you, they might decide to try languages that you might have chosen to use. 
These are of course extreme examples, but security is a profession of eventuals.

Wouldn't necessarily need to be full-loop. It would be enough for the price of bitcoin relative to some other reference currency (usd) to be stable over medium time spans. 
It is not possible as a business to operate with prices in bitcoins yet because it is impossible to predict how much [other] currency that equals that they can use to pay their bills. They don't need to be able to pay their bills in bitcoin, but they need to be able to predict how much bill-paying power those bitcoin provide.

How is the block size going to be sufficient in 50 years if everyone are performing micro and medium transactions constantly?

Excellent article. It was very balanced and thorough on alot of the subjects that are often glossed over. And also understandable for more than just those who frequent this subreddit.
I personally appreciated the focus on how it being a deflationary currency not necessarily is a good thing. I dislike how that is often touted as the most important and best property. It is better than the current dangers of hyper-inflation, but there are definite problems with that property as well. I really enjoyed how this article acknowledged that **and** explained how it can be rectified if and when it is necessary to do so.

This article reports on extremely old news. And it is horribly writtten and confusing.
First of all, being taxed capital gains tax or not has nothing to do with being recognized in any capacity. It would have been extremely strange if bitcoin gains were not subject to capital gains tax.
What is even crazier is that the same guy, the director general of taxation, earlier this autumn said that bitcoin would be taxed capital gains and VAT. Meaning you had to pay VAT any time you bought bitcoin. He has not confirmed this after that initial interview, but neither has he withdrawn the statement. We still have no idea what he meant.
I'll gladly pay capital gains, but enforcing VAT makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

How does this forwarding address thing work? How can I verify that what I send to your forwarding address will be sent onward to TotalBiscuit.
Please don't tell me 'trusted memeber', 'look at past transactions', or anything similar. The basic premise of bitcoin is to be able to establish trust in a trustless system. Where are the signed messages that confirm that TotalBiscuit verifies that as a forwarding address? Or anything similar...

I just wanted to point out here that society mostly  benefits from having a distributed population. A numer of things, farming for instance, would be extremely hard to accomplish without the ability for a portion of the populace to live in a rural environment.
You might want to stop subsidizing their electricity and mail, but then they'll stop providing food for your country (I'm going to assume USA).
PS. And just to dot all the I's, most western countries subsidize their farmers because they are not able to make a profit on their own in competition against imported food. However it is generally a good idea to have at least some minimum of food production locally in case of a major catastrophe, war, embargo or shift in trade balance.

For anyoen that has done it a time or two it's easy, but the first time you decide you want some and you expect to be able to log onto ebay, give them your credit card and pick up a few shiny coins - you are going to get disappointed.
That is the only thin that stopped me in early 2012, and it surprised me again when I bought in this summer. It took me about ten days from when I decided I wanted to go ahead to when I had my first coins. (Albeit I did not go full speed for the full ten days, but still.)
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:20:28
But buying a thousand bitcoin will drive the price up somewhat which will trigger more bitcoin to be put up for sale. This again will trigger others to buy to speculate which will drive up demand which will make it more difficult to pick up the new coins put up for sale.
All in all, it is very hard to estimate what the average price of such a large order will be. Just as hard to figure out how quickly and aggressively one should buy to get the best prices.

The difference is that under the **current** transaction adoptation algorithm it is more than inconsequentally likely that an unaccepted transaction will not ever be included in a block. This is not an unchangable truth, but it does give shorter block-cycles an advantages under the current algorithms.
Outside of abandoned transaction, however, you are correct.

For me it's been mroe lucrative so simply buy as soon as you can transfer the funds. Even if I know there will be bubbles along the way they generally don't swing as low as price is 'at this moment'.

While there is no government that is setting the value of bitcoin by decree, it still only has value because 'we' say so. In a manner, I believe it is correct to call bitcoin fiat.

I was using Lumia for a while. And I loved the Metro UI. I recently switched back to android, but that was for my [pebble](
Your app did work and did what it needed to, but I'd like to take this opportunity to comment on it anyway. I used it myself for a few weeks and then I tried to get a friend set up with it later. 
It's been a few weeks so my details are wonky right now, but the gist of the problem was that once we added a private key or two, also tried blockchain account, we couldn't easily observe or spend transactions from that address. The UI is so centered on opening it the first time and adding keys that we spent full minutes figuring out what to do after we added one. 
Please hide the settings/add address after initial launch. Open straight into a primary wallet and let us see transactions and easily make transaction / request them.

I did mean 'of no value'. My eventuality is that everyone that buys haords it and no one uses it for transactions. This leads to massive price growth until suddenly some outside force acts upon it and everyone realises it has less value. Prices plummet and since saving was its only purpose it now has no purpose. No one wants to buy and the market crashes.
Ulitizing the transacational benefits of bitcoin hedges its futute between its two main properties. This makes it less likely to fail.

People are allready reasonably used to saying 30k when talking about 30 thousand. It's a small stretch to 30 kbit being 30 thousand bits. And when speaking in larger values you may refer to 15 bitcoin as being 15 million bits. 
I just like it better than milli and micro for their written notations being confusing with u as mu as micro as well as the spoken versions having far too many syllables.

Agreed, great article.

TL;DR: Dont be afraid to spend bitcoin, just rebuy the coins asap.

If my bitcoins were valuable enough I believe I would be willing (though not happy) to accept a change in the protocol made by a majority of the miners, however malignant. The alternative would be to abondon it and the value they hold, right? 
(All of this is of course assuming someone managed to control 51% of the networks hashing power for some length of time.)

I would imagine a system where you have several propriatary super nodes monitoring the network. Your PoS shop will poll random nodes around it for the transactions and also poll the global super nodes. Give it x seconds for y super nodes to return that there are no attempts at racing from any of the other global locations and you can be fairly certain that there are no published transcations attempting a double spend with a race - you confirm the purchase.
To clarify: My understanding is that most miners will be honest and that to get them to accept a higher fee, later transaction you will need to shield your first transaction from reaching those miners for n amount of seconds. If your first transaction has been observed by most miners a significant amount of time before the race transcation arrives, it should be prioritized.

It annoys me to no end when people say that using bitcoins will make them immune to taxes (or that they would want to, but my government doesn't waste a better part of the global economy on war).
The government will no longer be able to grab your money with impunity with the help of your bank that is holding your money. But they will still be able to force you to pay your taxes. If you are working for a company in a region with a working government then that company will have to report your earnings and you will be forced to pay taxes by pain of imprisonment or confiscation.
Most people will not be the owner of global stateless corporations operating outside the reach of government.

Are bitpay taking the risk of the price dropping **while conducting the transastion**?
Edit: I never noticed before that they necessarily take on the risk of the price changing during the transaction. That can still fluctuate pretty badly during the time someone is given to complete the transaction. Between they quote the price and they have the bitcoin on hand to sell the customer can spend several minutes and might even cancel the transaction. Whats to stop me opening a large order under a price fall and only 'sell' my bitcoin if the price crashed substantially - offloading my loss to bitpay.

It may be digital, but so is the dollar, mostly.

Ahh yes of course. I was mostly circlejerking the whole "I have bitcoin therefore I am now a millionaire"-motto, but I can see how my statement could have been read as me thinking you had bought a house on that there Plantation-thingy.
Also I find it sad that anyone has to go to college and not be allowed to drink =(

Calling all subscribers of this subreddit. Please browse /new and downvote all these stupid image macros before they hit /hot.
They are getting in the way of actual content.

While you are not wrong, I recommend you read [the proposition here.]( It made a lot of sense to me. mBTC and uBTC is extremely cumbersome.

Are you concerned that they will store and make use of your palm scan? (Leak it to someone else?).
I suppose that is a half-way valid concern, but please remember it is not used for authentication on the ATM - only for authorization/protection against over-use.
One practical way of looking at it is "your biometrics should not be used instead of your passwords, it should replace your usernames". It's easy and quick, but anyone can make a copy and impersanate you.

All in all it was an excellent video. Well done, sleep well.
Next time, make the curve proper =)

Mining would become more profitable and more people would enter the mining market driving the profitability of mining down until an equillibrium was reached.

I appreciate your effort, but even with the disclaimer. People are going to test their own password.
I'm willing to bet someone is allready sniffing all packets to and fro that site and making a list of all password tests.

Do you have any source or further information on this? As a scandinavian I'm very interested.

I truly wish I had more upvotes to give you. Thank you for this well-written and thourough explanation of important psychological phenomenons.

Spending stimulates businesses to accept it. Saving only drives the price up without adding utility, to the point where it might be overinflated and in need of a correction.
The only way to really get bitcoin off its feet is to use it as it was intended to be used.

I really have no idea how I'm supposed to interpret a bolded statement in paranteses. On a scale from important to background information, what emphasis should I put on it?
This page makes it impossible to quickly pick up the major points of the topic.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:32:56
But that puts the burden of finding a solution in your hands, it's hardly hassle-free at that point.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:05:38
Your idea is great and the suggestion valid, but please don't be specific in descriptions that are wrong. Admit to not having the details and ask for someone to help you complete the thoughts. 
Writing inacurate statements like this only makes it harder to figure out what to do.

Sure, go ahead. That would also be correct. It would, however, not be equally as funny as this graph. Mainly because I am not as interested in lotteries as I am in bitcoins.
We are all aware that this is not a prediction of the future, we are simply enjoying a fun fact.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:41:41
That is like saying 'because', why is the network effect important in this case, but was not so for altavista, myspace or any other first mover that later got surpassed?

You are betting his ass?

The article may be good, but the translation leaves me unimpressed. Sorry to whoever took their time, but I wouldn't call this great and I wouldn't show this to anyone being curious about bitcoin.

ONE of the points is that you MAY. Not that you should.

They really should provide a verification in the form of a message "payments to this address will be forwarded to XXX" and then sign that with the private key of the address in question. This should be openly available on their page as part of their forwarding product.
But thanks a bunch for the explanation. I do wish you and TotalBiscuit all the luck in the world. I'll hold my donations until his actual and verified announcement, but Im definitely donating and definitely watching.

But I'd gladly give them **some** power. It's supposed to be decentralized so the more actors the better.
I'm still going to need bankin institutions for services such as loans or escrow in the future. There is a room for them in the future if they are clairvoyant enough to see it.

TCP and html and http was fairly basic in the beginning, but their ability to change and adapt to coming challanges is what makes it the technology we still use to day. If bitcoin can keep up with the curveballs that are thrown at it, then it will not fail like an early commercial product that had better competition challenge it.
@_date: 2013-10-18 12:41:26
I shudder at the the realization of personal cheques coexisting in the same economic ecosystem as bitcoin.
It is inconceivable for me how banks/stores/people in some countries still accept or carry personal cheques.

I find it unbelievable that people in the US accept paying the insane fees on ATMs that they do. I was shocked to see the fees and maximum withdrawal limits when I was there.
I hardly use cash more than a couple of times a year, but if I need to I can find a 24 hour atm with zero withdrawal fees easily within a 100-200 meters in a major city. Those fees are af course covered by the bank that I keep my money at.

I believe what you are trying to articulate here is a global issue - no matter if the monetary system is inflationary or deflationary: It is difficult to predict what you might need tomorrow, so you should spend as little as possible today to increase your chances of survival.
However many people are not able to see that far ahead and will be blinded by purchasing power. Also while I believe that this saving-for-tomorrow thinking has alot of merit I do not think that inflationary systems promote this behaviour more than deflationary systems. The opposite is more likely.
Though I may of course be completely wrong.

I read this as making a point of just how horrible using decimal places is. The fact that you never really know if the decimal seperator is supposed to be a comma or a dot doesn't really help when you are dealing with 16 983 millibitcoins. Add a comma or a dot there and get wildly different values depending upon your location.

It seems he added the percentages up and divided by 10. Thats not how you average growth.
