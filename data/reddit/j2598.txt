You don't write someone off for meeting with the CIA. You wrote someone off for community disapproval we see here. 
Its great to see widespread self protection from this community. Not only is price holding but so does the bitcoin community under heavy attack. I didn't expect this. It can still Crack but the resilience of the community which I saw as a weak point compared to the protocol which in turn has its weaknesses... Is surprising.

So, let's say you have a private key worth $100mil. The court now has the power to confiscate the funds... But it needs a court order. There is no provision for what happens for when they lose the funds and no upgrade on court order requirements. Can we get a list of every crypto exchange in the USA? The US has a disrespect of borders - do we need to think beyond them?

Btc was actually more expensive when I was there 3 years ago. 
The trick before was to take in USD as cash and then exchange on black market for a better rate. This made you like 3x richer than drawing cash out of the wall. 
Now the official rate is liberated so the market is different. 
How does Bitcoin come into it -  not necessarily. 
The more popular move before was insurance swaps and bond swaps, a lot of Argentine elites were doing this to preserve wealth from decimation.
The peronismos might see this as final  fiscal defeat and occupation of their country,but that's a chat for another day.

I use voipcheap. 0.01 typical. But lots of security blocks on payment. Call quality often bad but... Usually good enough. No monthly fee. Has callback in the app. Managed to get a DiD years ago when free...
I swapped to localphone as they have some interesting innovations. But... The call reliability has been low. And no callback from the android app, only iPhone version. 
Am prepared to pay for something more professional. But it needs to at least be cheaper than this. 
Bitcoin solves problems in high fraud areas such as prepay VoIP. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 12:30:21
Is it common practice to share private keys? 
I think it is on topic because the people wanting access to information for law enforcement I don't think fully realise that information is money.
That is, it's one thing to search a property... But it's another to get information worth millions of dollars. 
If you have to hand over private keys then you're handing over money. We have seen this result in the loss of funds. 
What might be appropriate would be that the warrant to be proportional to the funds a suspect can prove are at stake... Basically just acknowledging information as value. 
Bitcoin is relevant because it is one of the most simplest examples for information as money.

^ be sure to select the UK as dominicle
There are funds such as Asia Pacific but what you'll find is that when you dig into the details the fund is not really away from the western economy. For example, an Asia Pacific fund is actually over weighted to Japan with a minority in China - next to no investment in places like Indonesia etc which are not necessarily emerging but are culturally and financially away from the west. In other cases when you dig into the fund you find that it's US or UK companies operating in the target country at best - but those companies actually still have an overwhelming exposure to the western economy. 
Perhaps it possible to put individual stocks in a UK pension fund manually? If so, you'd be limited to the ftse I presume, but perhaps you could select companies which are operating away from then economy of the stock exchange from which they are listed. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 12:03:41
Interestingly I wanted to invest a portion of my pension *in economies less linked to our own*. So, instead of places like USA, UK, Europe, Australia, 
I wanted to invest in:
- asset rich middle eastern countries not economically tied to the west 
- China, the phillapines, Indonesia 
- russia
- south American countries not economically tied to the IMF and 'the west' 
These are some very broad options. 
What you'll find is that pensions are ring fenced to our own economic allies. You aren't allowed to diversify your assets to anywhere truly outside the effects of a 2008 style crash. 
So this is nothing new. 
It is about protection. protectionism.

That's what surprised me - the exchanges are KYC and regulated. They are saying you have to be regulated to be a bitcoin exchange on the one hand, and then saying it's not regulated. 
This leaves onchain transactions as unregulated... But that doesn't fully wash because the blockchain is a public ledger. 
So wants left? what it comes down to is that they want the ability to break any transaction, not just the exchanges, they need complete control... Which is quite a frank admission of totalitarianism. 
Thank you bitcoin for making this just a little bit clearer. 
Some still won't get it though so the journey continues.

Then you don't have 8 btc in your pocket. Most likely you exchange for fiat. If it's in cash form then that's a security risk, be that from thieves or border crossings. If it's in a bank account then you have all the disadvantages of a bank account.

Is there some guide for selling on otc less than $100k to read. Last time I looked at otc the process with pgp and / or btc sign was hassle plus feedback takes time... Alternatively... Sourcing a broker for these lower amounts 
@_date: 2016-06-30 09:44:32
So on say, btc-e the would be a 8 lot size at 1:1 leverage so currently would need about $5000 in the account at current price...  but how far would that go before margin call... And how much extra as a buffer... (why 80/90%)?
The risk is that the price spikes and returns back... But how much of a spike is a risk... And what if, as I say,  1:3 leverage..?

So, just to confirm and explain to anyone who hasn't been following:
Julian Assange was suspected to have been abducted a week or so before the US elections because Internet was cut and at the same time we saw some evidence for an abduction, including a rendition flight leaving shortly after. 
Since that point nobody has seen Assange (proof of life) and also there has been a change in tone of the publishing. 
The explanation from the Ecuador embassy is that they cut Internet access on the basis of pressure from the US and that Assange is OK. We don't believe that. This is a way to really find out what is going on. 
The blockchain was used to verify, to timestamp publications. My understanding is that we can use these transactions to verify whether WikiLeaks has been tampered with as many suspect, and by inference, whether Assange is in a Yankee gulag. 
The only thing is that the system of verification is not as straightforward as loading up Satoshi Proof, probably because when they started with this system that app wasn't out there. 
How this helps.

Despite it being a lot of propaganda it has to have something we can take away from it? The thing is that it has the perfect sweet taste for the bitcoiner. 
I read it and it appeals to me:
"yes, I can become a sovereign individual! Yes, I can be free! A new age.... " blah blah blah.

This is definitely a strategy here. In big media we always see the term blockchain rather than bitcoin. I mean this is a strong trend huh? 
This says to me that big power doesn't want to draw attention to bitcoin, doesn't want people using bitcoin. 
There's a high chance big power will address the problem of bitcoin that they have by inventing their own altcoin. 
The difference will be that it has some kind of official backing. Probably they will also try to give it some technical advantage. 
Is this a realistic threat? I think so. 
That said....  
 Centralised power has disadvantages to the bitcoin community. It's slow moving. The democracy of development in the bitcoin has the wisdom of crowds and being first on the block. I just feel that this probably isn't enough.
 I think this will be the announcement to take it to 80,pausing at 133, rather than xt. 
After all this it will continue to exist but overshadowed by the newer currency. Growth will then be very slow but steady and no longer widely speculative.

This guy's a total dinosaur. Nice to hear the viewpoint but it's a shame it's not from someone smart. 
The mask wearing is ridiculed as fear of facial recognition tech... And then a photo of them taken...

I figure if we meet in the busy MTR it should be alright.

What would be some examples of apps having access to that? 
Root file manager - yes. 
File manager, non root - no? 
QuickPic, primacy selling photo browser? - yes? 
Random Internet browser - only when you grant file system access to upload a photo to a website?
