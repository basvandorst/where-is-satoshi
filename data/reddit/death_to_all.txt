You do realise that all legal fees and investers will be paid in full after bankruptcy and what is left will be divided under the customers.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:03:30
Yes remember mtgox. 3 years later and how much have the customers got back?
@_date: 2016-04-11 15:49:19
Every place is an island if you zoom out far enough.

A Rembrandt or Picasso will be taxed like an investment.
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:12:00
Bullshit, they are speaking of EU borders. Not internally like Italy to Austria.
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:18:40
Yes, the miners are so greedy that they leave more then 5 btc in fees in the backlog.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:01:27
So in 10 to 15 years, when there is nothing left to optimize within the 1 mb limit (which has been optimized to cary effectivly maybe 10 mb) and every block is full with transactions that move coins to off-chain solutions. We just move away from Bitcoin. Because we can't change a Bitcoin rule?
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:43:57
This is coinbase:
"My goal is to have Coinbase be neutral in this debate. I think SegWit, BU, or other solutions could all be made to work in bitcoin. We're here to provide whatever our customers want as best we can across all digital currencies, and work with the wider community to make forward progress."
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:17:32
So the rules can be changed. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 06:16:24
And with only Bitfury running BIP148. it won't be the longest chain
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:36:57
But like you said. Even if the super majority changes the rules. It won't be bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:55:39
You see it as supporting both, I see it as supporting neither.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:17:59
If the users follow that majority, then yes it is still Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:34:47
Well the miners need the users to give the coin they are mining the value they need for their income. So the miners will only mine with the new rules if they know or suspect that the majority of the users come with them.
So the majority of the Bitcoin network, which is made of the users and miners.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:42:56
Sure, the miners that have invested millions in hardware will start mining a coin that will be worth a few cents for a few hardcore people. Great investment.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:53:56
First of all, lets asume that the minority of the users will be 10%. Do you really think that 10% of the current users have enough capital to keep in the minority ledger?
Second, after the fork there will be a lot of people on the majority ledger that will sell their minority coins very cheap to crash the price of the minority ledger.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:44:02
Bitcoin as a whole decidedes what IS Bitcoin, so if 90% of the users and 75% of the miners move to a different set of rules, the new set of rules is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:11:42
And yet, non of the exchanges are in favor of segwit, or BU at this moment.
Poloniex is following the core chain as BTC. So non of the exchages is wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:56:22
The consensus rules are defined by the majority of the complete Bitcoin system. And both Core and EC supporters can't prove that they are backed by the majority.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:02:10
That is a list of companies that are ready for segwit. Being ready for segwit or supporting segwit, or BU for that matter is not the same. I have a spare tire im my car and a fire extinguisher in my house. So I'm ready for a flat tire or a kitchen fire, it doens't mean I support it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:58:15
If the majority of the Bitcoin system follows the fork then they are not the alt-coin since the consensus rules are defined by the majority of the bitcoin system.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:05:14
Then the capitol behind it will be around half that of the current ledger, but the same amount of coins. So the value will be around half. Then both of the ledgers will be the victim of people trying to crash the other price by selling their coins below market value.
So miners are now getting the same amount of bitcoin for each mined block, with less fees, since there will only be around half the number of users so half the number of transactions. And every coin they mine will be worth way less.
So even if the miners reach a majority on the rules they will follow, they need a huge majority of the users to follow them otherwise they will be killing their profit.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:17:46
why don't you understand that this contentious Segwit softfork is exactly what would split Bitcoin with 100% certainty?
I feel like I'm screaming at a brick wall!
way to many people DO. NOT. WANT. IT.
get over it! You can't make them want what you want!
your way of annoying them will get you only more opposition!
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:34:23
So just wait for a time where the fees are affordable enough to merge the dust. Untill that time the coins are locked. OK got it
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:01:56
Yes, even higher fees. So how are people going to pay them?
Those are coins that can't be moved off-chain, or spend on chain.
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:00:47
No not all exchanges support segwit. 
Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, Bitstamp. No Segwit support from them.
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:16:19
If 80% of the miner hashrate runs with segwit capable software and 25% runs BIP148 it might work. But now only 60-55% of the mining is done with segwit capable software and only 1 miner with 12% hashrate is signaling for it.
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:09:12
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:23:26
The 55,2% of bitcoins addresses that do not contain enough bitcoin to be send with a high enough fee?
Those are effectively locked.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:28:45
I would not be OK with it, but it would be Bitcoin. 
Remove the coin limit, double the reward, change the PoW, Adjust the diffilculty. All possible to change and still be Bitcoin. As long as the majority is in favor of the change.
@_date: 2016-12-01 14:07:20
Yeah. I think she might have a little bit more power then a bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2016-11-14 21:04:04
It's not like there is concensus over segwit with approx 10% of the hash power running BU.
@_date: 2016-11-14 23:30:03
Sure. Bitcoin.com, the pool of Roger Ver will switch to Segwit any moment now. He has been so positive about Segwit and blockstream/core.
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:43:08
Well. 
Bitcoin.com isn't open for public yet so it will probably rise a little from the 2% it is now. And will stay with BU.
Viabtc is relatively stable between 8% and 10%. And they have been clear with their opinion on segwit.
MGT from Mcafee is just starting and most people suspect him going full BU.
Seems like a slim chance that they drop below 5% together. Even in 12 months. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 21:23:16
89% of the last 1000 blocks, and 95% needed for activation. But we will see at the end of the week.
@_date: 2016-11-15 00:02:55
Call everybody with a different point of view a crazy and orphan them away instead of cooperation. This behavior from both sides is exactly what created the split in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:04:51
Who cares what you think that Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is the chain with the most work that originates from the genesis block. And if that chain is with segwit and 30000 mb blocks then so be it.
@_date: 2016-11-19 02:31:42
Then you can pay the back taxes according to the IRS. Just like losing a sock full of cash under your bed
@_date: 2016-12-14 23:26:23
If the price doesn't fall then it would mean that the bitcoin community has accepted the new coins and consensus has been reached on a new number of coins. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:48:58
For the IRS it is really easy. You bought X BTC worth $XX. Then you sold then or kept them. Losing them will be calculated as selling them for $0 so you write down a capital loss of $00. 
You can balans that out with other gains. But then there is next year.  Or the year after that. Cause your BTC are now under the rader. Unless you keep spending under a specific amount, you will raise money loundring flags.
Have fun explaining to the IRS next year where the extra money you spend came from.
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:35:46
Well if you don't agree what the miners are doing. Start mining yourself. After all its all open source.
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:39:54
Miners devs and users must realise that they are useless without each other. 
If miners leave then the user and devs are going to struggle for months during the recalculating of the difficulty.
If users leave then the miners and devs are left with a block chain that is worthless.
If devs leave then the miners and users are left with a block chain without progress.
@_date: 2016-12-01 13:11:51
Destroying evidence after a ruling from a judge. Great plan.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:12:28
Ts is talking about NL. So who cares about the IRS in this case. Here we pay taxes on all your capital. Crypto, cash, investments, stocks, gold, 2nd house. You are taxed 30% on an expected gain of 4% or something like that. So if you do not declare it during taxes you would have to launder it before spending if it moons.
@_date: 2016-12-14 23:04:00
They won't give themself more coins because the price would fall and the miners will be left with millions in useless hardware.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:04:57
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:00:03
And what are the odds that you have access to a random BCH (yes BCH, not BCC like you call it in your app. BCC is bitconnect) address that is the same as a BTC address?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:09:15
Why shouldn't I use a multi coin wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:15:49
And do you feel forced to spend BTC or USD on BCH?
Do you have that feeling with more cryptocoins? 
I'm feeling more freedom after each coin launch or fork of a chain. There is no reason to stay with a chain that doesn't align with your preferences or ideas. But I understand that not everybody has the same views and not everybody wants to follow the same chain. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:57:00
Bitconnect was first so calling Bitcoin Cash BCC is just being part of the problem of the confusion for beginners.
As for your conditions, your app doesn't seem to be a real wallet. It is a hosted wallet where you're not even in control of your own private keys. I thought you where an actual wallet like the others I mentioned.
If you don't control your keys you don't control your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:56:15
if a crypto noob buys BCH thinking it is BTC on an exchange and tries to send them to his wallet:
Poof. Funds lost.
Send them to  and hey, there are. Wrong coin, but funds not lost.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:41:50
But it holds BTC and BCH, and creates BOTH a BTC and a BCH addres by default. This way you can never send your BTC to an BCH adress by accident or your BCH to a BTC address. This wallet is safer then a wallet that only supports BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:40:20
Imagine that. Giving people free choice. Can't have that.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:00:04
1 download app.
2 open app.
wallets are created
and there they are, BTC and BCH with the same address.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:02:39
My wallet holds BTC, BTG, BCH, ETC, ETH, LTC and more. I must be a genius that I can send the correct coin.
The wallet in my pocket can even hold al 24 different dollars. 
Must be so confusing if I need to pay something when I go abroad.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:53:29
Go down?
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:04:32
Be my guest, if you think you can fork to a chain that will survive. Even better, just fork everyday with slightly different rules. Surely one version must stick. Try it for every coin in the top 10 at coinmarketcap.com for the best chance for succes. 
We all choose to run around in an unregulated permissionless system. And the people who can't keep up shouldn't step up.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:08:27
Multi coin wallets are now forbidden. Haven't you heard?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:47:48
Then sell it if you never wanted it. But nobody needs permission to create a fork in a permissionless enviroment like bitcoin. Nobody owns the name. And before august 1 both BTC and BCH where the same chain. And both originating from the genesis block, so a name that includes the name bitcoin is normal. 
Like ETC. It continued under the old rules so they added classic at the end.
If people can't even see the difference between BTC and BCH the abreviation or the full name then they shouldn't invest in the crypto world. A world where you can lose your entire investment with the accidental push of a button with no way to turn it back.
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:47:19
Why would a chain split result in $550 / $450 when just 13% ( of the companies support it. Just 8% (  of the nodes signal it. And 12% ( of the hashpower votes for it. It would be more like a $120 / $880 split.
And with so little hashpower behind it. It is also profitable for the other miners to use a little hashpower to mine empty blocks on the UASF chain and destroy the value for it. Resulting in a higher price for the old chain.
@_date: 2016-02-06 17:16:59
So buying a cup of coffee is spam?
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:00:29
Raising your fee will only bump you to the front of the line.  It doesn't make the line any shorter.  So while you are no longer having issues, the backlog keeps growing.
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:09:56
Every exchange is going to trade both coins in case of a fork or chain split. They wont leave money on the table since both of the coins will be traded and they make money on fees.
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:19:00
How is the only miner that is signaling BIP148, BitFury, with just 12% of the hashrate, goint to create the longest chain?
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:42:05
Almost al of the people supporting EC won't be in favor of the UASFcoin and will try to dump them. 
There are several Pro-Segwit people who are anti-UASFcoin and will dump them. 
And last but not least, the Pro-UASF people will try to dump the coins without UASF. 
So why would a exchange think, "Neah, fuck all those fees, let the competition have all of that."
@_date: 2016-09-23 18:05:47
Then they shouldn't be at any exchange. 
@_date: 2016-09-27 08:40:19
They give somewhere between 50 and 200 satoshis every 30 minutes. But you need like 8000 minimum to transfer them out. So not that great for checking your own wallet.
@_date: 2016-09-12 21:42:04
So we should scale the entire bitcoin network to your personal situation with your isp and your bandwidth limitations.
@_date: 2016-09-23 17:14:09
Unless you are actively trading. You shouldn't keep them at any exchange.
@_date: 2016-09-27 12:41:31
They are worth money. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 19:20:22
You have a problem with a company paying you USD through PayPal.  And you are done with bitcoin? 
How the hell does that work.
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:38:05
You can if they are clowns.
@_date: 2016-10-17 09:45:57
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:57:26
So I would strive for bitcoin to be something to be for everybody. But do nothing to reach that goal?
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:40:21
It does give the biggest group a voice.
Edit. There are 3 groups. The miners. The programmers and the users. Right now only the miners and programmers can decide which direction everybody goes. Giving the users  a vote will provide a bit more power to the group that create the wealth of bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:51:30
What yours is yours on the chain. It might only be really easy to perform an 51% attack if you got a lot of procccesing power for a short time but they can't move coins around without your approval.
@_date: 2016-05-20 22:00:51
Core being the superior code cause the miners don't want to change. 
I don't care if you are in favor of changing the block limit or not but that is some bs. They are afraid cause both sides are spreading bullshit for their cause. 
Fact is that the biggest part of this community is not capable of steering this discussion. Bitcoin might be the only piece of open source software where the biggest group of users can't have any say in the direction we are going.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:26:05
Probably the Ui of the wallet from wich the 38 was sent.
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:55:49
But we can't go faster. We can pay the fee and hope there aren't a lot of people bidding more to take this bus. Or we can wait for the next one and hope we don't get bumped to the back of the line again.
Edit. Increasing speed limit is like decreasing the 10 min average. Nobody wants that. We want more seats on the bus.
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:37:16
Am I wrong if I want bitcoin to be available to people that only make 1$ a day in wages. Because to them half a dollar is a lot in a fee. And for them it will be a big change if they can send money around to family and friends.
 Even if the amounts mean nothing to you and me, it can change their lives.
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:21:54
Because I want bitcoin to be accessible to the entire world and not only people that can spare 50 cents on a fee?
Or should bitcoin BE only available for people who are wealthy enough to spend at least xx $ on fees?
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:44:11
So we shouldn't strive to make bitcoin something that is available to everybody that wants to move money easy, fast and without regulation?
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:50:50
They believe that there should be a balance between the fee and the block size and they think the scales have been tipping in the wrong direction. Nobody thinks that there shouldn't be a fee at all. The miners have to eat as does everybody else.
And even if the block size will be increased to 10 mb. Miners can still pick only the transection that contain a big enough fee in their eyes. Nobody is going to mine while running a loss. And they want the dissision to lay with the miners instead of trying to outbid somebody else to make it into the pool.
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:52:32
As long as the miners follow core. Core controls the block size limit.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:59:23
Yeah. Poor people should just leave bitcoin for the wealthy western world. Fuck people in the 3th world who make 1$ a day and want to send their money to family.
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:23:08
As a miner you do not have to fill the entire block. So just fill it with transactions to pay the bill.  If the fees drop to low do just mine empty blocks. But there is a big gap between mining free transactions in an unlimited block size and use it as an auction where people must bid the highest to clear their transaction.
We must find a middle ground but right now it is in favor of the rich western world.
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:31:06
But who is going to dicide what spam is. Is every transaction from poor people spam? Does bitcoin need a minimum wage to use? With Google and Facebook trying to provide Internet access in 3th world countries, there are going to be a lot off people connected that can only Offord only a few satoshi's. Can we just say fuck them and keep bitcoin for us?
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:53:36
It's better to state your opinion so people who don't know what it is Al about can read up and decide for themself.
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:07:59
Until the halvening. Until the halvening. Until the halvening. Until the halvening....
And now they are left with a single bitcoin for every block. So they might hope they a going to be worth a metric fuck ton each.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:14:26
But the person holding the coins probably will.
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:22:54
Well the wallet thing is only a guess off mine. But if you use some logic, why else would somebody send 38 btc instead of 38$. 
Unless the sender is so intoxicated that he couldn't see the difference between $ an btc.
Edit. Changed could to couldn't. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:47:25
There is always the recalculating of the difficulty. Or a hard fork if we need to switch to a different algoritme for security.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:28:04
For a lot of people, but it's not really easy to get away with it.
@_date: 2016-05-20 21:33:49
Well if we have an agreement where is sent you 38$ by wire and accidently send you 38k $ and you don't want to wire it back. I can sue you. And a judge will be done in 10 seconds. 
If we have an agreement where i send you 38$ to address X and I send you 17k $ right where you wanted it to go. The judge will need 10 min to get the subject en 10 sec to rule in my favor.
Unless you got a really smart lawyer that can sell a judge on the fact that you don't have any access to that 17k $. But a lawyer that good might cost you more than that amount.
Edit. Unless we live in seperate countries. Then 17k $ might not be enough to go to court. But then again. Do you want to mess with somebody that can spend 17k $ in bitcoin with the risk of losing it all.
Edit 2. And if you win the civil case where you prove that the 17k $ is not yours. What you gonna do. It's black money now. Gotta launder it before you spend it, else your local or federal (what ever country you live in) taxes kick in. So it might be just me. But while the cash gives me a nice boost. It won't be worth the hussle.
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:05:29
Unless you live in the 3th world and can only afford to own a few satoshi.
Bitcoin right now is for a small percentage of the world. If we want to make it available to everybody. There needs to be more room on the bus. 
Edit. Full blocks are not scary at all. But they limit the spread of bitcoin to people who are already wealthy enough to be able to use so many other methods of money transfer.
@_date: 2016-05-25 12:00:03
If I send you 450 times what I'm supposed to and you refuse to send it back. We meet in front of a judge. Where you can explain without your lawyer during a civil case why you won't pay back. Or why you let me send that amount to a wrong address.
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:02:58
When will the poor people in the 3th world learn that bitcoin is not for them. Step up your game instead of working for 5$ a week.
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:18:40
But if you only allow high value transactions. You keep it for a small part of the world. Almost everybody in the world is rich enough to own a satoshi. Not everybody is rich enough to use several satoshi as a fee.
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:38:06
It is still a fact that the higher the fee. The smaller amount of people worldwide is able to afford using bitcoin. 
So while there are plenty of problems for a lot of people around the world. We shouldn't close a door to them regarding money transfer.
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:16:42
It does matter if you are in favor or against the block size increase. The block size does keep growing. So there is nothing the devs can do. Every year it will take longer to download the entire chain. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 22:02:38
Hi it's your friendly neighbour the IRS. We see you bought a house and a nice car. Last year you said you where broke at your tax return and your employment does give you a salary.  But not this big. Care to explain where the money comes from. And don't forget your taxes.
