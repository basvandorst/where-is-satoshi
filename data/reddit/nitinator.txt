What happens if the banks (and or other traditional exchanges) start to trade in crypto? - coinbase goes down?

Stock/equity trading is a perfect precedent for this.  And they're applying the same methods of taxation.  However this is a fresh awakening for those who've never done stock trading but are totally into tech and crypto and bought bitcoin.

In Canada you'd pay Cap Gains Tax on half that.  Not sure of US

Doubt so, like i_gotta_say mentioned above, the minute you move it out of bitcoin and into something else, you're taking advantage of the gain and therefore eligible to pay taxes on those gains.  Want to get more complicated? - take out a portion and not all and then be prepared to explain it to your accountant who'll likely ascribe a portion of the gain to the portion you took out.

Fair enough - deleted.

Hear that sound? That's the sound of the tax reaper coming...

I guess you've never reported equity trading before b/c reporting this is EXACTLY the same, and EXACTLY as tedious.  You need to pull a report of your trades over a time period from your brokerage (e.g. Coinbase), then you need to summarize how much went in and how much went out, and how much you paid in fees.  in - out - fees = taxable amount .... that being said, i'm not an accountant so best to verify this with them first (btw, they charge extra for going through your investment trading activity)

Ok, but really, what did people expect when they started trading currencies to make money? - I get that the IRS is being a bit aggressive and this seems more like an experiment by them than a real tax grab, but I know that whenever I make a buck I have to pay tax.  Don't you?

Dammit no!  I was talking to a friend yesterday who said I was making a big deal out of nothing as net neutrality just means the ISP's can throttle bandwidth but not actually block sites.  It sounds like tomatoe vs tomato, because if they're making it a pain to access certain sites then isn't that nearly blocking them? - perhaps approaching an antitrust suit?

There's a mixed bag of people jumping into crypto investing (investors, retail guy jumping the wagon, anarchist, nerds, etc.) - this type of investment provides an interesting level of obfuscation if you did want to invest.

You're kidding me right? - how is FCC's actions towards limiting net neutrality a scam or bogus?  I could see Homeland Security getting hot and heavy about inspecting everything.

You're right, I misunderstood, you did start talking about legal precedent.  Now my interest is piqued - I just assume there must be legal precedent because it's the IRS who have been trolling for taxes for many years, so they must have done something like this before...  Can't wait to see what the lawyers say!

Forming a fiat crypto will also raise the ire of the other countries that are still trying to figure out how to "handle" crypto.  First they're trying to figure out whether and how to regulate it, now there's a hybrid!  Doh!

This sounds like the holy grail of in-game purchasing for game shops - they can basically own the bank/exchange!  Yes this is Korea, with different gaming regulations than Sweden, the US or Canada, but is this a good thing?

China is trying to stall bitcoin/crypto while they figure out how to make their own and integrate it into their economy.  The problem is that crypto increases with utility so if they close it to outside use then ?

Isn't this the purpose of an exchange?  Aren't exchanges just mini-banks in that they convert currency, but don't offer loans, mortgages, chequing accounts, etc.  I envision crypto to abstract away from the institutional chains entangled around fiat, and allow you and I an option to trade assets in an option outside fiat.
