Why Bitcoin = Because it's the most difficult to attack.
Bitcoin Killer = Star Trek Style Replicator that can take material from the surrounding environment automatically to create goods out of "nothing".

Regardless of what *should* be the case, the Federal Reserve actually does control money printing, even if the Treasury handles the mechanical act of doing the actual printing.
You're being highly misleading.

Not really. People simply have to perceive that they can charge more for each Bitcoin.
If everyone selling decided that $100k was the new price people have to pay to get one, and no sellers go below that significantly, $0 would have to "flow in" to make that happen.

That would be pretty cool.
From the explanation below it sounds like it might not have a steep fee cause you have to already have an account. Still, that's pretty rad and could make it easier to use Bitcoin while being out shopping.

If Bitcoin hits and maintains $1m by then, people would be rather silly to leave their money in dollars.

If banks weren't a government sponsored scam you'd have a point.

Won't watchtowers make it so that (when they are deployed) you won't have to have those funds in a hot wallet to use LN?

There are more ounces of gold than Bitcoins, thus the larger cap.

On that, we are 100% agreed.
My only point is that the bill comes due eventually, contrary to what "economists" claim, printing unlimited amounts of new currency WILL have an impact.
Fiat inflationary economic theory is basically a cult, and these people believe that you can just infinitely devalue a currency without it impacting the value of it at all. Because that's what their econ 101 class taught them, so it must be true.

Go look up what happened in Cyprus in 2013 (I think it was 2013).
Basically banks there had another bailout, but this time (and this applies for a future bailout in the US and EU, too, according to publicly stated plans) it was a "bail-in", i.e., banks confiscating depositor funds to fund their liabilities, rather than a "bailout" which is the government cutting a check from the taxpayers to fund those bank debts.
In exchange, the bank gives you an equivalent amount of stock as an IOU. However, as you might realize already upon hearing that phrase, a bank going through a collapse probably does not have stock worth anything at all. 
This is what they did in Cyprus, and instead of just taking it, many people there took their money and sheltered it in Bitcoin. Of course this caused a pretty decent bump in Bitcoin price at the time, too.
But the broader point is that bail-ins are not feasible to use if people think there is a way for them to shelter those funds quickly.

Jewish people are like 80% of millionaires and billionaires in the US but only 2% of the population. Weird right.

If it did it would become selfaware from sheer ego. "I am the king! Bow before me!" and it'd start draining bank accounts and buying itself.

The store of value argument was started with Bitcoin, well before BCash ever existed.

They'd just request your private key directly and be like "We promise we won't steal", then immediately empty it, knowing Facebook.

It's the hardest to attack that actually matters :p

Not without causing hyperinflation they can't.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:37:58
It's quite insane. 
If some bank stole my entire life's savings (as if I keep it in a bank lol) I would exact a pound of flesh from the bankers no matter what it took and I am betting there are plenty of others in America who would do the same.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:41:56
Except those old "white" men overwhelmingly don't consider themselves white at all.
