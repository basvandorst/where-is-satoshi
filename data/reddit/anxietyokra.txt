no, but a government can short it and  let it die on the vine

you are correct in theory..but execs at bitfinex are also connected to tether..this is an issue that hasn't been fleshed out and give me a huge pause.

would u consider someone affiliated with the eth network as a scammer? totally legit dude..

also does it make more sense to send a micro amount for safety/margin of error? So it transfers to the intended address without the risk of large sums being stolen by phishing/malware?
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:20:50
is it better practice, to send a micro amount just to confirm it was sent to the right address?

would a ledger wallet and apple desktop be good for safety on the malware issue?

what about cash app

regarding isolated machine, is google chrome good? what do u mean music playlist ? on a cd with seed italizcized?

is cash app safe to hold btc? and i put 40k to buy btc is it cheaper to buy on cash app or coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:01:12
harsh truth: whether you are right or not on btc and its' future,depends on the chinese gov. that controls chinese miners who produce 73% of bitcoins,and also whether some gov. attempt a 51% attack.....

if sound money(btc) affects the rmb/dollar,euro--you can be sure these corrupt gov. will attack btc..for now miners are bribing the hell out of officials until uncle xi decides to cease the mining...mining controls the btc price...they are hoarding and dispensing....lots of ponzi in chinese mining

thank you for providing a great response. i appreciate it. it worries me because we need to stomp out scams and pumps and dumps if we ant to regain retail's trust
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:33:31
thanks. why is it not advisable? coinbase guarantees and INSURES if the site is hacked, you still have your coins . Also i just want to buy with the lowest fees. So if i understand correctly, cash app is cheaper because less process to transfer $  into the app as opposed to coinbase wiring system?

Great..but applying this method will determine if i have phishing,malaware correct? my concern is that the malware/phishing would let pass a small sum but capture(changing address) a big figure the 2nd or 3rd time i transact...Is this an impossibility?

no but i've made lots of $$$ from him. he said to get out of litecoin/eth at the top..he's a pragmatist on btc(and only invested in btc) and well versed in the space.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:15:04
 this is a compelling argument-not. this guy was correct on 2017 bull and 2018 bear market. bull in early 2019 and bear in august. he obviously has inside info,and you don't
