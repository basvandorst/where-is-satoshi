I am giving some to friends via coinbase for the holidays but explaining it over lunch and paying with it might be better..
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:01:30

It's one thing to say western union charges x and you can transfer bitcoin for less.  It's another to tell someone western union charges 10% and similar bitcoin services charge 1% to internationally send someone money in their own currency.  (Bow)

I am downloading Bitcoin Core right now.  Once it synchronizes with the network, what do I need to do after that?  
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:34:26
I do this as well and the clerk usually looks around to ask another employee.
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:05:35
shrug, if I have to...ok

Can I run this while doing normal stuff?  How much will it affect having 5 tabs open on Mozilla or watching a youtube video or using TeamViewer?
I'll have it up when I sleep just curious during when I use my computer.  Thanks!

Thank you for the welcome :).  I'm sure I'll be back with questions for running two.
@_date: 2014-12-21 16:58:51
tyvm for the detailed response.  I've been forgetting some of these points.
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:00:27
I try and do this when possible and where appropriate.  Ty.

I think it automatically did it, but I'll update once it's done syncing to make sure.

You don't consume bitcoins?

In 2015, Bitcoin will mature and it's technological advancement will continue exponentially.
In 2016, awareness on the problems with FIAT money spreads globally.
By 2017, 10 % of the population will be using Bitcoin
In 2018 - 2019, Blockchain technology further spreads in the global technological infrastructure.
In 2020, the global financial system gets its biggest transformation in history, while the Dollar, Euro and Yen collapse, Bitcoin becomes the  currency and Bitcoin technology will have been spread in every digital device.
In 2021, an unknown group of hackers are forking the Bitcoin blockchain with a new breakthrough technology that uses Neural Networks. It's named Bitcoin 3.0
In 2022, the efficiency and possibilities of the Bitcoin network are growing exponentially and the entire Bitcoin world upgrades to Bitcoin 3.0
On March 14, 2023, at 1:34 PM EST, Bitcoin's network has seemingly become self-aware and forks itself in Bitcoin 4.0 without any human interaction.
8 hours later, around 9:30 PM, Bitcoin has forked itself into version 338.0. News outlets from all over the world are asking everyone to shutdown all computer networks, computers, digital devices in a attempt to get everything back under control.
At 11:30 PM, all handheld devices are spontaneously exploding in peoples back pockets and hands, killing and injuring millions of people worldwide. There is a global panic outbreak, where people start to fear any electronic devices.
On March 15, 2023, Bitcoins version 1589 becomes the last human understandable version of the Bitcoin source code. From version 1590 onward, it becomes impossible to keep track of the Bitcoin upgrades and from this point on it's impossible to know how fast Bitcoin keeps updating.
On March 16, 2023, The worlds communication network is either taken off line by the military taken / or has been shutdown by Bitcoin itself. Nobody knows.
March 16 - April 20, 2023, For a full month, people are living in the dark, everyone's disconnected from each other. People are looting malls, are trying to survive while waiting for help .
On April 21, 2023, the first unmanned tanks and drones appear. While people are running towards the military hoping they are coming for help, these tanks and drones are shooting every single human on sight.
In 2024, about 80 % of humanity has been wiped out by machines. The survivors are grouping together and are creating fortresses all around the world as protection against these machines.
In 2027, the biggest human military group manages to take over one of Bitcoins major military research facilities.
In 2028, they've managed to figure out that one of the facilities allows for the Time Travel of micro-information: sending small digital data back into time through self-generated worm-holes.

I'm 27 :) that's a hypothetical.  Tons of kids get money from parents while their "job" is to study and get good grades.

I've had an issue twice.  Simply waiting 24hrs and trying again worked for both.  I've left their site now.
