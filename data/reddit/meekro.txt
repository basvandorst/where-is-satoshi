The programmer who [committed that problem change]( must feel like such a loser right now. It's easy to condemn him, but all of us in this profession have made stupider mistakes at some point and I can't help but think, there but for the grace of God go I.

Actually, ChunkHost has that! Creating and destroying a chunk will give you charges/credits that are prorated to the nearest second.

Hey guys, Sergey from ChunkHost here! With all these huge new companies accepting Bitcoin now, I just wanted to remind everyone that we were one of the first to accept it! And, we still do!
Now we offer 1GB VPSes for $5/month (or bitcoin equivalent) -- *iiiif* you prepay for a year!

It's not as bleak as it seems. For consumer accounts, the [EFT act]( forces the bank to assume liability for unauthorized transfers of any kind, *provided that you promptly notify the bank of unauthorized transfers*. 
For business accounts, the question of who pays in these cases is mostly left up to the bank, provided that the bank's policy is reasonable. This has led to some small businesses getting screwed out of a lot of money, mostly by small banks who don't voluntarily guarantee business accounts. One of the articles you linked to was about Experi-Metal's plight, but didn't mention that they [sued and won](
Major banks like Chase and Schwab have always guaranteed business accounts against any unauthorized transfers. Over the last 5 years, many smaller banks have been forced by media and legal pressure to add similar protections.
If you're a consumer, you've always been protected. If you're a business, make sure you actually read the relevant sections of that contract they give you when you open an account; it usually spells out who will be liable if there's an unauthorized wire transfer. And in all cases, *you are only protected if you catch it within 60 days!* So do that.

Absolutely! You choose the OS (Ubuntu is the most popular) and we set up your VPS in about a minute. You either send us your ssh key (for root), or we send you the root password!

This kind of thing is why the world needs Bitcoin. The government wants a payment monopoly so they can use it to shut down those businesses that they couldn't shut down through the courts. We the people should want the opposite: free (as in speech) money.

You're right, they certainly do happen! And all of those cases you linked to were some variant of "employee with signing privileges got phished (including the 2FA getting phished), initiated wire transfer to Croatia, bank later says they shouldn't have to eat the loss because they didn't do anything wrong."
I'm a huge supporter of bitcoin, but I also see that the criticism here is valid. *Good* banks like Schwab have entire teams of computer and banking experts whose sole function is to prevent things like this from happening, as well as guarantees saying they'll eat the loss if it does happen. Whereas, even the best of the bitcoin world (Circle, Coinbase, etc) are mostly shooting from the hip, and shrugging their shoulders when one of their clients gets taken.
We need to be better than traditional banking, not blame the user or give a speech about freedom and the Fed whenever somebody loses their money.

You can either use the borrowing to buy/sell, or to withdraw:
* Put in 1 BTC, and withdraw some USD while keeping your 1 BTC. Now you keep your BTC exposure while getting some USD to spend.
* Put in 1 BTC, and buy another 1 BTC. Now you're exposed to 2 BTC of risk! 
* Put in 1 BTC, and sell 1.5 BTC. Now you're shorting!

Well, [Wikipedia's page on investment]( defines it as "buying or creating an asset with the expectation of capital appreciation... [or other desirable outcomes]." By their definition, holding foreign currencies, gold, or bitcoin because you expect capital appreciation would be an example of investing.
I do find some of the starry-eyed enthusiasm here to be over the top, for sure! I have no idea how to calculate the probability of bitcoin's long-term success, but I'm sure it's not 100%. To claim that it's a sure thing would be pretty absurd, and if that's what bitcoiners in r/investing are saying, then maybe they should be tossed out.
But having said that, I can understand where their enthusiasm comes from: some of the folks who learned of the bitcoin community in 2012-2013 have to realize that it has existed since 2008, and in those early years we were treated like escaped mental patients for talking about bitcoin's future, or for saying that it might have any value at all. The fact that all this went from "several hundred lunatics sending each other worthless coins on a forum" to the point where legislatures around the world are holding hearings about how to safely integrate bitcoin into the existing financial system, in just a few short years, was beyond the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic early participants.
It's like having your personal cat photo blog suddenly become a rival to The New York Times.
I can understand why having a front-row seat for that kind of rise would make some people more than a little optimistic. They've already spent the 2008-2012 era facing down tough critics and proving them wrong.

Quoting [wikipedia on asset]( Probably the most accepted accounting definition of asset is the one used by the International Accounting Standards Board.[6] The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: "An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise."
How does bitcoin not qualify?
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:55:05
It sounds like this ban happened because of brigading, and that's totally reasonable! I hope r/bitcoin's mods can help stop the brigading so this gets sorted out!
But coming from a startup background, "failing to convince people with qualifications" counts for very little, because people with qualifications have had negligible success in predicting which startups would become multi-billion-dollar behemoths. In fact, most world-changing startup ideas seemed utterly insane to people with qualifications when they were first proposed. [This quora post]( jokingly goes over some examples, and Paul Graham has discussed this phenomenon extensively in his essays.
Also, there's [this guy]( who has as much qualification as anyone in economics and finance. He predicted that bitcoin would trade for under $10 by mid-2014. When that didn't happen, revised his prediction to say that it would happen eventually. I suppose he didn't give a new date so he couldn't get humiliated a second time?

We need this compromise because SegWit and BU have been neck-and-neck since March while Ethereum closes the gap with each passing week. Yes, everyone knows that SegWit has a built-in size increase. For whatever reason, half of the hashpower (and a good chunk of the userbase) is not persuaded that it's enough.
SegWit may eventually win the battle, through UASF or otherwise, but the ongoing fight benefits only the altcoins. If this compromise can end the fight even 1 week sooner than it would have otherwise ended, that's reason enough to support it.

Oh, I see what you mean! My understanding was different, that people who bought at $800 might not want to spend them when they're worth $250, but would be happy to spend them if they went back to $800. Which would be a reaction to unexpected inflation.
But, who knows.. either way makes sense.

Yeah, "cloud" is one of those terms that means whatever you want it to mean. ChunkHost actually does issue prorated charges/credits when you create/delete chunks in the middle of a billing cycle. This means you can calculate your per-second billing rate by dividing their prices by the number of seconds in a month/year.

I actually added the note, so thanks for the suggestion.
To take a step back from this, I think it's telling that there's fear over phone numbers, but not so much over email addresses. Phone companies have just sucked at keeping up with the 21st century and providing the kind of selective blocking services that every other communication service does.

Unsubscribing is easy -- when you subscribe it tells you that you just send a text reply with anything and it'll confirm that you're unsubscribed.
Still, good idea, I should add that.

This is always good to hear, but shouldn't they get payment processing restored before they spend lots of money on advertising?
As it stands, even those that *want to* use them can't.

Bank runs are only a problem because banks don't have the money on hand to cover people's deposits, and they don't have it because of the fractional reserve system.

Extra-judicial determinations of what is and isn't a legal site seem evil to me (so much for "don't be evil").
If the government wants to take a site offline (in other words, destroy somebody's business), there should be some semblance of due process. But now, they can just call up their pals at Visa and block the site from the global monetary system. Since a handful of payment companies collectively form a de-facto monopoly, there is no workaround for the small site that finds itself banned.
The site is gone, and there's no due process, no appeals, and no justice.

The legality of dealing drugs is a well-settled issue, but many legal questions on the internet are not. For example, is Kim Dotcom's new Mega service legal? How about the "private servers" run for games like World of Warcraft, based on reverse-engineered server software? These are questions that Supreme Court justices could very well disagree on and at this very moment, they are being decided not by judges at all, but by low-level employees in Paypal's abuse department, based on nothing more than a gut feeling. Regardless of your position on grey area sites, surely you'd agree that we need more due process than that.
Having the right to due process before a judicial panel before your site is cut off would be a huge improvement, but is not perfect either. That panel would almost certainly be a U.S. entity, and it would officially bind the rest of the world to U.S. law. Copyright law is not only very complicated, it varies by quite a bit from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The U.S. doesn't - and shouldn't - own the world, but its control of the current internet payment monopolies seem like a step in that direction.
A successful bitcoin, with consumer-oriented bitcoin payment companies in a variety of countries, will be a step towards fixing that. It'll mean that people outside the U.S. can more readily depend on their own country's law without worrying that the U.S. will use the payment monopolies to do what it couldn't have done through international law.

There's no guarantee, so you have to ask which services will you trust. CoinBase is backed by the biggest and most trustworthy names in Silicon Valley, so it's probably better than some guy's "client side" javascript.

I'm saying the customer should get to choose. You can let the bank lend out your money, and then you get paid interest, or you have the bank hold your money and you pay a holding fee (like you would for a storage locker).
Let the customer know the facts, and let the customer decide. As it is now, many people might not even realize that the bank doesn't simply hold their money.
If public storage lent out your stuff without telling you, you'd probably be outraged.
