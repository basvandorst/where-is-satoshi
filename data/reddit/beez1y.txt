My favorites:
1) Bitcoin
2) Monero
What I think makes sense:
1) Bitcoin
2) Etherium
3) Ripple (but due to them printing I dont like the project)
4) Eos (due to it being protocol layer 1 - how decentralized are they though? And could they be one day if not now? Feel free to reply with opinion)

When the deep chain reorg happened in 2010, did it make all the old bitcoin go away? I've been into technical analysis a long time, this is the first time I've really been a crypto reddit news, so please forgive my ignorance.

so lets say hypotheticaly %x of miners leave. 
Is there a z number of miners needed for the chain to run smoothly?
What if there are W miners, %x of them leave due to mining diffuclty being too high,
and it equals the minors left over, or Q.
What if Q is less than z?
