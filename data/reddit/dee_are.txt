I still think it's just them not handling load. Claiming DDOS is a lot easier than admitting they didn't architect for scale.

"Quite easy" if you've set it up before-hand. Not something you can get going in eight hours after your system fell flat on its face.
There are a lot of "easy" things they can do to get up and running - but none that will get them up and handling this load RIGHT NOW, which is what they need.

I don't actually own any bitcoin, so this is speculation - but I think the issue right now is that everyone has their coin in their mtgox wallet. And, for the average Joe, the easiest way to get them out of mtgox is to sell.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:02:11
Because you wrote this little exchange thing on a shoestring and didn't really think about scale.

Without any insider knowledge - it makes sense to me that the book right now is mostly people who put stuff in yesterday and it's still there. When they fire it up, the trades are going to execute at first at a pretty high level. When those clear, *then* you'll see it approach the price on the other markets.

I really don't think it's a DDOS - it's just that more people were trying to trade than they could support on their hardware. Popularity is often difficult to distinguish from a DDOS. In theory, they could be upgrading the hardware to handle lots more traffic. We'll see in a few minutes if they upgraded *enough*.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:35:52
Again, as someone who's done systems similar to these - easy to say. Hard to implement in 8 hours.

Well, even then you need to get indexes right and design properly. I'm not sure EC2 would've saved them.

The real question isn't an absolute dollar amount, it's how much of your net worth that is. If you have $200 in the bank and nothing else, it is not reasonable to invest it in highly speculative currency trading. If you need that $200 for rent next week, or tuition next month, it is not reasonable to invest it in bitcoins.

Well, it's not uncommon that what looks like poor hardware is actually a badly tuned application. You try the easy fix of "more hardware" and then you start digging into fixing the app. Unfortunately they're now trying to do that after having spent the last X hours up trying to fix the hardware...It's going to be a long night.

Not necessarily. If I go to the buy link, I have this box: "Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Wednesday Apr 17, 2013 at 08:52PM PDT "
So they're saying if you buy today you're going to execute at the market price in six days!

As Robert Heinlein said, The answer to any question starting, 'Why don't they—' is almost always, 'Money.'"
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:45:12
Yeah I posted before that was there. Oh, well.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:16:06
I definitely am betting on it dropping immediately. Even if you have faith in bitcoin, I think a lot of people have lost faith in mtgox.
What happens I also think has a bit to do with how effective their technical fixes are. Is the exchange going to actually *work* when they come back up?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:57:06
Their problem isn't a DDOS - it's that people are using more database than they have, even with the upgrade. Now, they need to tune the application to be more efficient, which is harder.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:29:33
As a guy who's worked on non-financial systems that had popularity flares like this, I'm sure they actually upgraded a database machine and were expecting it to actually fix the problem.
Of course, in the interim, interest only ratcheted up - and a bigger machine can't cover for bad code and DB design. They're probably now frantically trying to fix the next problem that's been revealed - and they're all exhausted, *now*.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:02:20
My thought is that they're clearing the book that is mostly hangovers that weren't cancelled from right before the shutdown yesterday. So expect it to be high to start and then approach the price on other exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:41:40
Well, the database is the central point for all of that, in all probability. So when you hit the website, it asks the database what the latest trades are so it can display them. When the database takes 300 seconds to answer that question...the website hangs.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:33:54
As somebody who runs high-traffic systems, usually it's pretty much fine right until the database falls over, in which case it's down. You get "slow" for a little while until the DB fails...then, boom.
I own no bitcoins and am waiting for it to drop a lot to buy in (so I'm saying things contrary to my interests), but this just feels like a technical problem to me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:33:01
Yeah, I'm not defending them having gotten here, just saying that it's easy to say right now "Why don't they do obvious thing X?". At this late stage "obvious thing X" is going to take a terrible amount of time.
Hopefully they'll stand the load as the US wakes up...
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:34:42
Because they fixed what they could and crossed their fingers. Getting a load test to simulate a real Internet hyper-load is Really Hard. So their only realistic test is to try turning it on.
