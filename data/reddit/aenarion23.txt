LND can have a macaroon only giving permissions to make invoices, not pay them. This is what you would give to the POS app.

I just used this and sold my bcc for btc! It was really easy: I just imported my wallet in coinomi, followed the steps in the link and then sold my btc via the built-in Shapeshift interface. Took some hours to confirm but now I have them!

Eltoo would have fixed this because you cannot lose money in the way he did.

This was mentioned on the conference in Riga this weekend. Tldr was : quantum computing is not for tomorrow, and Jameson Lopp already has an idea about how to upgrade the protocol.

I had the same error. Go to the transactions tab, select the transaction, click options. You should be able to cancel it, then send it again with a higher fee.

He actually is that person and he has a point you are not supporting the network by mining on a GPU. It's like fighting a forest fire with a squirt gun except it is 10000000x times smaller than a normal squirt gun. So there is indeed no point. It is indeed not an answer to your question but if you'd announce this kind of analogous plan on a fire fighting subreddit it's normal you'd get people saying it's a bad idea...

Just change it in the code, find some peers who do the same and you are good to go

I'd sell my firstborn to the devil for some bitcoins right now.

It would not become unprofitable again, it would just reach a new equilibrium

If miners stop mining, the difficulty drops, which means mining becomes more profitable again, which means more miners will start mining again.

You could also "withdraw" by just buying something (say some pixels on satoshis.place) and giving the invoice to the bot

You can fund the with a mobile lightning wallet such as 
If you have enough incoming liquidity you can also withdraw them to your lightning wallet/node

And for how much exactly are you going to sell a private key that you already know about?

Actually this is happening and it's called quantitative easing (or "printing money" if you prefer human language). The European Central Bank creates 60 billion euros out of thin air every month.

Why not?

Is this via bitkassa? Do all bitkassa merchants now accept lightning?
