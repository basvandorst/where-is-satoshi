Cloud mining is a scam. Why would someone sell you hashing power for profit if they can just mine themselves.
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:36:47
Well the world is not anymore what it used to be.

How cryptic.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:31:50
Forgot about It. Right...
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:01:17
100% scam.

Love you too man.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:11:21
Why would large miners go out of business? They can still collect fees if the rewards drop right?
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:48:42
No, yes, maybe.
