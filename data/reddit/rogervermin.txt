They're mining the most profitable coin, they said it themselves, that's what miners do. And that's what the futures say, which after all that talk about being captains of industry and RogerVermin's talk about economics, none of their own DCG exchanges bothered to list futures because they were cowards and against the market. Obviously a shitcoin promoted by traitors and the likes of Gun Sirer attracts no bitcoiners, but it's a chance for anti-bitcoin maximalists at ethereumland.
And why are miners gonna run to a shitchain that pays shit prices when for every JihadWu that leaves there's more left in the real bitcoin?

By that definition, agents would be wowed by a reversible blockchain with a sha256 fetish.

Making a ruckus just because you can take advantage of difficulty readjustment time seems to be at the same level as a script kiddie. Again you haven't explained this automagical idea of how the market will bend to you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:47:45


Depends on the time frame and the current price. If the price is overinflated as it right now, then a miner with a god complex in a country with a panoptycon complex can afford to mine for a long time on the shitty coin, in order to coerce the market into following it and flipping. It's so evidently an altcoin attack it's mind-boggling.

What about drivechains, aren't they enabling POW on second layers? Hence no currency being accepted or transmitted. Fincen doesn't seem to like Proof of Stake very much.

What miners? Shouldn't miner pool operators be ashamed of signalling and then admitting none of their miners asked for 2x, like the btc.top guy did, or the mining pool operator admitting they'll be mining both 1x and 2x, like viabtc did? What exactly do you think a miner is? Miners don't vote for shit, and mining pool operators aren't even miners.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:43:27
Apparently a centralized miner situation that takes advantage of difficulty readjustment time is all the ETH holders at coinbase think bitcoin is. Not the years of storing value behind it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:12:35
LOL! :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:45:44
Futures are the market. You used to care about the term economic majority.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:32:47
The loss in mining were this a natural moment and not a hyperinflated market that can compensate for the scumbags behind the 2x.
The loss in mining where miners follow the market and not the other way around, as such as is the fantasy of the scumbags at the other sub.
Besides, many of the scumbag miner pools with signalling have admitted none of their users actually have asked for 2x coins, so the theory is they'll keep mining real bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:21:07
9 years of value creation vs 48 hours of Jihan fucking your daddy and taking the loss in mining? I understand why altcoiners and shitcoiners would have that idea of what bitcoin is, though.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:27:33
You're such a fucking degenerate.
You and your brigading upvote bots.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:51:43
Well there's this mountain of value, and you think it's reduced to some mining pool operator taking advantage of a month of difficulty adjustment time. Sounds dodgy af.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:37:26
a classic blackhat social network technique
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:32:27
''Miners should be allowed to vote'' LOL.
''Consensus is when centralized miners can bet against the market and futures and can mine a shitty coin for a few months because the price is so currently inflated they can afford to mine their coin and, by taking advantage of difficulty adjustment time, frighten the market away from the truly valuable chain'' LOL.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:35:18
nob2x.org and bizcoin2x futures all indicate you're in the extreme economic minority, and you're still spitting out your obnoxious aspergie crap.

So will your Roger Ver be shoving his sha-256 up his ass when quantum computers come along?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:43:50
Years of whining and the shitcoiners over at rbtc can't even get futures at 13% the value of ''blockstream''. Pathetic.
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:51:38
bcash price on the rocks, s2x futures in the shits, and the mempool is too expensive to spam now. Where's your muhconomic majority argument now?
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:59:45
He labelled it as a threat, like everyone there did except for chainalysis types like Jeff Garzik. The gist was bitcoin was working well starting out as it was decentralized but eventually would stop working as it centralized. ''Satoshi'' then left days after Gavin Andresen met with the CIA.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:18:50
Why not just shorten the difficulty adjustment intervals instead? I mean, let's face it, that's all the altcoin cretins at 2x are taking advantage of for their 'consensus' and 'economic majority', the length of time it takes for difficulty to adjust so they hope bitcoin grounds to a halt for too long a time.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:27:08
Buttcoiners are also banned. So this is what buttcoiners did, they created a new sub called rbtc and are now desperately trying to coerce [bitcoin futures]( into becoming [their own shitcoin futures](
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:35:58
same here
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:38:34
So altcoiners, buttcoiners and miners, which is what rbtc consists of, have the same priorities as bitcoin holders? So they're all ''good intentions'' and yet still claim to have an economic majority when the futures markets hates their coin? So they're ''in good faith'' ''going to wait 48 hours'' to see which ''chain has most accumulated difficulty'' to decide which gets the bitcoin ticker? Because yeah, that's all bitcoin is apparently to this altcoiner vector of attack, a mine or two in China.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:54:43
Bizcoin2X futures are in the shitter on all the exchanges. Hash power never held any bitcoin in the first place. You don't have any business, let alone, economic support or majority, but I like the way you're now twisting words and what was before economic majority is now merely 'business' majority lol.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:49:29
Not at all. people will be crashing the 2x price even harder than the futures have already done. And 1x will just be waiting for miners to become rational again. 
See this is why you lot are all are shitcoin altcoiners. Because you're trying to insult bitcoin, you're trying to say bitcoin consensus is only a 48 hour window where the market does what the miners want.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:32:56


Then why are the miners at rbtc so afraid of all the futures that show bizcoin2x to be trading at 10% of 'corecoin'?
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:17:20


What the fuck you talking about? A centralized mining shithole in China that ''collaborates'' with Bitpay does not an economic majority make. 
You're an economic minority, after all these years of whining, you lot don't even have futures at 15% of ''core''coin futures, and that most exchanges with the most trading volume all fucking hate your chinacoin and have rejected it. You're so scared you can't even get DCG exchanges to list futures.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:23:22
Definition of a troll:
trying to scare and drag the market to a shitcoin which the market hates as it has said so in various futures markets, by taking advantage of how long it takes to adjust difficulty in bitcoin

Womyn want money equality, only, wait for it, wait for it, they don't. They'll always have superiority in the social sphere, the only way the cucked up race known as men can keep up is with money.
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:11:27
Fungibility, irreversibility and anonymity are not features women like in money. All their big political movements consist of the opposite of these traits, such as alimony, tender years doctrine, duluth model, feminine imperative, shit testing taken to a political sphere etc etc. They all consist of pendulum complaint clickbait journalism where the focus isn't on the philosophical consistency, but on the specialness of being a womyn. They all depend on the outgroup bias of men, and the ingroup bias of women, to keep at it, and all depend on the female superiority in networking and fake social interactions. It's like telling Stalin to go invest in dogecoin.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:27:59
Doesn't help you had ''stars'' like Craig Wright, Vitalik Buterin, Emin Gun Sirer, Stolfi and ofnumbers on your side does it.
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:46:01
They're risk averse because they're coddled from the cradle to the grave, and privileged beyond belief, which leads to their shit writing style, shit writing content and their perfect dominance in social media, social interactions and networking, and all the other garbage fake interactions of life. If they had their time up shit creek like men do, they would've been at the origins of cryptocurrency. But they prefer regulated cesspools like paypal, and other freezeable assets they can get in divorce proceedings. Lots of truth in Don Rickles jewellery jokes and Tim Allen's ''men have two choices, work or prison'' quotes...
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:39:20
Oh please, men don't love risk. That biologism reductionism passes at a rally where the mass is looking to belong to something. Real Men don't have another option, it's about survival not risk. Only mommy's boys and cucks love risk, and in that we can put both the ''feminists'' and the ''red pills''. And bitcoin is, or wasn't, about risk.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:41:47
Funnily enough, bizcoin2x is valued at 13% of the real bitcoin as the futures show, after years of whining from the Roger camp. Are you eagerly awaiting the rise of communism?
