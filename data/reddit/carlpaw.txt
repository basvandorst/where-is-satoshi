I got my funds today money gram actually fucked up my order not Bitinstant so sorry to Bitinstant but in the end I only got my funds quickly because I had been trying to contact them for I would suggest looking in the spam folder for an email for money gram or calling them from whereever you made the deposit I'm not saying Bitinstant didn't rip off anyone else but in my case they did alright and I'm sorry again

did you get a conformation from moneygram (make sure you cheek your spam) the reason I ask is that they messed my order up at Walmart and I had to go back and redo it

tomorrow will be day six for me I really don't want to lose my money but it's looking hopeless, at this point I'm more pissed at myself for not cheeking up more, needless to say I won't be going back to Bitinstant

how did you deposit the money?
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:16:52
wow guess I'm just one of the un-lucky ones after I made the deposit I read a bunch of post of people having the same problem as me I'll just keep trying to contact them then

I went there and the called money gram from the red phone because they were the ones who made the mistake if bitinstant already has your money than this won't help
