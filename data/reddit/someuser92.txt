I suppose you are right, in the long term.
But i think the volatility, even if it is a persistent deflation, presents some psychological barriers for the widespread adoption of Bitcoin.
I would be much happier to hold and use Bitcoins for normal stuff if the value of each coin was stable.
Right now, i just intend to hold until the value in $ becomes "large" :-/

If that were to happen, Bitcoin itself would go up in flame.
Active wallets would be just as vulnerable as forgotten ones.

Yes, my central idea is that the transaction history is available.
The recent (fx within 1 month) transactions will have a range of sizes, which can be represented as a discrete distribution. 
It is my postulate that the mean of this distribution is a good measure of the actual value of each coin. Therefore, it should closely follow the exchange rate. 
In order to keep the mean constant, the supply of coins should be increased through awards to the miners, and decreased (slowly) through the transaction fees. 
Depending on the current trend, the transaction fees will be either destroyed or awarded to the miners.

And by the way, thank you for your input :-)

There is already a (voluntary) transaction fee on Bitcoin.
According to my best guestimate, the required mandatory transaction fees would be extremely small, &lt;0.05%, once there were more than 10000 transactions per month.
EDIT: I misunderstood your post. In the event of declining userbase, the value would of course drop, just like with Bitcoin. However, in response to the smaller userbase, the transaction fees would increase, the money supply would eventually shrink, and the price of each coin would normalize to its intended value.

You really need to implement this ASAP.
It would take a great idea to the next level.

Thank you, that is a very interesting perspective on it.

By the way, thank you for taking the time to respond :-)
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:44:56
Thanks, i will look into it.

I dont think my proposed system would be inherently inflationary, once there were enough users. The supply of money would increase in order to keep the mean of the distribution of "recent" transaction sizes constant.
If the number of users fell, the transaction fee would increase, and the supply would fall, keeping the "value" constant.
EDIT: changed "deflationary" to the intended "inflationary"

From what i can see, Freicoin i completely different from what i am proposing. In my idea, there would not be a tax for holding the money, but rather a negligible transaction fee to make deliberate attacks on the transaction history unprofitable.
I am proposing a system with the intended property that the value of each coin should stay constant, instead of appreciating (like Bitcoin has been doing) or depreciating (like normal currencies).
EDIT: Thank you for your critique. After reading a bit more about Freicoin, i can see that my idea has nothing in common with it, and that Freicoin seems a bit too idealistic to gain traction.

Yeah, maybe.
I was just thinking that the attraction of Bitcoin was the lack of government interference, the low transaction fees, and the inherent transnationality.
Besides, Bitcoin does not seem very stable to me.
For example, I just bought 50 dollars worth, and i am very disinclined to spend them on anything ordinary, since i expect their value to increase.
My feelings about the cash in my hand is exact opposite. I can spend them freely, knowing that their value will be approximately the same tomorrow. 
To me, this seems like a quality of a healthy medium of exchange.
