Yes, and at almost the same time as you. Over the last week, I just stopped checking my Blockfolio all the time and now I'm down to once in the morning and once at night. I put money in when I have some to play around with. The end. I got so into it over the last month or two that I need to take a step back and focus on real life for a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:08:11
I'm likely missing a big piece of the puzzle but why would anyone, whale or small fish, go through Tether intermediary which seems kind of sketchy, instead of just transacting with BTC/ETH or whatever directly?
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:29:33
Thank you for your post. On one hand I am very glad BTC is reaching the mainstream and may get some practical use sooner rather than later, but on the other hand I'm disappointed it's seen as just a get rich quick scheme for most people coming into the community. I kind of miss the times when it was this adventurous new tech and people were talking about the ideas and principles behind it, not just how much cash they are making or losing.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:16:16
But the Dow Jones is an index of companies with actual real world use, value and purpose. What would be the purpose of Bitcoin if it just accumulates or holds value but doesn't have any practical use? It would be useless as an index. 3 months ago I would have said if Bitcoin falls the whole crypto world falls with it. Now? Not so much...
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:30:06
It's clearly more of a PR stunt and not really a sign of mass adoption (at least not right now), but it's entertaining nonetheless. I have to say their marketing team is quite original.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:21:53
I think they ripped that from The Globe and Mail in Canada.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:20:21
I get that development of BTC was following a long-term road-map for crypto/blockchain adoption that would take several years to come to fruition, but the recent mainstream boom has put a fast-track on everything. People are now looking at this tech for some tangible uses in the coming 5 years, not in 10 years +. If BTC is not ready to meet that challenge, it will be surpassed by another coin that can. Not trying to instill fear (I will continue holding BTC personally), just being realistic about the new marketplace challenges we face given the sudden rise in crypto popularity. It was a lot easier to HODL when we had the time to HODL and the mainstream didn't care about crypto. Now that even my grandma heard about BTC, 2018 should be about action and convincing people BTC will be ready for more practical use in the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:50:32
It's fine, I needed a bit of a breather. Good time to shore up my finances too.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:48:25
True, but I feel like BTC is trading off the two most important aspects of currency, transaction speed and cost.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:22:51
Competition is good. Coinbase has no choice but to lower their fees now.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:55:49
Fuck yes give me some time to shore up my finances and come up with another big sum to invest lol. Hate it when my money is tied up during big dips.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:28:03
Can someone shill me on why Bitcoin will actually be used as a currency and not usurped by one of the new, more technically capable kids on the block? These high fees and high processing times are killing my optimism. I need to believe again. Disclaimer: I have my eggs in several baskets, including BTC and alts.

Can someone ELI5 the high fees on Coinbase? I just wanted to take out like $100 worth of BTC to buy some Ripple but the fee is approx. $40? What gives?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:03:05
I don't want to sound like an elitist, but anyone else feel like the a less-sophisticated class of investors is flowing in from the recent boom? On one hand, I'm glad more and more people are finally hearing and talking about Bitcoin, but on the other hand the vast majority of recent buyers only see it as a get rich quick scheme. 9/10 buying into it do not give a shit about the technology itself, or learning about it. What are your impressions from people you know who bought into Bitcoin but are not tech minded?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:13:28
Honestly I hope it dips in the 11 or 12k range, the flash "crash" to 16k came and went way too fast, I want to buy some of that cheap BTC lol.

I'll HODL until I can pay off my entire student debt or if Bitcoin really blows up until I can pay off my entire mortgage. Cashing out and not having those financial pressures in the back of your head for years and years is worth it simply for the mental health benefits. Obviously, after you just restart buying into Bitcoin :p

Hey, some religions were built on kookier ideas...
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:41:41
I'm a strong HODLER but I admit that big debts like student loans and mortgages are worth cutting off from your life if you have the chance. Bitcoin may crash and burn tomorrow or it may soar to new levels, but in the end you are debt free right now, and that's worth it just for your long-term psychological health.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:14:46
I'm with you except for the Bitcoin Jesus and Bitcoin Judas parts. I know we say stuff like that for fun on this sub, but for a business news network it sounds kind of childish and borderline fanatical.

Sounds like something I would post on Myspace after buying my first .001 BTC in highschool.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:32:37
I don't hate them, I clearly said it's good more mainstream people are joining, I'm just afraid it fuels the whole bubble and wild speculation with no basis narrative. People are just buying into it to make money, not because they believe in the technology. That's kind of dangerous for long-term health.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:44:05
2017 is the year where the mass market starts hearing about Bitcoin because of how fast it can make money.
2018 is the year where the mass market begins to understand how Bitcoin is not just a get rich quick scheme, but a revolutionary decentralized digital currency that can transform and improve our economic system.
Am I too optimistic?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:54:44
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own. It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though."

The fact that we are still talking about this transaction years later makes it historic. That's more than what most of us will accomplish in our lifetimes. If it weren't for those early transactions showing it was a fairly viable payment method, there would be no Bitcoin today.

@_date: 2017-11-14 14:18:38
1) Don't take investing advice from random internet strangers, no matter how knowledgeable they seem to be. No one can predict the market and no one really knows what will happen long term (hell, even short term). Be ready to lose all the money you put in crypto. The only advice I care about is keep buying, HODL and don't panic when there's major volatility.
2) Don't stress about big dips or losing hundreds of dollars. Some people go down tens or hundreds of thousands on dips. Build a tougher skin and see it as a buying opportunity.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:04:07

Pay off your student loan and keep buying BTC with the extra cash you'll have on hand. I'm a HODLER but fuck debt, the peace of mind of not owing anything to anyone is worth it imo.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:12:35
Welcome to trading, whether it's crypto or stocks. There will always be bull runs and big dips, sometimes you will win a lot sometimes you will lose a lot, so don't kill yourself at every missed opportunity. You will go crazy if you always tell yourself you should have invested more or sold at the right time, because everything always seems so obvious in hindsight. Just diversify and HODL. Never go all in on one asset and don't assume you can predict the market. If you don't panic at every bit of news and keep cool during volatility, chances are that you will make a decent amount of money in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:37:54

I may not have explained myself clearly but I meant it doesn't matter if they are true or not, they were either dropped or not proven in court, which is all that matters in terms of sentencing. His sentence for what he was found guilty of is not proportionate.

I totally agree with this and imo it's one of the reasons the show went from excellent to just good. Sometimes he goes way too hard on the liberal/left wing/millennial perspective and tries way too hard to diss any opposing views. And I say this as a liberal left wing millennial. He just feeds into a narrative many of us already subscribe to without bringing any new arguments into our bubbles. It just reinforces the echo chamber.
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:45:25
Even IF the hitman allegations are true (it was removed as a charge btw), his sentence is completely disproportionate to the crime. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:27:03
I think you missed the point. I still agree with most of what Oliver says. That's the thing though, many times he doesn't challenge the narrative or bring in new points of view. He just pushes the typical liberal/left wing/millennial perspective really hard because that's the audience. It's just an echo chamber that makes fun of the other side, as usual. I prefer someone like Bill Maher who can at least go against established dogma from time to time.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:19:38
None of the people he allegedly wanted to kill even exist.

A lot of alts are valuable and are building fantastic projects, but I agree, most of them need to be cleansed. 2018 will just be a general cleansing of the alt world...we'll quickly see which ones are reaching their white paper goals and forming partnerships, and which ones aren't.
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:57:30
No, just HODL. You can technically pull it off if you time the market and buy high and there's a crash next week where you can buy back in low, but it's obvious you have no trading experience so just wait it out, and trying to constantly time the market is a foolish strategy for the long-term.

I used to work at Parliament and that's a gorgeous room you'll be in FYI. A lot of young MPs in the Finance committee, so they may be more receptive to crypto and blockchain.

Will watch it later, thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:24:38
Pretty much this. The crazy bull run last fall kind of pushed crypto way ahead of schedule in terms of mainstream consciousness and acceptance. The idea was to get there AFTER LN and other technologies that make it a more practical payment method mature. It needs to catch up, which will happen in due time. These big online companies are only waiting, watching and positioning themselves behind the scenes and from an R&amp;D level, that's all. I'm betting they all want to be the first one to pioneer crypto purchases too. When one of them offers it, they'll all jump on board.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:11:14
Shit I'm hoping for another WSJ or CNBC smear article so the dip sustains...I'm like 48h from my money transfer lol.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:39:27
Of course the big bank exec will drum up fear about a currency that allows you to largely bypass banks. It's completely against his interests for crypto to take off, and he probably envisions a scenario where someone can do most of his day to day transactions without a bank. His comments makes me think he's more worried about the future than anything.

Can someone ELI5 how this relates to BTC specifically?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:12:12
Yes but you could say the same thing about AOL or Yahoo in the 90s. Not saying BTC won't keep up (I own some myself so I hope it does), but name recognition can drop very fast within only a few months, especially in the tech world. Don't rely on popularity as a reason for why BTC will come out intact.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:42:26
Yup, you're right. I'll be buying some Bitcoin and Etherium in the next few days. Great time to buy.

@_date: 2018-02-13 15:57:27
Well there's a fundamental shift in consumer acceptance and mainstream adoption that simply did not exist in 2013. The point is to make BTC technologically viable for the mass market...and it's slowly getting there. It was never going to be accomplished in 2017 anyway, bull run or not. The market conditions now compared to 2013 are very different...we are no longer talking about a niche technology (relatively speaking) and companies are no longer looking at it that way.
