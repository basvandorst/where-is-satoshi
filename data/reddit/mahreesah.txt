Is it just me or is CampBX acting up as well?

Finally, some excitement! I'd bought a few BTC right before the price went down, but...still fun to watch nonetheless.

Those last few "..." really instill faith in me. Hahaha.

It'd be cool if Bitinstant would allow payment to bitcoin online through a prepaid debit card. Anyone know if this is already possible via another service?

Your sarcasm is totally on point. I actually hadn't thought of how terribly wrong such a transaction could go (which was pretty stupid on my part), but I figured that this probably isn't a new idea, and that others may already have a somewhat safe way of doing this.

It does! Thank you.

Do you think SR's DDoS attacks significantly affected the market? I've heard mixed thoughts about its general impact on value. Some say that SR's users are only a small fraction of those who trade bitcoin; I honestly have no idea though.

I sure do hope CampBX is a registered money transmitter...otherwise I'm screwed.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:16:54
Ah crap. Already registered before I saw this. Thanks though!

I agree. The drastic changes in price makes my life exciting...sometimes not in a good way. I try not to invest too much of myself in it.
@_date: 2013-05-12 06:58:25
IT WORKED. SWEET JESUS. Thank you so much.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:41:51
Yep. Hopefully not for long.
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:34:48
This answer is my favorite.
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:23:50
There isn't, I actually just learned about CampBX. Would you recommend that as the best way to exchange?
