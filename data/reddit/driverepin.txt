@_date: 2017-12-20 02:48:25
we all knew that Coinbase was studying idea to offer BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:53:21
How you know that? Could you please link with this information. I really love Satoshi, such a brilliant man.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:21:46
Coinbase isn't good reference to BTC price
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:24:42
The question is, Can I already move my BTCs from my wallet or do I have to wait?
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:43:17
Of course there are owned solutions that you previously allows a third part manage your BTC in exchange for a fiat but BTC was not to replace the third part that manages all the money?
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:22:58
How much coins Satoshi has? And, how do you know he has unsold coins?

Namibia’s Central Bank said cryptocurrency exchanges are not allowed under the nation’s law. According to this same law, cryptocurrency cannot be accepted as payment for goods and services, the nation’s central bank has said.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:32:36
why it didn't happen in July? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:09:32
HAHAHA OMG are you new on bitcoin? there are still thousands of exchanges and they can trade to others digitals currencies and trade directly to buyers. This is not a problem at all
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:09:48
Many people buying BTC right now, swapping fiat for BTC

@_date: 2017-09-29 23:24:43
I still predict at least 15 days low at the end of October early november.

@_date: 2017-09-25 15:07:35
I checked 3 hours ago the BTC  volume over the last 24 hours and it was below 1 billion. Now it shows an increase of 133 million. While writing this post, this updated to 160 million more! 
Is someone gone shopping?

New gold is mined every day
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:21:01
I gave you the credit for this affirmation. Also, altcoins can full the gaps of BTC.

@_date: 2017-09-18 12:11:04
I think you are the one trolling here. Satoshi (accord to some) died hodling 1 million BTC
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:49:16
BTC market is less then 49%. more than 51% of the market is Altcoins. Dont underestimate the capalibity of them. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:14:54
That is the talk here. "So what?". I just suggested something. "option" maybe not the best solution. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:09:31
what you are saying is like, of the if the gold is lowering the amount, people will start to make rings and others jewels lower.
What I really think is that if gold start to lowering the amount, people will start to combining it with other materials (alt coins).
So, if nothing be done, Altcoins will be necessary to complete the necessary amount of coins to make it reliable. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:46:33
how 7-8mb blocks will transfer the control to miners and exchanges?

I constantly look at the trading volume of the last 24 hours. there are several sites that show estimates. I saw a rapid rise in volume followed by strong BTC high which suggests strong buy

"go get a life geek" works 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:59:36
altcoins are others blockchain coins. There are more then 2k different altcoins, go to Bittrex and check it alt
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:55:28
Google it 
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:39:11
That exact what people think. We know BTC system is safe as long you don't let others have access to your keys, there is no way to hack the system. BTC system is safe but LastPass and others Web solution isn't. Remember some of exchanged hacked....
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:11:43
If you would like to support low fee transaction on bitcoin blockchain, what you need to do is use a wallet that support SegWit nodes. 
Here is a list of them &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Use only wallets that support SegWit
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:12:33
Sure, I did a bad math, I agree but the issue is real. If you add not only those who died but those who lost the key or lost access to is PC (where the wallet where installed) you see ina big picture the problem. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:19:57
no, I did a comparison of prices first and last day of each month since the fork happened. Pure Math. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:24:33
It seems to be threatening to undo the gains of the day. This is rocking the trunk and about to knock the apple down. Last 2 hours stabilized next to the 4k. Will the BTC sustain???
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:34:00
I predict BTC falling a bit 2 to 1 week before the fork. After that the coin may grows very fast as some will invest to receive the gold coin (if Bath split) or not having others issues until January, free ride to invest on BTC, strong than ever.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:22:39
they say "this is corporations taking over" but they don't elaborate why it is corporations taking over.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:54:39
So these 1150  AltCoins is responsible for 51% for the marketcap? 
There are two possible outcomes:
01 - Altcoijns continue to gain market share and BTC does not grow as much.
02 - Altcoins are being forgotten over time and BTC (and maybe some other 10 coins) occupy the entire market
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:43:51
BCH will die next months. losing 5%/10% if value per month.
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:56:54
Usually gold is "hodled" in coffins, box, bank. But sure, some gold is lost eventually. But the amount of Gold is increasing by new mining
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:18:18
I say 5200 cause wee already saw how easy is to BTC to go to 4500. After China crises stabilize 4500 would be the new ground and from there to 5200 isn't too far. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:18:37
170 millions right now, in only 3 hours!
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:14:45
selling at 5k and buying again at 4500
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:36:38
So far this is what make BTC something so special. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:18:46
But before the split people withdraw BTC from exchange and hodl on wallets to get their new alt coin. Price will drop like July
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:54:37
not Trading volume but increase quick Trading volume in 2 hours

they will find a way to sell the surplus BTC they mine. We always find A WAY
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:55:09
I'm open to talk but if nothing be done maybe a fork with this improve is necessary. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:09:13
transfer your BTC to one exchange that support the SW2x
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:11:52
someone very happy and always smiling. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:30:57
same race that happened in July. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:39:05
welcome to the real game!
just to go Bittrex and buy some cheaper coins there and sell high. double your BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:15:26
nature accepts only the most adapted
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:08:37
So is this what is raising the price of BTC today?
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:21:14
In the near future China can influence and control the miners of its country (read threaten) to join any new update that it finds convenient.
It is not healthy for the BTC system that a country like China has so much control over mining. It would be healthier if mining was more branching and scattered around the world.
Now we see Russia trying to bring more miners to the country. What can be seen as another way to gain control and power the network.
The Core group needs to watch these movements, they may soon become irrelevant if the miners, following guidance from their country, choose the future to be taken.
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:14:17
I doubt it, since other cryptos are growing as well. It looks like a classic Fiat to crypto movement
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:20:28
Wall Street can wire others  
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:56:00
because it is the correct name 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:28:14
the alcons are very cheaper right now (buy in low and sell in high), BTC will suffer a correction this week
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:12:46
It going to stuck until the fork issue be solved. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:56:40
If Satoshi mined this first blocks. You may will never know his identity but at least are we able to know his first BTC adress? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:11:04
routine payments  is suspicious. The first flag will be the quantity and then the seasonality
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:22:56
There are already 400 altcoins based on blockchain,  if new altcoins to keep been created every month, no way BTC will hit not even 15k
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:19:56
I'm going to sell my BCH before it hit new historic low 
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:33:41
Are there many users of this wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:57:59
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:32:22
agreed, another july crisis is coming 
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:38:30
buy altcoins
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:12:08
mining is been painful. I don't think it will be updated after so many drops. BCH may works in the further as pump crap coin to Telegram channels 
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:33:29
SegWit2x 
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:23:12
I really doubt BTC will hit 4900 today or tomorrow, corrections always happens. It just stablish a new ground at 4500. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:04:20
BTC is faded to have forks. It's happens because there are too few BTC in circulation (and the number lower every day when people lost their keys or die) and every day more people interested in buy it. 
Fork is a way to "expand" the BTC or "evolve" it to something "better" but at very end, it's a way increase   Bitcoin (or BTC like coin) in the universe.
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:41:58
July crisis 
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:19:48
SW2x will be the main fork of BTC

Accord to you I'm a BOT from Russia, only your opinion matter.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:57:19
I dont think so, BTC is just the enter on concurrency world. After the enter, everyone start to make profit buying and selling altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:25:08
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:29:06

@_date: 2017-10-08 23:33:51
Sad when BTC surge and drag all altcons to low, but also good opportunity to buy them
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:50:52
I mean that poloniex will delay the transfer and users will not be able to withdraw on time. If in fact Poloniex has all the BTCs of all users
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:36:13
I still depositing and withdrawing in Poloniex, fee still low there 
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:34:19
foxbit issue, but now is fine
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:15:10
I think the last users to withdrawal money from poloniex before Aug 1st will have a sad surprise. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:00:48
Only the Tomahawks can work at this stage. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:36:00
not CoinBase. Foxbit
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:53:40
Buy it now is the most profitable option. As many mining are backing the chances, we will not see a split of the coin.
 The only unclear situation are the exchanges website, main places we use to buy BTC, many of the exchange website will be closed btwn July 31 and august 01 (or august 02) for precautions. The price tend to rise in the parallels channels and "black markets". After the exchange website return their activities, the price will go to the moon.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:16:10
Now I'm starting to think. How much BTC has gone with those who died? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:33:49
How can we die any day, it never occurred to you that your descendants need to know where the BTC's of the deceased are?
