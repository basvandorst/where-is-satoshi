If these little fluctuations are something stressing you out, this is probably not a good place for you.  Bitcoin's value is derived through pure demand.  There needs to be a whole lot of Bitcoin bought everyday to keep it at this price. And it's always different, so the price fluctuates with the current demand.  Point being, it has been a lot higher than this, and a lot lower.  If these short term ups and downs worry you, you might want to look into a savings account.  Bitcoin is clearly an asset that has no set price, so why would a little up and down scare you, you have to be aware this would still be considered a high risk investment no? Because this is going to keep going up and down, and watching the price move daily will make you pull your hair out.

Not necessarily.  I have never had enough money to buy and save Bitcoin.  But when I need $20, or $30 worth for a specific situation, i buy it.  The reason I use Bitcoin to register domains with name cheap as a far cheaper alternative to Godaddy, or use Bitcoin to save 20% on two coffees at starbucks everyday, or buy something on Amazon for a discount; all use cases with a significant benefit, that involve no speculation at all. Bitcoin provides a great benefit as an alternative in certain spending situations.

There's been a lot of good discussion.  My advice would be to contact the ATM providers directly and speak to them about their offerings. As for a lawyer, your best bet is going to be a lawyer that locally deals with the financial system.  You might have to search for it, I can't seem to find the thread,  but a while ago on Coin forum, there was a rather lengthy discussion about becoming a Bitcoin ATM operator and all the costs involved. Here's one way options  and your two way options 
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:36:58
Not actively marketing their company?  Have you searched their promotions?  They have given away more Bitcoin than the majority of businesses in this space to be honest.  You realize marketing comes in a variety of mediums, and it's usually targeted at specific demographics or regions.  I have seen these guys run more promotions for encouraging students to try Bitcoin than most.  IMO they most likely have a strategy behind the scenes and are following it opposed to flooding money out on un targeted and unfocused promotions. Social media strategy, search engine optimization, promotional incentives for opening a wallet, referral incentives, word of mouth generation, all marketing mediums that aren't as obvious as others but definitely generate a buzz.

The benefit of 20% off at Starbucks is one that doesn't get enough attention. Interested in Bitcoin or not, there is a massssive market of Starbucks coffee drinkers that would be more than willing to save $700+ a year.   This is a super easy way to raise someones eyebrows about Bitcoin even if they weren't interested in the technology previously.

There's quite a few websites in this space that compete to offer that information.  Most of the news outlets and Bitcoin related sites have how to guides and such.

Of course I can't.  I can't prove it's not you, or me, or anyone. That's a quite broad range. So why should a picture of who it might not be publish as a quarter of a newspaper page that hundreds of thousands are reading?  Would you feel comfortable waking up with your name and picture in the news paper for what is speculation with barely any grounding except a similar name? Probably not. And this man has already suggested his displeasure with it through raising legal fees for a lawsuit against newsweek last year ( so why would it be okay to publish it in a local paper, and what's different since then?

In order to have access to your Bitcoin you need to own the private key(s).  When you download a wallet, you will own the keys.  When you say, host a wallet online with certain services, sometimes they will own them...  
   
Likewise, it's always good to own a desktop, mobile, or physical wallet and once you are done buying your bitcoin on local bitcoins, or coinbase, get the receive address from your personal wallet, and send the coins you have bought to that address.  The reasoning, is because in a context of the Greek crises, when you have your currency held by in a service, if something bad happens with them, they are the ones in control of your finances, vs a desktop, phone or paper wallet for instance, where security and storage is 100% in your hands.

The benefit in this case would be availability. Coinbase is a service so when you are purchasing you might incur a processing fee.  Personally, I use Circle for quickness to purchase, but as a Canadian CAVirtex to deposit into my bank account, although there is quite high minimums, Quadriga is also a preferred option.  
   
Basically, when you are purchasing or selling to a fixed rate exchange, there is a good chance they are taking a processing fee, which if you are dealing with tiny amounts might be small, but after a long time, or large transactions will add up.   
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:08:03
Do you happen to have a website or blog?  A gret place to start might be a donation button.  Also, I find when you contribute to conversations with quality content on twitter and here, you will find an increase in tips.    
  
One thing you might want to try is Zapchain.  It's a great community focused on quality Bitcoin discussion.  We love tipping for your input, give it a try.  
    
Lastly, just have fun.  The less you focus on generating revenue and getting involved, I think the easier you will find opportunities.  
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:35:08
I used those as 3 basic examples, there is 000's more that appeal to different kinds of consumers or individuals that conduct monetary transactions often.  Bitcoin will always provide a benefit at point of sale.  Bitcoin's consumer benefits will always change, so don't advertise them? That would be like suggesting that the sale at Nike for 25% off shoes that only lasts this week shouldn't be advertised, which is not the right approach.  Consumers want to hear about personal benefit, and they will be receptive of it.  The sale ends in a few weeks, that is fine, for the time being, they used it for it's benefit.  
   
This is a fast paced ecosystem, things will always be changing and I do believe it is very pessimistic to assume that in the future, it might be different, so avoid sharing the current benefit all together. Grab a news paper, all those discounts, will be different in the future... In fact, with Canadians dropping dollar and increased costs of exports, clothing prices have risen as high as 25% in the recent weeks.  This mentality would suggest they should have never advertised clothing prices at the original value, because they might change in the future, which IMO is the wrong approach. 
   
People do need to be more conscious of money, you are correct. But what people should do, and how they actually choose to live their lives, are two different cases.  They are a whole lot more likely to consider the potential as a whole, if there is an on ramp that sparks their engagement initially.  And this on ramp in most cases isn't going to be approaching them with how flawed their dollar bills are, or the conspiracy behind them, it's going to be something that directly benefits their lifestyle, right now, today.

Depends what you use it for.  Coinbase seems to offer a lot more options for utility... While, I have always used Circle because once verified I can buy bitcoin in literally 10 seconds and access it from mobile or desktop. I think you can even by micro amounts from changetip now.  If anything, maybe I will send you 5 bucks worth if you can't find it.  Sometimes it takes a bit to get verified, but eventually when all that is overwith, it's super easy to purchase them at anytime.

IMO it's going to be hard to not centralize in some opinions. Some opinions in here are basically if there is any entity with an increased % of the market, it's centralized, which isn't really correct. And any time there is going to be a $ amount involved, of course there's always going to be someone with more capital devoted to the process. I think it's crazy for someone to believe that a person with 10$ should be able to mine like someone who has devoted 1000$ to it. Makes no sense. People are always going to be inclined to mine.  And with that comes investment. And when you have the warehouse set up, cooling systems, location, it becomes easier to acquire more equipment at a lower cost.  Economies of scope, they are all around us!  Pretty inevitable.

Cool, great choice! That wallet is very highly rated in this community. If you are looking to browse features and such [Bitcoin Wallets]( is a list we've been working on.  You can use the sidebar "Bitcoin wallet features" to filter between security features and general utilities such as owning your private keys.  Feel free to browse, there is a lot of innovation in this space and lots of them offer unique functionality. For instance, I use Copay, because it allows me to have up to 15 multisignature accounts, meaning, I can have 15 parties that need to verify before anything is sent from the wallet, although I only use 2!

I would argue that the best way to educate someone is face to face with direct conversation leaving no stones unturned.

@_date: 2015-08-09 02:00:02
Getting everyone in the world to use Bitcoin is going to take a lot more innovation and an extended time period for people to learn and services to offer easier entry.  The barriers are still quite high, but a good judge would be the members in here, the google searches, transactions per day, volume of transactions per day, wallets being opened.   
  
Think of it as bringing a technology to market... there will always be early adopters, but sometimes the product is over the heads of most when it comes to daily usability. Takes time for technology to find a place in the hands of everyone for daily use.  
  
And as a currency, that uses a flawed financial system as a way to bring awareness, well 99% of the world has no idea how the monetary system they use everyday works behind the scenes and all of the inefficiencies involved.   
   
Time, that's all we can give it!  The world is a big big big place with lots of people.

Depending on where you are there is usually a fixed rate exchange that is easy, and once you have connected a bank account or card a few clicks each time and you're good to go.... CoinJar, Circle, Coinbase, BitQuick, TruCoin, all super simple to use. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:38:38
I am feeling that services and the core developers kind of have to be in the same loop in regards to what is necessary and what is needed... With open communication I think that service developers could work in light of the ecosystem and provide wallets and such that maybe work with a variable fee that changes based on the current blockchain demands?  
  
This whole discussion is super beneficial, but IMO it looks like a number of fragmented ideas that come from a number of people suggesting in light of their expertise.  It would be great to start with a list of fundamental considerations from the core devs with every opinion, all outlining the potential positives and negatives...  Followed by input from economic professionals based on the suggestions and of course main service providers, to see if we can manipulate some of these ideas to work in light of everyone.  
   
Anyhow, regardless, this isn't even a discussion in the central banking ecosystem, so in nature, these discussions are super positive regardless of how far we have moved since they have started.

It would be cool to see adopt some sort of system similar to BTCJam or Bitlending club where buyers and sellers have a COMPREHENSIVE credit system, that allows them to link profiles (bank accounts, personal profiles, basically accounts that require some sort of accountability) and ups their classification based on profile associations and previous trades, something like a5, b5, c4, etc...  Perhaps even a onename, or bitrated partnership....  This would be huge for protecting buyers and sellers and it would be the first listing exchange that had a review system that basically adds accountability to your profile. I think there is still too much of a disconnect between a quick star rating system and trusting someone with a few hundred to thousands of dollars.

Couldn't agree more.  Have had numerous conversations, as of yet, seen him consider any opinion other than his own direct approach to how everything should be done.  Kind of... contradictory to this whole concept.

There's a lot of smart people here, with butting ideologies, but the same end goals.  at some point, compromise is going to have to encompass a number of the avenues that are being discussed for a reasonable result.

It's called personal accountability at some point, we have to take ownership of our decisions, OP did, you don't seem to understand the process.  Not going to bother explaining it to you, pretty easy.  Not marketing's fault either. "extracts profits"  "clearly targeted at neophyte traders" "brazen"... Nice vocab by the way, considered writing a fictional Bitcoin novel?  
   
And I am not going to guess at how much paxful has made, directly related to two reddit posts, but, since you are quite sure, please, break down for us the business acquired directly related to this promotion, the revenue generated and what margin was their income, factually related to their marketing targeting neophyte traders.

Hey, we have been working to break payment platforms down by options, features and ecommerce platforms here -   (Also can filter in the sidebar)
   
there's a few options depending upon your needs.  Bitpay seems to be good, I always have used CoinPayments, but lots prefer Payza and Stripe for the ability to also accept credit cards.  Also, recurring payments which is huge depending upon your business.
  
  
GoURL has a few cool features such as locking / unlocking content and membership fee charges and whole bunch more.  
   
Coinkite allows you to create an easy button with a few clicks.... Just set up the donate button in our footer in about 1 minute.  They offer a number of buttons for pay now, and they don't require users to sign up to pay.
   
Here's 9 POS plugins that cater to wordpress -   
   
Are you going to be running woocommerce?

How long have you been waiting for the 15%?     
   


   
That sucks, but as a seller aren't you aware of the timeframe for buying? I haven't used Purse yet, but I would imagine if I was selling to them, their policy would be outlined in regards to how long the buyer has to cancel items... I think this one was a personal decision, at least it sounds like it.  Purse didn't force you to repurchase Bitcoin did they?
      
  


   
Purse is a third party service, they are paying taxes and conducting transactions, which would mean they would either have to pay tax, or cover it out of their pockets... Sales tax isn't that big of a surprise.  Mind sharing the items you were purchasing that Amazon doesn't tax, yet purse.io still does?  Just curious so i can take a peek myself.
And why would the FBI kick your door in for online shopping for legitimate items?  
  
  
Your name is a little out there. You might get more reception from the community if you weren't so confrontational..... or provide actual evidence to your issues.... As well, if a customer is having such hardships, I am sure the businesses goal isn't to solely fuck you over, most likely provide some sort of a benefit to the users... Have you discussed the specifics with Purse, and gone through the issues... or have you contacted support at all?  
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:25:46
The exact same way they would and can change tax rates on fiat.  Plenty of what ifs right?
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:19:38
Zapchain is a great alternative.  
And Reddit is a dying one.  I would love to see a voting platform that required a reason behind the votes. I suggest Zapchain, a place with far superior quality articles and discussion, and someone downvotes without a reason or response why.  A one click down and up vote system is a false way to judge quality.  If you're going to downvote something suggest why, because that click doesn't say shit.

So what you are saying... is they are still going to mess around, even though there is a transparent ledger of their activities?  
  
Haha I like the analogy. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:09:33
Fair enough, just regurgitating what I asked them. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:32:03
I think a quick purchase mobile app would be great. I saw below that you have been working on mobile version, but I think to a lot of people there is something more tangible about an app.  The majority of my sites traffic is now mobile, I am sure you guys are getting pretty close to that as well.... Something that makes it insanely easy to buy bitcoin, very simple, very very simple.  A Bitquick wallet, or partnership with a wallet provider for quick integration would be cool.  
   
I think eventually, when more people join the community, they will gravitate to the quickest methods of buying bitcoin.  Since you need a wallet to hold your Bitcoin i think the vertical integration will be essential in the future.  I personally know I get spanked by circle every time I purchase, but I don't mind because it's insanely quick, basically takes no time at all to purchase, and I really think if Bitcoin ever takes off people will want to acquire it without downloading a wallet and then heading over to an exchange to purchase.  I know lots of us don't mind, but the average joe wants 0 barriers to entry and two steps is just too much for some people.  
    
Also, this might not be possible at all, because of security and such, but I have been waiting for someone to come out with an API or plugin that can be embedded on websites such as ours (enjoybitcoins) that allows people to buy Bitcoin right off the site.  Instead of a banner or a referral, if someone could embed a plugin or script that would drop a BitQuick button that would pop up a buy bitcoin box right on the embedded site that refers to an exchanger, that would be badass, remove a few clicks and such.  Just a thought, probably not possible but thought I would ask. I think this would be especially cool for merchants accepting Bitcoin.   
      
  
~~Maybe a live average time indicator from the time of payment sent to bitcoins received to encourage and interest people that you are a fast way to purchase Bitcoin...~~   
    
As for payment options, I tend to see SEPA, SOFORT, Neteller, Bank Wire, Interac (canada), quite a bit. Will poke around your site and see if anything else comes to mind. 
   
Also, this has nothing to do with features, but a lifestyle marketing aspect to the website that encourages new adopters.  I think bitcoin exchanges tend to all focus on the same crowed, minus coinbase for the most part.  The exchange that can notify people of why bitcoin is important, and how it appeals to a specific demographic, and what their benefits are going to be is going to win the race. In my mind, the biggest market to focus on is the bitcoin users of tomorrow, and many exchanges, the people who are providing bitcoin to us, don't really have a message that appeals to the average joe, or lets them know why, in their context, bitcoin will benefit their lifestyle.    
     
Affiliates - Never been able to find out how to access my affiliate balance or dashboard, just something I thought was confusing kind of, and since I signed up, crashed my computer with the old wallet address, it would be cool to be able to change that.

Everyday.  If anyone is in the same boat, it was something that I really never bothered to understand until I was here.  I think the decentralized aspect, and the transparency of the block chain are really showing people and shedding light on the fact that we are using an extremely flawed traditional monetary system, and there IS alternatives.   
   
   
As a Calgarian watching the heat of an oil industry decline, speaking with my associates in the trades, there is one industry, and one industry only that is not calling for discounts, re-quotes or cancelling to their expensive renovations and building reconstruction, and that my friends is the financial sector, specifically banking organizations in the downtown core.

@_date: 2015-07-15 17:54:18


   
That's a point I have been trying to make. People don't want bitcoin if they can't buy it. People also don't want it if they cant use it.  People won't buy it if the barriers to entry are to high and there is no place to learn.  Businesses won't accept it if people don't use it. Businesses won't suggest to use it if there is no way for clients to benefit, learn or get it. It's a revolving circle that needs to grow all branches in accordance with eachother, or it wont grow.  
   
Just throwing ideas out there.  This will remain fragmented in Calgary until a few of us partner up and work on each area towards a common goal.

Hmm.  I see the incentive for releasing information, but IMO this information should b made open to the public for free. 283 people and 15 crew members lost their lives. There is families grieving, and if there is information that has been uncovered, the public deserves to know without paying 10 million.
@_date: 2015-07-11 22:42:07
Basically, after you have confirmed your bank account with an exchange service or fixed rate bitcoin provider it will be super easy to go baack and forth.  It usually takes a day to get everything sorted out, but once you are up and running, you will be good to go. Try to keep coins out of service wallets as much as possible for your own safety and do some research on best practices for security!

Thanks for the response.  I wish you well with the conference.  Would love to speak more in depth one day if you have a minute or two to chat.  I would love to bring Calgary a Bitcoin conference, it would be nice to speak with someone who has a track record in the industry and has planned such events before.  
Love the idea of free consultations, I guess it's nearly a fixed cost for marketing when educating and bringing people into the ecosystem if your time is already accounted for being present at the kiosk.  
   
Hope the conference goes as planned, best wishes.  I run enjoybitcoins, we have a decent social media following, let me know if you want us to give a shout out or share your conference dates to our followers, or anything really!

Very cool to see.  Do you see a consistent rise in adoption / interest?  And is this something that might have a feasible bottom line for the current operators? Just kind of curious if the revenue is based more on consultations or trading.  Would love to do something like this in my community, but rent is out of the roof not sure if it's possible at the moment in Calgary, very small movement, but I guess that is an opportunity for growth.  Tough to put together financial estimates when adoption is all over the place. Would love to hear any ideas or thoughts on how the plan was laid out.

I think customers using bitcoin will come with time.  As aa few ways to accelerate users, what about offering some incentives or promotions for people who consider using it? a few ideas off the top of my head Bitcoin nights to educate visitors that are interested or something on those lines?  Hold Bitcoin clubs or meetups there, maybe make it a safe zone for local buyers and sellers?  Perhaps a shop miner or node with some cool displays for people to see to spark the interest?  A unique Bitcoin drink that can only be bought with Bitcoin or some sort of discount or prize for people using Bitcoin, weekly 10$ wallet giveaway where Bitcoin purchasers get a QR code it might be a few cents or the chance of 10 bucks (1 in every20 qr codes or w.e number).

What are you referring to "You get what you pay for".... the resolution for leaving a financial account with funds inside for it for 6 months without a transaction, is having the service confiscate them and hold them until the user requests them back... Really?

Here's a list of exchanges catering to GBP currency trades-    
   
In the side filter, you can adjust depending upon creditcard, linked bank accounts, credit unions, cash etc etc.   
   
One obstacle i ran into, is that I purchase from an American exchange, but as a canadian cannot withdraw.  Make sure to double check everything before getting started... I still use Circle to buy and another exchange to withdraw, it works great once everything is set up.   
  
Few tips, before any decisions do a google search for a history of the business and if you are planning to do any questionable purchases, certain exchanges/wallets will lock your account, just something to consider.   
   
Also, it's good practice to have a desktop, mobile or physical wallet that you can withdraw to once done trading on an exchange.  While you currency is stored in a service wallet it's up to their security and trust measures, opposed to your own with a personal wallet.  
  
You don't own the Bitcoin unless you are in control of the private keys.   
And make sure to learn about proper security measures, if 2FA is available use it, use very comprehensive passwords, multi sig is a great feature and always keep a backup.

Woah!  That's huge.  What was your reasoning behind losing 30k of revenue a year? The way they approached the situation, and you have enough business without them?   That's putting a foot down if i have ever heard it. But i mean depending upon payment processors, that could be a pretty chunk out of your pocket to processing fees so maybe it was worth it?  Not sure what you do, but hope business is going well. Wish one day to be an entrepreneur myself. Hasn't gone very well as of yet lol
@_date: 2015-07-19 07:09:54
where are you?  I thought it was a problem with your platform a month ago?  Thought that was cleared up?  Thought I was wrong for calling you out?  Seems as though your team owes a lot of people a lot of money.
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:22:18
I believe that nobody is genuinely interested who does not have the correct information.   
For instance, if you approach someone saying, Bitcoin is decentralized money, nobody really cares, it seems tin foil hat.  Likewise, the bank is a service, you can control your own account with Bitcoin, not to many people care, they don't understand the monetary system, and typically don't want to learn about the details, or believe their government wouldn't do that to them.  A transparent ledger, to complicated for the average person. They don't want to think about what happens behind the scenes, it's not something everyone wants to understand....  
   
  
Now, apply it to their life.   Hey man, I see you drink starbucks alot, you know, if you load your Starbucks card with Bitcoin, you could save a buck on every coffee, that's 700$ a year at your rate.... Did I mention it's super easy, here's how you do it.   
   
Hey, you shop on Amazon quite a bit. You could buy 25% more stuff if you used Bitcoin to purchase your Amazon goods, it lets you choose your own discount... Good thing you are in the states, lets set you up it will only take 10 minutes, let me walk you through it here.  
    
I see you guys are having trouble with the costly fees at point of sale... Chargebacks suck, but we can bring that number to 0 if you let me walk you through a Bitcoin point of sale button, it will only take a moment and I can get you started in the right direction.   
    
People are not interested because they lack a lifestyle message that doesn't come off as propaganda.  They want to hear how it applies to their life directly, and how it's going to be a direct benefit to their person.  Not everyone is genuinely interested in a product / service until a message that appeals to their day is presented.  They need an on ramp that enhances their life, then they will start to take notice of how financial systems work.

Since you already found a way to buy the coins, you could purchase them and just send them to the persons wallet via your wallet. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:12:10
Awesome!  I think no matter, there is resources required, time for sure, but eventually somehow tangibly putting Bitcoin in peoples hands, but eventually a few bucks.  
  
Without any capital off the top of my head, Kijiji, craiglist, backpage,  r/calgary, perhaps a few local bloggers, vlogs, maybe a partnership or co promotion with a local magazine or Metro, local press release, free bullition boards at schools &amp; surrounding businesses ....... but I think a big thing would be having one of these nights dedicated to educating vendors on the benefits of accepting it.     
  
Since the ATM is in the Cafe, and so are the meetings, seems like a good starting point for canvasing around other small business within the area to come out to the vendor night.  I like getting vendors on board, because they have the ability to generate lots of traffic and can all extend to a different demographic at once, for a low cost.    
    
   
I think once the word get a little traction in Calgary it would be good to get the ATM owners, and small businesses around town accepting Bitcoin to consider financial assistance (all with projected investment / benefit of course) directly handed out promotional material (bitcoin focused, shares ATM locations, and where Bitcoin is useable in Calgary, meetup dates etc. a community guide basically)  promotional flyers / brochures etc..... There's always going to be the "didn't it crash" "isn't it used for bad things", so a person to speak directly is a great way to kill the myths and emphasis benefits. Also, people want to know it's usable, so showing a place to purchase it, the places to use it, that there is an active community to learn and get involved, will interest people instead of the fragmented image where people have to google and search directories for hours to find somewhere to use them.    
  
Here, Bitcoin is an idea, and fake money to most, until they have something tangible to take home that shows them direct benefits that apply to their life, in a lifestyle message.   Flyers, not very expensive, but they do cost something... Perhaps a local print shop considering accepting bitcoin would be a help if we approached them and dedicated a spot for their logo.
  
Supported by some super cheap guerrilla marketing in the form of street art perhaps, creatively placed stickers, basically anything depending upon who the focus is on, lots to work with around the core of Calgary, have a few ideas written down that emphasis specific benefits depending upon the target audience, and of course the free channels mentioned above, kijiji, craiglist, local forums like beyond, maybe a 5$ facebook targeted ad the day prior to meetups. Bitcoin clubs at the U of C, MT Royal, Sait would also be great partners for speakers at meetups, topics and spreading the word... if they exist. 
     
Just a few ideas off the top of my head.  I see a fragmented image in most communities, and IMO the community needs to grow as a whole, ATM's, places to spend, events... all together.  It might even be a good idea to see if we could get a little team of 5 going for promotional motivations, each person with a specific task say, one group focused on vendors and businesses, one group focused on connecting with individuals related to industries that will be using Bitcoin tomorrow, another focused on the meetups and events,  and another on partnerships, marketing online and bringing it all together. Just an idea to distribute tasks so nobody is overloaded.  
   
Right now I am unemployed so $$ is an issue, but I can donate lots of time and ideas.   
   
I am convinced that a flyer / brochure / take home is what people need to feel like Bitcoin is tangible, and well, real.   
  
Just a few ideas off the top of my head ***prior to morning coffee*** so they are probably all over the place forgive me, but I think there are a few Bitcoiners around here that would be willing to help donate their time or resources to the cause if there was a goals, a strategy and an estimate of how their contributed 100$ towards a batch of flyers will bring a return or traffic to their retail location. Heck, local Bitcoin's might be willing to assist for a logo front and center on a flyer.

Hey! So glad to hear, I hope you have a great experience. Please note that sometimes as of recent transactions are not confirming for quite some time so it might be recommended that clients pay with a wallet that allows them to adjust the fee.  
  
Check out the page above for some filters on POS systems.  Some allow recurring payments if that helps in your industry, or even credit card and debit transactions that might decrease fees from your traditional payment processors.

@_date: 2015-07-23 22:05:18
I think you have a point that will appeal to many outside of the picture. But there is always room for an alternative, and Bitcoin is the peer to peer aspect. In the context of your example, there's always going to be a niche that don't want to pay for a transaction with Visa and such, and you know, whatever the integration is, the big box companies will have a revenue stream.  I do agree they will probably do something on the lines of your example, but I will stick to Bitcoin, that allows for merchants to easily form a donation or payment button with a few lines of code that goes straight into their wallet, or a Bitcoin oriented payment provider that will most likely always be offering a lower transaction fee.  
  
I like the analogy though.  Just think there will always be room for alternatives. If anything, it's cool that Bitcoin is the alternative that is putting emphasis on the credit and banking industries to improve and progress.
@_date: 2015-07-17 02:39:17
I am downvoting this based on the other 1000 people who had to go through the same public process to redeem their own personal currency, and the others who still are out thousands of dollars, due to iGots inability to run an exchange....

Bitcoin is backed by true demand. What the people are willing to pay for a Bitcoin at the present time. I get so confused by people that say FIAT is backed by a government.  Yes, a government that can change it's value and influence any aspect at the drop of a policy or regulation at any time.  As long as someone is willing to pay xxxx for a Bitcoin, that's where it;s value lies.  Seems a lot more realistic to me.
@_date: 2015-07-31 00:01:24

Well, let me be the one to whip this out. If your best friend jumped off a bridge, would you also?  If they start limiting regular content in this sub, I'm out of here, and pretty sure there are a few others that would agree.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:35:59
Agreed...   


     
Needs to be segmented a bit more.  What industries are we focusing on.  Perhaps the Starbucks 20% off is a good idea to push considering that's a pretty big selling point for most, and an easy entry for obvious value.   I think it's super important to target specific industries, ie. Financial investment, economic focused industry, day traders, forex investors, small business tired of getting mangled by charge-backs, eCommerce based in calgary, perhaps news papers for donations, industries with lots of travel. But for any success, these people also need to be in an are where its tangibly feasible to use Bitcoin somewhere as well as purchase it. I think it's important to grow in context of community location for that reason. 
   
Same with vendors, if nobody is going to use it, they will stop accepting it. So area focus seems pretty important in a context of actual use case leading to adoption or want to learn.   
   
Absolutely, there needs to be drivers in the industry. It would be nice to get together one week and see if we can't build a little promotional team perhaps associate some tasks or planning to each to see if we can make some progress.  Some good ideas you have, have heard some others as well, bringing em all together would be great.

There is plenty of BS that gets posted in here.  Just wondering why the result would be to blacklist two websites solely focused on Bitcoin news.  Yes, half their content sucks, hence why there is a voting system on reddit.  Censoring select websites is probably not a proactive resolution.

Also agree.  I think r/bitcoin is doing gret on what it's supposed to do, but it is definitely not the best place for trusted news and information, there is room for a bitcoin bulliton board or something that people can refer to on a daily basis for important events / happenings minus the bs.  In regards to censoring r/bitcoin, I think that is just asking for trouble.

I am becoming a fan of wallets that allow you to hedge / peg currencies with Bitcoin and a number of other fiat currencies. Really allows users to move currency around based on the economic stability.  Only downfall is you are still trusting a service with your finances, but I do see it as an alternative to getting funds stuck in a bank that has locked you out.
@_date: 2015-07-19 06:49:25
Still confused as to the purpose of this bounty.  Yes, this is reddit.  It's incredibly easy to create throw away accounts, most likely, for a reason.  I think 10 Bitcoin is quite the motivation for people to put there time into something productive for the bitcoin community, like a solution to the debate...  People change accounts on here all the time, I would imagine most people reading this post have at least 1 other from the past, and there was probably a whole bunch contributing to the debate that have since switched, I am not sure if that means they are trying to manipulate the conversation.    
This is proof, that there were some people, who have switched accounts, or continue to use separate accounts, during the time-frame or life of this discussion.... I still see no way that this data proves accounts created specifically for manipulation, or targeted intentionally at this discussion, and it accuses a bunch of people based on a pretty loose correlation in some cases.    
Also you missed at least 4 accounts I have used in the recent months.  I go through accounts like it's nobody's business, but it still doesn't mean that I intentionally do that to manipulate this specific topic, it actually has nothing to with that, I just like to switch accounts quite often... Did before this discussion started, and will again in the future...

Another option would be to set them up under affiliate links, with an upfront fee perhaps?  This is something I have been considering recently but came across the same questions... Basically without charging an additional percentage fee, set up an affiliate link with BitPay for instance, and set their projects up with your affiliate code. Charge them on a time scale for setup and initial education, and if they do happen to process a number of transactions, the consulting will be reimbursed through affiliate earnings, without adding another % on top?  This of course dependent upon connecting them with a service that provides an affiliate program.  Thoughts? 
@_date: 2015-07-17 03:25:58

Please forgive me not sure which one's will be the fastest for you, you can use the sidebar to pick options for payment processors as well.

My favorite book ever.  Completely turned my marketing degree upside down.  Although I agree with 99% of the book, mr. Sharp did discount the value of loyalty programs quite a bit yes, but he did use examples that supported his main theories.  There was a lack of recognizing Airmiles, a tried and true loyalty program that definitely provides positive returns for a number of clients.  In fact, I have a friend who works between Shell's tech POS and consumers, and their numbers would strongly argue that Airmiles is a successful loyalty program.  There are a number of these programs in circulation and I do think they get a boost from this program in capturing that 60% of customers that might have been occasional / once a year purchasers into higher volume / regular purchasers.  Also think it depends upon the category description in regards to say, gas station, grocery shopping, or the brands providing the consumer goods ie Honda or Colgate etc.  I think they grow in very different contexts and consumer behavior in regards to purchasing brands at a store, or the actual brand itself should be looked at in more detail. 
    
I love that book to shreds, but I also believe he discounted a few ideas that have a proven track record in specific categories as noted above (a retailer brand or a shop that sells the goods vs a product brand). For example the decision process when choosing a local gas station on grocery store is going to be different than the way they consider the brand that creates their toothbrush or a pair of shoes. What I took away from it is, that people spend way to much time and money on establishing and promoting loyalty programs.  It changed the way I thought about loyalty programs, but I won't rule them out completely because of it.  
   
Pretty pumped to see someone name drop that book.  It really opened my eyes quite a bit.  The part where he discusses, there is no target market for I forget I think it was "strawberry icecream buyers" instead, considering them "ice cream buyers that buy strawberry ice-cream more frequently" completely changed the way I focus promotions and marketing material without discounting that large market of infrequent, but important customers.  
   
Still have about 30 pages to go. So much information in that book, I try to reread the chapters a few times.  Really loved it alot.  Especially the part about price promotions and the actual numbers needed to make it worth while.  eye opener to say the least, and a book every marketer should read at least 1 time!

And now backpage users are showing plenty of platforms business.  Are you getting mad at marketing that works to grow Bitcoin? Must hate that eh?    
People who hate on marketing need to get a grip, and realize, their life is surrounded by it, 100% of the day. 100%. Everything you basically look at is marketing.  Could be social marketing, could be a product in your house, still it's marketing. Where can you go without marketing? A desert.... perhaps under water.  Anyone could have posted the backpage effect, and inevitably it would have been marketing for whatever service users went to, so yeah, marketing or not, it's bringing people into the community.

As far as I am aware, 20% is the discount. And also, as far as I am aware, there has yet to be proof that this is financed through illegal operations.   
  
Is there some source or resource that is legitimate that you can suggest for myself to learn about the strategy at Fold?  I am open to reading it, and would not promote a discount if there was logical proof it was a scam.  Not a reddit comment, but a legitimate source or research... Also, your referral to this religious fanaticism is a little off.  I used to love skateboarding, I made a website, worked for a skate company, created a pinterest account, a twitter account, and did it every day almost all day.  Would you suggest that this is an unhealthy enjoyment?    
   
I believe that people tend to focus on their passions, and calling it blind religion is a little off.  People enjoy what Bitcoin does both from an ideological perspective, innovative perspective and lifestyle enhancement.  If someone is passionate about something, what is wrong with persueing activities around the subject, or if someone sees real world potential and opportunity, such as 20% off Starbucks, which is purchased by millions everyday, what is wrong with letting them know about a discount and getting reimbursed for your actions?   
  
And what is wrong with telling others about your passion?  Would you suggest all commercials, word of mouth, billboard, street art, is unhealthy religious fanatic behavior?  What about brand ambassadors walking the streets promoting a product, unhealthy?  Your  the one bringing religion into the picture.  I think you should focus on religions pushing their beliefs on others, before focusing on a subject some find passion in.  Marketing is going to always be around.

I mean, we could roll through an example of what ifs, there are a whole bunch, but I would imagine, that is not going to happen. But you are right in that context, in my mind, it's a lot easier for the central bank to manipulate inflation of fiat then the government completely rule out Bitcoin.

Nothing wrong with bringing a few people along, such as people using bitcoin and telling their social circles about it, if there is a clear issue with the main bitcoin forums, nothing is wrong with sharing that with associates who frequent them.  Wouldn't you agree?  Information needs to be communicated, you can't just assume everyone sees the same shit as you.

What FACT? That brands are switching their core offerings based on YOUR ASSUMPTIONS.  What evidence from inside these organizations can you use to prove the motivations of these businesses aligning with your assumptions? Get off your high horse buddy, clearly you are overlooking your bias.    


   
Evidence please?  Quantitative.  I feel like you're going to have trouble with this one, similar to the other personal assumptions you have provided above. There is plenty of public information to suggest there is a significantly greater user-base than a few hundred.  It's easy to find, and since you are such a statistician, go for it.     
    
I love when people provide a stat and draw conclusions that are completely based from personal opinion, assumption and bias.  You are judging a complete business model from a handful of basic events that an individual on the outside clearly knows nothing about.

I agree with everything you say except it's dying. I think a number of these brands got into the bitcoin space expecting exponentially quicker growth and larger volume.  Without volume, they are at a loss, and Bitcoin hasn't been a large enough market to sustain operations.  I think moving into fiat services that offer bitcoin is great for the organizations and btc adoption. I still see positives and think it's growing, but I also think that these businesses with millions of VC funding are basing their business models on higher usage rates and greater population than actually exists.

It is not illegal.  There is lots of websites that go through the legality region to region. USA - commodity. Canada - commodity. Commodities are legal. Bitcoin is legal.  If they persist, ask them to suggest where they have got the information that it is illegal, it doesn't exist. Ask them what people use cash for.  Ask them if people use cash for drugs or prostitution. Ask them if people use cash for other illicit purposes.  Now ask them if cash is illegal.  The activities people use value exchange systems for might or might not be illegal, it does not reflect on the medium of exchange as illegal because it facilitates these transactions. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:29:41
Clearly, the number of daily transactions and wallets.  Growing would suggest today, there are more than yesterday.  Can you point me to the statistics that suggest otherwise?  
    
Also, I do enjoy the handful of brands you have chosen, most likely due to their public funding or high profile startups....  One aspect you forgot to touch on is the nearly other 1000 brands supporting Bitcoin innovation with projects that solely rely on Bitcoin transactions as a business model.  Now, I would imagine if you took the value of a handful of these, we would have a debate. There has been plenty of growth, and plenty of well managed businesses in the Bitcoin space.  Have you thought about any of these? There are lots.  
   
Bitpay, coinbase, circle and changetip.... Those are 4 to start, you have a long list to go through.  As well, I would be surprised if you have discussed the LT motivations of these businesses, surely Changetip has integrated traditional currency as a means to expand, but also bring Bitcoin closer to the hands of those who have no motivation in using services that solely use Bitcoin, but once they have used it with what they are framiliar with, they might have some motivation to learn.  Everyone has a perspective, I just think you are really selective with your citations here, as clearly these are not the only organizations that are a. well funded or b. contributing to the value of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Really? Low cost remittances and global transfers are probably the  issue solved by Bitcoin.  When a user is transferred Bitcoin and returns it to their regional currency, where is this signified in BitPay's numbers?  I just can't see how that is accurate account of usage..... In fact, retail expenditures of Bitcoin signify what people are using Bitcoin for in a spending context.  There is a number of use cases including gambling that BitPay as a single payment processor would basically have no impact.  So, I mean you are suggesting judging the value of bitcoin as a currency is best stated by judging the operation of ONE business in the space? Give me a break saying that judging the numbers of one business suggests ANYTHING useful about Bitcoin as a whole. BTW, here's 58 other payment processors dealing with Bitcoin -   And, after the tally of all other payment processors coe in, one would need to account for businesses accepting Bitcoin directly without a payment processor in between.... Your estimates tell us about BitPays operations. We're talking Bitcoin, not one brand.

Fees = too high.  ATM's for the most part cater to people willing to pay a premium for cash / BTC transactions. These will become mainstream if Bitcoin does. If Bitcoin does not, I do not see Bitcoin ATM's.  First comes Bitcoin, then comes people wanting to buy Bitcoin. If there is no utility, people will not seek to purchase it. When Bitcoin finds more integrations into the real world, then potentially, but I see Bitcoin ATM's coming after, not being the popular thing that brings it mainstream.

Mind expanding on how placing a Bitcoin ATM in front of people without the demand for it will automatically make Bitcoin mainstream.  I imagine if you discussed this with the same same Bitcoin ATM operators I have, they would suggest it's quite hard to draw traffic and a large majority are basically paying for them to be there.

I just wished that if they were going to regulate Bitcoin as a financial system, or currency, they would legally recognize it as the same. As far as I am aware it's classification and the way they are regulating Bitcoin are two separate entities, yet subject to the same guidance. BS

People should google.  EMV has been around for ages, the USA is insanely behind in payment technology.  
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:04:47
No.  I'm employed for a payment processor.  The problem i see here, is spending Bitcoin on eCommerce, which as a complete guess, is the most practical spending environment at the moment.     
   
EMV cards are only protecting card-present transactions, so eCommerce is uneffected.   
   
The big change as of recent is in the US.  Merchants on oct. 1 will be forced into either upgrading to EMV capable terminals ($199 / per on the cheapest side).... If they do not upgrade, the vendor assumes the risk of fraudulent transactions, which in the USA I believe the moving average fraudulent transaction is $399.  So, if a merchant decides not to upgrade, it would probably bea poor decision... They might not experience a fraudulent transaction, but if they do, chances are, that vendor is responsible to cover the $399.  
    
The only way Bitcoin would solve this is completely replacing outdated terminals to avoid risk of liability.... But in my eyes, cutting off debit / credit transactions all together as a means to avoid liabilities, or upgrading terminals is a bad decision, as debit and credit make up a massive number of daily transactions for most businesses.   
   
Bitcoin could be a good alternative to add.

I kind of think it's dumb. Anytime someone is willing to burn $ like it's nothing makes no sense, but at least it brings awareness that it is possible. I don't see cash, debit, credit or any financial system working on one of good faith that someone wont abuse it so why should BTC be any different. If there is something that could back up the transaction system for days, it should be attended to.  Just calling it an attack isn't really a proactive answer, and asaking them to stop doesn't really change the fact that it is possible either. If it wasn't them, it will be someone else.

There's lots and lots of options - [Bitcoin Payment Processors](    
   
In Calgary I have seen people use BitPay and CoinPayments.  Most of the time it's a hosted checkout page on a tablet, but the mobile solutions work well too... Pocket POS is a Canadian hosted payment page and I believe coinkite is as well. Bitpay offers the ability for automatic deposits but they recently raised fees.  There's a shit ton of options, i think it depends what works best with your situation, but BB's don't offer many BTC solutions other than the Core wallet i believe.
