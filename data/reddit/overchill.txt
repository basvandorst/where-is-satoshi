Just wondering how you're so certain it's a scam.
Is it the low number of confirmed trades?
Pays via paypal?
The only feedback is from 4 months ago?
High minimum trade amount?
Very high price offer?
247 contact hours?
Is it all of these put together or am I missing something? I definitely wouldn't trade with this person anyway.

Thanks, I've been on this page before actually, didn't grasp what it was about from the intro.
Seems like a lot of these examples are just waiting for someone to implement them.
I asked this because recently the topic of "what would happen to your bitcoins if you died tomorrow" came up, it got me wondering could someone broadcast a transaction that if not cancelled by a certain date, bitcoins from an address would be sent, for example, to a charity or family member. Like a dead mans switch.

You shouldn't have to pay transaction fees twice, I'm asking these questions to figure out how much interaction is required to pay by bitcoin, to me the ideal way is to select a few items, they are added to a list on the screen and a qr code is displayed including the address and total cost in bitcoin. 
I get the feeling these machines don't do add up orders and each "vend" requires credit.
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:24:10
If I wanted 3 items, totaling £4.50, how do we agree on the price in bitcoin? 
Do I first tell the machine how much credit I want to add? If so, couldn't this be done by telling the machine what items I want?
What happens when I send too much bitcoin/credit and are left with 50p change that I can't spend?

You're right, the bitcoin network would reject the transaction if the address isn't valid.
[The probability that a mistyped address is accepted as being valid is 1 in 2^32, that is, approximately 1 in 4.29 billion.](
If you send to a valid address that you don't have the private key for, it's gone.

This implies the software already knows where they are buried, that maybe the creator knows where they all are and the rest of us have to find them. IMO, not a good analogy.
Going straight on to "So, you have some Bitcoin, now what can you do with it?" after mining makes it seem like the main way to get bitcoins is to mine. 
I know that's the only *real* way to get them, but for the average person they don't need to go anywhere near mining. I would have said something about exchanges first, people will probably waste time looking into mining to get some bitcoin.
I would have focused more on the decentralized aspect of Bitcoin, throwing this comment "Your Bitcoins are technically stored in the Bitcoin ledger, also known as the blockchain, which is stored on every computer world wide that is dedicated to Bitcoin mining" into a paragraph looks confusing, when it's the most important part of Bitcoin.


I don't know what you mean by Bitcoin wallet ID, is it the seed for a deterministic Bitcoin wallet? That's rather wallet specific, as far as I know no such thing exists in the satoshi client other than private/public keys, which no one is going to remember.
Something on the page made my browser really lag out with scrolling, I think it was those large (a little annoying) gifs.
An acceptable read, but to me creates more questions than answers.

That's why brainwallets are a bad idea.
Pick any word, send something to it's address and watch it disappear instantly.
I don't think you need a vast network, just a full node and some crafty programming. I suppose competing with others doing the same is something to consider.
Edit: I guess "brainwallets are a bad idea" is too broad for people to agree on.
Sure, you can generate a "probably secure" brainwallet, but computers are constantly trying to break them, so you better be confident your method and seed won't be guessed today or in the future.
I think people underestimate the computing power behind brute forcing brainwallets, and so I called them a bad idea.
[Someone posted on recently]( because they stored their funds on an address generated from a phrase with some letters replaced with numbers, he thought no computer would guess it, just over a month later a computer did.

Nope, the 0.0008 went to 13cbkpKW2DdhEUmeGC2h9HyxbBdtc7Wcth and there was a 0.0001 fee.
I got that address from the output scripts if you scroll down, each Bitcoin transaction can include multiple transactions (or something like that) and the one blockchain couldnt understand was the message announcing it as a stealth transaction. The second was the real transaction.
 It now appears blockchain.info has updated to now understand stealth address transactions, so it might make a little more sense.

Nice work, I used your service when you posted here before, it was quick and good service, but I didn't go back because it was just easier for me the next time I wanted to buy something to go through the steam payment as my details are already there.
I wonder about things like this, how do you lose money if the price goes up between the 3 days?
We've seen huge price volatility in a matter of hours, would your profits survive such events?  If not, what are you going to do when/if the next bubble comes around?
As for efficiency, I sell on localbitcoins, it's very quick and you can have money in your bank in minutes, but you pay for it.
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:11:27
Ok I'd love some correction on this, but this is how I *think* mining works.
Are you familiar with hashing and one-way encryption?
What miners have to do is figure out the "nonce" which is a string appended to the bundle of transactions that just so happens to change the hash so that it starts with a certain number of zeros, the number of zeros a hash has to start with is the difficulty.
[Check out the hash of this block, it starts with 16 zeros.](
It's pretty easy to find a nonce that produces a hash starting with one zero, but takes a lot of effort to find one starting with 16 zeros.
The difficulty is calculated based on network hashrate (and previous performance?) so that it's likely to find a block every 10 minutes.
I guess they are bundled together because there's so many transactions that the network couldn't keep up with itself and keep the blocks in order, (oh and each block hash includes the newest block and the hash of the previous block, or something like that, but it's all in order).
To hash every single transaction as it's own block would need a low difficulty, there would be many orphans (pretty sure orphans are blocks found by a miner but have already been found by someone else), and what about block reward? Miners could hash their own transactions and ignore other peoples if they got rewarded for hashing them.
The designer must have concluded hashing transactions in groups of 10 minutes solves a lot of problems.

I think you need to read some links from the sidebar and learn about Bitcoin.
Sure, you can create a Bitcoin wallet, but that doesn't mean you have any bitcoins.
If you want bitcoin you'll have to buy some at an exchange and send to your wallet, the amount of bitcoin you have will not change, but their value in dollars will.

I'm not an expert on cryptography but I know a little bit, I think we need more information than "Uses 128-bit encryption".
Does it use [asymmetric]( or [symmetric-key]( cryptography? 
I want end to end encryption where FreedomPop has zero knowledge of what's going on, if they did that they'd probably say so.
They can hype it up with marketing, but if there's any way FreedomPop can decrypt then it's useless, it sounds to me like a half assed attempt at encrypted communications so they can market it towards a certain group.

This is awesome.
Now turn it into a business model, there's so many directions this can be taken.
Does the app take a % of trades? Do the sellers pay a subscription?
I think the key is making it easy and attractive for sellers to accept this as payment.
Will the sellers need a bitpay account? Do they expect to get paid into their bank or Bitcoin address? 
I like the idea of letting anyone set up as a seller, then host their content at the cost of taking a cent (or %) for every trade. By going this route however, payment processing needs to be thought about, how do you take a cut without making your own payment processor.
Edit: Guess I missed the payment screens, I was thinking bitcoin only.

I feel like I almost understand stealth addresses, do they work like this?
I want to send .1 to a stealth address, ultimately I calculate a Bitcoin address that I know the recipient can generate the private key to and send the .1 btc there.
At the same time, I publish (add a fake input that's actually a message?) the clues needed for the recipient to figure out the transcation is for them, and how to generate the private key.
The recipient picks up on these clues in the blockchain, generates the private key/address and the transaction is complete.
So in this blockchain.info link, the coins went to [13cbkpKW2DdhEUmeGC2h9HyxbBdtc7Wcth]( from which any outsider can't figure out what stealth address it went to.
Is this correct?

Maybe try coding cookies into your curl requests, I can't remember if this solved it or not but I ran into this problem on another exchange some months back.
Try adding something like (php):
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, "/tmp/cookie-" . session_id());
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, "/tmp/cookie-" . session_id());
To be honest, I don't know the difference between cookiefile and cookiejar, or if it even helps, think I found it on some stackoverflow answer.
Edit: CookieJar is where curl stores cookies from the server, and CookieFile is the file curl sends to the server, so setting them both as one file makes sense.

Yeah that could work, but it's not really dependent upon Bitcoin, it would just be another method of topping up your account and you still couldn't really pay by bitcoin at the machine if that was the solution.
And I don't imagine people thinking ahead too much when it comes to purchasing at vending machines, it's more of an impulse/convenience purchase.

This is very cool, if I ever see one, I'm going to use it.

Fair enough, I wasn't aware of such a solution I figured if you weren't using something like bitpay you'd have to run your own bitcoin daemon. Makes sense though.
You could keep a database of all steam keys and their hashes on your own PC or separate storage, then when one is redeemed on your site hash it and delete the key.

Being able to "donate" to a server/user is something I thought of a while ago but I focused on other things, definitely a cool idea.

What you just said is the same as:

Just register and launch a server for free, it's real simple and takes like 5 minutes for it to set up .
If there's demand for more locations in US I can work on that.
Edit: If you really would prefer not to register let me know I'll set one up.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:16:22
You're right a permanent server would cost a lot, something I worked on previously but disabled was what I called a weekly schedule which would solve this problem. 
I disabled it to reduce the scope of the site so I had less to work on and the interface was a little complex. What it did was let you define a weekly schedule of hours you want a server for, so you could have one every night for 6 hours, reducing the uptime by 75%, this is something I can work on in the future and re enable when I'm happy with the interface and how it performs.
Ah the minecraft options are something I just realised might look confusing, see you rent a server, as described in the [pricing page]( and can then launch any game configuration on it, if you were to set the ram to higher than what your server has it just uses all the available ram.
As for site speed, I forgot to enable the cloudflare CDN which might help.
Thanks for the feedback, much appreciated.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:52:56
Hey, What sort of configurations?
I'm working on opening up the options a logged-in user would see when configuring a game.
You're right there's not much to see before registering.
Edit: If you go to "Game Choices" and click configure you'll see the simple configuration interface, there's also an advanced interface you can use when logged in that will give you more advanced access to configuration like raw editing of text files and launch arguments.

@_date: 2013-11-19 18:48:59
Thanks for putting the time into this response, most helpful.
Firstly, I'm much better at back end "getting the job done" work, web design and UI design are something I struggle with so any input there is greatly appreciated.
Getting a server without registering is something I thought about, but might take me some time to implement as the way I've coded everything requires an account in my database.
I can see how the "Refund" button is confusing, it's there if someone wanted to cancel their request before it's launched or to shorten the time their server is up for. I'll move it to the "advanced" tab for now.
My business model is like this, upon getting a server request I then send that request off to EC2, they charge me less than what I charge users. I'm trying to build something that will make a profit on any sale. For example if someone pays me $10, I'll only give them about $7 of server time, in return for the markup they get to cut out all the complicated steps of setting up a linux server.
The costs for running it all are quite low, I have two instances for my website, its like £10 a month. In theory, any other services I need from EC2 will already be paid for through the site. I haven't even considered hiring staff yet.
Although I offer Minecraft servers, I haven't put effort into offering mods and extras for that game, I feel as though right now I can't compete with other providers who have the mods all sorted out.
Thanks again for this it's a **lot** to get through, I'll edit and add anything more I can think of.

@_date: 2013-11-27 13:58:01
This is quite cool, just tried it out here's what I think.
Why not use bitpay? Their IPN will ping back to your website as soon as the coins are sent. I'm thinking it might be because of their withdrawal limits, not sure about dollars but you can only withdraw £500 minimum which I guess means you can't stock up so fast. It would be good to look into though. I also think it might be more secure than accepting payment before any confirmations. You probably don't want your wallet on your webserver.
Asking for my email address again confused me, and I got like 5 emails because I kept entering the same email address. Getting the email was helpful though as it means I know I didn't mistype my address.
Make the bitcoin address and payment amount clearer and easier to select, it's very tricky to copy and paste the address as it is a hyperlink.
The entire process took 7 minutes according to my email, including the time it took me to use my bitcoin client.
I put the key in "activate a game" because I didn't know where else to go and the $10 converted into £6.20.
I'll probably use this again, good job!

*More importantly* my client doesn't work in mBTC, so why needlessly complicate the process for the sake of those who want to make their payments "look nicer".
I guarantee if you switch to mBTC now, people will send 10x too much or 10x too little.
You may as well say pay me in unicorns, I'll still have to google it and convert to BTC.

Interesting, I could well open up in US West, I'll start doing it and see how I progress, I expanded to Australia in like a day.

Thanks for checking out the website and giving honest feedback, I'll try to suck less in the future.

This is some effort you're making, thanks.


I'll get working on this and see what I can come up with. Your solution sounds good, it isn't what I immediately thought of.
Another thing to consider when coming up with the average usage per user is the costs of network usage can be quite a lot, each game is different but for example a full "No More Room In Hell" server can use up 1GB per hour which is passed on to the user. I have a spreadsheet describing a lot of the things you mentioned, it looks much better when people use the more expensive options.


The competitive scene, gaming communities having a "night". There's also co-op games like Killing Floor where it might be easier to host one than find an appropriate empty one for a group of friends.


Something I described in another comment was weekly schedules where a user can configure a server to be up for say 75% of the month at times when they are likely to play, this is as close to a full-time server offering that I'm going to get. I've already done most of the code I just wasn't happy with the interface.
To be honest, I just want to spend my time doing something I enjoy, even if this all falls apart and fails I won't regret it as I've learnt so much about web development and system administration, and in my opinion far more than what any school can teach me. My target, is enough custom to break even and be able to say "I created this". As for my financial situation, I've got enough in Bitcoin to do me for a few months, after that I'll have to get a job, I'd just rather create something on my own than get a job.
Your response makes me want to bury my head but I'll keep on working and see what the future holds.
