As I am writing this, BTC just broke 13k on Gdax. Lightning will be one of the most monumental if not THE most important upgrade to BTC aside from the Genesis block we have yet to see. It could very well catapult BTC in 2018 to mainstream usage at an exponential rate of adoption thanks to it's easy of use and social media making it go "viral". I have never been so excited about a new technology as I am right now about the Cryptocurrency space. Go BTC.

Bcash attack. Look at Bcash pump on CMC and look at all the fud spreading in the sub right now.

Honestly, Coinbase, or any exchange for that matter is best if you plan to buy a few hundred bucks at the bare minimum. If not, and you just want $20 or $40 bucks worth, just walk to your nearest Bitcoin ATM, put the cash in the machine and just send it to your wallet. Done. No ID, no registering at a site, you got your coins.

Nicehash was just hacked today for 60 million in BTC. The value of BTC will attract some of the best hackers on earth, you best believe you better never leave any BTC in any exchange from now on. Download a bitcoin wallet for your phone and transfer it there, even better get a hardware wallet.

I like your card idea but this one is only human-proof, it's not destruction proof. You could accidentally lose a few cards from the deck or they could be burned in a fire. You need to find a way to personally encrypt the words into something easy for you to decrypt, AND turn that into something physically durable. That's why I like the idea of a 100-200 word paragraph carved into a metal sheet.

Whales have always done this in markets that are still small enough for them to manipulate. With BTC, time is running out because as the marketcap increases, their ability to pump and dump decreases. Also take into account most of people's BTC is stored away in cold storage for the long term, not in some exchange waiting to be panic sold.

What is the TLDR on this? Are they approving or disapproving of crypto? Reads to me they are putting it on positive light and if futures are a success it could pave the way for ETF approval. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:04:55
Anyone got some chips for this dip?

Please check the FAQ on the side panel of this sub, it has everything in there you will want to know.

In January, Coinbase will release all the Bcash coins to people that owned BTC during the fork. There's a bit of a civil war between BTC and Bcash, so they coordinate FUD on reddit, push their agenda that Bcash can scale and BTC can't. So when January comes they hope all those people will not sell their Bcash for BTC. Truth is Bcash also does not solve the scale issue, bigger blocks are a tiny bandaid. Lightning network is around the corner and Bcash is panicking.

This is not even the real dip yet, I'm still waiting! My body is ready
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:34:27
It's not instant, you have to wait. But eventually you will see the transaction on the ledger and then wait some more to get the first confirmation.

ELI5: It's a "pretend" buying and selling bitcoin exchange. There is no actual bitcoin involved, only the value of it in USD. You purchase a "bet" today that 1 BTC will be 15k in June 1st. Come June 1st, 1 BTC is actually worth 16.5K, so you just made $1500 bucks and the guy that sold you that bet just lost $1500. 
I use the word "bet" because nobody has a fucking clue what BTC price will be in the future.

Around here they are called shitcoins for a reason.

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:25:53
Best way to do it IMO is average buys on the way down. Once coast seems to be clear tomorrow after Futures are live, then average on the way up.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:01:46
Not so sure about that with all the positive media attention this weekend. Slight dip come Monday and then rally after that.

This letter idea is genius, thank you. Just make sure to inscribe the letter into a stainless steel sheet.

Yes default fee is rather high at this point in time for BTC until segwit adoption grows and lightning network is deployed next year. But best thing to do is use a good wallet that lets you pick your own fee. Faster = more expensive, cheaper = slower. I recommend Samurai wallet on android or GreenAddress wallet for iOS.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:07:06
Thanks. Seems like we still have ways to go.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:44:57
It is being pumped HARD right now before the first Futures opens on the 10th. Looks like they are going for a short like many have been saying.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:58:27
Google authenticator stores the codes on the device only. If you lose it, the codes are lost. You will need to contact Binance support and provide them with identity information and they will be able to get you back into your account. I recommend using Authy app. It works with google authenticator codes but it allows you to backup the codes and also add additonal devices (Like an ipad or PC) to authenticate. Just make sure after you add devices, you disable the multi-device feature in settings.

This is actually good for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:44
LMAO look at coincap right now everyone is selling their shitcoins to buy the BTC dip
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:47:03
You can safely buy a Ledger Nano S from a third party, get the cheaper one you find. If you notice, the box no longer comes with an authenticity seal anymore. This is because a Nano S is hardware verified the second you connect it to a computer and open the Ledger App. If it is not genuine, the app will say so. A little google search on this will go into more detail.

Well, think about this. If people hodl, how could it get to 1 cent? It would only get to that price if everyone sold, which is not what hodlers do. The hodler mentality is to hodl until you reach your personal "moon". So if everyone keeps hodling towards a goal, then the only other way is up. This is why many people believe in the philosophy that BTC will either fail (Go to 0) or succeed, but it cannot be in-between.
So if it was going to fail, then it would've failed already by now in catastrophic scenarios like Mt Gox, Silk Road, China ban, hard forks, etc.
We are seeing the growth of BTC because FUD is decreasing. The hodl mantra is not only a sound investing strategy, but it also encourages trust in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:56:05


It became a meme for a reason though. Buy and hodl is a strategy that has proven itself for the last 9 years without fail.

Guess what people will be saying in November 30th, 2018?
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:37:40
BTC has been gaining traction and recognition after every major landmark price we hit. We just hit 10K just days ago, and we have CME Futures, Chicago Exchange Futures, Record number of signups at Coinbase (that it rektd their servers), Big Bang Theory episode (mainstream media) and now it is actually being used as a currency for one of the "Big Four" accounting firms! 5th largest private company in the US. And BTC isn't even in it's final currency form yet.
Wait until LN, atomic swaps starts becoming a reality next year. 2018 is gonna be HUGE for BTC.

Um, you can bypass cryptographic attestation? Please do show me.
That was just an old guide that showed you how to open up the Ledger to check for any changes to the PCB. They removed it because it's obsolete now with cryptographic attestation. You don't need to do anything anymore. Just connect the Ledger, open the app, and it will verify the device. 
I know we all want to triple check all these devices that will hold BTC, but Ledger states their device is tamper-proof and this statement comes included in the box even. When and if cryptographic attestation is ever broken, trust me they will be the first to let you know.

Yes coinbase &gt; gdax &gt; hardware wallet is the way to go. No transaction fees at all.
Hardware wallet and phone wallet are two totally separate and different wallets. They cannot link. You want to keep most of your funds in the hardware wallet and from time to time send some spending money over to the phone wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:27
Relax relax boys... this is the dip many have been waiting for expect for a rise to 12K after this mellows out.
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:37:09
Coinbase account is required. GDAX is just the exchange version of Coinbase. In GDAX you can buy/sell without fees if you use limit orders. But it takes 4 days to deposit funds into GDAX unless you do a wire. In Coinbase you pay fees every time but they do instant purchase (it locks your buy price while you wait on bank transfer).
Best hardware wallets are Trezor or Ledger Nano S.
