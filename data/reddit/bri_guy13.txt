I do agree with ya on the 5% transfer fee though, I didn’t know that was a fee until after I deposited lmao. Idk I’d still recommend it I’m enjoying using it so far. I’m just glad we can atleast winthdraw into canadian. I hear coinbase allows you to deposit but not withdraw if you’re canadian

Hmm I’m not too sure Ive traded bitcoin to other coins and vice versa and gotten what I was quoted at so I’d imagine it’s what you withdraw Into your account after you convert your currency to CAD

Hold. Always hold.

Yeah that is kinda vague, well I guess the only thing I can offer ya is that yes there’s a 5% fee when you fund your account, and then if you buy and hold, you’ll pay that 30 dollar fee you said earlier when you withdraw. Ultimately it’s your choice obviously but as I said I’ve heard good things from friends so I started using it and I can back them up and say it’s a good exchange

Coinsquare. I know many people who use it and I myself just started using it. Verification takes a few days and then if you don’t have Interac online to do it instantly, the e transfer from your bank to the app can take a couple days as well. But everything works exactly as you would want it to
