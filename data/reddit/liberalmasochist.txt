Can’t believe I have to spell out to people the joke was I was only making an issue about the film part of his statement. Are you American or German by any chance?

Stop spouting nonsense, Samuel L Jackson wasn’t in Terminator 2.

Or maybe he just lost his private keys somehow and is too embarrassed to admit it.

I really hope that this person is actually from bitfinex and decided 'Butthole_Gangbang' would be an excellent PR friendly name

So people can run pirated apps... literally no other valid reason.
@_date: 2019-01-02 13:46:34
Err, no it doesn't get the job done unless you have personally audited all of the javascript libraries you have used. Could be a bitcoin stealer in any of them...
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:20:19
There is no guarantee they won't increase the supply one day though through a fork
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:40:24
Oh ok, a fair point I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:13:09
And both could be worth zero in a few years time!!
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:23:06
What are you talking about? Excessive heat damages electronic components, and running a miner for 36h will cause heat outside the expected parameters on a MacBook. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:06:02
The marijuana of crypto!
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:45:01
You probably just shortened the life on your MacBook by several months as well lol
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:25:22
Nice trade, you seemed to get that one right! I'm hoping for a sub $1000 crash, going to be interesting to see where it ends up.
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:46:20
Or maybe he was so over confident of his abilities he just got lazy?
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:56:55
What's so hard about 2/4 and .1/.2 games now?
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:12:51
You can snort coke with dollar bills, and make jewellery with gold... can't hoover up a line with my bitcoin or turn it into a gangster tooth filling
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:03:41
Unfortunately you bought at the top of the bubble which now appears to be bursting, hope you didn't need that money any time soon but don't worry it will most likely be worth at least 5k a coin in a few years.

Software developer? You’ve cobbled together hundreds of badly written JavaScript libraries to do a simple loop that could be achieved in about 20 lines of code...
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:13:21
I just wish they took debit cards from Europe.
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:37:11
Bitstamp instantly reject every card I try with them despite being verified. Works fine with coinbase, which I thought was strange as I heard a lot of bad things about coinbase.

I love the spikes and crashes mainly because we get to see so many gifs of rollercoaster bitcoin guy. The pictures calming but exciting in an eerie way.
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:23:42
Copay seems to be pretty good
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:36:18
Why on earth would they ever do that 
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:04:33
I mine ETH and trade it for BTC, it's nice to gain bitcoin from all my old mining rigs I couldn't be bothered to sell after it became pointless to mine BTC using GPU.
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:23:37
Glad it worked out for you man, that Mt. Gox loss would of made me furious 
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:50:22
So he basically kept his coins on an exchange account, and couldn't be bothered to protect either his email account or exchange account with free and extremely easy to use Google authenticator or similar... sorry but no sympathy this is like someone leaving a bag of cash in a parked car in a dangerous area and then complaining when it gets stolen.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:30:15
Trezor and Ledger seem to be the most popular.
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:08:44
The professionals I have used before tend to charge per gigabyte recovered, this would be a rare case that would be a big loss for them I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:54:05
I like coinigy but it's not free
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:46:49
Yes but the guy had his email account hacked as well as he didn't enable 2FA on that. Of course it is everyone's fault apart from his according to him.
