Looks like I stand corrected, you learn something new every day.  There's an example of an unjust law if there ever was one.

Eh? The coins were made of actual gold or silver.  Not entirely, because they mixed them with copper to make them more durable, this is common for coins compared to bullion.  Also old copper coins used to be pure copper.  Today's 'copper' coins are just copper-plated nickel because it's cheaper.

I don't see why coins pre-1969 can't be melted down, they are pre-decimalisation (though I think they can be exchanged at the Bank of England, but only for equivalent face value which will be very low compared to the scrap value of the metal).  That money is already out of circulation.  If it was all melted down tomorrow it wouldn't cause any deflation.  
Even modern coins are only a small fraction of the total money in circulation, most of which is electronic, in bank accounts etc., not physical.  But nobody is going to melt down modern coins, it would cost more in energy than their scrap value. 
Judging by the sale of scrap silver coins on ebay, they certainly do get melted down regularly.  Nobody is buying those coins to collect them, many of them are worn almost smooth now.  Maybe getting the Bank of England's permission to melt them down, as a metals dealer or jeweller or whatever, isn't that difficult.

You fixed one out of three... but if you've learned the difference between its and it's then my work here is done.

Until relatively recently (1960s) coins were made of gold or silver (or copper for the pennies) at least in the US/UK.  Also in the US, until the gold standard ended, paper money was exchangeable for bullion.  Gold and silver have been used as money for thousands of years.  If you dig up ancient coins, they're still valuable now.  Today's fiat coins made of base metals will be worthless in future, just as bitcoin is worthless if the power goes out or it's ever declared illegal.

It's not illegal to destroy currency in the UK, gold and silver coins with the Queen's head on them which are still legal tender are melted down every day legally here.

I did a bit more reading on it.  It is legal to melt them down if they were issued prior to May 1969.  Yes it has to be done by someone with a licence issued by the government, but enough private dealers have these to mean scrap silver (old UK coins) sells for close to spot price and can be readily traded for cash at various places legally.  Anyway what was this thread about again? lol... gone off on a bit of a tangent here I guess.

Also because you want to live in it now.  For the same reason why high deflation in consumer electronics never prevented people buying the latest tech over the last several decades.  Unless you really don't want or need it now, you'll buy regardless that you know the price will be lower later.
Other than that, you are right about bitcoin's non-viability as a currency.  It makes no sense to spend it when you can use regular currency instead.

Other way round.  Like how Zimbabwe's stock market was the best performing in the world during the hyperinflation period.
tl;dr - if the USD collapsed it would be better to be holding stocks than cash.

Don't those two go hand in hand?  I mean at the moment there must be a lot of fear that BTC could collapse, but there's simultaneously a lot of greed.  So what do you do.  Some are fearful, others are greedy.  I think your quote's first line makes more sense.  Or to put it another way, greed is good, but not too much greed.
