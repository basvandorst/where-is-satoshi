I've been frustrated with new reddit and their mobile app that expands all content by default.  It's become a bloated, slow feed that's been looking more like facebook everyday (and I absolutely hate facebook).  It made me yearn for the 2010 days when I could see 20+ links at once and I could pick what to look at.
My dream scenario was:
1. Website that instantly loads.  Scan for interesting headlines amongst a few dozen.
2. Ctrl+click to open up 10 new tabs that caught my interest.
3. Be done with my daily crypto news update.
This actually isn't a new project.  The site's been around for a year or so, mostly for personal use that I've slowly improved as the weeks went by.  After showing it to a few personal friends, they've insisted I post it to reddit.  I'd been procrastinating / being a coward sharing it publicly until today.  I've never been good about actually launching side projects, preferring to improve it endlessly and until it rotted away in obscurity.
If you want to give it a [try]( and give feedback, I'd be grateful.   Screenshot: [
* Links on a page.  That's it.  HTML is very dinosaur using the latest technology like `&lt;a&gt;`
* 57kb on your first load, then 3.1kb for any loads after that.  I've found it particularly helpful for fast loads on mobile.
* Brings together mainstream sources that I wouldn't normally see aside from the random occasional article posted on * Very lightweight price monitor that updates the tab title.  It helps me keep an eye on price having a tab open at work without having to open an exchange page that sucks away my CPU.
* Wizard logo paying tribute to our favorite magic internet money advocate.
* No fancy javascript bullshit.  There's plenty of apps / other aggregator sites out there that do special stuff with comments / inline previews, etc.  This does none of that.
* No ads / cookies / facebook connect / registration / logins.
* No images / videos / audio—anything that isn't links on a page.
It'd mean a lot if you could let me know what you think.  Hopefully it's somewhat useful.

There has *never* been a time in Bitcoin history where it has spiked 25% in one day and not have some secondary bullish pump.  A definite higher low on the weekly is as sure of a signal you'll get that this is the time to at least *start* building a spot long position.
Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if all this time is to build up critical mass pressure + margin positions until absolutely exploding up to 6.5k in a few minutes.  Zero chance any longs waiting on the sidelines to buy in, complete obliteration of any margin shorts that thought 6k would be rejected at first.  How many shorts do you think placed their stop right above 6k?  It's too delicious a target *not* to hit that stop run.
If I were a whale looking to get the bull run started (as it seems like the one that bought April 1st wants to do), this seems like the optimal strategy.

If you're moving $10M I doubt a transaction fee of $1 vs $10 (or even $100!) will affect your decision. We're still so very early in the Bitcoin lifecycle. Transaction fees *will* be much higher and the market will naturally price out useless spammy TX.  That's ok as it means people are finding that much value from the Bitcoin network to pay those costs.  That means for everyone who hold Bitcoin will be much *much* more valuable.  Most day-to-day transactions will be made through lightning / other layer 2 technologies.
Personally, I'm very happy when transaction fees rise through the roof because that is the definite sign that whales are at play and are willing to put up with insanely high prices *because* Bitcoin is worth 10,000x more.

The fact that nearly everyone thinks they'll have a breather after rejecting 6k is the reason blowing past it will yield max profit for the whales. When *everyone* expects 6k to be granite resistance, guess how many people will have their sell orders there and will feel the fomo when it shoots past?
It's just a lesson for me but I've learned to be very reluctant to believe things that are obvious. The obvious narrative seems to be: if it goes down, 5k support, if it goes up, 6k resistance. If it goes to 6k, I'll have a chance to buy in at 5.5k once it rejects.
When everyone thinks that way, figure out what that next level strategy will be.  Going with the herd has proven to be a very unprofitable strategy.
