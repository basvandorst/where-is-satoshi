I’m more interested as to how you got into university at what i assume is around 12 years old based off your description.

The entire transaction history of Bitcoin is visible by just downloading the client and downloading the blockchain. There are some websites like blockchain.info that have some nicely presented pages of to and from addresses to help you analyse the flow of the coins. Realistically though, a few transactions and you can't tell where the btc are any more...

Unless you’re young then the industry rips you off. Source: am young engineer. Faster, know as-much and solve problems for others yet I earn 30-50% less.

Or an equivalent key for that message of which there could be many or none. The mathematics suggest the likelihood of that occurring would take all computation in the network many ages of the universe dedicated to generating messages to even have a small chance of achieving that. Though it is still worth noting.
Just to demonstrate,
Private key is 256 bits long, that is 1.15e77 possible keys.
To break that with every hash on the network dedicated to trying where one attempt was equivalent to a hash at the current rate of 15e9 TH/s would take 1.9*10\^48 times the age of the universe, to guarantee a solution.
In a universe where 13.6 billion years of computation could be done once a second and that had been computing since the start of time and that was itself 13.6 billion years old; that contained a nested universe where again as many hashes had been performed since its beginning of time but with respect to the super universe performing a standard universe of calculating per second for 13.6 billion years but here, was doing the sum total itself, once per second: it would take still 1.2 days to compute.
