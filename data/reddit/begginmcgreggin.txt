There’s a whole list of use cases and value factors you could point to. The spéculative aspect is that no one knows the future for sure the exact demand will be (and thus the future value and price) but people are willing to bet on it.

ITT and any other thread where OP mentions leverage: people not understanding leverage.
Sorry for your loss OP. How much were you leveraged? And at what price point?

There is no pool. The buyers give fiat (or an alt) to the sellers of bitcoin. Think about it the same way as buying gold. If there are only 10 gold bars on the market and they are each bought for $1000 it's not like $10,000 goes into some pool which determines the market cap. 10k is simply what was transacted. If the next day buyers are willing to pay $1500 per bar then the total worth of the bars in the market is $15k.

I’m personally slightly leveraged and I have had to fight myself multiple times not to add more. It’s always tempting to magnify those gains but you have more to lose if the price moves against you since you can’t just hold out for longer term price trends.
You were playing with fire and now you know what could happen and the feelings associated.
You’ll find other opportunities in the future. Just make sure you don’t let your emotions handle the decisions. Invest because of what you know and not what you hope for.
Good luck in the future OP. Let your biggest losses be your biggest gains.
