the reason for protesting are because some HK people dont want to be included in crimal extradition. hong kong dont have extradtion agreement with many country, so when you commit crime in other country, once you flet to hong kong, you cant be extradited back your country of crime origin. and some people dont want to change that. is nothing to do with the government, it is more like a million criminals dont want to be sent back.

Bakkt turns out to be paper backed scam just like CME. And of course designed to supress btc price

you are more like spineless Weasels, have no idea of nothing. look up what event caused the extradition law to be changed, before you speak out your brained dead opinions.

If they want they really can destory the price of the bitcoin with nap of the fingers through naked shorting.
@_date: 2019-04-18 18:06:35
still more likely than CW
@_date: 2019-09-23 01:51:39
seems like the first thing they tried is to see if shorting works. old classic wall street.
