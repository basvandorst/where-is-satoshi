I honestly don't mind, when in doubt I'll choose the option that results in less taxes. As long as it's defensible I think they'll have a hard time doing anything except maybe making you pay it later. Doubt they'd nail you with a fee for something like this.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:31:45
Yeah, that's not great either but I understand why the core client isn't top priority given that the vast majority of transactions don't originate from it. Doesn't excuse it though, I have no trouble saying that core has been surprisingly slow in implementing it.

$5-20 is high, but nowhere near unusable.
I'm talking about hundreds per tx if adoption keeps increasing without more throughput.

I'm following the thread just fine, you implied that this has been in the works for a long time, while the truth is we have no evidence that development wasn't started very recently.
The point I was making is that they definitely weren't working on it for nearly that long, because he *recently* said that they were *looking at adding it* which implies that they have not begun the technical work.

Nice comparison, except PoS exists. You made a specific criticism of it.

Looking at adding it means not even working on it..if you are working on it that's way past "looking at adding it."

If you are only sending they actually cant screw you over. If you have received, they can broadcast an old balance (before you received money) and in that case you or someone else has to broadcast proof that they cheated.

Fees gotta go down eventually, or at least somewhat keep up with adoption, otherwise they will get rediculous. Luckily there's a lot of work going into making that happen.

Not something I can summarize in a comment, if you can't listen don't worry, it isn't some groundbreaking insight about bitcoin.
I found it interesting because it's coming from a traditional and academic economic perspective without being some biased garbage from Goldman Sachs. To be fair I was a fan of the podcast before crypto got so huge it became a recurring topic.

That's an insane amount of time for a company like coinbase to take implementing something like this..try 1-2 months, maybe 4 on the highest end.


*Project* schedules? You are seriously overestimating how big of a deal implementing SegWit is (especially for some of the most experienced blockchain devs in the country). We aren't reinventing the wheel here, reference implementations for batching and SegWit already exist. For batching they've existed for years.
Consider how fast companies like Ledger, Trezor, and some exchanges were able to implement segwit. Coinbase might have higher standards and more performance concerns, but that doesn't warrant 6x the development time.


What have I said that makes you think I'm outraged? You were implying that development has been underway for some time when all evidence says otherwise.

I don't know much about PoS past the general concept and never claimed to.
You claim to have knowledge, but refuse to share it because "it doesn't take much intelligence to figure it out." 
Done with this comment thread, would like to know more about the disadvantages of PoS, but doesn't seem like I'll be getting that out of you since you're either unwilling or unable to make a coherent point about it (yet strangely willing to argue back and forth over whether you have the responsibility to back up anything you say).

Except in practice it will be less than that. The true multiple will be 10 only if there is zero leakage, in practice it will be much less. People who take loans tend to not put that money directly back into a bank account because it makes zero fucking sense to do so.
Leakage is going to be way, way higher than zero. If you don't know what leakage is then maybe read a book instead of shitposting.

I've really enjoyed this podcast because the outside perspective really cuts out all the FUD in either direction. You won't hear these guys saying bitcoin is going to $50k or $1k (usually they won't be talking about crypto at all), but when they do talk about Bitcoin you'll get some of the most levelheaded and informed opinions coming from the general econ / investment community that I've heard.

It trades based on the price of Bitcoin. Futures aren't a new invention, there are futures for everything from stocks to oil to gold to apples. 
And what a lot of people miss is that this futures market *will* effect the price. If the future price gets too untethered from actual Bitcoin price, it creates an arbitrage opportunity that someone will take advantage of.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:09:33
Which don't exist yet. Options would be ideal because they have limited downside, unlike futures where you can get margin called.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:06:16
I don't think so. Exchanges like coinbase would be part of the lightning network. As long as the employer had a connection with an exchange like coinbase (which is likely, given that it can be across multiple hops) you wouldn't have to close out the channel to cash into USD.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:02:28
Nah but it works with Mycelium. Never tried it myself though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:29
Sorry, how were you proved correct? Because they listed BCH? I never made the claim that they wouldn't, although I will admit I'm surprised! Especially by the timing.
Anyway, none of you're three possibilities will have been proven correct unless it's confirmed that the reason behind the listing is that they have a fractional reserve. Wait till then to dig up an old comment thread.
Whether or not they have fractional reserve, they *do* make money by driving trade and speculation, fractional reserve isn't the best explanation of their actions imo.

*My* core developer? Wow, didn't realize I had my own, wish he was one I agreed with /s.
BTC developers aren't a monolith. One guy can be wrong without reflecting badly on the rest of the devs, or nullifying his contributions (despite his shit opinion).
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:24:52
Yes, but the chances of that happening are so small that we can safely assume it will never happen.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:48:32
Your point 2 is nonsense. If the futures price moves significantly in either direction against the actual BTC price it creates an arbitrage opportunity. The price of the futures will *absolutely* effect the BTC price, it's super ignorant to pretend it won't. The direction is up in the air.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:34:38
Agreed, obviously that is insane. And yes, a lot of people on this sub fall into that category.
That doesn't mean every person putting significant money into BTC is insane. People were saying that when it was at $100
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:05:20
Were you transferring large amounts in Bittrex? I had to give them my info for basically the same reason. Hoping they don't bother selling my info because it was only a few hundred $ worth. Fuck that shit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:10:08
They aren't making money off of Bitcoin network transaction fees, they are making money off of *Coinbase* buying and selling fees, and GDAX market order fees..
I'm not saying they shouldn't use segwit, they should and I agree they'd save money. But it's pretty childish to assume that the people at Coinbase don't care about Bitcoin or crypto in general.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:22:26
No it won't hang if you use a high transaction fee (like $10 is more than enough right now) which won't be a problem for people with a big BTC investment. 
I've been making deposits into coinbase a couple times a week for the last few months, hasn't been too bad.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:51:23
Get used to it, people on this sub love to take some wierd moral high ground on bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-15 19:17:14
They said they will let users withdraw it only, which means they'll have to figure out a way to sell it or hold themselves. Not sure if coinbase will implement a time limit for how long they will hold for you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:32:46
The code speaks for itself. I'm glad they aren't announcing dates then having to push them back. It's done when it's done, until then you can play with it on test net.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:05:51
Yeah, they still have a chart posted somewhere saying it will be withdraw only. It's true, though, it could definitely be one of the currencies they decide to add. I hope not.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:39:21
there is an option for stop limit actually. click "advanced" when placing a stop order.
I recommend not even bothering though. It's more likely to screw you over in a temporary dip than to actually save you money. If you want to sell, sell now with a high price, don't sell once it goes down.

You'll at least need the main ledger app to download new wallets to the device. For transactions though, there are desktop wallets that are compatible with Ledger and/or Trezor, for example electrum works with both.
For some of the altcoins you might need the chrome app though.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:16:40
Sort of, booting into an offline linux install to encrypt it real quick and print it on a trusted printer is fairly safe. You only have to do this once, as opposed to paper wallets where you'd need to do it every time you send a tx.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:12:32
You can encrypt your seed if you want, or keep it in a physically secure location like a safe deposit box. Managing your keys/seed is a necessity for *any* wallet. Trusting a single piece of hardware is irresponsible. In fact, having copies of your keys in only one place is pretty bad in general, regardless of what the medium is.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:58:39
That's such BS, do you have any idea how much money Coinbase is making right now off of fees?

Why do they have to close the channel to pay the employees? Couldn't individual employees close their channels with McDonalds individually? And chances are most of them wouldn't need to since McDonalds would have channels open with other major players.
It will definitely need to be closed periodically, so that a mega-transaction (between two high volume networks) will actually fit in a block, but I think a week is an underestimate. If it's an employee getting paid, the channel could probably stay open indefinitely assuming the employee is able to spend normally through the channel.

Bitcoin and Litecoin will probably get it first. It's open source though, nothing is stopping other coins from implementing it unless there's some technical incompatibility.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:13:31
Eh. It's fine, but their fees for some smaller coins/tokens are complete garbage. I just paid 30 REQ for a withdrawal ($7.50).
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:43:18
But why? It only makes sense if you have a loss, and want to offset some other gains for 2017 taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:46:11
yup! If you don't need support for as many altcoins though I'd get the trezor instead. I have both, and the trezor has a much better interface and it's easier to switch between wallets. On the Ledger you have to install a ton of chrome apps, and cycle the apps you have on the device. Trezor supports most big coins like BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, DASH etc, but not as many as ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:54:26
Yes, the fees are completely unsustainable

@_date: 2017-12-17 07:47:49
Huh? The $10 (at most) it costs to send BTC to an exchange is going to be a hell of a lot less than any PayPal fees, not to mention a lot less work and postage.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:41:50
Huh? That's not what I'm saying at all, please re read my posts. I think LN is extremely important for Bitcoin, I just don't think you know what you're talking about when you say they aren't releasing it quickly enough.

yes it supportes litecoin and a ton of others. once you set up your ledger it will spit out receive addresses for you (through your computer) like any wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:11:48
There's literally no point in doing that instead of just writing down all 24 words. A computer could run through all possibilities for that last word in a few seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:12:05
Shorting the futures isn't much different. The point this guy is making is that shorting is a *bad* way to bet against something like Bitcoin. Shorting, whether it's futures or shares, has unlimited downside potential. 
If BTC explodes to 100k then goes to zero two weeks later, everyone who shorted before it exploded gets *fucked* because they got margin called during the run up. 
On the other hand, if those same people held bearish options, they'd end up winning.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:51:15
That's how many you can have installed onto the ledger at once. If you deposit coins, then uninstall the app, then reinstall it later, your coins will still be safe. Even though the app was gone, your keys will still be generated off of the same seed.
Totally agreed this is annoying, and not something that happens on a trezor (trezor has less coins though). You can use your ledger to store every alt coin it supports at once though, just gotta shuffle apps.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:48:24
It's hard to say whether now is a good time, seeing as how bad segwit adoption is. At these TX prices we might not have a choice but to increase it though.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:32:57
Not sure what you mean, right now a transaction is $2-5, which will hopefully go down significantly as many transactions are brought off-chain. 
Yes, if you run out of funds I believe you need to do an on-chain tx to add funds. But how often is the McDonalds payroll going to run out of funds? Not every week I bet..especially if they are receiving funds through purchases on the lightning network. The employees don't have to worry, because their LN "wallet" is getting replenished every 2 weeks with their paycheck, no reason to close and open channels. Theoretically, they can keep their connection to the McDonalds network open indefinitely, and make all of their purchases through there assuming McDonalds is well connected to the rest of the network (doesn't have to be direct, could take multiple hops).
LN is useful if many transactions happen off chain, and when they are finally put on chain, in one giant transaction, they can do so more efficiently than a bunch of individual transactions.
Do I think it's a final solution to scaling? Hell no. But I *do* think it has the potential to dramatically increase the number of transactions happening without even increasing blocksize (thereby dramatically decreasing tx cost), which is pretty amazing, especially without a hard fork.

There are 2^96 possible private keys, which is 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976. That's orders of magnitude higher than the number of grains of sand, so imagine looking for a specific grain of sand (or even one of billions) if I didn't even tell you which continent to look on.
Divide that number by a good guess for the number of computers in the world times the number of addresses those could compute in a second.
Now, that gives you the amount of time to generate *all* addresses, not to get a single collision..my statistics is a bit rusty, but this should give you an idea of how large the space is.

Nah, the price is only directly effected by exchanges (trading Bitcoin for other currency like USD). This is just people withdrawing money from an exchange. An exchange, like Gdax or whatever, will wait till they have a ton of withdrawals stacked up, and fulfill all of them in one single transaction. This saves them a lot on transaction fees.

Don't regret it, you took profits. I had ~10 BTC at the beginning of this run and I've sold down to ~8. Woulda been cool if I sold them all today instead of mixed between 8-$16k, but it was the correct decision.

Yes that sounds good. You can also do gdax instead of gemini either way works. If you don't get the trezor right away it's fine to leave BTC on the exchange temporarily, both Gemini and gdax (Coinbase) are safe enough for that.
Don't invest it all right away, dollar cost average. Things are insane right now, expect a big correction (or maybe not, who knows).

But what makes you think there isn't already a sense of urgency? Just because they aren't constantly posting stuff?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:46:38
Don't they have to eventually fall back into balance? Just don't sell during circuit breakers?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:07:17
is there any reason not to? it saves you a ton on fees.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:12:42
guess it depends when they sold it..
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:41:47
It's gone, unless Coinbase is super nice and refunds you, but realize that it would be 100% loss for them; the hacker already got the Bitcoin so it would be out of pocket.
It is absolutely worth trying, Coinbase is flush right now so it's not impossible that they would take the hit in the name of customer service, but it's unlikely, especially because of the precedent it would set.
Read the stories about the people who lost millions due to similar mistakes, and then get a hardware wallet if you decide to buy back in with a significant amount of cash.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:01:12
Don't think so, but electrum does
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:23:39
They've been around for *ever* and are a registered company in Luxembourg. They follow US banking laws to do business here.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:11:20
Idk, the log chart from $9k - $19k looks pretty bubbly, just like 2013. A correction to $10k wouldn't surprise me.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:28:38
well, currently it's pointless because BCH isn't even processing enough transactions to fill tiny BTC blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:09:24
just purchase it from them, it would be really difficult to backdoor though
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:48:17
No, it's harder to use than just electrum but much, much safer. You can also use it with electrum if you like that interface but want the security benefits.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:58
It happened I wanna say a month ago. I traded a very small amount of BCH for BTC at a rate of ONE HALF of a BTC per BCH. 
That was on Kraken. The opportunity didn't last long then bitthumb crashed and so did BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:42:04
time to sell guys 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:56:38
I don't know, are they going to ignore my physical wallet? 
Your criticism isn't even about bitcoin, but the ecosystem surrounding it. Software will eliminate most of the headache surrounding safety.

Yes, zimbabwe based online exchange. I'm sure there's localbitcoins type market too, but it would be just as high or higher.

Good one
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:17:16
If your keys aren't encrypted they only need access to the wallet data on your hard drive, no longer necessary. 
I'm guessing that's less common nowadays though.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:55:37
Might as well try and see what happens
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:43:47
Yeah, that's what I mean, without any additional hardware you'd be exposing it to the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:52:00
Ha I'm saying it's a significant investment, pay the $99 to secure it better
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:45:53
You should print out a paper wallet, it's the best security / dollar. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:02:49
That would seriously help BCH. If he wanted to tank BCH he'd sell it or make a faucet that gives out 10 BCH or something.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:15:10
If BTC price drops that much (unlikely) certain BTC proponents will continue to mine it at a loss, like slush pool. Then difficulty will adjust way downward, and hopefully things will even out.
There has always been a risk that BTC tanks and everyone just stops mining it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:17:50
The exchange will not except them because they are unredeemable. They are releasing a new client that "blacklists" the coins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:30:59
They're blacklisting the tether. Not sure what the point of this would be, why not just put nonexistent tether on bitfinex? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:21:55
Your comment made no sense dude, what do taxes have to do with monero?
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:03:31
What?? So I could avoid all tax on my BTC gains by just using it as currency? Holy crap..
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:04:17
They're letting you withdraw, not buy, sell, or deposit it afaik. Not letting customers withdraw would basically be theft at current prices.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:56:09
but still..why? you can do all those things with non-dead currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:55:59
Yes, super laggy, orders rarely go through 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:39:13
Eh. I had coins before the split, I converted 50% of BCH into BTC and other cryptos over the last week, and have been converting more slowly since. I don't want to go down to zero BCH, but I don't think it has the utility of other big cryptos (ETH, XMR, LTC etc).
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:04:22

No, you are the only one having any issues.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:53:30
What are you talking about, you pay a one-time fee (multi address transaction into a segwit address) and then ALL your future transactions are cheaper. This isn't Chase.com, if a $20 fee is a dealbreaker then you fucked up.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:57:23
FDIC would only apply to dollars. The government has no legal concept of putting BTC in a "bank"
However, this doesn't mean they weren't able to buy insurance for the Bitcoin from a 3rd party.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:15:47
Because they are probably using the password you give them to access your actual blockchain wallet on the backend. Sorry bud it looks like your BTC got stolen /:
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:55:01
The answer is definitely to trust Coinbase. A company trying to invest in Bitcoin would:
* Need to develop a system and the protocols around storing Bitcoin. If they screw up they're 100% SOL, nobody else to pin the blame on.
* Hire people who know how to do this. Right now nobody at Hedge Fund X knows anything about Bitcoin, how will they even know who to hire? It's not a very well established field.
Their choice is either to just pay the 10 mil to Coinbase, or take on all this extra overhead. If in 6 months they decide Bitcoin was a mistake, they're out all that money and have to do layoffs. Paying Coinbase the 5 mil is a lot easier to stomach.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:45:45
I would have guessed they'd be able to set their own price, obviously they'd be forced to compete heavily with on chain transactions anyway so this would surprise me.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:39:27
Right now yes, eventually maybe not
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:10:12
It's not a problem unless you think the folks behind tether are committing outright fraud. Tether is supposedly backed 1:1 by real USD, so it's no difference than people depositing USD to trade with.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:02:36
I have mine unencrypted. I figure the probability of a brain injury or death, where I'd lose the encryption key, is more likely than a deposit box getting stolen.
I guess you could always store half the key in one box, other half in the other box..might do that
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:46:00
Disagree completely, if you get malware then your BTC will probably be stolen from electrum pretty much instantly.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:40:25
if it was it's own thing it wouldn't have cloned the BTC blockchain. airdropping coins is garbage, cheap way to gain fast adoption. Look at bitcoin gold lol.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:54:15
The receiving address doesn't affect the price, only the sending address.
But yes, you can make a segwit paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:06:14
I assume you can use a hash to prove the firmware from trezor is the same as this. If you're extra paranoid you could compile it yourself and flash that.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:00:12
64MB??? It would make running full nodes extremely expensive very quickly. Also, transaction fees *need* to be somewhat significant. Eventually the block reward will hit zero. With 64MB blocks there would be NO incentive to mine blocks, so bitcoin would die.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:43:56
? why would miners need to use bcash for payment of anything? Even if BTC reaches $40 transactions there is still LTC, ETH, XMR, DASH and others that have less volatile price than BCH does, which make them better for payments.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:04:35
Yeah, the advantage is that signing transactions happens on the actual device. Even though it's plugged into your PC, your private keys are never exposed. 
With a paper wallet you'd need to expose the keys to an internet connected device to spend the coins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:15:10
Cool then I can safely ignore it
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:03:59
The market will always inflate the block size more than it should if given the option..there's not enough of a downside to making bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:02:19
bitcoin used to be worthless, so you can bet there was a ton lost back when nobody cared. this was never true for the dollar.
also keep in mind that the vast, vast majority of fiat currency is purely digital, loss of bills is nothing compared to bitcoin currency destruction.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:54:51
What's wrong with the hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:58:47
buying a put contract gives you the option to sell (bearish)
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:48:41
Of course it's a valid transaction. In this case spam = intentionally clogging the network (sending $0.10 with a $8.00 fee or something). 
But there's obviously no way to sort these, they need to be processed. I agree with that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:45:46
Obviously it depends, but I withdrew from kraken and it took less than 2 hours. I get that it's a little different since they can bundle 100s of withdrawals into one big transaction..but still. Eventually we'll get to the point where every transaction is processing payments for multiple people.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:13:54
Still at $1 everywhere as far as I can tell. Unless trading is suspended right now.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:42:04
crashing the BCH price with new coins would help out the BTC network lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:33:47
Are all of them circulating, or are some controlled by tether (meaning they aren't issued and don't need to be backed)?
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:44:35
Probably because the exchanges are specific to that country and don't allow foreigners to withdraw fiat currency.
I'd be surprised if ETH wasn't similarly inflated over there.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:14:09
Dawg don't daytrade with 100% of your investment. Haven't you read those posts about people turning 100s of coins into 3?

Mother FUCK I sold it all at 160
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:10:57
Yes, but if you have a decent amount of funds get a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:12:00
The situation you describe would *require* a certain amount of transaction throughout. If you don't have enough transactions to fill blocks, the fees will always be super low (the individual transaction has no incentive to pay a high fee, and the individual miner has no incentive to mine the blocks).
Empty blocks are the death of bitcoin. Expensive fees and full blocks are much safer.
The only time a block would be mined would still be when someone pays a high fee, then all the other low/no fee transactions would just get a "free ride" on that block. Not good. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:58:10
you're saying it's because propagation speed is limited by the size of the block? I agree that's true, but in practice I bet it would be pretty negligible. Pretty much all transactions would be included in every block.
I mean, up until all the recent craziness, zero fee transactions were getting confirmed after a few days. Obviously BTC miners aren't worried about trying to transfer bigger blocks than their competitors.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:52:49
The re adjustment wasn't the cause of the crash, it was bithumb going down. During that craziness I was trading BCH for BTC at 0.5 btc/bch. What a night.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:59:44
after you have sent BTC out of an address, it's supposedly slightly less secure (although I don't think this has ever been successfully exploited). No downside to receiving multiple times though.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:36:17
paper wallets: annoying to create securely, how are you gonna do that? hope you own a printer..and don't mind destroying it after..they store all kinds of data. making frequent transactions? better print out a TON of addresses and private keys, cause you can't re use any of em.
only HW wallet con: you better hope that the way they are generating seeds is secure, but I guess you could say the same about the method used to generate paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:29:38
Does bitfinex allow me to sell S2X futures without having bought any like Bitfinex? I'd love to keep trading mine, but got banned from Bitfinex because USA. I didn't the the option on HitBTC to split my coin into BT1 and BT2.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:32:47
Damn. It. I meant to get off my ass yesterday and sell b2x futures. Fuck me so hard.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:02:25
Sure, but now that BTC2 tokens are dogshit, BTC1 tokens can be sold for BTC at nearly 1:1. The small amount of BTC2 tokens I actually did sell last night I already bought back, combined with BTC1 tokens, and withdrew to a hardware wallet. It was an awesome profit margin, but on an unfortunately small amount of BTC
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:16:25
If you sold BTC on a foreign exchange, how would you get your money out?
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:02:26
most wallets don't support it. thank god for trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:07:07
11-15%?? Like every year? Fuuuck that. Keep your IRA and make your BTC investment separate.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:51:37
No I'm asking what the point of the fake hack is..I'm aware of what tether is accused of.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:37:23
Right now a $2 fee will probably get it into the next block, so you only have to wait the 6ish confirmations (~1 hour)
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:44:00
No way they'd be taking on that much risk. They'll hold actual BTC so they don't get reamed if the price explodes.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:38:21
Are you trying to spend the same coins from both devices? That might not be possible, not sure they use the same seeds or algorithms to generate wallets.
If you want some coins on one device and other coins on a different device that seems totally fine, but your keys / recovery seeds will be different for each device.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:06:01
That's like asking if you'd pay $2k to see next weeks lotto numbers. Might as well ask if I'd pay $2k to become a billionaire.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:35:55
No, they are working on solutions. Real solutions that don't require upping the block size every couple years, that is totally unsustainable.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:42:31
Buddy I sold most of my BCH for BTC between $1200 and $1500, it's kinda weird you took the time to read my post history..I disagree with most of the shit posted there, you should waste more time combing through my posts if you want to check.

Trezor has an article on what to do in this situation. Sometimes it's reversible.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:42:16
Supposedly they do post audits.
The more I read the sketchier it is though.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:04:48

@_date: 2017-11-12 08:42:50

@_date: 2017-11-21 19:21:57
It's not lost though, it's sitting in one single address, so I don't see how that could be an excuse for not exchanging other tether that wasn't stolen. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:07:59
I sold like half a BT2..kicking myself so hard for not going all in last night.

@_date: 2017-11-23 01:12:42
Out of stock right now. If payment was with a credit card and I could cancel / dispute if it was a scam I might have given it a shot. Ah well.

It was at like 28 when BCH difficulty went up, and now it's at 25. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:06:44
You can't import wallets into the trezor. I did the exact same thing you want to do, here's what I did:
1. Import private keys into electrum, and send all the bitcoin to the trezor address. 
2. Import the same private keys into electrum cash or whatever it's called, send all the BCH to the trezor bcash address.
3. Don't throw away those private keys. If Bitcoin Gold actually launches then those keys will have your BCG.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:13:24
lol..you do realize you can move coins from any number of wallets to any number of wallets/addresses in a single transaction right?
Before you go there, I understand that the number of inputs / outputs affects transaction price, but unless you have tiny amounts of bitcoins scattered across a ton of addresses it really shouldn't be a problem to pay &gt;20 to move them into a smaller number of segwit addresses to reduce your future fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:53:14
Yes and yes (most of the volume is still on bithumb)

BCH difficulty would go to 0.9x, while bitcoin is at x, right? So in this scenario, BCH would need a higher price that BTC to be more profitable. GL with that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:17:31
honestly, just write down a recovery seed and put it in a physical safety deposit box with instructions. Set a beneficiary for your box. If you're extra paranoid, split it between boxes at multiple banks.

It's not all or nothing, I've been selling a specific dollar value of bitcoin every day for about a week now while still keeping the bulk of it. Having too high a percentage of your money in any asset is bad, and I'm not acquiring crap I don't need. I'm investing in other markets.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:03:49
Probably not depending on where you live. If it's cold and you use electric heating anyway then possibly, since electricity costs would be close to zero.

It's more than enough. Store your recovery seed well. It's super unlikely the device will be compromised, I keep a good amount in a trezor.

No there isn't, except that it's unlikely someone would pay $10 to transfer $1
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:00:50
Yeah I think it would help, but it's unlikely to happen any time soon, the BTC ticker is too entrenched. For wallets I could see it though.

Oh yikes, I didn't hear about that. Really doesn't bode well for bch

Paying for transactions doesn't cripple adoption. The idea that people need to be paying for their coffee in bitcoin (on chain) is completely batshit stupid. It's such an awful application of blockchain tech and it doesn't solve any problems with the current system.

Dam, thanks for the $80

Because if there are no transaction fees, or they are too low, there is no incentive to mine new blocks. Once the block reward is zero, 100% of the incentive of mining is transaction fees.
The less people mining, the less secure the network is. There *always* needs to be incentive to keep people mining.

You mean BTG? I think it was cloned back at the end of October so the forked coins have already been "distributed"
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:15:23
Most people on this sub will say price manipulation. Bithumb let's you pay a one time fee to get unlimited free trading, which makes manipulation on that exchange way way easier and cheaper. It's a very reasonable theory, but we don't have hard evidence for it afaik.

Losing profit is the same as losing money, not to mention the tax you'll be paying (hopefully). The people who lost 100s of BTC daytrading when the price was $500 were also only losing profits.
I'm not saying don't say trade. Gambling is fun, but don't kid yourself. It is gambling.

If these spam transactions are paying fees then there's not much of a solution. They are driving up fees and paying a ton of money to do so. It's not sustainable.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:17:21
nothing you can do, it's going to take forever. your coins are safe though (or, at least as safe as bittrex is).

..for buying pizza? Of course fiat is better, are you joking?
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:53:28
Bull. Shit. Kraken pays lower fees than that sending tens of BTC withdrawals out in a single tx. I checked.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:00:16
why the fuck would you store USDT instead of actual american dollars??? makes no sense unless you're avoiding taxes, in which case find a different place for that type of advice.

Why track nodes, you don't need node to cash out, most people don't run them.

I think people withdraw USD..they do the identity verification and all that jazz.

Agreed. I have no problem with setting a reasonable floor like 5 satoshi, but coming from him it's complete hypocrisy.

Link? And didn't the chipset thing require opening the case, and was never actually used successfully?

wow, do you have a link for that?

This can't be how Robinhood will work because (afaik) they aren't going to allow shorting on the platform. They also can't simply take the other side of the bet, because they'd go out of business if crypto moons. Chances are they will be actually holding the crypto, so it won't be a bucket shop.
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:58:35
You're missing the point, in the case of ETH it was barely even a hack. A user made a bad contract.
It's apples and oranges.

I'm not sure how transferring to your own name would work, but I know for a fact you can transfer to another brokerage from RH for a fee. It's like any other stock broker.

That's not how market cap works

Not true, it will track the price using futures contracts and will be *highly* regulated and transparent like any other ETF. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:07:00
No, unless you count the people doing arbitrage on BTC price vs the ETF price. Only the futures contracts are being traded (which also don't result in BTC being traded directly).

Right, because I'm sure the state of California totally had systems in place to hold this dude's crypto for him *eyeroll*.

are you trying to say that xmr doesn't use cryptography? what does that even mean?

Coinbase is pretty huge, and has to follow strict rules since it's in the US. No way they would commit fraud, that company has a lot going for it.
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:29:12
Great discussion. Rarely do you find someone arguing against proof of work that actually understands it. Even though I don't agree it's a valuable perspective.
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:39:19


They pay per byte, so why would it make any difference?
For exchanges / real users it's cheaper because they get to use less bytes for the same effect. If a spammer uses less bytes then they have created less spam, so not sure what the point would be.
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:17:49
Sure, but the vast amount of liquidity isn't people that buy and sell once every week / month / day. It's big players and bots who leave money on the exchange. I'm not arguing that what you're saying doesn't happen, but I bet it's negligible.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:45:18
There's a short for every long on futures contracts.
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:42:19
If you have enough BTC to make any sort of dent in liquidity it doesn't matter if the fees are $1 or $1,000.
