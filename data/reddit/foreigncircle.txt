They say you can but then come up with as many exceptions to the rule as their creativity allows

If you were actually sorry then you would follow up with another insult
Grow up

I understand this stuff better then you. Let's stick to the facts rather then throwing insults around


It really isn't, but I would love to hear why you think that is true. Please back up this claim


You are getting off topic or misunderstanding what I am saying. I'm not talking about the difficulty of installing one app vs the other. I'm saying: creating a lightning channel with dust is pointless. If you are sending small amounts to a new user then on chain is unreliable and lightning is not feasible. 
You need to create a channel with a realistic amount and doing so with a large number of users that probably won't use it is not realistic. No one wants to open a bunch of dead ends with their own money
This idea would oy work with custodial wallets and if they are custodial then what's the point?

Lightning doesn't work either, remember we are talking about on boarding new users. Setting up a lightning channel with only a small amount of BTC doesn't work well

A custodial one

You can't sent small amounts of BTC reliably, and they won't be able to spend the btc reliable
