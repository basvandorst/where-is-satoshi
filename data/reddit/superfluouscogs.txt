Yeah, I was totally with it until they showed the *amount* of their bitcoins fluctuating...

I think you misspelled a weird.
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:00:53
I see what you're saying for sure, thanks for clearing it up.

I'm doing the same thing here in the US. One thing I'd recommend is trying to network with groups on campus who are already organized(the liberty oriented/free market types). I'm working on a plan right now to hold an event coinciding with the new semester when all the students come back to town. I plan to have a team of event staff ready by then to offer free tutorials on wallet set ups, as well as informative flyers with links to basic services and resources. I also want to have several local merchants willing to accept bitcoin by the time of the event, and have a flyer with listings of their businesses to hand out at the event. I figure that offering them the free advertising will give them more incentive to accept it, and them accepting it will give more people at the event to take interest. I'm really hoping to make it a success, but its still in the begining stages of becoming reality. I've created a bitcoin meetup as sort of a first start, but I imagine things will start to move quickly as summer comes to a close.. 
Good luck in your endeavors! If you want to kick around ideas perhaps we could help each other with this, so feel free to PM me if you want..

Or they could pre-load coins to a bus app on their smart phone and use the app to transfer them..

I wouldn't say that people didn't have at least *some* idea that Gox was a dump before the most recent announcement.

Any details on the POS system being used here [u/acityinohio](
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:58:35
I was curious if that was the case or not. I'm not too familiar with the point of sale systems, but am wondering which one's are BTC friendly.. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 02:04:52
So does offering a fellow bitcoiner something of value.

It would have made sense if they'd have said 'M.T. Gox' instead of 'bitcoin'.  People with Goxcoin are the only ones really hurt by this in the long run. Still a great comic none the less...

This is something that really needs to be reitterated. I hate to see people getting into major trouble for such rediculous charges.

Next month, we'll be buying military contracts!
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:55:49
That is what it seems like. I can tell you with certainty that my thoughts are primarily about the latter..
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:54:14
I just spent way too long thinking about how someone can act like they should be shot. I'm with you though.

Explain how it is stolen money. The seller would only have taken less of a hit by selling before a further crash. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:16:02
I am taking it as a joke yo.. So yes I did find it funny, but no, it still doesn't make sense from my view.... 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:50:26
And anyone who is paying in bitcoins has the incentive to be earning them as well, as it eliminates the extra step of converting from fiat... 
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:40:19
As someone in the US, I'm wary of such a plan. While I realise regulations are different everywhere, here in the US I think that setting up a stand and advertising such a service would classify the proprietor as a money transmitter and thus liable to comply with anti-money laundering and know your customer regulations.. I'm no expert on the details, but want to send out a warning that such schemes may ultimately lead to huge consequences.
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:57:19
I want to sell my stuff for bitcoin though. Do you offer that service as well?
