Apple doesn’t use your real credit/debit card number and doesn’t track what you bought or who you bought it from. I believe the device-specific number is stored in the iPhone’s secure enclave, so neither random apps or malware can get to it. You can read all about the Secure Enclave and the rest of the iOS security story via [this PDF](
DropBit + Apple Pay seems to be one of the least bad ways regular people can start with bitcoin.

That was the person’s Apple Pay name, etc.
Because Apple already knows who the user is, DropBit doesn’t need to KYC the user.

After taking the red pill and realizing the truth about fiat and how we’ve been duped into believing it’s real money, this is a happy moment coming into the real world.

Only the LN wallet is custodial; the bitcoin wallet is non-custodial.

By market cap, Ripple is second only to Bitcoin in value at $348,703,033:  the last 24 hours, Ripple has done nearly $7 million in transaction volume: 
So yeah, it’s being used.

Not that it matters to most of you, but what I believe Ripple CEO was attempting to say is that there isn’t a lack of currencies—we have plenty, with more being created every day via alt coins.
As amazing as bitcoin is, it’s not a great currency; it’s a much better store of value for all of the reasons we already know: slow confirmation times, no built-in way to exchange bitcoin for fiat, price volatility.
Like it or not, in order for cryptocurrencies to become mainstream, there needs to be a seamless way to connect with the legacy banking system. I know, many of you don’t want or need that, but that’s not how the average person feels.
What I find sort of funny is that there are so many projects that reinventing Ripple’s core features, like a decentralized exchange, faster confirmation times, multi currency wallets, the ability to pay anyone in whatever currency they wish even if you hold bitcoins or another cryptocurrency. Oh and smart contracts, which were going to be built into Ripple but now live as [Codius]( the currency agnostic platform for smart contracts.

Pretty freakin’ hot.

More of the same we come to expect from the majority financial "experts"—it's just a bubble; nothing to see here. Oh and by the way, Bitcoin is going to $0.
More claim chowder.

Yes, lets switch to Android, a far less secure platform to use for bitcoin transactions. I'm sure the nice people creating malware for Android (79% of all mobile malware [targeted Android in 2012]( will certainly make an exception to not steal your bitcoins while their programs rummage through your phone.
The fact that at least [$50,000 of bitcoins have already been stolen]( due to a security vulnerability—that must have been a fluke or something. I mean, it's not like [malware apps ever make it into the Google Play store]( or anything like that.
The whole having a tantrum thing because Apple won't allow certain kinds of bitcoin apps until they put features into iOS 7 to handle bitcoins safely securely and switching to a platform that's [demonstrably insecure]( for handling bitcoins?
Good luck with that.

Nope—Ubuntu also runs on ARM:

Just to be clear, Google isn’t backing OpenCoin; [Google Ventures]( is. GV is under Google but they have a separate management structure and are supposed to be autonomous from Google.

*Generally speaking, you don't have to worry about malware with either platform. It's true that there are more opportunities for attacks with Android, but with a bit of common sense, it's not likely to ever be a problem for you.*
I just want to make sure I'm reading this correctly—people are talking about dumping their iPhones because Apple (so far) hasn't allowed apps to send or receive bitcoin.
And the alternative? Android, a platform where there's already been a theft of 55 bitcoins (value: $50,050) due to a [security vulnerability that was exploited]( You can't make this stuff up.
 
Android is far less secure than iOS. In 2012, [79% of all malware targeted Android]( only 0.7% targeted iOS. And because of the massive [fragmentation of the Android platform]( operating system versions, devices, etc.) there are many more vectors for attackers.
The fact that Android is less secure and users are much more at risk to attacks and malware is kind of an open secret among tech practitioners; you know it's bad when Google Chairman Eric Schmidt claimed that [Android was more secure than iOS at a conference and was laughed at]( because IT professionals know it's a lie.
Even apps in the Google Play store aren't immune; [Blackberry had to pull a hacked version of the Blackberry Messenger app from the store]( it got there before Blackberry's official one did.
Dozens of malware and scam apps are routinely removed from the Google Play store, even though they should have never been there in the first place.
Apple gets that bitcoin is like cash—once it's gone, there's no getting them back. And until they come up with a feature for iOS to address that, they're not going put user's bitcoin at risk by allowing apps that store or transact them with no way of backing them up or something.
Seems like the responsible thing to do.
