My what now?
- Your lightning payment channel
I don't know what that is

No idea why you think Eth will get forket (more than others).

hmm that is not how that works.... 
You are in a vast echo chamber here. Fact is that more people are selling than buying. Aka more people fear the price is going down, than the amount of people who hope the price is going down. 
Aka, the majority is fearful

Bitcoin is simply not a good investment for the current price at the current time, but it not advised to sell either. Why even get worked up over that? Or do you really believe it should have an A+ rating? (Aka almost no chance of losing money)
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:29:09
That was not the statement I reacted to though. 
The question was, why are they charging that much. Then the answer was: "Conferences like this are always that much". I don't agree.  
Yes they charge that much because they can. I guess it is smart from a company standpoint, which is fair. Now though, I thought blockchain was going to make the world a better place. I don't think coindesk is close to bankrupsy, so if they really cared about revolutionizing and decentralizing the world, 500\-1K would have been more than enough per ticket. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:20:53
Bitcoin mining is impossible unless you put up a sizable stack of fiat to buy an ASIC, POS is possible with any amount of money. 
There are other potential flaws in POS, but leading to centralization is simply unsubstantiated rambling. There have been multiple studies showing POS is superior from a decentralization standpoint.

Most conferences that matter are expensive. Some are very expensive. Then there is consensus, which is overpriced. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 15:31:50
Dockercon, 1400 for 4 days, 350 per day
Microsoft ignite, 2400 for 6 days, 400 per day
AWS, 1700 for 5 days, 340 per day
consensus, 2000 for 3 days, 666 per day. 
I am not debating people \(esp in this space\) have enough money to pay the ticket price. I am debating "conferences like this are always that much". This is expensive. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:20:53

@_date: 2018-05-15 15:09:16


How is WWDC in the same ballpark? That is a 5 day conference for 1600 vs a 3 day consensus for 2K. \(aka little over 300 bucks a day vs 666 bucks a day\). If consensus would be equally expensive per day, it would cost half! \(960 bucks\). 
And I don't even think WWDC is seen as an average priced conference for the industry.

How is that a strawman argument? You literally just brought that up.... Read what a strawman argument is [
"Pay to surf" is only one part of Braves idea. Donating to your favorite streamer or youtuber without the middle man is another example.
Brave loads that webpage perfectly fine, without the "you are using adblocker" popup. So no, false.
Not really, just making an observation to see where you possibly came from.
Sure, and you will read above why brave is also far more likely to succeed than Pay to surf. Another point is the fact that we live in another time. Timing matters. People are fed up with google and facebooks privacy concerns. BAT is also decentralized. BAT provides more options other than Pay to surf. See how easy it was for me to point out the very simple difference between BAT and those failures?
Additionally, we are talking BRAVE here, a free browser, not BAT. Specifically we were talking about how brave does a good job blocking the mentioned popups. I said absolutely nothing about the payment part of Brave. You are coming up with shameful straw arguments here...
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:14:47
The fact that some idea was though of before doesn't mean it's bad. It is also not quite the same. 
Also, addblock clearly gives an additional problem loading these webpages. 
On mobile right now so can't check, but let me guess, you are a maximalist? This world is bigger then btc alone. 
Bitcoin is not the first attempt at anonymous cryptographic money either, but it was the first to succeed. See how doing something better that was already done 30 years ago can actually be valid? 
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:46:46
I would say that 1K is the minimum required to start mining somewhat efficiently, and in some part of the world that is not even valid at all unless you buy solar panels or something directly with your miner, which makes the initial investment huge. That doesn't scream decentralization for me personally. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:22:45


Oh really, that is the part your whole argument was based on? the word **thought?** Ok, then, let me rephrase that:  The fact that some idea was **tried and failed** before doesn't mean it's bad. I don't really see the difference here... You seem to be creating another straw argument here, by making it about one single word that doesn't really matter to begin with.
\&gt; That part isn't a business model; literally any cryptocurrency can support that. It doesn't require your token.
I don't think bitcoin could honestly. Additionally, brave/BAT is creating the software around it, nobody else is. It does require something. And since nobody is doing that something, the other cryptos can't do that right now.
\&gt;  There are adblockers that handle it better too. What's stopping anyone from including Brave's filter lists?
Nothing. It is open source.... What is your point here even? The browser does it job. It blocks ads. Why use their filter list if you could just use their browser?
\&gt;  I'm a long time bitcoiner who actually does use alts on occasion, which is why I've seen hundreds of scams just like yours. But my experience is irrelevant, this is about Brave/BAT.
No this is about how brave blocks popups and ads. You made a straw argument on BAT or pay to surf.
\&gt;  "This time it's different" doesn't help if the underlying arms race problem remains.
This is your only actual valid point, on the strawman side of the argument that is \(I was talking about brave and how it blocks ads, remember?\). This is a concern of myself as well, and I am eager to learn how BAT is planning to solve this. I think that one obvious solution would be to make ads give very very little money, which should be fine since you get 0 now.
\&gt;  No it's not. It was 100&amp; pre\-mined and runs on Ethereum.
Lol oh god here we go. Ethereum has been shown to be more decentralized than btc numerous times. But lets not go there. Lets agree to disagree there. We all know going into that further will get me banned here. \(yes I hold eth, but also btc\). premine doesn't mean a system can not be decentralized. I don't know where you got that idea.
\&gt;   Are you talking about the free rider donations? Literally any other cryptocurrency can do that.
No, for example I can pay a &amp; of the time I visit one youtuber in brave a &amp; of my monthly donations. No other crypto has that function. Also, ltc can do everything btc can, but still btc is the better investment. The fact that another crypto can do something, doesn't mean it can do it better, or that it is more valuable.
\&gt;  I appreciate that *now* you've at least tried, but those differences aren't accurate and don't solve the problems that made it unviable last time.
Please provide arguments on why they are not accurate. Stating they are not accurate without any meaningful argumentation is utterly useless.
About your \*now\*... You are a really sad debater honestly. You come up with a strawman argument when I talk about the amazing ad blockin capabilities of brave. And then attack me because I didn't foresee your argument on pay to surf? Wut bro? Like you even tried with your "bat is premined and on Ethereum" comment. Or your "shameful strawman attack because I used the word "thought instead of "tried"".
\&gt;  I'm talking about both because Brave depends on BAT, and they make their advertising revenue from Brave's users. But please, continue your discovery of what a strawman argument means.
It really doesn't. I don't use any BAT. Heck, I barely hold any \(less than 1&amp; of my portofolio\), but I stil use the browser and love it, especially on mobile. But please, continue your discovery of what a strawman argument means. **The fact remains we were talking about brave and how it blocks ads.** Also, stop cherry picking on my arguments you actually \(think\) you have a counter to. And keep the sneaked in ad hominem to yourself.

What? 2K is hell of a lot for a conference. 300 is a cheap conference, 500ish is a decent price. Going up to 1K is expensive. 2K is overpriced.

Even with lightning there is no point using bitcoin for small transactions unless you are going to make multiple small transactions to the same adres. 
Aka buying coffee around the corner of your work will be very cheap with lightning, buying coffee while visiting another shop will be more expensive with lightning than a regular BTC payment.

Yeah this circle jerk over not finding blocks has to stop. It is not a victory, nor a defeat. It is what was expected to happen. 
Victory for BTC is when the BCC hashrate decreases significantly after a few days or if the price of BCC get close to 0.

Nobody wants cash. That is like asking somebody whether they want 5 bucks or a winning lottery ticket bought for 5 bucks. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:14:01
That would mean what exactly? Would it be as simple as this in theory? (using arbitrary numbers, I don't feel like researching the exact numbers, and these are probably easier to use for example purposes anyway). 
Say you owed 400K bitcoin. You lost 100K bitcoin. 
So you only have 300K bitcoin to give. Instead of going into fiat and all that. You could give people 75% of their bitcoins (aka if you had 8 btc on exchange, you now get 6 back)? Would it be that easy? 
Honestly, that would be a super good solution, as then MtGox would basically have been a super strong forced HODL. Is it completely fair? probably not. But I don't think many would complain. You loose 25% (or whatever the exact % would be, after all costs etc) of BTC, but gain ~1000% on the asset worth. 
I understand your hands are tied, but would this be a possible outcome of civil rehabilitation? Or would it look like first, a part of the BTC needs to be sold to settle the people in FIAT, as that is the law, then the remaining BTC could be divided in a way as described above? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:15:49
Ah ok. Does that really make a big difference though? 
Probably very unfeasible as well though, with the legal stuff afaik. It will most probably just be a cash settlement on the price the asset was at point of bankruptcy, if anything else, it will probably be returning the assets (partially). Settling in cash the asset is worth today is very unheard of.
