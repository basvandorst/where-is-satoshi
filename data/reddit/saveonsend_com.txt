Of course not, please read the article. It is used for this global Ponzi scheme, but there doesn't seem to be, at least publicly, any attempt to identify and shut down related accounts.

Kind of. Same way as banks are shutting down suspicious accounts, what is preventing the largest Bitcoin exchanges to shut down accounts associated with those who send and receive money via MMM?

It is a commonly held opinion, widely shared by regulators and enforcement agencies across the globe. Addressing it with open mind and tools like Sabr.io is a prerequsite for Bitcoin survival

at SaveOnSend, we engage with frequent senders among migrants daily and made similar assumptions when launching, but after several months we had to change our opinion - consumers seem to like Western Union, while being aware of other options. There is always a choice: sometimes it might be a hawala and just couple other providers, sometimes - dozens... but we haven't found any victims yet. Some of users could save 50%+ by switching to another provider online but still prefer going to Western Union's cash agent because it works for them... And if Western Union vacates those small corridors where nobody else wants to compete, those consumers would be left at a mercy of hawala.

Few clarification points: 
Greece is a relatively small country from a remittances standpoint, both inbound and outbound, about 1/20th of top-5 countries
- inbound: &lt;$1B
- outbound: ~$1.5B
Technically, there are two ways to leverage Bitcoin in this crisis
- outbound: arrive to Greece with Bitcoins and locate migrants in top outbound remittance communities (Albania, Poland, Pakistan, Bulgaria....), then have your counterpart in the destination country with loads of cash to pay their families
- inbound: locate Greek migrant communities in top sending countries (Germany, USA, Australia...) and convert their cash into Bitcoin; again, your counterpart arrives to Greece with loads of cash to give their families.
If doing both inbound and outbound in Greece, there would be less need to have  cash there (i.e., "P2P" a-la CurrencyFair), but keep in mind that outbound-to-inbound ratio is around 3:to:1
Assuming Western Union's standard margin for cash-to-cash handling is 6%, let's say one wants to help Greeks for half of that margin: 3%. It means that in order to break-even on $10K in travel expenditures (to-in two countries, hotel...) one would need to facilitate above $350K in transfers before including taxes, licenses, local translators, etc.. (with average transaction size of $700, translates to ~500 customers).
This is not legal for an individual as the provider is required to have a money transmitter license (handling cash on both ends) plus follow AML/KYC compliance and there are legal limits on transporting cash in-and-out of Greece
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:22:32
If you have Bitcoin and your receiving party is ok to receive payment in Bitcoin, then a transfer would be virtually free and instant. 
Just fyi, banks are better suited for large amounts ($50-100K+) and transfers in same currencies (USD-to-USD to China or Philippines, etc.) - banks could also give you custom exchange rate for large amounts if you need to switch currencies. 
For $5K, a better option is to use a money transmitter like Western Union, MoneyGram, and Transfast.
Please update this thread after you complete a transfer with Bitcoin - would be interesting to confirm end-to-end steps, timing and costs for USA-to-China

Very important article. While anonymity is a preferred feature, it is simply not feasible in the current environment with focus on fighting terrorism funding and money laundering - tax evasion. 
The sooner Bitcoin could position itself as a government-friendly innovation that makes it easier to catch terrorists and fraudsters, the faster it would mitigate a a probable shutdown. Let's use blockchain to identify suspicious transactions more effectively than by monitoring cash-wire movements and that will be a gold PR for ensuring a more lenient government control and mass consumer adoption.

Balanced, accurate article. For the specific use case of Bitcoin for international money transfer, see our analysis:

Due to its size, Western Union doesn't have a "primary" base per say. Like the largest retail banks, Western Union has large market share across all consumer segments, both offline and online. Their online unit, called Digital Ventures, is the world's largest, much bigger than Xoom and no other provider comes close.
Would be important for a Bitcoin innovation if P2P players like Abra could avoid heavy regulatory burden till they have time to flourish. But it might be an unrealistic expectation with the growing focus  on fight with terrorism and money laundering (related to the P2P topic, did you see today's CA ruling on Uber?)

Hello Everyone, sorry, we just noticed this thread (there are few others about our article on reddit)
Thank you for the comments. We answered some points below and made some updates to the article. If you have any additional questions or think that we got any facts wrong, let us know.
More importantly, the best way to address any theoretical disagreement is for any bitcoin remittances provider to reach a basic milestone: 1,000 repeat customers among frequent migrant senders for any corridor in the world. When you find out that it happened, let us know so we could research and profile them.
@_date: 2015-05-26 11:42:38
There is a simple practical way to check if we indeed have any biases
- do our post contain any factually incorrect information?
- is our comparison tool omitting any low-cost providers?
If you read our post on Bitcoin, you will find rules for adding a bitcoin-based remittance provider to our comparison tool. We are ready whenever they are.

You are making an assumption that FX markups are the same every day, they are not. We discuss this in other blog posts if you are interested.
In short, FX markups changes daily with huge swings - you could see FX markups across providers during Q4,14-Q1,15 in another post specific for USA-to-Mexico. As the file name states, the snapshot you are mentioning is representative of April 1st, 2015. For example, on December 11th, 2014, their markup was +3.37%, while on April 3rd, 2015, it was -0.33%.
Their average FX markup for the last 6 months is ~1.9% but it   has been lower lately, on average ~1.7%.

There are multiple types of fraud - see our other post:  For so called "NSF" type of fraud in your example, you seem to be assuming an ideal world where customers send money from previously funded bitcoin accounts. For great majority of today's consumers, it is not a relevant consideration - "bitcoin" must be seamless for them in order to try it for remittances. Hence, a bitcoin-based provider needs to facilitate a seamless transfer for a consumer's bank account to fund a bitcoin account and then transfer money... which makes a concern about "NSF" fraud still relevant.

Such interesting topic, agreed that Facebook has a unique chance, but so much misinformation in this article and looks like the author has some personal issue with Western Union​ and MoneyGram​. The points are very intuitive, so it is not obvious that they need to be verified - would be still hoping for some basic check by Tech Crunch's editors.
1. "Bitcoin’s rise showed us how much demand there is for a globally accepted digital currency" - there is very little rise, basically "early adopters" only, so there is no demand for new currency... USD, EUR, etc. are doing as fine as ever with no change in sight
2. "All the things holding bitcoin back  —  merchant acceptance, instant transactions (bitcoin takes about an hour), and security " - those exist for any form of payment, what is holding bitcoin back is 1) lack of a superior use case, 2) insufficient funding: not enough to spend on mass marketing, PR, incentives
3. "However, sending money is expensive" - it is not, for top corridors, average remittance amount, online margins (fee + FX markup) is 0.5-2%, offline - 4-5%... consumers are generally OK to pay it and require heavy incentives in order to try an online sending method or to switch a provider
4. "The market is controlled by two companies  —  Western Union and MoneyGram  — which hold a duopoly over the global industry" - Western Union's share is ~15%, MoneyGram is around 5%. In each corridor, there are dozens of other providers. Yes, there are corridors within Africa where WU and MG have a much larger combined share, but volumes in those corridors are $1-5 million per year vs. USA-to-Mexico's ~$25 billion, or USA-to-India's $10+ billion
5. "The average transfer fee is more than 8 percent, but fees of up to 29 percent" - not even remotely representative of top global corridors, check for yourself with our app, SaveOnSend.com
6. "Long term, Facebook payments has the power to completely destroy Western Union and Money Gram (good riddance)" - no, 95% of global remittances are still offline and shift to online is crawling at low single digits per year... think of how many decades it took for consumers to embrace plastic cards vs. cash
Outside of simply loosing money to get a market share in remittances, which is a very challenging industry due to regulations and cyber fraud, there are objective reasons why Facebook would probably be the best contender for a shot to reach MoneyGram’s market share in the practical timeframe due to few unique competitive advantages:
– masters of localization: top providers still only have its USA site in English and Spanish while many larger ethnic groups among senders might strong prefer to engage using their native languages (e.g., Mandarin and Cantonese for Chinese)
– efficient customer acquisition: with margins approaching 0% for online money transfer (see table from our app below) while cost per customer acquisition is getting close to $50, leveraging its own massive global reach would allow Facebook to drive margins even lower burning competition
- sufficient “war chest”: with $10+B on hand they could buy up likes of Xoom, Ria Money Transfer, and TransFast to get international foothold and cherry pick best processes in those companies (e.g., risk management)
– spillover into “unbanked”: in some top remittance destinations, Facebook’s penetration is high enough to capture a significant portion of “unbanked” – Facebook could leverage this via local partnership to “cash-out” Facebook accounts.
One likely hurdle for Facebook would be around overcoming the “sharing-app” image of Facebook among consumers, especially in the 30+ age range (which is majority of remittance senders). While millennials seem to accept online “sharing” as part of life, among older categories, we have observed a somewhat irrational fear about others seeing their remittance information, e.g., in our comparison app  we removed the Facebook registration option after strongly negative feedback plus “who can see my information” has been the most frequent question from our users.
@_date: 2015-05-20 01:17:53
The article is trying to address the most popular "beliefs" about using bitcoin for consumer remittances, so its coherence is somewhat related to the coherence of those points. Is there anything specific facts in the article that you are disagreeing with? 
@_date: 2015-05-20 01:24:36
At least for consumer remittances, Bitcoin has been largely irrelevant so far. Recent innovation started with Xoom in 2008 which quickly gained a sizable market share in the online space - that pushed incumbents to get their act together in online as well, first for desktops and then for mobile. By 2013, the major innovation has been completed and we are now in the refinement phase. 
If you have any evidence to the contrary, please let us know.
@_date: 2015-05-24 02:25:58
What is the point of such tangential comparisons: how many people send $50 to Spain AND do it from a kiosk? 
In May of 2015, we don't have to nitpick on some marginal examples anymore. There is a great case study unfolding as we speak. It is happening in by far the world's largest corridor, USA-to-Mexico, with close to $25B in money transfers annually and growing at ~8% per year. Around 90% is still sent via cash agents, with average transaction size of ~$300, sent monthly by migrants. Two market leaders are Western Union and MoneyGram, with ~15% market share each. Their fees for this exact transfer is $8-10 and they charge 2-2.5% FX markup (i.e., their gross margin is ~5%).
There are 3 bitcoin remittance startups that seem to be trying to tackle this corridor, specifically sending money via cash and receiving in cash: Abra, HelloBit, and DigitalBTC. Let's wait till any of them get 1,000 repeat customers among frequent migrant senders to Mexico. If anybody thinks that it is easy, you are welcome to visit Mexican neighborhoods in California or Texas or NYC (116th and Lexington) and try persuading 1 person to send money via any of these 3 providers. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:56:03
Very interesting area, accurate title, and good intro, but too many statements are not reflective of the reality and, thus, require a factual support:
Remittance market is "...moving swiftly to digital"
- most of online remittance growth is from customers who previously used wire transfers (which could be considered "online" already)
- move from offline (aka, "cash agents") to online is actually happening at single growth digits, 1-2%
- yes, Western Union and MoneyGram's online businesses are growing at 15-20% per year, but it is because they are starting from a much lower base
"A typical money transfer costs up to 10% fees"
- online, top corridors, typical amounts: margins (FX markup + fee) are 0.5-2%
- offline... : ~5%
"Some of these new companies are operating under a P2P model"
- they would like to, but, unfortunately, top global corridors are highly imbalanced (e.g., USA-to-Mexico: ~$25B, Mexico-to-USA: ~$1B)
- hence, a provider like TransferWise tries to apply P2P globally, but it could only be really relevant for a small sub-set of corridors
"...Bitcoin could even lower fees..." of online remittance
- Digital arms of incumbents or online-only providers like Xoom and TransferWise spend relatively little on back-office costs to maintain ledger and physically move money
- This doesn't mean that something like "Ripple" couldn't be useful, but it is unlikely to provide a strategic cost advantage
"BitPesa has recently raised $1.1 million to ease bitcoins transfer..."
- That round was actually to support a small business pivot where BitPesa seems to have had more traction
- That is a very different space from consumer remittances (not part of "$582B" quoted in this article)

Thank you for clarifying. Makes sense. After reading "Flash Boys" was also great to learn about Nasdaq's interest in bitcoin - will be interesting to see if they end up pursuing open-semi-or-close loops.
@_date: 2015-05-28 03:16:44
Thanks for referencing us. Actually, the bitcoin remittances space is quite sparse. There might be lots of apps, but with less than a thousand repeat users each. 
Winning market share is very expensive, and, so far, very few bitcoin-based consumer remittance startups got even close to $0.5MM in a seed round. Compare that with $91MM funding for TransferWise and $140MM for WorldRemit so far... when we hear about a consumer-remittance-focused startup raising $10+MM round, it would be a good indication that there might be a fighting chance for a bitcoin-based provider to gain a meaningful market share.
@_date: 2016-01-04 02:33:56
This article would have been ok in 2011-2012, but in 2016 one can provide actual insights rather than asking naive questions "have you ever met someone." There are enough companies trying to address those points, some of them have already failed (Beam, 37Coins), some are still fighting (Rebit, Coins.ph) and some are just getting started (Abra, Align Commerce) - why not analyze their performance and deduce to whom and to what degree Bitcoin matters? One can then discover 3 counter-intuitive facts:
1) "Have you ever met" painpoints are mostly there for the structural reasons (government regulations, currency volatility, corridors with small volumes)
2) Most of consumers are satisfied with their current payment choices and require massive marketing-PR incentives in order to try a new technology-provider
3) Bitcoin doesn't address key painpoints of established providers like Western Union or TransferWise (cyber-security, compliance, profitability of digital)

You could help your mom much faster:
a) With Western Union, explain to her that instead of paying with debit/credit card, she should always pay by linking a bank account. Her fee will decline from $15 to $10. She should also try combining multiple payments, e.g., for sending $500, Western Union charges $12, the same for sending $1,000 - check here: 
b) for this particular corridor, Western Union is not the cheapest provider among top players; it makes money both on these fees but also on the spread in FX (another 3%). Instead, your mom should try Ria Money Transfer which is charging only $3 fee for sending $150 and only 1% FX Markup - see more here: 
Bottom line, by sending money smarter and spending few minutes on price comparison, people like your mom could already save 50%+. Sending remittances using Bitcoin is indeed a fascinating topic - you might be interested in our detailed assessment: 
@_date: 2015-08-13 23:06:07
So Wences' 2 key arguments are
1) Using debit/credit cards provides a huge advantage over using cash
2) Bitcoin is much more stable currency than the ones in developing countries
Neither of those has been actually true. Plenty of well-off folks in countries like USA, Germany, and Switzerland prefer using cash and low-income consumers don't really care about plastic. In 2014, Bitcoin was the worst performing currency in the world. That is why, given a choice, literally almost nobody among 5B so-called "unbanked" would prefer Bitcoin over the Internet - you are welcome to ask, we did.

@_date: 2015-08-08 03:37:51
When article about "fantastic growth" doesn't include a single sales figure, it typically means that those would be embarrassing to disclose. The bar is very low - we just want to know if there are well-known online stores with 10K repeat Bitcoin customers who generate $1M/month in sales volume.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:16:04
This can't be a serious article? At this point, Bitcoin startups in USA are in the pilot phase, trying to find first 1,000 customers among frequent senders to Mexico. Cash is still 90%+ of all remittances from USA to Mexico, 14 years after Western Union launched a website. If Bitcoin remittances reach 1% of the USA-to-Mexico corridor in the next 10 years, it would be a huge success story
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:36:15
Bank-to-bank is $8... using credit card is the most expensive method and consumers get hit with finance charges, but 90+% of consumers link their bank accounts when sending money online
@_date: 2015-08-10 02:08:24
you are right in principle, but the deviations are much smaller than you are expecting. We have been tracking them daily since late 2014 and they have NEVER charged 5% or even 4% for Philippines nor 4% for Mexico, nor 2% for India, etc.
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:07:16
Hi, thank you for sharing the information. There are actually many more providers worldwide - we picked the 3 best known, but they are all in very early phases. There are also well-known Bitcoin remittance providers which don't use P2P model (Rebit, Coins.ph, BitPesa). Would be great if any of the Bitcoin-based providers reaches a critical mass. Good luck to AirTM!
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:34:32
much more expensive... WU's average global margins are around 5%: digital send is around 2% but via cash agents is around 7%
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:58:16
Typical for such stories is to throw in lots of unrelated facts and don't provide a consumer perspective:
- to move large amounts of money, there is already an immediate way called wire transfer. There are different categories of wire transfers, some take 1 business days, some take hours or could be instant. Depending on required speed, the cost could be $30-300 but for sending $1M-$1B it doesn't seem to be an issue
- to move smaller amounts, remittances by migrants, there are both offline and online options to do it instantly. Sending money via cash agents is usually instant and providers like Xoom and Transfast support instant transfers from a linked bank account. Most providers offer an instant transfer when a customer uses a debit card
- Costs have been on a steady decline. The global weighted average cost for remittances is now around 6%, but for digital send in some top corridors it could reach 0.5% including fees and FX markup (e.g., USA-to-India)
More importantly, consumers of x-border remittances are pretty happy with their choices. Actually, so happy that 90% continue using cash agents, although they could save 50%+ and time if they just switch to sending money digitally with the same provider.
Yes, so-called "full bitcoin" would be an innovative solution, but there doesn't seem to be enough problem among potential customers for a mass adoption to happen on its own. It costs $50 to acquire one remittance customers and unless we start seeing Bitcoin consumer emittance startups raising $10MM+ not much traction can be expected.

well, for $2,999, it translates to 0.3% - we were surprised by how low it was and decided to share 
@_date: 2015-07-02 02:10:01
There are a few additional nuances
1. 40+% run-up in stock prices since early April seems suspicious considering that Xoom had an awful Q1 performance - seems like a potential leak of pending acquisition
2. Xoom has been struggling - in Q1, it is YoY volume growth dropped from 49% to 6%. It was losing market share in the world most prominent digital corridor, USA-to-India. Xoom had to cut its margins in half there vs. its other corridors and it wasn't enough, so it recently dropped margins another 30%.
3. Xoom's does not have "presence" in 37 countries per say. It is only serving USA outbound customers. Yes, it has agreements with intermediaries or even local partners, but it is obviously not the same as being on the ground like Western Union, MoneyGram, Ria or TransFast
4. X-border consumer remittances is very tough space where customers are generally happy with existing options. Makes one wonder if Dan with his Amex background really understands what he is getting into
5. Ironically, for all the talk in press release about how expensive remittances are, Xoom is one of the most expensive providers in the online space.

Overall informative, but it is pity that Bitcoin remittance startups are so secretive about their performance stats. Why not disclose, even if it is a small number like 500 repeat users or $500K/month transfer volume? 
@_date: 2015-07-28 04:03:13
USA-to-India is the world's most advanced remittance corridor. Margins (FX markup + fee) are 0.5% for cheapest provers lIke Ria, MoneyGram, Western Union  (find best with our comparison site  
Bitcoin can't compete with that if you are exchanging fiat-to-fiat. Would be different for full Bitcoin of if you were sending money to Philippines. Same providers are charging 2-3x more in that corridor. Btw, that is why we see Abra, Rebit, Coins.ph targeting that one and not India.
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:52:10
It is a real pity that such articles never include information about users, revenue or any growth metric. It is because those are probably very small, but at least we, as a community, could be then learning and not repeating same mistakes. 
Based on this article, it seems that BitPesa is still far away from capturing 1% market share in 1 corridor: UK-to-Kenya. But would be more helpful to understand if they at least have 100 or 1,000 repeat users among Kenyan migrants in UK.

Poorly researched article when it comes to Bitcoin for consumer remittances
1. Using 2005 remittance prices: in the last 10 years, there have been a fundamental decrease in margins. For top corridors, online margins are approaching 0% - for example, check for USA-to-India with our comparison app
2. Assuming balanced flows: P2P only works if there is a balance of flows. For consumer remittances, the flow in top corridors are fundamentally mis-balanced (e.g., USA-to-Mexico: $20+B, Mexico-to-USA: $1B), so there would be also a need for 3rd party to buy/sell bitcoin, adding extra conversion step and sometime even two steps (like when sending money to China and Philippines, USD-to-USD).
3. Assuming that cash disappears: cash remains and will remain the predominant instrument to send-receive remittances, the shift from offline-to-online is happening at a crawling pace. Bitcoin innovation, if there is one, is on a back-end
4. Existing providers have significant costs-issues related to accounting of transactions: they don't, if you look at their 10Ks (Wester Union, MoneyGram, Xoom, Ria - Euronet), almost all of their costs are around customer acquisition, channel deployment, variable payments to banks, and compliance. That is where their main challenges are as well.
5. No need of intermediaries: the importance of Western Union, MoneyGram, Ria... is not just in responding to government inquiries related to terrorist and criminal syndicates financing; they are also on front lines when dealing with basic fraud (e.g., hackers take over accounts in good standing, customers lying that they didn't send money...)

following that link to MoneyGram's site or check  - sending with a linked debit card costs $0 fee and funds available in India within hours. Alternatively, you could send with Xoom when money arrive almost instantly but they charge around 1.5% for that (fee + FX markup)

Repeating a 20th century story that "Western Union" and "banks" are slow  and expensive will lead to lots of disappointment down the road. In 2015, consumers are generally happy with "Western Union" and their "banks" - achieving even 1% market share in any global corridor would be a huge challenge and require $10MM+ in funding... look at a  limited growth of existing startups like RebitPh or BitPesa. This is very hard, especially, if one is dismissive of market leaders.

Hello everybody, thank you for thoughtful comments on our post! 
Just to give you some personal context, 6-9 months before founding SaveOnSend, we seriously considered launching a bitcoin-based remittance service together with one of the top bitcoin mining groups. As many still believe today, we also initially thought that "banks" and "Western Union" were taking advantage of poor consumers via monopoly of slow-anti-consumer service, that fees were relatively high, and that frequent senders were yearning for a better solution. After couple months of field research, we realized that our stereotypical view was pretty much wrong, and the space is too competitive (in other words, we are not capable enough to successfully play in it). We also estimated that we would need to raise around $100MM to get to a 1% global market share (see TransferWise funding so far or Xoom's pre-IPO) - it would still take around 5 years to get to such milestone with highly negative cash flow at the end - and we realistically didn't have a track record for "smart money" to make such bet on us. Therefore, we punted to a simple comparison app for now.
However, there are much more capable folks out there who could both execute and raise funds (imagine "dream team" of execs from WU Digital, Xoom, Uber, Airbnb) - when all of us see such team and learn that they raised $10+MM in the initial round, it would be an indication that there is finally some minimal chance for bitcoin remittances to become a contender few years later.
In the meantime, any milestone for bitcoin remittances is the success story, even if it is just 1,000 repeat users among frequent senders. Please write in the blog post's thread if you hear of such fiat-to-fiat provider anywhere in the world, so we could research and update our list.
Thanks again!

Dear Readers, thanks for the comments on our article! Two minor clarifications:
1. There is around 2% difference between average and weighted-average costs - only one of those reflects larger corridors and real send amounts
2. SaveOnSend is not sending money itself or get paid by providers for referrals. If and when Abra gets more established, hopefully in couple years, we will gladly add them to our comparison tables

We often get excited about an innovation and assume that others would share our eagerness to try it, forgetting that we often don't represent an average consumer. International remittance is a very tough space, just look at revenues of "hot" remittances startups after several years.
For example, USA to Mexico is by far the world's largest remittance corridor, but it is still mostly cash-based. Frequent senders with a bank account and smart phone could save 50%+ by switching  online with Western Union, Transfast, Ria, but still prefer to use cash agents. In this context, to advance a Bitcoin-based remittance service would require huge marketing efforts (SEO, PR, ads, referrals). See more on Mexico here: 
A better focus area might be the USA-to-India corridor which is already mostly online, but there the margins are already close to 0%, so a bitcoin-based provider would have to offer its services for free AND still invest huge amounts in marketing... otherwise, bitcoin-based remittance would still have 0.0...1% market share in 10 years.

Title seems to be a clickbait or wishful thinking - article doesn't even try proving that there is an actual disruption. If you look at Western Union's revenues or stock prices, you wil see that they continue rising. For USA-to-Philippines, WU indeed doesn't happen to be the lowest margin provider (those would be TransferWise and Ria), but they could decrease prices if their market share gets threatened. Compare Western Union's margins for USA-to-India corridor on our site - they are one of the cheapest.

We hear of "hundreds" of repeat users, but no supporting facts. If somebody hears of a startup breaching 1,000 repeat users among migrants, let us know so we could profile them on our blog, thanks

that is included in the post description, in this case they are giving a higher exchange rate to retail consumers than they could get on interbank market, check it for yourself

debit card - instantly to hours; 
bank account - Xoom can do instantly (risk management, bank integration); others take days

More apt title for exactly the same article might have been, "30 ways of how wishful thinking and ignorance prevents Bitcoin from making real progress". What is the point of self-congratulating ourselves to such extreme degree with "changing money forever" if to businesses and consumers at large disappearance of bitcoin tomorrow would be a non-event? Why list 30 ways instead of just 1 but getting it right, so an outside of the bubble person could actually find it realistic and insightful?
Continuing writing 20th century observations that it takes "at least a day" to wire $10000 or that Western Union is very expensive demonstrates to outsiders that an author didn't even bother to spend 1 minute on a basic research before publishing an article. There are now sites like ours,  where you can get such information in 15 seconds. Or actually visit:  - there might be 30 ways in how 10 minutes on that site could change view on bitcoin future forever.
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:25:20
Typical fallacy of such articles is repeating 20th century dogma about expensive incumbents: "bitcoin’s fees are much lower than those of traditional money transmitters such as Western Union." Reality of 2015 is that Western Union's online margins are competitive, and for some corridors, like USA-to-India, one of the cheapest. Yes, for transfer of $20, cash-to-cash, WU could charge 30%, but to do it cheaper considering cash agents-related and compliance costs would be very difficult.

Big difference if you want to help or want to promote BTC - help is easy, just show them how to link their bank account to a mobile app of any top providers like TransFast, Western Union, MoneyGram, Xoom... you could find the cheapest on our site... Boom! After you spend 5 min with them, they will be saving 60-80% starting with the next transaction.
After they do it for 6 months, then approach them about BTC, but prepare to "sell" as the price difference between sending money online vs. via BTC is minimal if they use the cheapest provider like TransFast. Focus on sending side to practice - receiving side conversion to online and then to BTC will be much harder... see more on bitcoin for international remittances here:

In this context, it is the same - what providers charge (fee + FX markup) for moving money from A to B is how much it costs to customers
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:33:52
Seems like another PR article without much research-substance.
1. To call something a "killer" app, or even "more killer", one has to show some growth number - otherwise, it is empty talk
2. At this point, we are not aware of a single global Bitcoin remittance provider which has 1,000 of repeat users among frequent international money transfer senders: migrants from India, China, Philippines, Mexico. If you know, please respond with details
3. Western Union has ~$6B in revenues, 15% market share, no provider comes even close to "taking on" them and nobody will for decades, all potential disruption is happening among well-off users in the online-to-online channel. Which is a tiny share of the market, and it is growing not because of unbanked but because of well-off consumers moving away from wire transfers
To see how tough is to compete in international remittances, research online-to-online money transfers from USA to India - margins approaching 0%
@_date: 2015-04-04 13:25:15
from recent entrants in USA's international remittance market only  is competing on price; there is also  but they are more expensive. at this point, not aware of a single bitcoin-based provider which could do seamless fiat-to-fiat from USA to India (i.e., USD-to-INR) - do you know of such company?
@_date: 2015-04-22 11:47:11
Margin 0% is the same as cost to consumer - i.e., full cost of sending money from point A to point B. Here is our understanding of Bitcoin for remittances - let us know which facts we are missing:

More to come, unless we start seeing $5-10M rounds - it takes $50 to acquire a remittance customer, bitcoin or no bitcoin. Remittances providers that have shown traction in the last few years all raised $20-150M (Remitly, Azimo, TransferWise, WorldRemit). Here is why Bitcoin remittances are even more difficult/expensive to scale:

we didn't write this article, just shared the link; our opinion on Bitcoin is here:  - if it is missing any facts, let us know

This is a seminal moment for Bitcoin for remittances. Whether you are a believer or sceptic, for the very first time there is a startup with sufficient funding to acquire 100K+ customers. It will be another year before we start seeing results, but $12M buys Abra 2-3 years or runway. The paramount question in the meantime is whether regulators in USA, Mexico, and Philippines would block Abra's core claim of being a technology company (it helps Abra to avoid spending on money transfer licenses and compliance).

Did you check before writing if Western Union has an instant service? Might explain why their revenues continue growing: 
@_date: 2015-04-12 02:13:50
ANYTHING helps... the needs to be a company in the next few years which achieves 0.1% market share in ANY global corridor, somehow leveraging bitcoin in the process... we could then learn and grow from there.

We are still sorting through top reasons, but it seems to be all around ingrained beliefs about money and, as you mentioned, long-term habits
- some feel that bringing money to a cash agent is safer than sending them online
- some view sending money as a form of pleasant sacrifice, so saving on such sacrifice seems emotionally contradictory to them
- some really like their cash agents, developing more than simple transactional relationship
- some feel loyal to providers that don't have offline option (there are fewer of those every year, but still plenty)
Overall, it seems to be a mistake to assume that a lower-income person should be more careful with spending than a higher-income one. We are not surprised when a middle-class person pays $4 for latte, buys duplicate clothes or has 2nd TV in their apartment and probably shouldn't hold people with less income to some higher standards of frugality, we are all humans :-) and we all seem to make our daily choices based on emotions rather than logic.
What do you think?

There are plenty of Bitcoin remittance startups already - why not invest $10M in one of them? See more on why investors will continue "talking" rather than investing:

There is so much outdated and unverified information in this article. It takes just few minutes to check facts on free sites like ours before publishing and then spend 1 hour in immigrant neighborhoods asking frequent senders for their opinion on embracing new channels/technologies. Repeating mantra that remittance incumbents are horrible, online is exploding and bitcoin remittance is killing it might make us feel energized in the short term, but unprepared for how unbelievably difficult it would be for a bitcoin-based provider to gain a minimal market share.
Here are some specific disconnects in the article
"The remittance market is plagued by"
- commercial monopolies: no, Western Union has ~15% market share, less in top corridors, MoneyGram is ~5% market share, the rest is fragmented
- outrageous fees: no, in top corridors, margins (fee + FX markup) approaching 0% for online remittances, see attached or check with our app, 
- opaque transfer records: no, both consumers and companies can access records in real-time
"The World Bank reports that the average cost of sending money through commercial banks is around 12 percent"
- of course, if you take $200 average transaction and divide it by a $25 wire fee; but how many frequent senders in the world are sending $200 back to India, Philippines, Mexico using a wire transfer?
"The global weighted-average cost of sending money through all channels is about 8 percent"
- weighted by number of transactions not by volume, in top corridors, the average fee is much smaller, e.g., for USA-India, it is ~2%. Yes, we have users who send $100 to Mexico via a cash agent and pay $10. But when we tell them about a less expensive alternative, they don't seem to care (most of them do have a bank account and a smart phone).
"But the adoption of mobile technology will see the digitization of remittances increase rapidly in the near future"
- unlikely: remember that plastic cards were invented 50 years ago, but in most of the world their volume usage is still below 30%
- the USA-India corridor is mostly online due to Indians in USA being  most educated ethnic group, 2.5X above national average
- other immigrant groups have smart phones already, but don't have nearly the same level of trust toward conducting important business (like sending money) online: habits take generation(s) to change
"bitcoin is starting to make a splash in the remittance markets"
- please find one provider that has more than 1,000 repeat fiat-to-fiat users among regular senders in ANY global corridor, we would love to profile this startup on our blog. In USA, such provider doesn't seem to exist yet.
- there are 100MM+ frequent international remittance senders worldwide - what would qualify as a "splash"... 0.001%?
In the Philippines, Rebit.ph reports that they had more volume in February 2015  than their entire volume since they launched.
- please provide figures for how many fiat-to-fiat consumers they had in February
Very important topic and super promising technology, and would be awesome to add a bitcoin-based provider to our app. But let's also face an objective reality of where we are today and what it would take for success.

Thanks qroshan!

Anytime somebody says that bitcoin would kill Western Union it shows real lack of knowledge about bitcoin or Western Union. 
Such topic should consider both company-specific and industry-wide dynamics
Company-specific (e.g., was Internet a bigger threat to WalMart or Target?)
- Western Union has been pretty good adapting to online evolution: compare their online engagement stats and online revenue to more recent entrants (publicly available in 10K and via interviews with their execs). As more large and well-funded providers are fighting for market share, Western Union has been thriving in the last 2 years with breakthrough in its Digital division and overall leapfrog in social media. And that is the biggest "blind spot" of proponents of recent entrants and bitcoin-based remittance startups. They have an image, a wishful thinking, that Western Union is a cash-only business which missed telephony and stayed with telegraph till 21st century.
- However, Moneygram has struggled in that space and is now finally trying to catch up
- Their stock prices are reflecting of said distinction
Industry-wide (e.g., is there some significant "value" in the remittance market that a new technology could disrupt?)
Let's first sort through a pecking order using 2014 revenues (current Market Cap)...
- Western Union: $5,6B ($10.1B)
- Moneygram: $1.4B ($0.5B)
- Xoom (company): $0.159B ($0.6B)
- WorldRemit: $0.025B ($0.5B)
- Remitly: $0.002 ($0.05B) - my best guess, welcome others to chime in
So after so many years, Xoom is still 1/30+th of Western Union. Why? Part of it is Xoom's online-only channel which has much smaller margins. I.e., their transaction volume in online for USA is probably 2-3 times higher than Western Union's. Another reason is the focused business model of targeting customers who value good service-technology and are willing to pay for it. Xoom usually has higher FX markup across other corridors. Btw, so far, similar model also seems to be the case for Remitly and WorldRemit while TransferWise competes more aggressively on price. 
So international remittances in top corridors is already a fiercely competitive fight for customers with razor-thin margins (for USA-India,  global destination - close to 0.5% total margin including fee and FX markup). As usual in such fights, to win a respectful market share would require much more than a technology and money, there needs to be a "dream team". Then, maybe, such bitcoin entrant could catch up with Xoom... in 5-10 years.
If you don't want to be perceived like a bubble community, it is important to have practical milestones that others could relate to. For example, you could target for any bitcoin-based remittance provider to reach 1% market share in ANY global corridor. If and when that happens in the next several years, it would allow everybody to understand why it worked and implications for global scaling.
