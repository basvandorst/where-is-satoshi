Yes you can, by making not being an asshole an option for more people. You can't expect all people to self enlighten. They live in a matrix of their own creation unable to escape without help and it might not even occur to them that they might need it or that if too proud, stubborn or otherwise unaware to ask others, they'd have to maintain the practice of asking themselves very different questions. Better ones. People don't want to be assholes. Not nature. Nurture. They just see themselves as victims or [insert another excuse here] and justify their actions. It makes sense to them to be assholes because, they have not understood the benefit in nor learned to see the world the same way as a non-asshole.
Basic income also teaches you not to be an asshole and to see the value in it. You can learn the lesson better this way. With a carrot.

It might be more peaceful than it was in the end of 80's, but not more peaceful than 10 years ago. I do recognize that thinking about worst case scenarios can worsen my outlook on life, but on the other hand people don't seem to react accordingly to events that need reacting. This leads to the situations getting slowly so bad that by the time people find their lives intolerable the result is violence. I would really like for things to resolve early on so that they can be resolved without violence and suffering. That's why I might sound a bit pessimistic. If people are suffering from mania isn't it ethical to bring them down to earth before they hurt themselves?

It could still prevent those too eager to push the button to do so. As for why, do you absolutely trust your government to do the right thing in a moment of crisis? Do you trust them in normal conditions?

I can't believe someone is really using the "this is the current state of things" argument in a non sarcastic way. The only constant thing in this universe is that things are always changing.

Yeah utility batteries won't do, that's for sure. You could for example improvise a pretty good vanadium redox battery if you get a couple of one cubic meter fluid containers(easy to stack and move) or more, a fuel cell and a pair of pumps that can withstand the sulfuric acid. If you don't want to pay for stupid expensive nafion(PEM prone to wear) you can just design a microchannel fuel cell [based on laminar flow proton exchange]( instead.
Making microchannel fuel cell plates would require some more advanced manufacturing technologies that are available today. The rest of the stuff you can find in a hardware store. These would be big batteries, so they could be used in a microgrid or households with enough space for them. It might be cheaper to use more advanced manufacturing technologies to make a negative mold for the plates and then mass produce microchannel plates.
If every household would be required to at least have a battery with enough capacity to provide for the power needs for a few seconds wouldn't it be possible to first charge the battery then use an inverter to power the house, sync with the macrogrid and then connect to the main grid without causing disruptions?
To me it sounds like the government and the communities that use the grid should be more involved in power production and grid maintenance like it is with roads. Not like I hear they have in the States, but like we do in Finland. We have a very well maintained roads.
It would be great if that extra power could be put into some useful work when it is produced in abundance.(Car battery charging station or aluminum hydroxide recycling maybe) Maybe there are opportunities for some sort of production that can vary production speed depending on the price of electricity.

Robots aren't sentient and therefore they cannot own. An android((if)/when they become a reality) is sentient and thus it/he/her(or however they identify themselves) should have the same rights as other sentient beings. Too bad we humans aren't very respecting of the rights of other sentient beings.
EDIT: Depends on how you interpret the word own though. If used loosely it could mean that the robot has access to money, but I wouldn't say the robot owned it as a robot is something that can be owned, thus the owner of the money would be the owner of the robot.

You would basically be opening the in-game economy in a way that would lower the treshold of moving value to and from your game thus attracting people who like playing your game but enjoys making some money too and those who like to "cheat" by paying for things with "real life" money.

I don't see the point in arguing what unit to use if you don't take into consideration that the prices will vary. It makes no sense to decide to use one specific unit. Just use metric unit prefixes. There's no reason to call 1BTC 1000mBTC or 1000000µBTC/bits. If the number seems huge use a larger unit, if you have a lot of decimals use a smaller unit. It's not rocket science and even the difficulty of rocket science is largely exaggerated.

@_date: 2014-11-21 07:13:58
Population growth is a problem that solves itself unless we solve it first. We can always add more decimals to the currency making it infinitely divisible. In a sense the supply is unlimited, but without the need for inflation. The value of the 21 million Bitcoins will adjust according to supply and demand. The more value is being created and is being transacted with bitcoin the more valuable Bitcoin becomes. I would be more worried about how to deal with communication delays between planets when the time comes.
Taxes in some form will probably still be collected and UBI would be more efficient than current welfare which involves a lot of manual work like checking forms etc.

If you're going to have to get something anyways, you're going to use whatever store of value you have in order to get the goods that you want. Fiat, Bitcoin, stamps, seashells. If you like, you can exchange any currency to Bitcoin and then use those coins to make your purchase.

I'm really pessimistic about a lot of things, but the fact remains that the more people understand Bitcoin the more they support it and see it as something to put at least some faith on.

Becoming a bigger monster than the one being fought could be a problem. It has been so in the past. The ones funding would be the monsters then. Nigerian government's stance on the whole thing is not something that we can have absolute certainty of, especially if all the funding is being done by people all over the world. The militia committing unsanctioned acts can be a problem as well. There would have to be very strict guidlines on what goes and what doesn't.

Of course. Just like it's very natural to talk about millis, kilos, tonnes etc. in construction work for example. If those guys can do it so can the general population. It's trivial to input and output numbers in a readable range and with reasonable units too in any system that handles numbers.

Infnitely divisible currency is not inflationary. It's not unlimited in quantity. You just can divide it into infinitely small amounts. As the market cap of Bitcoin goes up when Bitcoin economy grows then would the value of one satoshi go up as well. Adding decimals is not the same as moving the decimal point.
There will be income inequality in the age of UBI as well, most people would like to have a purpose. That generally translates to a desire to work. Income inequality is not required for the economy to work. If I grow potatoes and you make synthetic meat we have to trade in order to get a balanced meal. Naturally I'd like to increase the sales of my potatoes and I could pay a graphic designer to do some work on the layout of my website.
With UBI everyone does not have to get an equal amount every month. The amount you get should be dependent on the living expences in your area. It should be variable based on an indicator like Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare. The amount should be automatically adjusted so that reasonable living expences in your area will be covered. It shuldn't just be a number decided by a mere human. You shouldn't just decide that people get a fixed amount of money when the value of monetary base itself is not fixed. Also, you could pay UBI every day if you paid with Bitcoin.
An expanding population needs expanding resources. If the resources are getting scarce the population growth has to be stopped to ensure decent quality of life for everyone. With UBI there's no reason to get a lot of children to support you when you're old. There's a strong correlation between higher education for women and reduced birth rates. Increase in the quality and level of education in third world countries can help us to put a stop to uncontrolled reproduction. We don't even have to limit people's freedom to reproduce if we just remove the incentives to reproduce in an unsustainable manner. In case we do learn to live peacefully we should migrate to other planets. If we don't I think it's better we never go export our way of life in the universe.
Natural disaster + brainwallets would mean deflation. M of N multisigs could protect from losing access to funds. If natural disasters and wars have the potential to hurt every one of us, we would have better incentives to make sure they don't happen or if they do, they will have less impact.
So I think UBI and Bitcoin can be compatible.

In Finland they did so when paying with the magstripe and they do  require it nowdays too. With chip and pin systems they don't. I guess they assume that if you know the pin, the card is probably yours.
In one grocery store chain they refused to accept my card with a non working chip but working pin even when I had my ID. They had this foolproof policy that's supposed to "protect" me.

Alternative approaches:

* 2. Leave GHash and possibly see the value rise while making only slightly less coins in quantity
* 3. Sell your mining equipment 
Strategy 1 gives no chance of success while strategy 2 does. A truly selfish miner who understands multiplication and statistics picks strategy 2 and invites others to do so too.
Strategy 3 might be a good option for someone who deems it too difficult to make profit outside ghash

And yes, you can decide to get your electricity from company X, if the price is better, but company X can chane their prices or company Y might enter the market and provide cheaper electricity.
What I'm talking about is a system where you don't even need to make an official contract to get electricity delivered to your home and you don't even need to know where your electricity comes from. Of course you should be able to decide if you want to buy only green energy or only coal or whatever.
The system I'm envisioning is one where the first clue that a grid failure occurred nearby could just be increased price for the areas that also used that part of the grid to get their power. You could sell and buy power directly to/from your neighbour by just connecting the two households together with some cable. You could own X percent of any power line and get a provision of the profit. You could buy the excess power from your neighbour, but fall back to buying the power from the nearby wind power supplier and if they are experiencing problems or the price has gone too high you could automagically buy and route the electricity from somewhere else.

This is a good thing. People will be more careful with their money and prefer trustworthy merchants more. This leads to scamming being less profitable. Also if you take the proper precautions, no one will be able to charge from your wallet without your approval. Just like with cash you wouldn't walk around with your net worth in your pocket, you shouldn't keep all your bitcoins in a hot wallet.


0 confirmation purchases are okay for day to day purchases. In my experience, paying with bitcoin tends to be even faster than cc if you do it right. It's a common occurrence that there's something wrong with the cc-network and paying takes a lot of time, a lot of tries and sometimes fails altogether. Then you won't even be able to get cash from an atm. Bitcoin is decentralized. If some nodes malfunction, it's highly unlikely that you will even notice it.

As a whole this is a way too big a problem for anyone, but if by creating the basic requirements to participate in energy transfer, storage or production we could lower barrier to entry something like this might actually happen. You wouldn't need to plan the entire network, you could just participate in the building and maintenance of the network in your local area. You could just be that one cell in a network that works like slime mold. If the energy you want is produced nearby it doesn't have to travel great distances, that's the beauty of decentralizing the power grid. Electricity doesn't have to flow uphill. Every power line would just have to deliver energy from where it is being produced in abundance to the direction where it is needed. What would create a need to "upgrade to latest fashion" every few years?
Naturally the big players are the only one's that can build the big cables, but if there's a way to profit from building smaller scale infrastructure too, there's bound to be people trying to take advantage of that opportunity. The big copper guys could get a big cut from the energy transferred, but that's only fair. There's also bound to be more than just one big copper guy and more than just one large power plant within reasonable distance. They would compete and bring the price down to a reasonable level unless they form a cartel. Then they could raise the prices to a level that competes with small copper guys, but they could not raise the prices higher without losing money. Attempts to rob people would only make it easier for others to enter the market.
It would not be that hard to build this kind of network parallel to the existing grid. You'd just buy the electricity from the line that it's cheaper to do so. You could also redistribute the power to someone else if there's a line and they're willing to pay your price.
For larger energy storage needs, molten salt batteries seem like a good idea. On a smaller scale, storing the energy as heat or by pumping water to a reservoir could work. Energy storage technology is progressing quickly and demand would hasten it.

Others won't fix any problem that wouldn't come up again. The most sustainable approach is to keep XBT as the base unit and use SI prefixes like they have been used everywhere else in everyday life.

Also when the price of bitcoin inevitably changes, people will have to use a different unit/prefix anyways.

Buying slaves is not the way to help people long term. I believe though that something could be done by an international community like us.
The hive mind says this needs to stop. No one nation can do anything about it without becoming a target themselves. We all must take responsibility equally. The only way to stop these kinds of things is to act from within. Incentivize change. Drive trust based systems to obsolescence. Create a global mesh network and drive the price for mobile devices to zero and availablility to all people on earth. Build in strong encryption and privacy features that cannot be defeated or disabled. Make education available globally.(People must be able to educate themselves in secret.) Build _private_ surveillance drones and deploy them in problematic areas. Decentralize power. Build infrastructure to ensure self sufficiency. Pay informants, reward the right kind of behaviour. Don't vote for people who are 100% sure that they are right. They are wrong 100% of the time. Question your own beliefs and reasoning. Question the beliefs and reasoning of people who have power. Do not follow orders. Don't raise your kids to be nationalists, raise them to be sentient beings who respect other sentient beings.

Legally you can. There is no restriction to the amount of alcohol you may bring in, but it must be for your personal use or for your family´s use. Just like in Finland.
The customs officers are being more difficult than the law dictates though. They're claiming the amounts that people are bringing couldn't possibly be for your personal use. Even if you travel to buy alcohol once a year for the entire year.
Harsh taxes have resulted in lot of the alcohol to be bought from Estonia or online from Germany. Also people go out in bars less often, drink more at home where there's no supervision and there are big caches of alcohol.

Some of these things we already know how to deal with and some I expect to be solvable with technical solutions. We know for example that war against drugs leads to more addiction. Denmark and other progressive countries have already shown a better way to deal with substance abuse humanely. People in cryptocurrency communities are generous and they spend a lot of time and effort to solve all kinds of problems. People with less problems aren't that likely to turn to crime. When you add to this frictionless crowdfunding, you can truly make a change for the good.
When people are free to choose they choose to be good. People in cryptocurrency communities and open source projects are changing the way the world works. It has only very recently started changing for the better. The internet helps too.

Buy and hold. Past experience may not be a definitive indicator for the future, but it's a pretty good one. There's point in getting into mining if you can reliably get a cost efficient miner quicker than others. Buying coins is almost instant. Buying a miner and then waiting for it to maybe arrive and then mining coins is second best and buying mining power is only the third best option, because you're paying a lot more because there are a lot of other desperate people who are willing to pay more for the bitcoin they produce than what it is actually worth in an exchange. People suck at math maybe? Also buying hashing power from a cloud mining service is a sure way to devalue your bitcoin due to centralized mining.

I admit I'm a bit optimistic. But in my defense we are in a defining moment in history where technological solutions are making existing regulation and establishment irrelevant.
It wouldn't need a complicated piece of hardware to make existing appliances cost aware and with some smart software you could really drive the price of energy down. Even with deregulation I think the problem has been that there are too few providers and the electricity market has not embraced full decentralization(including automatic routing, price negotiation and lower treshold for entry into the market), which I think could lead to increased redundancy. Home appliances are getting smarter by the minute, so therey're bound to be capable of being price-responsive too. With distributed energy storage technology the price fluctuations could be further reduced.

I've been participating in meetings where we've been discussing on how to implement UBI in our city as a test to show it's benefits and to get the rest of the country on board. The green party has also had a presence there. They've been advocating for UBI since the 90's. The Pirate Party is a young party, we're five years old now and the parliamentary elections next year will be our second chance to get someone in. We almost got a candidate elected the first time with almost non-existing budget and a lot of enthusiasm. We got 0,9% of the votes in Pirkanmaa and Helsinki. 1% in either electoral district would have been enough.
What I'm most excited about UBI is that it gives people freedom to act more ethically, because they can't be so easily coerced into – say – telemarketing or a job with lousy salary/benefits. It could provide a safety net that only people from privileged families have, even though they might never have to use it. Instead of punishing for entrepreneurship and working, it could encourage the people. And people who feel more grateful for what they have are more useful than one's that have had to fight for their social security payments and feel entitled to them.

Thank you for your feedback. It is very appreciated. I do try to educate myself as much as I can, but unless I change my profession entirely I don't think I'll ever accumulate enough understanding. I do understand electronics, but I guess it's a different kind of animal when you design a PCB the size of a country or planet with multiple ac sources, variable loads and malfunctioning components.
Of course we need hardware that can handle the electrical requirements and take into consideration the limits. I realize that there are a lot of technical challenges and we need to look at how they are being solved today and think of better ways of solving them in the future. Especially when there are potentially many people participating in a system like this the protocol itself should have to communicate things such as maximum capacities and limits so that the system refuses to exceed them. I'm not suggesting that someone plugs a generator directly into the grid and runs it at variable speeds, but as an example isn't it trivial to match the frequency, phase and voltage of the grid with an inverter? I'm interested in figuring out what changes need to be done with the existing infrastructure in order for it to be able to do all that it is required to do reliably – what would be the minimum requirements for a decentralization ready grid. Can programmable logic with communication capabilities (and maybe precise clocks/frequency standards) be used to overcome these problems?
Maybe we would still need "big copper" from time to time. Naturally one shouldn't expect better technology to be available than what is today, but greater energy storage capacity would make it possible to deliver power over a longer period of time and thus with less current and copper.
As people are already selling the excess power they produce back to the grid most of the problems must have been solved in some way for them to be able to do so or am I wrong?

Wasn't intended as trolling. In my opinion there's war brewing all over the world and at least it seems like it's getting more worrisome every day while people are in denial because they don't want to think it. Citizens are being oppressed everywhere and they are getting more and more angry about it. This kind of development has resulted in civil wars and wars between nations in the past. I don't see any other developments that would prevent history from repeating itself. Therefore I deem it likely that war is coming unless something unexpected halts that progression. That something has to be something that would alleviate the anger of the masses and it would require that those in power would make right by the people they are choking right now.

You would just have to load some BTC to your popcorn time wallet and accept the payment before watching.

The price would have fallen a lot faster and would be near zero without support. The smart one's are the one's buying their way down and profiting from the following rise.

In the 90's when I was like 11 years old they had this kind of "security" on the local area network in the library. I could have emptied the entire library.(I didn't. What would be the point.)
* Step 1: Borrow some books.
* Step 2: Edit the non-encrypted open database and remove any mentions of you borrowing the books.
* Step 3: Goto step 1
I was checking out the db-software and left some files laying on the system. They investigated, then the police investigated(unlawful use or something like that) but because it was wide open and maybe because the embarrassment that they got pwned by a child, the municipality decided to drop the case.
Had to explain to the police using simple words. The db was like a building without a door.

I would say that it's more having seen the same cycle repeat itself over and over again. Every time the price has been going down there has been bitter people, who have just invested. They panic, they complain, they say it's all over. Bitcoin still keeps getting better and better growing and maturing. I've read Satoshi's whitepaper and I understand it. You may call it rose colored glasses. I call it understanding how crazy valuable bitcoin is becoming each day. As I see it. The prices on exchanges do not represent the real value of bitcoin.

BTW does someone know an opensource method/software for detecting doublespend attempts? That would make life a lot easier for a merchant. I assume it requires multiple nodes and something that calculates the probability of doublespend succeeding. 
You could do all kinds of fancy stuff with doublespend detection. If the probability is too high, don't release the product to the customer. It's then the customers own fault if they want to mess up their transaction. On transactions where probability is low you might acquire insurances(automagically) for that sum and if the transaction fails some insurances will pay by the terms agreed upon, which may vary. This would give a great incentive for people involved with insurance businesses to develop risk assesment services although those would be centralized services. It might also give an incentive to improve bitcoin itself as long as the improvement does not lead to them losing their income from insurances.

Here in Finland the housing market is in an insane bubble, the government is doing all they can to stop people from earning a living and spending what money they have on things that generate taxes. Even the refugees cannot help clearing the snow because it is basically forbidden to shovel snow without a permit. And they are even willing to do it without any pay.
Uber-drivers are getting fines for not having taxi licenses. I'm glad they continue their work as it is necessary for new companies to be able to provide similar services and to provide a competetive market where one can also do deliveries between Uber-rides, thus making it a more secure form of employment than depending on just one company.
The government is loosing money by reducing the funds used on investigating tax evasion. This is probably the most clear signal that they are either corrupt as hell, stupid beyond belief or both.
Our defence minister's rhetoric is very disturbing to anyone who values peace and he repeatedly declines to comment on his actions. He has actually threatened to walk out of an interview because the reporter had the audacity of asking reasonable questions that he would be obliged to answer. Our foreign minister is a xenophobic child. Our minister of finance has been caught lying to the parliament multiple times and is known for manipulating the media. Our prime minister is so lost, he might as well be in another galaxy.
It's amazing the country is not in flames. Without it's citizens current level of education and values this country would surely not survive. It is really worrisome that our prime minister has been using derogatory terms when referring to academics, the universities have had huge cuts and are now forced to let go a lot of people and also lower it's standards of education.

He demonstrated a vulnerability that is not being addressed properly. Someone has to do this if people fail to fix the problem. Doing otherwise would be willfully letting people down the line suffer the consequences. It's not like he took the money and ran. He's been very vocal about the matter. Not being able to trust that a transaction cannot be reversed is an enormous flaw. It would be very bad for all of us if this was left unaddressed. Bitcoin is very much about eliminating the need for trust. Trust is transfer of power and a bug that introduces errors in the system. Human errors cost money.

Well – facts can be picked and presented outside their original context. I also don't see any valid reason why anyone would give in to such demands especially if one hasn't been doing anything nefarious.

There's a lot of people in Finland using their data 24/7 as much as their 4G LTE can carry. The result is more and more operators are providing unlimited data and they're expanding 4G LTE to rural areas so they don't have to lay cables there.
This is still not enough for many users and they're building their own fiberoptic networks even in small villages.
 The operators seem to understand that the days when they got to charge insane prices for plain phone calls are soon over. If they don't change with the times and focus on providing as fast data as possible, as much as possible and as affordably as possible they're going to be wiped out by the competition.
In countries where mobile operators aren't doing this I suspect there are either too few competitors or they've formed a cartel.

@_date: 2015-09-01 14:50:05
If in the future the miners start to vote for lower blocksize and the voting implementation is as suggested by BitFury there probably is a good reason to lower the blocksize.
Because bitcoin adoption itself is unpredictable the network needs to scale in order to function efficiently while also responding to demand in a way that doesn't lead to ridiculous transaction fees. Scalability leads to predictability in confirmation times.
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:25:54
They imply data is unlimited. It's not their business to even know if it's used for tethering. Data is data. If you advertise unlimited you provide unlimited and if you have problems with capacity you build more capacity or raise prices because clearly there is demand. I have no problem with them providing plans like this, but they should be honest about their marketing claims as well. And no it's no excuse that they tell it's limited in fine print.
They're being dishonest and then complaining that so are their most demanding customers.

Of course reviewing every line by yourself is not very practical, but there are some people here who do read source code. They wouldn't be able to do so if the source was closed. I only run open source software because that way the code I run will be more reviewed by users as well. To be honest, having to worry about foul-play by the producers of closed source code is too much of a hassle and I'd like my life a little more boring. Volkswagen, baseband firmware, windows...

I'm paying for unlimited 4G LTE in Finland. Costs 7,90€ to have it for just one week or 16,90€ for one month. They market it as unlimited and it is unlimited as expected. No bullshit about tethering or anything.
If I don't pay for the data package I still get 4G LTE bandwidth and it won't cost more than 1,92€ per day no matter how much I use data.
I've been buying the monthly unlimited 4G LTE for a while now. Sure it's a bit expensive, but that's to be expected of an unlimited high bandwidth product.
So there are other companies out there, but maybe you have to live in another country where your mobile operators actually do their job and meet demand instead of whining.

The fact that it's not a requirement to store n amount of transactions makes it more likely that some transactions won't end up in a block. Nobody's going to invest huge amounts of money for something that is not really required. Tragedy of the commons. The network as a whole would be less reliable.

Yes it's an oversimplification. I know very well that a promise is worth a lot less than a private key that is valid for spending valid outputs.
It'll take time before the average Joe understands the difference. However he can now buy GBTC thus putting pressure on someone to actually purchase BTC at market price and can later presumably sell that GBTC which should have followed BTC price. The trading company doesn't necessarily purchase or sell BTC at the precise moment someone buys or sells GBTC, but in order for the company not to get in a lot of trouble, they should see that they soon hold actual bitcoins or other instruments based on bitcoin as much as GBTC:s are worth on the market. Again too much depending on trust for my taste. I'll hodl my own coins.
The average Joe still goes on believing he bought oil and gold when he buys WTI and GLD. The value of those follows that of actual oil and gold, so the rest is semantics.
Regarding that downvote, your paranoia is misplaced. It wasn't me. Even though you are just some random person from the internet, accusations hurt.

I think this could be one of those times when people seriously underestimate the ramifications of events in time.

I'm pretty used to people laughing at me and then and after a few years realizing that I was right. It gets boring and you start to enjoy the fact that those people never benefit from these things you suggest. Kind of like watching a movie where the lead character is written to be so stupid that instead of rooting for him/her you wish some very unpleasant things to happen to the character.
