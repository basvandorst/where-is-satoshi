You buy about 5 Bitcoins and do absolutely nothing with them. Then you move from pipe dream to pipe dream. Maybe Iran will adopt Bitcoin, maybe it will be big in online gambling, maybe it will somehow play a role in digital distribution. After about 32 times you stop paying attention but hold on to your Bitcoins because...well maybe someday right?

It's really unlikely this will be successful so I don't know why you're in a huff about it being physical. You're promising advertisers 2000 readers (and selling a 1000 dollar advertisement) when I would be amazed if you could keep up 100 paying subscribers. At the moment the more modest something relating to Bitcoin is the more realistic it is as well.

All of the very small sum he receives will be because he is being singled out instead of the 10000 other freeware developers.

"Can Digital Currency Create New Music Revenue Stream?" I know the answer to this one! It's nope.

First off you will need to buy about 29 more 6850's and a small UHaul truck. Quit your job and load your whole set up back there with a 3G connection, a cooler and a pillow (mining will keep you warm enough). Start traveling to casual family campground after campground. You'll be able to get free electricity there and use some of profit for gas food and accommodation for when you get kicked out. From there on out it's just a waiting game brother. Once Bitcoin is accepted by a sovereign nation you'll be an instant billionaire and world power.

A 1000 members is barely a drop in the ocean. So it has like .000001 accounts compared to actual gamers? How is that "quickly" becoming the Western Union of virtual item transactions? Listen true believers...even backing the worlds virtual hats is too wildly ambitious for you to expect. That is down quite a way from revolutionizing currency isn't it?

"Encourage them to use their Bitcoins to pay debts to friends" Poor kid.

Wonder how many thousands that guy will lose.

Yeah the currency people want and use.

I am also a bitcoin analyst and I think there was a bubble.

This is an amazing example of Bitcoin business!

It clearly says r/Bitcoin so it's talking about this tiny subreddit. Really Bitcointalk just has become more intolerant since the latest crash. If you are anything but a true believer...

I mean the fact they are dusty, production is staggeringly inefficient, have to be shipped across the country instead of bought at a local store and fill no gap or need in the market.
