You mean like when one of the coins based on the genesis block breaks 10k?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:19
Iota has the potential to be a great coin tho...

What I find even more fascinating than your terribly warpped understanding of bitcoin is the fact that you spend time in the bitcoin subreddit spreading lies and hostility. Are you angry that you missed the bitcoin rocket, or have your shorts finally dried up your account?

Jesus get a grip. It's just an 8% dip.

Easiest way: take all of your money and light it on fire

Roughly 15 dollars to 1000 dollars. Just look at a price graph, you don't need a citation to prove that.

Only a fool would use bitcoin in its current state when there are alternatives that are much efficient. I think it's like a 15-30 fee just to make sure your transaction confirms in 2 hours, which is absolutely insane. 
I'm not even shilling, I'm just infuriated that my bitcoin is basically stuck in my wallet because I refuse to pay these retarded fees. If the devs don't sort this out they're going to get dethroned sooner than they think.

Yeah, looks like coinbase is messing with the price. No way it "accidentally" skyrocketed bcash like that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:06
Lmao have you looked at a graph of bitcoin's price lately?

Make it less obvious you're a 60 yo man who can hardly figure out how to log into his reddit account
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:24:08
lol you think an exchange as big as bittrex would steal your decimal of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:08:20
You sound defensive
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:34:39
If you've made millions on bitcoin you're an idiot for not moving some of that into other investments. 
Unless of course you genuinely believe in a decentralized currency, then I doubt you'd be too bothered by a crash since crypto means something more to you than making a profit.

Do you consider stocks a ponzi scheme too? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:32:27
Because he isn't aware that there are people/organizations interested in bitcoin besides your average small time investor.

Get money
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:43:07
Well it's certainly not a 528
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:25:58
You sound defensive
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:41:22
So you like volume, but don't believe in technicals? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:27:28
I'm sure a correction will happen after we crack 25k
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:32:02
10/10 shit post
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:41:00
What about IOTA?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:05:21
But it's Bcash, not bitcoin. Therefore it is not bitcoin. Pretty straightforward concept here guys. 
Bcash is just trying to piggyback on bitcoin's branding.

Premature maybe, but don't underestimate the power of memes in this market. Just look what they accomplished in the past presidential election.
