Ok cool i signed up
@_date: 2019-11-29 16:46:44
It can be done but they make commission off you signing up with them. You can do it yourself, with the volatility it has its easy to do. Just set limit orders and execute them. I use [R-H]( to do my trades and been consistently making $15 a day on average. And im just going to keep scaling from there. Made $50 so far this morning so it can be done for people who have bigger money to play with
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:52:02

@_date: 2019-11-07 17:19:28

@_date: 2019-11-18 20:06:40

@_date: 2019-11-20 04:43:07
I Just finished the Training on this for the upcoming tax year (i’m a certified tax practitioner with the IRS) most of these responses are incorrect please speak with your tax preparer and make sure they fully have training on the crypto currency reporting.  There is a few things your prepare should ask you to properly answer this. I.e how much did you purchase? Did you use an exchange? Etc etc bottom line if you check that box understand that they will he watching you from here on out. If you didnt receive that notice proceed with caution. The things they told us in that training was alarming. I have to inform all my clients in the up coming weeks of the shit storms i gotta protect them from. Bottom line talk to your preparer and forget most of these comments from those who are practitioners.
@_date: 2019-11-20 19:01:27
U gonna read all 1.96 million responses?
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:16:52
Nope dont wait its going back down soon
@_date: 2019-11-07 23:51:42
Well yea But i mean is mcdonalds or pizza really a drug?....i guess it depends on who u ask
@_date: 2019-11-29 06:20:24
If you have to ask if its a scam then its probably a scam
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:41:14
$2200 rent
&amp;1500 in other expenses on minimum
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:57:01
I would go but I work those days ��
@_date: 2019-11-29 05:57:27
Yea just one thing.......EVERYTHING!
@_date: 2019-11-07 22:40:19
 Soooooo you didnt learn from the story of the guy who ordered pizza with his bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:26:11
Just for the record the fee was not posted on the ATM or on the coinATM
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:31:00
Nope if it wouldve i wouldve walked away
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:01:08
No just a QR code of the transaction
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:23:08
No i see why people use it.
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:24:15
Ah i see you’re a man of culture as well
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:47:41
Well then why doesnt someone who isnt a scammer make a better product and put them out of business instead? Probably should tell the masses and people who are new to the space to stay away from the bitcoin unless they would like to be associated with illegal activity and be scammed huh.
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:02:20
Well not quite everyone is. About 30% of the community seem to the be. The rest are just assholes who think they are superior because they know about crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:10:08
Yea put in $40 and get back $26. Never again
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:14:15
That makes sense but dang
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:12:57
Seriously its? Its the blockchain app on iphone. Which should I use?
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:58:54
Idk thats why I asked if that is normal in the bitcoin community. Lol If so no wonder why people dont do it.
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:13:52
I just sold do I sell?
@_date: 2019-10-16 22:41:45
Where did you get it from? Im trying to get one since last learning about it
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:08:47
No wonder why its not adopted by the masses. They cant afford it
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:40:25
It does cash and other services to soooooo yea.
@_date: 2019-10-31 22:42:29
Nope not a wallet
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:39:24
How bout No
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:17:26
I probably shouldve done it as a video.
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:12:35
Who in their right mind seeks out to get scammed? Lol
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:40:44
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:38:06
They did not post the transaction fees on the atm, i dont use bitconnect 2.0, (not my wallet not my coin) i have my wallet back up phrase, and the BBB is a fuckin joke so i wouldnt waste my time. So before you go making wild accusations about what somebody does or dont know you u should probably ask. Its not the technology that doesnt cause mass adoption its people like you that the masses dont want to deal with.
@_date: 2019-10-02 03:41:21
Now all you need is a bit atm there. Let me know if you guys need one my company is always looking for new locations to get them more foot traffic.
@_date: 2019-10-16 22:04:25
You gotta have a penny in the bank account first im currently -$5,837 soooooo yea
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:34:04
Fuuuuuuuccccccccckkkkk ������������
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:07:45
Yea stick to cash ��
@_date: 2019-10-17 05:46:54
Haha i wish I was only $5,837 in debt. Try multiplying that by 10 and we’ll be a little more close. Thats just for that checking account. But thanks hopefully it will plan out i mean its just fiat currency anyway right lol
@_date: 2019-08-22 06:30:06
Im currently looking into do this as well and scaling once my machine turns a profit. Do a lot of research first you’ll find good tips and tricks and alternatives to circumvent many cost. Im in the USA so I dont know the legalities of where you are. But our AML and KYC policy are fairly simple and if you get the right supplier and machine they’ll handle most of that for you. Just gotta find a good location really and make sure your exchange setup is good. Ive been trying to find some videos on how to get in the Bit atm business but have been unsuccessful. I want to make it more accessible for people as well because the fees here are at least 30% so my plan was to charge way less and turn that profit back into more atms at more locations as well.
@_date: 2019-10-16 21:10:54
I bought at $12,000 its now below $8,000 at this point idgaf no more and cant buy more cuz im broke
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:39:47
Im thinking the same as well guess depends on what you plan on doing
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:38:15
Im not gonna be happy until its back over $9300 so i break even
@_date: 2019-10-17 05:47:26
More like if the lenders believed in me having the ability to pay them back ������
@_date: 2019-10-19 06:20:40
Yeeeeeeaaaaaa but still doesnt answer the question
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:41:47
Well....yea thats why everyone riding scooters ��
@_date: 2019-10-02 22:29:47
Just download the coinatm radar app. I use it all the time and you can always call the locations where they are at to verify they are working before wasting a trip
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:43:25
You would think that would be the logical solution. I feel like more people would do it if it was that accessible.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:02:23
What are the prices
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:12:05
It was lammasu atm
@_date: 2019-08-19 12:43:24
Why not both
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:27:21
Masses the masses
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:10:28
Final fucking ly! Now i can sell
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:32:42
This!!!!! ��������������������
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:20:41
Which state have you found to be less strict
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:08:16
Thats one way of putting but if he already owns this store and atm in the store hes not really risking much since he has no cash logistics just ties the profits into his normal cash deposits, doesnt need to pay for space since he already owns it and would pay on it whether its there or not and not have to worry about banks turning him away because he is a brick and mortar owner. In that case he just basically made $14 from nothing. Hope he doesnt expect more users with those fees.
@_date: 2019-08-12 03:38:09
@_date: 2019-10-02 18:21:56
It depends on the atm/owner operator because ive gone to several different atms some will ask some wont. The KYC Rules and regulations vary from state to state and municipalities.
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:53:51
Theres a bitcoin hero Atm that I go to in culver city mall that doesnt ask. I upload about $100-$400 there each time. But the one in the mall by my house ask for phone number, then there is one in a liquor store that doesnt ask and another one In a thrift shop by my house, also i used one in vegas that didnt ask, but there is also one a gas station near my house that ask. So it varies all these were all different brands and models. So the KYC Complaince varies i know because im looking into getting an atm for myself
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:24:20
Boy this fuckin video took me out!!!! What a meat head ������
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:14:15
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:16:26

@_date: 2019-12-25 21:56:01

@_date: 2019-12-17 13:42:29
Pure ATM with no KYC &amp; if it is ill use a disposable phone number from an app
@_date: 2019-12-01 05:14:56
Do you want bitcoin or are you just trying to make a profit from trading
@_date: 2019-12-25 19:41:49

@_date: 2019-12-13 22:03:33
Well I just wasted $10 smh
@_date: 2019-12-09 18:13:05
I personally like coinstats app and tab trader. But blockfolio is good to i just dont like the interface to much
@_date: 2019-12-29 06:28:33
I just go to the atm
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:14:41
Funny how the moment I posted this I get banned from r/btc which is the $100 coin of what they were offering smh.
@_date: 2019-12-13 20:30:50
They require KYC?
@_date: 2019-12-27 00:05:43
@_date: 2019-12-13 03:57:41
Noice!!! Im in L.A. may need to swing by and get some stuff ��
@_date: 2019-12-13 03:52:57
Where is the shop?
@_date: 2019-12-13 03:54:43
Nice! Are you planning accepting bitcoin if you don’t already?
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:43:30
Just set a gambling budget, throw the money there and walk away, come back at 2025 see what happened. Easy squeezey
@_date: 2019-12-16 08:40:02
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:29:48
Better to use a Mental stop losses, they are better because marker makers are trained to take out stop losses on traders accounts. So soon as you place that limit loss, they gonna drag the price down to it, cash you out and shoot it right back up.
@_date: 2019-12-13 18:14:34
Nice try IRS
@_date: 2019-12-21 07:13:14
Its the government extraordinarily shit is how they do everything
@_date: 2019-12-03 01:38:07
Apparently they are giving out $100 in Bitcoin cash to one random winner
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:59:41
What store is it ill buy just for the fact you take crypto alone
@_date: 2019-12-14 04:23:44
Thanks for the tip. I’ll look into this, not quite sure what that means but I’ll figured it out. Ive seen people post about electrum and wasabi but havent looked into what they were or their role in the bitcoin community. Still learning this stuff. Any links or ideas on tutorials on how to create a node.
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:36:49
I mean he owns the Dallas Mavericks....out of all the teams you could pick he clearly isnt always mentally stable about certain subjects this being one of them.
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:31:43
Ok boomer
@_date: 2019-12-27 05:46:02
Sounds like idiots who just dont know what they are doing. And Well he said temporary so it sounds like exactly what he needs to me. All the ones you mentioned most people recommended for long term use/storage
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:38:21
Yea sell em to me
@_date: 2019-12-01 05:24:26
If you arent trading then dont use robinhood. Buy yourself a hard wallet and continuously load Bitcoin on there. I do both i have [Robinhood ]( and a hard wallet they both have different purposes.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:33:12
Well if you use those in your strategy and it isnt. I dont use those because market makers play off them
@_date: 2019-12-13 18:12:38
I did the black friday special and got 2 keepkeys for $5 each but i want to get a trezor wallet next
@_date: 2019-12-27 00:09:20

@_date: 2019-12-23 05:51:21
Theres literally one in like every L.A. gas station
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:26:10
Thanks for the link. I seen that this company was just incorporated this past February as well. ������
@_date: 2019-12-26 23:58:37

@_date: 2019-12-13 18:06:10
Yea easy stop using those apps that require that because you dont need to. Exchanges are worthless
@_date: 2019-12-21 05:34:38
Nice! Im ordering one of those ATM’s myself.
@_date: 2019-09-08 16:58:52

@_date: 2019-09-09 04:21:19
They save the average is 30k a month. Some as high as 100k others as low as 10k. Location is key though
@_date: 2019-09-09 07:23:34
Please please please for the love of god and everything holy, for humanity’s sake, please make a youtube video with a step by step tutorial on how you did this. Then tag me in it or message me the link. I BEG OF YOU!!!!! ����
@_date: 2019-09-09 19:59:13
@_date: 2019-09-26 06:25:41
Nice!!  just curious would your shop be interested in having a bitcoin ATM there? My company is looking for locations to put the ones we have in our inventory to help bring crypto currency accessibility to more people. We provide and maintain everything needed for the atm at no cost to your business and it takes up very little space.
@_date: 2019-09-22 04:58:44
I own several
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:24:58
Where is it at? Ill put one out there for less.
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:26:39
Im in L.A. i can definitely bring them some competition. Is it in a mall?
