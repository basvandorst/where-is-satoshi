Jeff from Statefarm here, that's a no-can-do!

John from coinbase here, it's totally legit!

I've been trying to find if it comes from a picture, was looking at famous paintings :-)
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:25:21
the problem with that (so far) is that everything else is hex, and not base58
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:37:16
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:32:20
Not lying so far:
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:50:03
Based on some new evidence, at least some requires dissecting the image with software
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:18:28


@_date: 2018-10-07 00:32:31
just if R != G or B set 1, else 0
@_date: 2018-10-04 14:40:15
did anyone else extract a 2800 bit (700 hex) string from the image? Not sure what to do with it now...
@_date: 2018-10-04 14:54:51
comes from row 310 on the image, very cheeky
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:52:28
jpg is above in thread
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:03:33
Yeah several of us have
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:38:09
If anyone wants help or wants to offer help, feel free to ping me. I'm trying to maximize my expected value by helping as much as possible :-)
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:58:57
Go all the way to the bottom. Also makes sense why the logo and footer exif data doesn't match.
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:41:05
The single L and K are weird, everything else is valid hex
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:30:49
couldn't repro from gimp either
@_date: 2018-10-02 21:17:56
the lines look like chopped up bits of an elliptic curve
@_date: 2018-10-07 14:27:47
I didnt, I looked through the transactions
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:09:09

@_date: 2018-10-07 17:33:27
you need to only look at the least significant bit of the R channel.
@_date: 2018-10-02 21:33:44
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:32:21
given the R and Alpha channel's first 1960 bits, is there a logical operator you can apply to the two to get the first 24 bits to match 1F 8B 08
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:06:38
following the now public knowledge of extracting the QR/line from the image, I just opened the image in python with opencv, grabbed line 310, binary encoded (values were either near 0 or near 130)
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:36:17
310 exhibits 2 patterns, alpha channel can be read, then convert to utf8 to produce a base64 encoded openssl encrypted string. Also can read 310's red channel and if its even, set 1, or odd, set 0 (or maybe the reverse) to get a second string of data. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:07:21
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:52:41
One sec, I'll record a gif of how to do it in gimp
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:34:55
if red%0==0 set 1, else 0 (or potentially the opposite)
@_date: 2018-10-08 01:13:51
given that most of the public has figured out the 2 openssl strings, does anyone have any insight into decrypting them? Looks like they have different salts which is weird, though I don't see any interesting patterns to the two salts (e.g. xoring the channels yielded the strings, but xoring the salts yields nothing). The solution to 0.1 is floating around as well, but basically it boils down to the date and the number 310, all permutations of which don't seem to help decrypt the strings. Feel free to reach on via DM. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:20:29
yeah im stuck here too
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:27:28
noticed that while trying to track back through wallet addresses, probably a mistake
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:48:16
If it's real, i hope it takes months or years to solve. Needs to be worth it :-)
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:19:54
These are all discovered in greater detail, look at the rest of the comments here
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:24:23
you can track the transactions back to polo and mount gox wallets
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:00:12
a quick way to view with photoshop, equivalent on any other editor: just isolate the transparency
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:36:26
yeah i would expect what some others have suggested, it may be possible to find 0.31, 0.2, and 0.1 independently (and indeed, we have at least 3 separate sets of symbols already found, with no way to link them), but it seems likely that 310 requires all of this info.

the gzip file is encoded in the R channel of line 310. The last 840/2800 bits will match the last 840 of the alpha channel data, but the first 1960 you can derive an encoding using the R channel and the Alpha channel data (its easy, the first 3 bytes of output should be 1F 8B 08, the magic number for gzip). 
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:50:31
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:35:53
I didn't, I looked on the alpha channel where that QR code lived (extracted in the jpg on imgur), there's a line of characters on the 310'th row which I read using opencv, then converted it to a sequence of 2800 1 and 0 by just masking "&lt;50" since the digits were all around 0 or around 130
@_date: 2018-10-06 19:23:07
Did you find the hidden image with pixel manipulation or just following the image structure? 
@_date: 2019-02-14 21:58:37
lmao you've got issues
@_date: 2019-02-14 22:10:39
I think your anger might be misdirected. Start with PE/HF shops first, then when you're done with that come back with your residual anger for banks.
