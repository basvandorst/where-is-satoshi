I've had this idea since I first heard of bitcoin and I'm glad to see someone else has taken the next step with it.
We can't expect every locale to have perfect cell reception or a wifi signal for our phones so the next best thing is to allow the hardware wallet (phone, tablet, dedicated, etc.) to sign raw transactions then pass them over to the merchant to submit to the blockchain.
The merchant can't tamper with them after they're signed and can tell right away if it's valid because they will likely have a connection of sorts (broadband/dial-up) to verify the account has the funds, and whether the transaction is valid.
This would be beneficial to most b&amp;m stores but I can see it being useful at rural gas stations where it's unlikely there are any cell towers.

Where are you guys when the community is rallying together, dicks in hand at whatever new Andreas interview or talk is posted? Everytime I mention that he has no real skills to contribute to bitcoin,  has made no actual contributions thus far, and he's just a glorified sys admin I get a flurry of people calling me a troll.

Because this new breed of retarded developers want Javascript to be a one language solution to everything. JS just wasn't built for anything but basic scripting in mind.
Their inability to learn a real language or a new one to adapt to another project is what draws them to something baby-tier like JS. The JS push is probably the worst thing to happen to the web. Now we have websites that use garbage like Angular that break a website for anyone who disables JS.
Node is the only passable development so far and it's still in its infancy.

I'm interested in the data exchange over SMS. What is being encrypted exactly? Why not remove trust (and encryption) by just sending a raw transaction over SMS?

I assume the company will already be operating an application server which receives the inbound SMS from users and completes transactions on their behalf.

Whether it is a one-man operation is irrelevant. This idea is out, and a brilliant one at that. Someone will fill the void in the market regardless of one companies ability to find success.

Thanks, brushing over those Bladox links looks like a goldmine. There is definitely a lot to work through, I don't anticipate sleeping anytime soon :-)
One thing the gentlemen in the video said was they would be doing this outside of the rules of carriers, and device manufacturers. If the carrier will block SIM messages from being sent between standard users (for security purposes I assume), wouldn't that mean they could also stop the company offering these devices/services or deny them to begin with?
It seems like they would have to be working with carriers to sort this out otherwise.

I'm going to have to disagree. Just based on the linked conversation thread, Andreas comes off as incredibly snotty while Preston managed to keep things cordial. He may have strong views but scrolling through his twitter feed hasn't brought up anything that would lead one to believe he is unprofessional as d4d5c4e5 (probably Andreas) said below.
Andreas hasn't actually formulated an argument and instead resorted to ad-hominem. That's weakness on his part, and says more about how he's at a point where bitcoin isn't headed towards what he has been promising for years (snake oilish) and he's stuck defending stale statements he made about its future uses.
**Edit:** I'm anticipating downvotes from Andreas' possy but I'd like to have someone actually point out why they think Andreas is in the right here if possible.
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:44:49
Yes because ~5 years is enough time to determine whether something is unstoppable. There could be an unknown bug that causes a fork, which the developers are unable to solve in a fast enough time, thus eliminating confidence in bitcoin.

Ah another armchair psycho-analyst reading too far into nothing.
Why must Bill Gates, or Musks remarks be influenced by government? I'm fairly certain Gates does have issues with the anonymity aspect as he doesn't prioritize consumer privacy. I also recall him having issues with the one-way nature of transactions.
In the case of Musk, that man is far too busy as is to even give a shit about bitcoin. He's making actual strides towards a prosperous future for the human race.
Bitcoiners need to come to terms with the fact that the majority of people don't have or don't care about the issues bitcoin is trying to solve. Thus waiting around and jumping at every mention of it does nothing to further progress.

Is there a difference between messages targeting the SIM and standard messages sent to the phone?
I was under the impression the SIM card had full access to the SMS available on the phone. Is this not the case? However, payment requests I definitely did not consider that. That allows for a much more elegant solution than what I had in mind. Namely the exchange of addresses can get tricky on older phones.
This is the first I'm hearing so I'm understandably excited to learn more. I had heard of the SIM application toolkit in the past, but never considered the capabilities. Now I'm looking to absorb more, any useful links I should read up on?

You think because you make a few balogna sandwiches for homeless people you're suddenly the largest provider for them?
Let me tell you something about homeless people, I've hired a few because I felt charitable. I wanted to give them a chance to get their lives back on track. All of them slacked off despite me being very leniant, more so than I would be with my other employees. All of them asked for loans and advances on their checks, despite me telling them thats not possible. All of them never showed up when they said they would. When they did they reeked of cigarettes and booze. They barely did the simple job I hired them for, and still had the nerve to ask for more.
At the end of the day I fired all of them happily. Fuck homeless people, this is one of the greatest countries that has ever existed. Being homeless is a choice, there are so many people actually helping them (unlike you) that they could easily get their life back together if they tried. But its so much easier to be a pathetic drifter feeding off the good graces of others.
As far as I'm concerned, when you check out of society you no longer deserve societies help. Homeless people are a non-priority and we should let them die off.

Yes, and you're an idiot because you missed a fundemental concept of bitcoin.
Bitcoin is fungible, the current 8 decimal spaces what was initially deemed appropriate by satoshi. Because .00000001 BTC is worth far less than a penny, nobody is worried about how many units there are.
The developers could easily add 100 more decimal places if it were necessary, which again, at the moment it's not.

I brought this up to Gavin but never got a response. The best implementation I thought of was adding it to the [URI scheme](
If you could append "&amp;txfee=123" to a payment URI then wallet developers would be able to inform the user that the merchant has chosen to pay a larger transaction fee which would be deducted from the total being sent rather than added to the total.
The merchant could then choose to pay a higher transaction fee (probably pennies) to ensure they get a confirmation faster. This would make sense with larger purchases &gt;$100, or smaller ones in the service industry where customers come and go too fast to wait on confirmations.

Right, because me pointing out how useless you and your buttbuddy Andreas are to bitcoin is automatically trolling. I'm not looking to get a response, I actually think you and your boy are worthless and bitcoin would be the same without either of you.
Are you supposed to be someone important? From what I can tell you're just a reddit karmawhore. Defaulting to "this guy must be trolling" because he doesn't believe what I do is a typical low-test, beta response. Go get laid man, and try women for a change.

Amir is a thief and an idiot.
He open sourced bitcoinity's backend (for no reason) without telling anyone at bitcoinity which resulted in someone finding a vulnerability and stealing everything. He lost a lot of peoples money and there are still plenty who believe he was the thief.
AFAIK he's never even commented on his actions so that makes things even more suspicious.

His tactic is to appeal to the anarchist ideals of people, explain all the things that bitcoin *can* be and probably never will.

Most people in this thread are Circle shills. It's funny how many upvotes the submission got despite all the "top" comments being pro-Circle.
Circle is fucking shady and I wouldn't trust them with a satoshi. Fuck Circle.

Who cares? Not like he'll ever be close enough with a woman to use it. Why do you think he supports SJW/feminist causes? Because that's what all beta permavirgins do. I'm sure that any option looks good when you've been alive as long has he has and never actually fucked a girl.

Gavin would actually be qualified to testify though. Him writing a letter to say Andreas is qualified would be lying.

I'm calling you a shill for shilling, this has nothing to do with your beliefs.

Except I'm at work getting paid ~$90k/yr to write this. There's literally nothing you could do/say that would phase me. Keep trying though, you might make something of yourself one day. Or maybe hold on to those 2 or 3 bitcoin and keep waiting for them to make you rich.

To expand the company also mines your personal data and sells/hands it over to advertisers and government agencies.

You will probably never make ROI buying miners.
Your best bet is to buy asic chips in bulk (or design your own and order from a Chinese fab) then design and roll your own circuit boards.
That is the most profitable method and what most of the large mining operations are doing.

he wrote a book on a subject he was still not 100% versed in (his words). That's like me teaching you how to speak chinese (I don't know how to speak chinese btw).


What exactly does this entail and explain to me how its relevant to bitcoin. Further, he doesn't even work at blockchain anymore, no doubt because they realized he just wasn't a useful asset.
Lastly the fuck does cock size have to do with this? This isn't a dick measuring contest, he has contributed nothing to bitcoin and possesses a barely passable knowledge of it. When compared to Gavin or Greg, he's nothing. 
This may upset you but people in this space who aren't actively developing new technologies around bitcoin are useless. We don't need people spending bitcoin right now, we don't need "investors" right now, we don't even need businesses to accept btc now. None of that matters until the technology is mature enough to scale infinitely. Considering bitcoin anything more than an experiment at this stage is something to be expected from idiots like yourself.
Why don't you just get back to sucking Andreas cock, you're as useless to bitcoin as he is.

Why werent you up front that your "insurance" policy was provided by a company wholly funded by xapo?
It's a bit suspicious that you wouldnt just come out and say it but instead phrase it as "your bitcoin are insured".
Write me off as a troll but the point still stands.

Not surprising, Andreas is a lowly network admin. He has little to no qualifications and his only experience with bitcoin is being involved in the ecosystem.
He's not a computer scientist, a programmer, or even a developer.

Because they come to places like r/bitcoin and see how fucking stupid all the people involved with bitcoin are.
Bitcoin is a great concept but the community around it is mostly shit. Almost exactly like cannabis vs cannabis culture.

He hasn't even acknowledged that tip. Considering that changetip can tip anyone on twitter, since their launch everyone "now accepts" bitcoin tips.
God this is stupid, this subreddit will upvote anything. This is an advertisement for changetip, nothing else.
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:12:09
No he wouldn't. I mentioned it in another comment, but Andreas has zero qualifications. He's not a computer scientist, programmer, or developer. He's contributed zero bits of code to the bitcoin project and according to his own words he barely understood it (while trying to write a book about it no less!).
This guy is a hack, it's not surprising he was blocked. His idealistic/anarchist beliefs are great, but there's no room for that in the courtroom. Not to mention he has nothing to do with this case and would not benefit the defense in any way.
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:29:58
You don't seem the least bit qualified to be running this unless it's right into the ground.

That was exactly what he was thinking. But he lacked the foresight to understand that not everything needs to be open sourced, especially when we're talking about a financial product managing other peoples money.


Last I heard he was hiding out in Spain. That is hardly a modest lifestyle and more like avoiding any potential legal issues that would arise. He disappeared right about the time pirate40 got busted, he must have thought it would only be a matter of time before he was under investigation.
