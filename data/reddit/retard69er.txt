Behind the wheel? What?
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:02:11
Dwindling? Like every person I know talks about crypto on a daily basis.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:04:14
But they are not Bitcoin which OP is talking about...
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:16:39
Your heading for each section are wayyyy too long and make the site look very ammeturish. Plus a lot of that info can be found in many many other places
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:06:10
You missed one important one: HODLING
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:56:31
This absolute shit. Don't even bother...
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:19:32
How much were you trying to send? 20 cents? Get a job.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:21:47
Yeah... Because people would rather pay $100 in Tx fees than lose thousands holding
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:02:47
Success story? Have you seen the market?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:42:25
If you're in Australia use coinjar. They are good IMO
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:07:22
Not always. Apparently nxt is forking in Jan and you get 0.5 of new coin for ever nxt you own.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:29:48
try transferring from a wallet to an exchange during a massive sell off and let me know how you go.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:55:41
grow up cry-baby snowflake.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:35:12
Or you could sell and buy more for a cheaper price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:21:07
It's just like buying physical gold and paying for international shipping!
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:08:38
My apologies dude. Had no idea. Good luck with that! 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:13:38
HODL! 
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:00:30
Why not? Do profits depend on how grown up you are?? God I hate people like you. Get off your high horse.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:22:59
Dude don't even worry. It's not like you're gonna "miss" the volatility... It's crypto...
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:56:38
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:14:55
Yeah I get you. I may be paying a little extra, but I like the options they give. Still a good company IMO.
Plus! I thought there is a limit on coinbase for maximum daily deposit ($500 if I remember correct?) 
I can add a few thousand a day with coinjar.
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:11:33
Because basically nobody knows about Litecoin unless they're already into crypto. All the general public are really aware of is Bitcoin (BTC) and to a lesser extent, Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:20:42
I use coinjar but only to purchase/sell coins using fiat. The second I receive my coin i transfer it to cold storage.
Never had any issues with coinjar myself. They have good customer support too!
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:29:17
No issues for me. Just traded my BCH for BTC and withdrew no problem.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:43:39
Dollar cost averaging is good in some cases, but not all. For example. If you put 4k into Bitcoin one month ago, you would be doing MUCH better than if you say put in 1k a week.
The reason so many people advocate dollar cost averaging is because it is the only option they have ie. Put some In Each pay check
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:21:44
Just enough to make some profit, so anywhere under $4040 I'm happy with.
If it goes below 3900 I'm cheering!
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:25:25
Nice one

Guys! Just follow what this man says and we will all be half way to millionaire!
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:15:37
Let me guess... You bought in at $4300+?
If so, that means you've only been using bitcoins for a few days... I think it's a bit too early for you to be making calls like this....
Still up over 75% this month...
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:41:43
I'm sure it will drop a bit, but by how much? Who knows. From what I've gathered, if you're in for the long run, best time to buy is now.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:28:04
That's really sad...
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:59:45
DIP DIP DIP DIP
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:46:21
I agree man. If you're in for the long haul, a few hundred dollars won't really matter.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:30:27
Thanks guys. Somehow your comments make me feel a little bit better. I'm just glad I didn't lose more and have learnt my lesson! 
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:45:53
I agree. Some of the topics talked about on bitcointalk are mind-blowing my dumb...
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:43:14
In the long run, a couple hundred dollars won't make a big difference. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:15:09
This literally made me lol. What a fucking idiot!
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:13:47
Because if you're in for the long run a few hundred dollars won't make a difference
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:38:50
Pump money?
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:46:36
Ummmm I used bitaddress.org and created a paper wallet. Is this what you mean or.... I don't really understand your question. Why is it making you lose sleep??
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:09:47
No. For example; 10% of $10 is 1 dollar.
10% of 1000 is $100.
1 dollar isn't much to even worth thinkin about, where $100 you might. (Most people)
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:30:33
Did u buy a full coin or a part?
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:29:22
If this is legit. Cya at the moon guys! GG
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:27:37
So good!!
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:13:10
Nah I do understand. That's the thing... I used to feel the exact same way you did. but I have learnt the hard way that it's usually more profitable AND LESS STRESSFUL to just hold. 
May I ask how much you have invested? I don't mean dollar amount or anything.... Just a rough amount... Eg. Over 10k, over 1k, under 1k, under 100
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:07:16
if you take all fiat currently and covert it to BTC each coin will be something like 5.8 mil each
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:40:52
What if it doesn't dip? If you're in for the long run, just buy now.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:52:33
Uhh maybe price rose??
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:29:02
Literally me...
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:39:33
What's it got to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:36:27
If you remove the last sentence it makes a bit of sense. I don't know what this Bitcoin Cash shit is about.
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:56:46
well segwit locks in wednesday which should be interesting.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:01:07
I get newsletter from a place called coinsheet. The guy who writes it is usually pretty spot on with his analysis, but last night he was saying for everybody to take their profits as it was almost certain to drop back to at least 3300 (this was when it was nearing 3500). But wow was he wrong... 
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:54:50
why do you assume OP knows nothing?
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:04:58
Cos people are making thousands-millions of dollars?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:51:28
This! I have learnt two lessons now, each costing me hundreds.... 
1. NEVER TRADE SHITCOINS!
2. NEVER SELL BITCOIN
I have been badly burnt twice by trying to do either of these.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:06:34
This is literally me, except I'm Australian.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:49:58
Simply for pointing out BTC is now more profitable to mine than BCH... Exactly what they've been saying about us for the last few weeks... 
Much hypocrite! Such censorship! Wow!
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:04:33
Sell price is also high on coinjar. Usually $200 more.
Also as far as I'm aware, you cannot withdraw straight back into your bank account like how you can with coinjar. Or am I incorrect?
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:58:10
I'm in Aus and I use coinjar.com which has its head office in Melbourne.
Very easy interface to use. All you need to do is provide ID and proof of address then you can start depositing AUD into your account which you can the convert to BTC for a 1% fee. At any time you can convert your BTC back into AUD and withdraw it straight back into your linked bank account. They also offer an eftpos card which you can use at any eftpos machine which will automatically convert your BTC to fiat for the transaction.
I've heard it is quite secure (make sure you use F2A), but I stI'll use cold storage after purchasing just to be sure.
Very fast response for customer support too. Always been within a few hours for me.
I recommend them.
Edit: Be aware you will not own your private keys unless you transfer your BTC to a key you have total control over, but this is the same as most online wallets unfortunately!
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:16:45
Try coinjar. I use them in Aus and apparently they just opened shop in uk too
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:31:30
Yeah they didn't delete it at least...
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:10:27
Yup. Definitely dead.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:19:39
If you are referring to BCH just shut the fuck up right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:54:58
i honeslty don't know how people even get it in their heads that bitcoin is a ponzi/pyramid scheme. Do they honeslty just chuck those words out their because they don't know what else to say? Like a defence mechanism? I will always ask them why they believe that and nobody can answer... Fucking drives me insane.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:18:35
Lol when it at 800+ I jumped on r/BTC to warn the guys there to take the profits before they get burnt and guess what? They flamed me into oblivion (was expected), but look at them now lololol 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:02:37
Isn't that a rank is CS:GO?
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:56:17
I fucking sold like 2 mins before the big jump up last night... Then had to buy back In Straight away -$500.  
NEVEr SELL
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:49:10
You realise this is from April 
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:59:05
The second i sold i knew i had made a massive mistake... I guess at least i got back in before i had lost too much :P
What sucks is the "Oh, im only down 5-10%... thats not TOOO bad..., then you realise its like fucking hundred and hundred of dollars to replace it.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:54:09
I doubt he is going into this blindly... He has obviously chosen Bitcoin for a reason. (Massive gains probably?)
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:19:59
Not sure if many will see this and assume it is Bitcoin related... Especially if the person reading isn't in the Bitcoin scene.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:40:27
lol well if he panick sells then that's his own fault. Jus sayin, if he bought when I posted the original comment he'd be up 7% already.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:32:52
I am proud of myself! 1st time I've been able to resist a panick sell! Go me! Hodl 4 lyf
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:59:23
Someone please put this on r/BTC for me... I would but I'm banned.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:45:13
dude. i bought in last week. up 36% so far...
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:59:44
It's nowhere near as bad.... Trust me
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:40:03
Is this real? BCH says 288 billion now too!
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:02:44

@_date: 2017-08-27 10:46:00
Do not ask someone to go all in on anything while its at an ATH. Good chance they'll get burned in the short term, causing them to panick sell and blame you for their losses. 
I will tell friends to look into it and tell them some of the benefits, but never to actually put money in...

Neckbeard edge-lord award of the year goes to....
Or are you satoshi himself?
Honestly, I would rather have 1 mil than have some "knowledge". GG
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:18:42
Buy Bitcoin before the fork if u want free coins
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:00:10
I think using satoshis is way too low. 89000 satoshis for a cup of coffee? Much too complex. Use bits instead ie: .00000100
This way a cup of coffee would be 8.9 bits or whatever. Much more simple and easy to use.
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:17:31
I agree. I believe that BTC not budging at 4K is a very positive sign!

@_date: 2017-08-16 13:40:31
I was having trouble with bread wallet too. It took about 10 hours for mine to get confirmed, but finally it's done. Just wait it will go through eventually
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:17:52
Can't you just pay more and put whatever the fuck you want on it?
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:20:26
AFAIK coinbase does not accept usdt so u r basically screwed. Also, you wouldn't have any private keys from poloniex cos they don't give them to you.. Soz bra
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:00:57
This... I have always held percentages but yesterday I was like, you know what? Fuck it! I'm buying a full Bitcoin so I did! Mainly for the fact that I don't have to use converters to work out how much I've gained, but rather just look at the Bitcoin price. Also, Feels good to know that i am one of the -0.2% of the entire world population that owns a full coin!
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:17:27
Show the address! I wanna see how many suckers there are out there!
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:20:13
With segwit around the corner, why do people not seem very excited?? This last week has been all FUD, but shouldn't we be celebrating?
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:53:37
Honestly, I don't think it would make much of a difference.
I don't see how "lost" coins are any different than somebody just hodling.
Say we have lost 1mil BTC all up so far. What's the difference between that and say 1000 people in the world holding 1000 BTC each til they are old and gray?
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:41:59
So is it buying or selling?
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:58:39
Fuck never heard this b4...
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:53:20
Thought that might have been the case... Well hopefully won't be too long ��
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:23:07
My 1st week of crypto I was dumb enough to try day trading. Lost roughly $400 in the first week. Held since then and up more than 3x that
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:02:09
Hahaha so true about the Russian thing! Lol I should probably read what he said. This is the inventor of ETH correct?
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:47:50
Just like the OP knows enough to buy and HODL Bitcoin. You don't need to know every in and out of blockchains/bitcoins to take advantage of the profits... 
A person could buy one Bitcoin and know absolutely nothing about it. Another person who buys one Bitcoin  may know every single detail of everything that's has ever happened in bitcoins existence, but it is not going to give them a better profit then the guy who knows nothing. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:44:24
1 gram fat budz 
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:41:25
There was a 6 hour gap between the last 2 blocks lol
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:57:16
It's not likely at all, but there is always potential for any crypto/stock to fall to basically zero. Of course "most" people would have sold way before then.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:38:47
I think doing this just to prove a point isn't a good idea... Just let the other guy win this battle,  but in 10 years you will have won the war when the whole world is buying computer parts with it!
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:00:27
Breadwallet would be safer IMO
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:39:01
That's how they get you (I've heard). They will make themselves seem trust worthy by completing a few successful trades, then when your guard is down that's when they sting ya!
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:13:33
What if in the in the meantime while he is "saving" Bitcoin triples? Just invest now.
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:35:04
Only 0.01? I guess good on ya for getting involved!
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:33:04
Ummm I don't even know what to say to this... Good luck with that man.
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:29:48
I also use coinjar and recommend!
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:01:03
Omg IKR! Every night. Sit down at the computer to play games. "Quickly" checks chart. Sits there for 4 hours watching chart on 5 min candles with stomach in knots. My life lately.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:58:56
Yes. What does it have to do with OP buying Bitcoin? 
So you're telling me that you would rather have knowledge of Bitcoin but not own any, over owning say 100 Bitcoin and not knowing every detail? Good for you buddy! Whatever floats your boat.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:48:39

@_date: 2017-08-10 06:01:48
Dude I am a 20 something in AUS and I just bought a full Bitcoin yesterday. If u got the money to spare. Just fuckin do it. Problem is if your are under 18 it may be more difficult, but not sure.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:33:55
Plus segwit In a couple days
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:17:17
Now your next goal is to own a full coin!
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:06:08
Haha that's easier said than done when people are predicting 10k by end of year :P
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:11:07
Tell me about it
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:29:24
Fuck no. im buying back in + some! just wanted to lock some profits in, just incase my feeling are right and it drops... if it doesnt drop in another 24 hrs im buying back in no matter what.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:44:21
I didn't know Bitcoin was gay.
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:24:31
It's not anonymous if you use a third party to store your coins. Just get them into cold storage STAT! Then who gives a fuck if they know who you are?
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:58:25
Lol. You will soon learn that you should never sell...
Did you even bother to zoom out on that chart of yours and see that this is literally nothing? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:27:51
Haha I've never seen that before! Cheers.

you don't. You earn fiat and buy Bitcoin

@_date: 2017-08-15 10:05:20
Sorry reddit fucked out. I just feel like you need to spend more than a few days in the market before you start selling...
It's only gone down 1%, and that just compared to the price 24 hrs ago. It's still up 20% just this week.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:19:14
Ok that's good
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:54:01
I don't get it. So you feel what exactly? 
Like its a close call? Don't get it...

@_date: 2017-08-10 09:57:23
Hahaha it actually makes my argument less valid if anything...but let's take it out for arguments sake. Would u rather own 100 BTC with no knowledge of how it works, or have SOME knowledge of how Bitcoin works but own no Bitcoin? 
There... Happy now?
Please answer the question.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:26:22

Great podcast featuring one of the biggest names in Bitcoin (Trace Mayer). It isn't super technical, but it is an awesome listen for any beginner in crypto. Listen. You won't regret I promise!
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:57:49
I would say anything under 4K. With segwit activating on Wednesday, you could miss your chance.
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:58:45
Haha I did that then they muted my account so I can't even message the mods lol...
They must really hate me!
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:21:52
I agree. I made the mistake a couple days ago telling a friend he should invest some into it. Now he wants to chuck in 10k.... 
Luckily he hasn't actually bought it yet (was planning to Monday), so I'm thinking I will definitely send him a warning message that if he decides to invest, to make sure he reads up about it and it could always go down just as easily as up
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:02:04
It seems to have broken that trend thank god
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:15:34
I am the same man. I'm in AUS too. A week or so ago I said fuck it gonna buy a full coin so I did. Lucky I got in at 3k USD.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:30:06
For me, over $1500 profit in a week is pretty decent... i dont want to be tooo greedy.

Lol why would you think this is a scam? Wth? If it's on the blockchain then no real reason to worry
 
I really think you should do some research into how this whole thing works before assuming that something completely normal is a scam.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:34:39
I reckon around 3700
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:42:37
Well you missed a loop you hippie!
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:03:44
Dude I'm pretty I've sure I've even seen people talking about your post in YouTube vidz...
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:22:50
Depends how much you care about security. If you care a lot, then keeping any amount on there is a bad idea! If you don't own the private key you don't own the coin!
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:54:38
Electricity is better spent mining BTC than watching TV.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:31:21
So house like this only costs 400k USD? That's nuts! In Australia this would be a couple mil EASY!
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:54:09
Go to any bar/pub in Australia and you are paying minimum $8 for a pint of local beer.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:45:07
It should be worth more than that by 2100... I reckon $500k+ easy by 2100 (as long as nothing major happens to kill Bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:01:13
Nobody said BTC was ready to go mainstream... Maybe in a few years... The day BTC is suitable for buying coffee its game over... BTC wins...
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:33:05
Those trend lines look a bit dodgey IMO. You know that the trend lines should not be more than 1-2% off closes to be considered solid. 
Some of yours look more like 5-10% off.
Edit: also just realised that you are not even using the closes on the downward trend line. You should be using the top of the green candles, not the red like you have.
I still hope you are right ��
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:07:38
Good point. That is definitely a problem if you dump in a large sum and you are not earning enough fiat  to take advantage of dips etc.
Though I would feel sick if I decided to only chuck in 1 of my 4K, only to see it double into the next few days. Knowing how much potential profit I had lost
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:59:57
Nice video. May I ask around what price you bought in at? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:32:39
Agree! All those people who changed to BCH are gonna miss the free $$$
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:44:00
Oh well it's gone now
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:08:57
That's right! Much easier said than done!
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:18:59
Thanks! I didn't know that was the term.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:54:50
I didn't help out, but am still happy to take the thanks! You're a good man!
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:48:05
I read it, but did not read the previous one to compare to. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:56:18
Think you can do all that in 1 day?
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:58:52
Nobody can say. Your $200 could end up being 10k+ or it could be $1. In your case I would just hold it for a few years and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:28:42
Fuck BCH I sold mine  no regrets
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:15:29
You're right on the "unfounded opinions" part... People keep thinking it is some sort of pyramid/Ponzi scheme, but when I ask them why they think that, they cannot answer me.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:25:00
Great job... Sub 4K now... I BLAME YOU!
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:15:50
Umm did you even read the title?
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:25:15
I think a lot of people are selling their BTC to buy BCH and also a lot of people selling their BCH to buy BTC so it evens things out.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:55:06
Why are you thanking us? We didn't sell at $200.... Idiot
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:43:22
And why will it be destroyed?
Dumbest thing I've ever heard
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:45:07
Just trade all your BTC for the shittest alt coins you can find.
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:09:24
You know you don't have to buy full coins! Less than 0.2% of world population will ever own a full coin ...
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:09:35
All I can say is; IF YOU DONT OWN THE PRIVATE KEY, YOU DO NOT OWN THE BITCOIN! 
Even if it is safe, why would you not want to own what you have paid 100s-1000s of dollars for....
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:02:22
Lol so you sent 3k of Bitcoin to a random Chinese guy and just hoped he would give you the Dota items? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Jesus man...
You trust others WAY too much.
Edit: You're fucked. Soz
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:08:17
Ever heard of nicehash?
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:15:36
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:20:54
Yes but that's straight up money laundering 
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:23:40
This is what I'm planning on doing. Except I sold 25%
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:27:32
You realise EVERY account at one stage was less than 2 weeks old.... Even yours... What a knob.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:59:29
And now BTC is getting fucked. How do you feel?
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:20:15
IMO not the greatest doco.
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:13:15
Yes, but could mean this was just a dead cat bounce in which case we're in for possibly lower lows
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:20:33
It means you don't need to take it off the exchange. Meanin you are able to buy/sell quicker and for less fees.
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:33:12
I use coinjar. Haven't had any problems and you can link your bank account for withdrawals
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:47:31
Please tell me who has $2 trillion.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:26:22
think about it: the people who sold will most likely be able to buy in at a much lower price, therefore increasing their crypto holdings.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:17:38
Because China is not the only country in the world.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:37:42
Fuck this is good. Nice one!
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:58:25
That's what they said about world war 2 before it happened... 
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:26:03
The price just dropped from 5k to 3k in the last week. I Bought a lot of coin for a very good price. I am holding BTC  and I am also holding fiat to put into coin at a good opportunity. If it drops I win. If it goes up I win. Don't assume you know people or their position.
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:13:16
Might b worth $5
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:01:51
It might not be worthless, but it might not be worth thousands of dollars either. May I just ask why Bitcoin and not any other altcoins with a lower coins cap, more anonymity etc.? You do know other coins exist which blow Bitcoin out of the water right?
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:04:16
IKR... So you don't like takin risks? Good for you! But you don't need to act like you're better than the people that do... If you are a decent trader you can make a LOT more BTC/money than simply holding. I wish I had sold at 5k and bought in again at 3k.... 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:29:36
??? He is not missing it.... By selling and rebuying at a lower price is taking much more advantage of the dip than just "hodling". I agree with OP. Hodl to a point, but hodling no matter what can be a very bad move
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:17:38
Because China is not the only country in the world.
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:59:23
This is hilarious! I just sold a quarter of my holding to take some profit, but will most likely regret it as always! 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:16:06
I would say the latter. Nobody thinks Bitcoin is dead, but why not take some profit while it's still there
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:55:10
Sold all my BTC last night. Don't regret it for one second.
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:31:12
Get out now and rebuy lower
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:14:03
Most boring story ever...
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:45:33
Ummm maybe he's  referring to the fact be your friend thought an Mbtc was a BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:31:14
Nice try? Nice try at what? If you think this is just FUD think again... 
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:48:19
Omg that was like me haha. You will forget about it in a month or 2
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:07:22
Who is "we"? Random redditors?
I love how people just throw this shit out there...
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:38:25
I did this. Was up over $2k a few weeks ago... Sold today with a profit of $500. Will buy back when it's lower. I think it's definitely better to take your profit while it's still there. I'll tell u now... You will feel MUCH better knowing you made a profit rather than holding and seeing your money go down the drain with no option other than wait or sell at a loss.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:32:31
I think that's the problem though. The government is trying to stop people losing their money on scamcoins. Your saying th SK crypto market is bigger than their stock market? Well if that's true then sucks to be them. there goes 50% of that market in just a few weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:37:03
Don’t even worry. What’s the worst thing that could happen? You owe a few hundred bucks?
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:20:38
I sold quarter of my coin at 4K . Bout to buy back in
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:38:25

Umm if you haven't realised romeo_the_retard, fiat has a physical form. So no, you do not need the Internet/power to transact. Tell me how many physical bitcoins you own?
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:04:23
Yes but don't forget that the other big exchanges are closing on 30th oct. would t surprise me if we stay in a bearish market up until after November. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:55:10
Sold all my BTC last night. Don't regret it for one second.
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:37:50
I have a feeling it's not completely over yet 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:05:29
Please tell us what you think the price of Bitcoin will be once it is only being kept alive by 10 Japanese nerds.... Let me tell you now... It won't be much...
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:37:58
If you're worried just sell a portion of your holdings. Say 25%. This way if it goes up you wind and if it goes down you win cos you can just buy in for more
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:44:35
Every coin ever created is owned by "somebody"...
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:24:09
Why do you think it's current price is fair? In a flooded crypto market, with many coins being able to match if not succeed Bitcoin on basically all fronts, why not $300?
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:29:11
I wouldn't be doing that at this point in time IMO
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:07:38
Don't worry. This guy is a troll. He will go through posts and if somebody mentions one negative word about Bitcoin he starts calling names such as troll. Click baiter. FUD. He is just scared.
I know this because he did it to my post a few mins ago. No conversation or argument. Just name calling
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:20:59
No shit Sherlock... Reddit or for 5 days....
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:41:58
You can pretend it doesn't, but the value in fiat DOES matter. What's the point of owning Bitcoin if it has no value We can use to actually you know... Buy things???? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:14:12
Which country?
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:29:36

@_date: 2017-09-22 23:08:32
No. Satoshi is an idiot.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:02:46
Could always just sell a percentage, say 10-25%... Then if it goes down, you can just buy back in for more BTC and if it goes up again? No biggie!
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:21:30
What a boring-ass shirt...
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:04:46
Big sell off poloniex goin on right now by the looks
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:20:07
I am not a troller! Maybe I want to buy some more at a lower price... Ever think of that?
Actually Nevermind... Just continue blindly dismiss anything even remotely negative about BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:46:12
That's sad dude... Putting a badge on anything instantly makes you gay. Not that that's a bad thing...
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:56:09
Lol I love how when people point out the fact that there is a limited supply means it's going to go up in value forever. So what about the coins with 2 mil supply? Or coins with 4mil supply, or 10, or 15.... Bitcoin isn't the only coin with a coin cap (if you think it is then you are a retarded and need to go back to school) ... 
"Oh I know! I'll make a cryptocurrency with only 1 coin in existence! That means it's worth all the money in the universe right? APOCALYPSE RESISTANT!!!"
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:31:14

•Got scammed by obvious scam.
•Plays it off as, "I did in on purpose to help the BTC community!"
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:01:23
Edit: misinterpreted what you said.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:13:04
Thanks for the replies guys you answered my question perfectly! You make a good point about anybody just sending any amount to your wallet just to cause harm. So obvious :P Can't believe I didn't think of that... Multiple addresses is a good idea too.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:18:26
Gotcha! Cheers.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:04:19
I think you are just using this giant story where you were "helping" the BTC community as a cover for purely getting scammed by a very OBVIOUS scam. If anybody receives a random text and decides to send that random person money/BTC they are an idiot. Period. You didn't have to send them coins to know this was a scam.
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:24:18
Basically, keep them in coinbase if you don't want free coins.
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:55:06
Just sign up for a wallet which allows you to link your bank account if you simply wish to turn your BTC back into fiat. I use coinjar.com in Australia.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:15:49
Well I just tried to send .00004 through blockchain.info to my wallet and it did not allow me. Reason: The amount was too small to allow any mining fees.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:23:59
Is this guy blind? The overlay continues to go down around where we had our recent dip (mid july) and kept falling, but Bitcoin has rebounded.
Even if it does goes down, it would be more likely due to the split than the because of the overlay graph used.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:05:44
Thanks for the response guys! I thought that may have something to do with it. I just tried .0001 and it showed straight away on blockchain.info. Cheers!
