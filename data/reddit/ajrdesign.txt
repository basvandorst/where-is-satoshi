I have savings/checking accounts with them. No credit cards open with them.

When did this supposedly happen? I’ve had multiple BTC to USD transactions go through into capital one accounts no problem...

Damn for roughly $50k worth of coin I'd take a few days off just to find it. :D

Venezuela seems like a perfect case study for Bitcoin! It's just a bit concerning that it takes such a disaster for people to start realizing it's value tho.

The problem is the voice it's not clear to people who watch and trust these local channels where this POV is coming from. 
It's basically similar to how advertisers used to be able to make their adds look like content until it was regulated to force them to make it very clear that it's an advertisement. Sinclair is hiding behind the trust local news channels have built up to push a message instead of being transparent about where that message is coming from.

True, but surely the document doesn't warrant no credit at all. When I was in 8th grade just turning in something at all would get you into the 'C' range. It sounds to me like this teacher was probably too lazy and apathetic to actually grade something they didn't know about. Both of my parents are teachers and I know how horribly lazy a lot of teachers are (hear plenty of stories about them) so I'm inclined to believe that this teacher is probably being awful.
