You are not right.
Localbitcoins charges 1% fee from sellers and they reflect this in the price.
In the bot you have about 1 - 2% benefits.

No, you and localbitcoins ;)

I understand this :)
"Localbitcoins is dying" - it just header for starting a hot discussion.
The bot is better than Localbitcoins for many parameters, but it is new and not known service yet.
