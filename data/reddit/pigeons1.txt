The darkwallet site and materials and developers say darkwallet will be available on firefox as well by the end of the year. I wondered that too, but they gotta start somewhere.

"Ideally, we would just leave Cryptsy and move to Poloniex, which seems to have a working exchange, no security incidents,"
Look into this again, they have had more than one security incident losing big bucks. Arguably they handled them satisfactorily, but just pointing this out since its not what you said and you don't seem to be aware of them.

How does litecoin innovate? Its just a clone of fairbrix which is a clone of tenebrix.

OP didn't say for a crime relating to bitcoin. Last we heard from Trendon Shavers he was in jail for a domestic abuse arrest. I don't have the link handy, I'll look for it. Probably out by now but never saw anything after that other than that he refused to accept or pick up the certified letter informing him of the default judgement against him for failing to appear in court to defend the civil bitcoin case. And if you follow the money, done pretty well actually by the SEC, it looks like there is no "hoard". He was a horrible "day trader" and also spent his marks' money on spa treatments, truck repair, dinners, etc.

Wow, this has nothing to do with bitcoin. I am very disappointed with Emily Spaven and that coindesk article. Here is some information on Rob Gray and the Mulligan Mint:
