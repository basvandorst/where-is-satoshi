to be fair, it's true for a lot of fools who bought in at $19k then panic sold. 
The number of people who struck it rich with Bitcoin is relatively small, much smaller than people think.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:18:43
There are more people trying to get rich quick, but it rises and falls with media coverage/bubble bursting. That's not a good sign of BTC's overall health. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:34:48
I don't understand how people can look at how useless Bitcoin is both as a currency and as a store of value and confidently say it will have a greater market capitalization than the US Dollar. It's so laughably absurd.

Given the last time this happened Bitcoin went from $1,000 to $200, probably not. We may be in the early stages of a massive price drop and long stagnation. This isn't even the tip of the drop.

I've been following crypto since 2011 and I've been hearing this since back then too. Every year we're on the verge of mass adoption. Every year it doesn't happen and every year it's a new excuse. This year it's even worse, as the small progress made over eight years was rolled back as more companies stopped accepting it due to sky-high fees and transaction delays caused by bitcoin's fundamental scaling flaws and volatility. 


Well, they're going to have to do something. There's outright fraud and investment swindles going on at the core. One person single-handedly manipulated the price to increase ten-fold a few years ago. Automated and carefully orchestrated trades are bringing in big profit for Wall St. fraudsters and leaving gullible fools who buy into the "BUY HIGH AND HODL" mentality holding the purse strings. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:01:40
And how many exchanges are there now? Coinbase? And... um... 
Coinbase has taken the spot of Mt. Gox as a "too big to fail" centralized exchange. It's going to be a fun time when the bubble pops to see if CB can handle the bank runs given they can't even process transactions fast enough now. At least they're somewhat playing by teh rules (FDIC and all that jazz). 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:12:20
If adoption is going up why are more businesses quitting accepting Bitcoin than starting to accept it? 
And generally the price of commodities is related to news about said commodities - ie China worries causing a lot of the pats crashes. A lack of that is a good sign its pure greed driving up the price. 
And market cap is a pretty valid thing to look at...
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:38:10
To be fair, no one cares because interest and utility in Bitcoin as a currency is dead.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:48:31
Can you name a single event directly tied to its current price? And justify its a $292 billion market cap for something that's actually falling in adoption instead of rising? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:39:25
That's not a logical way to look at it though. No matter how badly Bitcoin falls you can always say "well it's still up since [x amount of days/months/years]." 
Oh, Bitcoin fell to $10. "Well it's still up since this time eight years ago!" 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:40:00
No, ever year there's a new centralized exchange and people urging adoption of decentralized exchanges which never happens.

@_date: 2018-01-25 15:00:28
Yes, a commodity with absolutely zero utility outside of making a quick buck is going to reach a market cap greater than most major first-world currencies combined.
At this point I havce to wonder if *anyone* on this sub who understands Bitcoin actually believes this tripe, or blindly upvotes it to fool gullible purse-holders for the inevitable crash.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:51:21

@_date: 2018-01-01 15:28:50
I upvoted you. A market cap of $500 billion is insane for a platform with fundamental scalabitliy flaws and only practical uses in buying drugs and (attempting) getting rich quick. You even have to pay capital gains tax on any Bitcoin you spend in goods transactions... LOL. No one's got time for that.

Unless this was a bubble. Which in all likelihood it was. Driven by wall street and John Q. Public Jr. investors trying to make a quick buck. 
Can you really justify a Bitcoin market cap higher than first-world currencies if by and large the only mainstream use case is making a quick buck in a heavily manipulated market? 
I *think* 20k was a ceiling. It won't get any higher, and if it does it'll seriously compromise Bitcoin's long-term future as a currency.
And blindly tossing your investment away and ignoring all negative news and HODLING" is awful advice.

Coinbase has all but become the next "too big to fail" centralized exchange, and there are already many reports of people having issues with it... when the bubble does pop fully it'll be interesting to see how Coinbase fares with the bank runs. 
And FWIW [this report]( just came out yesterday which is pertty damaging to Bitcoin's trust.

Hey, you asked a question, I provided my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:23:16
When Bitcoin rises rapidly, people make money. No one complains when a bubble gets bigger. 
When bitcoin falls rapidly, people lose money. Lots of people complain when a bubble pops, especially the suckers caught holding the purse strings who bought in at $19k so you could offload your coins. 
And ESPECIALLY when the market shows shocking similarities to the great crypto crash of 2014, in which the price fell from $1k to $200 and took close to two years to recover. This is going to be a big, ugly fall, followed by a long period of stagnation. 
Simple logic. Why does this tripe get upvoted? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:48:29
Because his dad is the bitcoin ceo/s
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:07:17
This is pretty poor logic. No matter where it is you can go back and say "but we're above where we were x amount of time ago" by moving the goalposts. 
"yeah it may have fallen to $10 but look it's still up 500 percent from March 2011!" 
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:50:58

@_date: 2018-01-22 15:54:32
I pulled out of Bitcoin long ago when it became apparent to me everyone lost focus of its future and only cares about short-term money-making, and the glaring flaws in the platform became too big to avoid. 
To me calling this a "dip" is quite worrying even for someone with no skin in the game. The last time we had losses like this Bitcoin fell from &gt;1k to &lt;$200 and took nearly two years to build momentum again (it was right after the Mt. Gox fiasco). I think we're headed this way again with all the media hype on turning Bitcoin into a money making scheme. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:02:56
I'm not. I don't think we're anywhere near the bottom. I fully expect Bitcoin to fall to below $2,000 before all is said and done. Quite possibly &lt;$1,000.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:05:21
I don't think so. The last time a major drop happened in 2014 it caused stagnation for close to two years. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:05:56
I'm commenting here to tell everyone "I told you so" when Bitcoin crashes to below $5,000 (minimum) in 30 days or less.

Except when you want to cash out at an all-time high you need gullible fools holding the purse strings. I don't buy your "we're all making money" mantra for a second. You only care about yourself. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:33:26


False. More businesses are quitting accepting Bitcoin due to sky-high fees, transaction issues, and price volatility than new businesses accepting it. And most of them are only doing so to attract business with people hoarding Bitcoin; they're not expecting people to actually use BTC as a real currency. 


"Improved" tech which flies in the face of Staoshi's original vision of Bitcoin and shows fundamental flaws in the platform. Now you have even more people controlling a supposedly unregulated currency. 


Only in the context of BTC vs. USD and tulip mania. That's not good news for something that's supposed to be a currency. 


Are you a real estate market investor too? First I'm hearing of this. 


LOL. Just LOL. 


They solve the issues Bitcoin has without increasing the power a few people have over a supposedly decentralized and unregulated system. I hardly call that useless. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:59:46
Every single coin is dropping because all crypto is still heavily reliant on Bitcoin's performance. Mostly because the only way to actually acquire and use altcoins is to buy them with bitcoin. Similar to gold. 
And this "Chinese new year" thing has to be the dumbest excuse I've ever seen peddled on this sub for a drop. Like, even if we take it at face value and assume it's true, you're admitting Bitcoin's utility as a currency is so non-existent that the price is going to tank every time people need money because it needs to be converted to fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:28:23
I think you're right - and it's the reason you don't see people trading gold to buy a loaf of bread anymore.

@_date: 2018-01-22 16:10:20
You're playing a pretty dangerous game. Every day Bitcoin's usefulness as a currency goes down. Networks get overloaded, transaction times delayed, more businesses stop accepting it than start, governments threaten crackdowns, instability drives away people using it for store of value, etc etc. There has to be a ceiling and I think we've hit it, or are very close to hitting it - can you realistically justify such a useless commodity holding a market cap close to major first-world currencies when currently by and large the single largest use case is to make a quick profit in a heavily manipulated market? And the second largest is illegal drugs?

None of your post refutes the idea that this is a bubble though. Showing them that graph actually strengthens that idea. There was nothing but blind faith and moneybag-eyes behind that massive price jump. Adoption fell significantly as companies and businesses pulled out of accepting Bitcoin, sky-high fees and transaction delays crippled its utility as a currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:45:06
Well for a pretty sizable bulk of the community that just joined it is news to them. Look at it from an outsider's perspective - "Bitcoin" and "Ponzi scheme" in teh same headline looks scary regardless of how many early warning signs there were.

That would put the market cap well beyond the top first-world fiat currencies combined. For a tech that has lost its utility as a currency and a store of value and is only fueled by blind greed to get rich. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:59:32
Well, a major Ponzi scheme was just discovered. That shook investor confidence. 
And "mass adoption" of Bitcoin as a currency, and even a store of value, is not happening. Since the bubble began more stores and businesses have stopped accepting it than started. Currency utility has all but diminished with sky-high fees and transaction delays, and the "solution" still hasn't been fully implemented and goes against bitcoin's core design philosophy. 
Discussion has moved away from adoption and even technical areas and more towards short-term profit. New money investors are getting involved who don't have a clue about what Bitcoin and blockchain tech actually is and the broad impact it could have. 
I don't think there really had to be a catalyst. It was obvious this wasn't going to sustain itself. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:06:24
No, it's not. There has to be a peak. Bitcoin's uselessness as a currency and store of value doesn't justify a market cap higher than major first-world currencies. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:49:15
That price would put Bitcoin's market cap at several times higher than the USD. That makes no logical sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:27:23

You are in a very small minority. A LOT of early investors sold when they doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled their returns in ~2012-2013 because, let's be real, Bitcoin doesn't really have a viable future. I haven't seen a single post here praising a local business for accepting Bitcoin... it's all about how much it will go up compared to the USD. Combine that with sky-high fees and delays, and a "solution" that pretty much eliminates the need for Bitcoin... It's just a matter of how long it can carry on like TF2 hats. 
A vast majority of investors now bought in at 10k, or 12k, or even 19k... it's FOMO fools rushing to cash in on a get rich quick scheme with no real interest in Bitcoin's future.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:05


Bitcoin hasn't been a viable currency for months. At least years back there was a *chance* for mass adoption but with the sky-high fees and delays in confirming transactions Bitcoin's time to become a legitimate currency is long gone. No one is going to use bitcoin if it either takes hours to process a transaction or ~$5-$6 in fees to buy a cup of coffee. So if BTC is dead as a currency... what's with the price? And that begs the question to Wall Street/investor manipulation. 
That being said other cryptos do show promise in that they can avoid the issues Bitcoin is currently facing. If you are serious about buying into the future of currency I recommend investing elsewhere, not in Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:07:57

No. Bitcoin is a very poor investment and is really only for tech nerds who don't really understand investing.

At the one coffee shop in Seattle that accepts it?

Yeah, drugs. That's it. Not sure if a blatantly illegal utility is worth touting.

Show this website to the vast majority of fools caught holding the purse strings who bought in at $19K. And remember if it wasn't for those fools, YOU would not have been able to cash out.

I come to this subreddit every few months to see if ya'll are actually talking about the widespread Bitcoin adoption I was promised in 2011... or are still criclejerking over the price because all Bitcoin is to you people is a get rich quick scheme.
Guess it's still the latter.

You mean exactly like Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:05:40
You mean when it lost like 80 percent of its value and stagnated for close to 2 years?
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:01:25
Lol no. For one the moronic "HODL" meme would have convinced most of those easily fooled suckers to keep HODLing through 19k and will continue through this hard crash (which is not a "correction"). 
Never mind how difficult it actually is to cash out a lot of bitcoin at once, which would have been the smart move at 19K since it's never going to hit that again (unless you can justify a Bitcoin market cap &gt; than the USD). You have to wonder how many people actually managed to make more than $500k in pure profits by actually cashing out. 
Finally... anyone running into a dealership to buy a Lambo and who doesn't have at least $4 million in the bank and a solid plan to grow that investment OUTSIDE OF CRYPTO will be broke by the time this crypto fad dies. Those cars are giant money pits. Common lottery winners' fallacy too. Easily going to cost several hundred thousand dollars in maintenance in addition to the high asking prices of those cars, and taxes, etc.

Yeah Bitcoin is totally going to totally have a market cap higher than every first-world currency combined. /s
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:59:33
I would say trading at a stable price with a market cap that justifies its uses. Even if it were to gain mainstream acceptance today, a market cap higher than that of all major first-world currencies combined is absurd. So I doubt it hitting above $20k again will happen, and if it does it's NOT good for bitcoin.

There was absolutely no telling what would have happened in that period of stagnation. The tech could have very likely fizzled out and died since, you know, massive, glaring problems with the fundamental platform became apparent, adoption slowed to a crawl then started moving in the other direction as more companies stopped accepting it than started, and regulatory pressure. 
Hindsight is 20/20 and you can only confidently say that depression was the time to buy because we know now it rebounded massivly. 
And there is still no telling what the future for Bitcoin will hold, given all these problems have been amplified. Past performance is not a promise of future gains.

What are they supposed to do? Crypto is a fad, they can't invest millions into upgraded production and manufacturing to support a fad because what happens when the mania dries up? Nvidia and AMD are left with millions in loan and bond payments and even more money in continued costs of facilities now churning out more units than there is demand for. It's the exact same reason Nintendo consoles are always impossible to buy for the first few months. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:52:12
Yeah, but can we at least be honest and admit it's no different than gambling? 
@_date: 2015-04-01 13:28:58
It amuses me that people actually see a conspiracy here because they're so delusional they refuse to accept their Bitcoin hero was a naive homicidal thug who tried to kill people who got in his way. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:06:21
No. Bitcoin should not be viewed as an investment vehicle and people peddling this nonsense here either own mining operations, bought or mined a few in the early days and HODLed. 
Sadly they need gullible fools to hold the purse when the bubble pops.

And I think you'll find the number of "true believers" is so small it's insignificant compared to those in it for a profit.

Nice whataboutism
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:52:47
Please tell me people don't actually believe Bitcoin will one day have a market cap higher than every single first-world currency combined. That's plain delusion. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:39:37
If your currency only exists to immediately be converted into another currency.... can you really call it a currency at all?

Or someone who made a lot of money very quickly, but their luck has run dry and they're now financing a car they can't afford.

No. Bitcoin is d ead. What you see here and on all these articles is people far down the rabbit hole desperately trying to recruit new victims to drive up the value of their own investments.
