Hello Jjerryy.
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:45:18
Check again he said that in reply to "there are total 239 Mnemonic words".
@_date: 2018-08-12 06:31:59
FTFY: But ultimately, who gives a BCH?
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:44:46
@_date: 2018-05-28 02:03:05


It's not 12 seed words but 12 pairs=24 seed words.
@_date: 2018-05-26 12:37:00
But wouldn't changing address means different QR code? Also if QR code is the answer then all the clues are invalid.
@_date: 2018-05-26 12:10:32
Total 116 Bip39 words in picture.(not counting s/es/ed words) ���� 
@_date: 2018-05-26 13:26:36
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:33:05
After spending too much time looking at picture I'm probably seeing things ��. Lambda is "y" upside down. "try" "early" "infinity" and "easily" ends with y.  Also "lost" "cost's'" and "almost" ends with "ost". Maybe op wrote a rap song lyrics.
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:19:35
Lambda is in whitepaper so...
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:59:22
lol found 5 wallet with 0 balance in it(12 seed word). Why you u do this op?
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:16:49
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:49:23
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:13:47
This transaction means 00212121 as a clue. Initially there was no clue given by op, we were probably supposed to find this by ourselves.
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:02:39
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:16:20
need more clues. It's been 9 days since you posted and no one's even close to solving it.
@_date: 2018-05-31 09:12:11
6 pairs only? "Code easily attack early almost open" are probably seed words. Need 6 more words(3 pairs) then?
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:28:09


**That explains "you can throw at least half of them out".The words that aren't in image are useless.There is nothing more to the first clue, trust me. Don't waste time on it and move to the next clue**
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:10:28
I found about 28 empty wallets. Correct order of seed words is IMPORTANT. Otherwise millions of wallets can be found using same 23 seed words+checksum.
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:22:48
What language is this? 
@_date: 2018-05-22 05:15:19
You are getting close.
@_date: 2018-05-26 13:26:29
He who must not be named.
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:16:47
Could also be Roman 1(number) ����
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:47:37
You know that seed is for recovering the password, don't you? You find the valid seed of the given address, you solve the puzzle.
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:21:58
"CCS" is not in whitepaper. Also "John". 
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:46:43

@_date: 2018-05-31 02:13:36
Yes, he did.  Yesterday he sent 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2008 sats to the address. All are dates. Don't know what that means though.
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:04:46
check here  (Type your seed words into the BIP49 Mnemonic section. Scroll down to the Derived Addresses section. If matches address given by op= solved)
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:40:55
can you explain 'code' to 'easily' and 'almost' to 'open'?
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:53:22
Lmao op changed the address =private key definitely changed. So if all the clues are still valid then it's a seed and NOT A PRIVATE KEY(with passphrase removed/reduced complications in passphrase).
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:04:13
any idea about "00212121" ?
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:23:32
What about "CCS" and "John". They are not in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:11:49
Early is inside sigma symbol and attack is inside C.Code and easily both are near "W". Now give me my Bitcoin ����������
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:35:17
tail is between "t","a" of attacker and "i" of transaction and "l" is 12th character of english language(tail is near 12 too). so definitely tail is the one.  
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:49:03
Probably fake 
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:12:45
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:54:51
it's classic 13th century scam you innocent soul.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:18:02
congrats 
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:18:16
12th pair depends upon what logic you used for first 11 pairs.
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:07:56
Please, make it a trend.
Some of my non-crypto friends are trying to solve that 1 BTC puzzle. I tried convincing them to invest in crypto in past but they weren't interested. But now they think that BTC is cool �� �� �� �� 
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:12:53
There are [2] [7] [5] in the white paper. (Search "7" you'll find). But ordering them 257 might be clue you are referring to. Good luck .
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:11:27
Rotate logo  B with respect to the mark near 20020801(small point/square near Z) . Since I'm not good with Photoshop but you can give it a try(make logo parallel to X and Infinity symbol, also try increasing/decreasing size). Maybe that will reveal something about pairs and their order.
@_date: 2018-05-21 18:18:07
Order of appearance in whitepaper 
Alphabetical order
Distance from X
Distance from center...
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:12:10
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:33:27
Need more clues.
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:16:12
probably not

This is not a job interview.

Address stars with 3 so must be 24+ word seed.
@_date: 2018-05-31 07:24:25
It's a puzzle and clues must be hard to find. He is quite from more than a week, it must be him. Thanks for all these downvotes though, was just trying to help, thought could be useful.
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:20:29
Puzzle is slowly dying. Very less activity now.
need more clue. And list all of them in single post as try+1 or 00212121 might be invalid now(after one less step,-1). Also what wallet you used?

@_date: 2018-05-28 14:10:00
What's the common relation between code-easily, attack-early, almost-open?
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:10:30
"c code" in whitepaper. c is a programming language.
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:20:20
What does "lost transaction costs almost users" means? Most of them aren't BIP39 words so can't be seed.
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:35:59
Lambda is "y" upside down . Earl"y" infinit"y" easil"y" tr"y". 
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:07:36
What do you mean by removed clue nº8?
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:20:41
Yes. I believe list is uploaded in previous comments.
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:47:54
Golden ratio shit

@_date: 2018-06-03 06:22:59
Infinity and beyond one?

How can you gift 2 goals and still considered better? Gifting 2 goal is bad, really really bad.
