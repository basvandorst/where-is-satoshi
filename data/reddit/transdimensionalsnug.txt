It depends how you look at it.  Technically Inferior could mean different things depending on context.  If you have a simpler implementation that is well tested, then maybe it is less susceptible to attack over say something like ethereum that is way more complex and just now being tested.  You could measure it by network strength, inflationary versus deflationary etc.. we need to define the question a little more in order to answer it.

You're on the right track here asking tough questions.  If you own ether as a speculative investment you should be watching 21 inc closely.  Even Vitalik is [trying to front](  The OP in that thread asked about smart contracts and media hashing and Vitalik completely dodged it and focused on the tired arguments we have seen here over the last few days.  That implies to me that he is worried.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:19:17
One of the big attractions to ethereum is that it has a built in programming language to write smart contracts and distributed applications.  21inc looks like it may have that ability as well except that it will be doing it on top of the bitcoin blockchain.
  
EDIT:  This scares the shit out of ether speculators and my down-votes are evidence of this.

You probably won't be able to duplicate the software and the 21inc chip and there is a real possibility you will not be able to integrate with the 21inc back-end without their chip.  We really need more information for a definitive answer but right now, I'd guess you have to pay to play with 21inc.
  
Keep an eye out for 21inc AMA on reddit, many of us have hard questions for them that should lead to answers.

It's praised because it builds on bitcoin.  It is something we have all talked about over the years and it is expected.  In the early days you had a lot of people speculating about where this experiment would go and discussion about public companies using the blockchain always met with controversy.  Some see it as inevitable and a natural evolution while others see it as a threat.  But the conclusion has always been that if bitcoin succeeded, this would happen and it might even need to happen for bitcoin to succeed in the long term.
  
Their ToS is exactly what you can expect from any company.  There is no freedom being removed by the introduction of 21inc and their platform.  It certainly doesn't "take away even the most basic freedoms bitcoin has to offer", that's a huge stretch.  Bitcoin would have already failed if it was that fragile.  You will continue to have all of the freedoms you have now, but with more options available to you and it's hard to argue that this is a bad thing.
  
In the end:  the honeybadger don't care who you are or whether you're even a person.  It will keep on keeping on because nobody knows you're a fridge on the blockchain.

You touch on Ethereum and how it solves real problems yet you ignore the fact that 21 inc could do everything Ethereum is doing but on top of the bitcoin blockchain.  Wouldn't Vitalik give his left nut for his own hardware platform that he could use to finally implement Proof of Stake?  Dismissing this potential and 21inc is a path to ignorance.
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:18:16
Don't forget that Satoshi was essentially caught with his pants down when it came to mining pools, he admitted himself that he didn't see that coming and you have to think that it probably scared the shit out of him when he looked at the potential.  Bitcoin is his baby, he had all of these great ideas and already had been working on a framework for a marketplace, but when he realized the implication for mining pools he had to realize that he was potentially working for someone else in the future if he continued.
  
With current code, it's inevitable that a company or group of companies will own &gt;51% of the hashrate.  I want to see Balaji be a part of that.  Balaji is doing exactly what Satoshi should be doing if he was still active.  Balaji is working to secure the network.

Agree on confirmations ahead of time and charge for time if they want a full 6 which is really unnecessary.  Then play with btc.blockr.io and see how many confirmations you see on blockr.io before you see it completed on coinbase.com, I think it was 4 last time I checked.  Coinbase owns btc.blockr.io and that's why I use it for this.
I've done hundreds of transactions since I started using blockr and I have never seen a transaction fail that showed at least 1 confirmation on blockr.

It depends on the provider and the person.  I've introduced people to bitcoin who have bought tens of thousands of dollars worth and they leave it on Coinbase.  I helped them set up two-factor and set restrictions in the account for added security, but we both agree that they are not the type of person to manage their coins on their own and I do not want the responsibility.
  
These are people who are sort of technical, highly educated but sloppy because they have a lot of money.  I do not think I would trust another exchange like this other than Coinbase and we do discuss the risks involved.  As soon as I see a bullet proof solution, I will introduce them to it.  It's all about weighing the risk.

Given that Balaji has extensive history with academia, it is not unreasonable to assume that he is familiar with various types of licensing schemes that employ a hardware key.  I'd wager on the possibility that you can't run the software without the chip, or at least you can't join the 21inc ecosystem without it.  I'd bet real money on that.

They are not referring to bitcoin.  They can't build a business solution around a software project that can change the code they are running at any time without their consent.

That figure only represents paper money in circulation and does not reflect savings in banks.  There is roughly 8 Trillion in banks right now.

Bitcoin doesn't "go down" though.  When the memory pool fills up, miners just get pickier about what transactions are being accepted into their blocks and people adjust their behavior as it continues and awareness spreads.  Once we have something like replace-by-fee then people can compete for the small blocks or wait if they aren't in a hurry.  I expect this would be temporary as a constantly full memory pool would result in code changes without payment rails that don't exist yet.

I happen to agree with the moderation but probably for different reasons.  I think that reddit is not a good platform for this type of debate because it is easily gamed and a minority can be very loud and appear to most as a majority.

I really like Roger's passion and I admire his idealism, but it is not realistic to say that bitcion will stop war.  He even demonstrates evidence of this through his use of bitcoin to promote vigilantism.  Whenever he is hacked or extorted, he uses bitcoin to place a bounty.  Imagine if Anonymous could hire an army to physically attack a target anywhere in the world.  We are not far from that future if cryptocurrencies become adopted on a global scale.  So bitcoin won't stop war, it will only change who starts it and how it is funded(sustained).  People will still suffer.

If it was that easy, there would be no price difference.  It is hard to get fiat into BTC-e and since it is operated by anonymous actors, many people won't bother to take the chance. So you are left with a bunch of bitcoin holders on BTC-e waiting for cash to enter the system and they are going to lose patience.  This will result in the slow bleeding of BTC-e bitcoin to other exchanges and the eventual death of BTC-e.

Explain what is contrary to what I have claimed.  If I read this right, you're claiming that buying bitcoin and sending it to a device is more elegant and faster while a device that simply generates it on its own or at the issuance of a command is not elegant or fast.  Remember, you weren't questioning ROI so cost is not a factor.  I'm not even asking you to consider the plethora of other use cases the presence of the mining chip introduces, just explain what you said and how my statements are contrary to it.  Can you do that?
@_date: 2015-11-18 00:51:27
If people aren't questioning ROI, then why are you questioning it?  You said *"how is mining Bitcoin in device a cheaper, faster and more elegant solution than just sending Bitcoin to the device for it to use?"* which shows a complete lack of understanding on your part.  And you are still asking about cost.  Nothing is faster then typing a command and having thousands of satoshis to start testing with.  This is not a consumer product and it is not meant to ROI and you absolutely get coins right away to develop with by just typing a command or running the miner and letting it do its thing.  Full stop, end of story time to move on.

Andreas's quote can be applied to a lot of activity around here, not just development of bitcoin.
  
Look at how he is participating in 21.co threads.  He is not being objective and is attacking an SDK as if it was meant for consumers when he has to know it isn't.  He can't say the things he is saying if he acknowledges this so he doesn't in order to continue.  This is malicious.
  
Example from this thread: ". Now we can all use the 21Chain for only $400 plus all the electricity the device can consume..."
  
"We can all" implies all of us, not just developers but this isn't meant for anyone other than developers.  If he acknowledged that in his wording, he would just look like a fool.  So he is using the subtle approach which is what a lot of people who just want to rile people up and troll do.  He is not being intellectually honest.

I think about this a lot.  That is a great question and I think we need to see what kind of value-add there is for the consumer before we can say for sure.  This is not a consumer device.  At a basic level, having millions of these chips operating at the same time would result in a significant portion of the network hashrate and the power that comes with that.  So from that perspective, in order to convince consumers to "feed the beast" there has to be something there for them.

The down-votes are to be expected due to the passion revolving around this subject.  I'm personally block size agnostic and just want what's best for the long term success of bitcoin.
    
It's a mistake to assume that we can scale bitcoin to serve the global population by just changing the code.  That doesn't serve the reality of the situation which is that there are other bottlenecks that also have to be overcome.  From bandwidth to hardware, things need to evolve, not just the code.
  
I think we are in good hands and I feel like bitcoin will succeed either way and I am happy to use it as a store of value while spending using side-chains or purely using the bitcoin protocol.  I do not want special interests to get their fingers into driving development and the more we cater to a larger population the more demands will be put on the protocol and developers to perform.  So I see it as a can of worms if we start down the path of trying to make the code one-size-fits-all.

I agree.  But I think it is inevitable that as long as bitcoin continues without major problems, the following two things will probably happen:
  
a) those payment rails will be built on top of the bitcoin blockchain and will settle using the bitcoin blockchain.
  
b) the block size will be increased when actually needed(I'm talking sustained and natural transaction volume).
  
I can envision a time where we are increasing the block size conservatively and it still isn't enough.  Side-chains are inevitable at this point and are desirable as they can create an entire industry around the bitcoin blockchain.  My worry is how those players will try to influence the code when they get bigger.

Pretty much everyone who has used Coinbase has been through this.  It used to be that you had to wait five days from your first transaction before you could buy another amount.

That's right, war is expensive, that's why I said that we aren't far from that future if cryptocurrencies become adopted on a global scale.  The value will also scale up and create wealth, wealth with which to start and sustain wars.  Look at Roger Ver with his bitcoin wealth and his use of it to create bounties.  You can argue the intent all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that it is an example of how that type of activity can scale from one guy hiring anonymous people on the internet to find someone and expose them to governments hiring a bunch of anonymous people to go attack something.

The chip allows 21 inc to do many things:
  
- It allows them to enumerate their ecosystem.
  
- It allows them to leverage the distributed nature of the platform to mine bitcoin.
  
- It is a licensing mechanism in that you need the chip to participate(right now).  So no bad actors that you can't deal with if they become malicious.
  
- It allows anyone with the device to develop which is its main purpose.  I could send this to anyone in the world with an internet connection and they can get started developing right away.
  
- It allows them to more easily navigate regulatory issues by not pre-loading the device.
  
- Bitcoin in the system, stays in the system unless you send it outside.  So no bitcoin is lost when in the system(not going to expound on this).
  
- The chip is potential for 21inc to establish themselves as a major owner of the bitcoin network hashrate which is power.  Power is money and freedom to make change or continue a status quo.

My impression of the situation at the time is that Roger basically trusted that his friend was telling the truth and the paperwork was valid.  I actually admire him for sticking his neck out there for a friend and think he must have learned a hard lesson from it.  It's is clear now that nobody except for Mark Karpeles really knew the truth.  
  
So your real issue with Roger is his loyalty and inability to detect lies, which can only get better over time as he gains more experience.  Lay off the guy and lets see what he can bring.  He has enough bitcoin to live comfortably for the rest of his life but he is spending it and his valuable time trying to grow bitcoin even more instead of living it up on hookers and blow.

@_date: 2015-11-10 17:57:42


  
Everything.  It makes perfect sense to build a device that can claim a stake on your network in a way that you can enumerate it and measure your ecosystem.  You can then safely send it bitcoin and know it is going into your ecosystem for its intended purpose.  If the device shipped without bitcoin or the ability to instantly get it once you are set up, then developers would have the additional task of having to go acquire bitcoin and send it to the device.
  
This device is a framework for things to come and when you start to tease apart the potential of the various aspects you quickly realize this is potentially a massive game changer in our space.  It is exactly the type of thing that Satoshi would be working on if he continued developing in this space.  21.co has not only given us a platform to put ethereum out of business, they are doing it in a way that contributes to the security of the network at scale while not adding unneeded complexity to the underlying protocol.  
  
So if they are a success and I believe they will be, then they will be a major player in the world of bitcoin.  I want them to threaten to own 51% of the network, this really needs to happen sooner rather than later.  It is only a matter of time before it happens and I very much want it to happen in the USA and not someplace like China.  I trust Balaji and his team, just like I would trust Satoshi.  To me they are one in the same.

@_date: 2015-11-02 21:32:57
Yes.  The problem is that you can only track how far beyond the block reward they have moved without knowing more about the addresses they are moving to.  So we can see which coins are moving and which ones aren't and then make guesses.  Those with the best tools and data will make the best guesses.  
Example: the majority of block rewards are divided among pools of small miners.  So when a payout happens it is not clear exactly when it is cashed out.  Lets say you are a small miner and you receive just enough to cover costs and you are only interested in doing that.  You would immediately sell your rewards as you get them.  That sale may result in your coins "resting" in an exchanges cold wallet.  To an outsider looking in, it might look like a miner is holding when in actuality they sold immediately.  But to someone who knows what addresses are the exchanges cold wallets, you can say definitively that those coins were sold and when.  So the completeness of the picture you are asking for depends entirely on who answers and how much data they have.  The more they know the less likely they are to give up that information because it is literally as good as money.
  
@_date: 2015-11-17 01:51:53


   
It won't always be this way, not without changes to our regulatory system and I don't see that happening soon.

He's pushing the debate to somewhere else, no one is being prohibited from having intelligent debate.  And if it wasn't prohibited, it would still need to be censored in order to keep it *intelligent*.
The fact the reddit is so easily gamed, makes this not a good venue for this type of debate.  Especially now when you have a lot of new users piling in because of the price.  This is the perfect storm that would allow a few to coerce a lot of new people who don't know the consequences for their actions to be led in one direction or another.
  
It is no wonder that certain people are so emphatic that the debate happen here where it can be easily gamed by bots and sock puppets to convince people to run one client or another to affect consensus.  I agree with what the mods are doing, but I don't think it is for the same reasons.

That's simply not true.  No one can reverse the bounty should he choose to pay it out and it can all be done in an anonymous manner because you aren't using traditional payment channels that are slow and tracked.  In some places, he could be arrested for his actions, so he could also issue this bounty in an anonymous manner and get results from an anonymous person.  If he offered the bounty using traditional payment channels, very skilled hackers wouldn't even bother because they aren't interested in the risks to themselves, but with crypto, they can stay in the dark and perform the task.  He can reach the widest audience of willing participants using crypto and not be limited to local resources and the liabilities they introduce.

We can moon with or without a block increase.  No block increase means that bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value while we wait for rails to be built on top of it.

That's not true, governments usually can't fund their armies through taxation and this results in them relying on a basket of solutions.
  


  
This is only somewhat true.  Bitcoin being an open ledger presents the possibility that governments will slowly learn who owns what and then go after them.  The technology itself presents government with a bunch of solutions that they can use on their own, one of those is issuing their own crypto currency.  Imagine if governments maintained complete control over their money from issuance for the life of the money?
  


  
Desperation is a powerful weapon.  Make a society desperate and they will do almost anything.  But with crypto, we don't need to think of armies in traditional terms.  We can start to form other types of armies comprised of willing participants that are in it for money, ideology or both.  These armies won't be restricted to borders or any one country, they could be global armies.  The possibilities are immense.

That simply isn't true because you can't calculate any of that without also being able to predict the price.  If this was true, miners would always know what the price will be in the future and plan around it and we wouldn't be here having this discussion.

There are entire markets that revolve around buying and selling gift cards.  These markets pay anywhere from 10-90% of face value depending on what it is.  A Starbucks gift card can be sold for 70% of its face value.  When I get gift cards as gifts that I have no intention of using, I often sell them online for money.  Those companies that bought my gift card turn around and sell them in bulk to companies or individuals for more than what they paid.  This is pretty standard stuff and is in no way a scam.

Bitcoin transactions happen on the blockchain and in order to interact directly with the bitcoin blockchain, you need internet access.

We live in a world where people are taught from a young age to respect their peers and follow the law, to look to others for guidance and listen to the state and seek welfare from it.  It simply won't happen in the way you describe as much as I wish it would given that would be a better world to live in, a world where everyone takes personal responsibility and decides to act or not.
  
In the world we live in, what you suggest leads to central systems and decision makers where you either get on board or suffer.  It's happening every day on the internet using DDoS to push individuals and groups towards centralized solutions like cloudflare.  It will happen with bitcoin too using what you call spam.  Since spam can be issued anonymously, it will be issued anonymously if it is found to change behavior in a way that is desired.

The problem with community driven moderation is that the community can be gamed.  One person can vote multiple times, so the more resources you have the more voice you have.  What you propose only works when there is a barrier to entry that ensures that each person can only have a single voice and a single vote.  Without that, community moderation doesn't work and special interests are able to take control.

Ethereum is a really impressive effort and I'm excited that 21 has the potential to bring that to the bitcoin protocol.  The thing that will hurt ethereum in the long run is their open source commitment to development.  If the 21.co stack is really robust enough, it should be easy to port over ethereum code and concepts to this platform.  Furthermore, I don't expect 21inc to be completely open source and this could help them in the long run by making it harder to see improvements to ideas and code that came from ethereum to be ported back to ethereum.  21.co is in a position to enjoy the best of both open and closed development.  They can open just enough to engender trust in the system and encourage contributors while not compromising some code.  If they can make contracts private, that is another huge advantage as you cannot run a private contract on ethereum.  I expect APIs that extend 21.co to ethereum to happen really quickly.

It is for developers, not consumers trying to make a profit.  If you took the time to learn about the product on the 21.co website and tuned into their "learning" section, you would see that there are 3 types of payment rails with the third not yet offered.  One of those rails is 21 device to 21 device in which you can do off-chain transactions and send as little as a satoshi, so no fees.  Again, this is a playground for devs, not consumers.

There is a point where it is not good business sense to do something and thus business people won't do it until it makes sense.

Intent has nothing to do with it.  Capacity is everything.  Cryptocurrencies have the capacity to hire armies comprised of anonymous people all over the world.

I actually love the IPv4 example because it is an excellent example of how we collectively adapt to make something work by working around its short comings.

I was pointing out how a certain group of people has a tendency to latch onto anything no matter how relevant to today's discussions.  It's almost like they're trolling...

I think the price is one of the most interesting aspects of bitcoin.  Bitcoin would be nothing without it and its potential to grow.  It is the main attraction for most adopters and it is what has made people take the time to learn more about bitcoin.

For now it appears to be.  But does anyone seriously bank on it remaining that way?  Companies like 21 have the potential to not only take control but do it in a for-the-people manner.  Meaning they could take control via mining majority but implement systems that allow it to still be driven by community consensus.  Except they might find themselves in a position to actually be able to build consensus in a distributed way, maybe even decentralize on another layer!  Something like that would probably lead to a superior form of governance.

It's going to happen one way or another without changes to how reddit works.  They can't be totally hands off or special interests will game their point of view to the top.  If they are too strict then you get blowback like you mention, so they have to find a middle ground and as best I can tell, that's what they're trying to do.

That's true, but 21 inc has the potential to leverage its distributed nature to add value in this area.  There is a high barrier to entry to deconstruct\replicate what they are doing and if it catches on, that could be their killer app at a basic level.

I expect everyone to lose their minds in the coming months.  If you look at everything that is going on right now, we are headed for very exciting times.  The price has been steady while people are stressing the network and new companies like 21inc could bring huge added value if they really do enable smart contracts and autonomous corporations using bitcoins blockchain.  The Winklevii have an ETF coming and Wall Street has taken serious interest in bitcoin and blockchain technologies, and then the halving.

From the same people(buttcoiners) that bring you "bitcoin has less than a million users, no one is using it" comes "bitcoin breaks with hundreds of millions of users".
Should I worry about stagnating adoption based on no proof at all because there isn't an aggregate large enough to decide or a threat to bitcoin based on its capacity that we aren't near reaching?

From what I understand this is not true based on evidence of Hearn trying to appeal to miners by choosing the number 8 as the blocksize.  By doing this he specifically said that they count and "I'm going to write my code in a way that they will accept it".  This didn't work in retrospect.
@_date: 2015-10-28 23:41:42


  
Following your logic, no startup would ever get funded because it isn't profitable to do it.  In reality risks are weighed and taken all the time.  This isn't a binary scenario with two possibilities.  Miners will make different decisions for different reasons and this experiment will continue.

I don't think microtransactions need to be happening on the bitcoin blockchain, they can settle on it, but companies like ChangeTip enable instant micro transactions while not bloating the blockchain.  I'm all for promoting a healthy third party ecosystem enabling features on top of the bitcoin blockchain in an effort to keep bitcoins protocol simple and by virtue of its simplicity harder to attack.

Jamie knows bitcoin isn't going to be stopped by the government and he knows it's not going anywhere, **he is not a fool**.  Given this and considering he said this at the height of a bubble that gets people excited, you have to assume his goal is to slow it down.  Like everyone else who is informed about bitcoin, he has to know that we are on a schedule for release and there will never be another time like this to pick up coins while there is still a lot of them in circulation and new ones being created every day.  Don't for a second dismiss his actions as ignorance, he certainly is not an ignorant person.

This is true, but they have to prove that the person actively avoided it.  If they just don't sell that much at once, they are in the lead.  It's important to break it up into smaller transactions of different sizes cashed out over a longer period of time.  Basically, don't create a pattern that is easily identified.

Since you're new to ether, you probably haven't figured out that everything ethereum was built to do is being ported to services that will run on the bitcoin blockchain thus making ethereum irrelevant.  Ethereum is an awesome project that raised the bar for everyone, but it would be delusional to believe it won't be copied to services run on the bitcoin blockchain.  Anything innovative they can come up with will be copied to other projects because ethereum is open source.
