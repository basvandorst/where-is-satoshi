It's too expensive. Why buy into it today when it will be worth less tomorrow? Why buy things with it today when it will be worth more tomorrow? You have to be a professional market trader to make sound purchasing decisions with it.

It was going to take way too long to get the 1 ETH I bought last year. I ended up using a website which allowed me to import my private key and send the ETH to my Coinbase wallet. This left a sour taste in mouth. I doubt I'll ever use Ethereum again.

Why does the status quo require an altcoin? It doesn't. Sidechains would no doubt be run by centralized entities. This isn't rocket science.
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:58:40
Why? Gold is pretty much useless outside of tech manufacturing. It's dense, and therefore heavy, so you can't carry it around. You can't easily break gold into tinier pieces at a fraction the society's people have mutually agreed upon taking as payment either.

Because current sidechains require central authentication. Cambridge Blockchain (an example of what sidechains may become) require you send them a copy of your state ID before you're granted chain access. There is no reason to believe future sidechains won't behave as current altchains already do.

Pray tell. How does one generate addresses with which the rest of the Bitcoin blockchain can confirm ownership without even a generating a single private key? 
The reason you are able to receive funds on Coinbase and the reason they are *your* (or Coinbase's in this case) coins is because there is a private key associated with that address. You wouldn't be able to spend coins from your addresses without first having ownership of the corresponding private key. The longer you talk, the more assured I am of your complete ignorance to the very nature of Bitcoin.
It is very possible that Coinbase has exactly one wallet. But as far as the term "wallet" refers to a collection of addresses (wallet.dat), and it does, it is also just as likely that each account has one wallet. Nothing you have said has made any sense and I'm beginning to think you're just a stupid troll.

It is not commonplace to use those terms interchangeably and you are the only one I have ever come across who has tried to do so. Coinbase never generates more than one wallet per account. Claiming the opposite is false and misleading to those who may be new to Bitcoin. Your claim that Coinbase has no wallet is also false.
@_date: 2014-11-30 16:56:18

1. I stated in the OP that I'm acting as his guard essentially. He got jumped, robbed, and now he wants to try this. I can get gift cards for him once he has enough money and I can send him the gift card codes. In the end though, he's managing his money and I taught him how to get new addresses, send BTC, and check his wallet balance. He'll send me his BTC when he wants something (like a Burger King card) and I'll text him the gift card code. Most places won't accept raw data for Visa gift cards so this will have to do.
2. He can get a new one. His BTC is safe.
3. Because I don't have actual money. I'm a jobless student. I asked him what he needed and he said "just a pair of longjohns". I was able to get a family member of mine to lend me $155 for his bus ticket.
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:14:25
I actually never thought this. Maybe it's because I knew about the blockchain before Blockchain.info was a thing. But, I honestly can't remember a time before Blockchain.info. I think I just assumed the site was using a commonly-understood word within the Bitcoin community to identify itself with Bitcoin.

I just want to tag along to this comment too add something that I witnessed on I picked up a hitch-hiker either last year or the year before (my sense of time is terrible). This young kid mentioned getting beat and having all of his money taken so I talked to him about getting a Coinbase account he could access from his phone (he had an uncle or something paying for cell minutes apparently). I ended up getting him a Greyhound ticket to his destination (Miami) and made a post on about it. I thought it would be the perfect time for the subreddit to make good on the promise of Bitcoin. If I could get just a few people to donate to this young guy's Bitcoin wallet, he could check his balance and do all the things you can do via SMS. I told him about Gyft and also that if he'd prefer, I could buy him stuff on his behalf.
99% of the replies to that thread were accusing me of being a scammer. It was really disappointing. To me, it felt like the greedy types were finding reasons to back out of something everyone previously agreed was a great idea: Homeless people making use of Bitcoin to prevent theft.

This talk seems to get a lot wrong about why Bitcoin is valuable. Daniel says multiple times that Bitcoins aren't rare because they are "infinitely reproducible" and you can always mine more. I'm pretty sure there will only be 21 million BTC mined. No idea what this guy is talking about.

Accidental. The US never actually armed the Free Syrian Army. The CIA was going to give them telecoms, but backed out last minute. So, not even by proxy has ISIL been given US arms during the war.

I'm willing to concede to that scenario. But in no way do I believe Bitcoin will ever be valued at anything less than $200 for more than a day. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:50:06
I really don't understand Coinkite's business model. When I first signed up, I felt like I was using a bank, which felt dirty considering the true nature of Bitcoin. Then I saw they had these debit cards that I could only get if I paid for a Standard account at $120 /year. I wondered why I needed to pay them for the ability to use the card when they take a percentage of every transaction I make with my balance. Seems like I'm being fucked from both ends so to speak. Also, they don't seem to have a fixed CAD/USD price for their terminal. They only occasionally change the BTC price to attempt to keep up with changing BTC prices. 
The whole company idea is ridiculous in my opinion and I don't see it going anywhere unless some major changes are made.

With all due respect, the Dark Wallet team is not developing for Microsoft, directly or indirectly. The team is developing for the end user, taking browser support into consideration. The sentence including the word "Microsoft" above frowns upon Microsoft's support for the centralization of online trade. We see Bitcoin as a means for decentralization and liberation from the accepted monopolies that credit card companies and governments hold. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:41:25
Yes, it's definitely a viable alternative to credit cards. But if the author sees Bitcoin as an insured company ready to call you relentlessly until you make good on your debts, he's delusional.
