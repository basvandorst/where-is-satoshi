Well like not every thing you buy day to day is a necessity, I know a person who gave up cigs and is buying BTC with all that money he would've saved at the end of the month 
This is incredible, both healthy and shit he has more BTC than Me

Gotta recall what happened before that crash, mt gox was shut down,few people got arrested for money laundering and whatever else happened was deemed illegal. When Bitcoin has decentralized exchanges that'll change the dynamics of a crash greatly, doesn't mean it can't happen but it won't be as detrimental

I'd pay at cost now as well, and sell what you couldn't afford after the Seg2x fork

Haha shit, yeah. Still I guess all I'm trying to say is. Buy The dips! And I guess picking up a knife could be a really good idea if there's a murderer in the house

Haha yeah Jamie would be the killer! It's kinda fucked how one guy calls it a fraud and the whole community memes him. 
And the thing is Bitcoin has dropped a lot in a short period of time. not for no reason (mt gox and money laundering arrests) but the first bear market we saw in 2014 to 2015 I think it from like $1400 to $200 
Point being, Bitcoin is alive today still

if fundamentals don't change, BTC has value

This "FUD" isn't changing the markets at all!!! Does anybody understand that this is a natural pullback? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:43:18
Although I understand the Top 10 Cryptos now will change a lot in the coming years. Bitcoin, I Believe is here to stay for a very long time. Its the Brand Name that will survive. One of the Upcoming Forks (Gold, 2x, or another one) will keep Bitcoin alive and upgraded in some shape or form
