They will still let you use money from checking/savings accounts. (As of January)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:00:39
Oh I definitely agree. If I didn't need a bank to hold my money anymore I would already be out, but sadly that is not the case

Actual shutdowns, sure, 4. But the threat of shutdown, and then passing temporary spending bills to keep shit going for a while until they get a real budget passed, that's pretty much every year

You have more than 1? Good job

I just watched it go to 19.5 then back to 14.5 in like 10 minutes. Good luck trying to time these things. 
Best part is GDAX went down, and now that it's back up, it's pretending the over 19 didn't even happen. If you look now, it has the high at 17,739

Ouch, that's even painful to read, poor guy.  Hopefully he gets back in soon, shit ain't stopping going up

It's about to break 16k on coinbase right now...
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:47:27
I'll make an ICO for that, brb.

Maybe they shouldn't be passing tax plans that create trillions in debt if tax revenue is really that important...
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:34:06
But what about exchanges where it never goes back to fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:06:08
Well that's bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:39:48
That's what I said with BTC at $3000
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:35:28
Can one really make a decent profit off of this? Versus doing it yourself?

I use CapitalOne and I haven't had any issues with them yet, I guess that's a new policy...

Websites that give free coins out, usually after you complete a captcha or an offer. No games required, but usually a coinpot or faucethub account is needed

Why not get in now at $7k before it hits $100k?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:42:50
I'm sure they've heard of it. But having lived right next door (Frisco,TX) I can assure you, the majority are old money wealthy. Sons and daughters of people who made fortunes on oil/land in dallas/ft. worth trying to escape the city. Not the type of people to be getting in on the ground floor of any tech

If you can man, delete this post entirely, not just the comment. I can still read it while the rest of the post loads

Faucets man. Use the faucets. I got that much in the past month from a couple of them, plus leaving an add or two running on repeat when I'm gone during the day. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:07:43
1k doesn't sound like much, but let's say 1btc hits $200,000. That's now $25.6k. And people think it will get higher. 
You can also use faucets and online offers to get some sats. 
Now they don't sound like much, maybe 250sat for clicking through a online slideshow. But let's use that $200k figure. That's 0.2 cents per sat. 
That means that 250sat is now $0.5

I wish I could attend, but sadly I don't have $200k for a fucking deposit to participate in a auction!! Such bullshit

Pretty much l. After the split, you will either have the new coin in your wallet, or use your private key on a different one that supports the coin and you will have it

@_date: 2017-09-30 17:17:20
You do receive 1:1 after the fork, but put your BTC in a wallet you have the private key for, so not Coinbase. Once you receive the coins, you can trade/spend them independently of the original coin. But they are not worth the same. BTCH got pumped to about 980 on HitBTC, now it's settling around 500. So not doubling your stack, but not a bad addition if you do sell 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:34:05
If it drops, goes back up, and drops again, do you buy? Or only each 10% drop below your starting price once
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:36:16
Hell they had faucets giving out up to 5 btc at one point. I kick my self everyday for not sticking with it back then 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:27:43
Already done lol

Remind me again why that's bad?

15 hours sounds slow, but if I own a store and replace the credit card terminal with BTC, that's now 15 hours for me to get my money vs. 72 hours with the cc
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:01:11
Okay, that's terrible 
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:00:38
Neither. Now I'm no expert, but it's more like having a debit card(public key) that everyone can see and follow transactions, and the actual bank account number (private key). The password is like a pin number for the debit card and the 12 word phrase is more like account recovery information for the bank account. 
When you use a wallet where you own the private key you own it all. Unlike an exchange or hybrid exchange/wallet like coinbase phone  app, where they hold the private keys and you just have the debit card to access those funds.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:49:23
From what I understand, if you own the private key, then yes. You will get the new coin when it splits
