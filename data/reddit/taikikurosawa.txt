I get your point. 
May I ask you how you buy the bitcoins without providing your bank account ID etc.? 
@_date: 2014-01-26 00:39:07
Forget a link to blockchain...

Good site too, but again only Steam Games. Is there a pendant for EA Games?
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:04:16
I already have most of the games from Humble Bundle or are not interested. But thanks anyway.

I think it means that if you buy some Bitcoins for x$ you then want to sell those coins with x% of profit.  
But that's just how I interpret these boxes. And I'm also new to trading.

I'm pretty sure that I downloaded it from multibit.org 
And I didn't started a scan now. I just went straight to bed. Maybe everything was just a bad dream. 
But nope. It wasn't...

Looks like a scam... Anyway not what I was searching for.

Good site, but only Steam Games. What about EA Games?

What would be the methods to protect my wallet?  
Actually I tried Linux once, but I didn't even managed to install Skype...  
I own a Mac, would that be a possibility?  
The file was in "CryptocoinTrader.exe", actually that was a fake Version of QT Bitcoin Trader... I found it at reddit, the download was on sourceforge.

I downloaded it from multibit.org 
The satoshi and the 0.335 were from the same person. You can check it out on the blockchain link I posted in a comment. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 11:39:50
Okay. I think I'll give it another try. 
When I once used it Skype wasn't in this App Store. Instead I had to use the command line to get it, but that somehow didn't worked... 
What distribution would you suggest? 
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:15:28
Yeah. Found that out too... 
so it appears that I had a virus. Which wasn't detected by Avast. Why isn't there function to use a password for transactions...? :/
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:14:15
I think so. I used the built in password function of multibit for the wallet and for the backup...
