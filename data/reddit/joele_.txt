For major upgrade, top miners will upgrade to the latest version, because these miners are making big money in mining so they are protecting the bitcoin network, any updates that will help, protect, fix, improve the network they will follow, and those miners that did not follow will not find or solve any block unless they upgrade as well.
These are the top miners

"A monetary/payment system that relies on gold backing is reliant on the backer. It relies on a centralized, trusted party, to warehouse the gold and provide convertibility. This is the counter-party risk eliminated by Bitcoin.

There is allocated space for tx with 0 fee in the block, the more older your coin the more chances of getting included in this space.
Because your coin is not old enough so other tx with 0 fee are filling this space. 
While hours passes, your coin will become older, eventually your coin will be added then, otherwise the tx will fail and your coin will be returned back to you.

For me brainwallet is the most secure way to store your bitcoin.
Think of words that are personal to you that you can easily remember it, example, all firstname of your family + pet name + your street name + your first domain name, use symbol and/or numbers instead of space.
Alternate lower and uppercase per letter or by words.
Once you decided your passphrase, test it 50 times by typing it so you will clearly remember it.

50 characters only 1 billion possibilities?, hackers should easily hack bitcoin then. Hackers doesn't know you are using names, and other names are sometimes unique plus replaced space with symbols and added case strategy, you are looking at 2^256 same as private key here.
Easily remember by you but same as private key difficulty to hackers.
Your sample is probable if you list the name of your family names in order and tell the hackers that this is your brainwallet passphrase but with added chars then your estimate might be possible.
Those users that had been hacked using brain wallet were using titles, common quote, and sentences,  so it does not need a skilled hackers to crack these.
