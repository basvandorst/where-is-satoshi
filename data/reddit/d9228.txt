Just a bunch of coin joins?

I don't know how to react to this. Is there a word stronger than shitpost?

I guess I learned it watching Jim Cramer, where the cut scenes illustrate the animals.

On what planet is bitcoin a bank?

Looks like LA

No way. Runs counter to the antifragile ideology of bitcoin. Only reason to hardfork is to swap out algorithms for quantum resistance to combat 51% attack.

Didn't he go down for trying to have someone killed?
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:19:01
There is no "original bitcoin", especially not a hard-forked chain. He probably brings it up because if ASIC-resistance was valued, BTG wouldn't be worthless and getting 51% attacked.

I disagree. Do you know how credit cards and the banking system work? Chip encryption, signature verification, settlement, SWIFT, fiat currency, fractional reserve banking? It just needs to work.
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:03:02
Any resources for where to start?
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:36:18
You actually don't need that many nodes. The important part is that everyone CAN run a full node; not necessarily that everyone does. 10,000 active is plenty for a given point in time.
Edit: Talking about propagating nodes. Nodes that don't allow incoming connections can still verify transactions and are not counted here.
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:01:21
I don't necessarily disagree with the other response either, but I just meant that the fork would inevitably be contentious, leaving "bitcoin original" and "bitcoin asic-resistant", which would then compete for legitimacy just as BCH and the others do.

What if it's $100 billion? Where is this number coming from?
@_date: 2018-07-17 02:59:00
Used to check the price a lot. Now it doesn't really change that much. I got bored of it and now I check maybe once a day, just saw it was up today about 10 minutes ago.

I've watched dozens of his interviews over the years and they still blow my mind. No one else I've seen comes close to this level of articulation when it comes to the future of crypto.

And what does each halving represent? A halving of the inflation rate, which is currently at 4℅. Historic USD inflation is more like 2%. What is your picture trying to say?

Mining centralization isn't ideal, but the problem won't be solved by hard-forking the protocol.

Saving you a click: It's the Samsung retailer in the Baltic states that's accepting crypto, not Samsung itself.

I think we have a lot of smart people to convince of its viability before we face the dumb dumbs.

That's not how any of this works. I hope this post is a joke.

It's not a legit coinbase competitor because it isn't an exchange at all.

If you paid $6 last week you got screwed. I recommend Samourai wallet, which has been letting me get by with 1 sat/byte. Shouldn't be more than $0.25 these days, if that.

Shitpost. How do you figure bitcoin is note scarce than diamonds?
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:15:17
Sounds like 7 tx/sec would grow to maybe 28.

Awful article. Is this upgrade possible with a soft fork?
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:13:06
Current (and past) Bitcoin inflation rate is way more than USD.
The increase in bitcoin price over the past few years has nothing to do with deflation.
You idiot.

Care to elaborate on what Finney did for the network? I don't know the story.
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:48:49
Yeah I trust the combination of my wallet provider and people who audit the code. I also trust the combination of the protocol devs and people who audit that code. 
The difference between this and banks is that you have these people outside the institutions that can audit the code.

Works like gold. Sell to an exchange or individual, or trade it (use it as currency) to buy goods or services. But yes, exchanges will let you transfer the money to your bank account if you choose to sell there.
