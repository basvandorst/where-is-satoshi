what? universal healthcare kills? might want to ask every other developed nation about that cause uhhh it doesnt
whereas we have 45,000 people dying every year directly as a result of lack of healthcare insurance coverage. most likely way more than that as the study that covered that statistic did not take a lot of different social contexts into account.

cause that's a realistic thing to imagine lol
that totally wouldn't cause massive riots or anything
we have the money. we may not be using the money in the wisest way right now, but we have the money. not to mention that tax raises for the absurdly rich and corporations could help a lot.

uhhh would rather have nationalized health care than have to be in debt for the rest of my life because my body decided to go and get cancer or some shit ya
nationalized health care has worked pretty much everywhere it exists *and* is much more cost efficient

you could say the same to those people who hoard immense amounts of wealth by extracting value from their workers' labor, and only giving them a certain portion of that value back to them.
way i see it, it's just giving back to the people.

so what is this objective human nature that you're talking about?
whats the objective human nature that can be found between all different kinds of societies and organizations of humans?
because there is none, other than the fact that our nature is defined by our environment.
no one said anything about living in perfect harmony but claiming that the profit incentive is the only incentive which exists is dead wrong.

yes! top notch fellow redditor! i also think people’s value as human beings and whether they deserve to live is directly correlated to whether they can contribute to our economy. 
kill the poor! kill the poor! etc!
resources are finite but goddamn yall are heartless *and* stupid if you think that *medical care* is that finite. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:58:51
is this the only argument you can come up with or what
stefan molyneux could do better tbh thats not saying much

for context - think less about “state imposed labor hours” or something, and think more akin to when Castro wanted Cubans to try to expand their agriculture
as much as i disagree that Cuba is communist, and as much as i disagree with Castro as a leader, there was one moment that really inspired hope in me for what communism *could* be. basically the idea was that Castro wanted to expand the agricultural situation of Cubans so that all could benefit from it. 
to achieve this, all Castro did was give an empowering speech urging Cubans to try to dedicate just a few hours a week to growing sugarcane crops. no state imposed labor, no laws, just a request. he put out guidelines for how to successfully grow the crops, when to harvest, how to harvest, etc. 
as a result of this, the sugar exports of Cuba *exploded*
i cant find the speech sadly (though ive found a few speeches of his acknowledging this event) but if i find it ill let you knw

communist philosophy isnt that everyone takes the same effort, its that everyone contributes socially what he or she can in terms of socially necessary labor, and what that means is different per society. i may mean that your community wants people to try to do an hour or 2 of gardening per week, might mean something completely different. in return for everyone contributing to socially necessary labor, we all benefit and have more time to do what we actually want rather than spending 2 hours being productive at a job and then 7 other hours just generating wealth for your boss. 
its the same idea behind a tax pool, except we cut out the middleman and get rid of money and just have a labor pool. much more efficient and much more beneficial imo.

healthcare isnt a commodity

fun to watch tbh. can't wait for the return to normal phase and then the inevitable tank right after.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:59:11
hah, sorry, force of habit i guess

and they should pay even more than they currently do.

you mean former resident of the state that completely stopped being even somewhat communist around 1921?
read some Marx. the USSR post-1921 is not what communism is. neither was the USSR pre-1921, but it at least seemed to be going in a direction that could have turned positive. by the time that you were alive in what could be called the USSR, it was as capitalist as could be in all but name and propaganda.
now, you're obviously heated and i have no intentions of defending the actions of a dumb state capitalist state that liked to wave red flags and sing the internationale. i'll just leave this off with the fact that i probably hate the USSR more than you do, my guy.
if you're genuinely curious why i call the USSR state capitalism and not communism you can ask, because i do have an answer. political theory means that terms like "capitalism" and "communism" have set definitions and are more than just "if a state calls itself communist, its communist". otherwise we should be saying that democracy is a failed experiment just because North Korea exists.
