[Here]( is a screenshot of the selling option. If I can't sell bitcoins through Blockchain then what is this, and why does it ask for my bank account number and show me how much I get from them if I can't sell them through it? It was pending, then expired when I tried to sell.

1. What? I don't understand.
2. What again? I have no clue.
The coins are in blockchain(dot)com (not info). The sale is currently pending (Itried again before your reply, I believe it's going to expire again). I simply tried to copy and paste the wallet address to the blockchain FROM LBC that started with the 3, and it didn't work. I have no clue what public and private keys are and I never used them. I don't see "non-spendable" anywhere.

I tried selling the coin locally unpeeled but no one wanted it so I thought it would be easier to sell online. My LBC wallet starts with a 3. I'm trying to sell them straight through Blockchain but the transaction keeps "expiring" and I keep losin BTC because of all the damn fees. Soon I'll have nothing left, they're all gone to fees. What can I do? How do I sell them? I need yet another wallet? Seriously it takes 3 or more wallets to sell them? Sure, I can transfer them to electrum and pay AGAIN for it and risk it being expired too. God damnit why is this so hard!?

I have peeled it already, but now I'm struggling to get it moved to somewhere where I can sell it. I loaded it to Blockchain and then made another wallet to LocalBitcoins, where I'm trying to send it so I can sell it, but it won't go there. It keeps saying the wallet address is incorrect, even thoug it isn't.

THANK YOU ALL FOR HELPING.
My second attempt to sell them through blockchain worked, and I have received the money on my bank account.
Thank you again!
