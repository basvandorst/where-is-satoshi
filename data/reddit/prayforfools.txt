a professional investor would come to btc to make a larger buck. 
not because he believes in or understands the idea of bitcoin. 
so he can eat the shit crumbles out of my pants and go back to wallstreet.

@_date: 2017-01-02 06:55:05

@_date: 2015-09-12 15:47:56
dat cancer must be killing you dude
without the average joe btc will be nothing. but thats too farfetched for u to grasp
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:31:37
its in the fuking newspaper
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:31:09
you miss the point, fool. shes an average person reading this on the newspaper. this is what the majority of people are thinking.
i feel sorry for your pitiful comment.
@_date: 2016-10-02 13:02:34
we just mined 1.986580 thousand coins
ok joke aside this could potentially be a heavy hit for all cryptos. the average joe doesnt know whats onecoin and bitcoin - they are one and the same to him. once this pyramid collapses it will hurt all other cryptos' reputation
**DONT U GET THIS?**
@_date: 2016-10-01 22:58:35
wow i thought the ceo monster is hilarious, but...
