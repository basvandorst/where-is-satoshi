to have more coins is better than having less, also from a censorship perspective
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:28:55


How is this not the same as ETH fork ?  
Regardless, any blockchain can be forked at any time, and that's like the whole point of it. If the market decides for something else, then it's free to do so. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:02:30
I know, and ETH is used a lot for decentralized exchanges...
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:33:55
when we have higher highs and higher lows, then we can talk about price not going down. Look at the weekly candles
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:24:53
That's not the summary at all actually.
Just read point 3


@_date: 2018-01-14 01:29:10
So the network is being used? What is the problem ?
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:24:51


Great, show me the Rootstock decentralised exchange then
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:31:17
Since scaling up support is not a money problem, no...
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:08:43
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:58:41
Still not arguing about specifics, just pointing out that secure and slow don't correlate
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:47:11
Not necessarily, in parallell 2nd layer solutions are built
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:03:16
Why would they if BTC is not a "real currency" ?
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:02:33
that's not what I meant at all, I was just making an example of something that is secure but not slow. Simple pin codes with X attempt failure is another thing that is quite secure but easy to implement and handle
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:50:40
You forgot the part when you place a massive short 1 hour before the article launches
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:12:10
not at all as long as you keep your risk levels. Using BTC as collateral for small margin trades following the general trend is a quite good strategy if you know how to execute it
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:26:25


This might come as a surprise to you, but not everyone on reddit is from US :O
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:46:13


Since ETH is not meant for cash/money usage such as BTC or LTC; this is not so much of a problem
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:36:34
Well the altcoins comes in waves. People will always be scammed or looking to put money into the "next thing"
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:28:42
Yes, and that is a good thing. What would the other option be, a lot of users using something they don't like ?  Free markets chose which software they run
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:32:18


Well, so can BTC too. That's the beauty of free markets and open source
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:53:01
Good, I read the rest of your post after i quoted that, and I agree with you :&gt;
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:48:27
I would say both have scaling problems right now but BTC and LTC is a bit ahead with LN finally coming after 3 years, but one can also compare it to the life time of the projects and the things needed to be solved before.
Anyhow, most big cryptos have a promising future and this is what is interesting
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:58:01
why can't they just clone the code? That's what they did at first right?
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:10:53
So you think all companies are blockchain agnostic and has no vested interest in ETH or NEO?  The code can just be moved in an instant? 
How to justify this actually from a business perspective ? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:57:29
Exactly, this shows the point about market is irrational and can be for a long time
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:48:04






That this is false advice and you can not forsee all kind of black swan events, competition and so on in the future
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:46:45
Did you watch the TRON pump? They stole whitepaper from others I don't remember, don't have a product at ALL and so on. Still is up like 30x
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:56:02
Since code is around 5% importance of a software project, this doesn't matter so much. So RSK is also having Solidity then?
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:34:52
"Will do" is not the same as "can do". Also focusing on tech in software is a noob mistake, you neet RSK to compete with devs learning ETH code and infrastructure for 3 years for example
Why are there so many projects in PHP and Java and not Haskell or Rust ?
Also don't forget PR/brand association. Bitcoin is not the enterprise grade solution, it's more the libertarian cash philosophy tech. NEO is tailoring itself to be the "smart contract for chinese enterprise" blockchain for example, so a lot of companies will invest into that
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:31:14
so there is no one accepting the PRs into this project or what ?
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:53:38
well the amount you move never has something to do with the cost of it, so i don't get this argument 
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:23:35


And? Welcome to free markets
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:20:54
Yes, from the perspective of the community using it. Also one is for payments the other for running distributed software so one needs to be more conservative 
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:36:23
Well I thought without referring to a specific timeframe, the current trend towards and from ATH was implied. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:25:05
No it was one concern I had, why do you make my quotes in a way I did not say them? 
But OK, let's look at it from the other side. Let's say you are DigixDAO  , one of the oldest smart contract projects. What are the incentives to switch to RSK from tomorrow on, even if you can just copy paste the code ?
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:51:26
No that we are in a one month downtrend, and that you are using arbitrary timeframes without stating them first
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:25:20
Typical bitcoin/crypto technology viewpoint. The people involved in the big cryptos and their lack of market psychology and behaviour economics will make them miss a lot of the upcoming market movements
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:47:31
well is not the real problem not batching txes ?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:49:07






So what? That's what risk/reward is for.  No one is trading thinking it's "full proof", they are looking for the best probable trades during a timeframe they chose.. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:20:39


What do you mean ? The fees are lower because the fees are lower... ?
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:53:36
You put too much faith and technical understanding in the crypto normie :P
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:24:31
You are aware that also BTC has forked in it's history? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:23:07
That's why you never tell anyone about your real holdings
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:13:11
I pay like 80 cent for sepa transactions regardless of amount too
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:19:18
I think everything will just go up more, including BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:37:27
So they did not ban it for the 40th time for real? Wooooooooow 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:50:50
yes Roger is everywhere when there is things that don't benefite bitcoin for sure
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:35:16
Depends as I said 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:09:32
not everything, and the learning was not even my main point but how the business is setup was.
What I actually think though is that doing stuff or BOTH chains will be a good decision, you never want to be exposed to 100% of something.
And regarding "immutable hurr durr" meme take a look at Bitcoin and it's forks and how old Bitcoin was when those happened (:
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:26:59
lol, learn about trend reversal
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:02:49
In theory yes, in reality no
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:33:30
There is a looot of space between day trading and holding. You can trade weekly moving averages with 3% of your portfolio, for example
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:33:55
Sure, but this does not counter my argument. You and me are in a crypto tech knowledge bubble, but that doesn't influence the average market buyer
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:50:45


Not really, but the network that secures something does. SHA-256 is a very secure algorithm, but it is at the same time very fast to compute. Other way around would be that a slow algorith == more secure
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:19:44


Referring to hard fork 2016? Check out how many times bitcoin has forked...
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:22:47
You are underestimating the amount of people who want to buy "The next bitcoin below 1$"
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:26:20
Usually the volatility of crypto scales with it's market cap, bigger ones having less, so that's not so strange
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:29:24
But still, it's a fact both forked within the first years of their existence, regardless of thinking what they should have learned and not
No i did not
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:18:48
This is like saying AngularJS is a jquery clone with better framework support. It's true, but so what? it's an improvement
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:54:46
of course, this space is so new so anyone holding 100% of their crypto in one asset is quite stupid
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:45:24
With the gains those coins have been seeing, I wonder why spending 50-100$ on a 1TB disk is such a big deal....
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:29:58
BTC was 18 months when this happened, ETH was 12 or 13 months old when it hard forked 2016. So roughly the same age and beginning of project
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:35:56
well you are here, 1M normies are not. already one degree of separation in knowledge there...
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:53:57
Just DO IT! 
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:59:17
What I believe doesn't matter since no one can force it anyway and all nodes in a network can fork at any time 
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:41:13
And what does even "invest in technology" means? Investing in itself is the act of buying something know you think has more value for the future. If you just like people who code bitcoin or any other crypto, just transfer money to them using paypal...
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:02:02
Listributed apps ?
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:55:06
Lol no need to be rude. The argument was fork or not, that's what I countered 
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:45:08
storage and bandwith is cheaper than ever, I don't see how this will be a problem, especially with BTCs continius price increase and storage solutions like Siacoin upcoming
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:47:36
Everything depends on your timeframe. If you want to hold for a long time, now is probably quite a good time to buy
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:47:08
You are avoding my point. The current mid term trend is downwards with slight consolidation in 13-14k range, on the long term it's up. That you do this just reinforces my argument
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:51:33
The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvet, as the saying goes. I don't get this argument
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:28:42
just satoshi and a few friends mining on CPU but yeah
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:47:33
but is not the point here "why bitcoin"? Myself I like open source and blockchains, but I could not care less if Bitcoin, Ethereum, DOGE or something else made the best ones for it's use cases. Being attached to something because it was first is stupid
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:17:24
not replaced but more things are created in parallell
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:23:07
 oops 
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:57:27
Just look at ETH, 2.5 years after it was released there are maybe 10 real dApps apart from all ICO raising platforms. And there is 100s of ETH developers, how many is dong RSK stuff? 
Things in this new space are sloooow
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:20:18
eh... I must be tired from redditing too much. I misread you and thought you meant "transaction speed" for whatever stupid reason.
Sorry for the confusion, you are completly right and fees are good and makes the network stronger and harder for an attacker yes!
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:26:31
the charts never lie
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:48:30
Exactly, so they jump to the next, and next 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:51:43
sure, but to who ? Why spend 2$ dollar and "steal" it from a shop you regulary visit?
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:15:42
Of course it can, history has proven otherwise. Every dominating software have and will be replaced.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:26:31
bear market taking its toll on you? lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:01:44
well I would say it's two things at the SAME TIME :D Fork of the code, split of the chain
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:33:15
sure, check out this  
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:10:29
But RSK is  made for dapps... so what's your point ?
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:54:02
This is one of the most stupid headlines I have read here. by definition, trading is NOT for losers since if you trade futures, there is a winner for every losing trande, and the other way around.
This had nothing to do with "whales"; this was just stupid bankroll management.
It's fine if you wanna stay out of trading, but don't try to put a label on it that it's not
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:41:44
But it's never bad to diversify. You never know with BTC compared to vanguard ETFs
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:45:44
You know that you can still have theories based on trends and probabilites , and still have BTC for a lot of reasons right ?
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:45:12
So has RootStock replaced ETH yet like it was said over 1 year ago ? :D
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:51:09
yes, so?  This has nothing to do with my explanation, losing in trading is normal, the important part is that winners should be bigger than losers
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:18:28
Or they 
stagnate because they are too big and move slowly
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:24:13
Yes, good :)
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:41:51
if you talk about something without giving the context,  it's hard to know if you talk about one week or one year
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:58:57
Sure, I think if BTC find a good support at 13.5k(not going below in one week), and then works its way up above 15.8k and close above in some days we are going to 20k
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:38:34
not every but a huge part is, just changing the inflation, blocksize and so on a bit
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:07:49
everything has a potential upside of 100x, this doesn't mean you blindly should buy it and never sell
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:43:31
Now it's been sideways for almost a year though
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:42:59
This could be one of the worst posts about a market ever, it assumes losses are measured in good or bad and not amount
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:00:01
lets say I short 13k with 100 worth
I now exit 98$ dollar of that, having a 2$ position "just because". I might then get liquidated at 16k, but I still risked only 2$
@_date: 2019-07-17 07:28:53
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:56:25
I do not care about those ratings, I see them as payed marketing 
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:28:34
yes, and if 1 ETH = 1 yacht they would be even higher... but that's not the case so what's the argument
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:01:32
Ok, I get the reasoning behind but for any trader or investor that knows about market psychology and risk I don't think they will do it.  It's like you could speculate in Bitconnect thinking you will make it out in time, and still know that it's a ponzi
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:12:50
no, the prophecy doesn't specify a lower point
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:40:46
same for a bull market
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:44:40


You could also lose everything, like with all investments. What's your point
@_date: 2019-07-17 07:30:27
The prophecy doesn't say 9200 is the bottom
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:45:26
One mans ceiling is another mans floor
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:08:16

The charts never lie
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:29:48
Oh I thought it was for using, you know transfer of money and so on
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:14:11

Women are biologically less risk taking than men, and bitcoin and crypto currencies has been (and still are) very risky from an investment, tech career and regulartory perspective
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:02:24
ok, but it doesn't mean "people get rekt"
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:28:44
Of course it varies for individuals, but on average it's affected by hormones 


@_date: 2017-12-20 11:11:48
But everyone can create a fork, what decides when it's a important one or not? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:51:05
Never left it! :O :D
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:41:55
Yes that's the key, know when to walk aeay
Good i could help 
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:13:09
no one said otherwise
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:48:58
ok, so anything that there is a market for +
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:02:19
So just like bitcoin mining? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:56:27
You and me can also fork, bitcoin has forked two or three times to handle bugs 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:39:24
LN has "been coming" for 3 years :D
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:20:55
it forked once not counting upgrades

the fun thing here is that all accounts and keys are already public, how do you actually "own" it ? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:22:19
BitcoinMarkets is the only worth sub now 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:59:26
you said that already :P
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:33:54
if you don't want to argue objectivly with fact let's just stop this?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:41:18
May be, don't see how that counters the facts in my statement 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:16:16
yes that was not a store of value :P
(No don't kill me i did not mean BCH or something else)
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:33:45
Yes that's profit taking and is very healthy, the point is you protected your investment until that point and might now be more risky instead of just continuing with what made you successful the first time 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:29:00
Hard to make a smart contract illegal 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:37:54
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:00:23
Or chainlink 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:48:16
ok then we stop it
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:15:56
lol, if BTC can not even withstand some bad words from an unpolite guy like roger ver and you think this is something to really care about, we can just give up here and now. this is nothing
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:33:29
I thought the point of BTC was... unregulated money
@_date: 2018-05-13 11:18:59
you must not be aware of FED QE and bailouts I See
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:55:02
since you have 0 profit if you never sell... no
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:44:20
Ah I see, like store of value VS buying coffee 
@_date: 2018-05-13 11:18:32
no but to use the USD for real stocks and funds would be much safer. BTC is a high risk asset where ones net worth % should be very small when starting out
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:37:39
Is this some kind of pointless competition I missed or what?
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:28:37
One is money, many others are not so
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:43:47
to even have the idea of some stupid "vote" lol
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:42:05
OK ?
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:55:21
on the other hand, famous speculators like George Soros make a lot of money managing risk. It's no contradiction, it's just different
@_date: 2019-03-08 10:22:43
stupid bear market cope

That's what the great feature with blockchain and cryptos is - everyone can use mine or fork whatever how often they want.
Every time this happen it shows the strength of this kind of technology imo
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:41:17
how often does this happen when buying coffee or a book ?
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:42:40
The moment you run open source software or blockchain you are agreeing that anyone can fork it at any time or block. That by itself makes things legitimate
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:47:11
Yes, I don't get what there is to fight for now. The community was apparently to big for a one size fits all solution and now they forked and don't need to involve each other anymore
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:33:32
There is so much drama now so I sold mine. If things get more stable, maybe I go back in with 5% or so
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:34:31
Investing is  basically the definition of "doing something for monetary gain"....
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:57:55
The funny thing was this have been possible with BTC for like 3 years, using things like Bitwala. And now more advanced solutions are coming that support ERC-20 tokens and so on
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:37:47
Exactly, the decision and the outcome of it are two different things
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:23:34
Yep, that's a thing the people here complaining about attacks, the "moral right thing" to do and so on doesn't understand. All this things makes Bitcoin more antifragile ( and more probable to exists even longer.
It is a GOOD thing to all the time have to defend or adapt to those things

but isn't it 3 now ? Or are btc one for this new fork too?
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:24:40
Yes so the key is how long this time is. And how to explain all your new money... :P
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:36:51
Nice, now everyone get what they wanted and the real power of blockchains was shown
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:45:08
This was a good read, but what confuses me the most is that both "sides" doesn't present there argument so much but mostly complain about "core centralization" or "chinese trolls"
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:48:47
So when comes the LTC to LCH fork ? XD
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:08:47
It could also have gone down. He needed the milk
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:19:09
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:23:17
Why not just use a Bitcoin, Ethereum or similar credit card to buy things with them just like the gold one he shows ?
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:45:00
that must be it! Those sneaky bitcoin cashers now using strange books !
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:30:03
In theory yes, but in general the state really hates when you try to avoid tax. Even more than violence and drugs
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:54:10
maybe the future rewards will be worth it ?
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:54:04
How is that a bad thing? It shows the power of crypto currencies imo
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:41:32
This graph is to zoomed out for my taste ,  I only do 15m and panic buy and sell on that
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:02:36
No, because they will be on two different blockchains. It's like cloning/copying a folder of images on your computer. If you copy folder "image1" to folder "image2" the content will be the same until you move things from "image2" folder which will then not affect the image1
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:21:55
So then the best option would be to sell BCH for BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:38:58
ah, i read something about 5k BCH nodes there so might be it
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:54:00
There is a huge middle area between holding for ever and day trading... but yes people like to draw to extremes
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:21:10
Always good to check volume and momentum. Then maybe you think it's time to scale out some profits
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:03:52
This is so cool. Regardless of anyones opinion about Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash or other cryptos, I think everyone can agree that this is a truly great move for all crypto!
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:34:33
Really though? I don't agree with your premise but is it not better to have more BCH holders and not centralize the ownership if you are worried about that ?
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:26:10




I see this kind of "hodl vs sell out" a lot , but I don't get the logic. Let's say I buy 100$ worth of BTC, that now is worth 120$. Ok time to sell because I need the money or whatever. This doesn't disqualify me for ever in the future to re enter the market and still be part of the uptrend. 
The opportunity  cost or risk adjustment of not selling at a certain point is not worth it for  some
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:34:10
So what would the actual drawback be by using all features LTC has but with same set of bitcoin devs ?
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:34:49
I saw some posts at r/btc complaing about bcash, but I don't see the problem? It's like zcash but bcash :D
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:45:18
Actually Ripple is quite a nice middle solution between normal banking and blockchain, but not for "investing" in it since the company themselves said that's not what it's for
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:41:14
you can also win in a casino
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:27:27
The risk exposure will still be the same even if the market is very uptrending. Rebalancing or dollar cost averaging is never bad
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:09:01
They closed the trollbox then it went downhill
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:52:01
This is actually one of the biggest strengths with BTC, but I see it often ignored here. That it's a big use case for trading in and out of other cryptos and send them around in a stable way
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:26:37
hahaha I fit too well in here...
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:37:17
Bitcash sounds quite scammy to me acutally, like "digital gold" like
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:18:16
It's rather the opposite, he had his views but there was no party for it...
@_date: 2018-06-23 15:09:33
worked out really good for gold the last years... I give up enjoy your 70% drawdown
trading subs only from now on
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:21:11
Yes, this is the big thing here. For some reason people in crypto get very emotional with "their coin"(economic interest) and call a lot of things scams when they are exactly doing what crypto and blockchains does best, which is forking and creating decentralized solutions for the free market to use.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:45:47
Yes but in IT things go A LOT faster
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:59:30
Haha I was thinking exactly the same 
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:33:35


Except the last 7 months of course ? :)
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:58:39
Depends on your timeframe. Since 7 months we are in a clear downtrend, which is shown by now higher highs being set, and a visiting of previous lows
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:28:31
Except of the name and the blockchain and the software of course... 
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:27:15
IDEX solved the problem of a quite nice decentralized exchange in less than 1 year while BTC had around 8 or 9 years to try to solve it and has big volume for a decentralized exchange
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:35:23
this "strong hands hurr durr muh pressure" is a stupid meme. to cut losses is rational, not something else
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:31:29
3. Never all in trade or all in HODL. Avoid big drops by risk managing by stop loss orders, mental or on exchange
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:36:59
That's the nice thing with the forks. We can try both ways in a "real setting" and see what works best or people prefer. Forks or new cryptos are more possibilites in general, that is nice
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:26:26
I fail to see the contradiction here
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:57:46
no, since a bear market is buy high sell low like most people here it seems...
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:24:04
The price of an asset is not related to your gain or loss, so yes
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:47:41
came for the gains, stayed for the memes
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:38:52
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:02:05
I think what he actually means is, the times(seven) bitcoin failed to push through a NEW ath and then fell back consierably
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:53:38
If you're in it for the tech, how does the price matter?
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:32:08
yes i guess no one will have any opinions about taking some of that crypto profit then... lol
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:26:13
Hindsight bias. Also there is a huge opportunity cost of being fully invested in something. 
Putting 1-5% of that BTC into ETH or DASH 2 years ago would have been a very good investment for example.
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:16:07
Well if you shorted the wicks you point to you would make more money so you are right even though you think you prove something else :D

 a turkey who is fed by the farmer every morning for 1,000 days. Eventually the turkey comes to expect that every visit from the farmer means more good food. After all, that’s all that has ever happened so the turkey figures that’s all that can and will ever happen. But then Day 1,001 arrives. It’s two days before Thanksgiving and when the farmer shows up, he is not bearing food, but an ax. The turkey learns very quickly that its expectations were catastrophically off the mark. And now Mr. Turkey is dinner.

Buying an index of the worlds biggest and most technological advaned economy is QUITE different from buying a highly speculative asset without much connection to fundamentals vs value. Bitcoin is more like oil or gold that fluctuates a lot.
If you want to look at hold strategy, look at altcoins 3 years back and today and tell me how many that is left.
There is no aboslutes here, if you have a loss cut it or scale out at least, also remember that if you never sell you made 0 profit
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:32:30
Never go all in with anything, be it bitcoin, gold or stocks. I know some people like to upvote "I took a loan go to go full BTC/ETH/LTC" but that is just stupidity

that's quite a long list and has basically nothing to do with the risk reward of cutting losses. we will see
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:11:49

You can use Revolut or Transferwise for that, with lower fees

Not saying you should try to do trading if you don't want to learn it or put time in it, but there are some quite simple things to look for on act on.
For example Bitcoin rising around 8-10%, then look for a pullback or consolidation. Been a quite safe strategy in all pumps last 6 months

@_date: 2017-11-05 14:47:34
One "bitcoin" yes but multiple forks of a successful open source project that solves different problems I do not really see the problem ?
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:05:08
ok so? Apparently a lot of people make money otherwise where is for example BTC inflow to other coins coming from?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:20:00
Also, HOW many times are people going to need to be reminded about:
Not your keys = NOT YOUR COINS ?
@_date: 2019-12-19 07:12:02
But this can be used to offset a normal buy too. But most aren't using it like that

It's almost like you could use a Master or Visa card connected to your bankaccount instead. Crazy

Yes but if you make a cryptocurrency that is not meant for payment but for let's say steam hats, of course it makes sense to have partnerships. 
This one could then be build as a protocol on top of BTC, ETH or NEO chains

Bitcoin and cryptos is like the definition of antifragile 
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:56:48
Well no, but they will be replaced and some(DASH, XMR, XEM) will  keep their positions. The amount is growing for every year
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:23:44
Sure, but just because something is hard to do doesn't mean that the underlying platform(email server in my example) is bad in itself.  Also from what I have seen, the bugs haven't  been about cryptography but more simple noob mistakes like signature checks and overflow errorrs
Bitcoin is for payments, Ethereum is for distributed computing. Payments are of more importance to people to be secure, so of course it makes sense to test it more. Bitcoin is bank software, Ethereum is something like new version of Java or Apache that has way more room for testing and trying new solutions. If someone don't like their solution they can just use something else like NEO, Rootstock or EOS
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:06:48
No idea, but probably at least 95% will fail compared to their targets within the next 2 years. Similar to all startups,  people trying to get good at sports and son

You never trade with your whole holdings, I have 95% of my ETH and BTC stored away then trade with the rest. Only risking 5% for a very good upside.  
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:09:11
1) Almost one year old before big alt bull trend of early this year
2) I said alt trading, not holding
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:06:41
YEs, this is very true. This is why I never understood people here cheering any kind of crypto regulation from SEC and complain about "scams"

but the difference is LN is not here yet...
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:21:44
That's not because trading then, it's because bad risk and position management.
This is the error almost all people make, having to big positions and risk.
Fact is that if you use small amount(1-3% of your BTC) for trading alts the upside is huge and the downside is quite limited as look as you risk manage your losses.
Not saying everyone should start trading, but you can do both
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:25:22
I meant more like the adopters of btc and other cryptos vs the ones without
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:53:45
Very good post yes, always sell in % over time. That will make you always have a part that can grow. Also remember that you can still keep your BTC and do alt trading, I never sell crypto for a fiat loss 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:07:40

@_date: 2017-09-05 17:43:20
Don't know, and also the reverse is for things with BTC. I don't like the "one blockchain for all" philosophy, that never ever ends well with software. Look at realplayer or mozilla browser.
ETH, BTC and XMR at the same time, that's a nice thing !
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:42:09
Yes, if you don't put all your savings into BTC or need the cash right now(also with other cryptos), the realization that you still have them and can buy things or trade alts is a big one to do. There is now a lot of good opportunities on Bittrex for example, then sell back to BTC a week later

You are right about the brand impression part but tech part is like comparing scam email with email servers and say both is bad 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:29:56
Maybe we start seeing a "tech race" between the old banks? Those who get on the blockchain revolution vs those who don't, and then of course the corresponding FUD wars
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:09:01
Your first and second sentence do not contradict each other. There are around maybe 20-30 very interesting projects right now, trying to solve problems Bitcoint don't. CMM is perfect for this
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:19:22
it's like "being tired of email" because you can send spam
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:01:14
Yes, it's a totally OK position to have and you seem consistent with it. My comment first was more about the people that in one day say "BTC is good down with the banks" then get super happy when SEC wants to regulate ICOs and "haha told you so X is a scam coin". That does not just work out for me :P
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:49:15
The difference is that the "ICO government" in your case is on a voluntary basis, and also one could argue that Bitcoin or Dogecoin or whatever with their protocol rules is
Enforcing what the free market put their funds on is real regulation
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:23:55
Exactly, I feel the main problem is that people don't know if they want to invest or trade then end up in the middle being bad at both
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:52:14
No... in the uptrend and buy in sideways then stop limit for down trend
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:07:02
Yes but the sentiment here has shifted the last 2 years or so. Before it was a lot "i want to pay for coffee everywhere", now it's more "big international transactions, compare those fees to big bank tx"
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:27:03
no idea
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:48:17
a currency is a mean of exchange, broadly speaking. That's the reason BTC is used for almost all altcoin pairs, and not for example DOGE or DASH. It has the currency reputation and functionality
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:04:07
I don't get this picking sides things at all. Why do you need to be "opposed" or "for" this fork or any of them? Just use which software you like, just as you write, and be happy that open source works and others can use what version they like.
In the end it's about decentralisation and technology , not keeping attached to a project just because 
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:44:35
Never understood those comments, they seem to assume no one ever re enters the market ?
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:25:59
OK, that's a fair point of view to have but I think markets are markets.
Anyways yes, most altcoins are just "the new bitcoin" but from all those failures also a lot of good alternatives rise. DOGE for micropayments, XMR for anonymity,  GNT for rented computer power and so on. 
Also of course this might not justify their valuations but a new tech sector needs to have a lot of failures for the good projects to come out. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:13:50
How can I send BTC anonymous or use it for onchain gambling? Or stake them
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:51:12
Yes but a major advantage for a currency is the network effect which BTC has, which is what I meant with BTC vs other cryptos as currency
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:37:22
this is a good thing
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:49:29
Well there are some hard debates between btc, bcash, ethereum supporters and so on,  but in the end I think all agree that crypto, decentralization, less big banks and so on is a good thing
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:50:30
you forgot in reddit everyone lives in the US looooool !
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:33:32
Yes, this I agree on but that's a more political/social issue than the pure technical part. I think there is room for both, also the incentive for "everyone" to switch was quite high in the ETH case.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:24:25
Maybe they can get private keys to a split wallet ? ;D
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:12:32
You could always margin trade with your crypto as collateral, but I don't recommend it
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:16:35
Lol lol up trend reversal and bounces and look at the volume 
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:35:18
So what's your argument? It is not there for BTC  yet or is it?  If not, then XMR succeeded better in implementing it
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:44:50
You missed the point with my comment I think :P  
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:49:49
I see, that's a fair point even though I do not agree with the premise. It's like you want a free market for car makers, but government should still regulate the safety and so on, right ?
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:31:57
and after every threat, bitcoin and cryptos grows stronger
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:58:49




Well that's true for most things.... value is only what someone is willing to pay
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:30:10
I also like to sell in uptrends, especially when most people post memes and say "last chance to buy below X" :D My rule is that if bitcoin or ethereum subreddits have mainly memes on the front page - it's time to sell
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:56:23
A good thing if you want perfect and secure code, a  bad thing if you want to try a lot of things and see what works and not and attract a bigger community.
As long as people are aware of the trade offs, everything is fine.
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:16:49




Do you have any idea how mining or consensus work?
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:46:34
OK, there differs our opinion since it's in fact used. If it's not what you measure crypto platform success as, that's another thing
But in the end I am crypto agnostic, I want all kinds of project to fail and succeed and to learn from each other
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:09:17
Very few, and looking at some quite hyped ICOs getting hacked in different ways shows that even more simple ones for image sharing or whatever idea also is quite vulnerable.
It's not so much matter of who asks and not, but more of what people will create. Creation leads to a bigger community, which leads to more people and so on because more resources to learn from. Of course there will be a lot of bad things, but this is needed to try things out and learn about failures.
I think more that a whole new class of smart contract/blockchain coders will come , just like database coders or front end developers. Some will do the formal verification parts(maybe it can even be done blockchain agnostic?),some will do token handling, some revenue models and so on
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:51:39
So, the same as BTC Core?
Yes, but who many knew about it or mining? You ended up with a lot of early miners with CPUs
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:32:42
Yes it was just something I came up with here and now, on protocol vs what uses it.  
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:17:45
Why?  
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:52:12


You just wrote it, anonymity. A lot of people think bitcoin is more anonymous that it is.
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:37:57


Missed the last 6 months of fund raising ICOs?
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:50:41
Some do, like Tezos
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:10:46
Thank you, will take a look. 
I am somewhere in the middle, just buy and hold is as stupid as trying to day trade into big profits. Fees will eat you then for example. But on the other hand, to have stop losses to protect your gains against black swan events(let's say 2001 plane crashes) is equally stupid
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:21:38
Might be, but for me that is a good thing. This will make Bitcoin and in  the long run other cryptos more resistant to attacks and so on.  
The name thing I agree with, because that is (if the intent is so, which I have no opinion on yet) can mislead new users, just like the ponzi thing BitConnect
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:51:23


Never ever sell all or buy for all fiat. Bad money management is not the same as bad trading. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:59:39
Would be fun to see if some tulip company from back then actually exists still and what their value is :D
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:29:47
Bad, but quite clever still :P
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:19:22
it's like "being tired of email" because you can send spam
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:56:42
How can you think government regulations is good and still like btc? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:16:52


He or you or me or anyone could have created a patch to do that, then it was up to the miners to mine that chain and users to use it
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:20:29
You would have NOW yes, but not in a few years after. All depends on your time frame, and if you get stop lossed out in profit you are SURE you get a profit, not only betting on it. Also you could start averaging your way in
But anyway, if someone don't want to trade at all I don't complain, I just make the  point there is a huge middle ground
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:45:58
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:06:29
Of course the market at some point will say "this sucks because X% adoption" , but the simple rule not your keys not your coins still apply
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:05:43
Sure, but this will probably lead to that the Bitcoin coding community will be much smaller than say the NEO or Ethereum one because higher barrier of entry. Which can be both good or bad depending how you look at things
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:22:16
Yes but you did what was best in that situation. You could argue with that about anything...
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:37:21
That's why we need multiple cryptos. No software that has tried to solve everything has ever been good
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:09:08
1) Almost one year old befor big alt bull trend of early this year
2) I said alt trading, not holding
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:30:28
unless you get a brain damage and forget your key, the ledger nano gets crushed and so on. everything has risk vs reward
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:21:30
Tell that to  Equifax
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:30:39
I have been buying both ETH and BTC for several years, so yes. One of the biggest decentralised exchanges is run on ETH, so it has great value already
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:23:10
Being 22 and one of the smartest persons in the world when it comes to decentralisation, blockchain and cryptography  maybe ?
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:13:53
Also remember ETH has only been live for 2 years vs 9 for bitcoin. Bitcoin has also forked and rolled back in early days
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:04:04
No but for a lot of people it will be enough to travel by canoes if they had no means of transportation at all before
That is a very tech focused argument, but that is not how software business works regardless of what you think of it or who you personally want to pay for writing your code
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:07:48
or BitcoinDark
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:59:08
Trade with 5% rebalance and put profits in long term ETH and BTC hodl wallets 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:51:28
yes I like all cryptos. What should I have "made up my mind" about as you imply ? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:54:09
I am not  really arguing for either of the positions here, I just want to bring some counter points to the "wooow now we will solve all problems Ethereum have go Bitcoin" sentiment here.
It's also a money thing, if there isn't so many people to hire for a company they could not try to scale(legitimate or not) their business and so on which leads to people who want to code smart contracts for more than just "using the best" are going to learn the more profitable but insecure things
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:50:12


Why do people spread this myth? Holding is a viable strategy, but it's not by definition BETTER than doing some trading while keeping a low risk profile. Fact is that if you put 1% of your BTC into different alts the last months and traded back to BTC you would have a lot more BTC to hold
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:26:45


And how many developers know those? It's rarely the languages that defines success of a platform
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:09:25


Monero works very well or?
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:08:02
One of the few I never heard a bad thing about
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:07:58


wut :D
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:04:47
I think most big ones do ? I got mine automatically at an exchange
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:12:45
No I want to build stairs down to all sides
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:17:35
The main reason to trade alts is to get more btc...
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:25:57
On the other hand, software has a trade off between time to market and perfection. A lot of software needs to be "just enough" for people to use it. And usage creates network effects and ecosystem Look at websites built on PHP vs Haskell for example
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:44:45
Options is not there yet, for some reason but Bitmex and OKEX offers different kinds of futures currently yes. They even have their own blog about strategies 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:31:28


Since the last trade decides the price, no
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:10:41
There was a lot of good reasons to work, but this must be the weakest "argument" ever. Just admit you want other tech + developers
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:16:44
No, since anyone at any time can create a fork.  I can write a script that does it every hour and copy all users balances. Is there a theft if you were the one not buying or creating what you now have ? No
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:15:14
Something someone pays for by definition has value, so who's the idiot... 
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:39:00
could you not use  ?
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:44:46
I haven't used it enough to have a good opinion on that, I only know that when things are getting too strict and formal in programming, people tend to use the more easier to use option at the cost of security or stability
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:28:32
No but if you have your bitcoin in a wallet and not using it, you can not utilize the value before buying something. in the end, it's the same for a fiat account, because of inflation and so on but which much less risk  and volatility
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:23:17
Yes, and if they want to change the tech behind it's also aligned with their interest to not be mixed up with the original BTC
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:31:47
It's not the amount of being right, it's the result when being right that counts
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:25:01
it's not a good thing that only those who can afford asic miners can mine ? why ?
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:15:52




Yes,and this is what is so nice about blockchains and open source. Apart from the "trying to be the real BTC" thing, I do not see why so many bitcoin  users are against those forks. They show how great the technology is, and there can also be a place for different chains with different rulesets
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:40:14
 , also usable without the web UI so 100% uptime exchange and no hack chance(if the contract is secure of course)  or withholding user funds
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:11:49
Yes this "If i would" memes here are so tiresome. Those people might have sold at 3k or 300 or whatever too even if they bought at 100$ for whatever reasons in life
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:44:37




Exactly, never understood why people need to "convince the other sides". just use whatever
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:05:41
They still have a place, usually tech never replaces something but the older thing adapts
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:15:24
With this logic, non dividend paying stocks(like Amazon) are sort of scam too
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:39:15
Try paying your rent or lunch in BTC then. Also, tax implications
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:02:06
But at some point you want to spend them right? That "some point" is different for people
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:43:52
Exchanges trade oil or rice futures, that doesn't mean it's currencies
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:55:35
Well the market cap is still the market cap. Lower market cap = less money needed for bigger returns
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:07:09
I think  is the best balanced sub, imo there is no need to be "for" or "against" either fork. Just know what they are and use what you want
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:29:52




i see this being said a lot, any statistic to back it up? Not saying you are wrong, if you want to trade you should and if you want to hodl you should but not try both
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:04:54
You can have the nicest code things in the world but they are worthless if no one uses them
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:04:34
This will happen for sure, but that's a part of  coding and things maturing. Just look at all big credit card och email hacks from big famous companies
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:14:45
and the margin handling is really strange, it somehow changes dynamically
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:08:26
But they could also implement all of BTC and LTCs upcoming features quite easily or ?
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:34:10
In theory I agree with your reasoning, but I know that is not how software development works. Companies want results, developers will take shortcuts because of this and so on and when a company using for example ETH can say "here is the first contract doing X" they will get some marketing and users that don't care about the security but will drive revenue to the company
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:27:31
Because you could not interact with all contracts that are already there, like Etherdelta for example
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:35:50
You need to separate the use case from the technology or adoption. Is a lot of email spam? Yes. Does it make email a bad thing? No
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:13:01
One reason is that the block times are now around 30s instead of 15, but this will be updated with the new hard fork it seems. I don't know all the details
The "X looks good and will solve our problem" is quite common in crypto communities, (same for lightning network, rootstock, ethereum pos) but the thing is it is NOT here yet so why not just wait and see how things will turn out
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:50:46
But it solves the problem so I don't see the failure really
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:56:42
Also the same with trading "AHHH YOU SHOULD HAV HODLLLDEDDD" yes but AT THAT POINT it was a good decision, you did not KNOW that the price would go up but you made maybe a 30% profit which is very good.
Also those people think everyone "cashes out" and then never enter the market again for some reason...
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:57:26
It was for people wanting bigger block size 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:55:42
But ED has a lot of usage, also idex.market is upcoming and have some nice solutions for faster trades
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:39:21
How would bitcoin multisig solve the problem of doing function calls for things like etherdelta?
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:33:45
Why? You can use a lot of blockchain related tech without having a crypto currency tied to it. The solving of the byzantime problem together with the incentive to run the network is the really cool thing about Btc, but you don't need to use it all.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:12:38
Of course you can Make specific hardware for anything, but currently more people can mine eth than btc and for me that's a good thing 
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:26:25
One mans floor is another mans ceiling
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:31:06
Not really, there is a huge middle area between "waiting for the epic dip to -80" and "buying at the ATH because it's today"
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:12:32
How is LTC centralized ?
Also BTC Is practically pre mined too
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:42:51
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:24:34
No, but why buy it if no dividends are payed unless to sell it to the next fool?
I agree, but this shows the influence of bitcoin and blockchains and open source, so I do not see the problem 
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:07:30
Since ETH never has been about store of value, arguing that it's bad for store of value is like saying Word is bad for playing games :P
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:24:25
In theory yes, but the value is still what someone wants to pay
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:52:26
Sure, but I have been hearing this "If we get LN/Rootstock/X then Y" for several years and it's not there now so...
What I really look forward to is in between chain decentralised exchanges :D
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:12:04
There is no contradiction in doing both, but of course if you don't want to trade or speculate BTC, ETH and things like XMR or LTC are the solid bets
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:52:17


At least last year, but with Binance and Bitfinex adding more USD pairs this trend is about to shift now imo. In general BTC moves with the market, but the same is for tech stocks and so on
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:55:44
the are actually underpriced compared to ATH levels, btc is like 50-60% down but many alts 70-80%
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:39:02
"not enough" is always the answer
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:38:29
so what? Who decides what they "need"? If someone provides work, they should get payed
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:38:58
How can Paypal charge for "international" transfers when the company itself is international? It's not like they have servers in one city in UK or whatever... 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:50:38
also protip: you did not make money until you sold
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:28:37
i hope you and me are in the same country, so reddit doesn't charge the "International Comment Fee" :o
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:26:54
but you are talking about two differen things. the intent and possibility vs how it affects the market and ownership
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:33:46
If you watch Billions, it was, or cryptocurrency, also mentioned several times in the last episode
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:00:47
but that was the point I assume, fiat money is just valuable because the government force it vs crypto that people believe has a value to them
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:32:17
lol do you even understand the concept of decentralized money ? and why are you here then
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:40:24
that is exactly what it is, the literal opposite to federal reserve issued printed money...
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:48:31
Sure, but this is not a counter argument that BTC, and a lot of other crypto supply ownership is heavily skewed towards early miners or creators 
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:34:02
Axelrod in crypto = BULLISH
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:11:32


Ah so like when the early BTC users mined on a cpu
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:52:29
Yeah but in reality how many did and knew? Supply and market wise there is no difference 
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:03:13
You could always use localbitcoins or so
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:38:54
Eh, you know that LTC was 4$ in February this year and now is 40$ right? that's 10x in not even half a year. Bitcoin "only" doubled in the same time
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:32:58
Bitcoin was from a perspective also heavily premined. 
Also I do not get this bitcoin crowd anti ICO thing, is not decentralized markets good anymore ?
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:20:16
I mean for people buying Bitcoin from let's say 2011 or so on when it gained popularity the first time. ETH foundation could have run the Ethereum network by themselves in the beginning too and mined a lot of coins, but chose another model. For people looking from it 2 years later, it's the same thing
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:11:52
This so much. Never understood either this or problem with forking or "not wanting to work". That for me is like the whole THING; everyone can fork and mine whatever they want with whatever rules they want.
Then the users and market decides what to use
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:07:20
OK, I am not so much in to the recent Bitcoin drama but I don't really see a problem with that. That's the beauty of decentralization, all users can do and run what they want. As long as it's done in an open and transparent way
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:17:02
That's true
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:52:50
Ok, but it's by all usages a fork since it will take something that is there and fork a version to it's own from it
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:15:32
Yes but where to draw the line? If they would accept bcc now they open themselves up to a lot of demand in the future 
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:41:10
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:18:13
Never got this at Reddit, but not everyone lives in the US.  
Also they can not "kill "ICOs, it's funny that so many people love blockchains and decentralization and at the same time think a blockchain based concept can be regulated.
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:44:54
That was my point, it's always up to the miners.  It's exactly the same for Bitcoin and why all this drama going on
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:08:00
OK, but why not just split into a segwit coin for those who want ? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:39:30
I see, cool 
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:08:13
But if people talk about crypto it's good for bitcoin, and other way around
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:31:32
It's only your coins if you control the keys
True for all cryptos and crypto tokens
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:41:20
OK, then its a different point yes
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:00:26
Best for what? Bitcoin for cash transfers with high security because of network power. If you look for anonymity or speed  others are better.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:09:25
But how is it actually a problem? Decentralization is good and this will lead to less fights? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:43:39
Not really, I do not say both has it's value I was just arguing against the statement "doubled many times over"
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:26:45
Arcade City ? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:02:33
So BTC was not distributed to early low tech miner investors ? lol
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:18:17
I see, so it's not a technical thing it's more like "lets get sure everyone gets on board". Still annoying with those long times...
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:09:46
So in the end, everyone gets what they want. I don't see a problem
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:07:37
Yes, I do not see why people actually complain about this? It's the same in Ethereum subreddits, people complain that ETC is a "scam coin" but it's in the nature of open source and consensus blockchains, everyone can mine whatever chan they want.  And it's a GOOD thing!
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:33:56
Sure it's an interesting thing but how does this have to do with HODL ?
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:07:49
lol people still doing the "bailout central control argument"  ?
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:48:16
Yes and the naming is very confusing. Segwit 2x is at least readable 
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:55:20
As I wrote below, one could argue that if one or a few controls the network and mine 1000s of coins, how does it differ in the end ?
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:12:48
around, it's already started ? :D
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:14:14
Sure, and everyone gets what they want
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:12:31
Sure, I understand the technical differences but still  the price of those CPU cycles then even if it was all fair and transparent doesn't matter much when it comes to who has a lot of coins or not in the long term.
But on the other hand, that's sort of the only way to do it so I  have no opinion against it but just thinks that there is a bit too much complaining about a small difference
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:06:04
May be with hindsight results now, I was referring to higher volatility compared to eth when it arrived 
And reading comments below, just because eth was better doesn't make etc buy a bad one
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:36:11
Well you don't have BTC in a "specific" wallet, you could still use your private key and interact with them from a supporting wallet/node 
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:03:57
Depends what you mean with "manipulated". The source code is open source and free for anyone to run, and in theory for any crypto miners can choose to run another version
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:59:48
Every blockchain basically has 2 parts
1) miners running the network
2) Users using the network
Unless both of those agree on using the same protocol, a fork will occur or the protocol will not have users. In theory ETH users could have done the same after Dao Hack, running some kind of software that let through those transactions or so. I am not super into the technical parts.
I agree that ETH is more controlled as in developers have more INFLUENCE, but from a protocol standpoint there is no practical difference from BTC
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:58:35
I agree, but on the other hand people here us probably not the target group 
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:57:01
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:40:08
another ELI5; Why does this need to take weeks and all this "signaling"? Why not just switch now or tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:55:04
well look at ETC, was quite a good buy last year
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:33:35
But holding the ETH crowdsale with bitcoin, the same as Tezos now held it with ETH and BTC, shows that bitcoin and ethereum already are successful :)
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:07:36
Or they think the cost is higher of managing them on their own vs Coinbase losing them
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:08:33
Yes, it seems like the fighting mentality that was with and different altcoins some 6 months ago also disappeared whichs is great. Let Bitcoin be bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:23:12
It's a fork still lol, why are people scared of using real definitions ?
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:45:31
"From a perspective" as I wrote, for the end users what is the difference if someone does something when he controls the network the first blocks vs issuing some kind of tokens in relation to allocation? Not much 
I agree a bit on your other part, this is why I only really like blockchain based dApps/ICOs when all activity is blockchain focused like ENS, gambling or identity management
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:48:22
Courts in US do not hold power over Bitcoin. And yes, I agree there is a difference between a lot of "share based cryptos" vs BTC.
Sure, but on the other hand you miss a lot of the features in having crypto based token that you could buy. Both can exist and I really look forward when then can interact through projects like interledger
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:20:52
Eh by definition it's exactly a fork? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:13:02
Yes, for the long term attacks on bitcoin and competing crypto currencies is a good thing both for bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general as it creates more antifragile protocols. And also shows what bitcoin should NOT be, a discussion I feel is very undiscussed currently
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:11:37
To rebalance your holdings for example 
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:03:47
both things can be true at once
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:20:34
Regarding Kraken, be aware that they are VERY slow during heavy traffic. Orders can take several minutes to execute.
But I never felt unsafe using Kraken, so it's not a bad option
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:51:47
So what's the difference for a user three years in? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:42:10
So at least some months more of drama :D 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:32:36
it can be the same thing but doesn't need to be
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:45:56
Yes agree
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:23:57
Also never understood this, I'm not into btc or eth or whatever just because, I am into decentralized networks and to do this is a STRENGTH 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:27:33
I understand the difference, I just say to the user it's  not a big one
also I don't get why people here need to be so rude instead of address arguments or points ?
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:28:50
It's somehow like it would be a bug in a popular BTC wallet and then BTC network decides to fork to solve this problem
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:39:06
so the one day shorting the 18 month bottom, this gets upvotes when shorters made profits 1 year in a row
yeah... what should one even say
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:57:22
I spend a lot of time here and on ethereum subreddits, but I have never heard a bad thing about Gemini !
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:35:38
I must agree on this. Although this sub has it's fair share of Bitcoin maximalists, then are actually FOR something. the is mostly AGAINST something, which is never a healthy long term strategy
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:55:47
They will never find out unless someone says it. Also it's rather strange, why can not the SEC of France to the same with that logic
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:12:46
Eh, that's basically the SOLUTION. Everyone can run what ever mining software they want, and get the proper amount of reward based on user base
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:58:16
I do not get this black and white reasoning. Just because you sell in a downtrend does not mean you sell at the very bottom and you don't buy back lower
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:46:39
That's not what I meant, I meant you need to control X physical locations if you spread out your key
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:51:04
I meant PoW vs PoS. A lot of coins do one or the other, or maybe even hybrid?
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:34:53
This, and also things like interledger where BTC can interact with other blockchains like Ripple or Zcash
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:30:16
and this is the nice thing with all those different ones, the market tries them out and see what works and not. And also learn from Bitcoin what to do and not. In the end , all who like crypto will benefit regardless of name
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:07:01
Yea that's super fast compares to three days 
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:24:11
Interesting read, thx
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:58:17
Well stocks works the same way
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:03:29
No it doesn't ? It falling steeper every month lol
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:59:42
that is not comparable
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:25:43
Yes :P
This is the question, and therefore it's good with those performance tests and evaluate things.
Maybe LTC can fill the middle gap between both ?
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:35:58
The question is - why would such a developer want to work with old style company as VISA...
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:05:54
because you don't know who create the projects and can not then find them
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:57:37
Well, to be honest I did not necessarily meant more projects in themselves. Your example is a good one of this type of projects. However, for ETH tokens you need a smart contract like Etherdelta I guess ? Or could bitsquare support also this ?
Yes,  decentralized blockchain gambling that is impossible to regulate and has a huge market possibility. Gambling and porn will as usual lead the technology development :P 
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:51:33
illegal in US, but ok thx for the explanation
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:31:58
ICO blocking ETH network
BTC news getting price up
This timewindow + time is not a fair comparison  , just look at YTD % increase for example...
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:40:32
So in other words, it's a good thing because it's a limit to learn from on the live net
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:00:44
Because if it's that high the payment infrastructure for BTC is everywhere so you don't need to "sell" them just purchase those things with BTC directly
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:39:28
After not looking into Bitcoin things for over a year, I hope the scaling debate really is done this time so I can go back to talk to people about BTC
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:53:49
Yea then we can finally move forward. Have been staying away from btc in one year just because this drama 
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:52:14
Well consenys or coinbase pays quite well I guess 
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:03:21
Well if there has been 10-20% upwards movement you can be quite sure there will be a pullback.
Of course risk is involved and trading is mainly about minimizing risk and picking trends 
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:53:25
They are good for most things except trading lol
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:33:39
Because you can 
1) Prove that the mechanism is fair. But you mention this I see, so how can this be done with out a software? I saw someone posted that you can prove that the tx themselves was executed, but I am talking about the whole process.
2) Reach regulated markets like US and Germany, with a zero trust solution
3) Create a "backend contract" that works with several dApps
But in general I agree with you, if there is a "smaller" solution that solves everything it's generally better to go with it because faster and cheaper. But also I feel that the Bitcoin community doesn't have this culture of other things than payments, and that's a good thing. Not everyone should do everything
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:44:51
It was a reason i wrote minerS, not miner. Meaning that they can , regardless of what software devs from BTC, ETH or some other coin do or not, change what software or chain to mine on if they have consensus. That's like the whole point
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:18:34
The difference is LTC has a strong network and simple use case
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:39:50
What about art, houses(like specific ones) or diamonds ?
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:40:03
This US focus is getting boring and annoying in itself, but apart from that yes it's good to talk about.
Also reinforces my point that blockchain based currencies should stay on the blockchain
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:26:46
not bought enough shitcoins at polo XD
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:57:57
Yes, I see and that's my point.
No they was right, everything pointed at a top last year 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:24:01
Tell me how shorting each bounce for 1 year was not a profitable thing? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:33:01
And this is how it should be since, a lot of other cryptos is not aiming for a currency.
Let each one do what they do best!
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:37:50
I think mostly a lot of people have a lot of old cheap ETH, so for them it's not really "USD value"
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:31:16


What would the difference from that perspective be ?
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:36:00
All chains are only immutable to the next block, then miners can do whatever
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:07:42
Also faster blocktimes,  i feel that LTC for microtransactions is a quite underestimated solution
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:05:54
Nice, I did not know this. Will check it out!
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:36:06
Since BTC and some other coins here solve different problems, I do not see the correlation.
For example. BTC has no anonymity functions at all right now ?
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:28:48
Not really, just in general. For example, one could do a decentralized exchange or a file storing smart contract solution with a provable code how to handle funds entered
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:32:57




Wasn't the thing with blockchains to not exists in state jurisdictions? This is a US Supreme Court thing what I can see.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:49:55
Well, I would say it's better to detect those now than later.
But yes, scaling in general seems like a "hard problem" for all blockchains to solve in a consistent way. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:41:45
Mtgox was partly acting with USD, ICOs are done only on blockchain on a voluntary basis
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:56:19
Exactly my point, because huge uncertainties it's better to do blockchain only projects
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:19:16
"Will bring" is not the same as "right now". What are better? Also, is it not an advantage in itself to be decoupled from BTC when doing some stuff ?
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:50:04
Ok, yes but still you can not be SURE that your key is not compromised even though unlikely
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:56:10
OK I have no knowledge about that test
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:55:08
So "is this it" then, if implemented 1 august? The reason I stayed away from BTC for over a year is this drama, from BOTH sides. I just want some progress so BTC can be used for fast and cheap payments as intended an other coins can be used for what they were built for
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:53:24
So how do you prove the process? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:07:23
That's why issueing tokens only on blockchain based projects is the best thing, then they can't stop you
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:30:50
A lot of bad projects has "Been around" for a long time. For software this does not mean much
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:18:20
no problem
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:11:31
Don't forget some "advisor" pictures
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:09:05
" I could print out a private key and store 20 copies in different locations, and they would exist at each place at the same time"
But also consider the downside of this compared to gold. If you know where your gold is you can be sure that it's there. You can not with keys spread out
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:52:36
Yes I agree, maybe "different upside" was wrong word I just wanted to point out that it's a nice thing(like you are) to be aware of
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:27:00
That there is not a competition, because some alts do things BTC don't have planned or do currently. Blocktime, anonymity, storage ,staking
But on the other hand I think a lot of the BTC price rise is because it's the first entry to altcoin trading, and when they look bad the thing people cash out to is BTC because thats the only option. Maybe ETH/ALT is available for 5% of the pairs but that's very small on volume also
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:27:18
So now we need another then we have done a full 360 and is cover in all directions :D
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:37:06
Isn't R3 sort of dead ?
