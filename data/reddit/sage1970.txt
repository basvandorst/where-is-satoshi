Nope, he hasn't responded to my messages even though he's still active on the subreddit. Openbazzar are very slow to respond and they're asking me to provide a lot of info. So, I'm not going to waste more time on this. After all, it was only about $25. I will try to get this dude banned though, so he doesn't scam others.

OK looks like transfer from weak hands to strong ones is over for now. Still, I think it'll hover around 10k for a while.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:45:00
That makes sense. I don't know why I missed the part of being able to route around massive nodes. Still a lot to learn about LN for low tech folks like myself. The exchange involvement is indeed very interesting. It sounds like if it happens one would only need to open one channel and keep funding it through the exchange instead of opening new ones, right? Can it be that easy? Not sure when or how often transactions would be settled on chain,
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:55:11
Interesting, but wouldn't that eventually lead to some centralization? Like if coinbase (or gemini, amazon..etc) becomes a VERY well connected node, would that mean more control over the network?

Just created a segwit electrum wallet, sent 0.005 btc to it from Gemini (free) and then sent the 0.005 btc for 0.000012 fees and it worked! One of the cheapest transactions I've made with electrum. I know I could've sent it for free from Gemini to the destination wallet but I just wanted to try segwit. The 2 transactions took under 10 min (including time I spent playing with the fees on electrum)

Where does he say the government will take over? That's your assumption and that's fine, but it's not his policy. Also, google and Amazon are corporation. His Net Neutrality policy would actually hurt big companies in favor of smaller competitors.

No regulation ever does that.
If you want to kill google and amazon, or at least put a dent in their dominance, you have to deregulate and stop subsidizing them so hard.
That's exactly what his net neutrality policy is about; not giving them a subsidy.
As for deregulation, that wouldn't stop google domination. Btw, he's the only Democrat candidate who's against breaking up google. No one wants to use the 5th best App, is his explanation why it's a stupid solution.

I don't know but I'm thinking that won't happen. LN might help solve part of the problem. As for lost bitcoins, I don't think it matters if all but 1 bitcoin is lost since it's divisible and price is just a number. People will become more educated and wallets will be more secure, I think/hope.

I'm not very good at this and I don't know how using 1 wallet in 2 different applications work but I was in a similar situation. Luckily I found out that I had swept my private keys before I lost access to my wallet and I was able to find the receiving address and the private key. This might be a dumb question but did you generate the private addresses on both multibit and Breadwallet or just 1 of them?

What you don't understand is that smoking alone doesn't cause lung cancer, heart disease...etc. Many other factors are involved like genetics, general health, other diseases and many more. So, on the one hand you have something that kills a healthy young person on the spot vs. something that contribute, with other factors, to chronic health conditions that can cause death over the span of decades. Now take that in consideration and tell me again which one you think is more dangerous.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:48:51
Right? It doesn't matter if it gets to 16k or not on Jan 18. I'd be selling the contract and on Jan 18 if it's below 16k I'd still make profit and if it's higher I'd miss out on the difference but I don't lose either way.

Why can't we (members of this subreddit who support core) start our own mining rig to help solve the mining centralization? I'm aware of the several technical, legal and logistic challenges and limitations but I think it's doable. A mining rig owned by the users that could be managed by a third party if necessary. My understanding is that mining is profitable, so we could start small and use a portion of the profits to expand. I'm sure there're members who have access to cheap electricity.

"Sure but if they hadn't smoked they'd be alive". Not necessarily true. They'd probably live a few more months, years. regarding the quality, the same could be applied to cigarettes. Also, the stats talk only about death due to OD, not death due to drug usage in general, not to mention drug-related murder and violence.

I've lost access to the wallet that contains most of my coins. There are ways to recover it if you have the device it's stored in but it requires some tech knowledge.

I first heard about bitcoin when it hit $1k. I already made a profit and still have some coins. So all of you celebrating the death of bitcoin, you're in the wrong place at the wrong time. The vast majority of peeps in this sub have already bested you. And it's going to get worse for you. Get used to it or take off the tinfoil hat and do some research. Maybe it's not too late.

That POS site is filled with hate speech and that breeds violence. The terrorist who attacked and killed people in the Synagogue was a frequent GAB user. His last post was something like "screw your optics". I checked the site and found several posts by white nationalists that said violence is not the right choice right now because of the "optics".

You still don't get it. Without cryptocurrencies there are no public Blockchains (which is what MS and other companies want to use). It doesn't matter if they don't care and that they don't use it. Without the tokens there's no blockchain (public decentralized ones).
 "Companies want control not be at the whim of the public"
That's an excellent point. Totally agree with you here, but how can they do that if the public decides to "burn" their tokens? Well, they either have to avoid using public Blockchains (but they said the DO want to use them) or try to control it, making it valuable again.

I'm not an expert on Bitcoin or the economy but here's why I think Bitcoin has value (until something better replaces it). Public Blockchains are already being used by companies for various purposes, which means they need to transact in the tokens of those Blockchains. Bitcoin has the most secure Blockchain and the biggest network, so it's reasonable to think that when more companies/governments choose to use the Blockchain technology their 1st choice would be Bitcoin. How's that not a value?

I think you're missing the big picture here. Even if companies make their own token when using/building on a public Blockchain, they're stil using the public token because without it they can't build anything. So that gives the token value even if it's not being transacted by said companies.
Also, I don't know why you say companies won't use Bitcoin. Didn't you hear about Microsoft recent announcement about using public Blockchains in the future? It specifically mentioned Bitcoin, etherium and second layer.

Yes they can but MS is considering a public one. So yes, you're right it hasn't happened yet but the potential is there.
The public won't burn their coins, but if I were MS CEO I wouldn't feel comfortable building on a structure that's owned by the public. What if a competitor buys most of those coins and then burn them? 
Also, the article was not about Bitcoin only. Listen to the guy/ He said more than once that "you can't separate the Blockchaion from the cryptocurrency" or something to that effect.

"Why would the majority of the people in the world buy something just to make transactions? That's absurd"
1- To transfer money internationally faster and cheaper than traditional methods.
2- To move money out of countries where there's a limit to how much money you can transfer legally.
3- To launder money.
4- to transact on the darknet.
5- As a collectible.
All those reasons make it valuable to a lot of people, which in turn makes it valuable to most people because they can sell it to those who use it for the above mentioned reasons.

Wouldn't make sense financially. If you're making 1% profit on every transaction, you'd be "stealing" the whole worth of the transaction in 100 transactions safely by continuing the business. Add to that the volume is increasing consistently. But, it's still possible.

If you wanted to give me bitcoin I'd gladly accept it. And I can tell a real bitcoin from a fake one. Heck even Chase CEO would take bitcoins. The process is technical but the concept of how the blockchain works isn't. Understanding why bitcoin transfer can be confirmed by others and viewed by everyone requires some intelligence but I wouldn't call it too technical. I wouldn't have an idea what it is if it was that technical.

Also, if you transfer the coins you want to spend to an exchange like Gemini and then spend them from your wallet there there will be 0 fees for both transactions. It's limited though, I think 30/month are free then they start applying fees.Easier way would be send money to the exchange, buy the coins and then spend.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:23:46
Good idea, but I think I'll use the GDAX option because I prefer to buy the coins 1st instead of replenishing. So an exchange would be more convenient.

@_date: 2017-10-27 06:28:17
I think bitcoin has value for many reasons. But to address your question, it has value because people believe it does and because it's rare. People used sea shells in areas where it was rare as money in the past just because it was rare. Sure, there are speculators who would panic and abandon bitcoin when it drops sharply, but the bitcoin community which is growing everyday will not. I'm far from being an expert in bitcoin but I love the concept and I'm not abandoning it.

It's not even about tech. It's about common sense. Their Bitcoin guy had no answer to the "no one accepts bitcoin as a payment. They instantly exchange it to Fiat" claim by their gold expert in a debate on gold vs. bitcoin. He just insisted they do accept it. Anyone with some common sense could've told him "no one accepts gold as a payment either". I don't need high tech skills to understand the concept of bitcoin. I'm very ignorant on a lot of features and technical problems but I know the idea that we need an 8000 number is beyond silly.

@_date: 2017-05-09 01:24:45
I thought so too. I'm a noob and I still use an online wallet with 2FA enabled. I'm not sure how someone can steal my coins when every log in has to be verfied by my e-mail and phone, but again I don't know much about these things. Still, I won't switch to a hard wallet until my coins are worth enough to invest the time and money.

True Arabs should get rid of Islam, as should every nation get rid of every religion, but to discount the contribution of a civilization makes no sense and serves no purpose. Counter these facts if you can:
1- We still use Arabic numerals.
2- Half of the stars that are named have Arabic names.
3- Algorithm was discovered by a Muslim.
4- Algebra was discovered by an Arab.
5- Arabs discover the 0.
There's more but I'll stop here.
You're entitled to your opinions but...
Islam started as a violent radical movement but at some point Arabs/Muslims got too rich and too cultured (as a result of contact with other civilizations) that they enjoyed reading more than fighting. Sadly that lasted for only 300 years.

Also, in my line of work I've encountered a lot of angry customers who couldn't make a purchase due to the daily limit and had to call the bank while waiting at the store to get it resolved.

True about the volatility. I'm not in crypto just for the speculation though. Sure it would be nice if it appreciates but even if it doesn't I'll still use it as long as the development continues. Also, I'm not sure that if it loses volatility it would become unattractive. Precious metals are still attractive to a lot of people. One other thing is that if it becomes stable it becomes more viable as a currency. I can't tell the future price or utility but I think Bitcoin has the potential to make a change and I want to be a part of that.

Valid point regarding losing your password. There're ways to recover it though but you'd need to either be good with computers or pay a fee to have someone do it for you. Still, I agree it's a hurdle that probably needs to be addressed.

Incorrect. It happened between 800-1100, about 150 years after Islam enslaved Arabs and others. Anyways, let's remember that this is r/Bitcoin and end this unproductive discussion about history and politics.

Seriously?? MAGA and populist are very similar to Bitcoin communities? Populists breed authoritarians. Look at your buddy Trump. I he has his way not only Bitcoin would be banned, any critic would be jailed or worse.

Very interesting. I need to do more reading on economics, because that "labor is the only currency that matters" is something novel (to me) yet very hard to dispute. Can you please elaborate on why companies like Netflix would love LN?

Think remittance market and transferring money from countries like China. Also if I'm travelling to another country I can transfer as much money I'd like without even carrying anything, not even a wallet.

I have some but it's not an investment. Got them in Iraq. And yes, you're right but it's not the majority. There're some in this reddit who believe in conspiracy theories and so I wouldn't be surprised if they have Dinars and/or silver. Not saying silver is worthless but a lot of people bought it because they read somewhere that it's going to skyrocket soon. The Iraqi dinar is a terrible investment, mainly because of the high premium.

It will get confirmed sooner or later. As for the temporary address, I had the same issue once. After the transaction was confirmed, I sent a message to the merchant with the address I sent the coins to and the issue was resolved.

What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:56:43
This. OP goal seems to be frustrating "opponents" rather than trying to address their concerns in an honest way. Also, interesting that OP separates Neo-Nazis from terrorists. 
Arguments like these don't help nocoiners understand why Bitcoin is good.

"white nationalist" forum is 2nd to the left. This one is about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:10:07
The reason why Bitcoin was created isn't necessarily why it may become a global currency. It's an evolving project. Satoshi is clearly a genius but even he can't control the future of Bitcoin or the reason why people may accept it. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 07:53:06
Thanks man!

Here's one way it's better: you can't counterfeit Bitcoin. Here's one more: it's much easier to transfer across borders,

Nothing wrong with that. I buy old silver coins whenever I find a good deal because I'm a collector.  Iraqi Dinar though, not so much. Not right now anyway. I did buy it when it was $1 to 2500 Dinar and got out with a more than decent profit when it hit $1 for 1170 Dinar. It's not going to happen again, unless oil prices skyrocket. The Iraqi government is too dysfunctional that it's amazing the Dinar is still somewhat stable.

I appreciate your point but I do think it's a little different than regular internet banking. No daily limits, no forms to fill and no questions asked if you want to access/transfer a large amount of money. I'm not sure if there's any internet banking method that allows you to transfer and then spend large amounts of money in any country you choose without limits or fees. Currency exchange fees are another issue that you wouldn't need to worry about if you use Bitcoin in a country where Bitcoin is widely accepted.

You is not WE. I, and many others, use Bitcoin for our own reasons. And yes Bitcoin has many practical uses and I don't why you're not aware of them. You're free to believe in your BS ideology but you can't tell us how or why we should use Bitcoin. Take conspiracy theories out of Bitcoin.

I watched one of his interviews. The host destroyed him without even trying. He's certainly well educated but a very conflicted and inconsistent man who seems to have his conclusions set in advance and is having trouble connecting the dots. No thanks, if Bitcoin is going to associate with someone it should be based on integrity, not the number of followers (way less than Hitler's followers btw).
@_date: 2018-12-10 04:28:40
So, when where you diagnosed? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 03:34:53
That logic is flawed in several ways. Bitcoin can and is being used by a lot of people in countries with very high inflation rates. It's being used to transfer money across borders without permission/limits/high transfer fees. It's being used in online gambling. Some small and mid size businesses not only accept it but actually offer a discount when you pay with it, because it saves them credit card fees. It has value because of that and many other reasons including the fact that many people think it has value. Also that car/plane comparison misses the point. Bitcoin is more like the engine that was used in cars and later developed to move planes. I think you need to research something before bashing it.

What about the software that allow you to view/listen to those things? What about anti-virus? Can you see it, smell it or touch it?
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:25:20
I think you're confused. I'm not talking about changing anything. I'm talking about a use case. I bet you that taxi driver cares about lower fees more than anonymity. The notion that "freedom" rather than a practical use is the way to sell Bitcoin to the world is silly.

I don't understand why some folks think this is bad news. At the very least it provides an answer to noncoiners who claim Bitcoin has no use case
