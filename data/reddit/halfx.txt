PSA: Stop dreaming about Greece adopting bitcoin or any other crypto as a parallel currency. 
It makes the community look naive and desperate. 
It is obvious that the Greek FinMin Varoufakis doesn't know what he is talking about since he suggests a centralized crypto...

A full node relays transactions/blocks to other nodes/miners. A miner is a special node that runs a mining software that adds/creates the blocks on the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:47:57
It will never happen because such a change will undermine bitcoin per se.
What might happen is an increase in divisibility but i guess even that requires a hard fork so i don't know if it worths the trouble.

How about stop making bitcoin look flaky and awkward.

Given all the discussion around max block size i have some hard fork related questions.
1.Which are the steps needed for a succesful and painless hard fork? 
2.Does it require any level of coordination between large pool and/or full node operators? 
3.How likely is it for you to die from a heart attack during the first hours of the fork?

Yeah and while you do that, you 'll also have the management of the company.
What's your plan for those that aren't going to agree to your "rolling up your sleeves" strategy?
They 'll claim their money from you. Are you going to pay them?

No it's not. You could try if you want to play around with the mining software/pools etc. but you would risk to damage your laptop. You can't make any profit with desktop/laptop mining anymore...

When you allow bitcoin vs doge threads is like placing bitcoin and doge in the same league.
Those who want to pump Doge know that.
moderators apparently not.
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:53:01
If a newcomer sees a "bitcoin vs doge" top voted post what do you believe he 'll think?
Best case scenario: That bitcoin and doge are in the same league.
Worst case scenario: That bitcoin and doge are something like visa and mastercard (common scam coin argument)

When you say "I 'm not Satoshi Nakamoto" the obvious response is "Prove it. Show yourself".
Obviously Satoshi knows that so he may be ready to reveal his true identity.

Bitcoin is not a company or a product or a multi level marketing scheme. 
Imho superbowl commercials or any commercials whatsoever add confusion and probably make bitcoin look sketchy...
Obviously there are a lot of speculators among us that just can't wait to get rich but this is not what bitcoin is about...
I 'm hoping for everyone here to become rich as a reward for being an early adopter of an amazing technology but in the meanwhile get my downvote ;)

LastPass doesn't know your master password. They use a one way hash of your master password for authentication.
Unfortunately i guess that they can always serve malicious code when you try to login through their website and capture the actual master password instead of the hash...

Before you answer you should consider that bitcoin isn't going to be around in 2 years if we stick to 1mb blocks.

Which means that there is no correlation between the downward price movement of recent months and the overall mining power.
Speculators are making short-term bets, miners are in for the medium-term and VCs are in for the long term.
Everyone though is acting irrational and emotional since we are 100% in uncharted waters.
