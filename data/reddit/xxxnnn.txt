Bruce Fenton is a clown. This turn of events only makes me want to see the Bitcoin Foundation fail even more. This guy has no idea what he's doing and he should not have been put in this position. I am a paying member of the foundation and I want to know how we can vote this moron out. I never voted for him, and he lost the last election, so clearly most members don't want you here Bruce. Take the fucking hint and quit trying to weasel your way into a place where you don't belong.

I agree that is an advantageous thought process for a Bitcoin developer to have, but this statement is nothing more than "clickbait". All he is saying is that he expects further regulation. I think everyone agrees on this. I don't know Peter personally, but it seems as though he is developing a bit of an ego. I don't think it's all his fault, but rather the fault of the high school mentality that perversely invades the subreddit. Both Peter Todd and Andreas A..............whatever his last name is, seem like intelligent people, but they say a lot of dumb shit too. People upvote what they have to say with out critically thinking about what they're actually saying. No one is right 100% of the time, and when people start treating these otherwise normal people as celebrities, far too much credit is given to their opinions.

I think the fact that none of the shareholders have sold on the secondary market yet shows they still believe their investment has a value above the current market price. It indicates they're long term investors. How is that a failure?
