It moves due to free market supply and demand having a bigger effect because the market liquidity for BitUSD isn't on the exchanges you are using. Sometimes BitUSD is more desirable (bear market), sometimes it is less desirable (bull market). When it is less desirable, the premium due to competing buyers will fade away.

It's a chicken and egg problem (liquidity begets liquidity) as well UX problem, sprinkle in market rules that have dis incentivized shorting BitAssets into existence and it becomes clear why BitUSD isn't as tightly pegged as is possible.
Thankfully we have the BitAsset 2.0 system launching with BitShares 2.0, which allows any BitAsset holder to force settlement at the feed price, providing them with instant liquidity.
You can read about the mechanics here:

At the end of the day, BitUSD is a trust-minimized stable cryptocurrency with potential systemic risk (Black Swan event), NuBits requires 3rd party trust in custodians, has no block chain enforce backing collateral, and nothing forces custodians to prove their solvency.

NuBits also retain the counterparty risk that bitUSD does away with, as you must rely on the custodians to maintain the peg.
BitUSD uses free market forces entirely to peg the currency, hence the approximation. Also in a thin market (bitUSD is most liquid on the bitshares exchange itself), you see much larger spreads. So the fact that shapeshift is an extra hop through thin markets exacerbates the issue.

Actually, it's backed by 3x BTS which is locked up in on chain as collateral (2x from the short position, 1x from the long). As long as BTS maintains a value, bitUSD is backed by a "bucket" of BTS worth more than 1 USD.

There's no fiat to hold. bitUSD isn't an IOU for a real USD; rather, it's a "bucket" representing the value of 1 USD backed by BTS as collateral. No counterparty risk (shady fiat holder) involved.
@_date: 2014-11-18 04:58:41
Another thing to note. BitShares uses [DPOS]( a consensus system whereby delegates (block signers) are hired via stake approval voting. The delegates publish feeds to update the current price of each market issued asset in terms of BTS. The median of these feed prices is the price at which shorts can execute. This mechanism allows the price to adjust as BTS rises and falls.

I agree with your analysis of derivatives in traditional markets. Just look at all of the CDO junk that the banks were peddling to plummet the U.S. economy into a recession in 2008. 
However, I think that derivatives on a blockchain are a wholly different beast. Open source software is completely transparent compared to the inner machinations of Wall Street corruption. 
I believe that having an asset with all of the advantages provided by a decentralized blockchain, 10 second confirmation speeds, no counterparty risk, which can approximate the value of real world commodity, will be very useful for facilitating trade. Another cool aspect of bitUSD is that holding a BitAsset such as bitUSD nets the holder a variable % yield based on how active the market is (collected into a reserve fund from market fees). BitShares gives you the financial services of a saving account but instead of the banks, you hold the key to your money.
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:03:04
It isn't the amount of the drop but rather the velocity of the drop that could lead to a black swan. The internal market can adjust with a persistent downtrend but flash crashes could potentially lead to a uncollateralized BitAssets.

@_date: 2014-12-14 01:51:54
Good question!
When the price of a BitAsset (bitGOLD for example) is going up that means the price of BTS is declining. When a buyer and short seller take positions on each side of the CFD to create bitGOLD on the internal BTS market, a margin order is created. Margin orders have call prices, representing the price of BTS / bitGOLD that will automatically trigger a margin call, covering the short. Covering destroys the bitGOLD and unlocks the position, releasing the collateral. The call price is initially set at the price by which 75% of the collateral would be required to buy back the bitGOLD, but you can add more collateral to your position if you want. 5% of the remaining collateral is kept as network fees.
@_date: 2014-11-18 03:01:42
The BitShares exchange is on the BitShares blockchain, so yes while you have to trust that the market rules are sound at least you can audit them yourself. The repository can be found [here]( 
You could say that any blockchain has a single point of failure if you're talking about a possible catastrophic flaw or exploit in the logic of the system.

I don't fully buy the argument that paper puts forward. While the article is correct that checkpointing is necessary to prevent NAS, it is possible to do checkpointing in a decentralized manner by getting a majority of the active delegates to sign off on the checkpoint.

Explaining how BitShares works is shilling? Okay then.
@_date: 2014-10-02 11:04:22
A system like BitSharesX can provide variable % yield (aka "interest") on your assets. The yield mechanism works not by inflating the supply, but rather a reserve fund that comes from market fees. By holding bitBTC you are actually provided with a way by which you can receive an return of 1.5% (currently) which is not unlikely increase to 5% or more when the decentralized BTSX market volumes pick up, on your BTC holdings. Considering that the market peg is working well even at low volumes, I think that this will be a viable option for stable gains on crypto assets in the future.
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:50:15


By that logic, Bitcoin has USD backing because someone is willing to trade USD for it?
You could create USDCoin but it's the fact that bitUSD has BTS held by the market on chain as collateral backing it that allows it to maintain a price of approximately 1 USD.
Fiat on / off ramps are just icing on the cake, but not required to have a decentralized asset that tracks the value of the USD. External price feeds on the other hand are used to adjust creation of new bitUSD to the current valuation in terms of BTS.

Closing the loop on the crypto economy to keep more value from exiting crypto money into fiat money will alleviate the downward pressure on BTC and other useful blockchain enabled technologies. 
One way traders can support the crypto ecosystem is by hedging risk due to price volatility from within the crypto ecosystem. [BitAssets]( such as [bitUSD]( or [bitCNY]( can be used as a more stable store of value without the inherent counterparty risk one is exposed to by using centralized services.
@_date: 2014-11-18 13:58:30
I never said it was backed by an actual USD... it functions like a "bucket" which represents the value of 1 USD. It is issued on a decentralized market located on the BitShares blockchain. BTS are locked up in the market as collateral. No central company or issuer required... only for on and off ramps between real USD and bitUSD, which are in the works. But you could use bitUSD completely without such a ramp as long as there were merchants accepting it. Even without merchant adoption yet (mobile, web, and shopping cart solutions are in the works to enable this) one can use bitUSD today to hedge your risk without having to exit to actual USD via Coinbase / Circle.


@_date: 2014-11-18 01:15:31
bitUSD is issued in a decentralized manner. 
The BitShares exchange backs bitUSD by BTS collateral provided at least 2x by a short position and 1x provided by the long (bitUSD buyer) for a minimum of 3x collateral locked up for each bitUSD. If due to BTS price fluctuation, 75% of the backing collateral would be required to cover the bitUSD, the margin order is called and the bitUSD is automatically covered (i.e. destroyed). 
Thus, the bitUSD supply expands and contracts based on demand to hold bitUSD.
@_date: 2014-11-18 01:38:40
Lol ok, you do realize that bitreserve could classify as the "shady fiat holder" you were just rallying against, right? Bitreserve acts as the counterparty and holds reserves that could potentially be seized.
One of the most useful aspects of bitUSD IMO is the fact that you can maintain privacy with it. I'm going to guess that bitreserve will require that you to comply with KYC / AML laws and provide your identity to use their service.
@_date: 2014-11-18 01:00:34
Thanks for your opinion! Why do you believe all derivatives are scams?
Also, realcoin looks to be backed by 1 USD held in reserve which isn't the same as bitUSD because the reserves must be held by a centralized entity, whereas bitUSD is backed by BTS locked up as collateral on the decentralized BitShares exchange.
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:08:35

So long as sources of pricing data for those commodities are available you could. The problem with bitCAR or bitHOUSE is that they are far too generic. Houses and cars range vastly in price.
bitTeslaModelS? Maybe...
The point is, you need something of value to back the asset. In the case of BitAssets, the collateral is 300% of the value of said commodity in terms of BTS.

Just because you don't want to hedge into a relatively stable cryptocurrency doesn't mean that other Bitcoiners won't see the value. Maybe you should try learning a little tolerance, then you could recognize a good thing when it's right in front of you? This bolsters the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. Rather than going back into the old system and dumping BTC for fiat, you can hold that value in a DECENTRALIZED relatively stable asset and support closing the loop on the crypto economy. 
It isn't about "BTC / BTS to da moon!!!11!1!", it's about maturing the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole by providing new valuable services. A decentralized exchange that you can use TODAY is just that; a valuable service that gives Bitcoiners more choice.
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:43:51
There's plenty of utility. We're talking about a system unlike any other that lets you mitigate risks that to this day everyone had to just accept. Such as the risks taken when you put your BTC on a centralized exchange and hope they don't default or lose it to theft while your money is there. Orderbooks on the blockchain are a huge step forward. 10 second block times make it seem as natural as using a centralized exchange. Next time BTC bubbles, move it into an asset like bitGOLD so you can hedge your investment as the bubble bursts. Then you'll see the utility.
Just because it is still in beta and the stable 1.0 version hasn't been released yet doesn't mean that it isn't a useful application.
BTS was allocated 50% to PTS (a minable PoW token at the time) snapshotted on February 28th 2014, 50% to AGS which was an ICO fundraiser. Now delegates can be voted in and paid for their contributions to the project. You can follow the supply graph of BTS [here](
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:35:34
You'd could likely use the GatewayUSD as a pass through to bitUSD by trading that pair on the market in the BTS client if you are looking to be free from a single point of failure other than an irreversible blockchain exploit (i.e. no counterparty risk). In this way your exposure to the risk would be minimal, only while you were waiting for your orders to be filled from GatewayUSD to bitUSD.
 On and off ramps that allow for a conversion into and out of fiat have yet to be operational, those are the missing link for purchasing GatewayUSD like IOUs. And the gateway is likely accountable for the strict KYC laws still, which is why they would issue their own IOU user issued asset that they control to keep track of their own ledger. Ideally an on ramp that goes directly into bitUSD would be preferred, but it all depends on having high liquidity and low spreads in the markets to make that feasible. 
I'm not an expert so I wouldn't take my statements to be fact, just my own interpretation of how this might work.
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:21:13
What you are referring to is for user issued assets so that companies that wish to be a gateway can comply with KYC / AML. Not every UIA issuer has to have these permissions; an issuer can revoke the ability without being able to change the permissions level again. So this is a feature in that it allows businesses to use the ledger and have control over their asset if they wish, but the set of UIAs with this permission is a subset of all UIAs. Also, no such permissions exist for market issued assets which are issued on the blockchain like bitUSD. So there is still no counterparty risk when using those assets in the client.
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:26:36
Automated margin calls prevent market issued assets like bitUSD and bitGOLD from becoming under-collateralized except for major flash crashes unlike any that has happened to date in Bitcoin. The shorts will unwind before they become under-collateralized. 
Just a heads up before you give more oversimplified reasons why you think BitShares sucks.
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:02:29
The only way you can hedge your risk in a stable crypto asset and be in complete control of your funds without counterparty risk are with [market issued assets]( like bitUSD and bitGOLD. You hold the private keys. The market rules are baked right into the BTS protocol. Your assets are backed by collateral on the BTS blockchain.
NuBits currently works as a hedge as well but the problem is that you must rely on an anonymous custodian to redeem your NuBit token for $1 on a centralized exchange. The exchange can be hacked and your funds lost or stolen, also the custodian could become insolvent with the dropping BTC price and decide to stop redeeming NuBits. Recently the NuBits peg was reported broken on CCEDK due to some error, possibly with the custodian's liquidity bot. I don't know the details but this is what I have read.
There is no collateral held for a NuBit, only faith that you can redeem it for $1. I am not trying to make their project look bad or anything, those are just the facts.

TST is more than a social club, it is a non-theistic religious organization bent on self-empowering activism.
 From the Satanic bible by LeVey (this book is a bit over the top, almost an overcompensation insofar as "shock value" goes, probably because nothing like it had been written before):
"The semantic meaning of Satan is the 'adversary' or 'opposition' or the 'accuser'. The very word 'devil' comes from the Indian word *devi* which means 'god'. Satan represents opposition to all religions which serve to frustrate and condemn man for his natural instincts. He has been given an evil role simply because he represents the carnal, earthly, and mundane aspects of life.
Satan, the chief devil of the Western World, was originally an angel whose duty was to report human delinquencies to God. It was not until the 14th century that he began to be depicted as an evil deity who was part man and part animal, with goat-like horns and hooves. Before Christianity gave him the names of Satan, Lucifer, etc. the carnal side of man's nature was governed by the god which was then called Dionysus, or Pan, depicted as a satyr or faun, by the Greeks. Pan was originally the 'good guy', and symbolized fertility and fecundity."
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:41:49
Unlike the Church of Satan, the original Satanic organization founded by LeVey, The Satanic Temple doesn't collect membership dues, and anybody is free to join. TST is working to forward women's rights, questioning religious dogma and promoting tolerance, and other causes. Any donations really help us continue to fight the good fight for liberty.
They have also commissioned a statue of Baphomet to be displayed alongside the 10 commandments statue at the Oklahoma statehouse. Baphomet represents balance; good and evil, male  and female, law and chaos. It is a pretty powerful statement next to the 10 commandments.
 
@_date: 2015-04-30 17:19:40
It says right on the TST site:
"We understand the Satanic figure as a symbol of man’s inherent nature, representative of the eternal rebel, enlightened inquiry and personal freedom rather than a supernatural deity or being."
Somehow they still manage to be Satanists without believing in supernaturalism. Imagine that!
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:21:27
BitUSD has lower counterparty risk. Rather than acting as an IOU for dollars held by a traditional company, bitUSD acts as a blockchain enforced derivative contract, backed by bitshares (BTS) as collateral. The BitShares DAC issues bitUSD on the market when a short position seeking leverage matches a long position seeking stability (bitUSD).
I for one would like to see TUSD / ƀUSD pairs to trade between the two assets as a gateway.

You can use bridges like Shapeshift to go between BTC and BitUSD. Same idea with Meta Exchange for bitBTC to BTC conversions, with more trading pairs on the way. 
I think BitShares has a lot to offer Bitcoin because trading on a decentralized exchange reduces exposure to counter party risk, which has been burning a lot of exchanges lately. Just look at excoin and bter.
You can think of BitShares as a decentralized Ripple. A gateway network that isn't controlled by a single company and hires delegates to sign blocks approved by BTS holders. It also issues market pegged assets backed by collateral instead of strictly IOUs.

You aren't trusting a 3rd party if the bitGOLD is in your wallet.

Not just a solution to the volatility problem, but a decentralized Forex market.
A remittance solution's wet dream! 
A new way to facilitate human organization, organized around the optimal incentive structure.
Stock issuance that can comply with AML / KYC, so when the paradigm shifts all of the centralized exchanges have a way into the blockchain as well, as gateways. But separate from your personal rights to trade market issued BitAssets.
Energy efficient blockchain security with order of magnitude faster confirmations.
A bank-less financial solution that is more efficient and returns the profits back to the BitAsset holders. Receive yield on your bitGOLD. Don't mind if I do!
HOLD THE PEG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sorry, BitShares has me really bullish lately and sometimes I get too evangelical. Please excuse me while I update my portfolio.

It seems there are quite a few competitors in your space, such as BitReserve and BitGold, Inc. 
I think the first of these offerings to move into offering real decentralized [bitGOLD as a gateway] ( on the BitShares decentralized exchange will triumph over the others. Especially if you redeem the bitGOLD for physical and enable the parity between digital and physical via your platform. In fact I know there is at least one platform in the works to do this for bitSilver to real silver.

bitGOLD isn't backed by real gold. It approximates the value of the gold price really well in a free market, backed by an initial 300% BTS that is locked on the bitshares blockchain as collateral. You can read how market pegged assets work [here]( Because it follows the value of gold well, it may be enticing for companies that deal in real precious metals to trade for bitGOLD at a parity or low spread. As Dan outlines [here]( bitGOLD can be used in this manner to form a distributed metals bank across a coalition of pawn shops all while avoiding fiat regulation.
Also for some answers to questions a first time bitGOLD buyer check out this [thread](

Glad to see some more bitasset markets opening... nice and simple UX too. Looking forward to the mobile wallet integration so bitUSD can be exchanged for BTC at the point of sale easily.

This is misleading. The transactions aren't fully anonymous. You can read more about how privacy on BitShares works [here](

There are bitcoin gateways in development which enable BTC trading pairs on BitShares decentralized exchange.

BitAssets can be created for any asset prices can be obtained for. A basket of currencies included. So bitSILVER, bitGOLD, bitOIL, etc. can appeal to different demographics.
