Interesting, especially in light of the factthat email is a broken protocol that has nevcer been fixed. We have known its a broken protocol since at least the early 90s. Its ridiculously easy to spoof email addresses. Thats why spam has been an on-going problem for the past **20 YEARS!**
It is also quite easy to invent a new protocol that doesn't allow spoofing of addresses (or at least makes it much harder). In fact i think its already been invented. But for whatever reason a new secure system was never brought in. 
So the idea that bitcoins problems will be solved *just like we solved emails problems* is completely and totally incorrect and based on a severe ignorance of the internet.

Gmail can still be tricked by spoofing. It does a good job of catching the mass spammings, but if someone targets you specifically its going to get thru.

I have spoken to the police officer, what he actually said was "Ahh yes, Bitcoin, that capricious cryptocurrency... but surely you don't suggest this upstanding citizen is involved in such diabolical shenanigans?" And then he chuckled to himself stared off into space.

So is there a limit to how "popular" bitcoin can get before it starts breaking down or becoming unwieldy? If so, isnt this a problem?

Can anyone tell me honestly why anyone would use bitcoin at a subway? Doesnt the seller have to wait 10 minutes to confirm the bitcoin got transferred? How does the seller know what price to set in bitcoins given that the price fluctuates so much? (im not being negative, just asking some questions). 
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:21:47
It's not a "scam" but it is a market game for nerds. Its not an actual currency that large numbers of people use for anything at all. Its extremely difficult for new average users to buy bitcoins and figure out how to use them. In fact, i dont know a single person in my family or at work who i could explain bitcoin too and they would be able to buy some and use them. Not a single person. Bitcoin is **years** away from being even remotely usable by the general public. 
So enjoy your market trading game, but dont expect anyone outside the clique to consider it anything other than that. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:57:44
Agreed. Don't sell... Buy more if its hits 300 or something. But don't sell.

It means governments cant just print more whenever they want. So it is deflationary not inflationary. Bitcoin are very similair to gold. You can even mine them. But like gold there is a finite amount of it available to mine.

So you had to provide the password to your bank account to get verified on coinbase? Isn't that completely crazy?
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:18:42
No, it can not. For example,. if I want to buy an apple, i give the fruit seller 50 cents and he gives me an apple. It's simple, straightforward, and the coins are essentially anonymous. 
Want to buy an apple with bitcoins? Good Lord help us! First of all, you both need computers and you both need to make sure they dont have any viruses or malware on them. ( You know you're moms computer that has 30 toolbars installed and Lord knows what else? yeah, she can never use bitcoins because they would all be stolen by hackers. And yet, she can buy apples from fruitsellers with no issues) Then i need to bring a mobile device and scan the fruitsellers public key. If i forgot my android i cant buy an apple that day. Now he needs to login to his wallet and confirm the funds got transferred (this takes 10 minutes). Does that seem like a practical system to you?
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:05:43
Bitcoin ATMs will make this obsolete. You put fiat in anonymously and cash out bitcoin anonymously.

No. The only point of an "offline" computer is to insure it doesn't have viruses on it.

A month ago it was ~175. 
2 weeks ago it was ~275 
Now it's ~ 575 
You can wait for a "crash" that may never come, or you can buy in now.

You could make a new type of email protocol. You could even fix some of the weaknesses in email like make it impossible to spoof an address. It would eliminate 99% of spam email and phishing attempts immediately. Email is used by billions of people so it would likely be worth whole to make this new email system if it was only adopted by 0.1% of the population. 
So where is this new email system? Why is no one making it?
I think you REALLY underestimate how hard it is to replace a widely adopted technology with a new better technology. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:45:24
I think you should explain the drawbacks:
1. Its way too complicated to learn and use. The basics are not too bad. But all the wallet software uses different systems and different terminologies. And security, like cold storage, is overly complicated (installing linux on a usb? thats never going to be adopted by the mainstream). There just too many different ways to do everything so it becomes confusing for newbs. 
2. The fees are outrageous (going up to 50cents per transaction)
3. Getting bitcoin on an exchange can require an extreme invasion of privacy, with some people even giving their real banking password to the exchange which the exchange uses to login as them. 
4. Security is terrible because you have to trust a bunch of random websites and software made by random people with no way for ordinary users to verify anything. And if you get a virus on your computer its all compromised anyway. And if it gets stolen you have no chance of ever getting it back and when you ask for help people on the forums will laugh at you, tell you you are stupid and that it's your own fault you got robbed. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:47:37
One of the problems is, those "average users" will want their coins back if they forget their password and loose their wallet. They will want a refund if they get scammed by an unscrupulous seller. Theres a reason everything has an undo button and OSes ask you 3 times before they actually delete anything. Because most users freak out if they dont. Bitcoin is awesome for nerds who know what they are doing. But its a nightmare of complexity and risk for average users. 
Just to illustrate, someone here was asking for a good place to create a wallet, and the answer told him to check the source code for the website and see if the javascript  had a good randomization algorithm. Seriously. Does my grandpa know how to do that?
That anyone can think bitcoins is even remotely ready for the general public is beyond imagination.

I agree. And also signing up new merchants when they may not even see that many people using bitcoin could have a reverse effect. They could spend a lot of time setting up this new system, then no one uses it and they form a bad opinion of bitcoin. Then 5 years from now when it really is more ready to be used, they just says "yeah i tried that and it didnt work". 
I remember as a university student in 1996 trying to get local business to have a website. I was charging like $150 for a simple site. Spent my whole summer going around trying to get business, but no one wanted a website. They had no need for one at that time.

It's difficult. Its definitely a bubble. But i thought it was a bubble 2 weeks ago. I was telling people it would crash at 450. Others thought it would crash at 300 or 500. Only the crazies kept saying *"straight to the moooon!"* said it would keep going up. So here we are, 2 weeks later and its at 800 and only the crazies were right. All of the sensible people were dead wrong. 
So my advice? Buy one bitcoin. (If you can afford it. Or put a decent amount in, like $500.) Then you've bought in, if bitcoin goes to 1 million you made a fortune, and if not, c'est la vie. 
Then wait for a crash  (which every sensible thinks will happen, so it probably won't) and if it ever does, buy in big time. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:26:15
 He has obviously stolen them and the total amount of money he got from everyone is $3 million. But you willingly donated it without a contract so it will be very difficult to get it back. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:34:33
That's crazy. 
One of things I like about bitcoin is it doesn't require me to trust strangers with my money. 
I've never even linked my bank account to paypal (which doesnt require your banking password), i sure won't ever link it to some sketchy bitcoin exchange that requires my password.
