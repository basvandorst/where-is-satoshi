What evidence or logic do you have to support this claim?


On what basis do you support this claim?  Are you saying the extra memory usage of orphaned blocked and the little bit of wasted bandwidth are so detrimental that they outweigh the benefits of knowing probable confirmed blocks sooner?  If so, on what basis do you claim that?


How on earth can you claim different implementations is *bad* for distributed consensus?


Voting is an optional programmable protocol for certain use cases that cannot be otherwise achieved.  How does that relate to POW consensus?  If it's not in the consensus mechanism itself, then on what basis do you claim it affects the core consensus protocol?
And by all means, if you have a way to achieve by consensus the various thing that voting sets out to achieve, post about it and submit a pull request.


In order to make that argument first you have to actually show that they are poor decisions.  You're merely decreed they are without backing those statement.


What does that sentence even mean?  I would claim it's not even possible to know what bitcoin does without understanding *how* it does it.  The two are completely intertwined.

That sounds like a whole lot of not his problem, and a whole lot of other people's problems.
You are free to not use the software Gavin writes, to check the changes on github before compiling it yourself, to use old clients, to use alternative clients, to fork the code and re-write it, to use another coin, or to abandon the use of cryptocurrencies altogether.
Those are all ways in which you can have to trust Gavin significantly less.
The way you "vote Gavin out" is by not using the software he writes.  You are completely free to do that.
What you do NOT have a right to do is to tell somebody else that they owe you anything and expect them to agree.  Gavin writes software and publishes it, completely open source and completely free, and you are free to use it or not use it.  He does not owe you a goddamned thing.

The standard is somewhere between 100 and 1000 (some do 100, some look 1000 past) addresses past the last one with any transactions, and then if it finds one with a tx, another 100-1000 past that.  So it always checks so it has that amount of empty no-tx addresses before it concludes that it's done looking.  But every wallet that uses HD wallets uses them sequentially, since it's not possible from the outside to determine that they are linked.  So have giant gaps between would only happen if you are doing it manually and for some reason make big gaps.

Welcome to the club.  I had the same experience as you, three and a half years ago.  I've learned more about economics than I ever thought I wanted to know, and I'm teaching myself to program in Python.  All because of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin just consumes you.  And it never stops.  I've only recently tried to FORCE myself to take a step back and do other things with my life, because I realized Bitcoin was truly consuming all my time and I wanted to make sure I didn't neglect friends and family and living other parts of my life.
Once you understand how Bitcoin works and the various economic and computer networking problems it solves, and then you think about things like Namecoin and Bitmessage and all the 2.0 apps -- all of the other possibilities that the blockchain enables, it really genuinely consumes you to want to contribute to that space.

as people are pointing out, the timestamp may be inaccurate.  and in fact that's the entire purpose of bitcoin.  it's difficult to determine time within a narrow margin without a central authority dictating time.  remember, bitcoin is just a ledger of transactions over time, and the problem is solves is distributed time consensus.  and it doesn't even USE time at all, because there's no good way to do that.  instead it uses WORK, because you can know for sure work had to be done to find the right hash, and you know on average how long that will take.  so the "clock" is the hash-finding.
the time between blocks is always the same:  1 unit of verifiable work.

well you can sort of.  you could for example put in enough bitcoin to satisfy concerns about a price drop.  like if he thinks bitcoin could tank to $50, he might want 3000 bitcoin in the address as collateral.  or they can find an arbiter to issue USD digital tokens, like colored coins issued by bitstamp, or even just BTC-e codes.
you're right in principle, but i think in practice, there's a way to digitally satisfy his fears to any arbitrarily high threshold, short of other than bitcoin being entirely worthless.  of course, somebody taking him up on the bet might rather just meet in person and do it OP's way rather than lock up thousands of bitcoins for collateral.

Well if you weren't asking me, then you were making a statement that how much you've won or lost in the past determines whether a bet is correct or not, which is wrong.


Sigh.  Jesus.  Yes they had different cost basis-- that was the whole point of the thought experiment, to show that cost basis was completely useless.
The were in the same identical situation, which means they should theoretically do the same thing.  The fact that they got there via different routes, and thus had a different cost basis, isn't relevant to that point.  Past independent trails and all that.


There absolutely is.  Your failure to understand it doesn't mean it's not there.
If you have $100 now, you have $100 now, and what you should do with it depends on your current situation and your plans for the future.  Whether you had $50 yesterday and got another $50 or had $150 yesterday and lost $50 is completely unrelated and irrelevant to the fact that you now have $100, and is irrelevant to what the proper course of action for utilizing that $100 now in your current circumstances.  Or rather: it doesn't matter how you got there, all that matters is that you're there now, and where you go from there.


That's as correct a statement as the statement that it's right to use dollar cost averaging is a variable in investment decisions.


"Locking up profit" is another logical error.  Just like "playing with house money" is an error.  All that matters is your present circumstance and risk tolerance, and the risk and value of the investment at hand.  If cashing out of an investment is correct, the process to decide whether it's correct should not factor whether you've made money or lost money, other than for understanding how your present circumstances may have changed.


Indeed I am correct, although your sarcasm and ego will likely dissuade you from further researching our discussion and realizing it.  Much easier to just poke fun and dictate I am wrong, rather than invest time in critical reasoning.
I implore you one last time to seriously think about your argument:
Cost basis can only be determined by the past.  Past results do not have bearing on future results.  And yet somehow you claim that the past results should still be a variable in the equation for deciding the correct view of the future.
That conclusion is not logically consistent.

Do you know how to explain that concept better?  I'm arguing with a few different people about how what you paid in the past is irrelevant and all that matters is what your current situation is, and I'm still arguing with people because of my apparent inability to explain that concept.  But I don't know how to break it down any simpler.
With one guy, I gave an example of two identical people, the same in every way, expect one had previously won money and one had previously lost money, but now they had the same amount and had identical life situations.
I thought that was a slam dunk to show how they should both have the same process moving forward, and by extension, that their pasts were irrelevant.  But even that amazing example didn't work in convincing the other guy.
And I don't know how to explain it better.

the electrum seed, and the trezor one, are just "easier to remember" forms of a really big number.  you can convert back and forth.  i.e. you can convert your electrum seed into hex or into a decimal number, and convert that into a trezor seed.  and vice versa.  they are just different ways of remembering a number.
for example, the electrum (v1) word list of:
    sport flutter consider bring aim birth loss pack hopefully carefully long price
corresponds to the bip39 word list of:
    symptom riot cherry conduct jewel grit moment wet save exercise shine fine
which are both just word list representations of the hex:
    dc97449d97677ecd63bfccbfc9eb17ab
which is hex format of the number:
    293215587587852168713225966329472423851
It's all the same thing.  if you can remember one of them, and you know how to convert, or at least lookup how to convert, between them, then all you need to know is one of them.

EncFS is basically enctypion on a per-file basis.  So the file/folder structure is visible, as are the file sizes, but the files themselves, and their names, are scrambled.  So when you "mount" a folder that's encrypted like this, it shows up as a new drive, like Truecrypt does, but the changes happen to the individual files.  You can open your EncFS folder and see new files and changes and stuff.  So there's some meta-data leakage there, moreso than a Truecrypt container, but whatever, it's good enough for my purposes.  There's a program called Boxcryptor that does this-- or rather, there used to be, but now it's no longer available because they've combined it into some kind of dropbox-like storage service, and that service and the encryption app are all rolled into one horrible gelatinous blob.  If you go to their site, you don't want the main thing, you want what is now called "[Boxcryptor Classic](  Or you can pirate it, just find Boxcryptor v1.5xxxx (I forget which one is the most recent, but it's 1.5 something).
Now a lot of people on this sub are going to come running and screaming at me "ZOMG closed source, and ZOMG *pirated* closed source, you must be insane!!!" and that's fair, and my response is "yeah ok I can't prove they're secure, and yeah the cracked version might be even more insecure, I'll take my chances on the program doing what it says it's supposed to do."  BUT That being said, I did buy it legitimately and use the legit version, I did also firewall it so it never had internet access, and lastly, I don't even use it anymore.  I have switched to the [open source version](  But if you're just going to use the pre-compiled exe from the site, you might as well go for the more user friendly Boxcryptor.  The argument that the open source binary is safe is that the guy who made it is an indiviual, and a smaller operation so less likely to be backdoored -- but the flip side is, he may also be a malicious individual whereas the business entity may have more incentive to NOT be corrupt since it's their business.  You can make a case either way.  Personally, I'm just not that paranoid, and I'm sure they're both probably perfectly safe and both work just as advertized and aren't backdoored.
That open source version has two potential issues.  The first one is you have to install [this]( first, which is a program you'll just install and forget about and never see again.  It tells Windows to know how to mount the EncFS folder.  (Boxcryptor does NOT need that, because that functionality is included in the app itself.)  The next problem is that that open source one doesn't have a GUI, so you need to use the command line or [the GUI somebody make in autohotkey](  (Just download the one at the bottom of the page that has 1.0.4_bin in the name, and choose x86 or x64.)
So those are your EncFS options.  Honestly, I would just but or pirate Boxcryptor if you aren't that technically skilled.  It's really easy to use, and despite the fact that you can't be sure it's safe, there's gotta be boundaries of reason on paranoia at some point and Boxcryptor's probably fine.
@_date: 2014-09-13 01:05:58
My tool will be public when I finish some other stuff.  The part for "address fixing is really simple though.  A bitcoin address is just a base58 encoding of the hex "version byte + ripemd160(sha256(pubkey)) + checksum" where version byte is 0x00 for bitcoin mainnet, and checksum is the most significant 4 bytes of sha256(sha256()) of the previous bytes.
So let's say I have a public key of:
    03df22c00ff21b1b49e49c2d0b7bd9f10a18339218c40b140925c41d15f51b3b26
the sha256 hash of that is:
    2e5d805687e51101af9c88d40d09b7143b90d131e085768392af837e8a75e9ae
and the ripemd160 hash of that is:
    4d569f7ad43016c4ff234fb25f4b6baf41f03130
So that's the "hash160" which is what bitcoin devs call ripemd160(sha256()).  So since we're using bitcoin, we put 00 as the version byte in front:
    004d569f7ad43016c4ff234fb25f4b6baf41f03130
and then sha256 it and sha256 it again and get:
    46694e7e27f4ecdf631ef6d7279370bf70d121490589316870600354edcab1fd
the first four bytes of which are 46694e7e, so we append that at the end and get a final hex string of
    004d569f7ad43016c4ff234fb25f4b6baf41f0313046694e7e
which we convert to base58 to get the string:
    183voSY5CKc4NMacRsaMJNSdC81n9LA5Ed
which is the corresponding bitcoin address.
The term "base58 check-encode" is short hand for taking some hex and finding that double-sha256 checksum and then adding the first 4 bytes to the end and base58 encoding the entire thing including the checksum.  Bitcoin and most alts always just include the checksum part when creating any base58 string, because that allows the software to easily tell if it's been mis-typed.
So what you do to fix the checksum is just decode the base58 string back into hex, ignore and delete the checksum part completely, and then re-encode the non-checksum part with the correct checksum, and so you "fix" the checksum.
Note that this will only work if the base58 string is the correct length.  Even one char more/less changes the ENTIRE hex output, since you're not just lopping off a part of the hex when you lop off the base58 char, you're actually reducing the base58 string as a number by a power of 58, which means the hex is entirely different.
So the base58 string:
    183voSY5CKc4NMacRsaMJNSdC81n9LA5E
which is the bitcoin address without the last character, decodes to the hex:
    0001555b0688127bfa91a3eb4e1c20326889f6e65d85a0b651
which is the correct number of hex bytes for a bitcoin address, just with an incorrect checksum.  So if I tried to "fix" that address, I'd get:
    183voSY5CKc4NMacRsaMJNSdC81j6tW3w
which is in fact a valid bitcoin address, but it's NOT the correct address.  That's the address for the hash160:
    01555b0688127bfa91a3eb4e1c20326889f6e65d
instead of the hash160
    4d569f7ad43016c4ff234fb25f4b6baf41f03130
So any time you correct an address, you need to try to make sure you are using the correct number of characters in your base58 address, which is why my tool, in order to "fix" a mis-typed address, first tries to correct single and double char mis-types and then -- as a last resort -- assumes the beginning part is correct and simply updates the checksum to match.
As for how it does that, well it just iterates through every possible combination of addresses that are the same as the input except for 1 char changed, and then it decodes them and sees if the checksum is valid, and if not, moves on.  To fix two chars, it does the same thing, but with a recursion function to do a second character check for every instance of the first character change.  I stop at two chars, because more than that both takes forever, since you're exponentially increasing the number of decode/checks you have to do with each extra char, and also because the checkum is only 3-5 letters, and so the chance of an incorrect address being found due to a collision in the 4-byte checksum is great increased.
I plan to also add in the future another check to change the upper/lower case of each char, since that may be a common mistake of input and isn't that big of an extra search space.  I'll also try to think of other things that people may do to mess up an address which are easier to find, and which unlike 3+ char complete typos won't result in a substantial chance of incorrect checksum collisions.
That's kind of all you can do.  At some point, a mis-typed address simply isn't salvageable, since the checksum is only 4 bytes, so anything even approaching that level of mistake is simply so large of a search space that collisions are bound to happen and it's not possible to tell which collision is the "correct" one since they're all valid addresses.

no, those are addresses somebody has a key for.  the first 6 or 7 letters or so being readable is a vanity-mined address that likely has a private key.  if the whole thing except the last 6 letters is readable, that's a burn address.

I don't know much about how Mastercoin and Counterparty work, but with Colored Coins I know for sure you have the benefit of being able to sell them in atomic swap trades, which makes buying and selling shares in an easy trust-free manner trivially easy.  Not only can it be done directly peer to peer, but it can be done peer to peer with zero chance of fraud.  And of course, properly implemented, colored coin-based voting is super easy to do and verify.  Without knowing anything at all, I can imagine a scheme with a "yes to proposal" address and a "no" address, and transactions to each address can be made by an address which is simply the ec_multiplication of an address that holds shares, multiplied by itself, with OP_RETURN data of the address itself-- so checking that the address is the square of the OP_RETURN data is easy, and checking that the OP_RETURN address has shares is easy.  And then vote money is automatically returned back to the sending address, whether or not the vote was a valid vote.  I'm sure there's far FAR better ways to do it-- but that was just an off-the-top-of-my-head proof that this could be set up in a stupid simple way and work near flawlessly, and all completely automated.
Edit:  I know voting could be done from the colored coin address itself, but I chose the other method because I thought people wouldn't like making transactions from the same address that holds the shares, even though it's trivial to keep the share intact in the address.

that's kind of like saying cracking an 8 character password means 256 bit encryption is broken because when your key falls within the keyspace of an 8 char password, it can be quickly guessed.
if the bitcoin address is randomly generated, you have no idea whether it fall in the "weak keyspace" or not.  therefore the number of possibilities is still 256 bits.
additionally, his program cannot tell you if an address falls in the weak keyspace ahead of time, sooo... the search space is still 2\^256.

You understand correctly.  It does exactly those things.
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:24:20
basically they work because of this fact:
    pubkey1 * privkey2 = pubkey3
    privkey1 * pubkey2 = pubkey3
So two people who exchange public keys can generate a shared secret (pubkey3), which nobody else can re-create (because it always requires at least one of their own private keys).
So a stealth address is just a public key, and then somebody creates a random key and multiplies it against the stealth key to get a shared secret which they use to derive a payment address.  Then the OP_RETURN data is the public key of that new random key that the sender created, so the receiver can use his stealth private key and that public key to recreate the shared secret and generate the address.
There's also an additional step where the shared secret public key is added to a second stealth key, and then the second stealth private key is the only one that can get at the actual payment private key, so not even the sender can access the funds once he sends them.
But ya the main thing is that neat feature of ec math where both parties can generate a shared secret.

i just don't think person to person e-mails are something that the whole world needs to see and that needs to get stored permanently.  and it's a waste to use the blockchain for that, and any extra wasteful harm on the network necessarily impedes the use of good things that do really actually need the blockchain..

Actually, you do, because most of the assumptions about it don't hold water with a fixed supply of money.  It's advantageous in the current fiat system when you can spend $1 to bribe a congressman to make a law that forces people to use your business and gets you an extra $1.50, but in a free market system, no such monopolistic strangleholds exist.  You take for granted that the extra money is a benefit, but you haven't actually figured out *why*, and if you think about it, you will find that the majority of your reasons are due to how our current system works and are *not* intrinsic to the wealth differential itself.
When you are spending your $100M to run your business, you are losing an opportunity cost to make $5 million by loaning out that $100M, so your business still needs to make more than 5% to be viable.  The exact same 5% that the guy getting the loan needs it to be.  The viability of running the business is the same for both people.  Additionally, when the guy who borrowed the money fails, there's no way for the lender to recoup the loss, they're just out the money, which gets distributed amongst the vendors that the guy paid.  When the wealthy guy's business does poorly, he too eats the cost, which goes to the vendors he paid.  So when both people lose $100M, both arrive at a net worth of zero, and the only difference between them is a poor credit score.
The only actual advantage of the wealth is what I call the "life is exponential" network effect.  For example, if you don't make enough money to have a car, then the job opportunities you can take are those limited to your bus route.  Additionally, you lose an extra hour out of your day waiting for the bus and taking the bus that you wouldn't lose driving, and things like buying groceries take more time and effort.  And losing 10% of your income when you make $1000 a month means you eat less, whereas losing 10% of $10K a month means you have a moderate inconvenience.  Being poor makes it *harder to stop being poor*.  But that effect diminishes the richer you get.  For example, if Bill Gates went form having $80B to having $60B, his life would be basically unchanged.
The advantage of having money is only the advantage of what that money can buy.  In our current system, above a certain amount of money, you can buy politicians and policies that recoup the expenditure and then some.  But in a market economy, that's not true.  The cost of running a hundred million dollar business is a hundred million dollars, no matter where you get it from.  Both people in your example still need to do better than 5% for the business to be viable.  Tell me what functional distinction is there between a man who gets a $100M loan from a bank to start a company, and a man who owns the bank and uses $100M of its funds to start a company?  In both cases is the business goes bust, both the man and the bank end up with nothing, and in both cases, if the business does well, the man ends up wealthier.  The barrow pays 5% that the owner does pay -- that 5% pays the bank employees.  But the owner also has to pay those same bank employees that same 5% -- it might not be part of the business contract, but nonetheless it's still money he must spend.
So tell me, where is the functional difference there?  How is it advantageous?  You claim it is self-evident that having the money is strictly better than being able to get a loan for that same amount of money.  I claim it is not self-evident and wish you to explain your reasoning.
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:08:36
Yeah.  And you can even just re-arrange the order of the keys and have a new redeem script and new address, even though it's basically the exactly same thing.
Also, you might be interested in learning about BIP32 HD wallets.  "HD" stands for hierarchical deterministic.  In essence, you have a "wallet" which has a "master" address.  And from that you can derive other addresses.
Like for example, if you sha256 hash the private key of an address, you have a new 32 bytes hex, which can be used for a new private key.  So all you have to remember is the first private key and the algorithm of "hash each successive key to get the new key" and you can have infinite numbers of keys, and you only have to remember one key in order to backup everything.
[BIP0032]( (which stands for "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal" number 32) is a similar method of linking keys, but it allows you to prove that link with the public key as well, without compromising the private keys.
So for your example, the company could derive private keys keys for each department, and share the public keys of those with each other department, so departments could monitor each other and know which keys belonged to each department, and coordinate multisig address creation.  New keys could always be used for things, and the outside world would have no idea they were linked, but inside the company everybody would know.

the intermediate code above can be used to generate an unlimited number of encrypted private keys which only i can decrypt.  and the person creating it will also be able to know the public address, although the public address cannot be inferred from the encrypted private key.  so he can generate an address that he can see, and what i will know once i decrypt the private key, but which any public eavsdroppers cannot know just from the encrypted private key.  so it appears to me to function exactly as a stealth address.  the password used to generate the intermediate phrase is like the stealth secret, the intermediate phrase is the stealth address, and the encrypted private key is analogous to the nonce you need to give me, which i then use in combination with my secret/password to gain the information about the address and its private key.  and as i said, you can randomly generate an unlimited number of encrypted private keys from my intermediate passphrase.
the only way i think it would be different is if im wrong about the encrypted private keys and it is possible for an outsider with knowledge of the intermediate code and encrypted private key to determine the public address corresponding to that encrypted private key.  but if that's not possible, i think this is exactly the same.

Of course it was the honest thing to do.  That wasn't a prank on your part, it was a serious thread offering a bet that people took you up on, which you then lost.  The title of [your post]( was "I'm giving 100% ROI away to anyone who thinks pirate is a fraud" and the text was:














































That was clearly not a joke, and indeed you later said "Also, would someone please quote the OP so that it can't be said that I changed it later?" and you spend many days and posts in [the thread]( ironing out specific details on what constitutes a win and loss in scenarios where pirate pays out say 90% and so forth.
You were not joking.  You tried to weasel out of it plain and simple.  In the poker world (I'm a poker player), we call this scam trying to freeroll somebody.  If you win the bet, you get paid, and if you lose, you don't pay-- it's a "freeroll" for you.  And it's a scam.  You lost a bet and tried to welch on it by saying you were just joking.  **You got caught trying to scam people via freerolling, plain and simple.**

Yes, you can do what you say.
A BIP38 wallet is just a single bitcoin private key which is encrypted with a password.
(There's also a little-known part of the BIP38 protocol which allows one person to create an encrypted private key that they never had the unencrypted version of.  That way you can for example have a paper-wallet generator create encrypted paper wallets for you that you know they never had the private key for.  That's why casascius originally created BIP38, so that he could sell his Casascius Coins and his customers would know for sure he couldn't steal the funds.  It's rarely used any more now that multisig has developed.)
A multisig wallet is an address whose "private key" is actually multiple keys, and so more than 1 key is required to spend money from that address.  The most common form is 2-of-3, which means that an address created with three keys needs any two of them to spend the money.  But there are also 3-of-3 and 2-of-2 and any mix and match number of up to n-of-15, where 15 is the maximum number that the protocol currently supports (due to the size of the redeem script).
A BIP32 wallet is a bitcoin address and/or private key, with extra information added to the address which tells it how to derive addresses from it.  A BIP32 "master" address is derived, basically by hashing some data.  So that input data that gets hashed could be anything really -- including the private key from a different address.
You can mix and match any of those methods to your heart's desire.
As somebody pointed out, Coinbase does that with their "Vault".  The way the vault works is that Coinbase generates 3 private keys in your browser.  They use one of them to create a BIP32 address that they give you the public version of (and they keep the private key), they BIP38 encrypt another one with your password, and they store the encrypted version as well as the BIP32 public address.  And then the third one is yours, which you have the unencrypted private key for, and use to derive the public and private BIP32 keys.
So all three public BIP32 keys are known, and since BIP32 keys can have "child" keys derived from them, and the process is publicly known, both you and they can derive the public child keys if given the "parent" master public key.  So they create a multisig address by for example taking the first "child" address of all three BIP32 keys, and using those three child keys to create a multisig address.  And you can verify that the address is really correct without decrypting anything since the process is done using only public keys.  Then, when you log into coinbase and want to spend money from that address, they sign it using their private key, and then they stick your encrypted key in your browser cache/memory, and you decrypt it and sign the tx all in your browser cache/memory, and send them back the signed tx.  The actual user experience for the lay user just looks like they entered their password and the tx magically got signed, but the behind the scenes means that Coinbase never actually can even access those funds without the user decrypting the key.  So (assuming they aren't hacked and feeding you a malicious javascript), they CAN'T access vault funds.
You however, since you have your unencrypted private key, as well as the encrypted private key plus your password, have two of the three private keys and can thus spend the multisig money.  That way, if Coinbase goes down, you don't lose access to your money.

I'll break it down.  It's actually really simple.
    54:  This stands for OP_4, e.g. the number of sigs required.
         That is, it's the first "4" in 4-of-4
    41:  The length in bytes of the first public key.
         130 chars is 65 bytes, which is 0x41 in hexidecimal
    
    04f8bb4a6de395b21b1593dde086549801496bd4fc9c88bb351ee056049a1e4a80505b402a083ec5cc0444d096ca2db15ef3c3883e5e6e9d6a9f0caadc21ccca7f
This (04f8bb4a.....) is the first of the four public keys.  If you take the first (Raiders) private key and derive the public key, this is the public key you get.  If you sha256 hash its hex and then ripemd160 hash that result, you get the first address (in hex from not base58).
Then after that first address is:

    54:  This is the number of total keys.  The second 4 in 4-of-4.
    ae:  OP_CHECKMULTISIG.  Sees if there are the right number of signatures.
And that's the entire reddem script.  The number of keys required, then the keys prefixed by how long they are, followed by how many keys that should have been entered, followed by CHECKMULTISIG.
If you want to change that to a 4-of-7, you simply tack on more keys (prefixed by their length), and change the last 54 (third and fourth letters from the end) to a 57 to indicate 7 keys, and bam you have a new 4-of-7 address.
I will do that now.  I will create three new random keys and make a perfectly valid redeem script that takes those first four keys as the first four of seven keys listed.  See if you are able to pick out the last three and understand how it's all put together.

That's a valid redeem script.  If we sha256 hash it, we get:
    d01ce48e36f55fadf7bf9c50e47fbe95bc2752ea14259c039b677057aafecb6f
and if we ripemd160 hash that, we get:
    0d8748a219c9199faeac30b6a29474f9efb871df
Multisig addresses have a prefix of "05".  So it looks liek this:
    050d8748a219c9199faeac30b6a29474f9efb871df
Base58 encoding is just like any other base conversion.  It's no different than changing decimal (base 10) to binary (base 2).  Base 58 just uses letters in addtion to numbers to make it so a single character can represent more data.  Just like "f" is 16 in hex.  Base58 is like base-64 but without capitol O's and lowercase "L" and one or two other letters that look like other letters-- it was chosen by Satoshi specifically to make typos less likely.  Bitcoin protocol specifcation also says that you add a checksum of the data you are encoding, which means when you decode it back into hex, you can hash it and check the checksum and verify that no typos happened.  This is done by sha256-hashing the data twice, and adding the first 8 characters of the sha256 hash onto the end of the hex.  So our hex of:
    050d8748a219c9199faeac30b6a29474f9efb871df
if we hash that, and then hash that resulting hash, and then take the first 8 letters, which are "fc234468", we get a final hex of:
    050d8748a219c9199faeac30b6a29474f9efb871dffc234468
which we can convert from base16 (hex) to base58 as:
    32vYmiT181xUDecbTW3L1gk7fi7YfLfMcB
Which is the multisig address for that new 4-of-7 redeem script I made.  So any money sent to that can be spent by those same 4 private keys that were in the OP.
Also, the 05 prefix doesn't just stand for multisig.  It stands for any P2SH address, which is short for "pay to script hash".  Multisig scripts require checking and validating signatures, but other scripts can be used as well.  Any redeem script that evaluates to true when run can spend money.  For example, you could have a redeem script that simply says "TRUE" which in bitcoin scripting is "51".  That's the entire redeem script: 51.  If you do all the hashing and conversions on that, you arrive at the address of [3MaB7QVq3k4pQx3BhsvEADgzQonLSBwMdj]( which you can see actually has had transactions on it.  Anybody can spend money in that address because no signatures are required.  The script always evaluates to true.

yes the math equation is real.  its perceived usefulness is a myth.  it's no more useful than "it rained last week, therefore i should buy/sell".  that's exactly as useful as "i bought at 800 and now im buying at 400 so my average is 600."  it's a completely useless metric.
if buying now at 400 is the right decision for you and your circumstances, it will be correct regardless of what you did in the past.  and your dollar cost average doesn't make it any more or less correct.
where people get confused is that they relate their current circumstances to their past circumstances and make a decision based on that.  that's irrational and will result in worse decisions and worse outcomes than would be had if you simply attempted to objectively take stock of your current situation regardless of what you did in the past.
whether or not you bought bitcoin in the past doesn't matter with regards to whether you should buy or sell now.  your decisions should focus on the present and the future, since the river of time flows inexorably forward and the past will remain irrevocable and unchanged.  the only thing your decisions can influence is the present and the future.

Also 100% in, checking in.  This price down swing certainly sucks, but what can I say, the technology is sound and I still feel safer with my money under my complete control.  Plus it's not like I can complain, I got in in 2011, so it's still up from when I got in.
Additionally, I may be 100% in, but I don't have anybody depending on me, and I'm not spending anybody's money but my own.  If I go broke, that would suck, but it wouldn't be world ending, and it wouldn't affect anybody else except me.
Plus, what's life without a little gamble?  If it doesn't work out, that sucks.  If it does, I never have to work ever again.  Seems like a reasonable risk/reward ratio as far as I'm concerned.
Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely a bit sick to my stomach from the past few days, but intellectually I can't say that I think I made the wrong move.  I think Bitcoins are a good gamble, and a good investment.
And no matter what the price is, I believe in the technology and the good that Bitcoin can offer to the world.  Once I understood how Bitcoin worked, I was all in, and there really was no going back.

you've just described namecoin's id/ feature.  for example, if you look up the creator of [this site]( on namecoin, his name is daniel.  just as you can register domains via the "d/" prefix, you can register personal information via the prefix "id/".  so you can look him up on [his site]( or in namecoin itself.  use namecoind command line (or standard input) or the debug window in the namecoin-qt gui, and type "name_show id/daniel".  in windows, running namecoind, this is what i get when i run the command "namecoind.exe name_show id/daniel" from cmd.exe:
    namecoind.exe name_show id/daniel
    {
        "name" : "id/daniel",
        "value" : {
            "name":"Daniel Kraft",
            "nick":"domob",

    }
in fact, you can register any type of information in namecoin.  the "d/" and "id/" prefixes are known and commonly used, but you can make up your own prefix and register information in it.  just as long as the total information is less than 512 bytes it will register.  (it will actually register less than 1024 bytes, but if it's between 512 and 1024, the name_update command will fail, so you can't update it and just have to let it expire.  it's a glitch for names over 512 bytes, even though the software lets you register up to 1024 bytes.)

No, that's not quite right.  I said "properly implemented" because I didn't want to leave the door open for claiming that people get hacked all the time and thus crypto might not be secure.  That's the only reason I added that caveat, which I now regret adding.
But, using your comparison, properly implemented crypto is still far FAR more secure than properly implemented physical location hiding.
In fact, it's unimaginably more secure.  Not just orders of magnitude, but *orders* of orders of magnitude.  If it were possible to search every atom on and inside earth, heck let's say in the solar system, your cash could theoretically be found.  Obviously that's impractical, but I'm using exaggeration to make my point.  And that point is: if you did that same level of search-- with that amount of resources dedicated and the same search sapce-- you still wouldn't break the crypto.  You wouldn't even begin to start to come close.
Even if your physical location and algorithm are really good, it remains at least a possibility, however slight, that it could potentially be found.
With crypto, it's truly impossible.
(Ok, the statistician in me won't let me say impossible, since 1/(2\^256) != 0....  but again it's *orders of orders* of magnitude more secure than **any** physical scheme you can come up with.)

if you can predict what is high and what is low, you will always make money no matter what the market does.  referencing the past as being "high" or "low" is a mistake.  you should be focusing on the present value versus what you belief the future value to be.


yes, buying only a fraction of what you can afford means you are "risking less" than the maximum possible risk you can have relative to your total bankroll.  it also means you aren't full invested and thus can't reap maximum returns.
certainly, you should always invest with a mind towards balancing the returns you seek with your personal risk threshold -- but again, that's thinking about the PRESENT and the FUTURE, and *not about the past*.  what you did in the past is completely irrelevant.  the results of your past actions may move your current risk tolerance, but you're still focusing on that current risk tolerance itself, not the past actions.  the past has no bearing on what the current correct investment strategy should be.


that's incorrect.  diversifying and lowering your risk inherently yeilds a lower return, since if you are diversifying then by defintion you are not fully invested in the asset(s) you believe will yield the highest returns.  occasionally you can have the best of both worlds by investing in multiple different assets that have no relationship to each other, nor effect each other, but which yield similar returns -- but that is a rare opportunity.  99% of the time, diversifying costs money.  that's OK, because most people value not going broke above having a higher return, and you can also theoretically leverage infinite capital if you can find a zero risk investment with *any* return.  but for a set given amount of capital, lowering risk usually *costs* you money -- it certainly doesn't yield *better* returns.  this is why most wealthy people (who didn't inherit it) you'll find on average to be much higher risk takers.  risk takers either do really well or fail spectacularly, and a significant portion of rich people represent a survivor bias of a larger sample of risk-takers.


you're misunderstanding.  using the past **at all** in any context for making your investment decisions is incorrect.  you should only use the present and your estimates about the future.  now certainly what happened in the past will shape your present situation, but it's still in the past and cannot be changed and has no value other than how the lessons of the past may be of use in predicting the future.  the actual past -- or rather, what happened in the past -- is completely useless.  the average price you paid for a bitcoin doesn't matter \*at all\* with regards to what you should do currently.  only your current situation and your current risk tolerance and your current estimations of what the future holds -- those are the only things that matter.  the past does not.

you're confusing credit cards and banks with fiat.  if he had used paper money and handed it off to some 3rd party cashier who disappeared, he would be just as screwed and that transaction would have been just as irreversible.
fiat has banks and insurance companies built **on top** of it, which can easily be done for bitcoin as well.  you, like many others, see bitcoin and think it's lacking because it doesn't have those strcutures built on it, but that's the wrong view.  money itself must be irreversible.  if it's not, trade doesn't work because you can never be sure the money you got is actually yours.  so you build insurance companies and banks who act as intermediaries and offer buyer protection.  but the money itself, again, must not be reversible.  bitcoin is a transference mechanism.  the fact that people are using it at the core base level which doesn't offer such protections doesn't mean that bitcoin is flawed, it just means reputable insurance options are lacking.  the core protocol must be irreversible otherwise the whole system doesn't work.

I am rarely dishonest, and certainly have not been so in our conversation here.  You were complaining about the potential ill effects of people using third party exchanges, and I offered you a solution to your problems.  You then said "I never undertook to save bitcoin" -- i.e. you don't want to take responsibility for your problems, you want others to do that for you.
If you continue relying on others to fix your problems -- to care about you more than they care about themselves -- you are going to continually be disappointed.  I highly recommend you take a look at the PDF I linked to in the edit of my last reply to you.
Rather than heed any advice or engage in constructive debate or conversation, you've simply resorted to ad hominem attacks and digging your feet even further into the ground that you were complaining about.  I have done nothing but offer solutions to your problems.  It is bad form to bite the hand that's trying to feed you, and as I said before, you ignore the advice of your betters at your own peril.  It will be very hard for you to get along in the world if you both expect others to fix your problems and then lash out at them when they actually try.  That seems to me to be a fast way to misery.

Yeah but that's not spending money to crash a market.  That's just building a viable business and creating value.  How is that related?  You could do that with a more distributed coin too.  Imagine a system where nobody has more than 5 coins.  I could still go gather investor, come up with 20 coins, and start my business.  Additionally, part of the "fairness" of that is that sure I may get 25 coins back, but I might also fail, and those investors lose their coins, and the coins get distributed across the vendors and other people I paid without making any money back.
But again, all of that can happen regardless of distribution.  How is that related to your original concern about the distribution of coins?

Yeah, every "wallet" you use has many many "addresses" that are in it.  The way bitcoin works is that every time you are spending money, you are spending money that was sent to you, which is called an input, and 100% of an input MUST be spent-- that's part of the bitcoin protocol-- so if you send less, the transaction sends the lesser amount to the person you are paying, and the rest back to another address in your wallet.  That's how 99% of wallets works.  So whatever you're using to use Bitcoin should also control the account/address that the leftover was sent to, which means you can still spend it.
A simple example:  You control Address A.  Somebody pays you 2btc and then later somebody else pays you 3btc.  Now Address A has two "inputs", one for 2btc and one for 3btc.  So if you want to pay 1.3btc to somebody else at Address F, your wallet will figure out which input can cover it -- in this case, the 2btc input will do it -- and it will send 1.3btc to Address F, and 0.7btc to Address B.  And your wallet will have the private keys for both Address A and Address B, so you still have a total of 3.7btc that you control and can spend.  You would have to manually send the 0.7 back to Address A yourself if you wanted everything to stay in Address A.  But your wallet, which is a collection of addresses (or what you called accounts), will have the private keys for every address that has money in it.

@_date: 2014-03-13 17:25:21
You are correct that no truly decentralized exchange can directly involve fiat.  I was thinking more about crypto to crypto exchanges.
The way to mitigate this is to have an exchange that buys and sells only fiat into/out of a colored coin or coupon code or other digital token, and then the actual decentralized exchange can work with that.
That would be nice, because the fiat part is really really easy to do and it's super easy to spot problems.  There's far less accounting that needs to be done.  You just buy and sell them at the same rate, because they're fiat.
But yes, you are fundamentally correct that anything involving fiat is going to be inherently insecure, because by definition you have to involve the government/bankers/people-who-print-it, otherwise it's not "fiat".
Hopefully one day soon, crypto currencies will be popular enough that they stop being priced in terms of fiat and start just being used by themselves, and then decentralized crypto exchanges will be all that is ever needed.

Well it's hard to "put too much weight" on the only way to restore all your private keys.
That being said, I kind of agree with you-- and it's especially bad because a lot of the measures people take to secure it make them less secure.
After all, the entire purpose of using a mnemonic was so that you could *memorize* it without writing it down anywhere.
If the security model was writing it down or saving it on your computer, we'd just use base58 encoded random keys, and probably with 256 bits of entropy instead of 128.  But the whole point on mnemonics is to be able to remember them.
Bip39 was even [*designed*]( from scratch with that in mind.  They specifically didn't use Electrum's word list because they wanted to make sure the words were all dissimilar enough and didn't have like words and on and on-- all things to make sure you \*remembered\* it correctly.
If you're not committing the seed to memory and instead just writing it down, writing down the hex or base58 version of that data would take less space...

anybody and everybody.  the code is open source.  there are a few dozen guys who regularly look for bug fixes and update the client known as "bitcoin core", but bitcoin core is not the only full node, and people have to voluntarily use it and agree to its changes.  if less than 50% of people don't use that new software, those changes don't get "implemented".
you can contribute code fixes yourself and push for them to be used by people.  you can create a copy of all the code and mess with it however you want.
the mechanism by which consensus spontaneously arises is the proof of work algorithm and the hard coded standards in the software that most people use, but if you can get enough people to use your software, then yours becomes the "official" version.
the people who "control" bitcoin have sort of arisen naturally as part of the development process, but there is nobody who officially controls bitcoin.  all software updates are open source and people have to willingly upgrade to them.  if you can convince enough people to use your code, then you "control" bitcoin.
that's why bitcoin is so amazing.  it's the first method of acheiving consensus without a central controlling party dictating things.  it's the protocol that's so amazing.  the protocol which allows a set of people who dont' know each other, don't trust each other, and will not abide any authority figure -- it's a protocol for a group of THOSE people to magically agree on the state of things, without any central control.

yeah, the hashing power comes from the fact that you're randomly trying out private keys and seeing if one matches a pattern.  that's why vanity addresses are difficult to make.
but if you just want a public key pattern with no private key, you can create it on the first try with no effort.
in fact the very address you mention is specifically designed to be very clearly made that way, as proof that it doesn't in fact have a private key associated with it.
would you think im more or less likely to have the private key for 1PenisPenisPenisPenisPenisPgZREiF or for 19un73HPJ7XMii8usS8AuhRiWHK9CyuMuq?  Technically, both are equally probable, but I'm guessing you still feel it's more likely that I don't have a private key for one versus the other.

yes but not based on the content of the traffic, (thanks to steganography)
also, the IP-blocking issue opens the door to other anti-censorship methods i could employ.  for example, using a VPN makes it so your ISP only ever gets traffic from one IP.
here's what's possible:
ISP's can throttle or not throttle traffic.  they can't tell what traffic is, but they can throttle or not throttle it.  they can tell what IP the traffic is coming from and throttle or not throttle based on that.  however, IP addresses can be changed.  i can buy a VPN subscription from a VPN with 100 different IP's.  now the ISP can block/throttle me if they see a single connection to an IP, but I can get around that by rotating the IP (which VPN i connect to) on a regular basis.  i can also just have "white noise" traffic, for example a script that downloads small amounts of traffic continuously, and a different script that connects to a regularly changing socks proxy, so my ISP doesn't get a regular IP that i always seem to only be connecting to.  the ISP would then see traffic from many different IPs all coming to me, and yet my socks proxy could still be used to get whatever traffic i want, completely unknown to my ISP.  now they could do analysis from the amount of data being transferred and make an educated guess that one or more IP's is a proxy service, but they'd just be guessing, and there's other techniques i can employ in addition to what ive already said, which can make that even more difficult.
the only realistic solution to combat something like that is for ISPs to throttle-by-default, and then not throttle some set of white-listed IPs.

historically, crypto isn't broken instantaniously.  usually, you just get academic papers showing that you can reduce the search space a little bit more, until after time, the aggregate of attacks means the lesser search space can be brute forced in a reasonable amount of time and the algorithm is considered broken.  it's rare that a algorithm that's been around more than a few years just gets found out to be completely broken.  that means we'll have a heads up, and time to switch, when the time comes, although you bring up a fair point, and it certainly wouldn't be bad to add a few extra OP codes for different signature types, just to have in the back pocket.  i think though that the most likely type wouldn't be RSA, but some type of post-quantum safe signature method, and i dont know enough to comment on what that would be.
as for different hashes, you can use sha256 right now if you want.  it would be a non-standard P2SH script, but you could absolutely encumber a transaction with a key that has a double-sha256 value instead of a ripemd(sha256()) value.  although i dont think it'd hurt to add in a few extra OP codes for a few extra hash types.
i kinda like that idea.  multiple signature formats, including a post quantum one, and multiple hash choices -- that would mean that bitcoin would be completely resilient against almost any future computing or cryptography advances.  i mean, individual users would have to scramble to move funds, but the software would already be up to date to handle such an emergency.  (well expect proof of work.  i think miners might not like allowing other hashing algorithms besides sha256 be allowed, since their mining equipment cost so much.)
the more i think about it, the more i like that idea.  but im not a dev, and im sure there's a ton of reasons why it's terrible and im an idiot.

A lot of traders believe that if a price has bounced back a few times at a certain level that there is a psychological barrier (in market participants) against going lower, and so once the price is near that level it is far more likely to go up than down.  They call it a "support" level.
It's just more trader voodoo bullshit.  When somebody tells you they can predict the market, ask them to make a number of specific and falsifiable predictions, and go test their accuracy.

I don't know if you're looking for technical explanations for various implementations, or if you just want to *understand* multisigs better.
If you want to understand them generally, I think I can help.
Whether or not you understand how Bitcoin works, you can generally grasp the idea that it's a ledger, and when you send money to somebody, you're really sending out to the network the statement "I'd like to edit the ledger to show I transfered money" and you digitally sign that statement so everybody knows it's really you.
But that statement isn't actually a statement, it's a script -- a miniture program that runs.  Every bitcoin transaction is actually a mini program.
Normal Bitcoin addresses are actually programs that execute and the code says "check this digital signature to make sure that it is valid for this transaction, then make sure the key associated with that signature is actually the correct key for this address, and if those two things are true, edit the ledger showing this money being unassigned from this key and assigned over to this key, which will require those same checks if it wants to spend the money.  And if any of those conditions I've outlined evaluate as being false, then don't edit the ledger."
So the mini program runs, and checks the signature and makes sure it's the right address, and makes sure the amounts are all valid and so forth, and then if everything checks out, your transaction will be mined.
Multisig addresses are actually just a different set of programming instructions in the script that runs.  They say "Make sure m number of signatures from the set of these n keys sign this transaction, and if all the signatures are valid and there's enough of them, and everything else checks out, then update the ledger."
That set of instructions is called a redeem **script**.  It's an actual script that runs.  And it's why multisig addresses are a small subset of what is called P2SH addresses.  a.k.a "pay to script hash" addresses.  Because whereas regular addresses are hashes of public keys, P2SH addresses are hashes of the redeem script.  (And so in addition to other conditions, they always also have the clause that you must hash the entire script and make sure the hash matches the address, so you know you're running the correct script associated with the correct address.)
This scripting feature -- the fact that the money movements are actually programs that run -- means there's a lot of extra neat things you can do (but which have yet to be fully utilized).  Those other programming things you can do are what all the excitement about so-called "Bitcoin 2.0" is about.  It's about realizing the potential for this neat new way of doing things via programming.  One of the lesser used features that is currently available is called "nLockTime".  Basically, in addition to any other instructions you put in a transaction, you can also optionally add the instruction "and only update the ledger if the date is later than X".
That feature in combination with multisig addresses can be used right now for safe and secure escrowed transactions where you can provably lock up money and show the other person that you can't spend it, but still withhold paying it to him until he fulfills his end of the bargain.  What you do is you make a multisig address using your key, his key, and an escrow agents key, and set it so two of those three keys are required to spend the money.
Then you send the money to that multisig address.  So now he knows that the money is no longer yours-- you can't spend it unless he or the escrow agent agree.
Then what you do is you create a transaction to spend the multisig money and pay his single address, but you also add a locktime requirement on the transaction before you sign it.  Then you sign the transaction (which isn't finished yet, because remember, two signatures are required for it), and send it to him.  Now he knows that he'll have the money after the time passes, because after that time, he can sign the transaction and it will be complete and it can then be mined.  But he can't get at the money BEFORE the time has elapsed.  So if in the mean time he screws you over, you and the escrow agent can conspire to make and sign a new transaction that double-spends his transaction, and without a time requirement, so this new one will get mined before his.  But if he deals honestly, he just has to wait out the timer and then he gets his money.
That's obviously a very complicated annoying process.  But the idea is that it's technologically possible to do, and to do without any central intermediary running things.  Web services can be built to make the process arbitrarily easy for the user, as long as it's *possible* in the first place.
Coinbase for example has a multisignature vault that they can prove means they can't access your money without your consent, but for which the user experience is merely "enter your vault password in order to spend your money".  Behind the scenes is complex, but the user experience is pretty easy.
Anyway, I hope you have a better idea of what multisigs are and how they and Bitcoin work.

Ok I can type for a minute.  Multisig addresses are special addresses that you can manually create in bitcoin.  Basically you take two or more public keys for various bitcoin addresses, and feed them into an algorithm and it will create a special address, one which can only send money if some percentage of the addresses used to create it agree.
Let's do an example.  The public key
    031491FD73F7CA778E74A544EAC3692F1ADBDC3CFA68F2C4187B142370D413CF2B
corresponds to the bitcoin address
    1FCJpX8sMd71ReXNcPqCZMw77ZCbjxTz8y
You have to have some technical knowledge in order to get that.  In fact, you have to have the private key for that address in order to get it, because the bitcoin address is actually a hash of the public key, which is derived from the private key.
(However, when you spend any money in bitcoin, the public key is revealed in the transaction, so you can find another person's public key that way as well.  [Here's]( a random recent transaction.  If you hit "show scripts and coin base" and scroll down and look at the second line under "input scripts" you'll see a bunch of stuff beginning with "040a61a8a60..." -- That's the public key for that address.  It is always revealed when you spend money, because it is the way to verify that you have the private key.  Oh, and public keys start with 03 or 04.  03 just means they're shorter.)
Anyway, let's continue.  Here's two more public keys:
    03A4169E43D1A1638165F1DE98B23ECCA596CD84507C686E542788BAF018B6B625
    03570A6F25B05BBA9DED0F60435D0A2B9FB1799868875AFDBB397281454431E77A
which correspond to the bitcoin addresses
    14RCaxJTcf4kaKGZp6dHUPDbGsZnHavSru
    1HvQXnKse1tU1oSFL3FaoiLUTX64GGWyYR
So now we have three keys.  Let's pretend one is a buyer, one is a seller, and one is an escrow agent.  we can now run a command in bitcoin to generate a multisig address using those.  Let's say we want two of the three of those addresses-- either the buyer and seller, the buyer and escrow, or the seller and escrow, to be required to spend the money from that address.  So we'd run the command in bitcoin:
    ./bitcoind createmultisig 2 '["031491FD73F7CA778E74A544EAC3692F1ADBDC3CFA68F2C4187B142370D413CF2B","03A4169E43D1A1638165F1DE98B23ECCA596CD84507C686E542788BAF018B6B625","03570A6F25B05BBA9DED0F60435D0A2B9FB1799868875AFDBB397281454431E77A"]'
and it will spit out this response:
    "address" : "37FhikitvwqyJM5K9RKjgf7dtw1C7STSVX"
    "redeemScript" : "5221031491fd73f7ca778e74a544eac3692f1adbdc3cfa68f2c4187b142370d413cf2b2103a4169e43d1a1638165f1de98b23ecca596cd84507c686e542788baf018b6b6252103570a6f25b05bba9ded0f60435d0a2b9fb1799868875afdbb397281454431e77a53ae"
That address, 37FhikitvwqyJM5K9RKjgf7dtw1C7STSVX, is a multisig address, which was deterministically generated -- so anybody else can re-create that same address and redeem script by themselves, as long as the number 2 is the same, and the order of the addresses is the same.  (The "2" means two of the three addresses are required to spend the money.)
So now anybody can deposit money into it that address, but in order to spend money from it, two of the three addresses used to create it must sign the transaction.  So for example, the buyer, after he receives his goods from the seller, can then create a transaction to send the money from the multisig address to the sellers own bitcoin address, then he e-mails that signed transaction to the seller, who must also sign it, and then once they both sign it, they can broadcast the transaction to the bitcoin network and it'll be valid.  But it's not valid unless two of the three addresses used to make it sign it.
You can make other multisig addresses as well, like 5 of 7, with seven addresses as input that requires 5 signatures.  Or 4-of-6, where you the buyer have 2 addresses, the seller has 2 address, and each of you choose one escrow agent which has one address.  That way, both the buyer and seller can unlock the money, or the buyer OR the seller, and **both** escrow agents can unlock the money.
In order to get the public key for an address, you either need some technical skill or to use third party tools like bitaddress.org or casascius' bitcoin address utility.

No, I'm trying to get you to admit that DCA is not the metric you should use for deciding how to invest.

They have the same of everything, except cost basis.  They are literally the same in every way, except with a different cost basis.
Given that, are you telling me that it's clearly correct to say one should invest in a different manner than the other, or than he himself otherwise would, because he has a different cost basis?

namecoin also has the id/ namespace specifically for this.  bitmessage has already implemented a way to interact with namecoin, so if you have namecoin running while you have bitmessage open, an option next to the recipient text box will be a button called "fetch address from namecoin" and you'll just type in the human-readable name, and hit the button, and it will grab the bitmessage address from namecoin.
you can look up a name, like khal for example, on [this website]( of via namecoin itself:
    $ ./namecoind name_show id/khal
and it'll spit out his info.  then if you type khal into bitmessage and hit the button, it'll magically turn into his address.  it works really well.  we don't need extra platforms.  namecoin already does everything, you just need to make your apps integrate with namecoin.  ethereum will eventually do the rest anyway.

When money is involved, you have to assume that somebody will be trying really hard, and even something that's "difficult" will get taken advantage of.  If it's not technologically *impossible*, it will be exploited, unless there's financial incentive against it.  So the two ways to prevent cheating are:  make it impossible via your code (cheating moves are invalid), or make it pay better to be honest than to cheat.  Some combination of those two will need to be underlying every single aspect.
Now some things, like collusion of 7 spots being the same person -- that's just not possible to prevent.  Somebody could have multiple computers/VM's, each with its own proxy, or multiple people could be in collusion, sharing their cards and strategies over the phone.  It's just not something that's possible to stop at the technological level.  So for something like that, the best bet is to design good heuristic cheating detection algorithms and have a robust user-rating system, so that things which are red flags for collusion get on a user's permanent record.  Stars for example is really good at detecting bots and collusion and chip dumping, purely through algorithms.  For example, I raised 3/4 of my stack on the river in an HU match once and then folded to a shove and the next hand I got captcha'd.  I had been a regular for years at that time and had not been captcha'd once.
So if the setup includes a rating system, and there are cheating detection plugins for the software which automatically send ratings in the background if they find something odd, that is to me "good enough" and also about the most you can do.  Additionally, you could make ratings cost some small amount in order to prevent ratings spam, or cost slightly more if you've lost X big blinds to that player in the last Y time, in order to mitigate "spite" ratings.
In a central setup like Stars, where they require identity information and bank account info, they can block a user and it's a pretty big pain for that guy to find a way to keep playing.  But in a decentralized setup where anybody can join and there's no identity, any user can create a new account on a whim.  That's why while a rating system might not be strictly necessary for a distributed poker system to work, it IS necessary for the poker community to trust it and use it.  The rating system is the catch-all for misc problems that centralization usually solves, like outing/blocking cheaters.  Combined with well-programmed algorithms developed by the community, the general security of a distributed system could easily be greater than something like Stars could ever hope to have.


The idea of a disconnect is that the person has *lost their internet connection* for some long period of time, up to even a few days.  They simply cannot access to internet to do anything.
That doesn't happen *often* but it DOES happen and it needs to be accounted for, so that the game for the other players isn't completely distrupted, and also so that the disconnected player isn't screwed out of any more than he needs to be.
And again, because this isn't a centralized system, we have to assume the maximum threat of cheating attempts.  So for example, a disconnect solution needs to protect the one lone honest player who disconnects while at a table of colluders and thieves.  Either via programming or via economic incentive.


Due to the short amount of time involved in acting in a poker hand, it's likely that they would need to be connecting to the other players at the table, it's just they would also be connected to other nodes they aren't playing with.  I imagine something where the table is passing around signed actions that make up a hand history, passing amongst themselves and then submitting completed hands to the table-instance sidechain, paid for by a portion of rake going to miner fees, (and they could also be mining), and then at some regular interval or when a player "quits" he sends out a request that those hands be "officially committed" by cashing out the money back into the main chain, and once that's done, it can't be undone and the table-instance chain and the hand history files can be purged/pruned from everybody's database (except yours, assuming you want to keep your own HH files).  And both table chain and main chain mining can be paid for via rake, which could still be significantly lower than any rake on any other site currently is, and since the player base are the ones mining, the rake doesn't leave the poker economy.


Thanks for the kind words!

I forget the exact meaning, but there's some trust exercise or bonding exercise or whatever that somehow involves the number 4, and so the 4 comes to represent love and friendship and community or whatever.  It's sort of like ending a letter with "xoxoxo" but in a non-romantic way.
Or rather, since it's a cult, it's a method of creating an in-group of choice center people who know what it means, and an out-group of "others" who don't know, enabling a psychological separation between members and non-members, and reinforcing feelings of love and community with other members and not getting that reinforcement from outsiders, creating emotional dependency on the choice center.

there's a handful of different things being used all together in bitcoin, so for bitcoin to break, all of them would have to be cracked all at once.  if just one of them is cracked, we can fix it pretty easily.  dont get me wrong, there's be a few days of widespread panic and chaos and a price crash, but bitcoin wouldn't *die* from it.
the good thing is that the history of breaking algorithms is universally one of simply reducing the search space more and more with varying attacks.  it's rare that an algorithm is just broken where you can just up and reverse it.  usually somebody finds a flaw that reduce the amount of effort required to brute force it.  and if that's the case, then we'll get a heads up long before it's ever a problem.  and we'll switch algorithms early enough that it won't be a problem.

That's why every multisig site gives you a backup of the keys they have.  That way, you always have 100% control of your money, and they have a key so that when you do trades on their site, they can still sign and complete the transactions in a near instant fashion, and everything works, but you aren't screwed in the event something like that happens.
That's the whole point of multisig.  It enables them to control the funds *when you allow them to* without sacrificing your ability to completely control your funds.
And let's not get off track.  You originally replied to me talking about multisig + mutually assured destruction, and turned it into something about Gox.  Do you understand that Gox is completely irrelevant to discussions about multisig, and that Gox's failure has no relationship whatsoever to multisig security?  Do you understand that bringing Gox up was complete irrelevant and retarded?

And in fact, if would be **a disaster** if cash were reversible, since no payment systems at all could possibly work, since the money itself might magically disappear if it were reversible.  Bitcoin is like giving somebody USD cash on the street.  If you give them the cash, it is no longer in your possession.  Now you can build bitcoin banks, and bitcoin credit cards, and bitcoin lending institutions.  And in fact, you can make bitcoin multisig addresses and create your own escrow with those.  With a multisig address, two or more parties are required to agree on how the address's money is spent before it can actually be spent.  It's a very novel feature, and in fact [I advertise my own address]( for anybody who wishes to use it.  (The neat thing is that I won't even ever know about it until somebody needs me.)  But I digress.  The main thing to take away is that bitcoin units of currency are CASH.  The bitcoin payment network moves that CASH from one address to another.  Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of giving people cash on the street.
As for the buyers, yes using the bitcoin payment network currently involves more risk than using services like paypal, because as I keep pointing out, bitcoin is CASH, and paypal is a *service*.  However, in the future more and more trusted entities will offer escrow services, and multisig addresses will be more commonly used.  With multisig addresses, because, like I said above, multiple parties have to agree how to spend the money, then as a buyer, I can create a multisig address that requires me, you, and an escrow agent, and two of the three of those people have to agree.  So I the buyer would send money to that multisig address, and you the seller would see that as proof of funds, since you know I cannot get that money back-- the bitcoins are trapped in that address until two of the three people agree to spend them.  So you then ship me the goods, and I then e-mail you the key to unlock those funds.  If things go smooth, the escrow agent doesn't even need to know that his address was even involved, but then if there is a problem, the buyer can contact the escrow agent, explain that they used his address, and ask him to settle the dispute.  So the escrow is actually free until you need the agent to decide something, rather than the current model for escrow payment systems like paypal, where they just take a cut off every transaction.

Most of the speculators I've seen don't have an in depth understanding of how bitcoin works and aren't confident enough to go further and speculate in alts-- Bitcoin is already at the threshold of their comfort.  So it's not laziness per se-- it's that they have no knowledge of, or interest in, understanding what bitcoin even is.  They just see dollar signs and that's all they *want* to see.

If you have no problem with SR, then Charlie helping sell bitcoins to a guy who sold them on SR is not somehow morally repugnant to you.  If that's the case, then he's done nothing wrong.  If he's done nothing wrong, you shouldn't be mad at him for harming the community or portraying bitcoin in a bad light or whatever.  If you personally invested in BitInstant, you may have cause to be upset at him because the manner in which he did his perfectly fine work may have harmed your investment.  But that's the only scenario where Charlie hate is remotely justified, and even then it's ONLY because he didn't run his business in a manner that best protected you the investor, even though he did nothing wrong.

No, but there's a difference between acceptable behavior and unacceptable behavior.  If a girl dresses slutty, she should expect looks and maybe a few cat calls.  You could argue that the men may be slightly in the wrong for that, but you could also argue the woman is also slightly in the wrong for dressing in a manner she knows *elicits* such responses.  It's a semi-trade-off.  But under no circumstances would she be anything but the victim if she were raped.  Dressing provocatively simply doesn't excuse that.
Do you understand that there's a difference in proportion of responses there?
You can ONLY make the argument you're making when you're talking about near proportional responses.  When the responses aren't proportional, your argument falls apart as there is clearly more blame on one side than the other.

it's decentralized just like bitcoin is decentralized.  when you mine, you actually are connecting to other nodes just like you do in bitcoin, and getting your mining "work" in a distributed manner, just as you get the blockchain in bitcoin in a distributed manner.  then, as you are mining, the coinbase-- the transaction that "mints" new coins -- the coinbase tx itself is set to go to a distributed set of addresses.  look at the "newly generated coins" transaction [in this block here]( and you'll see an example of a p2pool payout.
p2pool is completely distributed, just like bitcoin.  THAT's why it's better-- there's no worry about a central authority having you do bad work.  the work is a majority consensus, like bitcoin, so as long as over half the nodes are doing honest work, you will too.
obviously solo mining is the best in terms of safety, but p2pool is relatively safe and actually ensures you're likely to get SOME kind of payout in your lifetime at least.  that's all p2pool is-- variance reduction.  rather than one 25 btc block every X lifetimes, you get a little bit of btc more frequently.  not everybody who mines on p2pool gets paid-- p2pool in effect moves the bitcoin difficulty down and then just pays out smaller amounts based on that lesser difficulty, but hitting even a p2pool share is still some work, what the the bitcoin difficulty being so large and all.
so the p2pool "blockchain" includes the list of miners who have found shares, and the work, and then when anybody on p2pool happens to find a block, p2pool pays the most recent X number of share-finders.  so certainly there's some element of randomness to it, but it's still far less variance than solo mining.  and that was it's purpose, to make mining *possible* for the individuals, even if it's still not lucrative and easy.
and of course, it's primary purpose was to make mining distributed again.  the whole reason pools came into existence was because nobody liked mining for months and months and not finding a block-- they *felt* like they were wasting time and effort with nothing to show (even though they were contributing to the network).  so pools started so that instead of 2500 people all mining and one of them binks a block-- instead of that, they all mine and then agree that any time ANYBODY finds a block, they all equally get 0.01 btc.  So even though, on average over the long run, it's all the same, this method allowed people to see the fruits of their labor sooner, and get continual positive reinforcement.  p2pool is an attempt to have that same reinforcement but in a safer distributed way, rather than normal centralized pools where one guy controls everything and sends out the work and decides how the payout is disbursed.
the reason most miners dont use p2pool is because you get slightly less hashing power on p2pool.  because of the distributed network, there is a slight lag in terms of how fast you get new work, and how fast you can send and receive and process information.  so using a regular pool gets you slightly more hashing power.  (so would solo mining, but again, people like their continual reinforcement).
p2pool "nodes" are p2pool miners who are in effect becoming a mini pool operator within p2pool.  you connect to them directly, just like you would a normal pool, and then they submit your work to the p2pool and when they get a share, as opposed to a normal pool getting a block, they divide that share up and pay to you.  so if a share nets 0.01btc and they have 10 people mining on their node, they pay out 0.001btc to each of hte ten people.  but again, that's semi-centralizing again--- but it does have the advantage of getting a payout even more frequently.  but i mean, if you're going to mine on p2pool, go for the actual distributed p2pool.  the whole point of using it is helping protect bitcoin by being distributed.
it is my hope that everybody who isn't a giant for profit miner with $100k+ worth of mining equipment will decide to take the slight hit and mine on p2pool, so together they can comprise over half of the total bitcoin hashing power, and thus be the silent guardians of bitcoin!
hope this helped

Since you seem to have all the details, how about you explain then why Jordan never said any of this rather than leaving all of it out and confirming what OP said as the complete story?  If he had all that going for him, why exactly did he post none of it?  It couldn't have been too difficult to produce the rest of the e-mails or to explain the situation in full.  Why did Jordan just say "yep that's what happened, but I don't think he should blame me for it"....
Then again, I guess I'd try to make myself look good to a potential investor too, and make sure he thought I was the good guy.

Biggest systemic risk you say?  Really, because so far every exchange that's been open about who they are has gotten their ass robbed or robbed by the government.  Meanwhile, BTC-e has been sitting back working flawlessly.
BTC-e is the longest running exchange in bitcoin's history, and has had no massive thefts.  You want "just works"?  Well they have *history* as the proof of their intentions.  They've been operating successfully longer than anybody else.  I trust them more than I trust any other exchange.
That being said, I don't trust any exchange.  But I distrust BTC-e the least, by far.  Still, keeping your money with somebody else seems monumentally stupid.  The whole point of bitcoin is control over your money.

no you are completely correct.  i actually made [a proof of that exact type of thing]( using OP_RETURN to store the hash, and namecoin to store authorship and distribution information.
you embed the hash in the blockchain, you save a copy of the document that can provide said hash, and you have the private key for the input of the transaciton, so you can prove that you initiated the transaction that embedded the hash.  it's a complete chain of custody that proves you are the author, and in the event of multiple claims of authorship, you only recognize the earliest hash in the blockchain as the valid one, since it was the first.

that's not really the problem you think it is.  7 to 1 is perfectly fair if you get paid more than 7 to 1 on your money.  equity is all that matters.  the only real edge in that scenario is knowledge of the other cards, which certainly isn't nothing...
but it's also something that can't be prevented in a centralized scenario.
so the centralized solution -- heuristic cheating detection algorithms -- can also easily be applied on individual software that runs as part of a decentralized poker program.

yes, you can use key multiplication, multisigs, or split up a private key via secret sharing.
gavin has said one of the things he wants to do sooner rather than later is have multisig built into bitcoin-qt and phone wallets, specifically as 2FA, so that when you spend on one, you then get a notification on the other and you have to approve it and then it signs it as well.

Shares matter because they completely defeat the argument about the control of the money and the repayment schedule.  With shares there is no repayment schedule.  And if the poor man sells say 49% of shares for $100M he can still retain complete control.
Again, you ARE actually right about wealth being an advantage, but not for the reasons you state -- the reasons most people initially go to.  Those all, as I have attempted to make clear to you, boil down to the control of the money, which as I keep pointing out, can be the same for the rich and the poor man.
You can keep coming up with variations on these same reasons why you think the rich is better off, and I will keep explaining to you your errors, but I'd encourage you to think of what other ways the wealthy man has an advantage over the poor man.

Ya your analogy is about right.  The numbers involved may not seem intuitively to be that big when you write it out -- just 40 digits long -- however the reality is that a 40 digit number is so big that the likelihood of brute-forcing it or guessing it or what-have-you is so small that you don't have to worry about it.  And that's taking into account all the computing power on earth and all the computing power that will be created any time soon, and assuming Moore's Law.
So that twelve word seed is pretty safe.  Some of the super paranoid of people use a 24 word seed (not currently offered by electrum, although it may be when 2.0 comes out), and 24 words truly is overkill.  To put that in perspective, a 24 word seed has about the same number of combinations as there are atoms in the universe (aka an 80 digit number).  It doesn't matter how many trillions upon trillions (or more) guesses per second that the computing power can achieve, it's just not going to even make a dent.

Well it depends on how you define security.  It centralizes your point of vulnerability certainly, but that deficit comes with the benefit of now you can have excellent passwords *everywhere else*.  It's a trade-off to be sure, and having a central point of failure is of course not good, but that trade-off allows for greater security in every other area.

No I haven't.  I've stated that ISP's can throttle data based on IP addresses.  Then I outlined how to change an IP address.
Encryption and steganography make data-based throttling impossible, and proxies make IP-based throttling impossible.  Ergo, the only method by which ISP's can selectively throttle is with a IP white-list only fastlane, throttling all non-white-listed IPs.
Please point out where I stated "stated that encryption (with steganography) cannot be used to stop comcast from giving preferential treatment to netflix's data".

But make no mistake, this is a war.  Do you think he actually knows what the fuck bitcoin is or cares?  No of course not.  He is a pawn, a tool of war, bought and paid for.  Small portions within the banking industry and various government sectors are finally starting to understand the threat bitcoin could pose if it gains adoption.
The beauty of crypto is that it eliminates the need for violence.  You can be anonymous and speak freely with crypto, and violence can't be used to break math.  That's why I said the proper response is to laugh and taunt.  But if you slip up and they do find you, make no mistake they will take the food off your plate, and the last refuge of the incompetent may indeed be the only option available.
I know I may seem melodramatic here, but do not take this lightly.  This man has been either paid or otherwise coerced to make a bill about something he knows nothing about nor cares about, in order to prohibit you from engaging in voluntary trade with a unit other than the dollar.  Think about how insane that is.  Think about how innocuous the actual act of using bitcoin is.  The war has begun, the first pawn has moved forward-- and no matter how innocent and small he may seem, if you don't properly position your knight, you'll be check-mated in 5 moves.

yes they are.  they are also some of the fastest and cheapest ways to buy and sell bitcoin.  everybody knows that moving in and out of hte banking system is a pain and gives up your identity.  unless you use local bitcoins for small amounts, or are willing to go through a lot of effort or pay a high vig, you're going to have to go through the banking system to get into bitcoin.  most of us dont mind because we know once we're IN bitcoin, they can go fuck themselves.  and having options that allow you to QUICKLY move in and out is a valuable service.
remember, freedom is about *choice*.  no one is forcing anybody to use Coinbase or Circle.  but they are very good for what they are.  and they've never tried to hide what they are.  you know full well going in that they have to do KYC/AML, and you are free to not use then and instead use more private options if you want.  but that doesn't mean their services aren't useful.

Does merely owning Bitcoin inherently make one a speculator in your eyes?  Am I a speculator in computers because I find them useful?  Unlike computers, I own more Bitcoin than I need to transact with on a daily basis, but that's because Bitcoin *is* my savings account.  I think government fiat is terrible and inefficient and I want to use a better system.  I would be far happier if the price didn't move at all and I was just able to use Bitcoin for its properties and not have the headache of the price swings.  Does that make me a speculator?

yes.  nothing can prevent an ISP from throlling ALL traffic *except* certain IPs.  proxies can get around *black* lists by chaning an IP to a non-blacklisted IP, but if the ISP is only not throttling a small white of IPs, then unless you can find a way to get a proxy with an exit point of a whitelisted IP, there's nothing you can do.
if a white list becomes big enough however, somebody will find a way to set up a server inside the white-listed network and use it as a proxy.  but if the white list is small enough, it will be hard to circumvent. to use your example, yes if an ISP throttles all traffic except traffic coming from Netflix IP addresses, then unless you can get netflix to rent you a server, you're screwed.
for example if i get a package from my ISP that is 1mb down for all traffic except netflix, and 20mb for netflix, that would be near impossible to get around.  if an ISP throttles all traffic except a small white list, that's very difficult to bypass.
i'd also like to point out, to make sure we stay on track, that i originally replied to [this comment]( where you said "the fast lanes will simply require unencrypted data."  and my original reply to that still holds true.  the *content* of data cannot be used as a basis for throttling/non-throttling.  only the IP addresses can.  you claimed the content of the data itself could be used for throttling.  that is not correct.  steganography absolutely prevents that.  but no, IP address-based throttling is not prevented by steganography.  you've slowly changed the argument to "can ISP's throttle at all", which ive already admitted, yes they can.  a white-list IP-based throttling is very hard to get around.  all other methods however can quite easily be thwarted.

That's why in my scenario, I specify that the earliest time-stamp should be considered the valid one.  That solves that problem and the only possible conflict is when changes are enough to make one version substantially different from the other but still with much over-lapping material... but that's also pretty easily solved, and obvious and intuitive, by simply saying that the information which was present in the earlier document should be copyright of the owner of that earlier version, and the new information is owned by whatever the earliest incarnation of that new information is, even if that document contains other plagiarized old information.  I can't imagine any form of information of value which could not be separated between the two parties.  Can you?  Sure one might have an extra comma, but unless that comma is *really well placed*, it's not going to alter the total value of information in the document.  Even information that is built on other information can be segregated just the same way it always has been, as "original content expanding on the works of..."

And that's fine.  If a crime was committed, then a crime was committed.  Investors can shoulder *some* blame and the company could still have committed a crime.  There doesn't have to be blame only on one side.  Both sides could have done wrong.  The investors may have been stupid and the company may *also* have committed a crime.  If there were regulations in place that were expected to be followed and weren't, then that's on the company.
Edit:  Although, again, in the Satoshi Dice case in particular, there had never been much info about it, and people knew it was legally grey, and the sale was announced very publicly.  I'm still inclined to think the majority burden of responsibility lay with the investors on this one.

i did a [proof of concept]( of that a few months back if you're interested.
basically you OP_RETURN the hash of the work in a tx, which effectively makes a timestamp that is the latest date by which that the work must of existed.  then you sign a message with the input address to prove you are teh owner.  and whoever can provided the earliest OP_RETURN proof of that work with a valid signature is assumed to be the creator.  this way conflicting claims can easily be settled.  and if two people can sign a message with the same key, they both created the work with an equal share.
in my example, i also made a namecoin entry to store the document's information including the proof of ownership.

I actually agree with you.  I just like to spout "bitcoin is traceable" in hopes that regulators start to believe it.  Following addresses is basically useless.  Any one of those addresses could be for example, BTC-e, and we'd never know.  And like you said, you spread it out think enough, then move it around, and coinjoin it, and it's as good as untraceable.  Bitcoin is as anonymous as you want it to be.
That being said, it's worth pointing out that most people think bitcoin is more anonymous than it is, and don't realize how easy it is to link them with addresses when they take absolutely no effort to obscure themselves.

ya, more merchants and not many new consumers means more merchants who are cashing out their bitcoin into dollars, and thus fiat market cap gets lowered.  additionally, the price has always been inflated due to speculation, so it's been completely disconnected from any real growth or value.  both of those problems will even out over time, but it means in the early stages that the price is near random and is not even close to a meaningful metric of bitcoin's inherent value.

There is no corporation in charge of ethereum.  There's a corporation which pays people to write open source code.  Just as with bitcoins, the users decide how the protocol gets implemented.

It's not anonymous.  The anonyminity part comes from the fact that you can create an address out of thin air on a whim, so nobody knows for sure if you own an address or not.  Did you really give your bitcoins to that guy over there, or did you just send them to another address you own?  If you do that ten times, and all to yourself, you can very easily claim you don't ahve them anymore, and who can prove otherwise?
And if you do that type of thing enough, it becomes so obscure that the link from the first address of yours that somebody might know belongs to you, to the last address in that chain, -- that is so obscured that it's really hard link the two together.
So it's not anonymous per se, but it provides near infinite plausible deniability.

If you ran a business, would you keep the business's cash on the floor at the front entrance?
A web server is a door you keep open to a computer.  Putting money at that doorway is unwise.  The fact that you can run a bitcoin node on a web server doesn't make that somehow a smart place to keep your money.
News flash, bitcoin nodes serve other purposes besides holding bitcoins.  Bitcoin Core specifically allows you to run a node *without a wallet* for exactly this type of use.  Running a node and relaying transactions is a good thing and helps the network.
You are confused because you think every Bitcoin client should be a wallet because part of the use of Bitcoin is moving money.  But that's not its only function, and yes indeed there are clients that don't have a wallet and only do the other non-wallet functions.
Maybe learn how Bitcoin works next time before posting.
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:21:31
yes, exactly.  if a "tainted" coin is spread out wider, with a lesser "taint" percentage.
if you have a coin that 100% just came from an address that commited a crime, you might not accept it.  what if i didn't know that it came from a crime.  now one bitcoin unit is **not the same** as any other.  it is no longer fungible.
but if instead i coinjoin it with 99 other coins, now 100 people each have a coin which is only 1% linked to that crime, and 99% linked to people who believe in privacy/fungibility.  so now everybody in that coinjoin is likely able to spend their money.  each coin is the same as each other coin.
money **must be fungible** for it to work.  if you get a $20 bill, you don't care if it was previously used in a crime-- sure it sucks that crimes happen, but why should somebody else's bad deed stop your ability from spending your own money?  if people stop accepting bitcoins linked to "bad addresses" **the entire bitcoin network suffers**.  because now in addition to a crime, innocent people may get "bad money" that they didn't even know was bad.  money must be able to be spent for it to be money.  and that means that each unit of money must be equal in everybody's eyes to each and every other unit of money.  therefore, tumbling and coinjoining all coins must become a standard accepted practice in order to preserve the very nature of bitcoin as money.  if somebody stops accepting "tainted" coins, the money itself is fundamentally broken.  if you're friends with a guy who then commits a crime and steals money and then pays you that $20 he owed you, and you have no knowledge of his crime, that $20 needs to still be spendable by you.
bitcoin must under all circumstances be 100% fungible, otherwise it is useless.  the moment one coin is distinct from another coin in terms of value, bitcoin fails.  (im talking unbeknownst to the owner, obviously purposefully assigning extra value, like colored coins, is a fantastic idea.  but taking away value, without knowledge and consent of the owner of the coin is bad bad bad.)

electrum serves your purpose.  you aren't "relying" on the cloud.  the client can still verify what the cloud sends it as being valid or not.  it's an SPV node, it's still plenty safe.

And users of any software are made aware of terms of use via EULA's whenever they install any software.  That doesn't mean things go unnoticed.
This also fundamentally misses the entire point that I made in another reply.  Optional censorship is still censorship.  The UK porn block is still censorship even though it can be disabled.
Some percentage of users will fail to read about the updates or otherwise not know to turn off the default.  You didn't make this optional, you made turning it off optional.  If I have a virus that runs at startup -- the fact that I can just disable it doesn't make it *not* a virus.  And that's true with any malicious code.

which is one of many reasons why address re-use is discouraged and why things like bip32 are awesome.  an address is a hash of a public key, so unless you re-use it, the key won't be known until you spend it, and your tx will necessarily be the first tx known on the network.

They can't change the protocol at will.  All they can do is offer changes.  The miners and users still have to accept and use those changes.  Generally of course they do, but many do not.

that's a not unreasonable argument.
my point is that if you feel that way, then you should not pay taxes.  you shouldnt just pay them if you feel that way but you are afraid of being locked away.  if you genuinely feel that way, stop paying taxes.  but dont pay them because you feel extorted into paying them.  pay them, or dont pay, them because it's the right thing to do.  we have the current technological capabilities to be completely anonymous and to hide finances from the IRS.  dont pay them because it's blood money, pay them because you think you should pay them.  and if you dont think you should pay them, dont pay them.  do what is right by you, but do NOT give into coercion.

Your confusion is stemming from the idea that DCA is of any use to them.  My example was showing that they have exactly the same life circumstances now in the present, regardless of what happened to them in the past.  Given that, you need to explain how DCA is relevant to them in any fashion.  How does the DCA impact them?  (It doesn't.)
They have the exact same obligations and debts and on and on and on.  Their futures are identical.  If they each take the same action, they will have the same outcome.  Therefore, taking different actions will lead to different outcomes.  Therefore, the decision on which actions to take rests entirely on their present circumstances and how best to shape their future.  The past -- and the resulting DCA that comes form the past -- is not a variable in that equation.
In your equation, for example, C and D should not represent the cost basis itself, they should represent the actionable value of the knowledge of the cost basis -- it's predictive usefulness in deciding future action.  The cost basis itself only matters if it can be used to derive meaningful information.  So the question is, what meaningful information above and beyond the current circumstances can be derived from the cost basis?
And the answer is 0.  So you set them to zero, and the equations work out.  Your equations aren't working because you constructed the wrong equation to represent the problem you are attempting to solve.
I am at a loss how to explain it more clearly.  And I don't know if I'm simply explaining it poorly or if you are just unable to grasp to concept no matter how I explain it.  If it is my poor explanations, I truly apologize, because this is a very important concept for you, and anybody, to understand.  I have not been inconsistent, my logic is correct, and my words should be heeded if you want to become a better and more profitable investor.

Yes, but you can use a different crypto if that really bothers you.  There are plenty of other ones with decent hashing rate and a much more even distribution.  The reason most people don't care about that distribution in Bitcoin isn't just because they think Satoshi lost the keys or otherwise won' ever spend it, it's because he can only spend it once even if he did.  The Fed can print money at will, any amount for any reason.  And you are forced to use that money to pay your taxes, among other things.  Satoshi can only ever spend those coins *once*, and you are free to go to a market any time you want and trade your Bitcoins for other coins.  Nobody is forcing you to use Bitcoin for anything.  For example, one of my friends really believes in the philosophy behind Vertcoin and far prefers to use that.  And there's a service that lets you use Vertcoin any place that takes Bitcoin, and he prefers to use his money that way.  I disagree, but more power to him.  The technology behind Bitcoin is about enabling choice and freedom.
So while that big stash may seem at first glance to have Bitcoin be worse than dollars, once you understand the big picture it's really not.

The fact that you personally don't want to replay or mine or store certain tx's shouldn't stop me from being able to send them by default.  That's the point of Bitcoin, personal sovereignty.  A valid tx is a valid tx.  Turning this on by default is malicious and goes against the entire purpose of the system.

altcoin hate is misguided.  altcoins dont hurt or compete with bitcoin.  they provide a valuable testing bed for new ideas, and a smaller community and "get your feet wet" for newbies.  namecoin is a fantastic identity registration system and complements bitcoin very well, and thanks to merged mining, has a large chunk of the bitcoin mining power protecting it.  and dogecoin brought in loads of people into the bitcoin community because it was "fun" and "less serious" and just generally less daunting for people.  dogecoin and litecoin and other scrypt coins provide a backup for people who worry about what happens to bitcoin's value if sha256 gets compromised (whether or not you think that's likely or that bitcoin will be the biggest problem when that happens...), and they also provide quicker transaction confirmations for people who like seeing the quicker (albeit less secure) confirmation.  freicoin introduced inflation for people who liked the idea of bitcoin but not the austrian economics behind it.  proof of stake coins offer entirely different modes of validation for people who don't want to "waste" computing power with proof of work (i disagree that view, but hey, nobody is forcing me to use it.)
this all complements bitcoin.  this brings people into the system, and provide niches for every area of interest, and for every concern that bitcoin doesn't or can't address.  and progress in the most random areas can be integrated into bitcoin if it's useful and popular enough.  do you honestly think the fact that any Joe Codemonkey can create his own cryptocurrency is likely to be *bad* for bitcoin?  of course not.  the people who take a theoretical view of "infinite altcoins means bitcoin's usefulness approaches zero, therefore altcoins hurt bitcoin" -- the people who think like that have little experience with the real world and how value and marketing work.  they dont realize that bitcoin can permanently stay "in flux" and never actually head towards that finality of the theoretical limit of zero value.
altcoin hate is completely misguided.  altcoins only help bitcoin, and you guys who shit on alts are no wiser than all the non-bitcoiners who laugh at bitcoin.

it would still cause a giant hiccup though.  bitcoin would have to immediately hard fork and either ammend the protocol to include "verifying" as also checking to see that the hash of the tx was in a previous block, and/or change signature schemes completely... which would mean tx sizes go up 100x, and then bitcoin addresses could FOR SURE never be re-used.

because having a conspiracy mentality is a safer threat model to operate by.  whether or not it's true, it makes you more cautious.  therefore, you are continually protected while others keep getting screwed, which reinforces to one's mind that that view is actually *objectively* correct, even if it's not.
additionally, a lot of conspiracies you hear actually aren't quite as crazy as they may at first sound when you realize that all of the links in the chain don't necessarily have malicious intent, but lead to the bad outcomes regardless.  sometimes bureaucratic chains of command and simple self interest of individuals lead large organizations to act in seemingly malicious ways.  whole companies can go under because each person in the know was just trying to protect himself from getting fired and figured surely somebody else would take care of the problem.
so quite frequently, you'll get a bevvy of interesting things that aren't really coincidence, but they aren't really malicious conspiracy either--it's just how the cards happened to fall when all the players involved were doing what they do.  those kinds of perfect storms that arise not infrequently combined with the usefulness of a conspiratard mindset make conspiracy theories abound.

they'd be fine.  the client would just create a different type of tx when you import the private key into it and make a transaction with it.  the private key itself-- the thing that's on the paper wallet-- is not affected at all by this, and will always be valid.  dont worry about your paper wallet-- it's fine, safe as ever.

well ya, if comcast is sending me data and comcast isnt encrypting it, then im not getting encrypted data.... what's your point???  obviously the other party has to be sending you encrypted data in order for you to receive encrypted data.
if comcast starts filtering out encrypted data, you just make it look like it's not encrypted.


unless comcast is MITMing and converting-on-the-fly the stream, it's really really easy.  people have even embedded [multi-gig truecrypt volumes in movie files]( for example.  hiding data in pictures and creating grammatically correct sentences to represent different data are also techniques commonly used.

yeah, i mean, if by god you need something permanent, i am happy for you to use the blockchain.  that's its purpose-- if you need data for the entire world to always have access to, then by god it's there for you to use.  i just want to encourage people to not use it unless they have to, so as to not bloat it and make it more costly to run a node and thus make "legitimate" uses more difficult.  but yes, if you need to use it, then by all means, i support you using it.  just please understand the effects you cause on others when you use it and try to only use it when you need to use it -- it's a community resource and it would be tragic to have a tragedy of the commons where miners stop mining bitcoin, and move to another coin, because bitcoin is too resource intensive to use and takes up too much disk space, and bitcoin ends up on the way-side and ultimately fails, and then the data *isn't* permanently accessible any more.
i mean, *all* large data **can't** be on a blockchain.  after all, you cant keep a copy of all the world's data on every single computer.  it has to be distributed -- some computers have some data, some have other data.  that's the only way it can work.  but i think a good compromise of that is something like storj -- where the blockchain is just a reliable hash table of 100% of the files, and part of the network validation process is ensuring that there's a few redundant copies of all files, and so when nodes go offline, the other nodes with that file make sure another node gets a copy of it . so the network is continually re-organizing to ensure all the data always exists, but without a central server for all of it -- the blockchain is just a hash list of all the data that the network agrees must be online and available, but the individual nodes themselves do the work to make that happen.
that's a great setup, which ensures that all data is always available, without needing a blockchain that contains all the data.  it's a good compromise half way between one-server-has-the-data and the-blockchain-has-the-data

it's not better than a credit card for a consumer.  but that's not why it's amazing.  to understand its benefit, you have to understand what it is and how it works.  if you don't know any of that and you just look at it as a possible payment choice against your credit card, you will not be impressed.  if on the other hand you learn what bitcoin is and how it works and think about those implications, you will be very impressed.  they may seem the same on the outside, but a credit card and bitcoin is apples to oranges.  a credit card sends a request to pay a merchant through a 3rd party company, who charges both you and the merchant for the transacton.  and it uses money that the government prints and controls.  bitcoin on the other hand is a digital bearer token-- digital cash-- that goes directly between you and the merchant.  it's its own money and uses no intermediaries to work.  nobody can control it or prevent you from making a transaction.  it's a new better copy of the financial system, but not controlled by any central entity.
so you who have access to banks and credit cards, and don't mind giving out your info or using systems and money controlled by others -- well, you're not the target audience of bitcoin.

i dont even understand the question you are asking.  yes, downloading something via torrents only applies to people using torrents.
the blockchain is simply a big file, one which gets additions added to the end of it as time goes on.
if you want to, you can download the majority of the blocks via torrent and then stick them in the bitcoin appdata folder.  doing that, with the torrent, is faster than downloading the blockchain via the bitcoin client, so people who are using bitcoin for the first time, or otherwise needing to re-download the blockchain from scratch, can opt to do it that way.  you don't need to though.
you can just wait for the bitcoin client to do it itself.  both methods are fine and will work.  the client still verifies that everything is correct, no matter which method you choose.  if for example the torrent one is corrupt or invalid or something, the bitcoin client will see that, reject it, and then download via connected peers what it believes is the correct chain.

yes i know.  i wasn't sure *you* understood that when you made the statement: "DCA means you buy fewer shares when the market is high and more shares when it's low."
if you cannot predict the future, you cannot know if you have the high or low amount.  if you call it high or low presently based on where it was in the past, that's a mistake.  and if you aren't doing that, then you can't know what it is.  therefore, for any one to ever buy fewer shares when it's "high" and more when it's "low", they either need to predict the future or be making a logical error.
therefore, your statement cannot happen (expect for professional traders who indeed can tell the future more accurately than the market at large).


that's a patently false statement.  there's no two ways about it.  higher EV = higher EV, regardless of variance.  the only reason that advice is suited to most people is because large variance means they have a none negligible change of going broke, which is far less desirable to them than lower returns.
for example, if you wager everything you have on a bet that has a 50% chance of losing, and a 50% chance of quadrupling your money, then you'll go broke half the time.  but it's still a far better investment **on average** than a bet which guarantees a 20% return every time.  in fact, the 50% bet is *an order of magnitude* more profitable.  now, such a bet might not be suited to most peoples' risk tolerance, but it is still very clearly and objectively the better bet, and the only reason you'd bet less than everything you can is so you don't go bust *and you can keep betting on it*, because it's SUCH a good bet.
whether you won or lost the last time you made that bet is irrelevant to whether it's a good bet to make now.  your DCA of profits/losses on the bet is completely irrelevant.  all that matters when making the bet is your current bankroll and risk tolerance.  the past is utterly irrelevant.
similarly, what price you bought a commodity at is utterly irrelevant as to whether you should buy more, sell some, or do neither right now.  all that matters is your current situation.  the value and risk of the investment don't magically change depending on how you think about your past actions.


yes, that's a variable in the equation.  when i say "your beliefs about the future", i implicitly include all possible futures and their respective liklihoods, and take a weighted average across that spectrum.  if i am right say 70% of the time, i can account for that quantitatively.  (and indeed it would be prudent to add significant error margins for my estimation of my accuracy as well as any events which have exceedingly large consequences, no matter how improbable i think they may be.)


so you *can* predict the future then..?


that's completely true, and yet you keep talking as if you know when the high's and low's are occurring.


that's simply wrong.  there's no discussion to be had.  you're claiming the earth is flat.  it's not true no matter how badly you believe it.
if your profits or losses have changed your circumstances, then your circumstances may dictate a change in the amount you hold, but that change is still a function of your current circumstances, not your past performance.  if you are claiming otherwise, you are simply incorrect.


that is a logical error in reasoning.  it's simply not true.  many people believe it's true, but that does not make it so.
**think of two identical people, who are the same in every single way.  except one of them has $99,000 and one of them has $101,000.  they each invest in a separate investments which are also completely similar by all possible analysis, yet the first person makes $1000 and the second loses $1000.**
**now we are left with two identical people holding identical assets, with an identical amount of money, and identical life circumstances.**
**yet you claim it is more right for one to sell and the other to buy.**
do you see the error in that logic now?

It's actually an invalid tx.  An issue with multisig addresses when they first came on the scene was that some clients accepted multisig tx's with invalid sigs.  This tx had an invalid sig and was mined a few times by minority miners, but because the majority of clients rejected it, those blocks all got orphaned.  Blockchain.info doesn't list it as invalid, but it is, and it will never be confirmed.

If you haven't yet found a way to do what you want, I'd be willing to write a little Windows app to do it for 0.07 bitcoins.
You'd have to agree to the following though:
* Test the app first before doing anything important with it. I'm a new programmer, so I can't guarantee anything.  You don't hold me responsible for anything!
* Encryption and decryption will take like 5 minutes each, because for the life of my I can't get the scrypt C wrapper installed on my machine, so I'll be using a pure Python implementation, which is like 300x slower.
If you can live with those terms, I can pump out an app tonight.
Well even though OP didn't hire me, I still wrote an app to do what he wants.  [Here's]( a setup.exe file that will extract all the necessary files into a single folder.  Then just run the exe in that folder.  (Also, you can't change the name of any files, otherwise it won't work any more.)  [Here's]( the github page for it, which has the source code.
The input is the twelve words, all lowercase with a single space between them.  Password is your password.  Then when you hit encrypt, it gets a 4-byte salt.  The first two bytes are the most significant two bytes of the double-sha256 of the words input (and used as a checksum to see if the right password was entered on decryption), and the last two bytes of the salt are a random nonce.  Then that password and 4-byte salt are fed used to get a 64 byte scrypt hash with the parameters 16384,8,8 for scrypt.  Then the word list is turned into the hex seed, and the 16 byte hex seed is AES encrypted with the key of the least significant 32 bytes of the scrypt hash.  Then I stick the 4-byte salt in front of the resulting encrypted output, and that total 20 bytes is base58 check-encoded and is the output.
Again, the encrypt/decrypt process in the exe Windows app can take 10 minutes or more, because I had to use a SLOW pure Python scrypt implementation.  But let it work, it WILL work eventually, I promise.  I've tested it.
[Here's]( a screenshot.

in order to maintain a ledger, you have to know when things happened.  in normal systems, a third party -- the bank -- does that for you and just tells you who was first.  if you want to do that without a third party, you have to find a way to agree on the order of events.  alice gives money to bob, alice gives that same money to charlie.  if you say the first one is the real transaciton and the second one is fake, how do you tell which came first?  timestamps can easily be faked.
it turns out that in computing, there is not a good system for determining the order of events in a network without appealing to some authority who keeps track and whose word is law.
so how do you do it without an authority, and in a network where everybody else is trying to screw you over so they get the money (their tx is first)?  do you say "ok well the first one i receive is first"?  if you do that, then what if your connection is slow or interrupted, or the nodes you're connected to without transactions that dont benefit them?
until bitcoin there was no method of proving in a distributed method the order of things, in a manner that couldn't be cheated or forged, and without a central trusted authority, and in a network where you can't trust anybody else.
that wasn't possible to do until now.  that's the breakthrough bitcoin does.  not that it's a ledger.  but how it maintains the accuracy of that ledger.  it's the first and only known method of maintaining an accurate ledger, that we know for sure IS accurate, without relying on some authority.  prior to bitcoin, you always had to *trust* somebody else's ledger and hope they hadn't cheated, unless you maintained your own ledger and other people were requires to trust you.  bitcoin removes the trust.
this is very important, because now the entire function of banks and financial services is gone.  now we can do all the banking functions *without any banks*.  instead of your deposit being secured by the trustworthiness of the bank and the trustworthiness of the FDIC (or other insurance) in the event that the bank does screw you -- instead of trusting anybody at all, now your "deposit" is secured by.... nobody.  and everybody.
and this extends far beyond banking.  it replaces the need for central trust in every system that uses a ledger.  think about mapping domain names to IP addresses, and matching SSL certificates to those sites.  how do you trust that you are going to the right site and now a hacker's forgery?  well, your computer queries a trusted DNS server and asks them to tell it the IP address.  then it queries a central Certificate Authority and asks for the site's SSL fingerprint.  what happens if those places are compromised?  what happens if your computer connects instead to a hacker who tells you his IP address and SSL info, and then when you enter your passwords on the site, he now has them?  how can you know for sure that isn't happening?
the way that's done right now is via central authority.  your computer (or rather, your OS) comes pre-programmed with the public keys of various central authorities, so when you contact them, you can verify that it's really them.  but what if you didn't have that?  what if you didn't trust those certificates?  is it possible to verify the accuracy of information starting from scratch, and trusting nobody?
that's what bitcoin solves.  namecoin uses that same blockchain technology to map domains and other info to IP addresses (among other things), and you can verify that the information is accurate, without having to trust anybody.
this is a really big deal.  systems which previously were vulnerable to being shut down if their authorities got compromised are now no longer vulnerable, because there is no authority.  the accuracy of the ledger is completely and ultimately protected.  think about all the systems which rely on ledger and which currently require trust in the process:  finance, domain name, property ownership, authorship of intellectual property, voting, your identity credentials, and on and on.  now imagine if you could remove having to trust *anybody* in the security of those systems and instead being able to mathematically PROVE your entry on the ledger.
bitcoin isn't a revolution because it's faster and cheaper.  it's not.  it's a revolution because it completely removes the necessity to trust anybody in a given system while still having that system work.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:10:55
no, bitcoin doesn't get updates fast because all updates need to be careful checked and re-checked, because if they cause problems, people's livelihoods are ruined.  if you get a bug in skype that fucks up calls, they roll out an update and it's not a disaster.  if you get a bug in bitcoin that fucks up your transactions, you might lose your life savings.  bitcoin changes need to be thoroughly tested.
as far "all bugs aren't harmful until they are" -- well this bug truly isn't harmful.  all gox had to do to completely avoid this bug is look for double spends on their outputs in the tx's they created, and if they found one, have somebody manually check those tx's and double-spends before crediting somebody's account.  it should be such a rare occurrence that it shouldn't take much extra manpower, and even so, that's part of the cost of doing business-- making sure your security works.  this flaw is a flaw which allows you to duplicate a tx -- double spend it, but to the same outputs and with the same inputs, so the same tx exactly-- except with a different tx ID, so you have two tx's that are exactly the same competing to get into a block.  it's yet another zero-confirmation exploit, and it's *really easy* to look for.  you just see if there's another tx with the same inputs.
should this issue be fixed?  sure, yes, definitely.  but it's been known about for at least three years, and is very easy to watch out for.  the fact that gox wasn't is negligent coding on their part.

Ok I will break my vow not to respond in order to clarify some things.  First, the knowledge of the two people in my example doesn't have to be perfect, it merely has to be *the same* for them to decide on the same rational investment strategy.  Second, I mis-spoke when I said "make the same investments".  What I should have said was "decide on their investments in the same manner."  If two different strategies yield the same results and same variance, then yes they may choose "different investments" that are basically the same as far as they can tell.
My question is do you understand that they must *approach how they choose their investments* in the same manner?  (Which will, in my hypothetical in-the-box closed system, produce the same investment decision.)
For example, to use a poker analogy, that I should play my next hand as well as possible, and whether I won or lost the previous hand only matters in that it changes how much I have to bet with in this hand and what people's perception of me is -- but that the actual process of my decision making should not be altered by a previous win or loss.  The approach is still the same -- analyze my current situation and all the relevant variables and make the best decision I can.
Does that clarify it?

and indeed they are.  when one or another tx gets in the blockchain the other one is treated as invalid.  the software works just fine.  it's just while waiting for confirmations you might be confused, because *somebody else is double spending your money* (but to the same receiving address)... and your client rightly lets you know about that.  but as soon as one or the other tx is in a block, everything sorts itself back out because now the software knows which one is the "real" one.
additionally, the qt client doesn't let you spend unconfirmed transactions, which means your money is always locked up anyway while this is being sorted out.
in short, the qt software works just fine, just as it should.
and in other words, '"Transactions are always tracked properly by the Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind software" is still an accurate statement.

pow centralization of mining just isn't a problem.  everybody thinks it is but it's really not.  think about computers when they first came out.  it used to be big specialized hardware that took up floors in buildings and only a few people had access.  but technology improved, and computing trickled down into the masses.  now, there are certainly "super computers" and potentially quantum computers, but for the most part, computing is pretty distributed.  that process of distributing out over time has happened with pretty much all technology.  there's no reason to think mining will be different.

You are correct.  You understand what bitcoins are and what a paper wallet is.
The idea is that you generate an address on a computer with no internet connection, then write down the info on paper, then wipe the computer-- like a good wipe, over-writing each sector of data-- and so now the bitcoin address only exists on paper in the physical world, and no amount of viruses or malware or hacks can steal those bitcoins.  So it's safer than just storing it on your computer which may be hacked or otherwise vulnerable.

Back before the current stealth address format was finalized and there was only one key instead of a scan and a spend key, somebody did something particularly amazing and malicious:  They wrote an app to generate stealth addresses and payment keys -- something that wasn't available and that people wanted -- and they made it open source, but then the binaries they built for download if you didn't know how to use source code -- the binaries contained wallet stealing malware.  It was truly an ingenious plan, and hurt a lot of people.  [Here's]( the original thread.
So to answer your question OP: people do it all the time.  This is why everything must be open source and all binaries issued come with PGP signatures from trusted devs.

Alcoins provide a means for valuable innovation on the Bitcoin protocol without messing with the network.  Perhaps it would have turned out that 5 minute blocks were better for some reason.  Or perhaps peercoin is what will really take off.  Or maybe it turns out inflation is good and those coins do well.  You don't know until you try it out.
Oh I see, you don't care about innovation, you just care about the price of the coin you happen to hold.

Ooohh.  No, although it should be pretty easy to build -- the functions in main_functions do most of the work.  That being said, Vitalik Buterin has professional quality command line tools that should do what you're looking for.  [Take a look at his code](  But if you want to build something quick yourself, my bip39 mnemonic() function in main_functions takes hex or hexstring or a wordlist as input.  If it gets a word list, it outputs the hex, if it gets hex, it outputs the word list.  (And if it gets neither, it converts the input to hex and then outputs a wordlist based on that.  So a super long word list output means it didn't like the input.)  Careful though because BIP39 works on 4-byte intervals, so my function prepends 0's to match but doesn't give any warning about doing that.

Third party services will take some of the load.  Bitpay will eventually have a consumer Bitpay mobile app which is just a wallet, but it will do the entire transaction off-chain internally.
Stuff like that will take load off the network itself and also allow fee-less microtransactions.
Additionally, alt coins may serve for smaller amounts as well.  "Pick your cause! Want to support prime number research? Pay in Primecoin.  Want to support distributed DNS and records, pay in namecoin?" and "Would you like to add half a penny to your purchase to our local charity?"
Any number of things can evolve to handle the load... or bitcoin itself may eventually get some critical updates to help things along as well.  Bitcoin is slow to update because the updates can't fuck up.  If there's a problem with an update, people go broke.  It's end-of-the-world bad if there's a problem with an update.  So you should never ever EVER complain about the next version not being out yet.  And things like brand new additions on the protocol take LOTS of time and testing and re-testing, and re-re-re-re-re-testing, and then a hard fork months in the future.

brain wallets mean that the private key is *derived* from the brain wallet, so all an attacker has to guess is the brain wallet.
bip38 is sort of like writing a random private key down in a text file, and then encrypting that text file with the password.  the theif has to not just guess the password but *also steal the text file*.
so with bip38, attackers would also need the encrypted private key (that beings with 6P) before it becomes comparable.

That is exactly the approach I take.  The gist of it is that I attempt to numerically quantify the moral factor and compare it to equation of the probability of being caught multiplied by the consequences of being caught (again, quantified mathematically).  If that result is higher than the coefficient of my moral outrage, I obey the law.
In this case, I see no moral qualms with my objection to taking on the full burden of the victim when there is no net gain in the system for such a transference, I am simply victimized instead of somebody else.  I see no moral quandary in preventing that from happening to me.  If there were some *gain* in the system at large, like every $50 I gave back to the victim resulted in $100 worth of recouped money, either because the state matched it (lol I know I know) or because getting even half back is worth a lot to the original victim, then I might consider taking on some burden, since $50 worth of burden to me is worth $100 happiness to another.  But just a straight 1 for 1 transference where I take on the full burden of something I wasn't at all involved with is completely ridiculous and I feel no moral obligation to do so.
Individual circumstances will dictate whether I comply with such a law if and when I am faced with such a situation, but I confess, my coefficient of moral outrage on such a situation is pretty high.
I hope this makes clear I'm not trying to "get away with something".  It just doesn't make any moral sense to me that I should shoulder the victim's burden when it provides no extra benefit to the system and involves me in something I was not a part of.  The victim himself can just as easy shoulder that same burden with no increase of suffering in the system as a whole.  Having me take the burden is morally equivalent to picking a random person off the street and forcing them to shoulder it.  They had just as much knowledge and involvement as I did.
The proximate victim is the victim and the one who has the burden and the one who should sue.  There's no moral justification for bringing other unrelated parties into the incident.

The fucking ethereum coins matter just as much as namecoins matter.  Would it matter if namecoins were pre-mined?  No, because all you need is a very tiny amount in order to facilitate the main purpose of the protocol.  If you want namecoins, sell a small amount of bitcoin and buy namecoins.  If you want ethereum coins, write up a trustless self-executing contract to trade for bitcoins.

there's a fundamental mis-understanding you have.  money must not be able to be reversable, otherwise it can't be used as a medium of exchange, but you might not actually *have* the value you think you have if it can be reversed.  so money itself cannot be reversible.  reversibility is built *on top of* money, by other system, like banks and credit cards, which can all be built on top of bitcoin.  you are confusing the bitcoin payment system with the traditional payment system, without realizing that the bitcoin payment system is a core layer, a part of what makes it cash money, which cannot and **should not** be reversible.  but 3rd party banking institutions with reversibility can be built on top of it, just as they have been built on top of dollars.  but the idea that money itself should be reversible is completely erroneous.  money can't possibly work that way.  bitcoin is *cash*, it is NOT an insured payment layer like credit cards or banks.

That's impossible to answer because the two are so intertwined.  I'm so confident in Bitcoin that I've put as much of my money in it as I can, specifically *because* I believe in it and want it to succeed.  If my money wasn't in Bitcoin, I'd still want it to succeed just as much, but I'd be wondering why the hell I wasn't putting my money where my mouth [heart] is.
The value of bitcoin was just apparent to me once I understood how it worked.  Granted, that took a few weeks, but once I understood, I immediately loved it.  I was cautious, because I was unsure of myself but once I watched the market for a bit and did more research and gained more confidence in both bitcoin and in the fact that I wasn't just deluded or crazy, I finally just couldn't justify not having as much as I could in bitcoin.
If the price drops I'll be a little sad sure, but what I want more than price is people to use it.  Now I know obviously that would raise the price, but imagining for a moment that it wouldn't, I'd be thrilled to death if bitcoin sat at $10 and stayed there, but people were *using* it.  I'd be giddy as fuck if bitcoin was at $10 but Western Union went out of business because people were just using bitcoin instead.  I'd love it if the price was at $10 but every artist I liked had a bitcoin address on their website or in the [torrent data](
I want the bitcoin price to go up.  That would make my net worth as priced in USD go up-- but that's not *why* I want the price to go up.  I want the price to go up because I know that means that the market of users is increasing (and thus because the supply is fixed, the price must increase in order to accommodate the increase in value added to the system).  I want a $50000 bitcoin not because it'll make me well off.  I want a $50000 bitcoin because it'll mean everybody is using it.
The purpose of bitcoin is freedom.  A simple protocol that allows all of us to agree on the state of a ledger.  Simple enough, but what it allows for is revolution.  Because now we don't need to *trust* anybody to determine reputation, value, ownership, whatever else.  The **people** can now do that, by themselves, of their own accord, without coercion or prejudice.  It's true democracy as it has never before existed.
So yes, no matter what the price is or how much I have in it, I want it to succeed.  I'm actually *frustrated* and angry with myself that I am not yet very good at coding, because I have such a deep sense of urgency of wanting to contribute to bitcoin projects.  It's too important, and I want to know that the world knows about and has this technology available to them.  It's true democracy.  It's truly free speech.  It's true voluntarism.  *That's* why I want it to succeed.

1. with some effort, you could do it.  trading in person, or laundering en route to the exchange, etc.
2.  nobody knows.  we know how many *addresses* have coins, but since anybody can create any number of addresses out of thin air whenever they want, that's not too useful.
3.  the coins don't actually exist.  bitcoin is really just a ledger, and the coins are an entry on that ledger that says this address has coins, and then when you spend those coins, the ledger just gets updated with "this address, which you can clearly see has these coins, is sending them to this other address".  the solving the math problems is the process of updating the ledger in a particular way that helps secure it in the process of the update.  and it's more akin to drawing lottery tickets than solving an equation.  the more people drawing tickets there are, the more tickets there are to draw (the program adjusts the number of tickets based on how many people are drawing, so that on average a person finds a winning ticket every ten minutes).  and the more people there are drawing tickets, the more secure the ledger is, because the ONLY way to confirm the ledger updates is to win the lottery.

@_date: 2014-09-13 00:42:16
Breaking the hash function wouldn't allow bitcoins to be stolen.  It would merely freeze the network because blocks could be found instantly.  A bitcoin address is a ripemd160 hash of a sha256 hash of a public key, which is a point in a secp256k1 elliptic curve.
Breaking sha256 doesn't enable you to fake secp256k1 curve signatures.  So it's not useful in cracking addresses.  All it does is make finding blocks instant, which as said, would freeze the network and cause a hard fork.
And in the absolute worst case scenario where somehow that did cause bitcoins to get stolen, the fork would simply begin at a checkpoint in the past.  Other alts have done that already, and bitcoin did it in 2010 when a very huge fatal flaw was found that allowed anybody to spend anybody else's coins, and nobody had realized it until then.
Bitcoin in its current form is very likely to be secure.  It would take multiple compromises all at once for the integrity of system to be completely shot.  Rest easy.  It is worth hundreds of millions or possibly billions to the hacker that "breaks" bitcoin and can keep that flaw secret for a time.  Hackers have been focusing on it for years already, and bitcoin is still going strong.

Yeah, we kind of have developed a standard given 3 or 4 wallets have used the same method.  Use 12 Bip39 words into the Bip39 pbkdf2 function with no password, then use the resulting output as a bip32 seed to generate a root bip32 private key, and then use bip44 for the accounts and addresses, with the first address on a fresh new bitcoin account being m/44'/0'/0'/0/0.  Trezor, being the first wallet to come out, does exactly the same thing except they have the password "TREZOR" in the bip39 pbkdf2 function.  All other wallets don't use a password.
That seems like an excellent standard to follow IMO.  It allows a 12 word seed, which everybody seems to like, bip44 allows version byte identifiers so different coins can be used, and then there's 2\^31 hardened/non-hardened addresses per depth level, which ought to be plenty.  So you can have one master key for literally every coin that uses secp256k1 for its keys, and you could even have one chain be for multisig parts, and so on.  And with bip39, you can make a word list on any multiple of 4 bytes (32 bits), so people who want more than 128 bits can make longer word lists, and/or use a password in the pbkdf, and/or increase the pbkdf output.  Bip32 uses hmac-sha512, and I'm guessing that's good enough for everybody.
One of problems with Bip32 is that if you get a private key for a child key, and you have its parent's public key, you can work backwords and derive the parent public key, and then repeat the process and go all the way up the chain.  But hardened keys stop that in its tracks.  You can only derive up to a hardened parent but no beyond.  That's why the first few levels in m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 are hardened (as denoted by the apostrophe).  So if you get the key for the last zero, and you know the public key for middle 0', you can derive the private keys for everything below that 0'... but you can't go up any more beyond that.
The reason ALL keys aren't just hardened by default is that you can't generate hardened children from parent public keys, and so you need non-hardened keys if you want to manage multiple accounts used by different people, like say a company would.  But the child-private-key-deriving-parent-key problem is why you'll always see the chain of accounts almost always being hardened keys right up until the point where you're generating the keys that are actually being used.  That way if the private key for that collection gets compromised, you can just increment a notch above the hardened key and stop using that old chain. 
Gah, I'm rambling.  The point is, the basic gist of this standard seems really solid all around as far as I'm concerned.  One 12 word mnemonic for everything, and it's perfectly secure.  And you can use it for almost anything, all with just the one root key.

yes, k is supposed to be a random nonce.  "nonce" standing for "number used *once*".  if that value is used twice (or more), the private key is completely compromised.  so the issue with that k value isn't necessarily about non-randomness, it's that the value has been re-used.  some software mistakenly did not generate a new value, or had a poor RNG that made it occasionally re-use a same value.  that android vulnerability a few years ago came about because the Android RNG was poor and re-used values very occasionally.
it's also really easy to see when this value is re-used, because another value derived from it is a part of the transaction signature, so if you see a tx from the same address and that part of the signature is the same, you know you can get that private key.
so what this RFC protocol is, is basically taking the hash of the transaction and your private key, and hashing them together, and using that hash as the nonce.  this guarantees that the number is not re-used, since a different transaction (or different key) will produce a different value, since the final value is a hash of the key and the tx.  and assuming the hash function is "random" enough, that new value is truly random and has a 1 in 2^256 of making the same k value -- which is the lowest probability it is possible to achieve -- i.e. that's as good a system as any possible.
(somebody more knowledgeable than i am about all this, please do correct me if im wrong.)

yeah, basically.  the protocol is dead simple.  you hash groups of digitally signed transactions until you happen to get a hash within a certain value.  i dont see where there's room for problems.  the few major problems in implementation have already been fixed, and things like last march proved that upcoming problems will get solved pretty quickly.  and no problems other than ECC being broke can cause me to just up and lose my coins.
i understand that this sounds completely insane risky to most people.
but ive thought very long and hard about it.  and i decided that bitcoin is a safer place to keep my money than usd cash on hand or in a bank.  it's also easier to use than the banking system.  and finally, the price rise makes it happen to also be a really good investment.
as insane as the conclusion sounds, those three deductions lead directly to that very conclusion: all my money should be in bitcoin.

ok fair enough, that's true.
my main concern is that people don't understand that brainwallets need to be more secure than other passwords.  they just think a password is a password, but normal passwords are also protected by the fact that a theif isn't looking for your data and can't access it to even try his guesses to begin with, so in order for your say password manager to be compromised, somebody both needs the file itself first and then they need to guess the password.  but for brainwallets, everybody everywhere has access to the data and can try an infinite number of times without being locked out for trying too many guesses.  the security of a brainwallet password needs to be much higher than a normal password.
that's my main concern-- that people don't understand that difference.
the other problem though for your solution is long term storage.  let's say i do remember it, and put my savings in it, and then come back in three years and have forgotten it.  i think that risk is fairly high.  and like i originally said, it's not secure if it's easy enough to remember that there is no chance of you forgetting it.  so actually, even though you are technically right, i think im gonna stand by my original statement.

You can tell Bitcoin Core in the config file to go to an IRC channel dedicated to listing peers.  Or you can go to a block explorer site like blockchain.info and connect to one of their listed peers.  It's not *that* hard to find a couple peers to bootstrap onto the network, and then once you've done that, your client keeps a local copy of IPs of peers.

The problems you have are not problems.  They are already solved.
A colored coin has the base value of its value as a bitcoin, since you could just destroy the color and still use it as a bitcoin.  Trading the shares reflects that.
So if you buy $1000 worth of reddit shares and pay 2.6 bitcoins for it at a  bitcoin price of $400, and get a 0.1 colored bitcoin, that colored coin now is worth $1040 -- because it's 1/10 of a bitcoin and then it also represents $1000 worth of shares.  And you paid $1040 worth of bitcoin for it.
If the price of bitcoin goes from $400 to $500 and the value of your shares goes from $1000 to $800, your colored token is now worth $850 -- $800 for the shares, and $50 for 1/10 of $500, and you could trade it on an exchange for 1.7 bitcoins  (since bitcoins are at $500, and 850/500 = 1.7).
It's very simple math to figure out the value of a colored coin, since you know what fraction of a bitcoin it is, what the price of a bitcoin is, and what the price of a reddit share is.  This is basic math.
Reddit colored coins can be traded very easily just like any bitcoin or alt coin, and the price of the trade simply reflects the combination of the price as a bitcoin and the value as a share.
As for the 2 satoshi ordering problem, that's very simple to solve as well.  All colored coin implementations have an order that they specify in their protocols, which dictates how you follow the "real" colored coin through mixed transactions like that.  The protocol would specify that one of those satoshis is the colored one.  All reddit needs to do is before any colored coins are handed out, they just publish the protocol by which the coins are followed.  There are a few different protocols to choose from, which would all work fine.

Imagine if YOU weren't good with computers and didn't know how encryption worked and didn't understand how hackers got at stuff and thought the name of your puppy was a perfectly good password.  You'd be skeptical of Bitcoin too-- you'd worry about it being hacked, you'd worry about it being counterfeited even though these nerds say it can't - FFS it's digital *of course* it can be copied!  If you didn't understand all that stuff, of course Bitcoin wouldn't seem revolutionary to you.  Not only is it not as fast as Paypal, but it's not even insured and you have to exchange real money for it to even use it.  Why would anybody go through the hassle!

There's many other, because the first char after "BTC" isn't always representing a part of the checksum (sometimes it is, but sometimes not, since hex is base16 so sometimes a hex char will fall into that slot and sometimes not), so I can add different characters and get a new checksum, and have many different addresses.  You'd want to fill up the space before the checksum entirely to prove your point.  That's why the counteryparty burn address is 
    1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr
Base58 is just a math conversion to another format.  Just as 10 in base2 is 2 in base10.
In practice, this just means that as long as your base58 string is the right number of characters, 33 or 34, you can "decode" the base58 string into hex, and if the non-checksum part is correct, you can easily re-compute the correct checksum.
That's what my tool does.  It assumes the non-checksum part is right and fixes the checksum, by decoding the base58 into 25 hex bytes and ignoring the checksum, and then re-encoding the hex with the right checksum.  Eventually I'm going to add to it the ability to iterate through changing one or two characters and seeing if that fixes the entire address, including with the same input checksum, before doing the check-sum fix, since it's more likely that an address was simply mis-typed if there's an error.  That way, the utility will "fix" a mis-typed address, rather than being just an app to recompute a checksum.

all of those are completely useless against waiting for confirmations.  so if you can't publish a relatively long (like greater than 11 or 12 blocks) side-mined chain, then none of those attacks work against somebody who simply waits for a dozen confirmations.  the only threats a 51% attacker can do is refuse to include tx in blocks, (or prioritize certain tx), or double spend.  but if he can't side-mine, then he can't double spend beyond a short amount of time.  so if that's true, then it means that the only thing an attacker can do with majority hashing power is stop tx from getting in blocks, which means people who send those tx simply have to wait longer for them to get in blocks mined my the minority.
heck, even if a 51% attacker forks the protocol and lets himself publish longer side-mined chains, the rest of us won't consider it valid and all he'll done is have created a new coin from the fork and he'll be mining his own new coin while the rest of us are using the real bitcoin.
this is fantastic.  even a 51% attacker adversary can do almost nothing to disrupt bitcoin.  all people need to do when somebody has 51% or more is simply wait for more confirmations before considering a tx valid.

again, i must point out that not being perfect doesn't make it not the best choice.  it is possible for it to have flaws but other choices to have more flaws, making it still the better option.
you said Tails is "riddled with security holes" which implies that there is some *better* alternative that OP should be using.
im outing that as a scare tactic that has no basis.
if you google vulnerabilities for *all* OS's, you will find all of them have vulnerabilities.  if you then research the time it took to fix them, you will find that Tails is among the quickest to fix known vulnerabilities.  it also has historically had fewer vulnerabilities than others.  and as mentioned earlier, its native setup prevents most problems from even being a problem to begin with.
it is clearly the superior option (for normal people, not linux users who use whonix)
so once again, i am claiming you are full of shit.  tails has less vuilnerabilities than other OS's and also fixes them quicker.  it is also more secure out of the box.  if you are going to claim that it's "riddled with security holes" you need to provide examples.  and specifically, since your claim implies that it is a poor choice to use given those holes, you need to show how it's *less* secure than other options.
either you're full of shit and trolling, or you don't understand the concept that something which isn't perfect can still be the best option available.  so which are you?  stupid, or lying?

sort of... i think you're thinking of brainwallets.
the reason brainwallets are insecure doing that is because *every guess is saved* and you can sweep money from any address you've ever checked instantly.  so you have to protect brain wallets from being guess *ever at any point in time*, with multiple attackers continuously guessing.  but with BIP38, you're only protecting against one address, so the attacker would need to expend his resources to get only one address.  plus bip38 uses a more cpu-intensive algorithm than brainwallets.  so the password for a bip38 protected key, especially if even the encrypted key isn't known, can be much much weaker than a brainwallet passphrase would need to be.
obviosuly, in every situation, the stronger the password the better, but the threat model for a bip38 key is far less severe than the threat model one needs to have for a brain wallet password.

as for you picking up the fiat, the best way to do that is a combination of mutually assured destruction of bitcoins via multisig, as well as hiring people to go pick up the geo-cache for you.  or maybe you can do what the japanese do with the pachinko balls, and just create some stupid intermediary currency to get around the law.

Bingo.  I keep saying it.  It's not science unless you make falsifiable predictions and your theory allows others to test it and make similar falsifiable predictions as well.  Economics in its current form is nothing more than wild-ass guessing.  For all the fancy language and standardized tools, I've yet to see almost any falsifiable predictions.  And the few I've seen have done no better than randomness, with after-the-fact 20/20 hindsight excuses as to why it didn't work.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  Economists are full of shit.

Yes, you can use an OP_RETURN or other provably prunable output which means they can never be used as an input for another tx, which means they're gone for good.
You could also just use those long vanity addresses which are exceedingly unlikely to have a known private key, like the [counterparty address]( or the [bitcoin eater address]( or other similar [custom addresses]( which are unlikely to have a known private key.  This however isn't \*impossible\* to spend (because there might be a private key), it's just damned near impossible (because it's unlikely that anybody knows the private key).  Whereas an OP_RETURN is actually truly impossible to spend and 100% loses coins for good.

patterns only exist in the past.  all that matters for the future is the predictive value of theories.  i have yet to see traders and economists make any predictions any more use than chance would dictate.
if everybody is so good, make meaningful predictions.  i for example claim that the btc-e usd price of bitcoin will be at or above $1300, at least once, on or before May 15th of this year.  (that is to say, it will hit that price at least once, not necessarily that it will stay there or that it will be at that price on the 15th.)
that's a prediction which can easily be falsified and used in conjunction with other data to determine how well my economic models hold up.

Proving it via the blockchain costs almost nothing.  I could create a tx with a small miner fee and an OP return output and be done with it.  Officially copyrighting things the legal method costs at least the filing fee and some other stuff presumably.
As far as legality and practicality go-- yes I'm talking theoretical.  With the blockchain method I can prove *to anybody who understands crypto* that I own something in an infinitely more convincing manner than an official legal registered copyright would do.  Whether the legal system is smart enough to keep up doesn't matter to me.  I don't care what the slow old world does.  If I ever create a work, I will do a blockchain copyright, and sell it myself or on bitcoin download sites, I will "leak" it myself shortly thereafter if nobody else has, and I will have a donation address in it.  I will not care about copyright issues, and if somebody wants to donate or buy it "legitimately", I will only be able to prove that I am the creator, but they will ultimately choose how much they care, of if they don't understand crypto, how much they believe me when I say I created it.
In the digital world, content simply cannot be contained.  Information *must be free* on the internet, that is its *sole purpose*.  Thus creating content *cannot* be done solely for monetization, and any artist or creator who does so is only ever going to be frustrated by piracy.  Copyright is *proof that you created it*, not a license to selectively withhold that information once you've created it.  Once information is out, it's out.

Yes, betting on a lower risk thing will give you lower risk.  *That's true regardless of your previous bets.*  The arbitrary metric of whether a previous bet, or the aggregate of your previous bets, was higher or lower risk doesn't change the risk of the current bet.  The past doesn't matter.  The DCA doesn't matter.  It only matters because it got you to your current situation.  But given the axiom of being in your current situation, you should make the same decision with the same process.
An example I gave the other guy earlier was:  imagine two people.  They are identical in every single way.  They have the same life circumstances, same obligations, same hope and dreams, etc etc.  They also both have exactly $100,000.  The sole different between them is that previously one of them had $99,000 and made $1000, and the other previously had $101,000 and lost $1000.  But now here they are in the current situation, each with the exact same life and same amount of money and their (same) choices will have the same outcomes.
Do you see with that example how it would be an error to claim that one or the other should invest differently based on their past, even though they have entirely different DCAs?

I only gave my credentials because you asked if I had made any profit.  And while appeal to authority is indeed a logical fallacy, it is still correct to defer to experts when one isn't knowledgeable enough about a topic to come to any reasonable conclusions, since experts are more likely to come to correct conclusions about the given topic.  That being said, you are absolutely correct, authority is not a logical argument.


I have.  It's the transitive property of mathematics.  If one equation is the same is the other, the the result will be the same as well.  I gave you two people with two identical situations, and you claimed they should do different things.
What more is there to say?  How better can I explain it to you?  A=B and B=C; therefore, A=C.  Saying A != C is mathematically unsound.


Logic needs no evidence for its support, for it is purely a mathematical derivation from the most basic axioms (although counter-evidence to the argument may imply a previously uncaught error in logic).


Again, the argument is simple.  First: The past results of independent trials have no bearing on future independent trials.  Second: Your present circumstances and the future are the only things that can be changed by any decision you make.  Third:  Therefore, aside from its effects on creating your current circumstances, it is not possible for the past decisions to influence the future -- the past can only create the present.  Only your present circumstances in conjunction with your present decisions can influence the future.  The past cannot skip over the present in order to influence the future.  Fourth:  Therefore, your decisions about the future should not include the past as a relevant variable.  Only the future and the present are relevant variables.


It is not my word you must take.  It is my *words*.  And they are indeed correct.  Your failure to grasp them does not negate that fact, although given your higher education it is somewhat frustrating.

yeah by 2 factor i mean 2 separate factors.  two separate computers.  not e-mail auth.  but like multisig where a desktop has a share and a phone client has a share, or something else where two separate devices need to do some kind of communicating.  i think having like an electrum client that has a seed that generates multisig addresses would be good, then you have 2-of-3 addresses in your client, and it gives you a PDF to print out (then delete) of one share, and your phone has a client which can sign for one share, and the desktop client has one share of the addresses, and then the trusted electrum server sends the unsigned tx's around to the various clients.  that'd be a good reasonable secure way for non-tech savvy people to use bitcoin in a pretty secure way.  they write down their pneumonic or give it to a family member, so they have that as the ultimate backup, and then for their normal usage, they also have a paper copy of one share in case they lose their phone, and then they either have to manually type in the paper private key, or get another sig from their phone, before the tx will send. and it FORCES them to only use addresses (and address shares) only once.  that'd be a pretty secure method for grandma to be secure without being TOO much of an extra hassle.  obviously the comp would need to be secure on the setup when it displays the pneumonic and gives you the PDF of address shares to print.  but after that, it's safe even if it gets infected, because either you need to manually type in the key from the paper, or you need to get a tx signed from another device.

the actual private key is the hexidecimal format they list.
hex is base 16.  it goes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f.  so for example 11 in normal number format (base 10) is "b" in hex.  (although hex is almost always in two-digit increments, so it would actually be "0b".  the reason hex is in two digits, is because it's actually base 256 aka 16*16).
so just like you can convert base 10 to hex, or either one of those into a string of 1's and 0's (aka base 2), you can also convert them into higher bases, like base64, which uses numbers, lower case letters, uppercase letters, and a few symbols to all represent larger numbers with a single character.  base58 is roughly the same as base64 except it doesn't use any symbols, or lowercase L's and capital I's, or O's or 0's, specifically to prevent typos and misunderstandings when reading it.
the Private key WIF format uses base58.  all it's doing is converting the hex from base 16 into base58.  it always starts with a "5" because bitcoin prepends a "80" at the beginning of the hex to identify it as a bitcoin private key.
(base58 encoding in bitcoin also usually hashes the hex and appends a small portion of the hash before converting, so that any typos will fail the re-check of the hash, and thus typos will be caught and you can't enter it wrong without throwing an error.)
bitcoin public addresses are actually the hash of a public key, not the public key itself.  bitcoin public keys are actually just math coordinates, an X and Y value, on the math curve Y^2 = X^3 + 7.  because that's the curve, you can easily see that for any given X value, there are two possible Y values, a positive one and a negative one, both of which equal Y^2 when squared.  (bear with me, i'll explain why this is relevant soon!)
therefore, when you type out a public key, you can type the full key -- the X and the Y coordinate -- or just the X coordinate, and from that you can derive the Y value.  so uncompressed bitcoin keys are the full X+Y coordinates, and compressed keys are just the X value, but with a single byte prefix to indicate whether Y is positive or negative.
the compressed key and the uncompressed key will have different hashes, and since bitcoin addresses are hashes of public keys, that means that a public key can correspond to either of two addresses, depending on whether the public key is written in compressed form or uncomrpessed form.
now then, back to private keys.  the base58 WIF keys that start with 5 are always assumed to belong to uncompressed public keys.  therefore, you can easily map a "5" key to a single bitcoin address.  if you want to denote a compressed public key, and therefore a different address, you add a "01" in hex at the end of the hex format of the key before converting it, which makes the private key when represented in base58 form always start with a "K" or "L".
most bitcoin software will only ever read the base58 addresses, but it is possible to convert to/from base58 from other formats.  that website that is showing you all those different formats is just showing them to make things easier for you, so you don't have to go through the modicum of effort to convert it yourself.
so you can write down *any* of those keys, and it's fairly trivial (once you understand what's going on and how to do it) to convert it between formats.

the redeem script is sort of like the "public key" for a multisig address.  it's what gets hashed when you create the address.  (so even similar messages have hashes that are entirely different.)  and it's what you need to show in order to spend the money.  miners verify it by hashing it to make sure it results in the hash of the address you're trying to spend, and then they verify that you've met the requirements outlined by that script.  a 4-of-4 redeem script is basically a script that says "4 of the following 4 keys are necessary to spend this money".  so a 4-of-4 address and a 4-of-7 address would be totally different addresses, with different redeem scripts, even though the same 4 private keys could spend from either address.  the 4-of-7 address requirements were different, so it's a different address.  it just so happens that the same four private keys could also satisfy its requirements, but so could one of those four along with three other keys that couldn't be used in the 4-of-4 address.  different requirements, different redeem scripts.

Me too.  So many people don't seem to understand that.  Even if the worst case scenario happens and he dumps his coins and causes chaos, it can only happen the one time.
So if you're worried about pre-mining, the Fed should absolutely terrify you.  They can print however much they want at will without your knowledge or consent.
With Bitcoin, you know how much Satoshi has, and if it really does bother you, there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies with less "pre-mining".  (I put quotes around "pre-mine" because it's not like he actually did pre-mine -- he told everybody in advance about it, just nobody bothered to sign up, so he happened to get a lot of the early coins.)

Unfortuantely it's not possible to prove a negative.  Let's say they were stolen and the criminal transfered them to address X, Y and Z.  That's the same on the blockchain as if Mark himself stole them and sent them to address X, Y and Z.  But you are right OP that evidence of them being sent out is at least evidence they were moved, since it looks, from some sleuthing, like they actually still have most of them, which means that either Karpeles stole them himself or he just outright forgot/lost the private key.  I think the latter is most probable.

No the fork happened specifically because half of the people had NOT upgraded, and the two versions had differences of opinion on what a valid block was.  so people on the old version were mining one chain, and people on the newest update were mining another chain.  it happened specifically because people *hadn't* updated.  and that's a good thing, it means that there are plenty of cautious people like me who wait to upgrade, so if problems in the new client occur, they can be fixed.


No, a small group of programmers posted things online that they *asked* the community to do, and they e-mailed  a bunch of people running popular mining pools, who then contacted their users, and collectively the bitcoin users were thereby notified of what happened and why and were shown the changes that these small group of developers WANTED them to do, and the users read over the proposal and decided that it was a good thing to do and they VOLUNTARILY decided to implement the change, after being fully informed of the situation and what the proposed fixed was.


of course it can happen again.  that's exactly why i wait to upgrade.

Invalid transactions are dropped and not relayed.  They are *already* treated as spam.  They don't "damage the blockchain" in any way.
And Luke didn't just block "real spam", he blocked what his opinion of spam was, for certain users without their knowledge or consent.  They were suddenly being censored without having given their explicit permission.
Lastly, it would be laughable if it wasn't so depressingly distrubing that you are defending this method of keeping the blockchain secure.  If you as a node operator don't wish to mine or relay such transactions, that's fine, but it is NOT an acceptable security measure to have others do that without their express permission.  The "agenda of these extremely vocal advocates of filling the blockchain with gigabytes of worthless data" is that it's not your right to decide what gets put in the blockchain.  The agreed upon protocol already does that.  Valid transactions get put in the blockchain.  A valid tx is a valid tx, and you don't get to decide what constitutes valid.  Everybody collectively decides.  Satoshi Dice has *just as much right* to the blockchain as you do.  If you don't want to participate in a network that mines them, rally so 50%+1 of the network agrees to adopt your spam standards and doesn't accept blocks with their tx in it, or use a different coin.

Exactly!  And whether they stand to make money on their next trade has nothing to do with their previous trade.


No, it re-asses the risk at the current time.  Which is the correct approach.


That's actually not true, you just can't see it.  I did in fact lay out the logical step by step process of how my conclusion was derived, but you failed to see/understand it.  And I don't really know what to do from this point if I can't use logical axioms in a step-by-step process for my explanation -- I genuinely don't know how to break it down more basically.  I feel like I'm saying "ok we'll start here: 1 plus 1 equals 2."  And you say "no it doesn't!"  And I just -- I don't know how to continue from that point.


Again, no, it's not.  I've already laid out the argument.  You just haven't grasped it.


No, you haven't.  Our current dilemma is that I don't know how to re-explain what I've already said in a manner that you will understand.  So we're both left thinking the other doesn't "get it" and is illogical.  I, because you don't understand the concept, and you because without understanding the concept, my further statements seem circular (since they depend on the truth of the concept).
The problem is that I know for a fact that I am correct, but I just don't know how to convey the knowledge to you.  From my point of view, I have shown you what amounts to a purely mathematical truth, each step proven from A all the way to Z, and you have simply looked at it and said "nope not true", and I point out the steps and you say "nope".  From my view, I have simplified it as much as possible, so I just don't know how to convince you further.


It appears that way to you because I am apparently not expressing myself in a manner you can understand.  That baffles me because I believe I have been quite straightforward, but nonetheless it is the reason for your confusion.


This saddens me to read because I am aware of the purely logically derived truth of my words, and I clearly have not expressed them in a manner that has allowed you to see them.
I beg of you, sit and think about this.  Run simulations.  Talk to other professional traders.  I genuinely don't know how to simply what I am saying, but perhaps if you show this conversation to somebody else who understands the concept I am attempting to convey, they will be able to convey it to you in a manner you will understand.  Since you don't understand nor believe me, I know you won't like taking my word for it -- but since logic does not convince you my word is all I have left -- and I promise you that what I am saying is correct.  Please, talk to other traders, explain to them your position, point them to this conversation.  I really REALLY want you to understand this.  It will help you.

That's not a proper analogy.  With dollar cost averaging, you are betting incrementally over time, not at the same time, and you don't know what the future is.  A better example, using your roulette analogy, is that you previously bet a unit of money on black and (won/lost), and are wondering what you should make your next unit bet on.  The past history is irrelevant.  Your current bankroll and the variance of your future bets is what matters.
To use more gambling analogies, many people consider "hedging your bets" to be sound variance reduction, but the hedge bet should be made on its own merits, understanding its own variance and its own expectation.  You should not make a -EV bet simply to hedge a previous bet.  (Of course, you may want to sacrifice EV in order to reduce variance -- some sports bettors take a slightly -EV hedge in order to "middle" a game if they find the opportunity to do so, so that they get a guaranteed payout rather than a sporadic but more profitable average payout.)
However roulette was a very good example to exemplify a situation that has the same expected value but much different variance.  Betting $1 on red has the same EV as betting $0.50 on black and $0.50 on red, but those two options have significantly different variance.

Incorrect.  The jet analogy just doesn't hold.  **With bitcoin, it's not possible to understand what bitcoin does without understanding how it works.**  Therefore, you have to understand how it works before you are qualified to comment on the usefulness of what it does.  If you think you know what bitcoin is and you don't know how it works, you don't actually know what bitcoin is, all you have is a surface view of one of its applications.  And of course you won't think much of it, because like you said, people can use Paypal and heck Paypal is faster.  That one application, without context, seems unimpressive.

yeah, there's lots of neat things about bitcoin that aren't really known about or "main stream" yet.  pretty much everything done in the entire financial industry can be done, and done better, by bitcoin.  and most of the problems can be solved by bitcoin.  i know that seems like a bold claim, but it's really true.  an entire industry can be made obsolete by a few thousand, or even a few hundred, lines of code.  this progammable scripting that bitcoin has, along with the revolution of the distributed blockchain ledger that everybody can trust without a third party, really can do everything big finance does right now.  and it can do it in a cheaper, faster, safer manner, with 100% proof and accuracy, and no corruption or mistakes or possibility of theft.
and that's just one of many reasons why i think bitcoin is so damned amazing.  that same provable distributed accounting can be used in other areas.  namecoin for example uses a bitcoin-like ledger to map domain names to IP addresses.  so you get 100% perfect dns records with no chance for MITM or government redirection or blocking.  bitmessage allows people to e-mail directly peer to peer without any servers by using a rolling blockchain.  there's so many applications for this technology, im sure we havne't thought of most of them yet.

all social systems involve trust, because any time you communicate with another person, all you have to judge their intentions is their actions and their words, whereas they have access to the most important vector: what they know their intentions *really* are.  that aside, cryptography fixes pretty much everything else.  you can mitigate all other dangers.  you can use multisig addresses with mutually assured destruction to make it more costly for somebody to screw you over than to be honest.  at the end of the day though, yeah, no social structure is perfectly safe because *people* are involved, all with their own different intentions and expectations and deceits.  i can use PGP to e-mail you, but you could still go send the plaintext to the feds after you decrypt it.  cryptography isn't supposed to provide perfect security.  that's not possible, because humans just aren't reliable.  what what crypto CAN do is make safe everything else, so you mitigate your risks as much as possible.

if you have a deck of cards and you pull a card from it, the chance you pull the ace of spades (randomly) is 1 in 52.  if i cut the deck in half and give you one half to pick a card from and dont let you touch the other half, the chance you pull the ace of spades is still 1 in 52.  with half the deck as your choice, you can break that down as half the time you'll pull the ace 1 in 26, and half the time you'll get it never.  but because you don't know which half it's in, there's a 50% probability on any given half, which means your chances are 50% of 1 in 26 plus 50% of 0 in 26.... which equals a average probability of 1 in 52.

i recently [made an app]( to do just that
your "normal" addresses begin with the chain m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 and you just increment the last zero there up by one to get the next address.  change addresses start at m/44'/0'/0'/1/0 and again, you just increment the last number up by one.  do that until you have all your keys.
that format (m/44'/0'/0'/0/0) is bip0044 format, and not every wallet that uses bip0032 will use it.  bitcoin wallet for android for example starts at m/0'/0/0 and m/0'/1/0 i believe.

i like bitcoin, it's the first and it has the most hashing power behind it.  it *should* be the top dog.  but there's no reason for the hatred and fear of altcoins.  those who think altcoins debase and devalue bitcoin or otherwise undermine the scarcity aspect don't understand how economics works.
it's both irrational to hate on alts and it undermines the open source nature of the bitcoin project as a tool for innovation.  the only reason to hate on alts is because you're purely a bitcoin speculator and alts steal a modicum of value from the bitcoin price.  and pure speculators can go fist themselves into bloody oblivion for all i care.  those parasites can tell themselves they're important for the ecosystem all they want, but at the end of the day, they're still just parasites leeching on the productivity of more capable men.

ah, right, because hashing isn't nearly as susceptible to any quantum attacks.  which makes not re-using addresses a viable solution to quantum computing attacks (assuming miners count only the first received tx as valid and you can propagate your tx fast enough.)  very good point!

$100K per coin is an order of magnitude too high.  Remember the value of a bitcoin doesn't need to take into account the derivatives built on top of it, only the actually needed monetary supply.  $100K per bitcoin implies a market cap of 2-4 trillion dollars, which is as I said at least an order of magnitude higher than it needs to be to reach world wide adoption.  I think $10K a coin is very optimistic and the best case scenario, and I would estimate bitcoin ultimately stabilizes in 20 years in the $3K to $6K (current value) per coin range, which in 20 years with inflation would be about $15K per coin.
There's my official prediction.  $15k per coin in 2035.

you have to do it via git.  you can't just download the zip.  but if you have git installed, git clone into repository, and then use the command "git checkout" followed by the commit hash.  so it should look something like this:
    $ git clone 
    $ cd ./bitaddress.org
so now you've cloned it and are inside the directory.  then run:
    $ git checkout d56c505885aa5a5881145548068fe88b8e0966da
That's the hash for 2.9.3.  So after you run that in the directory, the folder will be a git clone of the 2.9.3 files and you can verify the hash with the pgp signature.
You're right to be confused though.  It's bad that he updated the github repository without an easy method for newbies to verify the site's hash, especially since "file save-as" doesn't work to get the right file, and so the only method to use a verified copy is by using the github source code.
[Here's]( a zip file of the source code at 2.9.3.  You can verify the main directory html file but I guess you'll have to trust me for the rest of it.  I guess you can just copy/paste my html file into your downloaded 2.9.5 source and hope not much of the other files have changed in a way to makes it not work.
EDIT:  Nevermind, you can use the HTML file alone by itself with no other source files.  So just extract the HTML file in my zip, verify it, and you're good to go.

I don't think it is, because blockchain.info lists multisig addresses normally.  It would have just showed the multisig address beginning with a 3 as a normal address, wouldn't it?  For example, [here's]( a deposit into a multisig address, and [here's]( money leaving a multisig.  It displays them just like normal addresses.  The OP link is most certainly not doing that.  Or is it and I'm wrong?  Is there a reason you think it's a multisig and just displaying differently?  I don't know the technical aspects, so you might be entirely right, but the reason I don't think so is because it displays multisig's differently in those links.

If you want the convenience of LastPass, that's OK, but don't act all high and mighty like that's clearly the better option.

that happened in march when the blockchain forked briefly.  during the fork, for a while the longest chain was what is now the invalid chain.
somebody pulled a successful double-spend on okpay, which at the time let you keep a bitcoin wallet.  they deposited during the fork, the "wrong" chain happened to be the longest for a few confirmations, then they immediately withdrew it, and double-spent their original transaction with an insanely big fee.  then miners started switching to the "real" chain, and his double spend became the valid tx, and the okpay cashout was a valid tx (since it came from okpay's pool of customer funds and didn't rely on his tx in), so that got confirmed too.  boom, he just executed a double-spend attack on a tx that had something like 3 confirmations.  **EDIT:  no it had TWENTY confirmations before the "real" chain came back to overtake the other chain.  holy shit**
so no, you don't have to cash it out.  you just go in and out of a big bitcoin exchange and bam double your money.  AFAIK that's the only successful double-spend a a tx with more than a single confirmation ever in the history of bitcoin though, and it happened because the entire network happened to be literally forked down the middle AND everybody decided to switch to the chain that didn't have the tx in it.  in essense, he had the entire network at his disposal to do the double-spend.
lesson is, wait for tx to confirm AFTER a crisis is over.... which thankfully in bitcoin means like a few hours at most.  it's also why block rewards can't be spent for 120 confirmations... that's a "ridiculously long time" in order to make sure that the block is actually real and not orphaned.

YES.  YES WE ARE.  In fact, that's what the law means.  It's why illegally obtained evidence isn't admissible, and why the burden of proof for criminal prosecutions is *beyond a reasonable doubt*.  We KNOW we let bad guys walk a LOT of the time, but we accept that as the cost of living in a society that tries its best to not jail innocents and that holds the rule of law as so important that nobody is above it, not even those who are supposed to protect us.  We accept that extra risk of harm and crime in exchange for not living in tyranny.  Sure we could all be far safer if we were jailed in solitary confinement and had our every movement tracked and planned for us, but we don't want total safety.  We want freedom of movement and action and thought, and whatever amount of safety we can reasonably have without intruding on those most fundamental of rights.

it's an entirely different scale though.  think of malleability like a bullet.  all exchanges were told "hey wear a bullet proof vest" and gox didn't, so they got hurt when they got shot at occasionally.  then they published their statement, akin to giving a ton of hackers guns, and now all exchanges have a flurry of bullets flying around all the time.  not even a vest is gonna protect against that.
i know it's a weird analogy, but it's the best i could think of.  in the end, tx malleability will just get fixed altogether, and bitcoin will be completely bullet-proof, even against a flurry like is happening now.  but you should note that bitstamp not being able to handle to sheer volume of fake tx's is a different issue than not being prepared for tx malleability originally.

incorrect.  what i agreed to was that steganography cannot stop an ISP from throttling any and all traffic without prejudice about what the traffic is.  steganography CAN prevent an ISP from *selectively* throttling traffic, because steganography prevents the ISP from identifying what the traffic actually is.


you are correct that if an ISP just throttles 100% of traffic that doesn't originate from its own IP, stengaography is not useful against that.  steganography masks what traffic actually is, so it is useful when an ISP selectively throttles, but if an ISP just throttles all traffic, then you are correct that nothing can prevent that.

I think you make some good points, but you are clearly wrong here from a game theory perspective.  If governments were just god-awful, the people would revolt.  They have to do enough to placate the masses-- to keep them comfortable enough to prevent them revolting.
That being said, I think it's still ridiculous, because governments aren't thinking entities, they are giant bureaucratic blobs formed by a mesh of **people**, all of whom have different motives and different abilities.
I don't have much data to back this up, quite simply because there isn't any, but I think it's because this is simply the nature of bureaucracy.  Bureaucracies by their nature are too big and require too many moving parts, and as you move from point to point in a bureaucracy, there is degradation-- miscommunication, individuals sabotaging it for their own benefit, etc etc etc -- and so ALL bureaucracies by their very nature are grossly inefficient.
Until now, that inefficient blob was the best would could do.  It wasn't perfect and it had a lot of problems, but it WAS still a cohesive blob, we have did at least HAVE a functioning society and government.
But that's no longer necessary.  Bitcoin technology means that we can have large complex systems which are very efficient and have perfect communication and have economic incentive towards honesty.  That's insane.  It's a revolution.  For example, read half way through the 4th paragraph of [this post](


We can have an entire society, government and taxes social services and all, done with this technology.

it may also just be spam.  it's a cheap way to clog the network up, since it costs so little money but the size of the transaction and power to process that transaction is the same as any other transaction.  (ok a little more since it's a bigger tx).  a few years ago on some altcoin i forget which, somebody was sending so-called "dust" continuously, and blocks were bloated in size and the network almost ground to a halt because there were simply too many too big transactions.  that's in fact why the satoshi client devs made dust outputs non-standard, so that most clients wouldn't relay them and the network couldn't so easily get clogged up like that.
@_date: 2014-10-08 05:07:35
Yeah, as you say, it creates new addresses, but the big deal about HD wallets is that all the addresses are linked together.  You can't tell that by looking at them-- so like blockchain analysis couldn't link one address to another (unless there were transactions between them), but under the hood, in the way they are generated, they are linked.  So you only need to remember one key, a "master key" and you can derive them all from that.
So an HD wallet is a way of having a safer and more privacy friendly wallet -- one that doesn't re-use addresses -- but which you can still access the money for all the addresses in it, by simply remembering one master key rather than the private keys for every individual address.
For example, let's say I had a private key that corresponds to a bitcoin address.  And then I take the sha256 hash of that private key and use it as a private key for a new address.  The addresses don't outwardly appear to be linked in any conceivable way-- but you know that they are linked by sha256 hashing.  So rather than remember two private keys, you can just remember one private key and then that you have to hash it to get the next private key.  So you can keep generating private keys that way, and still only need to remember the first key in order to be able to recreate them.
That's not quite how HD wallets work, but the concept is the same.
HD wallets also have a neat property where if you want, you can prove that two addresses are linked like that, but without revealing their private keys.  You don't have to prove it, and nobody but you can prove it, but if you want to show that they are linked, you are able to do so.
So now imagine like a company that wants to give various departments a master key to control the funds for the department, and the ability to *verify*, but not spend, the funds from other departments.  Each department can get its own master key and derive private keys and addresses from that, and they can also derive the public addresses from the *master public key* of the other departments.
So there's all kinds of neat applications, only one of which is allowing you a privacy-friendly wallet that doesn't re-use addresses, and which can be backed up with just a single master key.

That's exactly what deniable encryption is for.  It wouldn't help for Lavabit's case, but if you live in the UK, you should be using deniable encryption.
Deniable encryption and steganography are often over-looked and under-valued aspects of encryption.  Encryption is certainly useful, but as we should all have learned, meta data is extremely useful, and in some places like the UK for example, they can lock you up for not decrypting your encryption... or for having random data which you obviously cannot "decrypt".  So having deniable encryption so you have *something* to unlock whenever somebody think you have something encrypted is useful, and steganography is even better so you can hide the fact that you're using encryption at all to begin with.
This is why everybody should use encryption and run Tor when they can, even if they have "nothing to hide".  Privacy tools need to be common place so that the mere act of using them doesn't warrant suspicion.  The larger the pool of users, the less any one user can be found.  You want Tor to be faster and less susceptible to spying?  Run a node!  The more users there are, the more bandwidth there is available, and the harder it is to control X% of nodes and attempt to trace users.
The shameful part is, we have the technology available, but nobody uses.  That's why the guys working on things like the Tor Browser Bundle and Bitmessage are so soooooo important.  Making crypto dead simple to use is what brings in users.  People will use it if it's easy enough for them to use, but the *aren't* willing to put in any *effort* to learn if it's difficult.  So our job is to make it usable.  Expanding the frontiers of encryption is neat and all, but more people really need to be working on bringing what we already have to the masses in a usable form.

The default state should be one of neutrality towards transactions.  A valid tx is a valid tx.

in part yes.  but also in part because due to its wide-spread use and popularity, it garners immense scrutiny from the security community at large, and all it takes is one person making public a vulnerability for everybody to become aware.  in that context, absence of evidence serves as evidence of absence, and the sheer volume of known vulnerabilities in other OS's as compared to those known in Tails is highly suggestive of it being far far more secure.  and that's just talking about vulnerabilities.  it's also far more secure just in its setup to begin with -- a lot of its design stops potential vulnerabilities before they even begin (which of course is the point).  again, i must point out that just because something might not be perfect doesn't mean it's not the best option there is.  if you hear it's riddled with security holes, POST THEM.  let people become aware of those holes so they can be fixed.  but since you're full of shit, i dont expect that to happen.

here's an example.  you have the password "testing123" and generate the intermediate code
    passphraseazvxwtvrkrUid7ph3xxXrhFBxtauUnZxYsJE2NWkS5YQPCy4wrE5PRmc7FwGi4
you give that to the guy making wallets and he generates the address 
    1HvXhrobKzvjYDdKM1zQYfDDNwXXSoFX3C
and he gives you the confirmation code 
    cfrm38V8gZ7r3PEnW1RH8VSpCToupRgzPLyhb5s3JNxGuQ6rA26tttZSt1bpbq9zvo5S4M2o4j4
which you can use to verify that indeed the address was generated using your passphrase.
you can then get the private key for your card and see that it is the encrypted private key
    6PgQ2kwsaqcmuQoA5WqFyTyQecHgMdff3QDywXksWwHiYaBiL8fULMrFhV
which can only reveal the actual private key with your password.  the other guy could create the address and teh *encrypted* private key, but at no point was he able to create the unencrytped private key.  so for things like casascius' coins, where you never see the private key until you need it, the confirmation code serves to verify that the public address was actually created in this manner.  but even if you have the private key available, the confirmation code also serves as extra proof that the intermediate phrase was used to generate the address.
for my example i was using casascius' bitcoin address utility to do everything.

Even if you find the example a poor demonstration of my argument, my argument itself remains intact and as strong as ever.




You're still blaming the victim.  Would it be good to not do stupid things, and to lessen your chance of being the victim?  Of course it would.  But the core problem is still the *crime* itself, and the *criminal* himself.  The blame isn't on the victim for making a mistake or doing something dumb, the blame is on the criminal for taking advantage of that.  Or heck, maybe the criminal is mentally ill and there's no one to blame.

Alright, since you asked!  [Here's]( the script with my stealth functions I made.  The bottom two functions are the relevant ones where I actually needed to reference how you guys did stealth.
You can see it's just a bunch of functions-- I only recently started trying to force myself to do class objects where appropriate.  I started out doing what is apparently called procedural-based programming-- i.e. literally everything I did was step-by-step, no objects/classes involved.
In fact, that's still true for [the module]( I imported at the top of that script.  That module still only has a bunch of functions and no objects.
You'll also notice that a lot of my script has to do with converting inputs and outputs.  In my first few weeks, I got tired of the interpreter yelling at me, so rather than fix my code, I decided that all my functions should be able to take any input, and output any output, so I'd stop having to actually make sure my variables were correct.  I also liked having things in hex strings, because early on, I kept printing the outputs to see if they were correct, so you see that I often have things in what the code calls 'hexstr' format.  (And you'll notice in many functions, I can specify the output format.)
Terrible practice I know, and I'm trying to get away from it, but that would mean basically re-writing everything, which I haven't brought myself to do yet.
Anyway, there's the script since you asked for it!  The last two functions are the main ones that actually derive the keys.

To be fair, he "took the fall" for a few reasons.  One: he open sourced Bitconica's code with their Gox API key in the clear, which is what caused the hack.  Additionally, he released it while the company was in the process of being bought out, and it wasn't his right to leak it.  Then as the fallout was happening, part of his response was that he was more concerned about the little guys who lost what they had than the guys like Roger Ver who had a lot of money on there because they could probably afford it.  The statement may have been well-intentioned concern about the little guy, but it pissed a lot of the community off because it was adding insult to injury from the very guy who fucked up to begin with.  The notion that he's some pawn in the Bitcoinica scandal is ridiculous.
Don't get me wrong, Amir has won me back over.  But he's not some saint or fall guy.  He's immature and narcissistic and out of touch with reality about a lot of things.

Luke's argument is that he's only blocking spam and he's protecting full nodes and miners by doing this, and a not insignificant portion of them agree.  This is a systemic problem in the Bitcoin community that a large portion of people who contribute to maintaining the network (full nodes and miners) feel they have a right to decide what they store on their computers and how much space they use.  I *understand* that argument but I very much disagree with it.  The entire purpose of Bitcoin is to be an uncensorable ledger that frees the world to transact in any way they see fit.  And just becuase you don't like dust or gambling or mastercoin doesn't mean it's right for you to try to block them.
But a lot of full nodes and miners disagree and think it is their right to do that.  It really is a war for Bitcoin's soul.

i appreciate what you're trying to do... but quite frankly, bitcoin doesn't need ambassadors. it doesn't need banks or regulators. it doesn't care what people think of it or what they want to do to it.  as long as miners keep processing transactions, and people use mixers and coinjoin so any black-listing is useless, then there's nothing anybody can do to stop it.  i dont care what regulators want, or if adoption is a little slower because it's illegal.  the point of bitcoin is freedom and that's exactly what it provides.

to be fair, shorter confirmation times are less secure.  for example, assuming the same hashing power on both networks, double-spending one 10 min block is just as difficult as un-doing ten 1-minute blocks.  faster "confirmations" don't make it more secure.

Once again, you demonstrate that you do not understand how logic works.  Russia's history is actually not relevant, since neither Snowden nor Russia had control over the US revoking his passport mid-flight.


No, I just pointed out that the *facts we know for sure* indicate that what you say *isn't possible*.


All of the releases that have been shown publicly by the media have been carefully fact-checked, and the government has been able to comment on and disprove them if it wished.  Many of the stories also involve outside companies which have confirmed the stories.  And a good amount of it also would be trivially easy to disprove.  Not things like capability -- you can't disprove a negative -- but many other things, like published classified e-mails and such.
Sorry but your opinion is akin to, although not on the same magnitude as, denying evolution.  All the evidence is there.  Your choosing to dismiss it doesn't actually change the facts.

They used to be.  Now there's enough people sending tx's that you have to fight over space in the blocks, and send a few cents worth of fee for each tx in order to get it confirmed right away.  For very microtransactions, you really do kind of need to use Dogecoin or Litecoin or something.
On the one hand, it's good because it means bitcoin is taking off, but on the other, it really highlights one of the scaling issues.  I don't mind so much, because I don't mind using multiple currencies, but it is a little bit of a blemish on bitcoin's advertizing.  I suspect sometime soon we're going to see multi-currency wallets that use bitcoin for big amounts and litecoin/dogecoin for smaller amounts.

I mean, there has to be a boundry of reason.  You can't pay literally everybody because the tx will be so big that the block size limit will be reached and the blockchain will bloat.  Additionally, you can't pay out less than a satoshi for crying out loud.
All that needs to be done is the average person needs to be able to contribute and get some kind of reward in a reasonable time frame.  Right now you can by a half dozen or dozen usb asics for not too much and bink a p2pool share within a few months.  That may not sound like much, but given how little such a miner contributes, that's about as low variance as it gets.
This is also a good time to bring up the fact that small miners should not and *are* not mining for profit.  (Or if they are, they are sorely misinformed.)  They are doing it to contribute to network health, and thus they should not be looking for, or expecting, payouts.  If everybody switched to P2Pool, even small miners would likely never bink a share, but that's OK, because the point is protecting the network, and distributed mining does that.
Heck, I'm solo mining a single USB asic.  I fully expect never to make a block in my lifetime, but I also know that my little bit is still contributing to the overall network health regardless.  If you like bitcoin and you want it to succeed, you have to be a participant in the network, expending some of your own energy to help the greater cause.  Bitcoin wasn't developed so all miners could make money; it was developed so an equilibrium would develop whereby enough miners make enough money that the network is protected.  That means some people are going to mine inefficiently and lose out.  That's life.  The protection of the network is all that matters.

US regulations don't apply to other countries unless there are treaties or the companies are international corporations or any number of other context-specific exceptions where the US is able to have a foot in the door.  In this case, where there is no US involvement, a simple statement on the website of "please check the legality of investing with us in your jurisdiction" is enough.  The US has no authority to regulate foreign companies.  If the foreign companies are serving US citizens against US law but in compliance with their own law, the US *still* has no authority to touch them.  The US can only stifle them within the US.  They can block bank transfers to and from them, *but only from within the US*.  They can go after the individual investors.  But they can't touch a foreign company operating lawfully in its own jurisdiction and providing legitimate international trade.  This has been decided numerous times.  For example, after the UIGEA was passed in 2006, Argentina sued the US in the WTO for the right to provide online gambling to US customers, and the WTO agreed that that was indeed allowed since it was allowed under Argentinian law, and US citizens are allowed to engage in international trade with countries whose laws are different.  **US citizens are allowed to engage in business with foreign companies under foreign law.**  As long as the company is not in the US, the US can declare regulations all they want, but those declarations are not legitimate international law.

If a disease outbreak occurred, you would of course want people to take practical steps to avoid getting it, but you still don't blame the victims of it.  The problem is still the virus.  Even if years of research haven't gone anywhere, it is still right that you should concentrate your efforts on doing whatever you can to curtail its spread and minimize its negative effects.  It is still right that you frame the issue as the virus being the core problem, even while you also are telling people what practical steps to take to lessen the chance they contract it.

it means one of the handful of things that lead to their recent problems has been fixed.
when you "sign" a transaction, you basically use your private key to make a chunk of data that somebody with your public key can verify HAD to have been made with your private key (in combination with the transaction data).  however, part of that process involves using an unused and unpredictable random number.  if you reuse the same number, or if the number can be guessed even occasionally, attackers can derive your private key.  in one of blockchain.info's recent updates, they accidentally made the code that generated a "random" number generate a very predictable number, and that's how the dude who stole and returned every one's coins recently was able to get them.
this deterministic signing basically runs your private key and the transaction data through a secure hashing algorithm, so that, assuming the hash algorithm is secure and produces reliably random output, a new "random" key is guaranteed to be generated every time.  it also makes checking for errors a little easier since you can verify that the "random" number was created properly.

This is why you include the whole message in things you sign.  Anybody else can steal your message, like I did, and use it as "proof" to somebody else that they own the address when they in fact don't.

Bitcoin isn't a currency.  It's a protocol and it's an easily exchanged commodity.  Hopefully its value will stabilize in the future once more people adopt it and its value isn't based so heavily on speculation.  For now, you're allowed to convert to dollars and we won't be mad.
But you are correct about hoping it will become a currency in the future, and for example, a friend and I may be starting a business soon... taking only bitcoin, and using only fixed bitcoin prices.

It's easier to perform a 51% attack and grind it to a halt.  But the idea is that if you have a domain registered on namecoin, you have incentive to keep the system alive and well, and it costs very little on your part to do so.
This is nothing more than pure economic incentive built into the system... but what that means in terms of real world effect is that if the system is being used, it will be very secure, because the people using it have incentive to keep it secure.
This means there is an equilibrium that develops.  If few people use it, it's less secure but there's also less reason for somebody to attack it.  If many people use it, it's more secure (but more reason for an attacker to attack it).
Additionally, a nifty thing about bitcoin-like technology is that one of the aspects of solving the Byzantine General's problem via proof of work is that even an attacker can't change the records.  He can only prevent new records from registering.  He can only *slow down* the network, and he also must do so continuously, because as soon as he stops, the network picks right back up where it left off.  So pretty much any attack is going to cost way more than the benefit of such an attack.  As network security grows exponentially, the benefit of an attack grows linearly... if that.  A far better use of an attacker's money would be to continually by up and then crash the price market of namecoin, causing instability and a price drop, which would simply make less people use it.  That's kind of the best he can do... make people like it less.  He really can't outright stop it or do anything to it.  That's the beauty of bitcoin.
It really is an amazing system.

Of course it is.  Same thing with the alt coin hate.  The people who only see Bitcoin for the dollar signs don't care about ethics and just want to distance themselves from scandal.  They don't want to see possible innovation from alts, they just fear it will hurt the short term price.

changes from one version to the next are highlight in github and other places, and many community members regularly review it.  additionally, there is a rarely used seucrity alert protocol in the bitcoin client which will display a message if one of a handful of people send it out.  something malicious would very quickly be identified and known, likely within a day.  still, it is good practice to wait a month or so after a client has been released before upgrading, just in case.  even hard fork changes are never set sooner than six months after the client implementing them is released.  and remember, bitcoin is a democracy.  if code is bad and it's discovered and people don't like it, they will simply go back to the old client.  if code is REALLY bad and blocks are fucked up or something, miners will start mining on older chains and eventually a "good" chain will become the longest.
in short, yes something as you describe would be a very big hiccup and potentially hurt some people, but it wouldn't destroy bitcoin.  there hasn't been a major network wide problem yet that wasn't fixed within a day of being discovered.  and remember, a lot of people rely on bitcoin and have incentive to make sure it works.  and all it takes is one of them to read the new source code and spot an error and let everybody know.  and there are dozens of fantastic devs besides the main ones who work on the code and look closely and new releases.

Only the person with the password can decrypt the encrypted private key.  The intermediate phrase is simply proof of the password and allows addresses that require the password to be created.  But those addresses cannot be spent with the intermediate code, only with the password, which only one person has.
As for the intermediate code.  No, it can be broadcast publicly.  You can PGP clear-sign it and publish it if you are worried about somebody changing it.  (But somebody could also alter your stealth address when you post it as well if it's not signed.)  Then anybody can create an encrypted key which they cannot spend but only you with the password can spend.
I think you are misunderstanding how encrypted keys and intermediate codes work.

Try having a reasoned argument with people.  Well over 90% of them will not be willing to continue.  They get emotionally invested in their side and stop going because they don't want the pain of confronting their beliefs, or they believe that logic and evidence aren't necessary to their beliefs.
Try having a debate about something that goes against the grain but would still be a good discussion.  What if we *did* arm the teachers in schools?  How much should viewing CP be punished and how much more does an individual viewing really hurt children?  How would an anonymous assassination market play out and what would be the benefits and drawbacks?
I'm not necessarily for or against particular opinions -- I just think those are valid discussions worth having and can lead to interesting deductions and conclusions.  But if you ever try to have those kinds of conversations and you press people to explain and back up their beliefs, rather than treat it as a meaningful philosophical exploration, they dig their feet in the ground and just don't want to talk about it.  They think you're defending some horribleness by asking them to actually account for why they hold the views they hold and bringing up possible counter arguments.
Very few people have genuinely considered their views, and they will forcefully prevent any attempt to reexamine their views or think about them at all.  It's simply not possible to have a reasonable *discussion* about anything meaningful.

We are making the distinction about the nature of *crimes*.  "Crimes" which cannot have a victim are separate from crimes which *happened to not have one this time*.  Perhaps you should take an introductory logic course before we continue so that you are better prepared to discuss this.


Indeed they do count.  And if you can prove how somebody else's dealings had a negative impact on others, you will have proven it was a crime.
Remember, your original post said "no victim no crime" was a naive principle.  You're trying to shift the discussion away from that now and get into a semantic argument, which makes no sense since you're even worse with semantics, but regardless, let's stay on topic.

Thank you!  So few people are willing to do that, yet it's *exceedingly* useful.  People think it's less valuable because it's not realistic, but in fact it's *more* valuable because it forces them to enunciate their positions very clearly and make sure they are logically consistent.  It also teaches you how to adapt to new circumstances, since you've already spent time considering situations you believed impossible.  So often people will not engage with  my thought experiments in order to exemplify the point I'm trying to make.


Thank you for taking the time to engage in the thought experiment...  however I now have the unenviable duty of informing that your decision is in error.  Further, I have to point out that that's not my *opinion* -- it's objectively logically a mistake.


One's past accuracy should certainly factor into his decisions, since he has objective data about his likelihood of being correct... but that's an entirely different thing from his DCA.


It is a fallacy many in the financial world believe.  Most people do not think logically about investing (or anything else for that matter).  Logic in any area is something that really just needs to be trained.  Our intuitive minds are highly subjective and irrational, and although we can never get fully rid of that, we can at least value correct thinking when it's appropriate and seek to be better at it.

nlocktime tx's are considered invalid unless the lock time has passed.  nlocktime can be used right now.  it just doesn't work the way you are imagining.  with nlocktime the tx cannot be mined to begin with until the locktime has elapsed, but once the tx is mined, its outputs can be spent right away.  with checklocktimeverify, a time-locked tx could be mined right now but any tx to spend its outputs would be invalid until the locktime elapses, because the checklocktimeverify op code invalidates the tx when the script is evaluated.  checklocktimeverify is also just an op code so it can be part of a multi-purpose redeem script.  for example, it could make an address a 2-of-3 until some date at which it becomes a 1-of-3 (any of the keys can spend it if it hasn't been spent in X time), or any other weird combo of scripts that rely on a time lock.
so they're a little different, but nlocktime absolutely works right now and can be used the way andreas is describing.
here's how nlocktime can be used right now:  you give me your bitcoin address and the address of an arbitration agent we both agree on.  i create a 2-of-3 multisig with those two addresses as well as my own, and you verify it.  i then send my bitcoins into it.  i then create a tx to spend the multisig funds to your single address, but i make it with a nlocktime requirement, and sign it with my key (1 of the 2-of-3 necessary keys) and ship you the semi-signed tx.  you can sign it now, but since the locktime hasn't passed, it's invalid and won't be relayed or mined.  so you just have to sit on the tx until the time has elapsed.  if before the time elapses i want a chargeback, i create a new tx to spend the multisig funds, with a higher sequence number and no locktime, and send that signed tx to the arbitration agent to sign.  if he signs and broadcasts that tx before the nlocktime tx i sent you can be mined, then his tx will be mined and your nlocktime tx will be a permanently invalid double spend.
nlocktime also means that any nlocktime tx can be double-spent by another tx before its locktime, whereas checklocktimeverify tx's can be proven to be encumbered until the lock time expires.

everybody is allowed to make changes to bitcoin by creating their own client, or forking another client, or just submitting ideas to the github pages for the main clients.  gavin and a few others control the actual updates that go into the most commonly used bitcoin client, and most people view that client as the "official but not really official because there is no official" client, and most people trust gavin et al enough to upgrade to his version of the client whenever he publishes changes.  but he has no authority to demand they do or that they use what he writes at all.  miners and users are free to not upgrade or to use other clients.
there is no one person who decides how bitcoin works or plays out.  the entire network decides.  gavin currently appears to have that control simply because so many people in the bitcoin community trust him and are willing to use the software he codes.  because of his status and his work thus far, and his general likeability, he is the only person who is paid by the foundation full time to work on coding bitcoin.  the foundation has no authoritative or legal weight.  it is just a group of people claiming to represent the interests of bitcoin.
there are no officials in bitcoin-- no official person, no official software, none of that.  the people "representing bitcoin" have "authority", and the software being used is the most common, solely because users trust them and are OK with using that software and letting the foundation speak for them.  (or at least a fair amount are ok letting the foundation speak for them!  there's a very vocal number of people who aren't.)  but that could change at any point.  you can bet if it turns out gavin was fucking with the code, the bitcoin-qt client would die very fast and the most commonly used client would quickly become something else.  and you can bet if the foundation recommends red/white/green/black/purple-listing addresses or something similarly toxic, more and more people will turn on them and the foundation as an institution will wither and die as well.
there is nothing "official" in bitcoin.  no people, no software.  only the protocol and the users who collectively agree that the protocol is valid.

when you send money to an address, you are sending money to the *hash* of a public key.  bitcoin addresses are actually hashes of keys, not actual keys.  the public key isn't revealed until that money is actually spent.  so in order to break an address, you'd need to both reverse the hash AND reverse the public key cryptography.  however, as part of spending money, you have to provide the public key in order for it to be hashed and verify that it's the correct key for the address, and then provide a signature in order to verify that you own the private key for that public key.  out of necessity this process makes the public key known, and therefore publicly available to all.  so after you spend money from an address just once, instead of needing to crack the hash and the key, they just need to crack the key, since you've already "reversed" the hash for them by providing the key.

you cant delete an unconfirmed tx.  if the tx is valid and has propogated the network, it will either get in a block, or eventually be dropped.  if it's unlikely to confirm, because it's non-standard or low priority or something, you can create a double spend tx and broadcast that and hope for the best.  otherwise, wait for it to just be dropped by the majority of the network, a few days or weeks maybe, then broadcast your double spend again.

the other reason is the fungibility of bitcoin.  what if drug laws get so draconian that businesses stop accepting bitcoins that are X% tainted with known drug addresses?  and you just got some bitcoins in a legitimate trade with a friend who happens to smoke pot, without paying attention where they came from, and now you can't spend them.  now one unit of bitcoin is not as fungible as any other unit.  that's a problem.  the only way to preserve fungibility is anonyminity, because that's the only way all coins are truly equal -- when they all have no traceable history, just like usd cash.
so there's another important argument to add to the list.

It's really driving me nuts that I haven't been able to do that for you.
Edit: somebody posted a reply and then deleted it.  I won't out the username, but I will quote their reply and post my response to it.  Here is what they said:


and here is my reply:
The history is only relevant inasmuch as it may an indicator of the trader's skill, or in that unresolved traders may not be known currently.  However, you still approach both of those in terms of the information they provide you about the future -- that is, you can quantify your accuracy with a margin of error, and you can assign probabilities (and error rates to those) about the various possible outcomes of the unresolved trades.
But you are still making your decisions within the context of your present circumstances and your predictions for the future.  The past doesn't play a role, other than the role it played in bringing you to your present circumstances.  If you had $200 yesterday and lost a hundred, or if you had zero yesterday and gained a hundred, you still have $100 to work with today.  It doesn't matter how you got to that point, because you still have exactly the same amount to work with.  Now the other circumstances in your life and your goals in investing may be different if you started off richer or poorer previously -- but once again, you're still making your decisions based on your current circumstances and what you are trying to accomplish in the future.  Your feelings about the past may change what your goals for the future are, but there is no actual objective reason that the current situation is any different.
The past only matters inasmuch as it contains information that you can now presently act upon.  Whether you won or lost money may change your present circumstances, and may give different kinds of information, but the wins and losses themselves are not objectively valuable in terms of any additional strategic info.  For example, if you've lost half your money, you may decide to invest differently from this point forward, because you have different expectations and goals about what you want to happen in the future -- different expectations and goals than you would have had had you not lost all that money.  But the actual loss itself isn't actionable in any manner, it just happened to put you in your present situation.  Your investing strategy should still focus on what your current situation is and your attempts to influence your future situation.  What happened in the past doesn't actually change the logic of that process, the process of assessing your current situation and determining how best to influence your future situation.
Does that make sense?  Am I explaining this clearly?

The intermediate code is the "stealth address" and the encrypted private key is the "nonce".  You give the intermediate code out publicly, people randomly create an encrypted private key which they also know the public address for, they post publicly the encrypted private key, and you can decrypt it and get the money, and no observers can tell anything about the sending or receiving address based on public information.  Exact same functionality as stealth addresses.

it's likely nobody can predict it with enough accuracy to make any kind of specific predictions.  BUT there are more and less reasonable speculations.  for example $20, is orders of magnitude farther away from $420 than $1000 is.  additionally, given the continuing rise in use of bitcoin, and the relationship between all the relevant factors with the price--- while i can't know for sure of course, i think it's *significantly* more likely to be at $1000 next year than at $20.
dont get me wrong, im the first to call BS when people claim to know how to predict the price or what the reasons for this or that price are, but saying that there is literally nothing we can glean, or that $1000 is as likely as $20, is simply not true.  i dont know if we can know enough to make specific enough predictions to profit more than hodlers to any measurable degree over that time period, but we can know *something*.  and one of the things i think it's within the bounds of reason to claim is that $1000 is a far more likely price than $20, a year from now.

Incorrect.  It is entirely true.  It is a certainty that digitally hiding things is more secure than a comparable physical hiding algorithm.  The search space for something hidden digitally is simply much much greater.


My point is that that's true no matter the method of security.  They could also tail you when you go physically hide cash.  Both digital and physcial security methods can be thwarted by various back bag techniques by adversaries, but in an apples to apples comparison, digitally hiding something is much more secure.  If they *don't* follow you when you physically hide something, there is some chance, even if it's a small one, that they may still find it without the use of those blackbag techniques.  If they don't keylog/watch/whatever you when you encrypt something, it is pretty much impossible for them to ever decrypt it without just waiting for you to decrypt it yourself and using those same blackbag techniques in the future.  Money can be thrown at finding a physical object and having some degree of success.  The same is simply not true for encryption.
When comparing their relative strengths, digital security far surpasses physical security in every way.  The fact that both are susceptible to being watched or black bag ops doesn't change that.
@_date: 2014-12-15 19:47:48
im not a dev, and we're getting on the threshold of my knowledge, but i was under the impression that Bitcoin Core already treated high S values as non-standard, and if malleability is an issue, then we should just make high S values not *valid* any more.  i understand that's a huge leap and a soft fork, but the point is there's plenty of solutions to tx maleability as you point out with BIP0062.  so that should not be used as an excuse to not implement a potentially useful feature -- although it's a valid reason to *delay* said feature until maleability is fixed.
but you make a fundamental flaw in the claim that my argument is an argument *agaisnt* it.  a time-locked tx is completely different from an unspendable tx that is polluting the utxo mempool.  a time-locked tx is intended to be spent.  in the end, after it is spent, it takes up exactly the same amount of space as it would if, using current nlocktime procedure, the input tx wasn't included until very close to the time of using it for a new tx.  so the only space you save is a space over a threshold of time.  in the end, the space is the same.
my argument is simply that the usefulness of not having to manage the tx yourself, or to rely on the party spending it to hold onto it, is worth the cost of that added space for the interim time interval.  the whole point of bitcoin is to remove trust where possible, and if you want to create a timelocked tx that you know can't be counterfeited before the lock time, currently there is no way to do that.  with checklocktimeverify you can lock those inputs of that tx so they can't be double-spent before the time expires, while also ensuring the output can't be spent yet.  that's an important feature for time delayed transactions.
your counter-argument is basically saying that bitcoin shouldn't do those types of time-locked transactions -- and i feel the need to point out that the world's most secure ledger should be used the way people WANT to use it.  it has real value, above and beyond what you personally want it to be used for or not used for.  time locks are useful and good and add value.  OP_RETURN is good and adds value.  hell even dust spam forces people to decide where their values lay and create a market solution by choosing to set your dust threshold at a certain point.
bitcoin has to be flexible enough to be used the way people want to use it.

Cryptography and incentives.
Go talk to free marketers and anarchists.  You'll find they aren't against rules, they're against *force*.  They are still happy to live in civilized society, they just want it to be *voluntary*, not enforced by the point of a gun.  Basically, an \*actual\* contract rather than the social contract so many people think should be binding.  Here's a snippet from an e-mail I sent to a friend:


In a free market, there would be many small exchanges, all with different rules and all with various measures of protection.  There would also be a Better Business Beaurau type of thing and Insurance if there was demand for it.  For example, there is already bitcoin insurance available.  They just require you to keep your bitcoins with them, since if they don't have them, you could just say you lost them.  And there are already services that allow you to do multisig contracts, where multiple people must sign a transaction for it to be valid.  There are also exchanges that keep one share of a multisig key, so they know you can't run off with the money and claim they scammed you but they can't steal the money either.  Then they send you a transaction you must sign any time you do a trade.  And soon, there will be distributed exchanges that use cryptographically enforcable contracts for everything.
The thing is, in a free market, you can CHOOSE how much or how little risk you take.  You can opt to use Joe's Scam Exchange, or you can use another exchange.  There will be many many small exchanges with various rules and methods of doing business.  And you can see how they use crypto to enforce those rules, and how they partner with other better known and trusted entities in order to garner trust where crypto isn't available.
You can also choose to work with a business that operates in a city like the one I quoted.  A city with all the rules and laws that exist today in most first world nations.  Such a city is entirely possible in a free market anarchy society.  It's just not the \*only\* possibility, and it's entirely voluntary for all its citizens 100% of the time.
You are asking questions about how to protect yourself from an entity like Mt Gox.  The problem is, unless YOU personnally do it yourself, then you are simply moving your trust from Gox to somebody else.  You're still trusting other people.  And that's OK-- you just need to be aware you're not actually safer, you're just changing who you trust.  A free market allows you the freedom to choose where you place your trust, or to trust nobody but yourself.  There are no rules saying you MUST trust some entity or you'll be imprisoned-- unless of course you agree ahead of time to abide by those rules.
Will there be more scams in a free market?  Yes.  But the legitimate busninesses will prosper far better, and be far more trustworthy, than the current system, where the rules simply restrict how much a business can screw you.

That's the wrong mindset.  The "first they came for.... and I didn't speak up" mindset.  You don't care about them because you view their transactions as "bad" by your definition.
But they are valid transactions.  You personally don't have to mine or relay them, but the purpose of the Bitcoin network is to be censorship-free.  I also feel that they are spammy and clog the blockchain, but they are *allowed to do that*.  You don't get to decide that they are spam.  You can post about how spammy they are and *offer* patches and rally to get the majority of users to update.  But sneakily turning on a patch that blocks certain tx's by default is censorship pure and simple, and goes against everything that Bitcoin stands for.

That can never happen.  Ripple serves a purpose already fulfilled by legacy banking, and which is distinct from what Bitcoin does.  Ripple also, while better than banks, is not even remotely close to the original Ryan Fugger design of a distributed trust-based lending networking.  XRP and the Ripple blockchain are a bad mix of the wrong things to serve a purpose that's already fulfilled, and importantly, it doesn't actually move the trust model in any meaningful fashion.  (They claim it does but the mathematics of its setup don't agree.)  There is a near zero chance that it will overtake either Bitcoin or the legacy financial institutions.

That has bounds of reason to it though too.  When you walk into a room, you "assume" there will be air in it for you to breath.  That's a reasonable assumption to make, and it's one you make without realizing it, because it's just always been true.
I contend that that's the same for digital security.  Most people have always done it a certain way, which has always been good enough, and it's not their fault for realizing the situation is different with bitcoin when by all outward appearances it looks the same.
Either you concede that it's not their fault, or you concede that bitcoin simply isn't ready for mainstream adoption and is only suitable for tech-savvy people who should know better.

Not only can you prove a file exited before a certain date by uploading its hash on the blockchain, you can prove it was created *after* a certain date by including a recent bitcoin block hash in the file's meta data or content.  You can thus have a time-stamped "window of creation" for a file.
If I ever write a book or article, the end of it will be something along the lines of "The hash of block X is Y, and the hash of this document itself will be included in the OP_RETURN data of a future tx.  The earliest such instance of that tx, or of any similar cryptographically secured and time-stamped proof of existence, shall be considered the original and true copyright/timestamp, and whosoever can sign a message with the sending address of the earliest tx shall be considered the true creator of the material within this document."  Then when I publish it, the "published" doc will be a zip file with the document itself inside as well as with a text file that has info on the time-stamp transaction.
Voila, instant before AND after time-stamp, and proof of copyright, while still being able to be anonymous.

Would the following algorithm work?  I'm not close to an expert on any of this.
* Let G = the generator point
* Let k be a random number in the order.
* Let Qa be the recipient's public key, and da be his private key.
* Let m = unencrypted message
* J = k \* Qa
* M = E(m,J) be an AES encryption of m with the key J.
* S = signature of M (or of hash(M)) using key k
* Ciphertext = ( G\*k, M, S )
* Decryption uses the key G\*k\*da (which equals k \* Qa = J), and signature can be verified with G\*k
It seems to me to be a lot easier to just use ECC to find a shared secret key in the same manner stealth addresses do, and then use that key for a symmetric encryption, rather than actually trying to break the message up and run each block through some convoluted ECC scheme.  One thing I learned from the few crypto classes I've taken is *"don't implement anything yourself, use standard protocols and libraries."*  So I think this method is likely to be safer because all I'm doing is deriving a shared key.
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:09:46
The only formal argument in that paper you linked is that making more complicated hashing algorithms is slightly more annoying the validate, which could theoretically discourage running a full node.  However the purpose of using more annoying algorithms is to appease miners who (wrongly, I actually agree with you on this) think ASICs are bad for some reason.  So the effect is to actually encourage more full nodes (small stakes miners).  Obviously in the end it won't matter, as the only way to truly make it ASIC resistant is to do what Vertcoin does, and change the algorithm continuously, which is a huge centralization risk.
In short, the argument makes sense, but there's no data to back it.  There are on the other hand a lot of people who commit their GPUs to ASIC-resistant currencies and like the fact that it tries to be ASIC resistant.
However, and I'm shooting myself in the foot here by pointing this out, there is an argument the paper doesn't make, which is that attempts at ASIC resistance hurt the overall security because they keep the hash rate less and de-incentivize ASIC manufacturing from everybody *except* a determined attacker who could then control a higher share of the mining power because nobody else has ASICs.
But again, the available data seems to suggest that miners prefer ASIC resistance, so I still view its use as more of a practical appeasement to the user base -- the theoretical costs in security and in verification times are basically moot points.  It's like saying 512 bits is more secure than 256 bits.  Yeah, it's true, but who fucking cares, 256 bits is fine.
That being said, while I'm still arguing for Ethereum here, you have made me think about and agree with you that ASIC resistance is misguided and that the general thesis of your paper is correct.
The argument about block times follows basically this same line of reasoning.  You argue that it's wasteful because reorgs happen more often, so memory and bandwidth are wasted.  And I can't argue that that's wrong because it's not, but again, my point is that it just doesn't matter that much and so if the users prefer it, then it's fine to do it.  The wastefulness is part of the cost of mining, and for users, it's part of the cost of using it.  But the users are the ones who *want* it, so if they are happier screwing themselves over, it's fine to let them, since in the end it just doesn't matter much.
So both lower block times and ASIC resistance as far as I can see are mostly style-choices, because the problems they have just aren't very big problems, and importantly, the user base *wants* to make that trade-off.
But from a technical standpoint, you are indeed right so far.  I really hate losing arguments, especially after I was sure enough I was right to make a snarky comment, but you've given ample reasoning to support your position so far, and I can't just go denying good evidence and logic...
As for the voting -- ya nope you're totally right there too.  God damnit, I concede, you win.  You are absolutely right and I retract my snarky comments from earlier.  Thank you for providing clear evidence and reasoning to support what you said.
I disagree with only one thing, and it's one thing I vehemently disagree with you on -- multiple implementations.  I think having only one implementation, and the risk of centralization due to who can control that implementation's code base, is far worse than the problems that arise from a bug in one implementation.  Additionally, having multiple implementations means that a bug in one doesn't affect consensus since the other implementations will keep on going.  I genuinely don't see how you can be against multiple implementations.
But ya, on everything else, you're absolutely right.  Damnit.

One can be against censorship and agree that all uses should be available for Bitcoin, while still hoping that people try to *think* about what is appropriate before doing things.  OP is *allowed* to do things that way, and I wouldn't want to introduce any kind of censorship mechanism to stop him because that's a worse problem... but OP's system is still needlessly wasteful and I can appeal to him to find a different method of doing things.  It uses the blockchain for something that just doesn't need the blockchain.  The only reason you need a blockchain is for timestamping, so you can prove the order of events.  Messages either don't need that or already implicitly have it because they are responding to previous messages.  Bitmessage is a far better system -- messages require POW, so there's little spam, and all messages are forwarded on a best effort basis for two days.  There's no need for a blockchain.  So using a blockchain unnecessarily is just reckless and harmful.

there would be a few days of panic and insane price swings, but within a few hours, one or more hard fork releases would come out with a checkpoint sometime recently and a new hashing algorithm required.  and within a day, the community will have decided on which one they want to use.  and within a few days, everything would be fine again.
those few days though, they'll be rough.
that being said, the history of 99% of algorithms being "cracked" is that they just get easier and easier to crack and more theoretical weaknesses get discovered which reduce the brute force space.  so the far likelier scenario is that the community decides to switch before there's ever a problem.  for example, some weakness could be found and now sha256 can be cracked in 2\^100 time or whatever, which makes the community nervous enough to change algorithms.  that's the most likely scenario.  we switch long before any attacks actually happen.

And I stagger my amounts.  If I want to do $2000 worth of trades, I do $500 worth, and then when that trade is complete and the coin is in my possession, I do another $500.  You can mitigate risk as much as you want by using arbitrarily small values.  If the time it takes to do that is too much because you're a day trader, then you simply have not yet understood that your day trading profession inherently comes with more risk than you realize, because part of the cost of doing business that way is accepting that the exchange might go bust, and you need to add that risk into your profitability expectation calculations.

Please don't use the blockchain for e-mails.  That will bloat it so much.  This is exactly the purpose of Bitmessage and why it uses a ROLLING message cache, and messages aren't protected by miners but by the computing power of the sender.  All messages need POW behind them and are forwarded for two days on a best effort basis.
It's a fantastic setup, and far preferable to using a permanent ledger that everybody must keep in order to send a temporary message that only one other person needs to see.
I get that you're "allowed" to do it -- Bitcoin must necessarily be open to all uses, otherwise you introduce central censorship -- but please PLEASE think about the network and the effects of what you're doing before doing that type of thing.  Try to find better ways.  For example, if you want to prove ownership of a document, make an OP_RETURN tx with the hash of it, and sign things with the input address.  Then there's only a few extra bytes on the blockchain, and you can forever prove copyright of that arbitrarily big document.
Similarly, use Bitmessage.  The order of the message doesn't matter, and the other person still knows it's from you if you sign it, so putting it on the Bitcoin blockchain is just wasteful and unnecessary.

In my scenario, the document is said to have been "born" into existence in the time-stamp window.  It is assumed to have not existed before then.  In that manner, you can age it because you know its birthday.
I know of no way to verifiably after-the-fact age a document besides doing that.  In order to do as you said, wait 10 years, I cannot show the work to anybody else, because they could timestamp it in their name.  The work in effect exists to no one but myself.  In short, the information doesn't actually exist anywhere.  It's useless *until it's published*.
Can you think of any scenario where it would be beneficial to an author to not only wait 10 years, but wait 10 years *and also purposefully not be able to prove he had waited 10 years*-- because remember, the time stamp can be made to reveal no information about the document itself.  Only the hash goes in the blockchain, and that's not reversible.  So nobody actually knows what the hell the time stamp is until the document itself is known as well.  Is there any situation where it would be preferable to sit on information and purposefully not protect it and purposefully be unable to prove you had been sitting on it?
I think saying a document is "born" at the time-stamp window, and assume it didn't exist before then, is a perfectly fine method.  If information has any value at all, then the only benefit is to try to show you had it at an earlier point in time, there is no benefit to prolonging its release.  And if you do want to release it at a later date, you can still time stamp it now, and just not release the document.

yeah I'm not worried about multiple diffierent forms of things being cracked at exactly the same time.  in the history of those types of things being cracked, there's always been notice of researchers citing concerns that theoretically reduce the search space-- it's almost never been "zomg it's completely broken and here's how".  even md5 for example hasn't been reversed, it's just that there's a large number of rainbow tables for it, and it's a computationally easy function, which means you can churn through hashes really fast.
but i mean, what you're talking about, to really fuck up bitcoin, is a hash function AND an unrelated signature function to get *broken*, i.e. reversed, and at exactly the same time.  (because even if they happen at different times, we can still switch signature/hash functions)  the likelihood of that happening is almost non-existent.

1.  doesn't matter.
2.  also doesn't matter.  even 51% attacks are thwarted by waiting for 12+ confirmations.  all of the double spend attacks that a 51% can do have to be done within a short time frame, because a part of the currently protocol is both that the longest chain is the valid chain, and also that nobody can publish more than like a dozen blocks in a row to suddenly have a new chain become the longest.  so even side-mining a longer chain isn't feasable any more.  so as long as you wait for a dozen or more confirmations, double spends are no longer an issue.  as for double-spends on things like everyday purchases at fast food and vending machines and so forth-- well the rarity of such events is what matters.  it's going to happen to infrequently that it almost doesn't matter.  the effort required to do the double spend simply isn't worth the little bit of money you save.  and for larger transactions, again, you just wait for a few hours worth of confirmations before considering the money as yours.  only thing a 51% could do effectively is block transactions from being confirmed.  but other miners would confirm tx, so in effect, confirmation times would just slow down.  nothing to fret about.  also the attacker would have to *continue* doing it, because the moment they stop, confirmation times  will pick right back up.  additionally, there is economic incentive NOT to.  with all the money it costs to do such an attack, the attacker would be better off just mining and making free monies.  so it's unlikely to happen because there's incentive to play honest.  isn't bitcoin great!?  if a government or somebody wanted to stop bitcoin, they wouldn't do a 51% attack.  they're money would be far better spent slow buying up bitcoins on markets then flash-selling them, crashing the price... then doing it over and over again.  that's a far better use of resources than 51% attacks.  because then you permanently get people to stop using bitcoin because they simply don't have confidence in it.  in short, even a 51% attack does almost nothing and isn't anything to worry about.  if you're going to worry, worry about price/market manipulation.
3.  will get less over time.  simply due to the small size of the market, and so any big influx or outflux of fiat swings the price.  once enough people use it, no one entity will have the ability to move the price, and the "market" also won't move the price as much, because the market is just the psychology of the people using bitcoin, and a giant mass of people are slower to change their collective mind than a small number of people.  for these and so many other reasons, volatility will logarithmically decrease over time.  bitcoin is simply new, so it swings.  as it matures, it will swing less.

non-violence only works because of the threat of violence.  if non-violence is practiced by all, then any player can simply decide at any time to use violence to unilaterally improve his conditions at the cost of everybody else.
non-violence can only ever be achieved when there is a game theoretical threat of the use of violence.  that is, if you know im not armed, you can just arm yourself and rob me.  but if you know that im armed, and i know you're armed, you and me both will continue to act non-violently with each other because of the implied threat that the other one is fully capable of defending himself.
now this may not work on every individual level, because people do irrational things all the time, but in aggregate, if a technology exists, it is absolutely imperative that EVERYBODY has access to it, in order to keep everybody in line.
now you'll tell me "surely you wouldn't want to give nukes to everybody, because some crazy terrorist might be willing to kill himself to nuke a city", and while that's true, my whole point is that non-violence can only exist in the world because nuclear technology has spread out enough that no one power can use it to take over the world.
the other argument you can make is that game theory doesn't matter because humans are generally decent and benevolent dictators are possible.  but for me, history pretty clearly donstrates that that's not true.  our capacity for love and kindness is mirrored, and many anthropoligists think directly related to, our ability to hate and hurt, and boy do we demonize and hate out-groups to the same degree or more that we care for and love our in-group members.
so i still claim as valid my original point:  from a game theory perspective, non-violence is only possible when there is an implied threat of possible violence, because otherwise any player can just use violence to achieve his will.  if you take away all guns, there may be fewer shootings, but you also subjugate all people to the will of criminals willing to use guns.

You misunderstand.  I don't mean OP will fuck *this* up.  I mean the fact that this question is being asked means OP lacks so much understanding of bitcoin that even if this particular question is adequately answered and OP executes paper wallets perfectly, OP is still likely to fuck *something else* up in the future.  OP's question doesn't merely convey lack of understanding of paper wallets, but of bitcoin in its entirety.  It is therefore dangerous for OP to even be using Bitcoin at all.

which is why, if you had read my post, you would see that the time-locked tx is a MULTISIG address that i fund first.  THAT's what prevents me double-spending the nlocktime tx, the fact that i CANT because it's a multisig.
checklocktimeverify would allow me to do what you say without a multisig, but it is still possible to securely do what you want using nlocktime+multisig.
read my whole post, it describes a secure way to do with nlocktime what you are claiming can only be done with checklocktimeverify.


incorrect.  again, if you'd actually read the post, you would see how to use nlocktime plus multisig to solve that problem.


i know, that's why you keep spouting incorrect information.  if you'd read the post, you'd see that what you're saying can actually be done without checklocktimeverify.


no, it was explaining the differences.  however, you claimed those differences prevent nlocktime from accomplishing what you want.  that's simply incorrect.  a 2-of-2 multisig address where i sign a tx (1-of-2) to send you money but with an nlocktime encumberance is the same as a normal address tx to send you money with a checklocktimeverify encumbrance.  it's just that with nlocktime I'd need the intermediary step of putting it in a multisig.  that's how i prove i can't double spend it, whereas checklocktime verify proves that inability by having the script itself invalidate if the locktime hasn't passed.
but you can still accomplish that same feat of provably encumbering money before the locktime, with nlocktime+multisig or checklocktimeverify.  it is absolutely possible right now to do what you want to do without checklocktimeverify

but it seems disingenuous to call their lives and their struggles failures, since so much of the difference between them and the uber successful is pure luck.
how many people have been told they need to grow up or take fewer chances with their lives, but who are no different than their successful counterparts and merely got unlucky?

@_date: 2014-09-21 06:17:43
Yep, that's the incentive structure with deflation.  You have to value things slightly more than their actual cost.  Whereas with fiat (and inflation), you want to spend as much as you can, because your money will be worth less tomorrow.  So you buy say two months worth of food at Costco because you know you'll need food in two months and spending your money now is better than not.
Not necessarily saying that's bad, it's just the incentive structure.  Inflation creates a higher velocity of money, but at the cost of slowly draining the wealth of most people.  Only those who buy deflationary assets or otherwise are able to spend their money in such a manner as to buy or create enough value to overcome inflation will end up better off.  The majority of people will find that that "saving" is a bad proposition, and it's only valuable because when they spend, they spend on things that depreciate even faster.  So inflation hurts most people, but keeps the economy moving, because the velocity of money keeps relatively high, since everybody needs to get rid of their cash before it becomes worth less.
Deflation helps more people, but it also makes changes in the economy more difficult, since people are more hesitant to buy things.  So it's harder to get the ball rolling on good changes.
I think overall deflation is far superior, since people's wealth doesn't get raped by trying to be more financially responsible and save.  And no matter how much incentive against spending there is, people still need to eat and have shelter and be entertained, so the economy will never just stop-- there will always be *some* velocity of the money.

I've been thinking about this for a few years, and teaching myself to code, but I'm still a ways away from actually writing anything.  I think I've got most of the kinks worked out, and sidechains can do some things even more efficiently.
The big problem is when the other people collude-- not in cards, not normal collusion -- but in transaction collusion.  The key to solving that is that the valid hand is the longest chain of signed actions in that hand -- but then you still run into problems with disconnections and other stuff.  You can also partially mitigate cheating attempts by having the entire table burn more than they sit at the table with in an nLockTime tx that can only be double spent by the current hand -- but again, you don't want a disconnect to then cost the table all their money.
I'm going to keep rambling if I don't wrap it up, but suffice it to say, there's a lot of kinks to get through, but there's a number of ways to solve each of them, and I think I've got a framework that addresses every issue in my head somewhere, but I haven't written it out yet.
Once I progress a bit further in my learning Python, I will write a pseudo white paper just for an outline to follow for coding.
Most of the seemingly interesting problems like proving the deck was fair without knowing the cards ahead of time, have already been solved.  It's the nitty gritty of the details of the hand that are the most annoying from my thought experiments at least.  My general approach is an "everything is a transaction" approach, (with modularity in mind), with a main chain processing non-hand money movements and game type tx's and WoT ratings, and then a table-instance side-chain since hand actions need to be near instant, and then you also don't want to have entire hand history files clogging up the main chain, so they can get pruned once the table side-chain pays out back into the main chain.

Yeah, there's two different forms of bip38.  The first one is just password protecting a private key, which is awesome in itself.  But the other one is that you can use a password to generate a temporary code that you can give to another person, which they can use to make an encrypted private key for you that they could not have had access to the original private key in order to make.  So somebody else can make an address for you.  The purpose of that was for casascius's physical coins.  And since the encrypted private key includes a nonce called "owner entropy" which you provide in your temp code you give them, you can verify that the encrypted private key they gave you was created via that method and isn't just some random other encrypted private key they do have access to.
(I'm teaching myself python, and as part of my learning, I implemented the full BIP0038 specification in Python, so I know all about the ins and outs of bip38.  I'm hoping to release a Py Casascius Bitcoin Address Utility sometime in the near future, as well as my own "enhanced" utility with extra features, like stuff with mnemonics and stealth addresses and stuff.  It's mostly for practice, but it's interesting stuff.  I have the actuall "address utility" app part almost completely finished.  [Here's]( a pic of it in Ubunutu with the Win7 ubuntu theme.  It's Python using PyQt4.  I have all the underlying functions for the other functionality written, but haven't made the GUI yet.  I wrote almost all the functions myself from scratch rather than using any available libraries, because again, this is for me to learn.)

Yes I did, but apparently I need to do it again...


If the rich man makes less than 5% margins, he is forgoing the opportunity cost to simply lend out to the poor man at 5%.  However the main difference is that the poor man paying the 5% doesn't lose $100M when the business fails, whereas the rich man who self-finances loses everything when the business fails.  The 5% can be thought of as insurance, just that the poor man *has* to buy the insurance.
Additionally, you haven't actually address the monopoly issue.  You *think* you have by merely stating the word "monopoly" but like the other guy, haven't actually shown how it works.
If the rich man continually undercuts competitors by having margins less than 5%, he is losing money by running that business instead of getting into the lending business and making 5%.  A monopoly must be maintained and it is only useful to have a monopoly if that's the best financial decision.  And once again I must point out that I've already address this in my previous post where I explained that in our current corporatocracy, monopolies can indeed spend $1 to buy laws that force consumers to pay $1.50, and they can artificially maintain the monopoly at a profit -- but that's not true in a market system.
Please, do list whatever advantages you think the monopoly has, and I will happily explain to you the ways in which you're mistaken.


actually thought out and logically consistent..?
Indeed there are a few key points to make about the differences between the rich guy and the poor guy, and there are a few specific advantages.  But both you and the other guy have only gotten to the incorrect first conclusions that most people also wrongly think.  I'm interested to see if you intend to actually think through your arguments and arrive at the *correct* counterargument to my claims.  It *is* possible for you to win this -- there are a few advantages the rich man has that make his wealth position strictly dominant over the poorer man's...  You and the other guy actually have the correct opinion, but just for the wrong reasons.

No, the multisig address is just a hash of all of the public keys that comprise it.  For example, a simple 2-of-3 multisig address would be:
    OP_2 + length of 1st pubkey + 1st pubkey + length of 2nd pubkey + 2nd pubkey + length of 3rd pubkey + 3rd pubkey + OP_3 + OP_CHECKMULTISIG
OP_2 is the number of key sigs needed to unlock, and OP_3 is the total number of keys.
Bitcoin at it's core, when it "verifies" transactions is really just running a simple script and seeing if the script validates to "True".  So with normal addresses, the script is akin to "check that this script signature is valid for the transaction, and that it is the signature for the correct public key, and that that public key is the correct public key that corresponds to the right bitcoin address" and if all that is true, then the transaction validates.
But there's another type of pseudo-address called P2SH, which stands for "pay to script hash", which instead of validating the address, validates ANY arbitrary script, and as long as the requisite keys within that script sign the transaction and meet the requirements for whatever the script is, it will validate.  And it's called P2SH because instead of the "address" being the hash of a bitcoin public key, the address is just the hash of that arbitrary script.
So let's make a multisig.  If we use the three random compressed keys:
    0387997583CFF12A1D881AD0FA44F6FE4AD138B9139258CEC089537DD34CA2D7DC
    022E6FC8AFE34EC0A0529CC6719375A9578BCD319675E1C46EE70E4A666C608790
    02F757B278B520A3EFA8DA4E06BDA42CDA2B4D29D6BB2B6AD2D3BD568DFBD4BC03
as well as the [info from the bitcoin wiki]( on which bytes represent the OP codes, and we use the format I talked about at the beginning, we can construct the following script:
    52 (OP_2) + 21 (the hex of 33, which is the number of bytes long the public key is) + 
    0387997583CFF12A1D881AD0FA44F6FE4AD138B9139258CEC089537DD34CA2D7DC
    + 21 (again, the next key is 33 bytes long) +
    022E6FC8AFE34EC0A0529CC6719375A9578BCD319675E1C46EE70E4A666C608790
    + 21 +
    02F757B278B520A3EFA8DA4E06BDA42CDA2B4D29D6BB2B6AD2D3BD568DFBD4BC03
    + 53 (OP_3) + AE (OP_CHECKMULTISIG)
and we get a final redeem script of:
    52210387997583CFF12A1D881AD0FA44F6FE4AD138B9139258CEC089537DD34CA2D7DC21022E6FC8AFE34EC0A0529CC6719375A9578BCD319675E1C46EE70E4A666C6087902102F757B278B520A3EFA8DA4E06BDA42CDA2B4D29D6BB2B6AD2D3BD568DFBD4BC0353AE
then we take the sha256 of that, and then the ripemd160 hash of that sha256 hash, to get a final hash of:
    90923433AA41248DB093652A0F9F570AE6C888D5
then we put an 05 version byte in front of it, since that's the convention for multisigs, and we base58 check-encode it, which results in the base58 string of:
    3EsSNbNC353LsxWaoyViSUHHfw4QmnK4f6
which is the address for the 2-of-3 multisig create using those three public keys.
So as you can see, the only way for a person to determine the multisig public address is to know all of the public keys that were used to create it, since the address is nothing more than a hash of all those keys.

He has done great work no doubt, but to frame Bitcoin in any way that implies it has a "chief scientist" or any person who "decides" what happens to Bitcoin is the wrong mindset to have about Bitcoin.  The popularity and prevalence of the Bitcoin Core reference implementation is already centralizing Bitcoin too much -- we really shouldn't be encouraging people to *think* about it in a centralized manner as well.  Bitcoin has no chief scientist.

storing data on the blockchain requires extra space that every full node has to keep.  for data that needs that permanent space that's ok-- that's the point of the ledger.  but if the data you have *doesn't* need to be permanently and always available and viewable by everybody, then you are burdening the nodes to keep it without gaining any benefit.  it's a net loss and waste.  transactions must be permanent because you must be able to follow the path back to their minting in order to be sure they are valid.  document hashes stored in OP_RETURN outputs must be permanent because the timestamp of the hash embedding matters when determining authorship.  that has value, and being able to do that is useful and helps people, as does financial transacting without limitation.
there's a variety of very good uses for a permanent public ledger...
but e-mails -- messages which don't need to be stored very long and which only need to be viewed by a small number of parties -- are NOT a good use case.  they gain no additional benefits by being on such a ledger.  therefore, it's a net loss on the system, since no benefit is gained but a cost is incurred.

correct me if im wrong, but im pretty sure that's not a feature of elliplic curves, that's just a feature of the math of brute forcing things -- that it takes sqrt(n) time on average to find a key in an n-bit sized keyspace.
also, exposing the public key isn't really that disastrous, because it's not like you're searching through the public keys to find a hash collision and then starting over to search through private keys to match the public keys separately -- you do it all in the same search, you churn through private keys to find corresponding hashes.  so you'd never be searching for a individual public key, because it's a 256 bit search space.  you'd instead churn through private keys because you want to match *any* of the 2\^96 public keys that produce that hash value.

Yeah the SIGHASH_SINGLE returning 1 is a huge deal because it means you can copy and re-use somebody else's signature, so if that address receives money in a later transaction, you can create a tx with enough of your own inputs so that there are more inputs than outputs, and then use that same signature to claim those new funds from the victim's address.
Anybody using anything besides SIGHASH_ALL should really REALLY know what they're doing.  Using SIGHASH_SINGLE for an index greater than the outputs is akin to publishing the private key for that address.  The address can no longer be used.

What do you mean "fraudulent transaction"?  Even a successful attacker cannot forge transactions.  Tx's still have to be valid for nodes to accept them.  Otherwise they're just forking bitcoin and mining their own fork that nobody but them uses.
All an attacker can do is grind the network to a halt by not mining transactions, and by performing double spends, and some other weird and insanely hard attacks that don't need to be worried about.  But they can't *forge* transactions.  That's public key cryptography 101.

you also need to be careful with address correctors.  i built one, and rather than being useful what happened was i found a LOT of very similar addresses and almost send money to an address with no private key. my correcter works if you have the length correct and mistype the checksum, but if you don't know the exact length, it will often find address 1 more or less letter, which of course have entirely different hash160s.

    1NVF8JqWPa9ECpo5WwQXviHps9yjopsyy
You can do that with any address.  It's fucked up.  Just change the length by 1 and then decode and ignore the checksum and you have an entirely different hash160.
(This is because the address is just a big number, represented in base58 format, so an address that's a character more or less is a power of 58 higher or lower, which when represented in hex, of course changes all of the characters to different digits, since it's a different number.)

honestly it doesn't matter.  ethereum only needs *non-zero* value to be valuable.  as long as somebody makes a platform to connect key mulitiplication with ethereum contracts in order to make a provable ethereum-bitcoin exchange, then you can create contracts in ethereum that just have the first execution condition being "start when account X has Y money in it".  hell you wouldn't even need to do the money in ethereum coins, the contract could just be fulfilled as executing a very cheap tx which has data in it which is a nonce-password to unlock bitcoins for some party that has another part of the password.  ethereum coins would just be like namecoin--  super cheap, and primarily the means to execute the underlying code.  their value would depend solely on the value of the usefulness of the ethereum protocol and its differences from bitcoin, which would make people WANT it to work, which would make them WANT to mine it in order to protect and promote that protocol, which would drive up the price of the ethereum coins.  and if it uses double sha256 and 10 minute blocks, it could also be merge mined with bitcoin!
so even if somebody has 90% of the coins, the coins primary function isn't a store of value, it's to faciliate the protocol.  you can own 20 namecoins and that's what like $100, but it's enough to register all the domains and id's and other stuff you could possibly want for many years to come.  because namecoins aren't valuable as money, just as a means to execute the namecoin protocol, and they've found an equilibrium where they have enough of a price tag to get enough miners to protect the network to a reasonable degree, but still low enough to serve the purpose of namecoin and allow cheap name registrations.
"coins" are just data transfer protocols on distributed blockchain technology.  andreas keeps talking about how money is jsut the first app-- he's right.  bitcoin does literally nothing except prove that the bitcoin protocol actually works.  the tokens serve no other purpose.  well that's gonna change really soon here.

His private keys were generated in a non-random manner by Blockchain, and the attacker had already pre-generated a list of non-random keys that might be generated if such a fuck up occurred.

my confusion is stemming from the fact that you're wrong.
cryptography absolutely prevents throttling, because encrypted data of one type can look like encrypted data of any other type.  therefore, you can mask the type of data you are receiving by using encryption.  a common current example is using a VPN in order to get better Netflix speeds.
now then, you claim that that can be thwarted by simply throttling all encryption as well.  steganography is the art and science of hiding the fact that you are using encryption in the first place (or rather hiding that you are using any other means of communication).  the example i gave was a movie file that truly is a movie file-- it plays just fine -- but it also contains extraneous encryption data.  another example is compression algorithms that include error correction, and error correction bits can be used to mask data, and from the outside it just looks like a normal file with a slight corruption that the error correction fixes.
in order for an ISP to selectively throttle traffic, they have to be able to identify the traffic they want to throttle.  so you use encryption.  if they throttle all encryption, then you use steganography.  steganography allows you to *appear* to be sending and receiving only normal unencrypted things while actually secretly using encryption.  and "steganography" is a catch-all term for varying types of methods of hiding encryption in plain sight.  there's no one algorithm that ISP's can look for.  like i mentioned earlier, Skype uses a specific type of encryption formatting that is easy to spot, and it uses that so ISP's that DO throttle encryption can not throttle Skype so that their customers can still use Skype video without problems.  so what did somebody do? they made a plugin that makes Tor traffic look like Skype video.
so how exactly are you claiming ISP's can selectively throttle?  they can just bulk throttle all encryption and random data.  but how are you proposing they defeat steganographic techniques in any manner other than a continuing cat-and-mouse fight with cypherpunks?
you said it's "trivially" easy to see that "steganography cannot be used to prevent your ISP from throttling".  im saying you're flat out wrong about that.  please, do explain how it's so trivially easy to spot steganographic techniques.
steganography absolutely 100% CAN be used to prevent an ISP from throttling

your inability to understand the post does not in itself negate the post.  many more people would have to fail to understand it, or data would have to prove it wrong-- those are things which negate the post.  your failure and ad hominem attacks do not fall into either category.

i lean very slightly in favor of guns, although i don't mind stricter regulation.


no, im saying that non-violence is only possible when there is an underlying threat of violence.
and in fact, i pointed out specifically that nukes are already distributed enough to fulfill that game theoretical requirement world-wide.


neither.  those are two different scenarios, with vastly different variables involved, and in which different measures are likely to be best in each.  my only point is that generally speaking, in a all-encompassing view, non-violence only works when you are capable of violence.  individual situations may vary, since other actors may be able to fight on your behalf, or certain actors are more or less likely to be prone to unprovoked violence, and any number of other variables.


see my first point in this post for why that doesn't matter.  that being said, that comment in particular annoys me because it pains me to think you see me as that irrational, even though i know that's your own failure and not mine.  im quite sure that i have spend far more time actually thinking about and debating my beliefs and the consequences of them, than you have.  your surface deep visceral reaction to my post, and your lack of logic in the ensuing reply, strongly indicates that you have not thought too deeply about the topic.

An escrow service holds the funds and releases them when called upon by the people transacting, and also mediates in the event of a dispute.  But even with no dispute, they still hold the funds.  An arbitration service OTOH merely comes in to arbitrate in the event of a dispute, but is not needed or used unless there's a problem.
If you use a 2-of-3 multisig, the arbitration service does not have the funds, and they cannot confiscate them, and if the transaction goes smoothly, they don't even need know that their key was ever involved.  But if there is a dispute, they can mediate and then give their signature to whomever they declare the the money should go to.  That's basically what [my offer on the SR sub]( is as well.

No, because most people, including professionals in such soft sciences, don't actually have to confront reality with their views.  I've been a professional gambler and trader for many years, and most people simply don't understand basic logic, apparently yourself included.
For example, you don't seem to grasp the simple premise that being wealthy is distinct from not being wealthy in that you are able to control where money is used.  You happen to have that control because you *have* the money, but that doesn't matter.  Having $1000 of your own, or having a super power of commanding others to pay for $1000 worth of things gives you functionally the same control.  That can also be extrapolated to see that the ability to get financing, that is -- the connections and power you have over others -- greatly diminishes any advantage gap between having money and not having money, since you are still able to *control* money.
Further, you don't seem to understand the burden of proof nor the other basic rules of logic, and such denials present no impediment to your happily continuing to believe in the truth of your opinions, even though I have presented a counter argument which you have yet to address.  Your reasoning skills have apparently *so* diminished that twice you have not merely not responded to my argument but *not even seen that it exists*, all the while mocking me.
I know you may not be able to see it, so you'll just have to trust me when I say I will run circles around you in any debate, argument, or test of logical reasoning.
So with that in mind, if you genuinely care about your beliefs and want to strive to make sure you can justify them, I must once again tell you that I will happily continue this conversation... but only after you've responded to my argument.
Edit:  As an example of the wisdom of "professionals", I recently had a long exchange with multiple professional traders who believed that cost basis -- the average amount you've paid for something -- was, in and of itself, a valid metric to be used, in part, in determining your proper investment strategy (assuming your goal is to make money).  That is incorrect.  If the price rises or falls (and thus your cost basis changes), your new present situation may dictate a change in strategy given your goals and risk tolerance, however the cost basis itself, and whether you won or lost money in the past, is a useless and irrelevant metric.  Yet there are many professionals who disagree.  And they are simply wrong.  It is *provable* with logic that it *cannot* be a valid metric in and of itself.

It's a novelty coin.  There's a hologram on the coin, and under the hologram is a private key for a bitcoin address.  A guy named Mike Caldwell, aka casascius, used to make them a few years ago, but got stopped by the government because they thought it might be an unlicensed money transmitting operation.  I don't know why he doesn't still do it with unfunded coins, but there you have it.
Fun historical fact, that coin is the reason you have BIP 38 encryption.  People were worried that the guy was keeping the private keys, so he developed a method of using key multiplication to create a public key that he could prove mathematically that he didn't have the private key to, and in the process, he developed the standard for encrypting private keys.  If you look up the [BIP 38 specification on github]( you'll see he is the author.

The value of the protocol depends on the security of the protocol, which depends on the hashing power committed to it.  Miners will stop mining if it's not profitable, which means it has to be above a certain price for the network to have a certain minimum level of security.
It's a feedback loop that feeds on itself.  The more people who use it, the more secure it is, and the more useful it is to those people.  The more people who come into the system, since the supply is fixed, the price must rise to accommodate the value that needs to be able to use the protocol.  To make an extreme example, if an individual wants to be able to transmit $10B with bitcoin, the market cap has to be at least that in order to accommodate that need.
So the price will continue to rise as long as more people find value in the protocol, which raises the profitability of mining, which brings in more miners, which raises the hashrate, which makes the network even more secure for *everybody*.
So while your student is technically right, and while it is true that anybody can copy the protocol and make another altcoin, the reality is that there MUST inevitably be one dominant coin, because the usefulness of the network is linked in a feedback loop with the popularity of the network.  So there will be one main coin, and it will continue to rise until it reaches equilibrium with the total worldwide value of the network for all its possible uses.
Which is a very very long ways away.

well no not single-handedly. everybody who has similarly poor security contributes to the problem.  ive even begged google to give me the option to disable, and ahve it give it a nice big red warning popup when i do, but alas, "for my own safety" i cannot.  the problem is a systemic cultural issue of delegating responsibility.  i understand the allure of not wanting such responsibility, but i still wish services would give me the option to opt out of their insurance-type policies.  i understand that's not feasable for a lot of regulated things like banking and such, but it is possible in many places, like for example it would be nice to have the option of opting out of suspicious IP login prevention on a google account.

@_date: 2014-09-27 00:14:08
The problem with that is that most consumers see no chargebacks as a negative.  You and I understand that products include an extra cost for insurance against chargebacks, among other things, and that assuming we are somewhat careful about who we do business with, saving that cost is better in the long run.  But most people simple think the price is the price, and why use Bitcoin when their credit card protects them against the merchant screwing them over.  And that's not an unreasonable view.  From their point of view, handing their credit card number out and paying more is fine-- because for the paying more, they don't consciously notice, and for the leaking their information, well it's insured so what do they care.
It really is a mindset difference.  Between people who don't want to have to think and are OK delegating their security to others, versus people who want that control for themselves and are willing to expend the effort and brain power to be able to do it.

Incorrect.  Having a majority of hashing power can prevent money from being spent, and it can undo confirmed transactions.  But it can't just arbitrarily take any money and give it to itself.  It can double spend it's own money or block other people from spending.  But it can't create invalid transaction.


Of course there is.  When I give you a $20 bill, you have no idea what its history is.  As far as you know, it magically materialized in my hand.  You don't, *can't know*, its history.  The money is neutral and fungible.  You don't know anything about it, and you expect to be able to spend it the exact same way as any other $20 bill could be spent.

Yes, everything you said is correct (except about me understanding how bitcoin works)
My point was -- as you said, that once a miner mines something, you **have** to store it if you want to run a full node.  That's the whole point-- even a small minority of miners can still get unpopular tx's into the blockchain.  That's one of many examples of how Bitcoin is resistant to censorship.  That's the *principle* behind it -- censorship resistance.
And saying you don't have to worry about censorship attempts just because they aren't targeted at you -- that goes against the whole purpose of Bitcoin.  Those censorship attempts probably won't succedd, but that doesn't make censorship attempts any less morally wrong.

So as far as the law goes, it matters how much they know about the encrypted data, and how it is decrypted.  If you have a biometric lock, like eye scanner or thumbprint or something, or say a key file ona  usb stick (and no other password), you can *always* be legally compelled to use that to unlock data.  There is tons of precident for using things you have to unlock your stuff.  OTOH a password that you have memorized counts as "testimony", so the 5th Amendment protects against that.  Any "secret in your mind" is protected.  HOWEVER, if the police already have evidence enough to know what you have encrypted, courts have twice ruled that it's NOT protected -- that is, since LE already knows what's there, it's not self-incriminating to give it to them, so the 5th Amendment doesn't apply.  So the money or bitcoins in this case, would work the same way -- they can legally compel you to produce it without legally violating your rights, but only if they can prove you already have it.  So for example, an encrypted wallet file that stores *public* addresses in plaintext and only encrypts the private keys would be evidence that you do have those private keys, they're just encrypted, so revealing your wallet password would NOT be protected.  But if you had had full disk encryption and they didn't even know for sure if you even had bitcoins, then you couldn't be legally compelled to decrypt the entire drive.  If through other means they know for sure you have private keys on that computer, technically they can compel you to decrypt the computer and retrieve only the keys.... but I don't know about you, but I'm certainly not going to trust my computer once LE gives it back to me.
It's also extremely rare to be in jail contempt of court for longer than a few years, so unless your case is super high profile, if the entirety of evidence against you is encrypted and the sentence for the crime is more than say 5 years, I'd probably just take contempt of court even if they claim they are allowed to compel me to decrypt something.  But that is a risk-- you are allowed to be jailed indefinitely, and the past decade has shown the US DOJ to be more dickish than ever, so who knows.
General rules of thumb:  encrypt EVERYTHING.  Never talk.  And most importantly, for your encryption, USE STRONG PASSWORDS.  Police may not be able to legally compel you to give up your password, but they are very much allowed to try to break it themselves, and they have a reasonable amount of ability on their side to do so.  Anything that's not at least 20 random chars is a bad password.  Whatever neat trick you think you thought of -- it's not going to work.  If it's not truly random, it's not a good password.  Period.  You're just going to have to spend the effort to commit a handful of truly random passwords to memory.  You don't need many-- a password manager can do most of the work for you... but then you need to protect that password manager with your life.  But the password for the password manager, and for your full disk encryption, you are just going to have to memorize those.

don't worry.  unless you send them to a wrong address, or an invalid/provably unspendable address like an OP_RETURN output or something, you can't actually *lose* bitcoins.  you can get them stolen or forget the password to unlock your wallet, but you can't just outright **lose** them via unconfirmed tx.  bitcoin is nothing more than a public ledger, so either you put an entry into the ledger or you haven't-- you can't just pull money off the ledger into oblivion.  that's not possible.  all you have to do is double spend that unconfirmed tx.  go into the debug window and, if your wallet is encrypted type "walletpassphrase password-goes-here 30".  walletpassphrase tells it you're unlocking your wallet with the password, then next is the password, and 30 means keep it unlocked for 30 seconds and then re-lock it, (which you can also do with the command "walletlock").  then when your wallet is unlocked, type "dumpprivkey 1BitcoinAddressHere" and then after it spits out a private key, type "walletlock".  Then import that private key into another bitcoin program and double spend the money into a new address in your wallet, and you'll be good to go.

No, but if somebody used an HD wallet to create the keys in a multisig, you could create new keys from their HD wallet if you knew their master public key.  You can also just re-use the same keys from another multisig address, assuming you know them.
You could however manipulate m-of-n secret splitting such that you'd need 2-of-3 groups of 2-of-3 people each to do something, although I don't know that you'd be able to use a P2SH for that.  But that type of splitting is definitely possible.  You just split the main secret into 2-of-3 shares, then split each of the 3 shares again.

Such a tool is not possible.  You can't prove a negative.
The way you "prove" you don't own an address is to use very clear human-recognizable patterns that are more likely to be chosen by a person than as a random output.  (Yes, I know a seeming "pattern" that was actually randomly generated is just as random, but you get the idea.)
Which address do you think is more likely to have a known private key associated with it:
    1BitcoinisAPeerToPeerDigitaLDcWdZJ
    1DBVRsjsPgwa5NJLs73cNyg3hYetdTYucU
That's a judgement call, I can't prove it either way.  All I can do is continue to *fail* to prove that I **do** own one or the other.  Given that addresses are hashes of keys, and thus can't be reversed, and given that public keys can't be reversed into private keys, it seems unlikely that I was able to go from a private key to a public key to a hash160 that forms a base58 address with such a human-recognizable pattern as the first address... but it IS possible.
The reality is that I own the private key for neither.  The second address was made by changing one character of the hash160 of the first address.
But I can't prove that I don't own the private keys.  All I can do is not provide them and profess that I am being truthful.

Indeed I have.  I relay and solo mine all valid transactions.  I don't have much mining power, and haven't yet found a block, but I absolutely contribute my little bit.
However, it's important to note that whether or not I do that does not help or hurt the argument I am making.  The merit of my words does not depend on my hypocrisy.
You are right though that it is a shame there is not a good client out there to do that.  You have to download the source and [manually change the isStandard()]( function, make sure you don't change settings that mine *invalid* transactions, and then also follow the insanely difficult build instructions.  I'm not a developer and it was extremely difficult for me to do.
There are a few pre-built clients for various things, but not for this.  That is indeed a shame.  I'm sure there's a good chunk of semi-lay users like myself who are capable enough to be miners but not so capable as to be able to do everything they want to do.  However, many things like the minimum relay fee and dust size and so forth can still be changed in the config file, so users who want to contribute can change a little bit at least.
And I'm not providing my own build because I had trouble building it and tweaked some shit and don't remember what all I did, so I can't in good conscience hand it out and say "here use this", but I share your totally not sarcastic concern that there isn't an easy option for those who share my views to be able to implement them.

I like you Plato but you're wrong in this.  You as a miner are free to make smaller blocks and not accept tx's.  Limiting those factors for everybody else is the **opposite** of utilizing market pressure.  Market pressure is no size limit and miners compete and find the equilibrium for size versus fees.  If a 1TB block is mined, other miners can just not build on it and create a longer chain without it.  Additionally, storage capacity and price continues to get better and better.  The cost of storing the blockchain in 20 years is likely not going to be as prohibitive as you seem to think.  And again, you are free no just not mine transactions.  You are free to not use relay mechanisms which relay large blocks just as fast as smaller blocks.  The market will decide what it wants.
You give the satoshi dice example of blockchain abuse...  That's a good example.  What happened?  Most miners refused to mine them, so it took hours on average to get into a block, and users got annoyed by that and stopped playing on the site, which gave rise to just-dice.  That was a market-solved problem, without enforced blocking of satoshi dice.  Now satoshi dice has very few transactions and it's not a problem.
Why do you think enforcing artificial limits will drive innovation more than market competition without such restirctions?  Economic theory and the past evidence of things like satoshi dice's demise seem to disagree.  What Gavin is proposing is free, what you are proposing is more restrictive.  Gavin's proposal is most certainly NOT the direction of socialism, it's the exact opposite.

i actually did just that in Python recently.  i took an xprv key, extracted the last 32 bytes, made that into a bitcoin comrpessed WIF key, BIP38 encrypted it, converted the 6P base58 key back into hex, and took the last 36 bytes (address hash + encrypted key, i.e. everything except the 0142 prefix and the flagbyte), replaced the private key in the xprv key with those 36 bytes, and then changed the prefix so the new longer key would begin with "xp38" instead of xprv.  it's in my "new_main_functions" module on [my github]( which i am continuously working on at the moment, and it's in the Bip32Key class.

my new_main_functions requires pycrypto, scrypt, ecdsa, and pyBIP0038, all of which can be installed by pip.  if scrypt has trouble installing, you can get a pure python scrypt implementation [here]( although it's much slower.
pycrypto and scrypt are only ever used for bip38 encryption/decryption, and ecdsa is actually ONLY used for RFC6979 k-generation in my signing/verifying functions.  (i could have re-wrote it myself, but i got lazy.)
i wrote the module in order to learn to do everything myself.  that's why i don't use any other modules for anything.  i needed to learn how shit worked, and the way to do that for me is to re-write it myself (and occasionally copy/paste code and read it), so i can understand line by line what's going on.
pyBIP0038 is also my own module, and uses only pycrypto and scrypt.
so be careful-- it is mostly all my own code, but ive tested a fair chunk of it and it seems to work.

An address which it is highly unlikely anybody has the private key for.
And of course, that's just a guess.  It's possible I have the private key for 1ThisisTotaLLyAVaLidAddressy7mcZQ but it's pretty unlikely, since even vanity-mining 7 or 8 letters takes a lot of work, so doing a whole address is near impossible.  Let alone now a context-specific address like 17trXMk6Zispostingtosomattxww41ai, and now you gotta figure it's impossible.

No.  That's why users and miners choose what software they run.  For soft forks that don't invalidate current protocols, if the majority don't update, then the new protocol simply doesn't ever get adopted.  For hard forks, if the majority doesn't update, then the hard fork is essentially an alt-coin with a smaller base of miners.
Bitcoin was designed with decentralization in mind, and it truly can *and should* function that way, in every respect.  If you want to cede your trust to a human, you are welcome to.  I prefer not to.

We need more info.  What is the wallet/site you are using?  What address did you mean to send to?
You're not getting helpful answers because we are all confused about what exactly happened.  Bitcoin addresses include what's called a checksum, which means that if you type the address wrong, your client should tell you.  Changing even one letter from a lower to a capital makes the address invalid.  And no client I'm aware of will let you send money to an invalid address.
So, details man, details!
1DP1JNJA1WHa3s2KE7T2CKeAn67syvM3i, which I grabbed from your screen shot, is not a valid bitcoin address.  When I correct the checksum to match the first part, and get 1DP1JNJA1WHa3s2KE7T2CKeAn67rx4GL6, that address has no money in it.
You need to get the transaciton ID from your wallet site.

network propogation tracking is not new and it doesn't make zero confirmation tx's safer.  it DOES tell you if the tx is just outright invalid since that wouldn't be propogated, but that's about it.
dont get me wrong, this is still certainly useful and im glad it's being implemented, but i dont like the idea of implying it makes zero conf tx's safer.  zero conf tx's **are not in the blockchain**.  they are not part of the official ledger and should not be relied upon or used as new inputs.

Good.  That's what freedom is all about... choice.  Most Bitcoiners are going to be tech-savvy, and since Bitcoin gives them the choice of higher security, they want to use it.  But if you don't know enough to take advantage of that, you are free to use third party services.  I'm glad you found one you like and trust.  I'm more paranoid and tech-savvy, so I don't trust third party services, but I'm glad you are able to use Bitcoin in a manner that suits your personal needs.

Yeah I think I'm just gonna let the thief and the guy he stole from sort it out.  I performed a legitimate transaction and don't feel any obligation to sacrifice myself.  I wasn't involved, it's not my problem.  The thief stole from the other guy, why on earth should I refund the other guy in effect making myself now the victim when I wasn't involved to begin with.  Let the actual victim sue the thief.  Now obviously if I can get back what I gave to the thief in the transaction and effectively undo the transaction, I'm more than happy to do that and return what the thief paid me, back to the original victim, but ain't no way in hell I'm going to take the hit for a crime I wasn't involved with.
Now you can talk about what the law is all you want, but this is one reason why I deal only in cash and bitcoins.  Life is a lot easier when you're self-employed and deal in a cash-only business.  I feel no moral obligation to sacrifice myself and involve myself in another person's conflict when it doesn't provide any gain for anybody involved.  All it does is shift the less from the original victim over to me, there's no net benefit, so unless you can think of a good reason to do so, there's zero chance I'm going to take the hit for a crime I had no involvement in.  Like I said, if I can get back what I gave to the thief in the legitimate transaction between the thief and me, and I don't end up *losing* anything, I'm happy to make things right, but I'm not going to just volunteer take the whole burden from the victim.  That's insanity.

or they start mining their own side chain and not publishing it, deposit on a exchange, convert to litecoins, cashout litecoins, then after a few litecoin confirmations, publish to the network their new longer chain they've been side-mining which doesn't include the original tx where they sent their btc to the exchange.  bam they've just doubled their money and robbed the exchange.  you could pull something like that off in less than 5 confirmations i bet.

It only "lowers your overall risk" if this bet you are making currently is itself lower risk than your average risk up to that point.

@_date: 2014-10-21 19:41:08
It's already mostly taken care of.  The Core client for example throws a warning at the very least, and maybe even blocks, new chains which make an orphan out of 12 or more confirmed blocks.  Additionally, the community at large can just block the malicious longer chain, and "fork" bitcoin where the first malicious block is just hard-coded to be invalid, and so all its remaining blocks are invalid too.  Everybody would see when the longest chain got published, so the community would react pretty quickly.  I'm honestly not all that worried about it.  I imagine it would be like the March 2013 fork, except at a much larger and more exciting scale.

I don't see why you couldn't make a science out of it though by keeping your predictions to yourself and provably timestamping them, then recording the outcome, then publishing after everything is complete.  Surely the chaos theory interactions for re-testing can be diluted enough for a low error rate and still give meaningful results.

Bad examples.  Both Mega and Blockchain have put out browser extensions specifically to check for things like that.
Of course you have to trust the extensions.  But better to have to check one thing once, than to have to check the site each time.  And of course, they might not catch everything.
The point is more risks can be mitigated than you are giving credit for.  And yes, the fact is that if you aren't a programmer, or rather if you don't make the hardware yourself and write the OS and compiler yourself, at some point you have to trust somebody.  And while nothing is fool proof, mitigating some risks is better than not.

the private key itself isn't the problem.  the private key can be perfectly random and very secure.  but if this K value is re-used in different signatures that are created by that same private key (that is, if you send one tx from that address, and then send another tx from that address, and the signatures in both tx's use that same K value), then you can derive the private key used to make the signatures.

Bitcoin doesn't need investors, it needs *adopters* -- people who use the technology for its benefits.  Not because they hope to get rich from it.  THAT's what will make long term growth and stabilization.  Bitcoin isn't a ponzi scheme, it doesn't need new investors.  It works perfectly well as a closed economy with no new fiat.  And within that closed economy, life is much better and easier and shit just works.  We want to grow that economy to encompass more people *for their benefit*, not for the price.

so each "parent" key can have two kinds of "child" keys.  a normal key and a "hardened" key.  in a chain of normal child keys, knowledge of the master parent public key as well as *any* child private key can reveal the master parent private key (and all normal child private keys then too obv).  however, in a "hardened" child chain, the private key leak is stopped at the hardened child, so the master parent isn't compromised, just the normal children below that hardened child.
so for example, we'll have a chain of "m/2/4/6/8/10" and let's call "m" the master parent key.  if the private key for 8 is known and the master parent public key is known, then all the keys are compromised, because you can derive all the way up to the parent key.  but if the chain had been "m/2/4/6h/8/10, and 8 got compromised, there wouldn't be a problem, because 6h is a "hardened" six, so the master key is safe.
the reason they don't just have ALL child keys be "hardened" by default is that you can't derive hardened addresses from parent public keys, only from parent private keys.  so if im a corporation and i want to give each section head a child key to use as a "master" key, i want to be able to watch all of those child addresses, and have other people watch them as well, without giving away the private key.  so i give them the parent master key, from which they can derive the child keys.  but if the child keys were "hard", then they couldn't derive those "hardened" child keys with just the master public key, so they couldn't watch the address.
so hardened keys stop the private key leak issue, but they also prevent watch lists of public keys.  i personally like the security and don't care about public key watch lists, so my chains always start with hardened keys.
the way in which keys are hardened or not hardened has to do with how the child keys are derived.  normal child keys are basically a hash of adding the parent key and the chain code, so you can verify that the child key belongs to the parent, and that the chain code is correct, and verify all the way up.  (that key adding process is why the private key can compromise all the private keys above it.)  however, hardened keys use a hash of the parent's *private* key, so you can only verify that the child is correct if you have the parent private key.  that's why a master parent public key cannot derive a hardened child key.

Why do you think your threshold for risk should apply to others?
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:01:40


incorrect.  but if you are worried, then simply wait for more confirmations.  single block orphans happen quite frequently, just as part of the protocol, without anybody messing anything up.  if you want to make sure your transaction is valid, wait a few days for a few hundred confirmations.  there is effectively zero chance such a transaction will ever be reversed and you can then confidently assume that it's valid.
the bitcoin protocol doesn't work on absolutes.  it doesn't solve the byzentine general's problem with 100% effectiveness.  it works on ever decreasing probabilities.  as each block is added on top of the block that has your transaction, it becomes exponentially harder and harder to mine a side-chain double spending or un-doing that transaction.  for almost anything, a couple of confirmations is going to be good enough.  for really expensive items, maybe you wait somewhere around 6-30 blocks depending on your paranoia level.  but you can never be 100% certain.
but as far as protocol change go, no, a small number of people do not have control.  they might SEEM to, because a large number of people may simply *take their word*, but their control is completely voluntary and can be rejected.  you can bet if a flaw is found in gavin's code that appears to be malicious, his credibility will FOREVER be reduced, and fewer people will choose to use his code.  bitcoin is completely democratic.  the users decide on all  changes.  many of them mindlessly go along with what a few want, because they trust them, but that's because that trust has been *earned*, not *forced*, and that trust can also evaporate at the slightest deceit.
saying that a few people control bitcoin is disingenuous to how bitcoin works, and also to the *reason* that so many people follow those few.  those few have *earned* the trust they get, and it will evaporate if they abuse it.

that's a logical error.  what happened in the past (you lost money) has no bearing on whether or not buying/selling is the right decision currently.

Yeah that means they've already switched SSL providers.  Their GoDaddy cert was revoked and they got a new one issued by Thawte.
Those are both "root certificate authorities".  Which means that your browser trusts them to say whether or not a certificate is the real one for that site and not a fake one by a MITM attacker.  The little green lock means that a root authority has confirmed that the certificate being used is the correct one.  A non-green lock means that it's self-signed, which means that the page is encrypted, but the browser can't ask any authority "hey is this the real certificate or a fake one?"  But you could still potentially trust a certificate like that, if for example you know who runs the site and he PGP signs a message with the certificate fingerprint or something like that.

We're pretty much in agreement.  My argument is encryption is by far the best.  But ya any form of security is vulnerable because somebody (you) has to access the data at some point, and if you are being surveilled/keylogged/whatever, then your method will fail because the other party can watch you access it.  But digital security is easier to setup, easier to do more securely, easier to detect and prevent surveillance and intrusions, and in pretty much every other way.  The only reason people *think* it's less secure is because physical security only ever has a *targeted* attacker, whereas digital security gets "mass-hacked" a lot.  But in the event you have a modicum of understanding of good security practices, and in the event where you are being specifically targeted both physically and digitally, digital security is by a wide margin the best option.  In fact, I would argue that it's by far the best option under pretty much every circumstance.  If you find that you feel physical security is the safer option, I argue that that's solely because of a lack of competence in digital security.

im not talking about me personally, im making an argument.  what about people who cannot find work, have work but don't make enough to finance moving to another fucking country for fuck's sake, or have loved ones and other ties to their physical location that have nothing to do with politics or finances.
it's like you are coming into a forest and telling the forest natives that they can follow your rules or leave.  the fact that you built walls around them and forcibly jailed them and they had kids in the meantime-- none of that actually changes the nature or ethics of the original situation.  you simply do not have any god given right to tell other people what to do.  nobody has that right.  voluntary interaction is the only moral societal code.  and don't get me wrong-- there can be volunteerism communities with rule of law-- but the current state, and certainly the (lack of) argument you are making does not fall within that definition.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:49:21


of course i will, and i fully expect to.  i didnt say my system was magical and cost-free, i said it wasn't the current system and that it was voluntary.


maybe for you. i live as a free individual, as i see fit.  your "laws" are only risk-reward analysis to my mind


pretty sure the community would voluntarily decide to enact defensive measures.  i suppose if you would just sit on your thumbs while being attacked, then maybe forced rules are right for you.  for those of us who aren't children, voluntarism is better.  im sure you would be able to find people who would happily tell you what to do though, even in a voluntary society.


algorithms are the *foundation* on which the laws are written.  like ethereum, for example.  but the actual "bitlaw" can be voted on very frequently, each week or even daily or more frequently, to iron out kinks, since the system is *perfectly efficient* and voting and changing the law is only a matter of sending a coin.  you are trying to use old world models to wrap your head around the idea-- you need to completely scratch that and work from the ground up.  you need to discard your notions of hierarchical bureaucratic systems.


you are correct.  if i choose to not pay taxes and then live extravagantly, the IRS will audit me and police with guns will put me in jail.  but whether i pay taxes or not, and whether i follow laws or not, are not based on the fact that they are laws.  what i do is based on what i believe is right, and the law only comes into play as a risk-reward analysis in my mind.
but i do like how you say people aren't going to put up with me not following their fabricated rules.  it very acutely shows exactly my point-- some group of people arbitrarily deciding how other people should live and using force if they are ignored.
but, thankfully, technology-- bitcoin, encryption, etc-- enable me to care even less what you think, and to lower the coefficient of threat you all pose in my risk-reward analysis.


as i keep saying, i neither require nor seek your approval for my actions.  my life is my own.  you are free to think whatever you want about me and my views.  you keep laughing at me and voting; i'll be.... doing whatever i want.

This "don't trust US companies" is complete bunk, born of a misunderstanding related to the Snowden revelations.  The NSA at least theoretically needs a court approval to get data from US companies, but it suffers no such restrictions to grab data from foreign companies.  Additionally, the US has no data retention laws, while the EU for example does.  Not being a US company does not at all make a company safer or more trustworthy.  The amount of data the NSA gets via US-based NSL's versus its technological gathering capabilities and its partnerships with the Five Eyes to get data on companies that it can't get NSL's for makes the distinction basically non-existent.
This idea that non-US companies are safer is completely wrong.  The only trustworthy software is, as you say, open source.

I'm buying them because I'm trying to get everybody else to, as you say, view one bitcoin being worth one bitcoin, and fuck the fiat trade rates.

Actually, IIRC, tx ID's are generated before signatures are added to the tx.  If that's the case, OP could make a 2-of-2 address, then create a tx to fund it, but not sign that tx, and use instruct 2, 3, and/or 4 to use the tx ID to make and sign an nLockTime tx to send the funds back.  Once he is in possession of the signed nLockTime tx to return the money, he signs the original funding tx and broadcasts it.
The only problem there is transaction malleability, although that could be solved with a funding tx that only has one input and one output

This is the crux of our disagreement.  The factors that lead to a differing cost basis may lead to different investment strategies being appropriate (since one's situation will have changed), but the cost basis itself does not and should not be the *basis* for that determination.
In the text I just quoted, you say "Yes, it makes sense for the person who is up to sell and lock in profits and not so for the person who is not up and just got in" -- you say that in full recognition of the conditions I laid out, where the two people and their investments were completely identical in every manner.
Quite frankly I am floored that you don't see the error in logic there, when it is so clearly laid out.  Two identical people.  Two identical life situations.  Two identical amounts of money.  Two identical investments.  Yet you are claiming that (all else being equal) it is *still* correct for the two people to have differing investment strategies, based on past results -- results which have no predictive value for the future.

correct.  also remember that any time you send coins in the bitcoin-qt client, and most other clients, they automatically empty the address and send the change to a new address.  so you want to consider backing your wallet up regularly.
does anybody here know if you can specify a wallet file that's not in the datadir?  i know you can do that with electrum, but i don't know about bitcoin-qt.  that would be awesome because they i could just move the actual file itself to my dropbox encfs-encrypted folder, instead of doing that just with the backup.  that would be a nice easy way to ensure that it's just automatically backed up.

ya, you just need to know how to get the hex of an unsigned tx.  ive been fiddling with making custom OP_RETURN tx's so ive learned how to spit out simple unsigned tx's via the "createrawtransaction" command.  for nlock_time, you'd just need to take your raw tx, change the sequence number to 0 (or possible just any number lower than the max, im not sure), and the change the lock time to whatever you want.  if it's less than 500 million, it will assume the number is a block height, if it's more than that, it will assume it's a unix epoch (in seconds) time.  then you just need to sign the tx using the "signrawtransaction" command and broadcast it to the network using "sendrawtransaction".  right now, the current version of bitcoin-qt won't broadcast it, and will drop it, unless nlocktime has passed, so what you need to do is just sign it and then keep it, or mail it to some friends, and wait to broadcast it.  nobody can do anything with it, so it doesn't hurt to give it out.

The Ethereum guys go into a lot of detail as to why they chose that way of doing things.  You might not agree with it, but it was very well thought out.  The long and the short of it is, they wanted people who knew enough about the thing to start developing on it right away, so they wanted to give them coins to do that.
Regardless, and like I said in another post in this thread, it doesn't even really matter that some fraction is pre-mined.  It's like namecoin in that sense.  Would it matter if namecoin was pre-mined?  No, because the value is in what the protocol does, and you just need a small number of coins in order to execute the protocol.  Pre-mine matters if the purpose of the coins is money.  Namecoins and ethereum coins have value in their protocol, and the pre-mining in ethereum is specifically done to give to programmers to get cracking and testing things on the protocol as soon as possible.  That seems to be a pretty good trade-off as far as I can see.
And what the hell does the ethereum company have to do with anything at all?  Open source is open source.  What history lesson is it we've learned?  Gavin is part of the "centralized" Foundation, and he writes Bitcoin code just fine.
FULL DISCLOSURE:  I own no ethereum coins and have not invested in ethereum in any fashion.  I just see the value of it.

as you can see, it currently right now takes more than the top three pools cooperating to do a 51% attack.  (unknown isn't a pool, it just unidentified IPs of block solvers.)
that chart will only get even more distributed over time.
there is no mining centralization problem, and people who think mining is getting *more* centralized over time are just starkly blind to reality.

I chose Python because it seemed to be best suited to my purposes.  It's a more intuitive and "simple" language, and just kind of works the way you'd think a programming language ought to work, but it's still very powerful.  It's also what a lot of Bitcoin projects are using, and it's compatible with almost everything.  I view it as kind of a jack-of-all-trades language that's not quite the best at any one thing, but is "good enough" at everything I might want to do, whether it's simple scripting, or desktop applications, or web programming.

oh man i honestly don't know how to explain this in a short simple way.  i'll give it a try though...
you can only spend money from an address if you have its private key.  addresses (aka what you call "accounts") are derived from private keys, however it's also possible to just make an address out of thin air that you don't have the private key to, and thus can't spend from.  just cause an address is known doesn't at all mean that the private key is known.
additionally, the process of deriving an address from the private key effectively makes the address random.  therefore, when you see an address where the entire thing is clearly readable, it's **highly** likely that there is no known private key associated with it -- that it was an address made up from thin air without a corresponding private key.
so my post was saying that sure you could spend from it if you knew how to get the private key from the public address (which is near-impossible and would completely break bitcoin).
it was a joke.

@_date: 2014-11-24 01:29:38
but again, there's a number of factors to consider there.  the first is the proportionality of the criminal response to the victim's behavior.  the crime is pretty much always disproportionately large compared with the behavior the victim is engaging in.  the second is that you leave no leeway for the frequency of behavior.  people make mistakes.  it's not right to say somebody shouldn't have done something that makes it more likely they are a victim of crime if indeed they rarely do that behavior and just happened to once accidentally.  how do you frame that?  is it now their fault?  do we expect people to never make mistakes?
and the third of course is my original argument a few posts ago where i used the virus/disease example.  it simply isn't right to be framing it at all as the fault of the victim.  while certain behaviors are better/worse in terms of the probabilities of being victimized, the fault is still entirely the crime to begin with.
this leads to my fourth point.  at some point, problems do actually go from self responsibility to societal woes.  for example, alcohol is legal and socially accepted because a minority of people have problems with abusing it or other issues related to it.  but if 99% of people who drank had those problems that the minority currently has, it would likely be illegal and classified like other hard drugs.  the degree of effect of the problems, and the number of people who suffer those ills when drinking matter in how much personal responsibility we assign to its usage.  that's why we call addicts "addicts".  because addition chemically removes the ability to be rational and make rational choices.
but back to point three, and trying to hammer that home:  it really is right to view crime like a virus.  even if you present people with a safe behaviors brochure, the problem is still *entirely* the crime itself.

The problem with all the Windows hate is that it doesn't actually address the problem.  The problem is the majority of users don't know and don't practice good security.  Using Linux isn't going to change that, because the user is going to gravitate towards more convenient things, which are likely to be less secure.
I use two of the most insecure things a person can possibly use with bitcoin: a pirated version of Windows, and a brain wallet.  I've had bitcoins in both for well over two years.  But I have not yet lost bitcoins.  However stupid you think I am, at least hear out the argument.
Sure the NSA might have backdoors into Windows.  They might also have compromised the chips.  The hacked version of Windows may have its own viruses in it somewhere.  I can't know for sure, but I can make educated guesses based on the available information and the incentives such people may have, and come up with conclusions about assumptions to determine what is likely to be reasonable versus unreasonable.  I know my Windows system inside and out-- I understand what Microsoft was going for, how the architechture was put together.  I have a bevvy of anti-virus software and software firewalls, and auto-sandboxing of non-whitelisted applications.  I know what all my services are and all the processes are and do, and I've checked the hashes of my system files against non-hacked versions.
As for my brain wallet, it is made knowing full well how insecure brain wallets are and assuming that trillions of tries per second are being done and the instant any of them have money in them ever again they are gone.  The brain wallet isn't just the first round hash of a memorable phrase.
The point is that security is a mindset, a practice.  I'm doing two very insecure things, yet I am pretty confident about my security, because I understand WHY and HOW those things are considered insecure, and I employ methods to combat those insecurities given that I still intend to do the insecure things.  I like Windows.  It's the most used OS, and Windows 7 works pretty well.  Yeah, it's hacked, yeah it's not open source, yeah any number of vulnerabilities could exist that I can't know about because of those things-- but at some point there has to be boundaries of reason on paranoia.
I consider my 8192 bit PGP key generated on this machine to be secure.  Might I be wrong?  Yeah, possibly.  But the NSA, nor bitcoin hackers and theives, are not omnicient omnipresent enemies.
No machine is secure if the user doesn't understand or practice good security.  Windows isn't magically insecure for bitcoin just because it's closed source.  That's part of the reason, but it's also less secure because the users are less security-conscious.  It's also less secure because malware makers primarily write viruses just for Windows because they know that's what most people use.  It's also less secure because security software is difficiult for the lay-user to understand and implement.  None of that has to do with Windows itself-- it's a culture of how people approach security.  Thinking it's just a Windows problem misses that point entirely.  And in fact it's downright dangerous to give the impression that you're magically safe if you just stop using Windows.
Security is a mindset, not an OS.

produces the raw hex transaction:
    010000000181601c93c5557d8c958644d3a837618225ab13eb7719e44004e5738b766fd4700000000000ffffffff01c3553b8cb90300001976a9146bc956e9a38dc39e831a37ba937085ea02b7358688ac00000000

If that's your threat model, you should consider all tech companies *period* to be compromised. That's really my point. The US isn't "worse" than others-- the NSA isn't nearly as restricted by the law as you think it is, and in fact, they have *more* restrictions against spying on US based companies than they do against foreign companies. They have to "follow" the law when they do things here in the US, but they have free reign on foreign countries as far as the "law" is concerned.  So being a US company might even be better, but it's certainly not worse.
Also, it's worth noting that he NSA isn't some magical omnipotent entity.  Encryption works.  You can buy the hardware yourself, making sure it's made from smaller brand computer chips.  Sure those could be compromised from the start, but there's got to be bounds of reason on paranoia at come point.  PIA has also said they don't log anything period and they've never been forced to give user information away.  [This]( was their response to a subpena somewhat recently, and while they may be gagged from talking openly about an NSL, the NSL doesn't carry that much additional legal weight as far as compliance.
Could they just be outright lying?  Sure, but like I said before, there's got to be bounds of reason on paranoia at some point.  Every tech company who says similar things is either lying or compromised unbeknownst to them.  Given that that would be a huge revelation, and such a revelation hasn't been exposed as happening via the Snowden documents, it's relatively safe to say that the scale of surveillance is quite that omnipresent just yet.
That all being said, I don't think it's *crazy* per se to have the attitude you have, but I still stand by my original statement that PIA as as safe *as it's possible for a VPN to be*, and if you need more security, you just surf with Tor.  (And being a US company does not make them any worse in terms of security.)

Buying and selling bitcoin for one of the largest markets was *exactly* what the business model of "making bitcoin easier to get in and out of" should be doing.
You're still stuck in the idea that Silk Road was "bad" and therefore any interaction with it is "bad" and therefore Charlie was being "bad".
But that's simply not true.  The Silk Road took gang/cartel violence off the street and replaced it with anonymous seller rating systems that made the use of violence completely useless.  It took away the uncertainty of the quality of product you were going to get and replaced that with a rating.  It made doing drugs safer, for users and for sellers.  It made the world safer and better.  The only argument against it is if you think people shouldn't be allowed to do what they want with their bodies.  And to be honest, I can understand that viewpoint.  Addiction takes away the ability to choose -- one is not one's self when one is an addict -- so I can see the argument for saying that some 3rd party needs to make that choice for another.
But moving money around is not related to that.  Buying and selling bitcoins doesn't make it easier or harder to do drugs or to stop drugs.  That's just a lie you've been fed.


First of all, of course he did.  You can't "launder" very much money in hiding.  Second of all, he repeatedly made sure he was acting correctly and by the books.  The only "evidence" against him is explaining to somebody what procedures he had to follow.  He *always followed them*.  The charge against him is that he was helping launder money by helping the guy avoid regulations because he merely told the guy what procedures he was following.
Thirdly, "money laundering" is a crime of concealing money *from a crime*.  The guy Charlie sold to just sold bitcoins and cash on Silk Road, he didn't sell any drugs.  He was basically a middleman for Charlie's business model, but with a higher cut, and he made the difference.  So Charlie is accused of helping a guy buy bitcoins, who might then sell those bitcoins to somebody else who may or may not buy drugs with them.
Are you still saying you think Charlie was *at all* in the wrong here?


You go ahead and keep thinking that.  Yeah, code is non-political.  Bitcoin doesn't have a viewpoint.  Dark Wallet doesn't have a viewpoint.  Tor doesn't have a viewpoint.  It's all just non-political code.
Of fucking course Bitcoin has a viewpoint.  The viewpoint is the code itself.


Then you can monitor businesses you invest with closely.  But when your thoughts on the Silk Road impact others' ability to buy and sell bitcoin, you've tread on fungibility.  And you had better at least realize that's true.

Again, that's classic victim blaming.  You're blaming the kid who appeases the bully or the girl who "dresses slutty".  Sure they could act differently to illicit different responses and be less likely to be attacked by an attacker, but the whole point is that they shouldn't need to change their behavior, because the attacker is entirely at fault.  Arguing a girl should not dress slutty may be practical advice for an individual, but it's still the wrong approach generally, and society would benefit more as a whole by vilifying attackers rather than promoting unprovocative behavior in potential victims.

It causes less of a temporary clusterfuck if you wait to do that until there's already broad consensus.
IIRC, when they implemented P2SH, they "implemented" it so that P2SH transactions would only be valid if 95% of the previous blocks had a coinbase transaction with "/P2SH/" in the script sig to signify that they were willing to accept P2SH transactions as valid.
That was a good way to do it.  If the vast majority of people miners didn't hop on board, it simply wouldn't be implemented.  It made P2SH implementation extremely easy and straightforward.

ok i just read their site, which ive never actually used, and they aren't using the bitcoin blockchain, they're using a combination of numbers you choose and they choose, and then hashing them together.  go [here]( and click the "Fair?" tab to see what they're doing, and you can verify outcomes [here](  now because they don't use the bitcoin blockchain hashes, you could claim they are creating your own client seeds non-randomly, but although i haven't personally looked, im sure they are used standard ways to create it, and that it is possibly to verify the method.  i dont know and dont care, but if you do, you should ask people more knowledgable than i am about how those are generated.  even so, everything is still hashed with sha512, so they'd still just have to be compiling a table or something.  but ya, the randomness, assuming you go check everything else out, which i havent done because i dont care to use the site, is based on sha512.  i dont know the method they use to determine a winner or loser, but it's pretty trivial to just say just whatever the least significant byte is, in terms of a percent of 256, is what the outcome is, and you can do that with two or three bytes and get any arbitrarily long number of significant digits to satisfy whatever you need for your game

it's a good way to link addresses.  next time you spend money, it's likely going to be more than that, so the tx input will include that address as well as another address you own, so you can now link those two addresses as belonging to the same person.  additionally, if the inputs are say that 0.000001 and 4.35, and the output is 0.2 to one address, and 4.150001 to another address, it's pretty likely that the 4.150001 address was the change address, so now somebody knows three addresses that are owned by you, and all by just sending a fraction of a penny to one address they know you own.  cheap way for feds to start building a good identity graph.

Yeah, Bitcoin is cutting edge technology and still relatively new, so there's not very much newbie-friendly documentation -- just techies talking to other techies.  So as before, my recommendation is to use third party services unless and until you are comfortable using it yourself.
As for change addresses -- well that's just part of how Bitcoin works.  Bitcoin is just a ledger that follows transactions from A to B to C.  So if somebody sends 1 bitcoin to address A, and then another person sends 0.5 to address A also, your wallet will tell you you have 1.5 bitcoins, but what you really have is two ledger entries, for 1.0 and 0.5.  And any time you spend/update a ledger entry, you have to move the entire value of it.  So if you wanted to spend 0.8 bitcoins, you'd take that 1 bitcoin ledger entry and use it as the source of funding for your new transaction.  But part of how Bitcoin works is you have to use ALL funds from a ledger entry, so in order to make that transaction, you'd make a new ledger update where you take that 1 bitcoin and send 0.8 to somebody else and 0.2 to another address you own, leaving you with a new ledger entry of 0.2 (in addition to your unspent 0.5 from earlier, for a total of 0.7).
So change addresses are necessary because Bitcoin works by moving money via updates on a ledger, so every update has to account for all the money on an entry on that ledger.  If you had 0.5 and spend 0.3, the ledger needs to know what to do with the other 0.2.  The new ledger entry has to add up to the total of the old entry.  You can send change back to yourself, you can pay somebody else, or if you leave it blank, then miners can claim it and you've just paid a hefty mining fee.  But one way or another, the total value WILL be accounted for.  That's just how Bitcoin works.

So free market ideals include "money laundering" (aka financial privacy) being a crime?  Free market ideals and decentralization don't include financial privacy?
His business was making buying and selling bitcoin in and out of fiat as easy for people as possible, so that bitcoin could become adopted as easily as possible.  BitInstant was the precursor to Bitpay and Coinbase.
Sorry but your "caution" makes no sense.  If you think money laundering is a real thing, you've already failed the litmus test of support the ideals behind Bitcoin.  Financial privacy is a NECESSITY for a currency.  Without it, one unit is distinguishable from another unit.  And when one unit is not equal to every other unit, fungibility is not possible, which means the sole role money is gone.

dude it's exactly as useful as it sounds.  it means you no longer have to sit on a time-locked tx, it goes in the blockchain right away, and the burden of waiting for expiration is on the spending tx, not waiting for the input tx itself.  now instead of passing through side-channels a signed tx that wont fucking get relayed, it goes in the blockchain, but the time encumbrance is still there in the scriptpubkey or redeemscript.

@_date: 2014-11-27 07:36:53
No, it didn't affect anything because bitcoin is based on consensus, and nobody agreed that those coins were valid, so the client was patched, a soft fork happened, the majority of the network mined on a chain that didn't include those coins, and they were pruned from existence.
Somebody also in 2010 discovered a different bug that allowed anybody to spend anybody else's coins, but again, the consensus was that those tx's weren't valid, so the majority of the network used the new soft fork patch, mined on a chain that didn't include those transactions, and again, everything was fixed.
The same will be true of any way that bitcoin gets hacked.  Because Bitcoin is built on consensus that certain transactions are valid.  If you make a transaction that the people don't consider valid, they won't mine on a chain that includes it.  And if those people are greater than 51% of the network, then the longest chain will be theirs, and your transaction will never be confirmed, and prior confirmations from a now-orphaned chain will be un-done.
THAT's why it won't affect anything.

That being said, I still take issue with it being a default.  UK citizens can turn off their porn filters, but the fact that they have to request to get the whole internet is still a problem to begin with and is still censorship.  Similarly, most users use default settings for things, and it is still a form of censorship to change those settings to block things.
Luke's argument is that he's only blocking spam and he's protecting full nodes and miners by doing this, and a not insignificant portion of them agree.  This is a systemic problem in the Bitcoin community that a large portion of people who contribute to maintaining the network (full nodes and miners) feel they have a right to decide what they store on their computers and how much space they use.  I *understand* that argument but I very much disagree with it.  The entire purpose of Bitcoin is to be an uncensorable ledger that frees the world to transact in any way they see fit.  And just becuase you don't like dust or gambling or mastercoin doesn't mean it's right for you to try to block them.
But a lot of full nodes and miners disagree and think it is their right to do that.  It really is a war for Bitcoin's soul.

logic and math have only fundamental mathematical axioms.  if they aren't based on that, they don't qualify as logic and math.
your view that if mining isn't profitable for the little guy, fewer little guys will do it.  that is correct, but the conclusion that therefore big player mining harms the network does not follow from that.  and if you think it through, and go through the economic incentives, you will arrive at the correct conclusion, which is that big players actually do help the network, and that small players controlling majority hashing power actually leaves the network MORE vulnerable because such a low hashrate allows for any big player to come disrupt the network; whereas a half dozen big players acting in their own self interest will necessarily police each other.  additionally, their mining equipment and drive for profit means better asic technology filters down into the whole economy much faster, since they have to sell it when it's no longer profitable to use.  this has the aggregate network effect of approximately what's already happening, where the "little men" who mine for ideal rather than profit, comprise a large minority of the hash rate, and the majority is still split relatively evening amongst big players, and because cooperation gains nothing extra that competetion doesn't provide, and defecting from cooperating pays, there is almost no chance that big players will cooperate to undermine the network, and even if for some reason they did, the idealists control enough of a network that bitcoin would immediately fork and their cooperation would be useless anyway.
you only get that equilibrium when you have big players and big hashing power.  if the network were smaller and only small miners, it would always be subject to the whims of the rich and powerful.  but when you have the rich and powerful profiting a little bit, you protect it because you pit each big player against each other, economically speaking.  there is no incentive for cooperation, and now the network is so difficult that it can't be controlled.  so in the end the network is far safer even though outwardly at first glance it might seems less so because it's not as evenly distributed as you might like.

there has been no hack on the bitcoin protocol.  the issue with blockchain was that they accidentally temporarily had a really bad random number generator.  part of the way you sign a bitcoin transaction and prove you own the funds involves doing some work on a random number, and there's a neat trick in math where you can prove you did that work without revealing the number.  (and that work involves mixing the random number with your private key, so you also prove you own your private key).  however, if that random number is revealed or if you use the same number twice (and thus the output of the work you did with it is the same), your private key can be revealed.
the R value is a number that is the result of the work on that secret random number, which is called the K value.  blockchain accidentally picked non-random K values for a short time, and people caught onto it by looking at the R values, which are public.
that was a programming mistake on their part which caused the public signatures made when you made transactions on their website, to basically give away the private keys (since those signatures, and the R value contained in the signature, are public).  additionally, that same bad programming was used to create new "random" private keys for new accounts for a short while, and somebody guessed that that might have happened and started looking for guessable private keys based on that bad programming... and found some.
that is not a problem with the bitcoin core protocol.  the bitcoin core protocol specifies that that K value must be random and not re-used, and the vast majority of clients, including electrum, do it properly.  there's even a new standard called RFC-6979 that lays out a specific way to generate those random k values which can never be messed up, so if you use that standardized way of generating them, you will always have safe K and R values.
as far as i know, electrum works properly and you are safe -- although you are right to be concerned.  any fuck up by them, or more likely by you, can compromise your bitcoins.  bitcoin isn't ready for mass adoption yet because of that -- the general public has never before needed to actually have good security.  you've always had your money held by a bank, and your e-mails held by google, and if your account gets hacked you could also scan your ID and they'd give access to it back to you.  but bitcoin is different -- with bitcoin, you are in complete control and if you dont secure them, you have no one else to turn to if things go wrong.  there is no recourse if you fuck up.
if you don't know anything about computers or computer security, you run an extremely high risk of one day losing your bitcoins, and i would recommend to you to use third party wallet services, like coinkite or coinbase or circle, and make sure you only ever access them on your home computer, not any public computers.
if you care about your self reliance, i'd certainly recommend taking the time to learn enough about bitocin and security to be comfortable using it, and i'd also recommend learning about PGP and Tor and other encryption tools.  these are things that can help you guarantee your rights.  but it may not be worth the effort to you.  plenty of people live very long and happy lives ceding control of themeselves to others.  that's not for me, but it's certainly easier and i understand the appeal.  and i genuinely feel bad that the tools to enable freedom and self-reliance aren't safer and easier to use for non-techie people.  but sadly, that is the state of things.  you'll have to decide where your priorities lay and how much effort you want to put into the various measures that can help you.  i think learning to safely use bitcoin is worth the hassle.  you may disagree.

Well, I just messed around with some introductory Python tutorials.  I should have followed them closer, because what's ended up happening is I got good enough to dive in, but I missed a lot of important stuff as well.  Like I got to know the syntax and how to define functions/methods and didn't learn anything about classes/objects until later, and so most of my stuff right now is a collection of functions, and much of it would have been better suited to be objects.
So I did that, and meanwhile was researching EC functions and just trying to get a general idea of how those worked, and once I got that and knew enough to flesh out some basic functions, I basically dove right in and started writing functions, then just googling whenever I was stuck.  Even though that was the more fun and interesting route, like I said I still don't recommend it because I wasted a lot of time, re-wrote many things that were already available, had to route around doing things an easy way simply because I didn't know about the easy way, etc. etc.  So I definitely recommend taking and sticking to a full introductory course before jumping in.  I really wish I had done that, because my current knowledge is haphazard and all around the place, and I'm still often learning about simple "tricks" that would have made life much easier but are apparently common knowledge and would have been known to me if I had taken the time to properly learn rather than trying to dive in before knowing anything.
Here are some useful links that I either have used or wish I had used:

It's a fact that no web wallet can be trusted to a higher degree than brute forcing a randomly generated bitcoin key.  Any time you don't control your private keys, but you are still supposed to be able to get to your money, that means another human has a means of accessing your private keys.  It is fundamentally not possible for that to be a secure setup.  ~~The only "web wallet" setup that is secure is something like Blockchain.info has, where the user actually DOES hold his private keys, in the form of his password and login info, but he just doesn't know it.~~  Edit: Nevermind, I'm wrong about that.  They still hold the encrypted private keys, not you, which means they can lose your keys.


No, the best option is any means to secure a private key that you control.  Trezor is simply one option, but if you don't feel safe doing that, there's a bevy of other options.  They are, for the most part, "offline" options, since doing them on a computer that is always offline heavily mitigates other security leaks, and thus most mistakes aren't problematic, since your private keys can't be leaked onto the web no matter what.


No, I'm not emotional about bitcoin security, I'm emotional about people advocating bad security practices since doing so actively harms people.  You put people at risk when you recommend web wallets over offline solutions for security.  THAT's what gets me emotional.

the price of bitcoin is what you are willing to buy/sell/trade with them.  im certainly not using them for the mtgox "price".  mtgox has only affected the price inashmuch as they've scared a few people who don't use them.  that sucks, but that's how markets work.  i can profit off the fear of others too if i were so inclined.  any time people make emotional decisions with money, others can profit.
as for the bitcoins in the exchange, how many hacks and closures are going to have to happen before people realize they don't actually own bitcoins unless they and only they are the holders of the private key.

So is using Counterparty, what's your point?  Bitcoin simply isn't ready yet for mass adoption, *all* of its aspects are too complicated for most users currently.  But that's because it's new tech.  In 20 years, using Counterparty or Colored Coins will be very easy for the lay user, right now not so much.  My only claim in my original reply to you was that using Colored Coins right now is *easier* (not easy, esi*er*) than using Counterparty.  But of course neither is easy for 95% of users who can't code.  But those users shouldn't be using anything related to Bitcoin right now.

you just make a 501-of-1000 m-of-n multisig address where 500 of the required keys belong to you (or whoever the master key is).
however, currently bitcoin can only support up to 15 addresses, so the most you could do is 9 of 15 or 8 or 14 where you control half (rounded up) of the keys and the required number of keys is half-rounded-up plus 1.  so for 15 or 14 keys, you could give out 7 keys and you'd control the rest, and all of your keys plus one of the seven would be required.
theoretically, there's also the option to use complex scripting using OP_IF, where you have the master key plus 1 of n keys, but that's more complicated than I know how to do.

I assume you should just use the source code -- or do you mean something else by a command-line version?  To use the course code, download everything in the "main_functions" module into a folder called "main_functions" and make sure you have the required libraries, and then put the source code py file in the parent directory holding main_functions, and then just run it with python.

it is entirely optional for miners and does not affect their chances in the lottery process.
miners have complete discretion over what to include in their block -- including having no tx's -- and the chances of winning the lottery are exactly the same regardless of the transactions.
in the old days, a site called satoshi dice ran a gambling service based entirely on blockchain data-- the tx you sent was used as a seed for a random number and you were betting on the next block hash and then you'd get a tx back and so forth.  a lot of miners considered that spam and didn't want to encourage it, so they stopped including those tx's in their blocks even when there were fees attached.  (they could tell the tx's were from satoshi dice because the site used common addresses.)  some miners still mined them though, but that meant it would often take many hours to confirm any transactions, and thus playing on the site took much longer.  this annoyed customers, who stopped playing there and then arose a central server site called justdice.
a wonderful and natural market solution to a problem.

Exactly. Contract mechanisms are built with services *on top of* cash. And bitcoin is digital cash.

I'm not sure you understand what the word "truth" means.  Your theories about Snowden are what's called "speculation".  You have no facts or logic to back up what you say that aren't far more easily explained by other theories.  So your ideas are *speculation*.

This goes in line with my initial statements and beliefs, since in my experience, most economists that publicly make predictions have made them with certainty and without displaying proper caveats and error rates or explaining the narrow parameters in which the prediction is made.
The fact that in my experience economists have acted that way, in combination with your statements I quoted, is why I said I think economists are full of shit.

That's something that too many people don't seem to comprehend.  Data is not inherently racist.  
Now that being said, a LOT of hypothesis and conclusions we draw from data *do* contain our biases, often without our realizing it.  For example, it's a fact that black people score worse on intelligence tests; however the common conclusion drawn from that, that black people are less intelligent, is wrong.  Other studies clearly show that it's a cultural problem, and that the lifestyle that results in growing up in poor ghettos necessitates putting far less emphasis on book learning and more on "street smarts".  And the fact that proportionally so many live in poor ghettos is simply a result of them only having one or two generations since the civil rights movement -- progress is slow.
So it's actually doubly insulting when you realize a lot of "black" problems are directly because of the shitty situations they've been put in.  Add to that the exacerbated effects of lingering racism and having whites, due to the residual effects of recent history, be in higher positions of authority much more often (and the power trips that come with authority), it's very easy to understand the complaints of modern grievances.  It's also easy to understand, given ghetto culture, why objective data like crime rates and drug use are higher, without turning it into a racist "because they're black" thing.
Anyway I'm rambling.  Getting back on point-- no it's not racist to make a statistically valid recognition of the fact that black people are less likely to be sympathetic to the government's viewpoint.
As an aside, that's one thing I like about poker players -- the discussions are better and not as bogged down with political correctness.  I guess that's because poker rewards objectively understanding reality, whether reality is politically correct or not.  At the end of the day, if you delude yourself about the reasons behind things, you will lose out to those who are more honest with themselves.

That's not how the burden of proof works in this case.  We already know he was a government agent.  You are claiming things about his personal motivations and about his current employment -- both of which you cannot possibly know.  Further, his situation is far more easily explained by the events in public knowledge *and nothing else*.  In order to claim that there is *more to it than that*, you need evidence to support that claim.
That's Occam's Razor.  If a man goes and buys a hamburger and eats, sure he may be buying it to feed the alien parasite inside him that is holding him and his family hostage unless he feeds it... but the far more likely explanation is that he's just a man who was hungry for a hamburger, and in order for any more complex reasoning to be rational, like that wild hostage-alien theory, it needs to be supported by evidence.
Similarly, you need evidence to support more wild claims about Snowden than the simplest explanation which adequately explains everything.
Right now you are making claims about him (his motivation and his secret employers) that you cannot possibly know, and that's in addition to your claims being more far fetched than the prevailing theory that things are indeed what they seem to be.  For you to not be laughed out of the room, you need to provide evidence to back up your theories.  You don't just get to say "prove that he's not".  That's not how logic and the burden or proof works.
Do you understand why the burden of proof is on you to back up your claims?

Yes, bip39 is the standardization of a specific list of words for a given language, and the process of transforming those words into a 512 bit hex seed that is the seed for generating a bip32 hd wallet.
bip32 = hd wallets, what they are how they work
bip39 = specific type of mnemonic, and the process for turning it into a bip32 seed
bip44 = a specific format of a bip32 wallet
So any wallet that says it's "BIP 32/39/44 compatible" will give you 12-24 words as the "seed" and use those words to deterministically generate a 512 bit seed to deterministically create a bip32 master key, and then create and use child keys in the manner specified by bip44.
For example, my phone app might give me the words:
    cheese upset pudding inmate flavor crush hard same element index laugh supreme
which I then use the bip39 specification to derive the 512 bits:
    8b3137dc79f912e4c5cddbe4bbe313abd0a0a8cf2441dcf4d664655087e8c202431e8e7b2503e63426703b3c773a12473a94c39058e7fb0784ab570b80ed0a23
which I use as a bip32 seed to generate the master private key:
    xprv9s21ZrQH143K3Wjn9PzvdHooVbaSauXnawrxMhi7BdR1PrC41x51WTBWybzSjUaiPVH6BusrpupCkouMgAkBGtNJhb3bqpmRuKG5vrH96GL
which I can use to find the child key  m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 (a specific bip32 child key, as outlined in the bip44 specification), which gives me the first non-change address of 
    1LPdUu1qKXFTowobD9uB62QesdodtV2ugx
with the private key
    KziXBfNy2eZEKHdZeBZQ3ZyW3joXcv2k66yHuKPaDgNwEX76wMPU

my point in making the distinction is there because a remittance business, if it has offices here and abroad, dont really need bitcoin at all.  they can just use their own internal ledger that they trust.  bitcoin is only necessary when the people in each country *dont* know and trust each other, and therefore they need a ledger they can trust.  that's why a bitcoin remittance cycle usually involves two different exchanges in two different countries-- person A buys from exchange A and sends BTC to person B who uses exchange B to cash out.  but if exchange A and B are the same company, a remittance business, they don't need to use bitcoin for that transafer, they can just do the transfer internally, and persons A and B have one less step.  bitcoin is only useful to them in areas where trusted companies aren't available or are too expensive.  so like argentina and african countries that WU wont touch -- those are places where bitcoin really has a hole to fill.  everywhere else, it's just a cheaper WU as far as the people involved are concerned -- now dont get me wrong, that's huge in itself, cheaper means more of the remittance gets to the person and that's a big deal.  but im just getting at the distinction of where bitcoin is absolutely necessary for the business model to even work.  and those places in turmoil with unstable money and unstable governments -- places where *trust* is a scare commodity -- those are places bitcoin can really really help.

you want namecoin
you can create a name, like "Logical007" in what's called a "namespace" -- i.e. the type of entry you are making, identity-related things are usually in the "id/" namesapce, so you'd have the name "id/Logical007" and you would have your e-mail and a bitcoin address and any other information you wanted in that, and it would be stored in the namecoin blockchain, which currently gets a large share of bitcoin's mining power because it is merge-mined with bitcoin.
it works just like bitcoin except that non-spendable outputs that store data (sort of like OP_RETURN) are allowed, but unlike OP_RETURN the data is assigned to an address, and the data is used for name entries, and the information assigned to an address expires after something like 8 months, unless that address "spends" it and renews it.
there's a service called onename.io that does all this for you and displays it on a nice website and supposedly only keeps an encrypted version of the namecoin private key, and it's quite popular.  you should try them out.

no, no regulation can be good.  the definition of regulation is that it is forced upon you, not done voluntarily.  im all for businesses joining a bitcoin business bureau and following its guidelines and putting a ฿BB stamp on their window, and the market of reputable trustworthy businesses growing as large as the current regulated corporatocracy.
but to *actually* regulate them requires *force*, and to *force* them to do something requires an *enforcer*, and to have an *enforcer* requires an authority figure who has the power to exert force over others.  that's not an acceptable compromise.
however, i am excited for the idea of "blockchain communities" where business is done primarily digitally and rules are enforced programmatically with smart contracts on a blockchain, so it's voluntary, but it's also "enforced" with the protocol.  that would be a fantastic compromise.  people are forced to keep their word, but nobody is give authority over another.  the best of all worlds.

your research is grossly mistaken then.  integrity is not an issue with seals.  as you say, they've been around for years.  they've fixed all problems they've had, refunded players when things get messed up, and micon puts himself out there as the guy you can go break the legs of if they go running off with your money (plus his reputation is very good in the poker community to begin with).
the reason bitcoin poker isn't as big is because if you can choose between a site that you have to be technically savvy enough to use bitcoin to play on, versus a site that any retarded fish can sign up for, like bovada or something, you're going to go where the fish are.  and if you're a fish, are you going to go through the extra effort of using bitcoins just to play, or just sign up at the easiest place to sign up..?
in short, you've messed up your venn diagram.  you see that most bitcoiners are (or may be) poker players, but you did the other bubble wrong:  most poker players are *not* bitcoiners.  so immediately out the gate, you cut out 90% of your market (assuming 10% of all poker players use bitcoin), and if you're a poker player, whether or not you use bitcoin, are you going to go where 90% of people play or where the most tech savvy 10% play?

That's what I think the most likely integration into society will be for Bitcoin.  It will be co-opted by banks and WU and others who will simply find it a cheaper and more efficient way to do what they already do, replacing SWIFT and similar things, and the average consumer will not know that Bitcoin is the backbone for their fiat transfers.  That sucks, but it's better than nothing, and those who want to use Bitcoin by itself will at least be more easily able to do so.
I'm not thrilled about that being the end game of Bitcoin, I have most of my money in Bitcoin specifically because I don't want to give my business to the banks or let them set the price of my money. But whether I like it or not, I think it's the most probable outcome.

And I ask once again, is that not self-evident to you?  You never actually disputed it, you merely spouted the benefits of Counteryparty over Colored Coins.  Do you genuinely think it's easier to use Counterparty?  Can you honestly say you think it would be easier for most people to use Counterparty over Colored Coins?
I can't prove a subjective view, but I can say colored coins fit all the things that one would generally associate with ease of use.  Less to deal with, simpler options, less time to do things, etc.
Even if I don't know how to prove that walking up a hill is easier than climbing a mountain, it should still be self-evident.
Are you seriously saying that it's not clear to you that colored coins are easier to use?
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:33:30


There is no lock.  The colored coin asset is a bearer certificate.  That's the whole point.  You can use Counterparty to make a smart contract with more limitations on asset use, but the whole purpose of a colored coin is to mark a token which can then be traded as freely as a normal bitcoin.

All you'd need to post is the intermediate code (which in casasciu's utility starts with "passphrase".)  You can post that anywhere, just as you would a stealth address.  Then anybody can create an encrypted private key which they can publicly post.  There's just as little communication as there is with real stealth addresses.
I'm not claiming intermediate codes ARE stealth addresses, I just think it could be functionally used as a stealth address.  We've had bit38 and casascius' utility out for years, and had this very capability, and just didn't know it!
I honestly don't know enough about either topic-- so I don't know how they are actually really different.  Maybe there's some security in one or the other that I don't know about.  But in terms of functionality, it seems to me to be entirely possible to use the intermediate codes in exactly the same fashion.
For example, I randomly generate a "secret", let's call it "password".  Now I use that secret to generate an intermediate code but replace the beginning word "passphrase" in the intermediate code with the capital letter S and get
    SbRQ9g9hJkSTyTBv2QAmbfbBNx8nS3mH2gHcQ2Cucco8XWJTmK4eE4qC7cLM6ys
and call that a "stealth address" even though it's an intermediate code.
Now you can use the "stealth address" aka intermediate code to generate a randomly created address with the encrypted private key "6PgPJDarFgk738ZhwLeED9fPqixSXCz4q8WVNrE3Qz3EdXpxbcCwJWdi7c".  You can also see the public key when you create the address, so you can fund it, but you don't have to post the public key- you can just delete it after you fund it.  The you publicly post the encrypted private key in hex form but replace the first byte 0x36 with 0x03, and you call it a "nonce" even though it's just an encrypted private key, and you post it:
    035067504A44617246676B3733385A68774C6545443966507169785358437A34713857564E724533517A334564587078626343774A5764693763
Nobody without the secret "password", not even the guy who generated it, can decrypt it into an actual bitcoin private key, and nobody but the guy who sent it knows the public address-- you will also know the public address once you decrypt it and derive the public address from the private key.
Bam.  Exact same functionality.
And exact same protection of information.  No eavesdroppers can derive knowledge of a public address from anything that's been publicly posted.  And anybody can randomly generate an infinite number of addresses to fund with encrypted private keys which only you can decrypt.

i don't know, but it's unlikely they were generated using what is essentially shared secret scheme as outlined in the paper, which is just as silly as using a counter starting at 1.  such things are very easy to detect in code.  yes, if i write bitcoin software for you and i create non-random private keys and/or private keys i know or can derive, then that's bad for you.  and if i choose bad k values, or re-use them for signing, both of which would allow anybody to retrieve your private key, then that's also bad for you.

Most people ITT don't seem to get how Bitcoin *isn't* related to this problem.  Bitcoin isn't necessary to settle accounts between trusted parties, because the parties can just trust each other.  If I open a shop in country A and another in country B, and I trust the guys running A and B, we can just use our own internal ledger and it'll be much faster and easier than using Bitcoin, plus we won't have to eat the exchange fees for changing fiat A to Bitcoin back to fiat B, we can just go fiat A to fiat B.
So running a money transfer service doesn't require Bitcoin at all.  Bitcoin is only useful when you *don't* trust other people, but still need to transact with them, so Bitcoin provides a way for you to both be confident the other has done what he said he'll do.
So Bitcoin isn't useful for remittance *businesses*, but it IS useful for an individual person to transfer to an individual person in another country, and bypass the fees associated with using a remittance business.  In fact that's kind of the whole point -- to remove the business in the first place.

There's two ways.  Way one is that it's "backed" by the exchange or entity holding them.  Bitstamp and Bitreserves for example, simply promise to give you dollars for your dollarcoin issued by them.  Despite existing on a blockcahin, they aren't actually using blockchain technology for anything, since they could just keep track of the tokens themselves.  BitUSD and NuBits on the other hand are really interesting, because what they've done is create a decentralized marketplace or at least a voting pool, to trade bets against the currency, so that those bets eat the volatility and the currency itself remains stable.  There's actually potential there.  I don't know much about the NuBits current controversy, but their white paper about this was really fascinating, and it did seem to work reasonably well in practice until the controversy started.

exactly.  bitreserve is like holding money in an exchange.  you're still trusting them to back it and give you your money when you go calling on them.  if you want usd-pegged price stability, bitshares bitusd and nubits are really interesting developments.
i would argue that that's still bad though, because you're still at the whims of the banksters when you peg to usd, but if other people disagree and want usd-pegged prices, it should be noted that there are better (decentralized) ways to go about it.
they are brand new though, so i dont know what to think, but it's interesting at the very least.  nubits white paper was absolutely fascinating.  im still in bitcoin because fuck banksters and usd-based pricing, but academically, nubits is fascinating.
pretty soon here with side chains, you'll be able to buy nubits or other usd-based coins 1 for 1 without eating any exchange rate cost (other than fees), and then do side-chain based atomic swapping, and be able to move in and out of usd-pegged stability coins, and any other coins, trustlessly without any central exchange, and exchanges will just be meeting places and facilitators, but without the ability to hold any money.

Be careful about leading 00 bytes in hex and leading 1's in Base58.  For example, decoding a bitcoin address that begins with a 1 will yeild hex that begins with 00, so if you treat it as a *number* rather than as raw data, that 00 might be lopped off.  0004 in hex is the same number as 04, but 0004 is a different piece of data than 04.  So when you decode with base58, you are treating it as a number and converting the base, but then you have to go back and make sure you have the correct number of leading 00's or 1's, since the number is actually a certain amount of bytes of data and those leading zeros matter.

No, the economy has not increased by the worth of your business.  Your customers have sacrificed a little which has gone into your business.
As for the "added value".  Actual bitcoins don't go into the economy, what happens is that bitcoins are simply valued more highly, so goods and services cost less bitcoins than they did previously.  This allows more people to do more things with bitcoin even though the supply is fixed (or deflating).  In current parlance, it means the price of bitcoin goes up.  So let's say bitcoin has taken over the world and everybody uses bitcoin, and even though USD doesn't exist any more, let's say that if USD did exist the price of bitcoin at that time would arbitrarily be $100,000.
As your business grows, and more people benefit from your service and they thus gain extra time in their day because your service has freed them, they are able to contribute back to society more themselves.  This means more people are doing more work, even though the total supply of bitcoins is the same.  But they still psychologically still value their old work the same amount, they just feel that they are adding even more.
So in growing economies people feel like they are getting and giving more, even though it's really all just back and forth.  This means money is changing hands more frequently, it has a higher "velocity".  Since the supply of bitcoins is limited, and since everybody thinks they are doing more, the "price" of bitcoin, in terms of how people psychologically value it, goes up, let's say again arbitrarily from $100K to $115K.  But since everything is priced in bitcoin, that just means goods and services have a lower price (denominated in bitcoin).
So what this looks like in an all bitcoin economy is as the economy does better, prices of goods and services denominated in bitcoin drop a little bit and the volume of bitcoin transactions goes up, and in bad economies the price of things goes up and the volume of transactions goes down.  That's why the "velocity of money" metric is often used as an indicator of economic health-- because it's very intertwined and related to the actual health of the economy on average.
Now it's worth noting that this isn't a zero sum game, even though it may seem that way from how I've described it.  Value can be created-- and destroyed-- out of thin air.  But any time value is added or taken away in the ecosystem, since bitcoins themselves are fixed, the manifestation of that value is a change in prices.  So using your business example and assuming you did in fact create new value form thin air with your service, you wouldn't have 730 btc at the end of the year, you'd still have 500, but the 500 you have would have more purchasing power than it had at the beginning of the year.

YES.  You absolutely can do this, and assuming you don't have family who would need the money, it's my opinion that that's one of the best things you can do.
As somebody said, download something called Electrum, which will generate a random 12 words which you must memorize.  Those 12 words are, behind the scenes, converted into a 128 bit key, which is very VERY likely to still be secure in 20 years.  Then send bitcoins to any address in that electrum wallet, then delete it.  As long as you've remembered those 12 words, you can re-create it in the future.  Even if Electrum no longer is around or the protocol has changed, \*somebody\* from the future will be able to instruct you on the way to convert your 12 words back and reclaim your money.
Important!  After you delete it, you want to do something called a "secure wipe" of your hard drive, or at least the free space.  Deleting a file from your computer just tells your computer the space is free, it doesn't actually remove the data.  So somebody with the proper tools could potentially read your hard drive and get that wallet file.
If you want more than 128 bits, you can use something called BIP 39 words for an even longer set of words, however that increases the number of words you'd have to remember.
You can also just randomly generate a private key, and encrypt it with BIP 38 encryption, and use a STRONG password that you commit to memory, and then just do something like tattoo the BIP38-encrypted key on yourself.
I personally would recommend just remembering the 12 electrum words.  That's easiest IMO, and should be secure.
If you want to do any of those things and can't figure out how, PM me and I can help out.
All of these things are due to the same simple fact: a bitcoin private key is just a really (REALLY!!!!) big number, like bigger than the number of atoms in the universe big.  It's a 256 bit number.  [And it's secure because it's so friggin' big.](  So any way you can figure out to remember that number, means you can access bitcoins sent to that number.
There is no bitcoin company or clearing house.  Bitcoin has nobody running it.  Inactive funds will not be taken from you.  **Nobody but you can access your money, period.**  *Regardless of laws or judgements against you.*  That big number is the \*ONLY\* key to unlock access to the funds.  Your money is protected by technology.
Now of course, like I said, if that number gets stored on your computer and then somebody gets access to it that way, they can get your bitcoins, because they got access to the number.
But as long as that number is secure, your bitcoins are secure.
Again, PM me if you need help.

You add random letters to the end until when you base58 decode it back into hex, it's 25 bytes long of hex.  Then you just chop off the last four bytes, double-sha256 those first 21 bytes, and then add to the end the first four bytes of the double-sha256.  For example, you start with
    1SomeTextGoesHere
(making sure that you use only proper base58 characters).  Then you add more text to the end, in this case I'll just use X's to fill up the space:
    1SomeTextGoesHerexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
so when I base58 decode it, it's 25 bytes of hex, which are:
    0004e170c2b578eec7aeac375c75163f2a424ec9b719e9dc11
Then I take off the last 4 bytes (8 chars):
    0004e170c2b578eec7aeac375c75163f2a424ec9b7
then I sha256 the raw binary version of that hex and get:
    1f0734ce6c789906ae00c6e9e243d6c217571a93a83e4578411869adf1081d17
and then I sha256 that result and get:
    2abc068de7110e7aa6288d0ff687bdebb3166606ac33a206ed842951ae463c26
The first four bytes of which are:
    2abc068d
So I tack that onto the end of the previous thing and get:
    0004e170c2b578eec7aeac375c75163f2a424ec9b72abc068d
Which I then re-convert back into base58 and get the final bitcoin address of:
    1SomeTextGoesHerexxxxxxxxxxyPuMqW
Base58 encoding is just like base64 or base 10 or base 16, it's just a large number represented in a different way, with more characters.  So that's why the hex changes completely when you just add a single character to the end of a base58 string, because you're not just adding a digit in hex form, you're increasing the number by a power of 58 and then some, so the hex representation of that number is an entirely different number.  So don't be alarmed when you decode base58 and get entirely different hex when you add or subtract a character from the base58 encoding of it.
That's why we filled it with misc characters at the beginning step -- so that we were on the right order of magnitutde, so that when we changed the last chars to be the checksum, the beginning number (and the representing base58 chars) would remain the same.
Base58 encoding really is just converting the base, just as you would convert a decimal number to binary or to hex.  It's just that in bitcoin software, you also pretty much always do that checksum in addition to converting the base, because things like addresses and private keys are things that users may mis-type and so you want the checksum there to make sure the user has typed it correctly and you will know they've messed up if they change a digit.  So the decoding process includes double checking the checksum.
Also, worth noting that base58 denotes 1 for zero instead of zero, since the base58 character set doesn't use zeros.

How can you contribute to a discussion if you don't understand the basics?  You wouldn't go into a physics conference and ask introductory questions about Newtonian mechanics.  The information is widely available, and they'd only be rehashing answers to old questions.  You need to learn enough in the first place to have valid questions to ask.  The discussion only gets interesting when you can explore the topic -- but you can't do that if you don't have the necessary tools to even start the exploration.

Well it would mean a lot to me if you can do that.  It seems very against the ideals of Bitcoin that I am not able to "vote with my mining power" unless I am able to manually build my own altered version -- although the fact that a binary hasn't been built and widely distributed may just mean everybody disagrees with me.  Still, it bothers me that there's not an easy option for lay users who run full nodes and mine.  ("Lay user" being liberally used to mean non-expert...)
I very much disagree with a lot of your views on Bitcoin, but I respect and appreciate that you at least make available the tools for people who disagree.  (And for the record, I'm not the one downvoting you whenever you reply to me.)

In a system where we have the technological ability to make trust unnecessary, you should be wary of anybody asking you to trust them, *no matter how trustworthy they are*.  Merely asking for trust is suspicious in an environment where trust isn't necessary.
But you are right.  People should have the choice.  And unless you fab your own chips and write your own OS and compilers in machine code, at some point you're trusting somebody else.

Those are very special and specific cases.  There's only the two (that I know of at least) where somebody was "legally" compelled to reveal their password in the US.  One was when he had already decrypted part of his computer for LE previously, and the other was when they already had proof of certain things being on the machine.  In each case, those factors were deemed to make it so that compelling the person to decrypt their computer did not violate their 5th Amendment rights.  But the default position is that is DOES violate your rights.  That's a much different legal position than the UK.

THEN if you still think it's a good idea to go into debt that you can afford the money payments on, well then that's your choice.  but damn dude, your plan is just to mooch off your parents.  i mean, i know it's a parent's job to take care of their kid, but once you grow up, you're supposed to be able to take care of yourself.  if you fail at that and have nowhere else to go, then staying with your parents when you're an adult is OK-- but the purpose of that is to help you get back on your feet.  your default plan shouldn't just be "live off my parents forever".  living with your parents is the last resort when you are unable to fend for yourself.  dont get me wrong, if you've genuinely tried and life just fucked you, there's not any shame in taking the last resort available-- but again, it's only until you can get back on your feet.  having that as your main plan is a really shitty thing to do to your folks.  even in cultures where families all live together, there's still generally some point where the responsibilities move to the now-adult children, since the parents have paid their dues.  damn dude, have some respect.  for yourself, and for your folks.

No.  A wallet is just a collection of addresses and the private keys necessary to "unlock" those addresses (i.e. spend their money).  Your client still needs to download the whole blockchain in order to see if those addresses were sent any money.  So just wait until it is "synced" and you will see all your money.  Resetting the settings didn't delete your wallet.  Nothing you can do on accident in the client will delete your wallet.  You'd have to manually go in and delete the file yourself.
Given your level of knowledge, I would not recommend the bulky and confusing Bitcoin Core client.  I think you'd be much happier using "lite" clients like Electrum or Multibit.  You don't have to wait for the blockchain to download with those.  Once you are all synced in Bitcoin Core, you should download one of those lite clients and send your money over to them.  Then backup your Bitcoin Core wallet file, just in case, and uninstall Bitcoin Core.

I disagree, I think it does.  It doesn't matter what the laws are or how thugish the police are if you can use technology to completely bypass them.  Laws that cannot be enforced aren't really a concern to me.


Exactly.  Technology can make it so cost prohibitive to violate liberty that it's just not worth while.
If you keep asking others to *give* you your freedom, you are always going to be disappointed.  Nobody is going to put you above themselves.  Stop asking others to *grant* you freedom, and use technology to take it yourself and ensure you keep it.
It is not the government's job to give you freedom.  You are a free person.  The government's job is solely to *restrict* your freedom in the name of the common good.  You can do anything you want which isn't illegal.  That's what being in a free society means.

Past performance is indicative of likely future behavior.  Even if you think they'll run off *sometime*, if they haven't right away, you at least know that this next time is at least as improbable as other times.  A 200 year old company might suddenly steal all its customer's funds, but the long reputation does indeed provide some assurance that they intend to keep doing business in the manner they have been.
In short, a business with a history is more reliable than a business without a history.
That being said, I actually agree with you.  Although I do trust BTC-e more than most other exchanges, I don't trust *anybody* enough to leave any substantial amount of bitcoins with them.  My personal threat model assumes that exchanges might go under (or steal), and if that happens, all money with them is gone for good.  So I operate with that threat model.  When I want to trade, I deposit, I do the trade, then I withdraw.  I don't day-trade and I don't leave money on exchanges -- that simply doesn't fit in my threat model.  At the end of the day, barring an improbable but not impossible disaster, my money is always solely in my control.  That's the only way I feel comfortable.  I am happy to take the hit on missing arbitrage opportunities in order to make sure that the probability I get "goxed" is very very low.  For the record, I also keep my USD cash in person and only deposit to my bank when it's necessary, usually at the end of each month to pay off the credit cards I've been using to transact in the meantime.

ya this was the proposed solution to using bitcoin for non-trivial amounts but in situations where you couldn't wait for a confirmation.  you give the cashier a private key with more than enough, and they create the transaction and broadcast it and send you the change.  that way double spending is much harder and they know the transaction is legitimate, so the need of waiting for a confirmation is much much less.
then right after that solution was proposed as the protocol for mobile devices, people realized they really just need to focus on getting the world to use bitcoin in the first place and that solution was left in the wind to be replaced by "mention bitcoin to somebody you know, so that they'll use it and we'll actually HAVE the problem we just solved"

This is not a problem for most businesses.  Anybody who runs a 7-eleven or movie theater or anything where they sell stuff worth less than like $50 does enough volume that they could really just not worry about double spends.
There's also a proposal for a solution in which is a bitcoin app that transfers a private key, and then the merchant creates the transaction and pays himself at another address and sends the customer change at a new address.  Then, any half way busy business has a lot to lose by screwing over the customer and a zero confirmation transaction can be considered pretty safe.

you don't need bitcoincard.org.  you can [create an offline transaction yourself]( and simply give the other party a printout of the raw transaction (which is signed with your private key) and then they can broadcast it to the network themselves and check that it's valid.
You can also generate a new key and send the 50btc to that address and just e-mail them the private key.
There's really a ton of ways you can transfer bitcoins offline--it's just that eventually they would need to go back online to claim/verify the bitcoin transfer.  But if your party was willing to meet twice, you could give them say a usb stick with a wallet.dat file (or the raw transaction or the private key) that has the 50btc on it, and then meet them again later for them to give you the money.  And if you're willing to part with a usb stick, you could give half hte btc to them, and then on the second meeting when they give you the full amount in cash, you give them a second usb stick (they return the first) which has the other half of the btc on it.  That way each party only ever risks half the value of the trade and you meet exactly the same number of times as would be required for a full-risk trade.

bots can be detected in various ways with software but collusion and multiaccounting are FUNDAMENTALLY impossible to stop.  It's simply not possible to prevent somebody from having another computer and vpn, or from calling his buddy and telling his cards.
That's not something I would even really worrying about stopping, because one, as I said, it's impossible to stop, and two, none of the impossible-to-stop forms of cheating are all that detrimental.
You can never prevent a (9-max) game from having 8 people colluding and one honest player.  It's just not possible.
But the goal to be focused on is "ok, there's one honest node and 8 corrupt nodes, and a few extra non-playing nodes.  How can we ensure a fair and random deal, and ensure payouts happen.  We can't block 8 people from colluding, but how can we make it so that as long as there is one honest node in a game, all players will get a cheat-free game (other than the 8 players sharing hole card info and adjusting their play)."
That's what needs to be addressed.  Multiaccouting is simply not a concern.  And as a player and a bot-maker, let me assure you, botting is not a concern.  If you think bots are a big deal, you're misinformed.

I prefer on Windows, [Hashcalc](  Then you just have a string or passphrase or file or whatever.  And the sha256 hash of that is the raw hex private key.  So now in Armory you can go to the window where you can enter a raw hex private key, or in btcaddress you can just type the phrase at the top or the raw private key on the right box and those will spit out the WIF private key and the bitcoin address.  Save the public address somewhere and just remember the private passphrase.

"coin age" if you don't understand it simply means that if you start doing that to a point where people are annoyed, it's trivial to put out a patch that every one adopts which will take coin age (i.e. how recently the coins you are spending were previously spent) into consideration and make "younger" coins need a higher fee.
With bitcoin anything is basically possible as long as the miners and users agree on it.  And if some of the big pools decide to implement coin age because you are causing problems, it's likely the community will follow and you'll be SOL.
Just as if bitcoins cyrptography were to be broken tomorrow, bitcoin wouldn't die at all.  The developers and pools would immediately implement a patch using stronger crypto and request that everybody switch over and only accept blocks using the new crypto, and everybody would of course do it because that would be perfectly reasonable, and bitcoin would continue chugging along.
There are already many forks in the bitcoin block chain of people implementing different protocols and trying to get the community to use their new protocols, but the community doesn't so their transactions aren't considered valid by anybody but them... in essence an entirely different currency.
Bitcoin is just too amazing and flexible to be hurt and that's all there is to it.  It can truly adapt to ANYTHING.  It or something like it will be the currency of the future--it's just TOO good.  Once you do the research and see how it works and what its insides look like, you go "wow, this is a revolutionary approach" and you'll understand that bitcoin just has no points of failure.  None.  All of the "hacks" and problems that have cropped up have been because people or corporations poorly protected themselves and thus their private keys got compromised.  The actual core of the bitcoin process has yet to breached, and because of the way it's structured and can adapt to new threats so quickly, it likely never will be breached.  Bitcoin is the future.

to be fair, banning knives will certainly drastically reduce stabbings, it just won't necessarily cut down on violent crime overall.  (additionally, it's worth noting that MORE knives may also reduce stabbings because everybody knows everybody has knives.  we would have to look at the data of ~~gun~~ knife related crime and violent crime / welfare statistics in general to know for sure what works)

yes, [somebody discovered]( that the standard client puts the "change" address first, whereas it was supposed to be unknown (randomly chosen location, so for sending to one address, you have two outputs, the change and the recipient, and you aren't supposed to be able to tell which was which if you didn't already know).  so the code was supposed to make it so you couldn't tell what the "real" transaction was versus the change because the order was randomized, but with the bug, you can more easily isolate likely "real" transactions and thus trace the flow of coins more easily.

Excellent choices, those are the two I would do.  Neither keeps any logs (or so they claim!) and both are easy to sign up for.  Mullvad needs nothing, and Private Internet Access only needs an e-mail (which you can just use a temporary mailbox for).  Both take bitcoins.  I haven't used PIA, but I know the Mullvad openvpn config files shows that you can connect to them through port 80 in situations where you are very firewalled.  I'm only getting 1mb download speed on mullvad though, but that's not the end of the world.
And as primate said, Tor is good for 100% anonyminity surfing but bad for speed and file sharing.  I2P is good for 99.9% anonyminity and reasonable speed and has its own torrent tracker.  And VPN is good for questionable-at-best anonymity and good speeds.  For example, you can watch high def netflix over VPNs without any problem, but you wouldn't do that over tor or i2p.
For OP's situation, I would recommend a VPN, one of the two primate suggested, as well as making sure to route your DNS queries to something like google's 8.8.8.8 or opendns's 208.67.220.220 (which has https dns query capabilities as well).  There's special software called dnscrypt-proxy that you can use to, once you connect to your vpn, route your dns queries through the vpn via tcp to opendns, so you have reliable dns service.  I use that on my laptop when I travel and I firewall it so only openvpn.exe can access the internet, and everything else can only connect to the internet through the local source 10.4.0.0-10.9.255.255 IP address range, this ensures that I'm always secure in public wifi spots, even my dns queries.

It costs a lot of money to move the price.  Even if he does have enough money to make the price go up or down on a whim, he loses a lot by doing so.  And everybody else values bitcoin inherently at some set amount, probably around $5, so he expends some of his money to prove he has a big cock or whatever it is he thinks he proves, and then the market settles, and lots of people are unhappy because they lost money and lots of other people are happy because they made money, and things go back to normal.  There's no long term benefit or harm to the economy, other than temporary confusion, which as I said, is very costly.
tl;dr he didn't actually DO anything.  bitcoin has in herent value, and the market will always eventually reflect that.  if he wants to make sure it doesn't, he'll just inevitably go broke trying to continually manipulate it.  it costs a lot to do that. and then the market will still re-settle.

Bitcoin can adapt to anything.  Somebody just puts in new protocal or encryption or whatever, posts on the forum saying "here, we need this, here's the source code so you know it's legit, please use it" and all the miners switch over, and everybody else switches over, and within a short period of time, the new thing is implemented.  Bitcoin is insanely INSANELY adaptable.
How bitcoin works is that the protocal is whatever the majority of users SAY it is.  So if you convince everybody to use it, then that's what it becomes.
So if encryption is broken, BAM somebody creates bitcoin with better encryption, everybody switches over, and voila, bitcoin keeps on trucking.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean for the caps to be shouting, I was simply trying to emphasize the point.  


They can have a billion, each more powerful than all of the current computing power in the world and it wouldn't matter.  AES is THAT difficult to crack.  Like I said previously, the OP has the title is does for a reason.
I'm not sure how I can persuade you of the truth if you are unable to accept mathematics as fact.  Yes, advances will be made, but they will be additions to current knowledge.  1+1 will never not equal 2.  Similarly, things like evolution and gravity may be expanded, or it will be found that they are symptoms of underlying phenomena, but the facts of their existent and their physical properties will not magically chance.  Newtonian mechanics is still as valid as ever even though we know it's actually not completely correct.
As I said, I don't know how to persuade you if you don't believe in math and physics, so I guess all I can say if you're not willing to do more research yourself is "trust me".  The reason you think the NSA is big and scary and can do many things is because you haven't taken the time to learn about the technology and math behind it.  And that's OK-- you don't need that knowledge to conduct your life.  But I can assure you there are very smart people out there (I'm not one of them btw) who have done the research and do know what is and is not possible.  And cracking AES256 without some kind flaw in it being discovered is just not possible.  Brute force will never break AES.  There MAY BE a flaw in it that hasn't been discovered, but as soon as it is, it will be difficult for even the NSA to keep that secret for long.  That would be the single most important event to happen in current times.  Instantly all communication and security in the entire world would be effectively unencrypted.
I'm sorry if I'm being rude, but your opinions on the topic just don't hold weight when you actually don't know what you're talking about.  And you are saying things which people who read this thread may think are true.  And they're not.  So I get a bit offended by that and feel compelled to make sure people know what's true and what isn't.  The NSA cannot break AES.  They can trick users into giving passwords out, they can get you to install backdoors, they can do many other things to get your encryption passphrase, but they can't fucking crack AES.

@_date: 2012-12-17 16:19:15


That's simply because the agreed upon value (normally expressed in USD) for such small amounts is so small.  If bitcoins reach $100, miners will likely begin to include tx's with smaller fees.  You can also circumvent this by simply sending 1.0001 btc to an address and sending 1 btc right back.  Then the 0.0001 gets left at the desired address and you haven't paid a fee.


Nothing lasts a thousand years (except maybe Rothschild family control of whatever is being used!).  But as far as lost coins go, this is fixed by increasing the number of decimal places beyond 8.  Newer coins aren't minted, so people who have btc aren't punished for their responsibleness of NOT losing coins, and since the supply is decreased by the lost coins, btc in fact goes up in value, so new decimal places are added so that when a bit-penny is worth what a bit-dime used to be worth, you can now just move the decimal place and spend the same penny's worth of value.
Adding decimals is the way to fix the problem, not minting new coins.

actually, that's probably not even really necessary.  obviously it would be a good percaution, but assuming they're checking their e-mail daily and going to transfer the bitcoin as soon as they get the private key, i think theft of bitcoin via their e-mail being snooped, within the time frame of OP's situation, by somebody is unlikely enough to be considered overkill.  but if they use pgp, obviously it's the more secure thing to do.  if they don't think, i still think it's probably OK, although you could also just send the raw transaction
edit: i take it back.  if they use pgp, then using pgp takes so little extra effort that its just as easy to use it.  and if they dont, sending the transaction is similarly easy, and both prevent theft from that address for almost no extra effort
@_date: 2012-12-16 02:17:43
if your phone is rooted, you could use bitspinner or whatever app of your choice is, and then use titanium backup with 4096 encryption to back it up and then uninstall it.  then you can restore the backup whenever you want to use it.  that's pretty secure.  although theoretically it might be possible for a theif to grab the data anyway since apparently wiping solid state drives is more difficult than normal hard disks.

if you want truly anonymous, set up a half dozen mt gox accounts with a vpn, then do a direct cash deposit at a bank, which shouldn't need ID since you are depositing.  then send them all via green address to different SR deposit addresses and never use that vpn or those mtgox accounts or that chase bank branch again.  (does SR let you get a new deposit address? i assume it would.)
and THAT's not even "truly" secure.  i could explain a way to get them TRULY anonymously, but you want them FAST, which is more difficult.

well it's not just the chargebacks, it's the difficulty of catching somebody who does that, combined with the irreversability of bitcoin.  so it's like hanging a sign on your business that says "bitcoin criminals, come take advantage of me!  you can't get caught, and i can't retaliate!"
similarly, nobody is will to be the first guy to prove that running around in a firing range is a bad idea... everybody just kind of thinks it's obvious.  whereas in online stores, you still have to get your product shipped somewhere and to somebody-- so the theif's identity is exposed-- and in real life transactions, there are security cameras and such, so again, the risk of being exposed and caught is high.
when you buy bitcoins however, you can use a stolen card, using a proxy for your internet, and buy bitcoins sent to a newly created bitcoin address... making it impossible to tell who you are.  so like i said, everybody just kind of understands that it's asking to be taken advantage of.
you could still do it-- you'd just have to get insurance and factor the thefts and cost of insurance and on and on into the cost of the sale, and then it would be so expensive that only criminals would find it useful, since regular customers wouldn't pay such high fees.

No I'm offering to let him defraud me. I'm selling the btc. Also, no, my offer is actually too high. There is a market stabilization point for paypal trade. It just involves accounting for the fact that I'd have to buy a few verified accounts, cycle the money around, and make sure Paypal got hit with the chargeback, not me. And that's difficult because they might monitor the transactions and prevent me from doing my process, so sometimes I still take the hit. But all that effort still lends to a price of maybe $18 a coin. If he's willing to pay $30 and wait for me to ship the money off to another account before sending the btc, I'll take the risk.

Or he could just give the merchant the private key for an address with more than enough to cover the owed amount, and they create the transaction and send him the change, and then wait 5-10 seconds to make sure a double spend hasn't been initiated by him.  I guess he could still send out a double spend with a higher tx fee (after the 10 sec waiting period) and hope for the best, but iirc i think older transactions generally have priority when there is conflict, specifically for preventing double spends.

if you are worried you should use your own desktop client.  search for "lite" clients-- these are ones that connect to a server to see if you have money, but your private keys are actually on your own computer, so you can back them up however you want, and if the server goes wonky you still can get your money.  obv i recommend using the official client with the big bulky blockchain and all, but i think a lite client (one that doesn't use the blockchain but isntead asks a server what the blockchain says, and is thus always quick and easy) is an OK compromise.  I like the [electrum client for windows]( for this purpose.

I must downvote because you completely miss the point of the price going up...  The higher the price, the larger the market cap, which means the further into the mainstream economy bitcoin can go.  If bitcoins are $1000 a pop, it's not good because "oh boy I'm an early adopter/speculator and now I can retire"...  the high price is good because "oh boy now the market cap in USD is seven billion dollars, and bitcoins can be used as a medium of exchange for much wider ranging markets and will thus be used by many more people."

And you read it here first:  the price of bitcoin will go DOWN in December through mid January, because that's how psychology works.  People won't look at it as "oh bitcoin is more valuable because it's harder to get"... they'll look at it like this: many miners will quit and sell their stuff because mining is no longer profitable, they will sell their bitcoins and consider it a good run.  The price will drop as sell orders come in and the economy will shrink.  Bitcoin will go back below $5 before New Years.

There is no standard.

And because hashes' outputs are so radically different, unless you link the public addresses somehow through their use, nobody will know that all those addresses were generated from similar passwords.

Ah, so you don't understand how the future will work.
Consumers don't buy digital products any more.  It's cheaper AND easier to pirate them.  Therefore, the money the producers make will necessarily come from watermarks and other non-intrusive advertisements embedded within the product itself.  Visible enough to warrant ad money, but not annoying enough to warrant having hackers take it out of the product.  For example, Google pays Mozilla millions upon millions of dollars per year to make that special google firefox page the default home page, and consumers actually LIKE it on top of that!
Additionally, great products and service will always get customers.  For example, Valve's games are pirated but they also have a very loyal and dedicated fan-base that pays for their products and services, and Valve, despite making only digital things which can be pirated, is doing amazingly, because they have excellent service, a customer-oriented business model, and they make buying and using their products easy and friendly.
Dropbox is a great idea and a great company. The people who make it will find ways to market it.  I whole-heartedly support them.  And if I ever need hundreds of gigs of their service, I will gladly pay for it.  As it is, I will take what I can get, and I will be perfectly happy knowing I am helping push their company towards the direction that all future companies must inevitably go, like it or not, in order to compete.
Also, not paying for it is cheaper for me.

in this vein, you can send to a new address you created, something like the following set of transacitons:
although they might show up as
and then you could create a single transaction to send a small amount from that address to the person you want to contact and the rest back to an address you own, emptying out the account, but leaving the message.
This way, you can create an arbitrarily long message by sending yourself coins, and since you will always be sending more than 1 btc, you can do it without fees as well.
You just have to hope the person with the address will go look you up on block explorer because they are curious as to who and why you sent them coins.  Sending coins is simply an unsolicited ping or "hello" -- you really are relying on the receiver to act upton the ping in a certain way, since you can't give them instructions, only a single message of "I just sent you money".  You just have to hope they respond in a given manner.

Right, the fact that a certain bitcoin address is linked to you is OK as long as you still are the only one who can control that address, because you can launder bitcoin to and from that address, so you get to choose how much money that address has and it'll be very difficult (or as hard as you want it to be) to show any link between that address and other addresses, assuming you washed your coins to any extent.  A simple run of coins from your main bitcoin wallet to MtGox, then out a green address to over your google wallet would be enough for now even.

As always, it comes down to fear and ignorance.  They don't know much about it, they just know it's internet money.  They've heard of internet money come and go before, so why would this be any different.  And why would they want to hop on board when they can already use Paypal for internet money.  Then on top of that, apparently bitcoin is super not safe because it's been hacked a dozen times.  Why would they even touch bitcoin then!
The ignorance combined with the misonformation, combined with the fact that the whole bitcoin protocol, while ingenious, is a bit hard for the layperson to grasp why it's necessary-- all that mixed together makes bitcoin confusing and scary and seem unsafe.  And once they've already decided it's not safe, why would they ever bother researching it beyond that, since they're not going to use it anyway?
When I found bitcoin, being the crazy type of goes balls deep into most things, I immediately spent 2 or 3 hours reading up on how it worked, without any per-judgement (I hadn't heard about it before hand), and with my understanding of how crypto works, I immediately saw the benefit and usefulness and genius of bitcoin.  But I don't expect the average person who doesn't need it and who thinks USD is great to see that benefit, especially when the barrier to entry is so much higher than for most things.  In order to switch over, you have to completely change your mind about what money is.  That's a big step that I don't expect most people to take until the collapse is at their doorstep (and they see it).
Some people will never appreciate it.  That's just life.

This is a terrible idea. Now a scammer just buys a lot of coins and is free to rip people off- let alone the ludicrous notion of cash being "tainted". I'll take that tainted money if you don't want it! Besides this problem has been solved in two ways already. First, escrow services. Second, escrow in the protocol itself via multi-sig transactions, which I expect to be in the official client fairly soon.

Of course you route around it... :-)   What fucking central nodes are you talking aobut?  Do you even know how bitcoin works?
A DDoS attack on nodes like lukejr's site or other main fallback nodes is of course routed around.  The clients can't connect to it, so they ROUTE AROUND IT by connecting to other nodes.  You know how you can "addnode=" in the config file?  Do you know how easy it is to solve that ddos attack problem.  A bunch of community members jump on the forums or reddit or TOR whatever is still open and publish their IP's and run full nodes.
Let's say every main fallback node is gone and the forums are down.  Reddit and others would be overrun with people posting their IP's and Gavin or garzick or somebody else would post a pgp-signed message here with an I2P magnet link to a postman torrent with a new version with a new IRC channel for bootstrapping or something.
It would cause a momentary problem that would immediately be overcome with very little effort on the part of the community.
And that's the WORST case ddos where every single fallback node, the irc channel, and multiple websites are unreachable.
Even buying up all the coins doesn't work, because then the coins people already have become worth more, and mining becomes more profitable, and the total upper limit simply goes from 21m down to say 15m if they buy up 6 million.
The only viable attack against bitcoin is the 51% attack, which must be ONGOING and sustained, which is pretty costly.  Do-able, but costly.
@_date: 2012-10-04 21:04:57
Actually no, the fee is much different. First, it goes back into the economy, second, it's optional- your transaction will just take longer to get into a block- and third, the fee will always be very low compared with fees you're used to. As you can see, aside from all the other differences from credit cards, even the optional fees are much better!
@_date: 2012-09-22 23:13:23
Wat? Nothing you're saying makes sense or is how bitcoin works. As far a getting Alice's money, her wallet addresses are protected by encryption stronger than anything most banks or governments use.  It's truly impossible for an attacker to guess, even with plenty of time. The attacker would need access to her computer and copy the file, and even that only works if Alice didn't take the additional step of encrypting that file, which is an option in the bitcoin-qt client.

Instead he bowed down and flipped out, flipped out, banning somebody for flippantly suggesting we market bitcoin to a country that could use it.

I disagree. The bitcoin economy is small enough that it's main value is the ability to exchange it with fiat. Ergo, the bitcoin is tied to the dollar. The price increase has nothing to do with people losing faith in dollars and euros, and in fact if the dollar goes down, I would wager that the cost of a bitcoin in dollars would fall as well.
@_date: 2012-08-11 06:17:32
1.  There are no servers.  The bitcoin software connects directly to other computers running bitcoin software.  So any transactions that get "published" to the "network" go from the guy who made the transaction to all the computers that he's directly connected to, and then all of those computers send it out to all of the ones that they're connected to, and within a fraction of a second, every single person is aware of the transaction.  Then, the transaction is eventually included in what's called the "blockchain" which is simply a big ledger list of transactions, which basically has a final tally of how much money each bitcoin user has.  (I say "user" but it's really an address, a series of numbers/letters that can't be traced to you as a person, and you can get an unlimited number of addresses if you want.  So the blockchain actually records how much each address has.)
2.  Since every person using bitcoin has this ledger of how much bitcoins are in each address, if a transaction goes around the network and says it has more bitcoins than everybody knows it can have, all of the computers running the software will reject it as fake, and it will never show up in the blockchain, which means any future transactions that use that address and that are legitimate will have priority and go through and work.
If it doesn't make sense, I'll go the even easier route:
1.  There's no server, through magic, your computer magically connects only to other computers using bitcoin, and you all magically work together to make it work.
2.  Through the magic of cryptography, bitcoins cannot magically be created.  Even though they are digital, they cannot be copied.  Because of magic.

yes.  bitcoin is fine.  what was robbed was a company with poor security practices.  smart bitcoin people dont keep a lot of money sitting on a single exchange.

bitcoin itself is MUCH more secure than your normal checking account.

Firstly, that says nothing about why that would or would not work.  Secondly, even if the article had mentioned it, it would be wrong, because OF COURSE what I said will work.  It MUST work; it can't not work.  Miners can just refuse transactions without high enough fees, thus creating their own incentive.  Then if other miners accept lower fees often enough that they make more by just accepting a lot of lower fees, then the high-fee-wanting miner will lower his requirements and an equilibrium will develop.  This is very basic economic theory.

why the fuck are you keeping coins with somebody else who you don't know and can't trace.
the point of bitcoin is control of your own money.  if you are going to use a "bank" and trust others with it, use a reputable well known web-wallet service.  blockchain.info has a relatively cheap mixer if super anonyminity is important to you.  you can also just mix your coins, sent them to your own client with a new wallet, and then only open the client when it's proxied through tor.  then you're just as anonymous, but you still have control of your money

Still, I don't like that we're encouraging miners and other current full nodes to prune and not hold the blockchain.  The only way to for a new node to validate that the network is correct is to get a full and complete copy of the blockchain.  The fewer people that have that, the less safe the network is.  I maintain a full node and will never prune for this very reason.  The blockchain needs to be widely available.

My thoughts are that it speaks like pretty much all economists -- vaguely and without any useful actionable information.  You basically said "the price may or may not go to 200 and from there may go up or may go down".  Like I said, analysts always seem to have great 20/20 hindsight, but I'll start paying attention when the specific falsifiable predictions start coming true.  Until that time, I honestly don't feel your reasons are remotely justifiable since they don't lead to any useful information.  Somebody can tell me all the ins and outs of tarot card reading and get as detailed and specific as they want about their reasoning and what this card or that card means, but at the end of the day, without results to back it up, it's still as worthless as ever.  So when economists and analysts talk about their tarot cards, err I mean technical analysis and candle sticks, I ask for evidence.  "That's a great theory you've got there; it'd be a shame if someone... tested it."
@_date: 2015-04-18 01:48:41
put it back in the same place and run bitcoin.exe but with the "rescan" option.  so, for example, if you had a shortcut for bitcoin that lead to:
    "C:\Program Files\bitcoin\bitcoin.exe"
just change the shortcut target to:
    "C:\Program Files\bitcoin\bitcoin.exe" --rescan
and run it.  It'll take a while, but it will get your money back.  That option tells it to look at your wallet file as if it's brand new, and rescan the entire blockchain history for transactions associated with those addresses.
So if you move computers or something, just download the whole blockchain again, and then replace the wallet file, and then run that rescan option.
Edit: Next time, use a different wallet.  You really shouldn't be using Core unless you have a specific reason for doing so. If you're just a normal user, a lite wallet like Electrum is what you should be using.

Non-violence is a principle for offense.  But *defense* may require violence.  After all, between non-violence and violence, violence wins.  If I want what you have, if I can forcibly overpower you, then I can just take it, regardless of your protest and appealing to others and so forth.  Your appeals to others only mean something to me if others will defend you, which if they are also non-violent, doesn't mean anything.
So violence, and the threat of violence, is actually what underpins peaceful cooperation.  The thing which dissuades me from using violence against you is the threat that you will use violence against me in defense of yourself, or that others will come to your aid and use violence against me in defense of you.  So my well-being is harmed by my violent action against you... but only when you have a credible threat of violence against me.
That's why you hear martial artists talk about hoping they never have to use their craft -- they genuinely mean it.  Non-violence is only possible society-wide if the members of the society are *capable of violence*, if there is a *threat* of defensive violence.  It's a game theory equilibrium.  Violence is no longer an economically viable means of achieving one's goals, and so cooperation is the next option.
And as you may have deduced, refusing violence even for defense may actually encourage others towards violence because they know they can get away with it.  So morally, non-violence may actually not be the highest level.  Offensive non-violence is perfectly reasonable, but the threat of defensive violence is absolutely necessary for peaceful non-violent cooperation.
The reason non-violent movements have worked in the past is because such actions won the hearts and minds of supporters of the movement who either were violent or otherwise had sway over the oppressors.  It wasn't the superiority of non-violence as a tactic in and of itself, it was its superiority as a mechanism of inspiration in order to get intervention by those more powerful and violent.
In short, when you refuse to be violent for defense, you allow offensive violence to be economically viable.
TL;DR offensive violence bad, defensive violence good.

OP, you clearly don't understand how supply and demand works.  It's not that easy to arbitrage, the market won't allow it.  If somebody had 10,000 and sold them all really fast, that would drive the price down, but then as he was buying them back, it would cost him more than he made selling them.  This is because all the people who were willing to buy as he was selling them want to make a profit, so they, and the market on average, won't re-sell them for less.  A few might, but not many.
Markets aren't that easily manipulated like that.  That's just not how the world works.

The technology is here, and it works a certain way.  The fact that you and most people consider it stealing doesn't magically negate the fact that it delivers content better than the vast majority of ways we can get it otherwise.  Piracy delivers content in the format and manner you want it, when you want it, and without all the extra crap you don't want.  That's a service and content delivery issue.  The fact is that most content simply isn't worth what artists and distributors think it should be worth.  And the cost for distribution is now effectively zero.  Bitching and moaning about how unfair life is is a sure-fire way to get left behind in the new digital age.  I'm sure Blockbuster was really upset about piracy, but you know what, it's a good thing they're out of business.  They don't offer a service that is useful any more in this day and age.  If you want your content to make money, then you can crowd-fund it and not create it unless it gets funded.  That's a perfectly viable model which ensures that all content you create is adequately paid for.  "Oh but that won't work." -- You're right, it won't.  Because most of the time, you won't get the funding.  That doesn't mean you're losing money, it means your content isn't worth what you think it is.  That's just a fact of reality.  You are competing in a new market with different rules.  Calling that "stealing" is to completely fail to understand how the world works and how to adapt to it.

It is an important problem that should be considered, but there's two things that should make you personally not have to worry about it.  The first one is that transaction fees and bitcoin prices should make it so enough people keep mining-- after all, the mining difficulty depends on the number of miners, so there will always be an equilibrium where at least some number of people will mine.  But let's say for arguments sake that you feel that number is low enough to be a risk... that brings up to point  this won't even be a problem for over 100 years, so there's plenty of time to find and implement a solution.
@_date: 2011-06-16 23:02:20
Please do show me how to implement that in a multiplayer game.  Please also show me how a P2P network will "randomly choose" the players.  Please also explain how it can be protected from a reasonably large amount of the network colluding to rig the deck the times when they are chosen.  And don't paste that damned mental poker link again.  It's the nth time somebody has showed that and said "see, it's solved".  That doesn't work for the type of game we're talking about.  We're talking about a non-HU game that can be verified by the network BEFORE the fact without giving away information.
@_date: 2011-12-16 11:00:06

Right, you need some time for a transaction that originates in Place X to propogate all over the network before the next block is solved, otherwise you get a shit-ton of forked chains over and over again that all return to the main chain, but that means a lot of people's transactions simply don't happen because their blocks get invalidated.

You can't do that.  THat's one of the beauties of Bitcoin.  His wallet.dat may be compromised, but that's his fault.  And you can 100% prove a transaction occured thanks to the blockchain.  Claiming you never received something is not possible with Bitcoin.  You can claim it went to the wrong address, but given how long the addresses are, that's unlikely, and it can be proven that a transaction DID occur.

The internet DOES provide that.  It's simply an OPTION not an OBLIGATION.  You can store your bitcoins with a trusted third party and if they're stolen, the third party will simply erase the stolen coins.  Like what happened on Mt Gox.  They got hacked, but then they reversed all the transactions so the hacker never got anything.  But you don't HAVE to keep your bitcoins with them.  If you want to be responsible for your own money you can be.  It's about force versus choice.  What you are arguing for is FORCING the community to not be able to take MONEY, which is dumb, but I as an individual can CHOOSE not to accept the bitcoins that trace back to the bad addresses.  But money is money, and if I need money and can't be too discerning, you forcing me to not accept certain money only hurts me without helping the victim.
@_date: 2011-06-01 21:52:58
That's not how it works.
Your wallet contains 100 addresses to start, but for my explanation, let's just say it only contains 1.  So you have this one address the first time you start bitcoin.  Say you get 50 btc sent to that address the first time you mine (or buy them and have somebody send them to you).
Then let's say you make a new address for another transaction and get 6 btc sent to that.  So your wallet now contains 56 btc, but behind the scenes all that really is is two separate addresses, one with 50 btc and another with 6 btc, and the bitcoin client simply adds them together.
Now, when you want to send 53 btc to somebody else, your bitcoin client automatically grabs money from BOTH of those addresses and tells the network "OK I'm taking money from these two addresses and giving it to this address."  I'm not quite sure how it decides how much to take from each of your two addresses, but anyway, the end result is that now one of your two addresses has a balance of zero, and the other one has a balance of 3 btc, or possibly they each have a balance of 1 or 2 btc, for a total of 3 in your wallet.  Again, I'm not sure how it decides how much to take from each address.
So now when you look on block explorer at that 53 btc transaction, there's two addresses in the "from" because it took two of your addresses to make that transaction happen.
The wallet spits out a new address when you get money simply because the bitcoin client assumes you want a new address for each transaction.  That's not integral to how it works though, and theoretically you could program a working client that doesn't do that.  I have like 20 blank new addresses myself, which is a little annoying in the address book, but I'll survive somehow.  Worst case scenario is that it gets to burdensome and I make a new wallet, send all my money to one address, record the names and addresses that I need from my old wallet, and just move over to a new wallet, having backed up my old wallet, and maybe once a month just double checking to see if anybody has sent anything to the old wallet.  If I was a programmer, I could just export the keys for the addresses I use and even import them into the new wallet, but I'm not smart enough to use Gavin's tools to do that, or to use them to simply remove the extraneous addresses.
@_date: 2011-06-18 15:51:17
No, and here's why:  How bitcoin works is any transactions that happen are broadcast publicly to EVERYBODY via the blockchain, and only your wallet file is able to pick out transactions to your address and say "hey those are mine, I can claim them".
So whenever you open the client and it's downloading the newest blocks, if you were sent a payment, at some point in the downloading, your client would update and show that you have money.
I know people who created a wallet file and wrote it's addresses down, and then printed out the code of the wallet file onto PAPER and deleted the original file, and they have their savings in that.  There's not even any client or file or anything.  And all they have to do to get back the money is re-compile the wallet file, install the bitcoin client, and download the blockchain, and then their re-compiled wallet file will look at the block chain and say "oh hey those are my payments!".
@_date: 2011-08-17 12:19:13
Have you finished downloading the blockchain?  That's the most likely problem.  Is your transaction listed somehwere here:
If it is, and it's a valid transaction, then it may have just been for such a small amount that it's not yet included in a block, although by now I think it would have been.  Something happened to make it not a valid transaction most likely, which means you still have your coins, and you'd just need to rescan the block chain to get them back in the client.
@_date: 2011-06-20 03:56:47

Secondly, it's only money laundering if it's switching money around specifically to turn money gotten through ILLEGAL activities into clean cash.

TO PEOPLE WHO THINK THIS IS REAL:
It's not possible to make false transactions, even with the vast majority of the network.  The most a network majority can do is double-spend money coming from its own addresses.  Bitcoin addresses are actually the public keys of a cryptographic private/public key-pair, and as such, the private keys are ONLY stored in the wallet file.
It's not possible to make up transactions coming from somebody else's address.
All they can do is send Person A money, and then send Person B money, and then in a few blocks, Person A's client un-does the money transfer because it's told that it wasn't a valid transaction....  ie the double-spend.  As far as the network goes, it just assumes that Person A's transaction never happened.
It's pretty much like paying Person A on Paypal, doing a chargeback, and then using that same money to send to Person B, except with the bitcoin method, you can send to both people before you chargeback on Person A... but you'd need over half of the network's mining power to do the chargeback.
The claims OP is making are simply not possible.

Bitcoin over Tor is fine.  The only potential issue is SPV nodes de-anonymizing you, which you can fix by mixing your coins.  But as for these attacks, they're very specific and rely on a lot of things that don't happen.  SPV nodes use SSL.  And proof of work can't be faked-- that's why it's called proof of work.  If you're running a full node over Tor and really truly worried, you can also just open up any block explorer website and compare the most recent block hash to what you have to make sure you're on the best "fork".  And you can be almost completely sure you're good if you add a few onion connections and a few non-onion connections, so you are able to cross reference what your exit node is feeding you against the onion nodes.
This is one of those articles that says "see this theoretical attack, it completely destroys X" without realizing that in practice, none of the conditions are ever met for the attack to take place, and the few times they are, they don't remain and the fork gets fixed and you re-broadcast your old transactions, and so the amount of people actually hurt by the attack is maybe one.
Don't get me wrong, this kind of research is certainly useful and worth knowing.  It's just not some huge disaster, and it certainly doesn't make Bitcoin over Tor a bad idea, as OP's title and the article suggests.

That's simply a solution to the "hard problem that your computer is solving when it's making bitcoins" but a REAL block is a very specific solution to the hard problem.  The "block" you found may or may not turn out to be that very specific solution, usually not, but it gets sent to the pool as proof that you are actually trying to solve the problem, and thus it counts as "work" (or a share) towards your part of the payment when the "real" solution is found and new bitcoins are generated.

There's a much easier way to spend money to destroy bitcoin.  Just buy up a ton of mining power, and slowly introduce yourself into the system over the course of like 5 years.  Then people think bitcoin is just getting more popular, but really, you're controlling like 75% of the network.  Then, because the blockchain has records of every transaction, you can see how much BTC every single address ever created has.  Then you very very swiftly make false transactions that send their BTC to you.  Boom, you have instantly wiped out every BTC account and control all of the mining power so nobody else can get new BTC.  That entire operation would cost less than $100M.

It's not a digital identification of each bitcoin, it's simply a trail from one address to another back to the original creation of them when they were "mined" by a created block.  Except the trail gets exponentially harder to follow since transactions spread out over time, and also every time a transaction occurs the entire balance of an address is emptied, and if there is leftover, it's simply sent to a NEW address IN THE SAME wallet.
But when you're looking at the transaction log, you only know that if you check the "first time seen" for every address in the transaction.  Additionally, stolen bitcoins can go into "mixing pot" like a big exchange where they get meshed with other coins (e.g. mt gox's 400K stash) and then those same coins withdrawn, at which point it's truly impossible to tell where they came from without having access to Mt Gox's databa--OHWAIT
Also, as a merchant or consumer or user, do you really want to have to go through the trouble of trying to find the history of every piece of money you use.  Would you write down the serial number of every $20 USD bill you got and go look it up online to see if it's stolen?  And even if it is, maybe it was stolen last month and passed through Vegas casinos (aka "mixing pot"), and the guy who handed it to you truly is an innocent person who thought it was good money.
What you're proposing OP is not only not viable, it's also unethical.  In order to implement it, you'd have to trace all money, and one of the whole points about bitcoin is its lack of authority and its anonymity factor.  I feel for you-- you think you have a good idea to stop bad people from doing bad things.  But the cost for all good people to pay is too high.  Sometimes people have to suffer.  The cost of living in a free society is that bad people are free as well, and when everybody has rights and is innocent until proven guilty, sometimes bad people take advantage of that.  But you can't let that sway you from claiming your rights.  To quote Ben Franklin:  "Those who would give up essential liberties for temporary security deserve neither."

P2P poker is not yet possible.  It would be if everybody was honest, but the problem occurs when you have a game where one guy has hacked his client and tells his opponents "hey that's not right, my client tells me that that hash is incorrect.  Since it's P2P, who do you believe?"  The only current solution to this is some kind of trust network like on bitcoin-otc where highly trusted players either run the game or at least have their clients monitoring each game and they are the official decider of disputes.  But that still requires them as a trusted third party.  Pure P2P poker is not yet possible.

OP, that's jsut because psychologically people don't like weird numbers.  And charging 0.00000029 bitcoins for something is a weird number.  By "move the decimal" they just mean change the software GUI to display your total BTC in whatever unit you want to call BTC*10^(-8), let's call that unit Satoshi's for fun.  That way you can charge 29 Satoshi's instead of 0.00000029 bitcoins.  It's EXACTLY the same thing, but 29 Satoshi's jives better with consumers.

The fact that I need to explain to you why this is retarded exemplifies your inability to make judgements here.  Yes, science is often wrong, but it's always at present the best information we have.  When you disagree with the most accurate up to date information, you're effectively claiming that you either have information nobody else has or you have made new equations/inferences that nobody else has.
That's lofty in itself, and while it may be true, it's unlikely.  However, when it happens, even if people don't like to accept it, your conclusions and data speak for themselves and will inevitably eventually be accepted.  A new discovery in math is easily verified, because math is logically derived from prior math.  A new discovery in physics is testable and repeatable.  There's no just room for argument.
But you haven't done any of that.  What you've done is looked at the available information, outright ignored it, and then claimed that you are right.  That's just retarded on the face of it.  The fact that other past scientists have been ignored or persecuted is completely irrelevant to you and your position -- you're not doing any kind of science at all, you're just ignoring data.
And of course I'm open to changing my mind.  I *was* a climate skeptic, because the debate was so politicized I couldn't easily find facts about it, so I thought there was a good chance it wasn't the big deal people were claiming.  So I did the research, and found out yup, it's real and it's human-caused.  Of course I'm open to changing my mind, but only when evidence and logic dictate that I must.  I don't just go willy nilly believing random bullshit just for the sake of open mindedness.  That's not open-mindedness, that's retardedness.

there are also chips that will keep the key encrypted inside the cpu IIRC, or something where the cold boot attack doesn't work and getting the hardware itself is useless.
i will have an answer for everything you can think of.  that's my point -- the technology DOES WORK.  if you use it properly, it's possible to thwart adversaries.  yes, there are all kinds of far out possible threats and bleeding edge advances in the cat and mouse game, but if you stay up to date with current events, you can stay ahead of the curve.  you're listing more and more remote possibilities and eventually i will of course have to say "well ya if A *and* B *and* C all happen at once, this far out thing might happen".  but that's a poor argument.  a private key also isn't technically impossible to brute force.
at some point the likelihood of compromise is so low and the cost of doing it is so high that you can pretty much just call your setup good enough for any threat you'll encounter.  unless i get to be as sought-after as bin laden, my setup is going to be secure for my purposes.

It's safe. You give them a public key generated from a random new private key, and they generate a private key and add its public key to the one you gave them. If the result is what you're looking for, they give you that private key, which you can add to your private key to get the resulting private key for that address. They never have access to the private key.

You use your smartphone.  The store simply has a QR code glued on the register and your Bitcoin app, whenever it comes out, recognizes that as a BTC address, and pops up with a "Send Bitcoins" window where you just enter the amount and hit send.  It should in fact be pretty easy.  The store can then verify it right there, and just accept zero or one confirmation as a risk of doing business, unless the purchase is over like $100 worth of BTC.
Alternatively, store fronts could accept actual wallets or addresses, and your bitcoin smartphone client simply transfers money to an address (on that same client), then exports the private key and mails/texts it to the store, who has software to automatically import it, and automatically send the money to a new address.  Then they don't even have to worry about confirmations.

I think it's very unlikely that they'd do that specifically because it might screw people over.

The data is the proof.  It shows a dramatic increase ever since farming became popular, and another huge increase with automobiles.  Steeper rises than the changes between most dramatic changes in all of history.  Additionally, the fact that a steep change has happened a few times in history doesn't negate anything.  The chance of it occurring naturally at this time, with those factors, is still relatively small.  Especially when we know those factors contribute to exactly what causes the effects we are seeing.  Correlation often does not imply causation, but in this case, we've done numerous tests about the causal factors and can say with confidence that this correlation does indeed matter.  I'm sorry but the data is very clear.  Your ignorance and dismissal of it doesn't actually negate it.

I'll pay you Popmoney, Paypal, Liberty Reserve, or Dwolla if you'll sell me your BTC for $6.50 a pop.  I can do up to a few thousand USD, but since I'm not really looking to buy, you're going to have to take the price hit.  I won't do it above $6.50.
To answer your question more specifically, you need to make it worth a buyer's while to do the trade.  The reason you are finding it hard to sell them is because you expect to get more than you should reasonably expect.  If few people are interested in buying, you're going to need to make it "worth their while" by lowering your pricing standards in order to incentivise more buyers to buy from you.
Although I don't expect you to take me up on my offer, I'm pretty sure if you go on OTC and say you're selling 100 BTC for $7.50 a pop via Dwolla, you'll get a buyer pretty damned quickly.

sort of.  if the market at large loses faith in bitcoin and the price drops, miners will simply stop mining, so the theoretical floor isn't really a hard limit or anything.  but the cost of mining is a very real barrier that is a large part of the market psychology and price.  mining is inherently speculative -- miners do it not just for immediate reward but also because they believe in bitcoin and believe that the price will go up in the future, so they sell the minimum necessary to keep their equipment going and keep the rest as btc.  and what they think the price *ought* to be guides their buying and selling choices, and creates a significant amount of constant market pressure to stay above that floor.
this isn't about how bitcoin works, it's about how economics and psychology work.

What if players have confederates with rigged software?  What happens when disputes arise?  That's the problem with not having a trusted server.  How do you protect honest peers from non-honest peers without delegating?  Some one once told me that the logic involved with that question is similar to the logic involved with the way DRM licensing is working (or not), and if Microsoft and others haven't figured out a way around it, I'm not hopeful.

There's no good way to do it.  You have to know how to manually do it yourself from the seed.  I have a little python script I wrote to do it, but there's no actual good tools available like there are for standardized BIP 32/39/44 wallets.
How badly do you want this?  If you can't run python, and if you trust me, I can make a little Windows GUI app to do it for you.
**EDIT:** I wrote a script to do just this and compiled it into a little Windows console app.  You can download the zip file [here]( and then just extract everything into a folder and run "electrum-seed-to-xprv.exe".  Changing the name of the exe bricks it, I don't know why.  After the xprv key is shown, right click and hit select all, then hit enter to copy everything to the clipboard, then enter again to exit.  The clipboard copy has a carriage return in the middle of the key, so make sure to reconstruct the whole key together after you paste it.

Faster confirmations provide no extra security.  Assuming same algorithm and same difficulty, four 2.5min confirmations is roughly as secure as one 10 min confirmation.
Additionally, this whole notion of zero confirmations being worthless is ridiculous.  If it's a valid and standard tx and there's no double spends in the mempool, the tx is *extremely* likely to go through.  For anything less than say a few thousand dollars worth of value, accepting zero confirmation tx's is going to be fine.
The reason Litecoin is valuable is because it has a reasonably large miner-base and mines scrypt.  So it's a reliable safe-haven in the event that SHA-2 gets cracked.  It's silver to Bitcoin's gold.  But the quicker confirmation time aspect is basically worthless.

I use Coinbase's vault when I purchase Bitcoins from them -- they have an option to put the Bitcoins in the vault when your purchase goes through.  That's the only time I've used it.
I am super paranoid though, and only trust myself to keep my Bitcoins safe, and while Coinbase's vault theoretically is safe -- it's *possible* that it doesn't work the way they claim or that somebody on the inside might inject bad code into the JS scripts or something.  So remote possibilities like that are still too much for me to feel safe about.  But I strongly suspect it's fine, and like I said, assuming it works the way they claim, it truly is safe, even in the event they go under -- because they genuinely do not have access to the coins, only you do -- they just provide the web interface.
(But of course, if has to be not hacked every time you enter your vault password on the site, and I don't have the patience to check the scripts the websites I'm visiting are running every single time I use it.)
So I recommend it and think it's probably fine.  I don't use it only because I'm super paranoid.
Using an exchange only to buy, and them moving the money off of it is good if your own personal security is much better than the exchanges (and how much you trust them).  If you suck at computer security, keeping coins online may indeed be safer for you.  If you're very good at security, you should do it yourself.
I specifically mentioned Coinbase's vault because it's user-friendly and easy to use, while also (theoretically, if it works correctly) not actually having Coinbase hold your money, so you're safe.  It's the best of both worlds, and easy for most users.  Just don't login to it from a public computer!  And run virus scans regularly!

For your android phone, download something called [Mycelium](  Then, before you do anything, open it and go to the menu and hit backup, and follow the instructions.  Write the words it gives you down on paper, *not* on your computer if you can avoid it, and keep that paper someplace safe.  (The reason you don't want it on your computer is so that if you get hacked, it's not on your computer and your Bitcoins are safe.)  As long as you have those words it gave you, you can recover your bitcoins.  No matter how many different addresses you use.
For your computer, download [Electrum](  After you install it, when you run it for the first time, it will also give you some words that you need to write down or otherwise store safely somewhere.  It will also prompt you to make your own password that will be required whenever you want to spend your Bitcoins.  The words it gives you allows anybody to spend your Bitcoins, even without the password, so again I recommend not keeping them on your computer if you can avoid it.  The password is used because Electrum generates your addresses from the words, and saves them on your computer, but it encrypts them with the password, so that way if you're hacked, the hacker still need that password (or just the unencrypted words).
So remember, whichever you choose, save those words!  And make a PIN or password too.  The words allow you to recover your Bitcoins, and the password encrypts the addresses derived from them that are stored on your computer.
Having the words safe and using a password are both necessary to protect your Bitcoins!

Arbitration measures are programmed into the contract though.  All of the possible legal issues and other problems that can occur should be inside the contract already.  That is, you can write the contract such that manipulating the data that is fed into it, or the numerous arbitration methods agreed to, is a more costly task than the fulfillment of the contract.

yes, with digital assets, it's possible to span the spectrum of security.  you can for example post all your passwords onto facebook and twitter, or you can encrypt them and keep them on your computer.  one method is more secure than the other.  big brother is perfectly capable of seizing poorly secured things.  big brother is *not* capable of seizing well-secured things.  i thought it was implicit in my post that i believed my security model to be adequate to prevent big brother's seizures, but in case it wasn't clear, i believe my security model to be adequet to prevent big brother's seizures

@_date: 2015-03-02 17:08:14
Yeah you don't need mycelium or electrum if you are just going to use a paper wallet.  However, for your situation, what would probably work just fine is Coinbase's "vault".  Set up a "vault" account and just keep your bitcoin in there.  It's multisig and done in the browser, so Coinbase can't actually access (and thus can't steal) the funds (without your approval).
That's going to be the most user friendly secure storage for you most likely.
As for your question... a private key is a private key for a single address.  The words are like a master private key from which multiple private keys (and their corresponding addresses) are derived.

@_date: 2015-03-23 03:04:38
You are correct, it's bad thinking.  Proof of Stake and other forms of non-proof-of-work have at the very least some theoretical problems and trust issues, even though so far they don't appear to have been problems for the major POS coins.  Proof of work, for all its faults, means just that -- actual work has to be expended in order to secure the network.  There's just no getting around it.  Without that, a blockchain simply cannot be guaranteed to be secure (at least not in any way we know of yet).  The motives and coercion and any other problems with the people mining don't matter -- if you put in the work, you get the reward, it's just that simple.
And so you need the reward in order to incentivize the work.  The currency is necessary in order to motivate the miners to do the work.  Everything else follows from that basic economic principle:  if the coin has any value, then mining will have some kind of value.  The feedback loop self-fulfilling prophecy of the value of the money emerges from that simple idea.  The whole value of the network -- being an immutable time-stamped ledger -- that value is backed by the work that went into it.  So you can't have that same value without the work, which you can't have without the coin to represent that value.
So yes, for any blockchain to have long term survival, it has to have a currency in it which provides the incentive for the work to be done to secure it.  That's the whole purpose of a blockchain after all -- if I wanted a ledger that wasn't backed by work, I could just go trust somebody.  Proof of work is what allows the ledger to be distributed.  That's the whole point of a blockchain.  So yes of course it must have a currency tied in, to incentivize the work.

you're going to need to contact electsum.  however, it's likely your coins are gone.  a PGP key is an entirely different thing from an electrum master key.  if elecsum allowed you to paste a PGP key and made bitcoin public keys from it, elecsum's algorithm is probably fucked up some how, and it incorrectly derived bitcoin public keys which nobody (including you) have the private keys for.  bitcoin keys cannot be derived from PGP keys, so if the app did that, it did something wrong, which means there are no private keys for those addresses (or at least none that anybody has access to).

if you have to have government tracking or approval like this, mike hearn's zero knowledge proof of passport is the least intrusive way to do it.  imagine going to a border and putting in your chip/fingerprint/whatever and it just gave a binary pass/fail for if you're a citizen with no other info.  similarly, you can implement things like "are you allowed to withdraw from this account" types of things.
of course that will never be implemented because hackers will find a way to spoof or steal keys and people will therefore need recourse, which can't be done with zero knowledge.  so it'll never happen, but it's a nice idea for how to do evil identity tracking in as non-evil a way as possible.

Actually I think programmers will write the contracts, and they will be smart enough to test them for completeness first.
Yes, the contracts will automate the enforcement and implementation.  My argument is simply that if the contract is written properly, that is all that will be required *in all circumstances*.  I'm sure people will write contracts poorly, but it IS theoretically possible to write them well enough to not need outside intervention.  That may not be practical and won't happen in reality, but it is possible.  It's also possible if it is written well that outside intervention is not *possible* let alone necessary.
And I know how contracts work, how smart contracts work, and what lawyers do (paperwork).  You're not thinking broadly enough about the possibilities and implications of a Turing-complete unalterable and unimpeachable, automatically enforced contract.  (Again, I'm not saying such things are *likely* or practical, just that it's *possible* and that such a possibility does theoretically negate the need for arbitration, since arbitration measures, including catch-all-not-otherwise-covered arbitration, should and would be programmed into the contract to begin with, and are thus part of it.)

Third, I also didn't make another aspect of my digital security clear:  I *hide* my stuff well to begin with.  So they don't know, or at least can't prove in court (in order to charge me with contempt of court), that I even have xyz asset to begin with.  That is a part of my security model as well.

In the video, the guy talks about a problem with zerocash being the setup, where you need a large random number to operate on and get the public component of, but nobody can know that number.
From reading the threshold sigs paper that came out recently, it was my understanding that we have a protocol for a group of people to come up with a private key that none of them knows and provide the public component of it, again without anybody knowing the private key.

Exactly.  A vending machine or fast food restaurant or movie theater or any number of places can all accept unconfirmed transactions very happily and just eat the hit on double-spends or other tx's that never get confirmed.  And that will still be much much better than credit card fees.  And if they connect (with TLS/SSL) to even just a half dozen servers they trust, the chance of this eclipse attack is also small enough that they can just eat it.
This whole fear mongering about unconfirmed transactions is BS.  Yes, they are indeed far FAR less secure than confirmed transactions.  But even so, they're still secure enough for a lot of situations.

but if they support importing a bip32 master key, you can use that.  the electrum pbkdf for deriving the bip32 seed is the same as bip39 pbkdf except the pre-salt is 'electrum' instead of 'mnemonic'.
it was really shitty of them to not implement the BIP 32/39/44 standard that everybody is using.  their objections to BIP39 are pretty much just aesthetic.

It's a mistake to think that anonymity is not privacy.  A mistake which most people do indeed make.  Privacy is the right to selectively share information with only certain people under certain conditions.  But for that to be possible, you need the ability to *hide* your information from everybody else under all other conditions.  Anonymity is therefore the baseline from which you are *able* to selectively share your information.  Without anonymity there is no possibility for privacy, period.
Anonymity also is necessary for fungibility, as was highlighted with the recent BTC-e drama.  Anonymity is absolutely necessary for a currency to work.  It provides fungibility and privacy.  It is 100% necessary and anybody who tells you otherwise is either mistaken or outright lying to your face.

Well ideally you make a business with a closed bitcoin loop and make calls with your suppliers for fixed bitcoin prices, or agreed upon rate of change, over some long period of time. And you price your goods in fixed btc prices.  This detaches bitcoin from fiat and allows it to actually replace the current system.

they can be somewhat trusted.  if it is a standard tx with appropriate fees and has propagated the network and there's no double spends visible within 10 or 20 seconds, it is exceedingly likely to be mined within a short time frame.
it's just that a confirmation is the first indication of it being rock solid.  it's in a block, a double spend is now very very unlikely since it would have to undo a block now too.
but under appropriate conditions, a zero conf tx can still be like 99% solid, which is probably enough for small purchases.  for example, a vending machine or fast food joint could take zero conf tx's all day long and not even check them and it would probably still be far far cheaper than credit card fees, even with them just straight eating the cost of double spends.

@_date: 2015-02-03 05:05:24


Some do, some don't.  There's three types of validity of tx's:  valid and standard, valid but not standard, and not valid.
Most miners will mine only valid and standard transactions, however if they receive a block that contains a valid but not standard tx, they will still accept that block and mine on top of it.  Maybe 10-15 percent of miners (pulled that number out of my ass) actively mine valid but non-standard transactions.  The Eligius pool, for example, manually altered its rules for what it considers standard, so it mines *some* non-standard transactions but not all, because it's going based on its own rules, and since its blocks are still *valid*, everybody else will accept them when Eligius mines a block that includes them.
Currently, only normal bitcoin addresses, 2-of-3 and 3-of-3 multisig addresses, and OP_RETURN data of 40 bytes or less, and all outputs greater than 546 satoshis, and there is a 0.00001 fee per kilobyte size of the tx -- only tx's that meet that criteria are considered "standard" by the majority of miners.  So any transaction with different scripts other than normal addresses and multisig addresses will be not standard and take much longer to get in a block.  I suspect that if you include a larger than normal fee, there's probably a good chunk of miners with settings set to mine non-standard tx's if they have a good fee -- although I don't know that for sure, I'm just guessing.
As for memory, well that depends on the size of the script.  "1+1+1+1+1=5" is not standard and is much smaller than the script which is standard "Here's 3 public keys listed in their entirety, get two signatures".

I'm not a developer, although I'm teaching myself to program in order to, among other things, try to contribute to development.  And I *do* understand how Bitcoin works at the level of most developers.
Also, the more I read it, the more I think that post may be too confusing.  If thinking in terms of addresses helps you conceptualize better, just keep doing that.  Thinking in terms of from addresses and to addresses is not really going to cause you any troubles or problems.  There's no reason *not* to think about it that way unless you are genuinely interested in learning how Bitcoin works.  If you just want to be able to use Bitcoin, you don't really need to understand that.  Just like you don't need to know TCP or HTML in order to use a browser to browse the internet, so too do you not need to know how Bitcoin works in order to browse Blockchain.info or use wallet software.  I had it in my head you wanted to learn at a technical level how Bitcoin really worked, but that may not be the case.  If you are, [this video]( is pretty hefty good starting place, but you can definitely get through it.
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:29:46
I'm not sure the best way to show it, or where I originally read it.  But it is a mathematical proof.
(In the following, H=1 and T=0)
Imagine a coin that will always land on heads.  It's 100% weighted.  And another coin that is truly 50-50.  If you XOR those two flips together, you will have the possible results of H+T=H or H+H=T, each with a 50% probability.  So the result is a 50-50 even though the one input was always heads.
Now let's weight it so it's 90% heads and 10% tails.
Well 90% of the time, the situation is the same, H+H=T and H+T=H, each with a 50% chance.  But as those outcomes only represent 90% of the possibilities, we know that each of them only happens 0.9\*0.5 = 45% of the time.
The other 10% of the time, the first coin is T, so the results are T+T=T (because 0+0=0), and T+H=H, and each of those outcomes still has a 50% chance, but within the context of already starting at a 10% chance, the overall probability is 0.1\*0.5 = 5% for each.
So when we map out all possibilities of things that can happen, we arrive at the following probabilities and their outcomes:
    45%  H+H = T
    45%  H+T = H
    5%   T+T = T
    5%   T+H = H
That represents 100% of the possible outcomes, and if you add the probabilities together for how often H is the result and how often T is the results, you will get 45+5 = 50% for each, a true 50-50.
From that, we can see that no matter how the first coin is weighted, the XOR result will always be 50-50 because the second coin is fair.  Further, we can then say because we know *that* result is 50-50, if we XOR it with any other coin, we can guarantee that the result of that new operation will *also* be 50-50.
And we extrapolate that forward until we've XOR'd all the coins together and we can now prove that as long as one of them was fair, the final result will be 50-50.
Now we can also extrapolate that out to other types of data.  After all, if a series of 1's and 0's (heads and tails) XOR'd with another series is 1's and 0's is completely fair, then that means that data, represented by 1's and 0's, can also undergo that same transformation, and as long as one of those pieces of data is "truly random", then the XOR'd result is also just as random, as we just showed with the weighted coin flips.  That's why one time pads are known to be secure.  Because the key is completely random, and we can prove mathematically that XORing anything to a truly random key produces a random output.
So that's how and why companies that want true randomness will gather multiple sources of randomness... they'll have their Geiger counter and their cosmic background radiation radio and their noise gatherer and their sha256 and whatever else, and then they'll XOR it all together, and that way, they get the best entropy of all the sources, even if they don't know which source actually has the best entropy.   So whenever you hear somebody talk about combining sources of randomness, that's what they mean, they're just XORing the sources together, because that gives them the best possible randomness.
This feature of XOR is behind all cryptography.  All crypto is just an attempt to simulate a one time pad key with a shorter key and an algorithm, so rather than creating a 1gb key for a 1gb data file, you have a password and the AES algorithm that stretches that password into a "random" key 1gb long, but in a deterministic way that will be reproduced when you input that same password to decrypt it.
That's basically all crypto is.  Figuring out how to make good pseudo-random keys so that the XOR operation output (aka the ciphertext) is as close to random as possible.

What the article is referencing is that in a transaction you don't write the "from address".  You write the transaction number and the output in that transaction.  So the software can go get that transaction and its output and derive the "from address" from that information.  So writing the from address would be a redundant waste of space.
Additionally, because there aren't really addresses, just scripts, it's possible to receive money from something that's just plain and simple *not an address*.  No public key needed, no signature required.  As long as the script validates, you can use that input as money that you can spend.
And the "to address" you eagerly check is a hash of a public key.  Like I said, most Bitcoin software assumes you want to make one type of transaction, so it's designed to make doing that, and only that, easy and intuitive.

Yes, the Electrum 2.0 wallet master public key is simply a BIP32 master public key, and all primary addresses come from m/0/n where n is the index, and all change addresses come from m/1/n.  The master private key is derived in the BIP39 pbkdf manner, except the presalt is 'electrum' instead of 'mnemonic' (and of course, the words/hex does not conform to the BIP39 standard).
All BIP32-based standards usually have the primary and change addresses not hardened, under a hardened parent, usually starting at m/0/0 and m/1/0.  Even BIP44 starts at m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 and m/44'/0'/0'/1/0, so you can use m/44'/0'/0' as your master public key to look up m/0/n and m/1/n.
Most places and wallets haven't yet implemented a watch-bip32 key feature, but some have.  You can go to [bip32.org]( and at the top, select Derive From "BIP32 Key" instead of "Passphrase".  Then paste the xpub master key in the BIP32 Extended Key field.  Then below, under derivation path, select "custom" and in Custom Path put m/0/0 and you'll see your first non-change electrum address.  m/0/1 will be the second.  And so forth.  m/1/0 will be the first change address.
[Blockchain.info]( also will aggregate xpub master keys for you.  Just as you can view an address with the URL:
    
so too can you view a collection of xpub addresses with
    
and it will display all your addresses, m/0/n and m/1/n.  I don't know its gap limit in searching, or if it searches anything other than m/0/n and m/1/n, but it does search at least those two, so if you're looking for a watch-only website, that's probably the easiest.  [Here's an example]( from blockchain.info:
The two addresses 12iNxzdF6KFZ14UyRTYCRuptxkKSSVHzqF  and 1EfgV2Hr5CDjXPavHDpDMjmU33BA2veHy6  both belong to that xpub key (they are m/0/0 and m/0/1), and you can see they are grey/unlinkable just like an address would be if you were on its page.  I couldn't find an example online that used more than just two addresses, but you get the idea.

they work exceedingly well together, it's just that no wallet has made a user-friendly implementation of that exceedingly awesome work.
let's say i want to buy something from you but we dont' trust each other.  we agree on an escrow agent, and make a 2-of-3 multisig with my key, your key, and escrow agent's key.  i then fund the multisig and then make an nlocktime tx from the multisig to pay you in say 2 weeks and give you the signed tx.  now you know i can't get at my money just by myself, and the only way you don't get paid in two weeks is if i and the escrow agent conspire against you to double spend it before those two weeks are up.  so you give me your product, i leave, and then i either do nothing and you get paid in two weeks (or i can send a new tx for sooner), or i find a fault with the product and appeal to the escrow agent.
this could all be done behind the scenes in a wallet where i just scan your address at the point of sale, then select "coinbase" or something from a dropdown list of escrow agents ive imported, since i see underneath your "Bitcoin accepted here" sticker one which reads "proudly using coinbase escrow services".
so all i do is scan your address, select coinbase, and hit send and then the phone app makes the multisig and the nlocktime tx and sends it to you and all that jazz.
and for coinbase's part, they don't even have to know about or get involved in any transactions where they aren't required to be arbiters, so there is zero fee paid to them when you don't need them.  they just put an extra out to themselves as their fee when they make an arbitration ruling by creating and signing a double spend tx.
you could even have a situation where we each have our own agent, and you dont trust my escrow agent and i dont trust yours, so we do the same thing except with a 4-of-6 multisig key, where i have two keys, you have two keys, and our agents each have one key.  so now if i want to appeal to the agents, both of them have to agree i am right in order for the double spend, and neither of them (and not even working together) can steal the money.
yes, bitcoin and escrow work exceedingly well together.  there's just not a user-friendly application for doing it yet.  but it absolutely works just fine.  and without any ability for the escrow agent to unilaterally steal any funds.

If Circle pays enough to de-incentivize that, or if they gain 51% and side-mine and only publish the new chain regularly in order to undo Coinbase transactions, then the confidence in the network goes down and people stop using Bitcoin and start using Litecoin, or whatever else, and Coinbase adds Litecoin support.

Unless they have obligated themselves to some time line, no in fact they don't have an obligation.


Only inasmuch as they have obligated themselves.  For example, those that are paid by the Bitcoin Foundation have a contractual obligation.


No, no it's not.  Not unless that's actually their job.  Otherwise, *it's not their job*.
Open source projects get stopped in the middle all the time, because the devs stop working on it.  They don't owe anybody anything.  If you want it to finish it, you are welcome to, that's why it's open source.

that's not necessary if the address has not been re-used.  the address is a hash, and the hash is quantum-resistant, although i'd be happier if there was a standardized address format for "OP_DUP OP_HASH256 ... OP_EQUALVERIFY" in addition to hash160, so that the hash space was 256 bits instead of 160.  Cutting 256 to 128 isn't really worrisome, but cutting 160 to 80 bits is moderately worrisome for me, and I'd like to be able to use sha256 addresses without manually making them.

Well what exactly do you mean by "unverified" in that sense though?  How is it unverified?  If it's a valid tx and there's no double-spends for it on the network, it's virtually guaranteed to get mined.  A 1-confirmation tx can be undone by a 2-block re-org.  But in the end, a valid tx that has propogated the network and has no double spends against it will almost certainly be put in a block.  People talk about unconfirmed tx's like there's a huge difference in probability -- and although there is a huge technical difference between a tx in the mempool and one in a block, in terms of the probability of the money "being good" and being spendable by the recipient at a later date, unconfirmed tx's are generally fine.  I would consider an unconfirmed tx with no double-spends in the mempool as good as gold.  It's like 99.9% good, and 1 confirmation just moves that to 99.99%.  There's no real functional difference as far as determining the validity of the payment on the receivers side goes.  The tx is valid, so it's gonna get mined.  Accepting unconfirmed tx's for any amount under like ten thousand dollars is almost certainly going to be fine.

@_date: 2015-02-04 04:07:12
it's insecure either way.
it's also possible to write a far better method of secure transfer.  for example, make a rule that insecure old addresses can only be spent if a hash of the spending tx is imbedded in a prior lamport signed tx which contains instructions for the address the insecure funds must be sent to, and the earliest lamport signed tx is the only valid one for an insecure UTXO reference.  then the user wishing to spend his money creates the spending tx, hashes it, creates the lamport tx with the hash and the address he's sending to, and waits until that's confirmed, and then broadcasts his insecure tx.  now nobody can forge it because the lamport tx backing it up is the earliest tx for that insecure UTXO, and thus is the valid one, and no future alterations can be made because the lamport proof tx for it will always be later than the original lamport proof tx.
that obviously has some problems, like if the insecure tx is messed up or something, but even with its problems and potential pitfalls, it's a *far* better solution than "trusted" nodes.

knowing the pool of possible words doesn't matter.
if you flipped a coin 256 times, you'd have a 256-bit key that would be impossible to guess.  the fact that the pool of possibilities for each flip is a known 0 or 1 (or heads/tails) doesn't matter, because each one is randomly chosen.  so even though you know it has to be a 0 or 1, you still don't know which.  the security in that sitautions isn't hiding that you're using a coin, it's hiding the result.  similarly, the pool of words for your seed is fine for everybody to know, just not the exact words from it that make up your seed.
adding a password of your choosing doesn't increase the security very much -- humans are terrible at making passwords.
the reason you bip38 your paper wallets is so that if somebody finds them, they can't immediately just steal your coins.  but the main security there isn't necessarily your password (although a good one would do the trick) -- the main security is the fact that somebody has to find the piece of paper first.  so only a handful of people in the world can even get the bip38 key to begin with, and THEN they have to crack the password.  whereas with your seed or a bitcoin private key, the threat model is that literally every one on earth is using all computing power available at all times to crack your key.
and 12 randomly chosen words from a pool of a few thousand is actually enough possibilities that even with that threat model, you are safe.

Everybody has these fancy theories of what's important in trading, but it's really really simple.  Can you make predictions (and trades) that lead you to making more profit than the market average?

SSSS splits a private key up so you need multiple parts to reconstruct the private key itself.  SSSS doesn't care what you do with that key once you have it, but you need those parts to reconstruct it. And once you've reconstructed it, the key is exposed and shouldn't be used again.
Multisig allows many different private keys to cooperate in order to sign a specific transaction that send a specific amount of money to a specific place, and those same people/keys can be re-used later because the cooperation doesn't leak the keys.

Well there's no "to" addresses either.  The "to" address is simply the last half of a script that runs, which if when run returns "true" allows you to spend the money.
In normal "address" transactions that script is "duplicate the last thing, hash it, check that the hash matches this hash I've given [aka the address], and if it does, go verify that the thing you hashed was a public key and that there's a valid signature with it."
And when you spend it, you provide the tx ID and vout, which provides the last half of the script, and you give it a signature and pubkey for the first part, so the full script that runs is:  "Here's a signature, and here's a public key. Duplicate the last thing [the public key], hash it, check that the hash matches this hash I've given [aka the address], and if it does, go verify that the thing you hashed was a public key and that there's a valid signature with it."
And when that script is run, if the signature is valid for the given public key, and if the given public key hashes to the hash given in that first tx, then the script returns "Success!" (aka OP_TRUE) and the tx is valid.
So yeah, there's no "from" address.  *Because there's no addresses at all.*
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:46:52
Yes, Bitcoin is complicated, and yes, that may be a barrier to entry.  Blockchain.info and indeed most wallets, expect that you want to use only one specific type of script, so the hash part of that script is specifically designated in most Bitcoin software to be labeled as an address.  It creates all the other goblety-gook in the tx and only asks you for the address and it magically does the rest.  And blockchain.info is made specifically to make it look like an address, because that's easier for people to understand.  That's just not what's actually happening behind the scenes.  But if it helps you deal with Bitcoin, great, think of it like that, it won't hurt you (as long as you aren't manually making your own hex transactions).

Yeah, no limit has huge swings, and it also punishes fish worse (losing a bet in limit versus losing your stack for a mistake), so for a cash game, it was not a favorite or pros or fish to play.  That's the same reason PLO is gaining in popularity -- that mistakes cost less and are less easily identifiable, so fish enjoy it more.  Combined with the internet age where people understand and don't mind variance as much, it makes sense that PLO would do well.  And yeah, big bet cash games were still usually pot limit so you couldn't just shove for multiple times the pot and end all play.  Poker gained its surge in popularity with the Chris Moneymaker win happening at the same time as internet forums started to get popular -- so the ability to exchange information and analyze hands with other people, and run a billion hand simulation on your home computer, and then having online where you can play for small amounts any time day or night and then be able to review your hands afterwards and analyze your play in tracking programs -- all that combined meant an explosion of interest in the game as well as a dramatic increase in skill.

Man is the cause of a significant amount of the change.  And you are correct, "people" are on both sides of the "debate."  However, the scientists in that field of study are resoundingly on one side.


Yet another wonderful example for me to try to explain to you the nature of statistics and why you use them incorrectly.  Let's have a hypothetical situation where 40% of scientists are atheists and 60% are religious, but only 0.1% of the general population are atheist and 99.9% are religious.  One could make the argument that "well over half of scientists are religious", but that's not the important statistic there.  The important statistic is that a fuck-ton more scientists are atheists than the general population, and that as you studied science more you got less religious *by a significant margin*.  The reason over half the scientists are religious is that the starting line is 99.9%

if the bank manager and the safe are both bitcoin, that's multisig.

that's an off-chain transaction.  it has nothing to do with bitcoin, other than bitcoin is the type money being deposited.  that's why it's called "off chain" because once it's in the bank's address, nothing is actually happening on the blockchain, you're just using the bank's internal account system, completely independent of bitcoin.

Not quite.  The security of the network depends at least in part on the quantity of miners, who will stop mining if the price is too low.
Additionally, in order to send $500 million in value for example, the market cap has to be at least that.
So there's a lot of upper and lower theoretical thresholds, but you're right in general terms.  That is, the utility and safety of the network are probably roughly similar at a price of $100 or at $5000.  But for the reasons above they definitely *aren't* similar at $1 and $1M.

That's not useful if the embedding pre-dates any knowledge of the source material, otherwise everybody knows it was around before then, and both the timestamping aspect, as well as the copyright/authorship aspect, are functionally useless.
[My method]( is better.  You place the hash in the blockchain, and as part of the source material itself, you include the statement "the author is whoever can sign a message with the key of the sending address in the timestamp tx, and the earliest timestamp is the only valid one".  In that way, you are able to timestamp and copyright the work.  And if you do the timestamp before publishing the source material, you have unequivocal proof that you are the original author.  On top of that, you have a donation/purchasing address that guaranteed belongs to you the author of the material.
Additionally, you can make a namecoin entry for the material and the proof tx and the download location, and any licenses you want to make for the work, all assigned to the same hash160 as the bitcoin sending address (but in namecoin address format).  So now you have a robust licensing and distribution method that also guaranteed (at least by namecoin's blockchain) belongs to you the author.
And again, if you do all that before publishing the source material, you can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are the original author.

As I described in the other reply, it's all just a script, and alt-coins presumably also use scripts, so they theoretically can implement this.  They might not have turned on this functionality though -- for example, their software might say "any script that's not a normal address is automatically invalid", and that's just part of how that coin works.  But there is no technical barrier to them implementing it.
They can also decide to accept new and different scripts.  Namecoin, the first alt coin, added a script that says "I've included some data which is to be assigned to this address, and it is only valid if the same data isn't already assigned to some other addresses, but if that's the case, then this address owns that data for the next 30,000 blocks".  That's a script that runs in Namecoin, and it's how Namecoin can create a distributed DNS and identity system, because its protocol allows you to publish data that "belongs" to you and only you.  And the first implementation was using that data for DNS resolution -- matching domain names to IP addresses.

My point was a remittance *company* has no use for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is only necessary for the company if the company in Place A doesn't trust the company in Place B, so they have to use Bitcoin to prove that they made the transfer.
But if it's all one company and both branches trust each other, they can just keep a spreadsheet and trust each other to pay what is owed at some interval.
So Bitcoin isn't useful for them for that purpose, and it's probably more of a pain in the butt to go USD&gt;btc and then btc&gt;other-fiat, than to just have the local branch have USD on hand and go USD&gt;other-fiat.
So from a business perspective, Bitcoin is only useful when the two branches don't trust each other.  And in that case, they're not really functioning as remittance as much as local Bitcoin exchanges, and then their customers send bitcoin from one exchange to the other and then those customers cash out of that exchange.
Bitcoin as a remittance tool is really only useful for *individuals*, so they can bypass all the companies and banks and associated financial restrictions, bullshit and fees.  So if the *individuals* want to remit money home and are willing to deal with bitcoin or have ways of trading it locally, it's **much** more convenient.
But bitcoin is pretty much useless for a remittance *company*.

I have a half dozen passwords that I use for things that I can't have a password manager for, like my FDE bootup and my password manager itself, and I've never forgotten them.  It's just not any trouble for me to add an entry to my password manager for a new truecrypt drive and stick that on dropbox.  I guess I could write all my memorized passwords down and use secret sharing and give shares to all of my family and friends, so that in the event I did completely lose my memory, I could get it back.  But honestly, I don't have a fortune, and if I am in an accident and completely lose my memory, losing 100% of my digital "stuff" is maybe an extra 1% or 2% worse.  Not enough that I care.  If one day I do have enough that it's a disaster to lose it, I probably will pass out secret shares, but that's just not a concern right now.

Right, because you have to also make sure one party cannot benefit from completing his side of the transaction and not allowing the other to complete, so the risk put up by both parties each individually, has to be greater than the sum total of all funds involved, which in a straight 1:1 fiat for btc trade (or any other 1:1 trade, which would be almost all trades) would be a minimum of 2x put up by each person.  Otherwise one party could screw the other party without loss.

I don't know if there's an easy guide for PGP or not.  Maybe somebody else can help me out here.
If you're on Windows you can download a program called [HashCalc]( and also [Gpg4Win](  Hash calc will give you a file's hash if you just drop the file into the window of the program while it's running, and Gpg4Win will install all of the components necessary to get GnuPG on your computer, as well as a nice GUI.  You'll need to read their documentation on how to use it, and read up on what pgp is if you don't already know, and learn how to import somebody's public key.  You also have to "sign locally" their key with a key you make in order for the GUI to tell you that they have a valid signature.  (If you use the gpg binary on command line, you can read the output and don't need to do that, but the GPA just says good or bad without reason-- and the reason may be that it's a GOOD signature from an "untrusted" source.)
Learning all that might take a little bit, and like I said, I don't know of any quick start guides, but once you learn, you just open up GPA, and open up the sha256sums file in GPA and hit the verify button and it should tell you that it has a good signature.  Then you know that file is valid and the sha256 sums in it are trustworthy, so then you open HashCalc and drop the files in and see if the hashes match up.

Well security is simply the product of (hashrate \* time) since those are the things an attacker would need to use to destabilize the network.  So, assuming the same computing power, 10 one minute blocks would be just as secure 1 ten minute block.
As you pointed out however, the lower confirmation time, the more orphaned blocks and forks and such, so lower confirmation time means more garbage being sent around, so lower confirmation time wastes bandwidth, and if the blockchain doesn't have some pruning mechanism, it wastes computer space as well.  That's presumably why Satoshi settled on 10 minutes-- the happy medium he decided on between confirming things as fast as possible and not clogging up the network.
I personally would prefer 1 minute or hell 15 second blocks and just have something in place to auto-prune and defrag the blockchain every week or something.  Hard drive space and bandwidth are relatively cheap to come by, and faster confirmations gives you at least a *little* bit of a feeling of security right away, whereas bitcoin zero confirmation wait-times make you wait many minutes before you can stop worrying about a double spend.

No, multisig and SSSS are entirely different things.
SSSS is a method of splitting up any type of small amount of data.  A private key can be used, or a password to a file.  Whatever tiny data it is, SSSS allows you to break it into pieces m-of-n of which must be together in order to reconstruct that data.
Multisig comes from how Bitcoin works.  Bitcoin addresses aren't actually addresses, they are scripts, mini programs that execute.
When a Bitcoin is first created, it is "mined" and either comes from the fees or the block reward.  From that point forward, it is simply passed around, moving from one transaction to another.  So when you get a bitcoin, what's actually happening is that a "transaction" is recorded on the blockchain that says the following:
"I own address A, and you can see from tx number X that address A received some bitcoins in an output.  I am spending those bitcoins, using them as inputs for this transaction, and sending them along to this other address, the output of this transaction, which can later be used as an input for a future transaction.  I am proving I am the owner of address A by signing this message with my private key, and you can use my public key and this message and the signature to verify that."
That statement is represented in a specific way, and one of the features of Bitcoin is that "addresses" aren't actually addresses.  As I said above, they are scripts.  So those inputs and outputs that have bitcoins attached to them aren't really addresses.
When an "address" receives money, the money is actually paid to a script, and anybody who can execute the script can spend that money.  Under normal circumstances, the script basically says the following:
"Check that the signature is valid for this transaction and the given public key.  If it's not, the tx is invalid.  If it is, and thus you have proven that you own the private key associated with the public key, and that you approve of this transaction, then go to the next step...  Ok, next step is that we hash the public key that went with the signature.  (A hash is a one-way function that can't be reversed.  So if I give you data, you can easily compute the hash, but if I just give you the hash, you can't go backwards to figure out the input data.)  If the public key does not generate the correct hash, make the tx invalid.  If it does, then we're all good and the tx is valid, since we've proved we own the address, we've proved it's the *right* address, and we've signed the tx."
So that's a "normal" bitcoin transaction, and when you send money to a normal address, you're really just sending money to the statement "whoever can prove they own the key that hashes to this hash can spend the money".  So whoever can satisfy that statement can then spend the money.
A multisig address is just a different statement.  So for example, for a 2-of-3 multisig address, you are sending money to the statement "I've listed three keys here, and if a future transaction spending this money is signed by at least two of them, then allow it."
But many other statements can and have been used.  [There is an "address"]( that corresponds to the statement "True", aka the script always passes and anybody can spend its money.
I could also send money to the statement "write a math operation that equals 5" and you could spend it with the script "2+2+1".
Normal addresses are merely the statement "check the signature and verify that the key provided with the signature matches this hash", but there's a lot of other possible statements.  They are written in [Bitcoin's "Script" language]( which is just a simple and incomplete programming language.
Multisig addresses are a subset of what are called "pay to script hash" (aka P2SH) addresses.  They are called that because in order to save space, rather than writing out a long script, the convention now is to write the script "evaluate the script used when trying to spend this money, and make sure that it verifies and also that it matches the following hash: [hash goes here]".  In bitcoin, that whole statement is assigned to be the byte "05" followed by the hash, which is always 20 bytes long.  And when you convert that 21-byte string that beings with 05 into base58, it always begins with a 3, which is why multisig addresses and all P2SH addresses begin with a 3.  They all say "evaluate the spending script and make sure it matches this hash", and then the spending transaction is the one that actually includes the long script.  So you only have to write it once, in the spending tx, instead of twice (paying script AND spending script), so it saves a little space.  And normal bitcoin addresses begin with a 1 which is assigned to the statement "There is only one key, so check the public key and signature are correct, and make sure they match this hash".
But again, you could write out any statement yourself, and you don't even have to use P2SH addresses to store it, (that's just the nice thing to do).  You could just write it all out in the receiving transaction to begin with.  It would still be a valid tx, but block explorer websites like blockchain.info wouldn't have a good standard way of displaying it, so they'd just say "unable to decode".
So, to summarize, SSSS splits up data, while a multisig address is a special type of script.  They are entirely different things that serve different purposes.

For everybody joking (or not??) about the randomness and saying he should hash it:  what he should actually do is roll two keys, and hash one of them, and then XOR one key with the hash of the other.
The XOR operation gives you the randomness of whichever has the best randomness.
So for example let's say you have 10 coins, and you know nine are slightly weighted but one is truly 50-50, but you don't know which one.  The way to generate a truly 50-50 flip is to flip all the coins, XOR all the results together, and use the result.  So all ten coin flips xor'd together count as one single flip-- but it's guaranteed to be a true 50-50 flip as long as one of the coins is 50-50.

dude.  75% of bitcoin businesses are scams.  you gotta be careful.  you can't just waltz in and think like you do with a credit card, where there's automatic insurance and charge reversals and all that.  this is anonymous cash you are handing to strangers.  they're going to try to steal it.  you have to change how you approach buying goods and services.  like 80% of the people i PM about trades magically stop communicating with me when i mention the word "escrow" but that other 20% actually means business.
the price you pay for freedom is the responsibility to watch out for yourself.  now, obviously, you got scammed, and that sucks, and im not trying to add insult to injury, nor to blame you-- some shithead took advantage of you and THEY are obviously to blame... but i really want to emphasize that you have to completely change how you approach commerce and you always have your wits about you and stick with trusted users/services like you say in your post.  if they don't have a reputation, and they won't send first or use escrow, don't do business with them!!!  if you really want their product or service, but it's a website like that, e-mail them and tell them you want their service but you insist on escrow.  if they're serious about doing business, they'll work with you and do that.

Well the whole point of the kidnapping situation is that it's an end-of-the-world scenario where you cannot lose your kid, even one time.  You should not ever be doing that type of transaction with an anonymous stranger over the internet.  You should be doing transactions you can stand to lose.
You also are forgetting two main points.  The first one is that you are not just blowing up the box to protect yourself, you are protecting others and all future transactions by contributing to a society where scammers cannot profit.  And as that society **proves** to scammers that they will blow up, scammers will simply avoid it.
The second and more important point that you forget is that you can break any transaction up into multiple smaller transactions and only ever risk whatever amount you're comfortable with.  So a 100btc trade can be done simply as one-hundred 1 btc trades, where you never ever risk losing more than your 1 or 2 btc in the box, and of course if you get scammed and blow the box, you aren't going to continue.  So you can always mitigate your risk by breaking the transaction down into as small of increments as you are comfortable potentially destroying.  You don't have to risk 100 btc to do a 100 (or rather 50) btc trade, you only have to risk 1 btc (or less) at a time, if you are willing to simply take a little more time.
Additionally, just because this system is in place doesn't mean you can't choose reliable people to trade with.  The game theory system in place is simply an **incentive** -- a backup, an insurance policy -- to deter scamming.  That doesn't mean you aren't allowed to take OTHER measures as well, like only initiating a trade with a trusted well known person.

it's an update on a ledger.  the ledger is distributed around so everybody has one (a digital copy of it on their computer, which is updated in near real time when they are running the bitcoin client), and conflicting ledgers are settled in a specific way so everybody knows which one is the "real one", and any transactions put in the "fake" one which are still valid transacitons will be put in the real one fairly quickly.  updating the ledger is computationally annoying, so it takes a little bit of time to update it.
the people who update the ledger with new transactions are allowed, because everybody agrees that that's fine and they'll accept that as the real ledger, to add one extra transaction to the ledger that says they get 25 bitcoins for their effort.
so what a bitcoin is is nothing more than an update in the ledger saying "i have a bitcoin and im giving it to somebody else" and then you digitally sign that statement and send it out, and if it's a valid statement with no flaws, and the ledger says that yes in fact you do have a bitcoin you're allowed to spend, then the ledger gets updated with that transaction.  so a "bitcoin" is really just an update in the ledger.  bitcoins are minted by that extra money the ledger caretakers create, and from there, it's just a series of updates.  how many bitcoins you have is nothing more than tallying up the total amount your address should have based on teh most recent ledger update.
a bunch of special math properties make counterfeiting the ledger really hard, as well as making it near impossible for me to forge your signature on a transaction you make.  additionally, one of the weird math properties is that the more people who are trying to update the ledger at the same time, the harder it is to mess with the ledger, so to keep the ledger secure, it's important to have a lot of people always trying to grab whatever transactions they see and update the ledger with them, because the act of doing so helps protect the ledger, by virtue of the weird math properties.  they are willing to do this, at electricity and computing cost to themselves, because we allow them to mint bitcoins as they do it which we all agree they can spend.  additionally, most people when they send a bitcoin, the send 0.999 of a bitcoin and say "whoever puts this transaction in the ledger can have the other 0.001 bitcoins" in order to try to give our transaction priority so it gets updated in the ledger sooner rather than later.  this also is just extra money to give more people that much more of an incentive to keep working on the ledger, which helps keep it secure.
but ya, the amount of "bitcoins" you have is just a number in a official ledger that everybody agrees to abide by.  that's all bitcoin is, is a continuously updated ledger.  each update is called a "block" because it's just a block (aka group) of transactions added to the ledger at the same time.  and part of the verification process is that in that update, it also says "the hash of the ledger before i added this update was xxxx", and since hashes are unique and near impossible to counterfeit, everybody knows that it is updating the correct ledger.  Since every "block" does that, there's an indisputable chain of custody back to the first ever ledger update, which is why the ledger is referred to as the "block-chain".

The point of it is a blockchain without a blockchain, but I don't like their implementation.  I don't like the special verification nodes.
To me, the whole idea of ripple was to find a network circuit between you and somebody else, using localized credits and debits that would permiate the currently online network and update nodes accordingly.  Simple, no central authority, and as long as you had a reasonably large friends list, it should work for small amounts at least, and bigger amounts as the network grew.
There shouldn't even be a need for XRP.  You just have in your client "This friend owes me this much [whatever]" and either he "pays" via another transaction coming through, or at any time the creditor can broadcast that an outside payment has been made, so he and Friend X are all square, and he and his friends all keep that and search the network on occasion to see if that person is online, and this payment ticket simply expires or gets deleted when the person is finally online again or after some arbitrary length of time.
You could even have it integrate with bitcoind in order to verifiably square up local debts, and if your friends have an address linked to their ripple account, you simply keep the transaction record on your computer forever until you friend gets updated.  But that's not even truly necessary.
Remember, it's *supposed* to be a system of IOUs, so "cashing out" those IOUs is nothing more than asking your immediate friend nodes to pay their debt, which can be done outside the program, or inside, if it's integrated with bitcoin or heck even Paypal's API.
If a friend doesn't pay, that doesn't even matter, because you initially set a maximum credit amount with each friend anyway, so they just have their maximum credit allocated and the network won't route through them to make an IOU chain transaction.  And although there will be some initial hits, if everybody only gives new friends 0.10 cents worth of credit, the risk is mitigated, and then you slowly increase that for people you've come to know, or who paid you when you requested nodes settle up, and fairly quickly you get a reliable digital hawala network amongst people who are both your friends AND have proven they settle debts in a timely manner.
After all, that's what Ripple is *supposed to be*, right?  I don't understand the need for a known ledger above and beyond my accounts with my closest friends.  I don't understand the need for XRP.  Where is [this ripple](

this is because everything is exponential.  it is just as hard to go from 1 to 10 as it is from 10 to 100, but if you're sitting at 1, getting to 100 seems impossible, but from your "point of view" it's really only as hard as what you think it would take to get to 20.
the concept of exponential increase and decrease is very difficult for people to grasp, yet it is far more fundamental to life than our normal view of things.  for example, poor people who can't afford a car have to now take the bus and spend a good hour or two more each day on their commute, in addition to having a smaller area within which to search for a job.... which makes it so they can't do many of the things or find many of the jobs that would help get them out of that trap.  it's the old "spend money to make money" slogan, but it's true for time and everything else, in addition to money.  when you're still at Level 2, going up to Level 3 is a 50% difficulty.  When you're sitting at Level 20, going up a notch is only a 5% difficulty.
similarly, having bitcoin go from $100 to $200 is significantly easier than going from $10 to $40 was.

It is also not ideal, although it's better than what we have now.  Fugger made a video explaining the ideal ripple solution which is what I originally meant to refer to.  It is a peer to peer credit and trust system, currently not implemented anywhere.


half the BS is XRP, half is calling it "ripple".  The original Fugger design was a credit and trust based system without the need for intermediate fiat.  You simply extend credit to trusted parties in the form of one or more of the things being exchanged.  It was direct peer to peer smart contracts.  The most similar form currently is Open Transactions, although that still requires a server to manage everything.  It is my hope that eventually something like OT will merge with something like BitMessage, and it will be serverless and p2p, and because it's trust-based, no blockchain will be required-- you simply keep a local "blockchain" of contracts between you and others.  Some backup and redundancy will be required for stability, and nodes can operate in "collect all" server mode, but it will be what the entire purpose of it is... *peer to peer*.
If the Ripple company really wanted to make a real "ripple" they would have designed something like that and then just created an alt-coin or colored-coin called "Dollarcoin" which they agree to buy and sell for $1 worth of bitcoin at whatever the current price was.  Heck they could even buy for 98 cents and sell for $1.02 or something.  As long as it was consistent and allowed users to hold fiat-backed (ok semi-backed).  Then they would have opened up a node on a decentralized and open source peer to peer actual RIPPLE setup and began trading on comission.  There's no reason ripple can't include one party saying "sure I'll extend you a loan of $5, but we're marking down that you owe me $5.50".  If they wanted money, they could position themselves as a trusted node for beginners and just charged a fee.  At least they would have laid the framework for that type of system.
If they actually wanted a real ripple exchange...
The framework for a decentralized ripple exchange for any and all digital goods is already in place and available.  All it needs to to be implemented.  Instead, they made a knock-off that REQUIRED you to use them and their fiat *no matter what you were exchanging*.  So their fiat simply (and obviously...) became a floating point against other currencies.  In short.... they made an alt-coin.  Except they made it fiat and they called it Ripple.  It is simply a lie.  It bears no relationship to the real ripple.  It is centralized.  It requires you to use fiat no matter what you're exchanging.  It's a completely unnecessary middleman facilitating trades-- exactly the OPPOSITE of the *entire purpose* of the original ripple idea.

Yes it's easy to do, but generally not recommended. Aside from the privacy issues, each time you use an address, it theoretically gives out a small amount of info on the private key, making it easier to crack. This is a super duper small worry, but it's worth pointing out.

You have a lot of misguided views about what bitcoin was designed to be.  Perhaps you should read the white paper and Satoshi's old posts.  Fees were not a flaw.  There were necessary to make the entire system work.  You see, there's this thing called INCENTIVE, which keeps even untrustworthy people HONEST, and without it, the network would be flooded with DISHONEST people, and the ENTIRE SYSTEM would not work.


Of course you can do small transactions.  You have to *pay a fee* to do it, in order to incentivize miners.


Then go mine.  That's the purpose of bitcoin is that it's *democratic*.
You have a BIG problem of projecting what you WANT and what you think bitcoin SHOULD be, and you're projecting that onto what you actually *think it is*.  And it's NOT what you think it is, because you are projecting.
Bitcoin is what it is.  No more no less.  *It's not what you or anybody else WANT it to be*.  It simply is what it is.  It doesn't owe you to be what you want it to be.  If you don't like it, buy an ASIC and start mining!  Or go make your own alt coin.  If you want other people to use *their* computing power to protect *your* money, you're going to have to pay them for their work.  That's life, you're gonna have to learn to deal with it.

First and foremost, I want to get my money out of banks and in something I believe in and control.  I do not wish to support many aspects of the finance and government controls over my privacy and my money and my ability to use my money as I see fit.  I want complete control over my money.
Secondly, I do think bitcoin is a good investment.  Not just for its deflationary nature, but also because I genuinely believe in it and in other people realizing how useful it is, and I think it will continue to grow immensely over the next decade.  Minor or even major swings simply don't bother me as much as they do most other people.  I'm a professional poker player and I know what playing for the long term means.  And even accounting for the over 80% drop in value in a 48 hour window last April-- but for the month of April, beginning to end, bitcoin was still up 35%, including that crash.
I know people believe in bitcoin, and when panic sells happen, I trust the market to normalize because I know that so many people like myself understand bitcoin and believe in bitcoin.  I also have watched a few different start-ups materialize, and I know how variance-laden new ventures can be.  Bitcoin may swing down to $40 or lower, it may swing up to $500 or higher, but over the next decade, it will show steady growth as people and businesses begin to understand and adopt it.
For those reasons-- as an investment, and as my own personal middle finger to "the man" -- bitcoin was simply the clear choice of where to keep my money.  If it tanks, it tanks.  If it fails, it fails.  For better or for worse, I put my money where my values lie and in what I believe in.  And I believe in Bitcoin.

It's hard not to be mean when the question that's being asked has already been asked and the answer is sitting on the front page of or in the sidebar.  It's also hard not to be mean when people who don't understand how it works start making assumptions based on their lack of knowledge.  "I don't understand what the blockchain is; therefore, bitcoin is insecure. How all of you can be so comfortable when bitcoin is so insecure?" or "I completely ignore the fact that early adopters in any startup venture do well if that venture succeeds, and I also don't know what a ponzi scheme is; therefore bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. Why are you guys dumping money into such an obvious ponzi scheme?"  I'm sorry, but when the questions are basically like that, there's just no kind way to answer.

digital signatures and hashes are "one way functions".  this means that you can verify that something, like the text of a transaction, has not been altered.  take a very simple example and say the "hash" of the text "10+1"  is 11.  if i change the text at all, the hash value changes as well.  and while my simple example may not show it, it is near impossible to go the other direction and figure out what my text originally was if you just are given the hash value 11.  you don't know if my text was "10+1" or "11x1" or "8+3" or "100-89" or whatever.  but if i give you 11, and then later give you "10+1" you can verify that they match up.
i used text that was math in order to get the point across in a simple way, but that's completely inaccurate with regards to what's actually happening-- the reality is hashes are much different types of transformations, and many MANY of them, so even a slight change of the input creates an entirely different hash, and it is basically impossible, as i said earlier, to derive what the input is if you are given a hash value.  it's also basically impossible to create a new input that happens to have the same hash value output.
so ya, the short answer is it's very easy to verify that text is what it should be, and you can know if it's been altered.  and miners don't accept altered (forged) transactions.  there was a transaction made years ago for like a billion bitcoins that went and floated around the network, but it never got in a block because it wasn't a valid transaction and miners just threw it away.

like almost all other options, that's something you can manually change-- it's just a default setting.  you can go into your config file (or run with the --option) and set it to be bigger.  the variable to change is "blockmaxsize" and whatever numbers you enter is assumed to be in bytes. so its current default setting is 1048576 (aka 1 megabyte).
gavin bless his soul is making the satoshi client almost completely configurable so that the power truly does lie with the people.  all these settings and "hard-coded" things people bitch and moan about truly are configurable settings, so if the community really does decide he's wrong about something, they can go in and change the settings.  you want to relay dust and put dust in blocks?  done, you can.  most people won't, but it IS available to do in the client, and you can mine yourself or convince other miners to include dust.
the only hard coded rule that isn't configurable is that "all valid blocks are accepted into the blockchain".  everything else is configurable.  the minimum tx fee, and dust, and block size restrictions and all that-- that is all up to the users to enforce or not.  most of them do, because they agree with gavin for the most part, but you CAN change it, and if you really think something is bad, go convince a pool operater that it's bad and get the network to start mining the "good" way.
obviously, changing the block size would cause a fork since most clients don't accept larger blocks, so you'd have to convince a LOT of people to do it, so the community at large would agree to do it, but the important thing to remember is that it IS democratic and it CAN be changed.  there's already a few dozen hard forks of the bitcoin chain with people doing exactly that type of thing-- implementing changes they think are better.
bitcoin is flexible.  the only reason most things are stuck they way they are is because the userbase genuinely thinks that's best.  if you want to convince them otherwise, go for it.

It's not bad press. It's that people consider being able to move one's own money a crime. Like it or not, Bitcoin will always be associated with things like LR- because it *is* like them... Only better. It is up to we who use it to explain to the outsiders not how Bitcoin is not related to money laundering - it is - but to explain that money laundering is nothing more than being able to use your own goddamn money.
I'm a pro poker player and in a rare circumstance, I happened to not have USD on hand today, so I went to the only open bank to withdraw a few grand in order to go do my job, but they had a limit of 500 and I couldn't get any more. I would have had to pay exorbitant fees at the casino just to even get at my own money.

why the hell are we even talking about smaller fractions!?  i never understood this.  what circumstance is there where we're reading people an address over the phone?  oh we're not? we're using QR codes or copy/paste?  then why aren't we just scanning/copying/pasting the decimal amounts for the transaction!!??  the amount isn't important-- a computer doesn't care.  oh but it's the *psychology" of it you cry.  well let me break it down-- nobody who understands the underlying core of bitcoin gives a flying fuck where the decimal is.  and all the people who don't understand and want to get in anyway are already out of their comfort zone, so decimal places aren't adding much to their discomfort.  and the moment anybody says "gee that's too much for a single unit" literally everybody around them reassures them "oh no don't worry, it's divisible to 8 decimal places, and you can buy any small fraction of one, the decimal is actually pretty arbitrary."
there's literally no circumstance where it makes sense to start adding even more lexicon to the already confused populace of people interested in bitcoin.  if you care about calling things something, you should rally for calling the protocol, the unit of money, and the satoshi software client three different things, instead of all the same name.  by far, that confuses people waaaay more.

Hidden services popped up as an extension of the original Tor function of anonymously re-routing the clearnet.  Tor was designed to be a unbreakable proxy, and its design happened to allow hidden services.  I2P on the other hand was designed from the ground up to actually be an efficient anonymous dark web.  That's why there's so many more eepsites and services-- because it works better and it works faster.  Because it was built that way from the beginning.  You connect to many nodes and become part of a large mesh network.  Tor you go from hop to hop to hop, and so it's ssllloooowww.  Tor was designed with anonymity in mind and nothing else.  Hidden services just happened to be possible on the way it was designed.  But I2P was *built* specifically FOR hidden services.  Once you let I2P connect for a few minutes, eepsites load and relay just as fast as your regular internet.  That's why there's torrent trackers on I2P but not on Tor.  That's why I2P scales and can replace the internet.  Tor can only anonymize *on top of* the internet.

Would that be necessary though?  My understanding was that any likely edge the NSA has on ECC is simply reducing the search space, and thus as long as you got a big enough key to overcome that, you're fine.  Just as how 256 bit keys are never going to be brute-forced, I kind of feel like if we moved to 512 ECC, that that would be big enough for the life of bitcoin.  That is, it's NOT a stepping stone that will need to be replaced again later-- it's a good enough upgrade to be permanent.
It's only necessary because we are less confident in the security of ECC keys, so we just need to have a longer standard default.  But beyond compensating for that, any more is not necessary.

This is essentially the same argument for somebody posting an ex-girlfriend's pictures up on facebook or something.  The GF can remove it but people will have already downloaded it.  The question at hand is "Is the technology useful enough and provide enough good to compensate for the fact that it can also be used for bad?"  And in the case of anti-cnesorship tools, it is my view that they are very necessary and that ensuring free speech trumps the fact that they can be used for evil.
Tor is, in the public eye, synonymous with all kinds of evil-- child porn, assassinations, human experiments, etc. etc. etc. and yet, I would never vote to get rid of it, because the reason those evils are able to exist is because complete and uncensorable free speech is able to exist.  And I would much rather live in a free world where I have to fight evil and teach my children to be good and decent people in the face of evil, than to live in tyranny.  The right to express myself, *and the right for me to read/see/hear the expressions of others*, are fundamental to human discourse and the progress of mankind.
Much evil comes with this-- child porn being the poster child.  But as I said before, freedom is ugly.  Freedom is NOT peace.  But it is still necessary to make the world a better place, even with its evils.  You may get people's personal info and ex-gf's pics, and even child porn and assassination markets, but you also get wikileaks, bitcoin, kickstarter, uncensored internet for China, and so forth.
When you enforce censorship, even for good reason, you necessarily also censor things that should have the right to be open.  It is much better to raise your children and teach society to be good and decent and to live free, than to live in censorship from what others tell you is bad for you.
You may see unedditreddit as a tool that invades privacy of people who's info was maliciously given out, but I see it as a way to ensure the propagation of wrongfully shadow-banned content, as an insurance against abuse of authority.

@_date: 2013-06-01 19:12:53
i would add that utilizing full disk encryption would be wise, as well as taking the time to learn to use and write tasks for tasker is very worth while and can immensely increase your security.  for example, i have all my TIbackups and nandroid backups encrypted and backed up on my dropbox, and i have full disk encryption (with a longer password than the lock pin).  so if i lose my phone, i can text it a command which grabs its location, takes a few pictures and a 10 second video from the front facing camera, and uploads that info to drop box, and another command that has the phone shut down.  additionally the phone shuts down after the second incorrect pin entry.  so if i lose my phone, ya there's less of a chance i'll get it back because i'll likely tell it to power off, but because of that and its full disk encryption, i know my data (and bitcoins!) is much less likely to be compromised.
i also have ADB turned off whenever the phone is locked.  that's actually a BIG one that i forgot to mention.  rooted users usually have adb enabled.  it doesn't matter if your phone is locked or encrypted if it's stolen and it's on and they can just ADB right into it and copy the files to their computer.  do yourself a favor and set that up via tasker or spend the extra dollar on [this]( key for automatic toggle with [ADB Toggle](  phone being locked means jack shit if adb is on.
and encryption!  for the love of god full disk encryption!  adb off does no good if they can just flash a recovery, make a nandroid backup, and then steal the wallet files from there, or just adb into the phone from recovery!
make your phone safe yo!

@_date: 2013-11-08 10:42:08
to unlock your password manager, an attacker needs to guess the password to your password manager.  if it doesn't succeed, he tosses it and tries again.
for a bitcoin brain wallet, he guesses, stores the guess, and then any time in the future ANYBODY uses it, he gets it.
so he gets all wallets at every point in time everywhere at the same cost as just the one guess for your password manager.
so yeah, password managers are safer than brain wallets, for a variety of reasons, the first and foremost being it should be difficult for an attacker to even get ahold of a copy of the encrypted file that is your password manager to begin with.
bitcoin brain wallets are like password protected files that EVERYBODY has a copy of and is ALWAYS trying to hack.
password managers OTOH are things that can only be hacked once hackers get ahold of them.
your password manager is protected both by its password AND the fact nobody has a copy of the file.  bitcoin brainwallets are ONLY protected by your password, and *everybody* is constantly trying to hack them.  brain wallet passphrases need to be strong.
@_date: 2013-02-28 11:02:21
yes.  the "addresses" in your wallet are one part of a two-part key, the second part of which is stored inside your wallet file.  That's the part that tells the bitcoin network that you really do own that address and are allowed to spend its money.  You can export it-- it's called a "private key"-- and either save it somewhere or add that key to another wallet or whatever.  but if you lose your wallet (or forget the password) and haven't put that key elsewhere, the money stays in limbo.  (Obviously exporting the private key has security risks, but I felt I should mention that it's possible.)
this means you can have the SAME address in multiple places/wallets, all with different passwords.  i have an address on my phone with "spending money" which is protected by a 4 digit pin.  That same address is also on my home computer wallet, which has that address as well as other addresses with my bulk funds, which is all protected by a much more difficult password, and which is backed up in the cloud.

i think i understand.  but it requires that the borrower be trustworthy which also implies that the bank has been smart in making a loan with rates and time-frames that the borrower can almost certainly meet.  if the bank is stupid OR the borrower is not trustworthy, it's a HUGE hit, because making a little bit of interest gets wiped out a hundred-fold when somebody defaults on their entire principle balance.  it's a very fine line to walk, but i can see your point and see how it could theoretically be useful and stimulate the economy.  and i understand that it doesn't *necessarily* by its nature have to fail, as the OP video seems to imply.

Pretty far.  Like I said, I hold grudges.  Often to my detriment.  It's a rather large personality flaw, I freely admit.  A scorched-earth policy has been really bad on the occasions I've flown into a rage and done it.  By no means am I super excited about any of this.  I'm just letting you know that I do have the flaw, and I would get pissed enough to harm you even if it harmed me more.  I fully understand the effort it would take to spend time to go to the East Coast and find you, and the complete change in my life that would force upon me.  Take that for what you will, make fun of me for it, do whatever you need to do.  I'm just giving you advanced notice on how my mind works and what my flaws are, since that might affect you.
Edit: and remember by the way, that you were the one who started stalking me here.  I left you alone.  And my bot only replied to you when you replied to me.  I never found you in other threads.  I was and still am happy to let us go our separate ways.

This is why even though it's a pain I always check the hash list file and verify its integrity with gavin's code signing key.  Fucking up my bitcoin client is a DISASTER.  So every time I upgrade, I dutifully go through the steps to verify it.
Edit: key and chain of custody proof.
You can download Gavin's code signing key [here]( which will give you a key 0x1FC730C1 with fingerprint 2664 6D99 CBAE C9B8 1982  EF60 29D9 EE6B 1FC7 30C1.  If you update the key from various pgp key servers, you will see that it has been signed by gavin's old personal pgp key (0xBE38D3A8), which Gavin has proved he owns by posting it on the bitcoin forums [here](  So unless bitcoin.org and gavin's forum account have been compromised, the chain of custody is solid.  Then you just go to the [sourceforge page]( and look at one of the two shasums files.  If you are on Windows, a simple program like [hash calc]( will do the trick of hashing files just fine.  Now you can verify the file hashes and the integrity of the shasums files.

The first rule of every bitcoin transaction with people you don't know is USE ESCROW.  Paypal didn't save save them, using a 3rd party intermediary (which in this case happened to be paypal) is what saved them.  This could just as easily been done with multi-signature transactions or key splitting vis-a-vis Casascius's Bitcoin Utility escrow function.

I got lucky.  I got fed up with Full Tilt's BS customer service and cashed out a week before the shit went down.  I actually had Stars open, and was about to deposit, when everything happened.  On Black Friday, all my money was sitting right in my bank account.  It was about $5k and it was 90% of my net worth.  I would have been in deep shit.

I found out about bitcoin on April 15th 2011.  I know it's that date because that's the day the DOJ shut down online poker in the USA, which was my only source of income at the time.  I had about $5000 to my name, and the vast majority of it had been sitting on Full Tilt, but I had withdraw it the previous week because their shitty support pissed me off.  So on Black Friday as it's called in the USA online poker world, I simply luck-sacked my way into not being completely fucked, having my money sitting in my bank account that day just by sheer random ass luck.  (Thanks FTP shitty support!!!!)  Full Tilt money has to this day not been returned to US players yet.
After binking the avoid-being-broke gutshot, I immediately thought "ok well obviously I'm going to get around this" and started looking up VPNs and money laundering and PMing various people on various forums about photoshopping utility bills and what-not.  In my search for money laundering information, I eventually stumbled onto bitcoin, and although I didn't understand it, it seemed promising.  So I spent all day Saturday-- literally all of the next day -- doing nothing but reading up on cryptography and economics and making it my mission to actually understand how bitcoin worked.  I'm computer literate, but not a programmer and didn't have much knowledge about crypto at the time, and I certainly hadn't put much thought into economic theory.
After about 8 hours of time spent researching, sitting for 20 minutes thinking, more researching, looking up the answers to all my concerns, more research, and more thinking, I finally understood how bitcoin worked.  I didn't understand all the other prospective uses for the blockchain and distributed database technology, but I understood the bitcoin transferring use.  And as soon as I understood it, and I knew how it worked, and I was satisfied that it was actually secure, I had a giant "ah ha!" moment where it was *immediately apparent* that this was the next biggest thing ever and would have to take over the world.  It simply made transacting on the internet too easy.  I immediately saw things like tipping for youtube videos and small businesses being able to take international orders without the giant overhead banks or cards would charge-- all of the places where current payment systems sucked were exactly where Bitcoin shined.
I found out about Bitcoin on the night of April 15th, and I was registered on the bitcointalk forums (though they weren't bitcoin*talk* at that time) on April 17th.  I still didn't know how to get any, but I downloaded the client and let it get the whole blockchain, and then I sent like $12 to MagicalTux on Paypal and just asked him in the memo for however many bitcoins that would get me and pasted my address.  Bless his heart he sent me some!  Bitcoins were right around a dollar then, although they were climbing up to 2-5 fairly quickly.
I went onto the freenode IRC channel and managed to pick up some more before they got really expensive.  A few people while they wouldn't take paypal any more let me do bank transfers to them, and by the end of the week, I had aquired about 1000 bitcoins for prices between $1.50 and $3.00.  I didn't mind this actually because the price was like a dollar the previous week and so I figured I was gonna double the money anyway!  Bitcoin stayed around $5 for a while, which was good, and then started going up to the $10-$15 range and stayed there for a bit.
I had been playing live 1-2 on a very short bankroll (I live in Las Vegas), and while I was doing OK, I still also had to pay my rent and bills, so I had signed up to deal at the World Series of Poker.  I had also sold off some bitcoins as it was climbing into the double digits in order to have more poker money on hand, as well as cash out in order to pay some people for aspects of getting myself set backup online.  I paid a guy $500 for a scan of his utility bill and bank statement with his info blacked out, paid another guy for a scan of his driver's license, and paid somebody else to photoshop all that with the info I required-- so now I could pass the Pokerstars identity verification so it looked like I lived in another country.  Then I found a small mom-and-pop VPN provider and got a dedicated static IP, and configured my firewall to block non-VPN traffic for the poker software.  Finally I traded some bitcoins for ukash to deposit, and just like that I was back online!
I also played on a now defunct site called betco.in which had meh software but by god it worked!  I even beat sethsethseth out of 50 bitcoins in an HU match.
With the cashing out and paying bills and all that, I only had about 700 bitcoins of the thousand I originally bought by the time the World Series rolled around.  The day of the MtGox hack, I was watching price quotes on my phone during breaks inbetween downs, and I was freaking out.  The price went from like $12 to over $25.  I had like $15,000.  That was the most money I'd ever had.  Then I looked again later and it was at like $2 and then the app stopped working.  My stomach sank and I didn't know what to do.  MtGox fixed everything and rolled back internal transactions from the hack and finally the price stabilized, but it stabilized around $12, and I cashed out everything I had, because I realized I was in over my head in terms of knowing what bitcoin would be worth.  I knew it was hot shit, but I knew other people might not, and it was clearly volatile and nobody knew what it was worth.
After a few weeks of thinking and considering, I decided that bitcoin still really was hot shit, and I bought back in, but not nearly as much.  I wanted to support it, but I also couldn't stomach too much exposure to it.  The price then made a slow fall from $15 to $2 and I cashed out a good chunk along the way thinking the MtGox hack killed Bitcoin for good.  As good as it was, there would never be any faith in it.  But by god it refused to die, and it slowly started rising again, settling around $4 or $5 in early 2012.  So I bought some more, but not a lot, again, because I was afraid.  Then I sort of forgot about it because I was playing a lot of mid and high stakes poker with friends who after Black Friday had also gotten fucked over, and so we pooled what little money we had and teamed up, so we could play higher stakes, now that we were all feeding off of a larger bankroll.  It took some time, but I did more thinking and more research, and finally got myself comfortable with bitcoin's volatility.  I had faith in its software, in the power of the protocol and the cryptography behind it, and I realized that the volatility was just because it was something new, and that it really was as amazing as I originally thought, and the world would catch up eventually.  So I decided I was going to hold, spend some when I could-- not cash out, but *spend* it to support the bitcoin system, and wait for the rest of the world to catch up.  I continued being interested in it, and things like Mike Hearn's London talk only made me firmer in my conviction, but I stopped watching the price as much.
In late 2012, my poker team fell apart, and I had about $13,000 plus my bitcoins.  I was very distraught about the team breaking up, and I was playing poker poorly due to tilt over that and some other major life issues that had come up.
Then around Februrary of this year, I sort of got my act back together, and started playing well and trying to take better care of myself, and decided I genuinely believed in bitcoin, so I dumped my few thousand back into it, and started playing mostly online again.
The April downswing wasn't fun -- I lost like 80% of my net worth within a 48 hour window -- but on the other hand, I'd seen this shit before, and bitcoin had survived, and I knew it would survive again, and the $110 price it eventually settled back at after the flash crash was still higher than it had been the previous month.  It was like $15 in January for fuck's sake, so this "crash" was still part of a giant upward trend.  As stomach-wrenching as the April crash was, it actually reenforced my view that bitcoin would win in the end.
So with all my buying and selling, now I only have about 120 bitcoins, and my USD net worth is in the 6 figures, which is an order of magnitude bigger than it's ever been.  I have about $4000 USD cash on hand, which I'm using to play 1-2 live poker in an attempt to break even with my rent and bills, just so I don't' have to cash out any more bitcoins.  I would have loved to buy more bitcoins in these last crashes this past week or two, but all my money's already IN bitcoin!
So that's where I'm at.  Take it for what it's worth.  I do think about the fact that I did at one point have over a thousand bitcoins at one point, but one thing poker is really good at hammering into you is that you can't worry about the past, all you can do is focus on what's in your control and make the best moves you can in the present.

Actually, I think the protocol would be reasonably useful for banks.  They re-design it so money can be centrally printed only from a specific computer or a PGP key or something like that, and that the issuer can also send out a broadcast to reduce all holdings by some percentage, so it can inflate or deflate at will, and it's centrally issued-- and presumably it would follow the rises and falls of the dollar.  Then it's just an internal bank protocol, and replaces their current internal electronic transfers, and is more secure.  They could even offer a secondary currency in the protocol that are just coupons for the bank or something as incentive for bank customers to mine at home and protect their network.  I could see banks utilizing the bitcoin protocol internally like that.  They probably won't since it's not *that* much improvement over what they have now-- bitcoin's value stems from it's *vast* improvement for consumers from what banks offer, but for banks themselves, they certainly don't need it..

You can also use Casascius's bitcoin utility to multiply private keys together to create an escrow address that you can send to in order to prove you don't have the money, but which neither of you can unlock until one sends the other his private key.  You both can verify the public address, but neither of you have its corresponding private key.
This way, you can PROVE that you can't access the funds any more, so you have no reason to screw him over, and then you can pick up the goods and then e-mail him your private key afterwards.

Maybe, but maybe not.  It might actually give them a giant warning or something.  It is US law that gift cards can only be purchased with cash, specifically to prevent money laundering, since once something is in cash form, it's anonymous.  So like if you could buy gift cards with a stolen credit card, you could then just sell them for cash, and voila, easy money laundering that ends with untracable cash.  Therefore AML laws are in place to make sure gift cards can only be purchased with cash.

Why does the MTA think it works though? I assume there is historical data..? And even so, is there some model which gives a possible explanation as to *why* it works? I'm skeptical because I see no logical reason why a trick of mathematics should be useful in predicting a market, and statistically, the authorities you listed don't actually perform better than the market average when your aggregate their results. Additionally, i'm a professional gambler and know a lot of people who think they have edge in scenarios where they clearly don't, so unless I see evidence that makes logical sense as to WHY it should work, I'll be skeptical. I'm not saying you're wrong or anything, i'm just trying to be clear about why i'm skeptical.

Yes, if you want uninsured untracable irreversable money from somebody, they are going to want information about you.  You can get upset about that, or you can use in person transfers.  Yes, there will be higher cost because they have to go out of the way to meet you and they are also making it easier for you to circumvent rules and commit potential money laundering.  This is simply the nature of business.  If you want a service, you're going to have to pay for it, one way or another.  I think providing my ID is a lower cost, especially since you can just mix your coins later.  But ya, until bitcoin is more commonly used and accepted everywhere, it's going to be more of a pain to get it.  You can accept that or you can complain about it.

False.  Https URLs are not crawled because they are not visible, they are encrypted, and instawallet does not link to wallets obviously.  Google only "crawls" whatever URL they hit when they visit the main domain redirect.  In order to get https URLs, extensions or other things would have to leak them.

But for the other 95% of the world that isn't so technilogically minded, or for people who deal with physical objects, the force of the almighty world governments is not avoidable.  So having a government which is favorable to bitcoin is useful, and good news for all bitcoiners, whether or not you personally will choose to utilize it.

This is HIGHLY irresonsible of you to post the readme, espeically with the "This is a maintenance release to fix a critical bug; we urge all users to upgrade."
This is a TEST release.  A *release* ***candidate***.  Normal users should NOT be upgrading to it.  Experienced users willing to test new potentially bad software should test it.  That's why it's in a folder called TEST and hasn't been announced anywhere.
Posting it as if it's an upgrade ready for wide-scale use is very VERY bad and could potentially do damage to a lot of lay-users who don't know any better.

Major hacks will continue to happen.  There's a lot of early early adopters with 5 figure amounts of bitcoins, and honestly it doesn't matter what protections they take, because for millions of dollars worth, thieves will do stake-outs and install hidden cameras and find out how to access them.
And the PSEUDO anonymity of bitcoin has a lot of them fooled into thinking their IRL identities won't be found.  For example, just as a test, it took me 10 minutes on blockchain.info and google to find out who that guy was.  All I had to start with was his reddit account that had a [bitcoin tipping bot address]( which I knew because the bot [shows the verified transactions](  I just go back and back from addresses that deposited to it, and you could say "oh but those might be somebody else" except a lot of them are linked together via other transactions, and then when you go back far enough and you see addresses that are getting money from other addresses in transactions that look very much like really terrible laundering attempts.  like 180.5834 btc to one address and 0.5 btc to another address.  Gee I wonder which address was the change address?
You go back -- still only using transactions where you can clearly tell which address is the change address for the sender, and you arrive at a [very plausible account]( for somebody calling themselves "bitcoin billionaire".  An address that [happens to be registered]( on  which also has registered [a pgp key]( for an e-mail address that clearly comes from a personal website.
Some quick googling and knowing the nickname used on  allows me to find out exactly who this person is, and see that he's [a VIP member]( on the bitcoin forums, which is enough circumstantial evidence for me to be pretty sure that he's the right guy, and his reddit username is enough to convince me that he does have a large stash of bitcoins.  Maybe not all 77K of them, but still probably a lot.
If I'm a theif, I think I've found myself a VERY good target to stake out...  I may be wrong, after all, all of my research is circumstancial guesswork, but there's a good enough chance I'm right, that finding the owner of a 77000 bitcoin address (that's over $8 million) is worth looking into.

That's flawed logic.  Either the investment is a good one, in which case you should put your money into it, or it's not, and you should not put money into it.  And either you are capable enough at predicting market swings to do better than the value of the investment, or you are not.  Or in gambling terms, spreading out your bets doesn't change the house edge, it just lessens your variance.  Either it's a good gamble or it's not.  The only reason to not buy/sell when you think it's the right move to do so, is to lessen variance/risk -- but that generally comes at a cost of having a lower [EV]( overall.  In short, by "insulating yourself from daily swings" you also reduce your ability to capitalize on big moves that favor you and would have gotten you a large profit.
It's all about risk versus reward.  If you can handle the swings, being very aggressive with your money whenever you have an edge is the correct strategy.

Yes, and now if they dispute it, you can show the pgp message to an arbitrator and thus prove that the address you sent to was their address, because you have this pgp signed message, signed by them, that says send money to that address.  So then you can show the transaction with money being sent to that address from an address that you can prove you own by signing something with it.

you can look at individual cities and similar small-area regions and sort by political leanings or what percentage of the population has private insurance, and so on.  while you are right that there are no large scale places (i.e. countries) with completely free market systems, there are small-scale approximations in libertarian-dense areas.  that of course, is still not really all that close, but then, with no data at all to support the claim, there's not really any basis to claim that it would be better than the best that we do have data on.  do you have examples of *any* free market systems in comparison with similar socialized systems?  free markets look OK on paper, but the classic arguments against them have not been well-refuted.

Bitoin ***IS*** backed by something physical.  It's backed by the fact that it is the commodity on which the bitcoin payment protocol operates.  You can move the financial value of *anything* with the bitcoin protocol, across the world to anybody, for near zero fees, almost instantly.  That has value.  So as long as people wish to be able to do that, then bitcoins themselves will continue to have value, as the means by which that mechanism operates.

Is this a joke!?  No domain "exists".  They are human readable representations that are easier to remember than IP addresses.  DNS servers are just places that store info that correlate the "domain name" to the IP address.  You can set up your own DNS server if you want and only ever use that.  Namecoin DNS is just as valid as any other DNS, and it's even better because it's resistant to censorship and being taken down.  It has a lot of flaws, and a blockchain isn't the most efficient, but it's certainly valid for goodness sake.

Actually that's not true.
It is true that I cannot identify the best asset, but I mitigate that by simply factoring in error rates.  Yes, I won't be right 100% of the time, but I don't need to be for my model to be profitable or for me to determine one investment is likely to be better than another, even if I can't be certain, or I can't say by how much.
You simply do the best you can with the information you have.  You can still determine the best asset based on your model-- and if you find out your model is wrong, you adjust it and then use the new model.  You can still quantify the likely average return of something, even if there are unknowns.
If your model is so bad that your predictions truly do no better than randomness (or than the market), then you shouldn't be attempting to invest in the first place.  If, however, your model DOES do better, then in some way or other it is more likely to produce the correct result, and thus going with what it says is best every time will on the whole be the highest EV thing to do.
For example, if I'm playing rock paper scissors against you and you throw 1/3 randomly, nothing I do matters, but if you adjust just a tiny bit and throw rock 35% of the time, and paper and scissors 32.5% of the time each, then my highest EV counter is to throw paper 100% of the time.
As I said, diversification may be best for people (even me) depending on their situation, and it is often wise, but it is still by definition not putting all your money in the highest value (as best as you can determine) asset.

@_date: 2013-09-01 07:04:07
Yup. Once you understand all the aspects of bitcoin and how it works and what it does, it's value is immediately self-evident.  The first time I learned about bitcoin, I was in front of my computer for like 6 hours trying to understand it, reading up on economics, learning the basics of crypto and the importance of the term "one-way function", and after I was finished and actually understood what was going on and how it worked, I had a kind of "oh my god this is the biggest thing ever" realization.
But I still had to spend an entire day learning it first.
I was willing to do that because online poker had just been shut down in the US, and poker is my main source of income, and bitcoins- even without really understanding them- were clearly the route online poker was going to take, so was willing to put in the time.  But few other people are, I think.  It's just really hard to explain the benefits of bitcoin, when you need to have at least a basic understanding of economics, crypto, and be somewhat computer literate. Most people just don't have all three.  They should.  But they don't.
And then of course their ignorance comes out to fight.  "It uses crypto? Oh well it's not safe then because the government can probably crack any crypto if it really really tries."  "Oh it has built in deflation, well it will never succeed then because Keynesian something something I know nothing about economics but I've heard the word Keynesian before." "Bitcoin obviously will never work because tides go in, tides go out, you can't explain that."  And then of course the classic argument of everybody else uses dollars, why should I switch. And I mean, if they don't care about all the reasons why, then it's pretty hard to convince them. If a man is intent on jumping off a cliff, he's just not swayed by the arguments against jumping off a cliff.

actually hoarding is what protects bitcoin.  if you spend spend spend like everybody wants, then central banks and govs can slowly buy up enough to permanently be The Manipulator.  if people hoard and just use bitcoin as their savings account, still spending when they need/want something, the market will still be liquid enough for individuals to do whatever they need to do, but those same individuals will also be protected against large player manipulation.  you can't have it both ways.  lots of spending/transaction may stabilize price and grow the economy faster, but such high liquidity allows big players to come to power.  all you need in the market is enough liquidity for any one individual to do whatever he wants to do, but any more liquidity than that actually puts the economy at risk.  a "hoarding" mentality makes it more expensive for big players to buy up bitcoin and manipulate the market.  even with the fact that it stifles adoption rate, hoarding in the end does protect bitcoin.

evidence to prove that political party systematically received illegal funding. An  investigator 
would  probably not be able to do  it  on his own. It was also pointed out by presenters from 
United States that cooperation between investigators and prosecutors play a key role  in the 
United States too, where  Anti-Corruption  Prosecution Teams and investigative agents conduct 
investigations into corruption. Financial  investigations presented by the IRS were also led by a 
team  –  **the Global Illicit Financial Team**,  -  which involves a variety of law enforcement bodies, as 
well as,  for instance, Department of Energy, US Treasury, US State Department, Inspector 
General.  During the workshop it appeared that many ACN countries also use various forms of 
investigative  teams (in Moldova, Latvia, Georgia, Poland). Some countries mentioned p ractice  of
involving or asking for opinion from tax authorities and customs rather than involving  them on a

This is why bitcoiners fight for privacy *by design*.  However, when you know something is public and you speak there anyway, I am not going to take blame for that.  Somebody who goes on TV should expect that somebody might record them, even if they later take it back and also prevent it from being aired beyond its first showing.  This is simply the nature of technology.  I am 100% for fighting for a person's ability to keep private, but I'm not going to fight *against my ability to read public speech* when that person purposefully denies his privacy.  Do you see the distinction?  One is protecting somebody; the other is infringing on somebody.

right, and if your document is a program or something where adding misc data to it isn't really feasible, you can just drum up a readme file and throw both of them in a zip file and just do it for the zip file.
there's probably better ways to do it, but it's an easy enough system for your average person who isn't technical enough to do anything more complex.  and it's still significantly more reliable proof than any modern legal copyright methods.

because most methods you know about come with fraud protection included-- which to the bitcoiner's ear means "transactions can be reversed if the other guy claims it was fraud and not a real purchase" whereas bitcoins that are sent are permanent.  all credit card transactions, paypal transactions, and most bank wires-- all of those can be reversed if you simply claim "zomg i was hacked".  ya that's insurance fraud, but it's pretty easy to do and get away with, and meanwhile you have now gotten free bitcoins.
in fact, it's SO easy to get away with that it's been done a TON in the bitcoin world, and so most bitcoiners simply stopped accepting those forms of payment.
to put it simply, reversible transactions don't mix well with irreversible transactions.

yes.  that.  that's a perfectly fine fear.  worrying about non-random generation, bugs, attacks on the algorithms-- all of those are perfectly valid concerns.
that being said, when you do the research and look into the likelihood of such things happening, you find that bitcoin is *still* safer than your gold or anything else.  your gold is far more likely to be stolen from you or otherwise taken than the likelihood of vast majority of those attacks ever happening.
but you are right.  there are bugs.  android had a flaw in its rng.  people continue to think they can pick "random enough" brain wallets.  people pick bad passwords.  people download viruses.
those are completely valid points to be aware of and to worry about.  just understand **where** the concern is **appropriate** and where it is **NOT** appropriate.  worrying about your password strength is appropriate; worrying about a brute force attack on a random 256 bit key is not appropriate.

@_date: 2013-05-17 08:23:31
Right, and my point was that by taking less risk, you also get less gain.  That was my original comment.  "Diversification is simply not being invested entirely in your best asset."  Or something like that.  I don't care about risk.  If I go broke, I'll get a job or find more money.  I want to have myself invested in the best asset possible.
There is something to be said for "if you go broke, you can't invest any more and may miss out on opportunity, and the chance of that happening multiplied by its cost makes some diversity turn out to actually BE the best and highest returning thing you can do".
However, taking all risks and outcomes into account, including the possibility of busting and not being able to take opportunities until I get more money-- taking all possibilities, their corresponding likelihoods and their total average costs-- taking all that into account, I have decided that the best and highest thing I can do with my money is hold bitcoin, even including its swings.
That may change in the future.

except when data refutes them, the logic doesn't really matter.
but you are absolutely right, there isn't any good data on free markets.  my original claim was nothing more than the data says that socialized health care and education are the best of the systems we currently use.  of course that doesn't mean they are the best possible.
i'll take a look at your video later, but again, im not arguing for socialism all together, my only claim was that data trumps all else (when it is relevant), and that the data says socialized health care and education works.
i disagree with you about free markets; however, the lack of data and the degree to which mostly free markets have functioned in the past (reasonably well) makes it so im certainly open to changing my mind.

Still, downloading bitcoin apps is more dangerous than other apps.  Bitcoin apps know you probably use bitcoin and are reasonably likely to have some on your phone.  Like somebody pointed out, if I was going to design malware to steal wallets or change addresses on the clipboard or webpages, I'd make it a bitcoin price ticker or something-- guaranteed to be downloaded by only bitcoin users.
Therefore, bitcoin apps need to be vetted much more carefully and be around much longer before the community will be safe using them.  It's not the dev's fault, it's just the nature of the game.
@_date: 2013-05-17 10:35:08
Yeah, it's basically a modified error correcting scheme.  Say you want to transmit "0" to somebody, but occasionally it gets turned into "1" from noise or something.  If you instead transmit "0000000" then even if three of them get turned into one, it's still majority zeroes and your recipient decodes it as a zero.
Now lets say you have "000111" and your friend has "0".  Neither of you are broadcasting, so there's no loss of information, but you are still using 7 spaces for one digit.  If somebody sees your "000111" they have no idea whether it's a 1 or it's a 0, and if they see your friends "0", they don't know what it goes to, so assuming you have a paper full of numbers, they can't be sure where to put it.  But if you put both parts together, you 100% know it's a "0".
Secret Sharing is a SIGNIFICANTLY more complicated version of this, and it also uses math properties to ensure that, unlike in my example, no information can be gained by anybody's "share" of information, unless you have enough shares to unlock it.
A good visual way to think about it also is to imagine you have a straight line on a mathematical plane.  And your friend also has a straight line on that plane that intersects your line somewhere.  Individually, if a person were to look at your line or your friend's line, they would only know the information lies somewhere on that line, they would have no more information than the line itself.  But now if you put the lines together, you have a single point, you know EXACTLY where they intersect, you know EXACTLY where the information is.  You can do this with higher dimensions, and you can have multiple people with varying lines, so you can make equations such that any arbitrary M number of people can unlock information with their shares, M being equal to or less than N number of total shares.  Hence it's called M of N.

The point isn't necessarily that they're lost, it's that they're effectively out of circulation.  Somebody hoarding for a long time would have the same effect.  The supply that is available for people to use is less which means that the ones which *are* available have to fill the gap for the entire market that wants to use them.  So if I hoard all the coins but one, that one must be used for all bitcoin commerce in the bitcoin economy.  Whether I'm hoarding it or I've lost it, that effect is the same.  The only difference is that in hoarding, I could eventually re-introduce the coins back into the economy.
So if the bitcoin economy wants to conduct some amount of transactions on average, the value of a bitcoin is at least in part based on the number of bitcoins available for that amount of transacting.
I don't know if I explained my thoughts very well, but I hope it was clear enough to get the point across.

Thanks for that!  Reading the threads it also looks like the DeepBit miner at 184.152.8.228 relays and work on blocks indiscriminately.  Also looks like Eligius does have a fee, less than normal, but still a fee, but at least those nodes will relay, so hopefully SOMEBODY will put tx's in a block.

I think your article is very good, but I also think you're wrong.  Economists day in and day out say the same times of things about all different currencies and other assets, and for the most part, not a one of them does any better in his actual results than just wild ass guessing.  I think economics is simply too volatile of a field to make many accurate guesses on, even considering how remarkably predictable and reliable human psychology is.  Random and/or unknown variables or aspects simply play too big of a roll.  Certainly, some entity could crash or raise the market without too much effort-- but that's simply because the bitcoin economy is still relatively small.  Without any proof, it is likely that any big moves are simply due to the fact that the market is so small.
Or you might be dead on, and you're just missing one or two things, or your guesses for one part just happen to be an order of magnitude off.  Like I said, economists have been claiming voodoo magic since time immemorial, and I have seen no evidence of reliable reasoning yet... or at least none that actually matches the data.

Well there's a counter argument here.  You're absolutely right that it IS people using it irresponsibly, and as pointed out elsewhere, they are very convenient, and it's cool and very useful to be able to get a 0% interest loan for a few weeks.
The counter argument is that finance and responsibility aren't taught.  Obviously there is a certain level where people are just being dumb, but there is at least some responsibility on the company issuing the card as well.  The question is at what point does it shift from "people being dumb" to the onus being on the issuer.  If 1% of people are irresponsible, then they're probably dumb, but what if 90% of people using something are "irresponsible" -- is it now 90% of people are dumb... or is it the company's fault for offering something they know people are highly likely to mis-use.  Where is the line drawn for comparative fault?  When does the percentage of people acting irresponsibly shift the blame, if ever?

Having a miner wouldn't matter.  People would still reject any chain that has the same coins in two different places.  Only one of the transactions would go through.  Once of of them is in the blockchain, the other would be considered invalid and instantly dropped by everybody, even if it WAS valid to begin with.  The "double spend" is really just the merchant accepting a transaction which has no confirmations and then your double-spend is the one that gets into a block, so the merchant never gets paid.  That's why people recommend for important things you wait for a confirmation.  It's easy to send out two transactions at the same time and then sometimes screw somebody over.  It's MUCH harder to fork the blockchain after a confirmation and get a new longer chain without the original transaction in it.
(Although merchants would just have a running node and look for other transactions that would invalidate yours, and then they could refuse you business and create a new transaction that uses the money you sent and sends it back to you.  That way, they can refuse you service right away, but they also don't rip you off if your transaction goes through.  Their integrity is intact and they have taken no risk, because if your transaction to them is counterfeited by your other double-spend transaction, the transaction they create is never valid either.  As long as they had an empty address originally for you to send to, they could then just go about their normal business and drop that address completely.)

A bitcoin private key is nothing more than a series of letters/numbers.  Specifically a hex private key is the same length as a sha-256 hash.  Therefore, if you can memorize steps to recreate a hash, you can know you are able to access coins sent to the address that corresponds to that key, even if that key doesn't actually exist in any wallet.  The bitcoins are safe "in your brain" because they can't be lost/confiscated, since they only exist as your mind's ability to re-create that key.
For example, the sha-256 hash of the text "correct horse battery staple" is
    c4bbcb1fbec99d65bf59d85c8cb62ee2db963f0fe106f483d9afa73bd4e39a8a
and if you just assume that's a hex private key, you can transform it (via the bitcoin documentation on how to do that) into the private key 
    5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS
which has the bitcoin public address of 
    1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T
You can import that private key into your wallet, or into a Mt Gox account or other web wallet, and have access to any funds in that address.  Now, this particular address that I used for my example is being fucked with, and contains a bunch of dust and double spends and test transactions, and it's impossible to actually use it.  BUT if instead of "correct horse battery staple" you used a password or passphrase which was *unique* and could not be guessed or brute forced, then you would have an address which you could access if and when you wanted, an address which could receive bitcoins, but which didn't exist anywhere or on any computer, and which only you could access with the knowledge of how to create the private key in your mind.
Now you have to be CAREFUL with this.  A lot of people have lost money doing this, *because humans are really terrible at picking good passwords*.  So I would advise against using a brain wallet unless you are ***extremely confident*** in the security of your password or other method of generating the key.
@_date: 2013-01-21 02:14:30
Not necessarily.  Bitcoins are actually STORED in the blockchain, which every user who uses it has.  When you have bitcoins, what you really have is a short string of text which acts as proof that you have the right to transfer bitcoins from one address to another.  So it's possible to hold your bitcoins without even a computer.  I have many of mine in my head.  I know a passphrase and a sequence of transformations I do to it which will yield a string of hexidecimal text that can be used as a bitcoin private key for an address that holds my coins.  That isn't stored anywhere.  Similarly, after a few months, Infinity Poker could determine that they have X amount of bitcoins that people are leaving on their site and that they don't need to have on hand for daily cashouts, except on rare occasions, and they could move the bulk of that amount to a similar offline wallet, or encrypt it and put it in the cloud somewhere.  That way, the bitcoins may be inaccessible for a bit while they are being raided or in jail, but the money isn't gone forever at least.

That's actually a reasonable argument.  In short, you recognize all the bad things that have been said and just simply don't trust the sources or reporters of those statements.

@_date: 2013-10-17 10:08:21
Yeah, it's about precedent.  If somebody is at the threshold of killing another person but then they have second thoughts, if it's punished just as heavily they may say "fuck it I've got nothing to lose".  Same reason rape generally gets a more lenient sentence than murder, so rapists don't just up and decide to kill the girl when they're finished because the sentence is the same anyway so he might as well try to kill her and hide the body and get away with it.  It's not that the crime is necessarily morally less, it's that the purpose of punishment is prevention (and rehabilitation, but for this argument I'm focusing on prevention), and even though two crimes (murder and attempted murder) in one instance may be morally equivalent, in another instance they may not equal, and you don't want to set a legal precedent that encourages people to commit the worse crime in the future.
At least that's my thinking.  I'm completely talking out of my ass and don't know the real reason at all.

Unfortunately, I am unable to predict the future, and since bitcoin has been steadily rising the past few years, since I cannot with any degree of accuracy tell if a short term fall is just that, short term, or if it is indicative of a larger fall... since I cannot read the future so accurately, my best bet is simply to keep ahold of my bitcoins, since on average they go up in value.
If I were playing poker, and was a winning player, and I was up $1000, the correct thing for me to do would be to continue playing, because on average I will make money by doing so.  If I end the night with only $500 profit due to misfortune, I do not lament that I should have quit when I had $1000.  I could have just as easily--moreso in fact-- ended at $1500 instead of $500, since I will on average win more money by playing.
Were I able to see ahead of time when unfortunate losses would happen, I could play and never lose!  What an amazing talent to have!
Unfortunately, as I stated above, I cannot see the future.  So all I can do is invest my efforts in ventures which will, on average, show a profit, and take the ups and downs that come with that.

The error in your reasoning is these two statements:




For point   We both agree we cannot predict the future.  However, we should still go with our best possible predictions--the ones which have a track record of being most accurate.  We use those methods to determine to the best of our ability what to do.  You are claiming that because we cannot **perfectly** predict things, we should diversify.  That is illogical.  We should simply use our imperfect best guess and just know we'll occasionally be wrong.  Knowing we are not perfect predictors does not somehow mean we should give up prediction altogether; it means we should simply know there is some inherent **risk**.  We should still use what our most accurate predictions tell us though, we just include an error rate (risk) in our calculations.
As for point  as I keep saying, my goal is having the highest EV investment.  Diversification may be better for STABLE profit, but it is BY DEFINITION not the highest expectation strategy.  That goes for short term and long term.  They are one and the same.
(Again though, as I have agreed, diversification **CAN** provide the highest value return, when you take into account problems with illiquidity and risk of ruin destroying your potential to invest in the future; however, those are merely variables in the equation, and it is also possible, and often true, that not diversifying is on average the highest return strategy.)


No, I didn't get out, because as I explained in my poker analogy, swings happen--shit happens-- but that doesn't mean that holding is incorrect.  Do you understand the example I gave with the 1/3 chance of 5x your money and 100% chance of 75% return?  It is a straightforward EV equation.
I am frustrated because it is clear to me you do now understand what an EV equation is, and it is the foundation of investing.  You simply take the probability (or your best estimate) of all possible events and multiple it by their outcomes (in dollars), add them all together, add in an error rate, and you get a range of value which is your best representation of the value of an action.  Collecting all of the necessary variables and properly assigning them values may be next to impossible, but it is still the proper way to approach the problem, and you simply have to do the best you can.  This approach, aside from being the best and most accurate way of doing things, also yields very specific and actionable results.


Incorrect.  My argument is perfectly reasoned.  There are no errors or omissions in data, and each component necessarily follows from its predecessor.  The conclusion is inevitable.  What is happening is you view investing incorrectly, and have a drastically lower threshold for risk than I do.  This has caused you to emotionally, viscerally react negatively to my argument, which has rendered you unable to think clearly about it.  If you take a step back, re-read my posts, take some time and think about what I have said, you will inevitably see my conclusions are inescapable.  (Because there is no logical error.)

While I don't know the full story of Galileo, it honestly doesn't matter.  Let's say you're right and the whole scientific community at the time thought he was wrong.  He was still eventually proven right, *because he was right*.  His theory could be TESTED.  Science is **self-correcting**, that's its nature.  If it happens to mess up sometimes, that's ok, because it messes up *less often* than any other mode of reasoning, and-- and this is important-- *it will eventually get it right*.  Because it is self-correcting.
When you shun what science has to say you are basically saying "research, evidence, and logical reasoning don't matter; I know better than experts who have repeatedly tested this idea".  The fact that you may accidentally be right in a singular area where science was wrong doesn't make that an enlightened world view.  You're still retarded, and science will still march forward and self-correct, and get ever closer to the truth.

countries which don't have socialized healthcare and education.  if you look up social welfare, happiness, average age of death, pretty much anything you can think of, and look at countries with universal health care and ones without it-- or just comparing against the US-- you will see that it clearly works better and is more cost effective.  you can do the same thing for schooling-- looking up test scores, IQ, what types of jobs people end up getting, how they do later in life in areas correlated with education, etc etc etc.  The data is unquestionable.  you can come up with any argument you like about how you don't think it will work and how governments cant get it right blah blah blah, but if you actually do an investigating into the reality of it, the evidence is overwhelming in showing that socialized medicine and education is clearly superior in both overall cost and in effectiveness.

Yeah, except people just as smart as the guys who created it would be looking at it trying to break it.  So far, they've tried to covertly introduce algorithms with backdoors 3 times, and all 3 times, with a year or so crypto experts have come out and said "something looks funky" at the minimum.
The thing is that there's simply no way to cover up a backdoor, because in order to work, it has to make the algorithm vulnerable in some way, so when they submit it at conferences and other experts look at it, unless it's amazingly disguised, they're gonna see it.  And even if they don't, the whole rest of the crypto world is going to be looking at it, because encryption is the thing that protects valuables, so if you can break it, you can get rich. So all the hackers of the world are also trying to break it.  Like the eplliptic curve thing they submitted in 2007, everybody right away said "hey this looks great, except for this one thing where it looks like it would be possible for this whole thing to be significantly weakened if you already knew some super large number because of the way this part is constructed". And the NSA said, "oh ya we forgot to mention that, but we pinky swear for realsies that we don't know that super large number"
So any crypto that's been around for a while, is open source, has many different cross-compatible implementations, and hasn't had any news about it -- like AES, SHA-2, large key RSA (for now), etc. are highly likely to be secure.
And any software that implements in an open source manner crypto which we know is secure, then by definition, there's not really any place for a backdoor to exist.  And like with the crypto analogy, Tor has many many different versions and implementations by a bevvy of different people, all of whom would have had to look at the code and how it works in order to write their software. And the fact that it has not had any significant attacks in the face of so many people looking at it also speaks to the likelihood of its safety.
Who created it just doesn't matter when it's open source. Because as soon as it's in the wild, everybody is looking at it.  It's kind of like claiming that Relativity would be less true if Hitler had come up with it instead of Einstein. It doesn't matter who came up with it, the merit is in the work itself.

If you message the bitcointip user, you can set up an account, and it will send you a bitcoin deposit address that you can send bitcoins into.  You can then use that money to "tip" other people.  When you tip somebody, it sends the bitcoins from your deposit address to the other person's address. If they don't have an account, it makes one for them.  It's just a bot somebody made for sending bitcoins to people via reddit.

Wouldn't it just be like having an alt coin?  The lesser chain would still have nodes processing transactions and putting them on the lesser chain, assuming they are "valid" by the lesser chains definition.  So all you'd have to do is create a transaction that's valid on one chain but not the other, then "double spend" it on the other chain, and now you have two entirely different sets of funds.

Exactly the same as they would have had the mailed them USD cash.  Because that's what bitcoin is, **cash**.  Layers of buyer protection can be built on top of that, but ONLY if the base layer is irreversible cash.  This is why for example the first rule of making trades with bitcoin is *always use escrow*.  Would you mail USD cash to somebody you don't know?  Probably not.  Then why are you doing it with bitcoin!?  The problem is, as I've already stated, that people don't understand what bitcoin IS.  It is actual CASH money, uninsured and irreversible.  If you wouldn't give this person USD cash, don't give them bitcoins.  When in doubt, always use escrow.
And the beautiful part of bitcoin is that a lot of escrow services can be built either directly on the protocol or using split keys.  Right now, I can run an algorithm that will allow me to create a public address for a private key that two of three people need to unlock.  So I can send the bitcoins to that address, and you can know FOR SURE, in a PROVABLE way, that I have sent the money and *cannot take it back*.  One of the keys to unlock it can belong to me, one to you, and one to a third party service.  The third party can just advertise his key and we can use it for FREE, and then he can just advertize right along with his key that any time he is required to arbitrate and use his key to unlock funds, he charges a X% commission.  This way, you and I can transact, with both buyer AND seller protection, at NO COST if things don't go wrong.  The seller is protected because he knows the buyer both has the funds and has locked them up specifically for this transaction.  The buyer is protected beause he can prevent the seller from getting the money if the seller doesn't hold up his end.  And they are both protected because they can choose a 3rd party to mediate -- a party who will only come into the picture if there is a problem, and who is otherwise unnecessary and costs nothing.
This method of zero cost protection is currently ONLY available with bitcoin, and it's also ONLY possible if I can send funds to an address which you can know for sure cannot be reversed.
So, as I said in my original post... The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.

The problem is **bitcoin isn't perfect**.  It's not designed for super micro transactions and colored coins.  It does nto scale that well.

Bitcoin was designed so you could send your family $100 across the world instantly and without exorbitant fees, it was NOT designed to handle half the userbase sending 1 satoshi to a gambling website.
But there is good news!  This is exactly what alt-coins can do, and with merged mining, it costs nothing extra for miners to verify your alt chain.
Gavin is tasked with trying to find a happy medium between how to scale bitcoin and see it grow in the world, and how to keep us all happy.  Because bitcoin isn't perfect, he can't always do both.

If you cannot see that my statement was itself a purely logical deduction, then you lack the reasoning skills necessary for this conversation to continue with any meaning.
Let me lay it out for you.  In situations with 100% knowledge, it is possible to logically deduce correct decisions, because all knowledge is available and thus all variables are known.
When there is NOT complete knowledge, then it is an error to say that you can deduce policy *with certainty* because you lack the knowledge to make such a claim.  What you can do is make deductions of *probability*, and then as much statistical data as you can in order to close the knowledge gap as much as possible.  But you must still verify your theories against empirical evidence since, as stated above, you lack the knowledge to prove it is so through purely logical reasoning.
This claim I am making does not require data.  It is a purely logical deduction.  You may refute it by pointing out errors in my logical reasoning.  You may \*not\* refute it by asking for data or using ad hominem attacks.  (Technically, you could also use data to infer that although you cannot find error in my reasoning, if the data is vastly different, then it is *likely* I am wrong, even if you cannot find the error in my argument.)
To reiterate my first paragraph: If you cannot see that my statement was itself a purely logical deduction, then you lack the reasoning skills necessary for this conversation to continue with any meaning.

You could also learn to use the Key Combiner feature in Casascius' Bitcoin Utility program, which lets you and somebody else create a bitcoin address which you know both of you cannot have the private key to, and then that address is sort of fake escrow because the money sent to it is gone if you both don't agree.

No most clients generate a brand new address in your wallet and send the change to that new address that you also control. (Since an address must be completely emptied in a transaction.) Therefore, somebody viewing the transaction on blockchain.info for example couldn't tell which address is yours and which is the person you're sending to, or if you're sending all of your money to two people who aren't you. This is for privacy/obscurity and is what the default is on most clients. That's why you would have to specify the original address as the second output in order to "keep the money in it".

It's exactly what shorting is.  Generally speaking you barrow in order to short (because presumably you don't already own an asset you think is going to go down), but the principle is still that you sell it now and buy it back in the future.  You make money that way if the price falls, and you lose money if the price rises, because you have obligated yourself to re-buy it at a future date.  "Selling your bitcoins" is exactly what shorting is.  If you haven't barrowed in order to make the deal, then you're not contractually obligated to re-buy it in the future, so I guess it's not technically "shorting" by the official definition, but that's simply because you didn't barrow to begin with.  In principle though, selling now is precisely what "shorting" is.  You just need to sign a contract with somebody that says you'll buy back in the future if you want to meet the actual definition.

In essence, we'd have to decide and agree upon morality before we can derive proper policy for anything else, since we'd need to decide what is good and bad and thus what goals we are aiming for in our policies before we can even have a starting place.  That seems about right.


Well, it's either that, or with data.  There is no *other* way to properly derive policy.  Once we agree on what is "good" (a whole other argument), then either we must logically deduce policy, use empirical data, or more likely, a combination of the two, using the data as some kind of axiomatic baseline.  Is there another method of deriving policy??


The assumed axoim was that human interaction as it relates to economics is so vast, the variable count so large, with so many unknowns, that straight logical deduction is infeasable.  If you take issue with that axiom, would you show me the reason you think it IS possible to quantify economic human interaction with a model that is accurate enough to make useful predictions and logical deductions from?
My base axiomatic claim is that such a model is not yet possible to create.  That being the case, we must simply use empirical data over smaller quantifiable subsets, because that's the best we can do.


Because even if the model is too complex for us to know WHY something is happening, if we have enough data to show that yes it is indeed happening, and it is somehow (though we don't know how) correlated with other factors, we can still make useful models and tailor our actions to do things which we know effect the outcomes, even if we don't yet know why.  That is, even if we can't link the causal effects, we can still detect and usefully act upon correlation, with real tangible positive benefits.  We'll be wrong sometimes, since we don't have perfect knowledge, but it's still better than nothing.


This is completely not true.  You are in essence claiming that any data he provides would be useless because there may be more than one reason for it.  That's a fallacy plain and simple.  As I stated above, we can show *and also act upon* correlative data even if we don't know exactly why it works or what the underlying principles are.  With out ignorance, it is still OK to take actions which we know from empirical data to work, even if we don't yet know why they work.  We may not have logically deduced the result, but **we can still get that result**, thanks to the data tells us the correlations.  We'll be wrong and get a different result sometimes, since we are acting with incomplete information, but it is still perfectly possible and acceptable to take action on empirical information, even if you don't fully understand it.  Because by doing so, you are still heading towards your goal of whatever "good outcome" you desire is, so unless you can show that taking action with incomplete information is somehow likely to make you *worse off* than doing nothing, it's clearly correct to use the data to take action, no matter how incomplete it may be.
For example, if I am playing poker and one of my opponents goes all in every hand for 10 hands in a row, even though it's a very low sample size, I can still on the 11th hand call him with a far worse hand than I would have called him with on the first hand, before I saw him going all in every hand.
Later I might discover that this player is a robot who is programmed to go all in every hand, and with that axiomatic baseline I can derive exactly how to respond to him at every point in the future.  I might also later discover that he is a robot programmed to go all in 10 hands in a row and then fold until he gets aces and then he goes all in.  That being the case, I could also derive very clear perfect strategy if I knew it-- and also that being the case, my calling him with a worse than normal hand would have been terrible on the 11th hand, since by his programming he would have to have aces.
The point is that yes, having complete information and knowing WHY things happen is the most useful thing, **but we can still take action with nothing but empirical data** without any knowledge of WHY things work out the way they do.  The data itself is STILL useful.  Certainly, less useful with smaller samples and without knowledge of the underlying axiomatic principles, and we will be wrong sometimes when our data set later turns out to have been anomalous, but even so, data IS still useful, and we can still take action on that data, confident we are doing the right thing.

This will take the strain off the bitcoin network, allow you to still do microtransactions, and with exchanges selling between coins, it should be very easy to get in and out of alt coins.  This is exactly the type of situation that highlights the necessity of multiple currencies.  additionally, [mike hearn's video]( outlines some ways in which companies and others can have their own internal micropayment system without putting that load on the bitcoin network.
I for one am very happy that this issue is even an issue.  The fact that bitcoin is big enough and popular enough that we are running into these hurdles is a good thing, even if running into them sucks.

No.  The bitcoin economy would **shrink** a fair amount, since a lot of it's use currently involves fiat trade.  It would NOT disappear altogether, and it WOULD be able to sustain a functioning economy, even though that economy would be smaller with no conversion options available.  Bitcoin would not **die**, which is the important distinction.  A pizza might go back to 18000 btc instead of 0.3btc, but some people somewhere would still see the value in its properties and btc would be worth something.  *And it would be able to stay completely functional at its new equilibrium.*

I guess I am privileged in that I have more accurately learned how the world works, and thus I am able to "bounce back" more-so than others, but I am assuming you mean straight up financially.  If that's the case, then I would respond that no, it does not mean I am financially privileged; what it means is that my understanding and threshold of risk is entirely different than most people.
I'm a professional gambler for the record (poker player).


There is a logical error.  Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not there.  Facts don't care about your opinion.  I clearly laid out the argument.
You claimed that being more diversified helped me make more money.  That is simply untrue.  It is a very simple EV equation.  And it is an equation which takes into account liquidity and my ability to react in time to bad news.  You may think I am mistaken about my ability, but the equation is very straightforward, and if the variables are correct, the resulting advice is mathematically indisputable.  Facts are facts.  Diversification ***by definition*** means you are not putting all of your money in your highest-value asset.

The way Micon goes about things is often coutner productive-- he doesn't try to be nice or go the "right" route-- he just sees a spade and starts pointing and shouting "that's a spade!" to anybody who will listen...  That being said, he's a genuinely decent guy and truly believes the thing he's shouting about is in fact a spade.  So while it may not be the most useful approach, I am 100% confident in his motives and decency as a person.  (I also happen to have met him a few times in person and we share a mutual friend whose judgement I completely trust.)  Micon is good people.

I'm a professional gambler; I understand investing.


Actually, this is fundamentally false.  The very nature of "diversifying" means that by definition all your money is NOT sitting in the highest value asset.  Now of course, this is wise for most people, since avoiding going broke is the most important thing to them, but it is by definition NOT the most +EV (highest return) way to invest.
My risk tolerance is such that I don't mind going broke.  I can find work, I can get loans, I can get on my feet again.  If I have an investment that goes bust 75% of the time, but returns 10x my investment the other 25% of the time, on average, that is a better investment than one that returns 50% on top of my investment 100% of the time risk free.  It certainly is more risky in that it will lose a lot of the time, but on the whole, the aggregate of probability and the significantly greater potential return make it clearly the better investment.
I'm sure you agree, but you would simply add that you wouldn't put ALL your money in it because you don't want to go broke.  You would put at least some money in the sure thing to ensure that you don't go broke-- and indeed you can argue that if you put three-fourths of your money in the sure thing and 25% in the riskier one, you can simply take the riskier one over and over without any loss.  After all, if I bust, I no longer have any money to invest later, so you may indeed be better off because of that.  But the higher value investment is still that riskier one, and your goal should be to put as much money into it as you can.  If that means mitigating risk in some ways to make sure you don't go broke, so be it, but the "risky" investment **IS** the *better* investment.  (At least, in my example.)


There is no difference between investing and gambling.  They are one and the same, interchangeable words.  In both, you assess potential risk and potential reward, and you make a wager you feel is appropriate based on that information.  If you think there is a difference between the two, you misunderstand the fundamental nature of them.

no, key scrambler hooks a dll into each app individually, including explorer.exe and then it runs in the background, gets direct keyboard input sends scrambled input to the application it's hooked in, and then because of the hook it descrambles it.  so any keylogger just reading input from the system and not directly from the keyboard will get scrambled keys.  it's not foolproof and it only serves that one direct purpose, but it's pretty neat.  additionally, i have Comodo firewall which lets me block everything else from direct keyboard access (software firewall, so ya it could be compromised, blah blah blah), so i know if and when something tries to access input directly without just reading what the system sends it.  but ya, keyscrambler integration is fairly seamless and you don't notice it generally.  very occasionally an app will glitch with the dll hook and so you'll type and the scrambled keystrokes are getting input without being decrypted, so that's kind of funny.  but it is set to try and fix itself whenever you hit backspace, so just backspace and retype and it's fine again.

To get nit-picky, the protocol allows for you to send the change back to the originating address.
I could make a transaction from address A which has 3 bitcoins to send address B one bitcoin, and my software would make address C to get the change, BUT I could also instead make a transaction where I send B one bitcoin and A 2 bitcoins, and thus have the change come back into A. That's a perfectly valid transaction, and it's how most phone wallets currently work.
Most clients make a different change address by default, but it's not absolutely necessary-- it's just less safe.

That is certainly difficult.  But again, only because bitcoin is so new.  You trust Paypal and credit cards and banks because they've been around for a long time and also you know you have some recourse against them via government action or lawsuits or what-have-you.  You have none of those implicit trust foundations in bitcoin, but the point is that there IS trust required, you've just gotten so used to it you don't realize it's there.  Eventually bitcoin will mature with age, businesses will gain reputation with time, and you will be able to place your trust in very reliable individuals and institutions.  In the mean time, you definitely need to be on your guard.  It is the Wild West.  Again, I don't know how much you trust me, but I do offer up myself as an escrow agent if you want one-- and one who you can *provably know FOR SURE* can't steal your funds unless you or the other party help me to do so.  That's a nice unique facet of bitcoin not available anywhere else.  Paypal could steal your funds single-handedly.  You trust that their reputation and the threat of fines or imprisonment by the government will disuade them from doing so, but they could.  In bitcoin, that is simply **mathematically impossible**.  So while in the bitcoin economy it may be harder to find trustworthy people, that is at least partially mitigated by the fact that bitcoin removes as much trust as ~~humanly~~ mathematically possible.

Again, I wasn't trying to be mean--I truly do get frustrated with MY inability to empathize here.  But like-- you don't know what private keys are-- that means you don't understand the most basic aspects of public key cryptography or again, how bitcoins are sent or received.  I just don't understand at all how you can want to use something and not want to know how it works.  AGAIN, I am not trying to be condescending.  People use cell phones and computers all the time, and those are basically black magic as far as they're concerned--and that's OK because it's not necessary for them to know, and when they break, they take them to the magic wizards that fix them.  And that's perfectly fine.  They are good decent people, they have no reason to need to know the inner working of those things--I am not at all saying that they are retarded or foolish for not knowing it--I just personally don't understand how you can use something without having at least a primitive conceptual understanding of how it's doing what it does.  Your question, for me, is analogous to asking "if I save a file to a disk and put that disk in another computer, will that computer still be able to connect to the internet?"  I just don't even know where to begin to try to answer it because the person asking the question is clearly working without a lot of information which I consider to be common knowledge and I thus have no way to start out and find common grounds of understanding.  It doesn't mean your dumb or something, it just means you aren't working with necessary information, and I'm frustrated because *I don't know how to get that information to you*

all of them.  an offline wallet is simply an address which has never sent out a transaction (and is generally stored on a offline computer or a disk drive so it can't be accessed by a virus-infected computer).  as long as you have the private key for that address, you can send bitcoins to its public counterpart from any client.  you can import that address anywhere that allows private keys to be imported.  armory, the main satoshi client, most lite clients, web wallets, wherever.  my "mental" wallet is an offline wallet.

In the alpha ZIP file (Windows binary exe), on the main program go to Tools&gt;&gt;Two Factor Bitcoin Tools&gt;&gt;Key Combiner
For one input, you input the raw hex private key of your choosing (which you can find by going to Tools&gt;&gt;Address Utility), and in the other one you enter the public hex key of the other person's address, and hit "combine" and you'll get an address that they will also arrive at when they enter their private key and your public key and do the same thing.  Neither of you will have access to the private key however, until one of you enters the raw hex private key of both your and their address in the inputs.
The tool also has a convoluted but working escrow system that basically does the same thing but allows a third party to enter, so any two of three people (seller and buyer, seller and escrow agent, or buyer and escrow agent) can unlock a a key, but no one person can do it.  Go to Tools&gt;&gt;Escrow Tools and fiddle around with it if you're interested.
Edit: for the key combiner, make sure "key multiplication" is selected, which I think it is by default.

you *must* do nothing.  But if you do nothing, it's possible that at some point in the future, your client will simply stop at a certain block and never go higher, because it will encounter a block that it thinks is invalid and it will not process it and it will wait for a "valid" chain.

Two years ago bitcoin crashed from $32 down to $2.  This year alone we broke through $32 and went up to *two hundred and sixty-six dollars*.  Who can say what will be in as little as five years?.....

His point is that many social sciences, like economics, have plenty of data available to study. In many areas, there are pretty clear right and wrong answers, provided by overwhelming data. The fact that people ignore this or wish it wasn't true doesn't mean it's not true. Flat earthers and evolution deniers get laughed out of the room in science debates, yet for some reason, in economics and politics, nobody is willing to take a firm stand, even when they would stand where the data lay.

No, because the buyer also puts up more than the cost of the goods he's buying.  SO he has say $100 in escrow, and his $50 package arrives, so now he can screw the seller out of the $100 that the seller also put in escrow, but he'll lose his $100, which is still a $50 net loss even when he has the product.
This is why both buyer and seller are required to put up 2x in escrow.  (Even if it was just 1x the buyer could simply screw the seller over at no cost.)
In short: you put up more in escrow than the value of the trade, so that doing what you suggest costs you money.

The Armory colored coin client for exmaple makes sure that doesn't happen.  But you're right, it'd be interesting to know how it's handled.
The purpose of colored coins is to have added value above and beyond their bitcoin value, so you'd not want to mix them and you'd want to give them their own addresses.  For example, I've been hoping for some entity like say MtGox, rather than issue mtgox codes, they simply make "dollar coins" colored coins, and they say they'll always buy 1 satoshi of their colored coin for $1 USD plus the current bitcoin price of a satoshi.  And they'll always sell them for that amount as well.  Then people have a way of holding USD (or stocks or bonds or whatever, backed by the issuing entity with a clear contract about the value) securely, via colored coins.
The point of colored coins is NOT to mix them with regular bitcoins, but to add significantly more use for taking advantage of the bitcoin protocol, but without adding any extra effort or bloat.

or just work in cash and bitcoin, and things you have to buy, pay for in cash under a shell LLC owned by another shell LLC, both registered in different states which combined allow you to not give any useful info when registering them (or you can just outright lie).  re- "sell" them (on paper) to new shell corps every year so that when these companies just up and disappear, your shit isn't seized by men with guns.  this was you can live "off the grid" but still have nice things like a house and car, and you aren't forced to just live cheaply and rent.
you can also set up a fake identity and get credit (cards or loans), and as long as you actually PAY them and don't defraud the lender, they're not likely to go digging too deep.  you probably can't get a bank loan without a history, but you can sure as heck get a credit card and open a bank account.

As far as you're concerned, what will happen is that it will just take longer before the first confirmation.
What's actually happening is that your transaction, while valid, is super duper low priority, so if there's ANY reason to bump it back, miners will do so.  That being said, it's unlikely there will be a reason to bump it, so unless a miner has per-configured his software to exclude no-fee transactions (which is not the case for the majority of miners), it'll go in a block.  So there's maybe at most like a 10% chance that the guy who finds the next block won't put it in, which translates EV-wise into an average confirmation time for YOU and YOUR transaction of like 11 minutes instead of 10.
@_date: 2013-02-20 01:41:14
Even with an evil client, you would still have to do at least one transaction, because your wallet is (should be!!!!) encrypted and requires a password to temporarily decrypt the private keys.  So you'd need to download the bad software AND unlock your wallet before figuring out anything was wrong.  You can also mitigate this risk by keeping most of your bitcoins either spread out between devices, or in a "cold storage" wallet, meaning a wallet file that you don't normally use and is used for savings mostly, and then your main wallet just has your "spending money".  Then if a bad client stole all your spending money, you wouldn't be completely screwed.
Also, since a lot of the older bitocin users are techie guys, a lot of them compile it from source-- bitcoin is an open source project after all, and all of the files on sourceforge and githib highlight where changes were made and also timestamps on the files.  And all it takes is one person to find out about that and post and that post will spread like wildfire.
However, none of that should be too worrying if you take the basic step of verifying file hashes and pgp signatures.  If a hacker uploads a fake client, he still won't have Gavin's (or Jeff's, or others)  PGP key, which Gavin uses to sign a text file containing the sha256 hashes of the official releases.  So if you take a little bit of extra time to verify that file and the hashes of the downloaded files, you'll also be OK.  The hacker would have to compromise the bitcoin website, the software, and compromise Gavin's PGP key... and do it all before Gavin or somebody else alerted anybody.  That's a big hurdle.
And finally, if you are STILL worried, you can take one simple additional step that many people such as yourself do as a very common safety measure:  WAIT.  The bitcoin network works across ALL bitcoin clients.  You can keep using the old one even if a new one is out.  So just wait a few weeks before you upgrade, and if nobody claims "omg it's hacked!" in those few weeks, you can be very confident it's a valid release.

ya bitcoin is difficult to use securely.  that's just a fact of life.  complaining that it shouldnt be true doesn't magically make that fact go away.  yes, the majority of people CANNOT USE BITCOIN in its current form, because they will lose it.  that's a problem.  it's also the current reality.

you are correct, bitcoin would go to zero, or at least pushed back just like current shit alt-coins are almost zero currently.

so my question to you is, do you really have deep knowledge on this topic and im just misinterpreting something, or are you just espousing your high school physics textbook?

No, it would very likely prove that you wrote the key somewhere or your computer you used to make it had been compromised.
The thing about proving brain wallets are insecure is that there's no magic about them.  Going from brain wallet to private key is a one step process.  There is no inherent weakness in that step.  The strength of the brain wallet lies directly with its randomness.


Right, well that's what makes them insecure.  You decrease the key space to "things that are easier to remember", which decreases the search space for that key.
My brain wallet is the n-th round hash of a passphrase I remember, and then to get the key I have another passhrase followed by that hash and the key is the hash of that combination.  So I remember two phrases and a number.
(There's actually more steps in there and another hash of something else, but I don't' want to give my whole process away and really I'm just making a point...)
Brain wallets can be as secure or insecure as you make them.  The reason so many people think brain wallets suck is they are simply taking the first round hash of a memorable or written phrase.  That ridiculously reduces the key space of available keys.

You're talking about escrow.  The method I described is different, you would send the Ipad to the third party, who would inspect it himself, and then release the funds to you and the Ipad to me at the same time.  In essence, this is what exchanges do.  They are middlemen for everything.
As far as nobody ever blowing up the box, of course you would.  That's the whole point.  If you release the funds, you still lose half, but the other guy gets his funds back plus your payment.  So screwing him out of 1.5x is clearly worth 0.5x for you when you're pissed about being screwed over.  Additionally, you HAVE to because otherwise the whole situation breaks down.  It's the same reason you can't negotiate with kidnappers.  Even if all goes well and they return the kidnapped person, all that does is show *future* kidnappers that you will play ball.  So you get kidnapped more often, whereas if you don't negotiate, sure it might work out poorly *this time* but you've cost the kidnapper time and effort and he's now a murderer, and any potential future kidnappers see that and know it's not worth while to kidnap your family.  Same reasoning here.  If you don't destroy the box, you make it *profitable for scammers*.  **That's a game theory disaster**.  If you destroy the box, sure it sucks *this time*, but it sucks MORE for the scammer and additionally, you make sure that it's never economically viable to scam.  If the scammer knows you will destroy the box, then the only reason he has to scam is to spite you, which isn't good reason for almost anybody.  If however you pussy out on destroying the box, you allow yourself to get scammed over and over and over.

No, they claim PROVABLY fair, which means you don't have to trust their claim.  That's why they mention it.  It's not *claiming* to be fair, it's saying, look we can prove to you for sure that it's fair.  For example, Seals With Clubs *claims* to be fair, but we can't know for sure that it is.  OTOH *provably fair* sites can PROVE they are fair.  It's not that sites are advertising "we're fair" versus "we're unfair", it's advertising "you don't have to trust us, you can audit the fairness yourself" versus "we're fair, trust us".

I believe so.  Although part of the protocol is that you always send back a "received message" message whenever you get anything, so if the sender doesn't get that, presumably he re-broadcasts it every time he opens the program and two or more days have passed.  so messages kind of float in limbo, getting resent, until they are received, and then they are deleted after a few days.  that may sound inefficient, but by god, it ensures the message eventually gets to the recipient, and it also makes it so that messages don't just sit on the system forever.  I think it's a fine setup honestly.  But ya, if you really need to send something, can only send it once, and then won't have access to a computer for a month, you should really just get a tormail account or something and use PGP.

National debts are not related to the issue at hand.  You can scour the data all you want, and you'll see that both in times of no debt, and in massive debt, increasing and decreasing debt, the relationship between social programs the benefits I mentioned remains.  In times of debt and increasing debt, social programs still lessen the blow.  The data is very clear.
The disaster of insane debt is certainly a problem, but it is neither caused nor exacerbated by social welfare programs.

Thank you for honestly answering my question.

How kind of the overlords to decree that 1 xrp is so cheap!  Thank goodness!  I might have thought a decentralized participatory smart contract system between peers, where we only pay the cost necessary to maintain the network with my own computing power, **and not pay a business**, would have been better, but for the low low price of [that which has been decreed by the overlord], why bother!  I can simply put my trust in ~~big brother~~ open coin!
IF they had built a proper ripple network, as originally outlined by Fugger, and they had simply offered themselves up as a trust-worthy IOU issuer, and found a way to monetize their business in the context of a TRUE ripple system, I would support them 100%.  But they didn't.  They made a get rich quick scheme with fiat, bought out the Ripple name, and are using it to steal the money of fools who don't know better.

Very few people know how to collude correctly, so I wouldn't worry about it.  It's also impossible to prevent on ANY site, even Bovada with it's anonymous tables, two people from eventually finding each other and just calling each other on the phone and doing their best to collude.
As far as the various scandals, there have been two major ones:  The AP/UB scandal was what is known as a "super user" scandal.  Somebody on the inside had access to their internal servers in real time which allowed them to view all players hole cards-- a disastrously bad thing!  However, the cheating players did it in a terribly stupid way, not trying to hide the fact that they had this information.  When you do things like call river all ins with ten high and open fold kings preflop, it's pretty easy for anybody reviewing the hands to know something was up.  Some players gathered statistical data on suspected cheaters, and contacted support, and at the same time, a player who requested a hand history of a tournament, got a file that *listed every player's hole cards* in the entire tournament.  That was the final nail in the coffin as it showed that that data was available to at least somebody, as well as showing that the suspected cheater was in fact playing perfectly against his opponents.  The site involved immediately changed ownership about a half a dozen times and most online poker players had the view of "if you play there, you're an idiot".
Then on poker's "Black Friday" the DOJ seized the domains and froze the US bank accounts of the 3 major poker sites, one of them being -- unbelievably -- the site in the above scandal.  The site immediately declared insolvency and said it would not be paying out player balances, and it is gone for good.  The second biggest site, Full Tilt, was, up until this time, a very reputable site.  However, when the bank accounts froze and investigations were done, it was shown they were both re-investing player funds and also giving out free "loans" with players' money to their company owners and managers who were also poker players.  They basically only kept 10-20 percent of player money available for processing current cashouts.  Apparently this is somewhat standard in a lot of financial industries, and it was legal in the jurisdiction they were operating in, but to this day players have yet to be paid from them.  I and some other people suspected years ago that something odd was up because they would occasionally bottleneck with their cashout waiting times, but this was pure speculation.
The third and biggest site, Poker Stars, continued to maintain it's immaculate reputation and struck a deal with the DOJ and was paying its players their full account balances within a week.  They have also recently bought Full Tilt and vowed to take on its debt and pay the players their balances from that site.  Poker Stars has always had a good reputation and has yet to do anything to sully it.  They also are regulated in a country that says they must keep 100% of player funds sitting in a bank account ready to be given back to the players at any time.  This is why Poker Stars has the vast majority of the online poker market.  They have a flawless reputation and a lot of transparency, and regular third party audits with their findings always made public.
As for Seals, I know and trust Micon, and I trust his word about FreeMoney.  So I feel completely safe playing on Seals.  And thanks to bitcoin, it doesn't matter because I only need to leave on there what I need to play for a single session, so even though I trust them, the risk is still less.
As far as the online poker community being degens, well this is of course true, but I don't see why that makes your money LESS safe-- it seems to me that that would make you MORE money!  I also don't know what universe $80K is a 400NL roll-- jesus christ take some shots and move up in stakes.  200 buyins, really!?

"Playing with house money" is a gambler's fallacy.  What you actually did was reduce your bitcoin exposure in order to fall in line with your arbitrary risk tolerance.  But that comes at the cost of not having that money "the initial investment" money sitting in bitcoin, which is very likely to be the superior option.  Still, it is always of course wise to only invest or gamble within your risk tolerance.  I just felt the need to point out the fallacy-- what you did or did not invest in in the past does not have any bearing on whether keeping money in some investment is wise currently.

why was it necessary to pre mine ripples?  surely an IOU system could be developed on a two-party as-needed basis.  in fact, the entire ripple protocol could exist completely decentralized with smart contracts between parties and no xrp or open coin necessary.  why wasn't the system designed like Fugger's original design?
from my perspective it looks a LOT like the answer is quite clearly: "because xrp is fiat designed to make opencoin rich..."

you should really only do that if you are trying to legitimately hide for a crime or from somebody.  if you jsut want to avoid taxes, you should remember that not paying taxes is not a criminal offense.  not **declaring** them is tax evasion.  but if you declare them and simply don't pay, they'll hassle you but won't imprison you for it.  so if you're just looking to avoid taxes, my advice would be to simply declare them and not pay them.  it's a lot easier to do that, than to pay for and maintain complete physical anonymity.  completely anonymity costs hundred of dollars a month at least, and a lot of work.  i don't recommend it unless you absolutely need it.
what i would instead do, is like i said just don't pay, but then also have a "go kit" backpack you can just grab and run out the door with if you might want to disappear in the future, but don't want to go through the hassle of doing it now.  *(edit: we are now in the realm of needing to disappear for reasons unrelated to taxes... this was just a random mind-spew)*  that kit should include a fake ID and 10K in cash (in 20s if possible), and anything else you can't live without.  i have all my important stuff backed up online, and my precious physical items either in my go-kit or in a safety box rented out in a fake name and paid for in cash.  then you have to leave everything behind, and you can't take your own car, or a bus or train or plane, so you need a reliable friend, or you simply hitchhike and eventually make your way into another city.  you need to do this so you don't get ID'd anywhere-- and pretty much all forms of transportation ID you nowadays.
ideally, you'd also have a change of clothes or complete costume kit in your bag, and you'd find a crowded area somewhere on your way to your destination, and you'd change outfits in the bathroom of the crowded place, just to add one more bit of security to your get-away.  but honestly, if you're not in Britain where there's CCTV literally everywhere, i don't think that's necessary.
then what you're looking for is an "inn and suites" apartment complex.  these are shit-hole apartments that rent on a by the month basis, let you pay in cash, and require an ID but don't do background checks.  so you can just give them your fake ID, they'll photocopy it and not do any check-ups on you, and then you pay in cash.
now you at least have a home-base to re-coup and figure out what you're going to do from there.  i personally would by a laptop and a phone on craigslist as my next steps, register the phone or SIM under a fake name and trade bitcoins for pre-paid credit cards online and pay for the phone that way, and tether the phone to the laptop for internet, and use tor.  so now you're out of harm's way, literally no one can find you.  obviously you can't use your old credit cards or contact people without being behind tor, or anything stupid like that.  but if you've decided you have to flee, it's good to be ready.
like i said, all my stuff is backed up or safe somewhere, and all my computers and phones have disk encryption.  so if i need to flee, i literally just have to make sure my things are powered down, and then grab my bag and go.  i have a flight plan ready, just cause im paranoid.  i have no reason to need any of this, im just paraoid.  i also happen to work in cash and bitcoin -- im a pro poker player -- so finding work/money after i flee is not a problem for me.  but it's something you'd have to figure out for yourself for your situation.  money might be a big problem.

Well the only source I'm citing that IS a disgruntled ex-employee is Daniel Domscheit-Berg.  The rest of the sources, even ones form his book, are quotes and interviews with other people.  He's only one of many people who have said bad things.  And why should what he said be discounted?  WHY was he so disgruntled?  Why did reputable journalists like David Leigh and Nick Davies turn on him?  What possible motivation could they have?  Have you actually stopped to ask that?  Maybe after all he is just a jerk, and that's just the simple truth....  But anyway, here's most of what I wrote up:
Ok, so before I get into all the other things people have said, the first thing that should give you pause about his character is the fact that he has **been proven** to have lied numerous times, and acted at the very least dishonorably in many others.  On the day the Afghanistan War Logs came out in the press, Julian held a press conference (video [part 1]( and [part 2]( where he specifically claimed: "We have a harm minimization process. Our goal is just for reform. Our method is transparency, but we do not put our method before the goal. If we have a serious endeavor, we do things in policy; we do not do things in an ad hoc way."  But that is directly refuted by everybody working on the Afghan War Logs leak.  Nick Davies ([source]( even said "He had no harm-minimisation process at all", and in the *We Steal Secrets* movie and the *Inside Wikileaks* book, numerous other people working on it are interviewed and quoted as agreeing on that.  David Leigh also talks about it in his book *WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy*.  And The Guardian’s editor, Alan Rusbridger, is also quoted in David's book as saying he was disappointed with the lack of editing process that Assange had.  Now Assange keeps saying oh these people are just out to get him, but he has provided no evidence or reason for that.  In particular, David Leigh and Nick Davies have a long history of professional journalism and a very good reputation.  Hell, Nick Davies is the guy that originally investigated and broke that story about News of the World phone tapping scandal a few years ago.
Then there's the whole sex scandal.  Whatever you think about the allegations, Julian has lied about a lot of facts surrounding it.  He has claimed that he was not able to see the full allegations against him, but his defense lawyer in Sweden has repeatedly said that he has that information and has shared it with Assange.  And he has holed up in the Ecuador embassy because of the claims.  FOR NO REASON.  He is not in exile.  Nobody is trying to get them.  He has an arrest warrant out for him from Sweden because he failed to meet the lead prosecutor in the case for questioning, which he is obligated to do.  He hasn't been charged with anything except basically not being in Sweden to talk with the police.  That's it.  After he lost his attempts to fight extradition for that, he went into the embassy.  And then from the embassy he has to gall to claim he's being persecuted.  *But he did it to himself*.  ***He's*** the one who went to the embassy.  Nobody was trying to capture him before that.  He claims that Sweden would send him to the USA and once in the USA the US government would arrest him or something-- now those may indeed be legitimate worries, but the important fact of note is that there was no evidence to support those claims.  The US had no made any indication they would do that.  Assange has literally been hiding in the embassy because he doesn't want to go to Sweden to face **questioning**.  Not jail, not any kind of prosecution or persecution, QUESTIONING.  ([source](  The lead Swedish prosecutor that had originally closed the case said they had re-opened it because there was enough to warrant "further investigation" not because they were on a witch hunt for Assange.  (source is the same as previous)  And as for the actual allegations, "[Both of the women] say they did not report him to the police for prosecution but only to require him to have an STD test."  One of the women said that after having sex with him, consensually and with a condom, she fell asleep and then woke up to him penetrating her without a condom.  Now she could just be outright lying, but text messages and a friend confirm that she had mentioned this and was worried about it before she went to the police and before there was any possibility of notoriety from coming forward.
Now as for what other people have said, in the *We Steal Secrets* movie, filmmaker Alex Gibney paints a good picture of him in the first half, but then randomly starts painting a poorer picture of him in the second half.  He even says that when he set out to make the film and during the beginning he felt this way:  "I remember thinking for the first half of the film, 'Sign me up for the Julian crusade.'"  And then this: I met him, I think, three times face to face [...] The first time I met him, I really liked him." ([source](  But he says, as he found more and more, and interviewed him again, he couldn't help but change his mind somewhat:  "Julian, I think, likes to be seen as the puppet-master who’s controlling everybody. He wanted to be sure I was on his side and the message would be properly controlled. And I got off on the wrong foot with Julian when I announced to him early on that I was making the film whether he cooperated or not. [...] But we had a weird six-hour meeting and he started ranting about all his enemies, and then he said he wanted to be paid, and then said that the market rate for an exclusive interview with him was a million dollars."  That being said, Gibney still supports the cause, he just wants the truth to be understood:  "First of all, the whole film is about, in a way, whether the end justifies the means? If we think that Julian is good, do we have to ignore all his bad behavior, because otherwise his enemies might get comfort? That sounds like the United States government’s argument. That sounds like saying, well, we should muzzle whistleblowers, because that’ll give comfort to al-Qaida. *It seems like at some point you have to believe in the truth or not, end of story.*"
The bulk of the rest of the negative things people have said are in the David Leigh and Daniel Domscheit-Berg books.  Interviews and conversations with people and such.
It seems like everybody keeps claiming that there's this big campaign against him or something, but you have to ask yourself, 'Why are all these people, these journalists who support the cause, saying these bad things?'  Are they all really just trying to smear him?  What purpose does that serve?  Or is it just the simplest and most obvious explanation... that Julian actually is jerk.  All these journalists and people who've worked with him all have this negative view, and then on top of that, he lied about Wikileaks redaction process and he put himself in the Ecuadorian embassy over being sought for *questioning*.  Is it really so hard to believe he might not be the fucking angle you think he is!?  Again, I support wikileaks, and like Alex Gibney said, I originally supported Assange whole-heartedly because I supported wikileaks.  But facts are facts, and every single bit of evidence available makes Assange out to be narcissistic cunt.

This is a great way to handle it.  Put it back in the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-09-16 13:09:34
Because bitcoins are mostly anonymous and irreversable.  All of your payments in the past could usually be refunded and came with insurance or something.  Like you can call your credit card company and claim fraud and reverse a payment.
Bitcoin cannot be reversed.
Thus, a large problem initially was people would buy bitcoins, get the bitcoins, then claim fraud or something and reverse the transaction.  Even bank ACH transfers can sometimes be reversed.
Thus, the sellers were getting defrauded all over the place.
So they stopped accepting payments that could be reversed.
Like paypal, credit cards, a lot of bank transfers, etc.
Remember, bitcoin is uninsured pseudo-anonymous digital CASH, as in cash money that once it changes hands is hard to trace and cannot be reversed.
That's why it's so hard to get.  I recommend trying to [find a local trader]( to meet and do an in-person cash exchange.  That's one of the easiest methods.
Yes, this is definitely a barrier to entry in bitcoin, but that irreversibility is also one of the core benefits of bitcoin.

Well, first of all, it's significantly cheaper.  Credit cards charge at least a 3% fee per transaction.  Merchants don't tell you this, they just include it in the price, but the fee is still there.  And that's just for using the card, nevermind whatever interest you pay if you don't pay your card off every month.
Secondly, it is possible to do escrow yourself without requirement from a service like local bitcoins.  There is freely available open source software, like [Armory]( or [Casascius's Bitcoin Utility]( that will do the address-splitting work for you.  Casascius's Utility in particular has instructions on it for how to use its escrow function.  Then you just contact somebody you both can agree on for escrow and request to use their address and tell them you'll accept a fee if you need them to decide.  If you tell me your PGP key, I'll post a Casascius escrow part that I've generated for you.  If you wish instead to take the time to learn m-of-n key multiplying or multisig transactions, I hereby give you permission to use MY following address as a 3rd party escrow agent:
     18Uq3uFjvr3L644nZAspXjEf3VccRuBP5K
I will arbitrate any dispute for a 1% fee, and I will only charge that fee if and when you need me.  That's a clean brand new address never used for anything-- in fact it's the hash of the key for my reddit bitcointip address, which I'm stating here in this comment just so I don't forget, since I'm never going to use that address for anything else.
If you'd like to use me or wish to ask my any questions, you may PM me or post publicly.  [Here]( is my PGP key.

The thing is, most people don't care about privacy.  So getting mass adopting with features that don't rely on privacy would be a viable approach.  And if you care about privacy, you WANT mass adoption *any way you can get it*, because the lack of privacy features are just that-- **optional** features -- that you don't need to use.  But having a ton more people using bitcoin, whatever the form and however much privacy THEY have, makes it easier for YOU to attain the privacy and anonymity YOU want.
TL;DR if you are serious about anonymity, you should back anything that helps more people use bitcoin, even features that don't utilize privacy, because more users = more anonymity for you.

There's bad news for bitcoin every other day.  Governments and banks don't want it and will try to destroy it.  This manifests itself in the beaurocratic red tape method of "not being sure if it's legal, so we're suspending accounts", trying to regulate certain portions of it, seizing assets or accounts of businesses that deal with it, and so forth and so on.
Is there ever any GOOD news about torrenting?  No, of course not.  But does that hurt it?  Is it going away any time soon?
Bitcoin is subversive.  There will be nothing BUT bad news about it.
Yet its technical fundamentals are sound, its ideals fit for the times, its usefulness too high.

@_date: 2013-04-29 03:19:53
You can't distinguish.  The address now has 20 btc.  You cannot separate one coin from another.  So your blacklisting client can't tell which coin is which.  All you can do is say that the address has 20 coins, each of which is 50% tainted.
The only way to blacklist the coins is to have miners not include their transactions in blocks.
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:09:29
Even better news is that Litecoin isn't following this upsurge, and thus I can use the fact that it and and bitcoin are independently priced in USD (and not proportionally rising) to effectively cashout in faux-USD (aka stable-ish Litecoin) and still have control of my money and not leave USD sitting in exchanges where I can't access it.

The general premise is correc: logical deductions can also be used to prove points.  If we both assume the basic axioms of mathematics are true, then if I can use 7x4=28 to prove a point, I don't need further evidence for 7x4 being equal to 28.
The problem is that when the scope of the issue is so large, as it is in economics, and the number of variables so vast and unknown, and even the value of a lot of the variables is unknown, straight logical deduction cannot work because there is no baseline of axiomatic principle variables from which to derive policy.
Thus, the only valid way to derive economic policy is through the scientific method- hypothesizing, and looking at past and present available data for confirmation or contradiction.
Any claims of a logically deduced economic policy must be very carefully looked at because of the sheer improbability of such a possibility, due to the large scope of the problem and the vast number of unknowns.
So I ask mughat again, what data do you have to support your hypothesis?

Bitcoin is CASH.  Paypal and your credit card insurance and all the other forms of protection are built *on top of* that irreversible layer of fungibility... CASH.  If cash ITSELF were able to be reversed, the entire system would fall apart.  People could do chargebacks on direct sales-- there would be no recourse for anybody to be assured that the money they get is actually REAL.  The whole PURPOSE of cash is its inherent usefulness as a means of value transfer.  It MUST BE fungibile.
Then, and only then, can consumer protection layers be added ON TOP of it.  But at the basest form, it must be completely and utterly irreversible and fungible.  Otherwise, all those protection mechanisms don't work, because there's no authority to turn to if the cash itself can transfer ownership without consent.
That's why the irreversibility of bitcoin is indeed a feature.  It's the base backbone of *all other systems*.  There can be a "paypal of bitcoin" and there can be bitcoin credit cards and whatever else, all with consumer protection built in.  But ONLY if bitcoin itself is completely fungible and irreversible.
Bitcoins are CASH.  *That's* the feature.  Irreversibility and fungibility are simply inherent traits of cash.

They encrypt the deck before they hand it to you to shuffle; therefore you don't know which of the millions of shuffles you've generated helps or hurts you.  One possibility is as good as the next.
Then, when the hand is over, they give you the cards and the nonce (and their encryption process) and you can re-hash them and see that it's the same hash they originally gave you, and you can also provably see that indeed they did deal from YOUR shuffled version.
Edit: for example, the first card on the deck I give you is f3a948c0ef727ed01dc74ca365cf5ff93ef5b06dcf61f2727d7cef978bddb303
You don't know what card that is, so how you shuffle it doesn't matter (because one unknown configuration is just as useful as some other unknown configuration), but later, when I tell you the nonce is 6816816814681168616554773321089006595, and that the card was the ace of spades, and you perform the calculation
you can see clearly that it was in fact the ace of spades and that they did indeed use your shuffle, so you know you weren't cheated.
You can also look up something called "Mental Poker" which is (a protocol) a way of shuffling a deck where all parties can show the deck is shuffled and none of them can cheat it.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:05:07
meh, i guess it helps visualize it for the average consumer.  but i mean, you can do the same thing currently in bitcoin-- you can make a tx that depends on an unconfirmed tx.  that's what gox does with its green address.  often you'll see both tx in the same block.  something like that isn't an option available in most GUI clients, but it could be if necessary.  and it's certainly possible to do.  you can even spend money you haven't gotten yet-- but the tx won't be confirmed (and might even be dropped) if the tx it relies on doesn't show up on the network eventually.  obviously it won't confirm until the original tx shows up, but you get the idea.
HOWEVER, my technical objections aside, i think you are right in pointing out that in normal day to day commerce, waiting 10 or more minutes for *any* sign of a tx "going through" is too long, so i can understand why you appreciate the lower confirmation times of litecoin.  with 2.5 minute blocks, you at least get *some* validation, even if it's less secure than a 10 min block validation.  outright invalid tx's that don't' confirm ever are thus slightly more easily recognizable.

It will go through eventually.  What's happening is that bitcoin is really nothing more than an update on a public ledger.  One address digitally signs a statement saying "I'm transfering to this other address" and the miners verify that and put it in the blockchain.  Then you can spend it.  What has happened is that the previous guy's  "I'm sending you money" transaction was very small and didn't include a fee, so miners have it at very low priority, putting most other transactions in blocks before that one.  Eventually, some miner will put it in a block unless a conflicting (double spend) transaction happens before that time.  Then, and only then, will YOUR transaction become valid and be able to be put in a block.  Both transactions, yours and especially his, are small and include no fees, so many miners just don't even look at them, and those that do, they still put them on the back-burner as the lowest priority.  HOWEVER, all transactions, even no fee ones, move up in priority as time goes on, so eventually they'll both get in blockchain-- they ARE valid transactions after all.
If you don't want to wait, you can import the private key for the address you used in your transaction into another client and create a new transaction that doesn't include the previous unconfirmed money.  In effect, you are double spending your own transaction just so you can get the coins back.  When you do that (and it gets into the blockchain), your current transaction will become invalid and no miners anywhere will accept it.  Whereas currently, eventually somebody will put it in a block, by it may still be another few days.
But don't worry about losing your coins even if that small first unconfirmed one never goes through.  You can always recover your money by importing the private key into another client and doing a double spend (with a fee!) on your own transaction, thus invalidating it.

Ok, the $40M from my cousin just arrived in my bank account, but in order for the funds to un-freeze, I have to authorize the $50 wire transfer charge, which I can't do because I don't have any money in that account besides the $40M.  If you could tip me the equivalent of a little over $50, I can cash that out on an exchange into that account and clear the funds, and we can get set up.  I'll send the $50 back as soon as the funds are un-frozen, as well as an extra hundred for the trouble.

You can believe whatever you want, but data is data, and plenty of people genuinely do things they know will not turn a profit.  I lose money every time I go to the movies.  Buying a used $2 book that will entertain me for days is certainly a better value, and yet I'm OK spending the $12 on the movie, $12 that I'll never see again.  Similarly, I'm OK spending money on a cute little usb miner that I know won't turn a profit, but it makes me *feel good* to have and to do my little bit to help bitcoin.


That's my whole point. I did have better ways to spend my money.  I WANTED to mine, for fun.

To be fair, there's no "allegedly" about it.  The videos are still up, and you can decide for yourself if they're threatening.
That being said, I am 100% on Barret's side, think the FBI agent 100% deserved this, and think Barret is a great journalist with 100% integrity and should be released immediately.
It's perfectly reasonable for somebody who was harrased as much as he was, and is coming down off drugs, to be that pissed.  But did he raid that agent's home?  No, he made a youtube video.  Did he hack somebody?  No, he posted a link on an IRC chat.
There is no excuse for him to be in jail, it's complete and utter bullshit.

Yes, I've read the white paper.  You don't need to keep linking to it.  Literally every single person in this sub knows how to find it.  Please stop mentioning it.  Yes, I've read it.
And what you're talking about only applies for a prolonged 51% attack where an attacker is secretly generating a fork and plans to publish it at a later date, negating all transactions in the "legitimate" fork.
But notice in my comment I specifically talk about DOUBLE SPENDING.  All a double spend is is negating a SINGLE transaction, not trying to fork the entire chain.  And if a person does successfully double spend, then the original "real" transaction becomes invalid since it's spending inputs that have already (after a successful double-spend) been spent, thus forever negating it the "real" transaction.
And if we assume that the network moves on to the largest chain when deciding what to mine, then a single attacker only needs to create a single block before the rest of the network in order to incentivize them to switch to his longest chain, *and then the honest network simply confirms his double spend for him*.  All he needs to do is get the double spend transaction in the block first, before the legitimate transaction.  He doesn't even need ANY hashing power to do this.  He just connects to thousands of nodes, adds a much higher fee, and sends it out within a very short time frame after the initial "real" transaction.
This type of attack DOESN'T CARE how long block confirmation times are, and thus shorter block confirmation times are as I said in my post before this, exponentially less secure against double spends.  As for other security, as I originally said, confirmation times make little difference since a *prolonged* 51% attack must still produce 51% of the network hashing rate over some prolonged amount of time *regardless of how many blocks that actually is*.  Assuming the same computing power, 10 one minute blocks are just as vulnerable as 1 ten minute block, because the attacker is mining in secret and then publishes his chain later.  An hour's worth of blocks with 51% hashing power is an hour's worth of blocks, whether that's 6 blocks or 60, because the ten minute blocks are ten times harder to find than the one minute blocks.
So, like I said before, lower block times do NOTHING for 51% attacks.  But they do make it EASIER to double spend, due to the nature of the network of jumping onto the longest chain, no matter how hard or easy it is to create new blocks in that chain.
I said all of this in my previous posts.  And I've read the fucking white paper.  If those two points are not clear by now, I give up.

This.  It boggles me how many people don't understand the difference between a currency itself and a service built on top of a currency.  A currency cannot work if it's not irreversable, because the money you have might not really be there, thus there's no confidence in it as a currency.  But reversibility and insurance can be built *on top of* a currency.  Bitcoin is a *foundation* for a financial system, it's not the solution to everything under the sun like human stupidity and the need for reversibility and fraud protection.  Those who wish to be free can use it at its base level.  Those who want insurance and protection can opt to pay for those services.

Not true.  Anything sandboxed in a virtual machine which is itself firewalled to only connect to the internet through tor does not have an originating IP address that can be traced.  It will only ever connect through Tor.  Sure, the physical machine it's on may have an IP address but as far as the internet knows, it is completely unrelated to the virtual machine.  Thus a sandboxed/firewalled VM can NOT be traced, unless the host physical machine fucks up the firewalling.

I simply trust myself and my judgement.  When I heard about bitcoin and researched it, it was immediately apparent to me that it was amazing, the greatest thing ever-- but I listened to other people got their views, and was and still am open to new information.  When I first heard about OpenCoin's ripple, I immediately thought it was way too centralized and scammy and not at all like the ripple Fugger originally came up with-- but I'm still researching and listening to what people say.
From everything I've read and heard, I still think bitcoin is amazing, and I still think ripples are shit.  If other people disagree and want to pay me for ripples, great!  Time will tell who is right.


No, investing is about risk AND rewards, and comparing the two.  An investment with a 10% chance of gaining 20x its value but goes bust 90% of the time is far more "risky" (i.e. variance-laden) than an investment that gains 25% in value 100% of the time with no risk or swings... but I'll still put my money on the former, because I understand the relationship between risk and reward.

Actually, I think by far the better way is to find local exchangers.  Certainly, that may be costly and annoying, but it should be far less costly and annoying than your method.  Even if you have to travel to another city, it's gotta be better than what you're doing.
Additionally, you have internet access.  Can you move any money of any format out of the country legally?  All you have to do is get it into a less shitty jurisdiction, and you can then move more easily from there.  With internet access and some creativity, and some good old fashioned fraudulent false information, you should be able to find SOME way of laundering money out of the country.  Heck, can you buy prepaid phone cards and sell them online?

My statement "If you can handle the swings, being very aggressive with your money whenever you have an edge is the correct strategy" is entirely accurate.
The reason I bring this up and make the point I did is because all too often, including I feel in your post, people offer investment advice that mixes up and conflates EV with bankroll management advice.  The two are entirely separate things and must be treated as such.  Certainly they are related and their relationship must be understood and properly evaluated, but mixing them together is simply incorrect investment advice.  Yes, for most people, losing all their money is a disaster and means they can't make future investments, which means taking lower EV bets now in return for lower variance is the correct long term strategy.  But what about somebody who has set aside money to invest with and wants to get the best value irrespective of the variance?  He will read such advice and if he doens't know better simply think that that's the highest EV advice, unaware that it was advice tailored for the risk tolerance of others and actually has lower EV than other potential investments.
It is quite simply inaccurate to mix EV and variance advice together without an appropriate explanation of the fact that you are doing so.
And I always point this out in financial discussions because a shockingly large number of financial advisers don't understand that EV and variance are different things.  They mix the two together because they don't actually understand what they're doing, and that's REALLY bad.  You clearly DO know the difference, but the person you were replying to might not, and might not understand why you gave the advice you did and what the context for such advice was.  He may have entirely different risk tolerance than you and misinterpret the advice.  That's my worry and why I felt compelled to respond.

He knew exactly what his risks were, he was willing to take such risks, and if indeed the worst happened, he could have covered the loss.  In exchange, he also got the potential for very high rewards.  It looks to me like he planned it out very carefully and knew exactly what he was doing.

you're never going to win this battle because you are using the wrong mode of persuasion.  you are saying apples, they are saying oranges.
to them, personal freedom is worth the extra cost in lives of others' stupidity.  to you, safety and general welfare should sometimes trump personal liberty.  they do not agree.
(and the more delusional of them have also ignored the data that freedom DOES actually COST lives due to mis-use and accidents and lack of personal responsibility from others, while the more delusional of your viewpoint consistently ignore data showing that properly trained citizenry is often much safer with everybody armed.)
i tend on the viewpoint that personal freedom is worth the extra violence that freedom can cause, but i do sympathize with the more politically liberal views.

It's only worse because bitcoins exists and there's no reason to use two separate things that are essentially the same.  If sha-2 got broken tomorrow and bitcoin for some reason could not recover and died, litecoins would be worth 1/4 what bitcoins currently are (minus the giant price crash due to new psychological distrust of the security of cryptocurrencies generally because of the sha2 crack).
The inherent utility of a litecoin is almost exactly the same as the inherent utility of a bitcoin.

That is correct.
@_date: 2013-05-04 08:56:15
So this site and thread got me thinking about how to trade with somebody you don't trust and who you feel will spite you if possible after the trade is completed.  Beforehand they WANT to trade, so that small amount of value of doing the trade is enough to not spite a stranger, but after the trade is complete, if they can fuck me over at no cost to them, they will.  I will assume that the value of "spite" is infinitesimally above zero.  That is, if there is any cost associated with it, it won't be done, but if there is no cost, it will be done.
So to begin the trade we each have two brand new addresses and we give one another the public key for them.  This way, we create two separate addresses that we can both verify as accurate and that neither of us has the private key to.  (This is done using elliptic curve multiplication a la the Key Combiner feature in Casasius's Bitcoin Utility.)
So we each agree to front 2x or 3x or whatever higher-than-the-trade amount, and we each incrementally fill up one or the other new key-combined accounts.  I put 0.01 into account A, and the other guy puts 0.02 into account B, and so on-- so we each risk about the same amount as the other person, to an arbitrarily small degree, until the addresses are both filled up with the agreed upon 2x-the-trade amount by each of us.
Then we complete the trade using verifiable non-chargeback methods.  You send BTC and I send a btc-e or gox code or cash in the mail or whatever.  We both have our side and we are confident no reversal can be made.  And we have done the trade because we both now have incentive to complete the trade, since more value is locked up than the trade is worth.
Now comes the tricky part.  We each posses the ability to unlock one of the two addresses mentioned at the beginning.  For the sake of an easy metaphor, I'll say that I have a key which only you can use to unlock a chest, and you have a key which only I can use to unlock the other chest.  The problem here is key exchange.  Nobody wants to go first because we are worried the other person will spite us if he can unlock his chest first.
So my question is - is there currently an easy to implement way of making it so that the keys can only be revealed at the same time?  And what about in situations where both parties cannot communicate at the same time, but instead only via back-and-forth e-mails?  Is it possible for both parties to prove the information they have will unlock the other's chest without knowing it themselves, and is it possible to publish a time-locked version of this.  So for example, I publish in the same message the proof that the message will unlock your chest, and at some point in the future, the message WILL be able to unlock it, but I can also destroy the message beforehand if you fail to post your message/proof as well.  So either the messages have a time delay during which they can be destroyed, or alternatively, they can only work when it is proven that the other has received his message as well.
Basically, we each have a private key to unlock one of the key combiner addresses in the first paragraph, and we need to reveal them to the other party at the same time, or do some other method that makes it so the private key I give him is only available when he sends his private key.  And we need to verify the keys before revealing them as well, so as to not be tricked.
I feel like the blockchain can somehow be utilized here.  I know Mike Hearn talked about smart contracts and stuff in the protocol, but I'm trying to figure out what can work right now.
Sorry for rambling, you MAD idea and site just got me on a thought train about how to create a trustless and incentivized trade.  If that were possible, exchanges would be completely unnecessary, and the whole decentralized exchange idea would be drastically easier.  The only thing left would be how to create digital irreversible forms of fiat, which is currently handled just fine by exchange site codes.
EDIT:  I think I found a way.  It's fucking rough as hell, but it works.  All of the incremental deposits done at the beginning in order to ensure nobody was risking more than the other are all done to different key-combined addresses.  Then after the trade, you go back and forth, passing out the unlock keys for increasingly valuable addresses.  This way, no party every risks more than the other party by more than whatever amount their arbitrarily low threshold of risk is.

no, as i said at the top of the post, that's specifically for things OTHER than avoiding taxes-- like you REALLY need to hide from people.  i specifically said if you want to not pay taxes, the best thing to do is just not pay them, since that's not a jailable offense.  i'll go edit the post to make that more clear.


A fake ID will not pass the "scan it and look up the information in a database" test.  it WILL get past a "look at it to check your age" or a "photocopy it in case we need it later" test.
if you want an ID that can get scanned, you have to legit set up a new identity from scratch, which is a giant pain, and less secure than just staying anonymous, so there's no reason to do it imo.

Wow I'm floored by the number of people who are so illiterate on tax law in this thread.  It is astounding.  If you don't want to pay taxes on bitcoin, I'm actually fine with that, but it still is (at least in the U.S.) tax evasion.  The law is pretty clear about capital gains and *the USD equivalent of profits made in ALL endeavors*.  If you want to ignore the law and say fuck em, because the technology allows you to do this, that's one thing.  But don't lie to yourself about what the law actually is.

First of all, you talk about the creeping regulation on bitcoin as if it's some kind of conspiracy.  The gov regulates EVERYTHING, *that's what it does*.  Then on top of it, you claim the regulation and the fact that you have to pay taxes somehow implies that the bankers **created** bitcoin to begin with, so they could get their cut, which is stupid to begin with because it implies that they'd WANT bitcoin to succeed just so you could pay taxes on it, which is dumb because: they don't get tax revenue directly, they have to fight for it via secondary means, like the stimulus; it's insiginfiicant compared with the bevvy of other ways they could increase their profits; it's grossly inefficient; and finally, if bitcoin did really succeed, it would take away customers who keep money in their banks, which hurts their ability to invest because they all do fractional reserve banking.
In short, you're claiming they shoot themselves in the foot in order to improve their health, and THEN you claim they are shooting themselves with a knife, not a gun.  None of it makes any sense!!!

two mods on SR2 got busted.  people think it's from info feds gained on SR1 but nobody knows for sure.  Ross is also apparently giving feds info, which is freaking out everybody.  meanwhile, the new DPR told everybody some shit might be going down and to not trust him if he didn't continually re-affirm his well-being every 24 hours.  then he disappeared for 36+ hours.  then a mod posted his gpg-signed message to that effect and said "ok he's been compromised, so we can no longer trust him... that was his instructions after all" followed by "and to the secret person whom he gave commands to do something upon a signal, consider this that signal".
so lots of popcorn watching fun.  now people are speculating all over the place.  this is fake, or the mod that posted it is gunning for power or SR2 is and always has been LE run, or other conspiracy theories... and on and on and on.
but that DPR message that was posted was PGP signed with a key that was both posted by him and signed by his old key, and his forum account was indeed inactive for over 24 hours... all of that can and has been verified.  so whatever conspiracy theories abound, that much is at least true... and lots of fun to watch from the sidelines!

Well the problem is that if your client relays it but you're only connected to other nodes who are runnign standard clients, they'll all drop it and your tx won't get relayed past there, so the miners who would accept it never see it.  That's why I said you have to make sure that not only is your config set up to accept them and relay them, but that if you are doing that, you should also directly connect to some IPs for miners in pools that put them in blocks.  You need to make sure that it is able to get to the final destination miners, where it can be put in the blockchain, because otherwise it might simply get dropped en route.
And yes, what this means is that it will jsut take much longer to get confirmed.  If you add a 1 satoshi tx fee, some miner somewhere will add it in, cause it costs him nothing to include it and so your tx still has priority over no-fee tx's, but if miner's who will accept it are only 10% of the mining network, and on top of that, your tx is only relayed to say 1/5 of them, then only 2% of the miners out there will actually be working on putting your tx in a block.  Additionally, since it's for such a low amount, it will probably be put on the back burner for a few hours.  So this means the average confirmation time would be a few hours on the back burner (say 4 hours, a complete wild-ass guess from nowhere), in addition to 50x the normal wait time (because of only 2% miners working on your tx... which is also a number pulled out of my ass).  This would mean your average wait time before confirmation would be something like 12 or 15 hours, instead of 20 or 30 minutes.  You could significantly less that time by configuring your client to directly connect to many of the miners who work on on-standard tx's.  But ya, all it means is that the wait time will be longer, even if you make sure it's relayed properly, and also that it might get dropped and never confirm if you don't make sure it's relayed properly.

We need to ask ourselves what is bitcoin best SUITED for.  Paying for food and rent is great, but that will come AFTER bitcoin is widely adopted because people realized where it was valuable and provided that service.  Online gambling and Silk Road are killer KILLER apps for bitcoin because they fit its functionality so beautifully.  We need to be thinking along those lines of what types of things bitcoin is really awesome for.  I think for example, a company offering to install a bitcoin client (or web app) inside of vending machines and charging a little extra and offering part of the proceeds to the normal vendor would be a good idea, because it's super useful for those who have bitcoins on their phone and it will get visibility and will show people who happen to watch how easy it is to use bitcoin.  But then again, Google Wallet is trying to do some similar NFC stuff for their phone wallet, so maybe competing with that isn't such a hot idea.
Either way, we need to be asking not what we'd like, but what is best suited for bitcoin.

This makes me uncomfortable.  First, the last part of the article would be humorous if the Foundation wasn't involved in the task force:


But the other reason is that it just gets the task force's foot in the door.  Kind of like how the FCC was enforcing net neutrality and NOT allowing companies to throttle netflix and torrent traffic and stuff, and that's all well and good, except it got the FCC's foot in the door for regulating the internet.
Similarly here, nobody is "for" child porn, but bitcoin is not related to that, and I think that the excuse "but the children" is used way too often to get regulatory feet in the door way too often.
But I'll sit back and see how it plays out.  As long as the core bitcoin protocol is untouched, I won't cry foul.  And I do trust Gavin.
(Although to be fair, the "no dust" upgrade also technically allowed users to still relay dust, but nobody takes the effort to do it, so even though that wasn't a protocol change, it still did technically effect the protocol.  Now, I actually think the no-dust was a GOOD idea, but I'm using it as an example of how regulation can still "enforce" protocol changes without actually changing the protocol.  The users are simply too complacent to put what the right thing to do is in the hands of others.)

You need to meet them half way before you can bring them all the way over to your side.  I generally agree with his views, but those that don't are going to plant their feet harder in the ground **against** bitcoin after hearing him speak, rather than take a step in the right direction and start researching it for themselves.  He needs to learn how to interact with people, and until he can, he should NOT be doing fucking TV interviews.  Watch some of Amir's interviews, then watch some Gavin or Trace Mayer.  Who do you think is the face bitcoin should be presenting to those looking to learn about bitcoin?  Who do you think will encourage them to look more, and who do you think will make them go "nope!" and run away?

Now, sure.  Back when bitcoin was $10, it was just fine.  Don't worry, next update will have flexible fees calculated based on market economics.
Also, you can send tx without fees, and some nice miner will likely eventually put it in a block for you, it will just take longer.

I love it!  It's an OPTIONAL layer, on top of but not interfering with, the core protocol.
I WANT reversibility and consumer protection.  My only point is that the bitcoin protocol is NOT where those things should exist.  Optional additions like this, and 3rd party companies, are where reversibility should exist.  This new protocol is fantastic, and makes bitcoin much more usable and user-friendly.  As long as you can still transact the way we can now without interference if we want, I'm thrilled to death about as many additions and addons as people want to make.  If this protocol was REQUIRED, I would be against it.

Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme.  Bitcoin can operate indefinitely with its current economy and userbase.  A ponzi cannot.  Bitcoin by definition is not a ponzi scheme.  Early adopters benefitting does not automagically make something a ponzi scheme.  Do you also think all startup businesses are ponzis?

Even a few extra gigs right away isn't that big of a deal.  We've known for a while that the blockchain doesn't scale well, and for bitcoin to really ahve mass adoption, lite clients and off-chain 3rd party transactions, and a bevvy of other 3rd party options would be necessary.  So I personally don't think large blockchain size is really that big of a deal, especially when we're dealing with safeguarding the ability of the NSA (and others) to crack addresses.

poker player here.  poker's "black friday" saw all major poker sites shut down all at once in one day, effectively ending online poker in the USA almost instantly.  the next day i was googling vpn's, photoshopping identification, money laundering, etc. since i was determined to find a way to bypass this and continue playing poker online, (which was important for me since it was my sole source of income.)  after reading up on drug dealers leaving bags of second life lindens in in-game rural houses and things like that, one thread mentioned bitcoin.  i looked it up, read about it, spent about 6 hours learning and trying to understand it, and by the time i was finished, it was immediately apparent to me that it or something like was the future of money.  it was just too useful, too brilliant not to be.  ever since then, poker aside, i've been a huge fanboy of bitcoin and crypto.  "black friday" was on arpil 15, 2011, and i was registered on the bitcoin forums on april 17th.

It boggles me that not 100% of people get this.  Money only has value if it is completely fungable.  This means completely anonymous as well.  One unit of money must be equivilant to any other unit, no matter its source.  This also means equivalent in the *perception* of the person being paid.  For the payee's distrust is a *loss in value* since that's all money is, perception.
Anyway, excellent post OP.
@_date: 2013-07-19 12:11:51
That's true, but only because I've had this conversation a million times and it never goes anywhere.  Spend a minimum of a few weeks trying to picture what types of societies could form if you just wiped everything out and started from scratch.  How long would it take money to form?  What versions would even have money at all?  What would it look like if an entire country was anarchist?  Marxist?  Something completely different?  What would the implications of that be?  What would the mindset of the people be?
I'm not answering the question because the conversation simply doesn't go anywhere unless you've both thought about those questions for a while, letting them settle, and followed it up with some research on psychology, economics, ethics, and political history.  Every time I try to talk to people about the potential for *radically* different ways of living, their minds simply aren't prepared to talk about it.  They simply can't even fathom it, because capitalism has infected their whole way of viewing things.  Their very idea of how people contribute value in the world is so narrow.
Like I said, it's highly likely you haven't thought enough about it for me to want to begin this discussion.

I'm continually dumbfounded by people who don't actually know the definition of a ponzi scheme.  A ponzi scheme will fail if no new money is put into the system.  Bitcoin will be just fine if that happens.  In both, early adopters benefit, but that's the only similarity.  Early adopters ALWAYS benefit.  They also lose out when things they get into DON'T happen to work out.  That's simply the risk/reward nature of jumping on a bandwagon early.

Syncing wallets is super easy.  Just export the private key from wherever and import it into wherever else.  Using a patched client (lukejr with coin control) or electrum or something (or just multiple recipients with yourself as output in the satoshi client), you can also segregate addresses from the same wallet file, if you don't mind slightly less anonymity.  So I have my bitcoins on my computer and encrypted and backed up online, and one of the addresses in my comp wallet is also on my phone and other apps, so I can just send the coins from one address to that address and I still have all of my total funds available to me on my computer, but I also have a subset of them available to me on my phone and other devices.  Sooo much flexibility with bitcoin!

He gambled with money he could afford to lose.  He has the $30K he took out already in savings, so if he loses everything, he can still pay it off, he just has no more savings.  They will be worse off, but presumably he has a job.  He also stated that he has informed his family about it (and that they don't like it.)  He is not stealing from anybody, he can repay the debt if he loses, and he knows exactly what his risks are.  I repeat:

I'm not trading.  I'm holding.  I traded a little on MtGox, but decided I didn't want to deal with them, so I cashed back into my wallet and am happily holding.
And this is the thing most people don't seem to get.  I'm **not** risking more than I can afford.  I simply have a higher tolerance for risk than most people do, and the prospect of being broke, while it would suck, is not world-ending for me.  I know how to get back on my feet.  I also don't have any family or people relying on me.  I live cheaply.  My expenses are less than 1500 a month.

No, but if you're trying to do a custom job, it would help to at least have the understanding that when you press on the gas pedal, it releases more gasoline into chambers in the engine which have heavy pistons that fall into that area until the pressure ignites the gas and creates an explosion that drives the piston upwards, and more gas flowing makes that happen more frequently.  It would help to understand that if you were asking how to make your engine better.  I'm not saying you should know such things or that they are necessary.  But if you're modding your car, yeah, you should kind of do some basic research so you have an understanding of the thing you're trying to interact with.

Electrum is what I use and would recommend if you wanted a desktop client, but I steer most new users to blockchain.info.
New users just don't understand or need to worry about the blockchain and protecting the network and so forth, and most of them get immediately put off what somebody points them towards the main client and they open it and have to let it sit for a day downloading the blockchain before they can do anything.  To them, in a world full of "instant" everything, and when their bank and online credit card purchases are "instant" they don't see the blockchain as a good thing, but as a regression.  They have to WAIT for something.  It's the internet, they shouldn't have to wait!

well it just means youre screwed when you get pulled over.  however, ive heard of (though not personally tested) numerous incidents of people not having their ID with them and not being hauled off to jail.  so my plan is to find somebody who looks a lot like me, and find out their information, and simply claim to be them, without my ID on me-- say that i left it at the store and im going back to get it now.. something of that nature.  i have no idea how good or terrible of a plan that is, but i also haven't been pulled over in over 5 years.  if the car is registered (to somebody, and not reported stolen) and has tags, and you are very very careful, and you have a good /plan explanation for why you don't have your wallet, i think it's possible to pull off.  difficult and risky, but possible.  but you are right, this is a large kink in my plan, and one that i dont have what i consider to be a satisfactory answer for.  perhaps it's a tic in the "pros" column of setting up a legit new identity.

nowhere were you ever pointing out that that not everyone who disagrees with me is wrong, nor was that something that was even implied let alone said by me in any of my posts.  you are attempting to misdirect the conversation.

ya bitcoin is awesome for timestamping, because you can just say inside a document ok the hash for block number X is this, and then the hash of this file itself will have a trasnaction
and so you now have a window of time between block X and whatever block has the validation transaction, in which time-frame the document must have been timestamped.

there's no good ways to do anything.  you just do what you can.
faster times usually means higher fees.  one way or another, you are moving usd cash via the banking system, which means you can claim fraud and get reimbursed.  this means the seller always has more risk.  so either you are going to pay hefty fees, or it's going to be a pain in the butt.  one way or another, you have to pay something to mitigate the other party's risk.  so like i said.....

(commenting below you instead of OP, cause reddit won't let me comment to deleted link...)
dear god why would you ever type out an address.  also, what client are you using?  most clients won't accept incorrect addresses.  the last few digits of an address are actually a checksum to validate that you typed the first part correctly, thus if you mis-type ANY character, it should pop up as invalid, and your client should refuse to do the transaction, or at least alert you.
for example, if you test an address out here:
    
it will return 00 for a valid address, and something else (usually CK but not always) for an invalid address.
so this:
    
will return 00, but changing the third letter to a lower case X, like this:
    
will return CK.  your bitcoin client, and all major web wallets do this check.  what on earth were you using to send bitcoins?

Not much actually.  I just felt the need to point out the difference between money management and the value of something.  I feel like in investing circles the two are mixed together so much that a lot of people, even professionals, conflate the two; and being a professional gambler, and hearing so many losers espouse basically the same thing, it always perks my ears up when the finance sector starts saying it.
But ya, if losing your investment is disastrous, then ensuring that doesn't happen obviously takes first priority, since without that money, you can no longer take advantage of *any* investment.

online gambling is a giant killer app for bitcoin, so at least some bitcoiners, even those who don't gamble, might care
@_date: 2013-02-27 14:48:31
it's a way to measure how widely used bitcoins are among the people who have them.  sort of like the volume of transactions, but in relationship to how long ago the coins were received.  If I get 1 bitcoin and keep it for 5 days and then spend it, on the day I spend it, five bitcoin-days were destroyed.  Same if I got 5 bitcoins and spent them 1 day later.
So every transaction that happens destroys some amount of bitcoin-days.
So like, if somebody who has a lot of coins but mixes them and sends them around to exchanges and uses them a lot-- that's great and all, but he's not destroying too many bitcoin days.  Whereas somebody with a lot who's held them a while and then desides to spend them destroys a lot of days.  So the metric "bitcoin days destroyed" values that new person introducing his older money into the economy.
It's a sort of measure of the vitality of the bitcoin economy.  Whether bitcoins are being used versus hoarded.  A lot of bitcoin days destroyed means that bitcoins are being used and the bitcoin economy is growing and doing well and is vibrant.
Does that make sense?

A 51% attack on one block simply has a X% chance of succeeding if you run it less than Y amount of minutes.  A lower block time makes it so the attack gets some blocks sooner, which is why I said above that the lower block time means, among other things, less secure blocks.  HOWEVER, as I'm writing this it occurs to me that another repercussion of this is that as soon as the attacker gets a block, everybody switches over to that block, whereas in bitcoin (assuming the same amount of time) yeah they still switch over right away, but the attacker doesn't get a block nearly as often.  This means a double spend is *exponentially* easier as the time required for a confirmation decreases.  Hmmm.... I hadn't thought about that before.  Yeah, definitely I want slightly longer confirmation times.  I think litecoin's 2 minutes is the lowest I'd be comfortable with now that I've had this revelation.

You should wait for the 0.8 release, the initial sync up will be much faster.  (And BTW, you only have to do that sync once, from now on, your "sync" only has to catch up from teh time you last had the client open.)  What is happening is that you are downloading the entire public ledger, i.e. the blockchain, which is the public record of which bitcoin addresses have how much money.  This way it knows if a transaction is valid, and if you get any money, and so forth.  So if somebody sends you money, you might see "unconfirmed" meaning the transaction was sent out, but it just hasn't been updated in the public blockchain just yet, so you can't re-spend that money until the blockchain updates it, which usually takes 10-30 minutes.

It's because it's a gambling transaction.  A lot LOT of miners view them as spam and simply refuse to mine them.
I'm happily surprised that the network is getting big enough where miners can afford to reject tx's that have a fee, even a small fee, in them-- but OTOH I feel bad because you, a user, are being grossly inconvenienced over a legitimate transaction.
This is a product of the whole "bitcoin does not scale well" problem, and miners are trying to force gambling sites to use deposits and off-chain transactions rather than "spamming" the blockchain itself.

Yes, the network could heal itself.  Remember, a miner cannot forge transactions, all he could do is block transactions from confirming and do more effective double spends.  And remember, some honest miners still get blocks in on occasion.  This basically means the attacker would drastically SLOW DOWN the bitcoin network, a very considerable amount, but that's a *worst case scenario*, and it would have to be *sustained*.  Were something like that to happen, a lot of normal folks, like me, would happily turn back on our GPU's to try to get him at least under 50%, and I'm sure many of us would decide to buy an ASIC.  In fact, the more I think about it, the more I think BFL should, strategically speaking, start an anonymous 51% attack in order to force users to buy their product at higher cost.

When you mine blocks, you try to get the final hash to within a certain value, so you add random garbage to the block, called a nonce, to change the hash in an attempt to get the correct hash value.  The first block's nonce included the date and that headline in addition to garbled random garbage data.
It's a time-stamp to prove that the first block must have been mined on or after that date.
Now that the blockchain is popular enough, it can be used as a time-stamp within a window of time.  You simply say "the hash of bitcoin block number X is Y, and the hash of this document that these words are in corresponds to some bitcoin address, which will receive funds from address Z".  So then the document must have been created within the time frame of the block number whose hash was listed and the block in which the transaction occurs.
Further, you can pseudo-anonymously 'copyright' the work by going on to say "should the information contained in this document appear elsewhere, the earliest time stamp shall be considered the valid one, and whoever can sign a message with the bitcoin sending address of the second part of the time stamp (address Z from the previous paragraph) shall be considered the true owner and creator".
And in the next update where you can include 80 bytes of any data you want, you can probably do even more.  And then with color coins, you can distribute shares of your own publishing company that publishes that "copyrighted" work... :-P

this is yet another example of a free market failure.  free market advocates always forget that humans are continually stupid.  if people would stop using gox and go to an exchange that places self regulations on these BS trades, the problem would fix itself.  unfortunately, people are fucking stupid and will continue to use it because the multiple-small-tx day traders provide liquidity.  and gox will allow it cause they make money *and nobody will leave, so they know it doesn't hurt them*.
so as it stands, the only choice is to individually be smart and not use them, yet still be at the whims of their price manipulations, and suck a giant dick cause you have no alternatives.  when the bitcoin economy grows large enough, this won't be as much of a problem, since the market will be so over saturated with legitimate users.  but in a small economy like this one, price manipulation is simply not going to stop, because people are stupid and won't collectively gather to stop it.  classic game theory with the nash equilibrium landing smack in the "all players continue to fall victim to price manipulation" outcome.

Yeah, no worries, as you've probably seen, it happens all the time.  People simply aren't *used* to bitcoins.  If somebody told you they were sending USD cash in the mail to somebody they'd never met and then expecting to get something back from that person, you'd think they were stupid, *obviously* it's a scam.  But that same warning bell just doesn't register with bitcoin transactions, even though it's exactly the same type of situation, because you're simply not used to things online working that way.  Now, of course, in your case, you just sent Paypal first, but the principle of the argument still holds-- the economy is new, more anonymous than most, and without the safety and security of all the normal modes of transacting.  Normally when you use like your credit card for example, you don't even think about being scammed, because it has built in fraud protection.  You just have to remember that the bitcoin economy is new and such layers of protection aren't built onto the normal ways it's currently used.  You have to treat it like the wild west, and always protect yourself.  Everybody is trying to scam you.  I liken it to the quote somebody said people in the army use -- be nice, be courteous, be willing to make friends... and be willing to immediately kill that person if they turn out to be the enemy.  That may not seem like a healthy way to interact with people, but my point is that you must always protect yourself first and foremost, because you WILL be taken advantage of if you don't.  Healthy or not, that's the reality of the situation.  Hopefully, as adoption grows and it becomes more legitimate as a currency, more legitimate businesses and insurance options will arise for users, but for now, you have to watch out.

I am attempting to make a peer to peer program program to do exactly this.  Unfortunately, I simply don't know enough currently.
You can't actually do peer to peer poker with somebody else, because of the shared "pot" of money that accrues during betting, and you can't trust that the other person will fulfill his obligation after the hand is over.  Nor can you both just put money in M-of-N faux escrow, because if he loses everything, he doesn't get harmed by simply denying you the money.  So you still need a trusted third party to host the game and ensure payouts as far as I can tell.  But you can still do that in a distributed peer to peer system, with varying hosts competing to host games.  [Here's]( a summary paper I wrote outlining the gist of how I think such a system could be implemented.

Green addresses don't make transfers instantaneous.  They are simply well known addresses that are known to belong to large companies, whose reputation would be hurt by a double spend, so you can trust that even though a transaction has no confirmations that it will go through without a problem (assuming it's a valid transaction).  They aren't anything magical-- they're just somebody claiming publicly "this is my address, so if you trust me to not screw you, you can trust zero confirmation transactions from this address".  The transaction itself is no faster than any other transaction, and in many cases it's slower, but it's value is simply "backed" by the guarantee of the person who owns the address.
And as for OP's unknowns, those aren't unknowns, and they're easily explainable.  A bitcoin is a credit in a shared ledger, nothing more.  As for a paper wallet, that's just a private key for an unused address written down on paper.  It's "safe" because you've never used the address, so there's no chance of a trojan or some other hack stealing it.

That goes away in places like Portugal where in addition to access, the cultural taboo against it goes away and people seek help for their problems and are safer about it; however, in societies that condemn it, if you provide an easier way to get them, there is a direct link to how many people will use them.  It's not only "people who want them will get them" and "people who don't will not", there's also a subset of people "sort of want to try them, but won't because it's likely they'll get caught or get hurt".
You are absolutely right though that for people who are going to get them no matter what, this is clearly the better option.  Gang violence and monopoly prices are both replaced by free market competition and anonymity.  It is clearly a more desirable method.  But that doesn't make it GOOD, just *better*.  Drugs are still bad do long term damage.

Diversification by definition means knowingly not having your money in the best performing asset.  The only reason to diversify is to mitigate risk, since by definition you lower your average return by doing so.  For most people, this is the correct strategy, since avoiding going broke is a higher priority than maximizing EV.  That is simply not my priority.  If two assets seem similar value, then sure I'll diversify since it costs me nothing, but for now, bitcoin is where it's at.  I'm considering piling into litecoin though too.

It's a common con.  A 3rd party conman comes in-between two legitimate traders, and tells each one that he's the other.  Then one of them sends funds to him, he takes off, and the guy who sent funds thinks it's the other legitimate person who stole from him, since neither are aware that there were ever more than two people total.  Meanwhile the other guy is very confused and says "wtf are you talking about you haven't sent me anything!" and the guy who lost his money thinks he's been scammed by this guy now.  So Person A loses his money, Person B loses his reputation, and Conman C gets away with money.
Edit: Actually, re-reading it, that may not be what happened here.  I'm not sure.
Edit 2:  OK I think what actually happened was a variation on the scheme I laid out.  Coman gets Person A to send funds "first".  Person A sends funds to Person B thinking he's sending funds to Conman in a legitimate trade for which he's just sending first.  Conman now tells trustworthy Person B "ok I sent funds, see!" and Person B, thinking that money sent from Person A was actually sent by Conman, sends funds to Conman.
Edit 3:  Nope, that's not what happened.  Fuck, I can't tell what exactly happened.  It looks like it was a variation on the Edit 2 scheme, except that it then additionally sent a phishing e-mail to Person B after the fact, getting those funds (originally A's funds) as well.  So the Conman then makes out with both A and B's money.

well shit, i hate being wrong, but i was clearly wrong.  thanks for spreading correct information!
@_date: 2013-05-17 11:10:24


No, they are the same.  Holding was correct in the "short term" because the future is impossible to know.  I cannot 100% know the future, but if I know it 90% I can still act on that information.  I don't understand why this is difficult for you.


Again, this is a logical error on your part.  You think that because you cannot know FOR SURE that a bet is best that you should diversify.  This is not true.  Knowing that a bet is *probably best* is still good enough to act on, and will on average be the best possible investment you can hope to make.  The fact that it may turn out wrong is irrelevant.  It's still the **absolute best you can ever do**.  You are correct that diversification mitigates risk, but as I keep saying, it is NOT necessarily the highest profit move.  Sometimes the higher reward makes higher risk WORTH the risk.  Risk is nothing more than an element in the equation.  The equation may still say that not diversifying is best, even with substantial risk.


This is a mathematically untrue statement.  Think about that for a second.  This is the core of your belief and why we disagree.  And it is wrong.
Now I will outline why.
If you have no information at all that one choice is better than the other, then it doesn't matter what you pick, since as best you can tell they are the same value.  In this instance, you SHOULD diversify, because they are all equal value (as far as you can tell), and thus diversifying and mitigating risk **comes at no cost**.
If however, you have any information at all that can help you make a more accurate decision, you can change your plan.  Here's an example.
Let's say you have 5 investments.  You have gained a little bit of information that makes you think they are not all quite the same, even though they are close.  Four of them (A,B,C, and D) have a 19% chance of returning your money plus 4x more, and a 81% chance of you losing everything.  One of the five (E) has a 24% chance of returning your money plus 4x your investment, and a 76% chance of going bust.  What is best way to invest your money?
There is only one correct answer, and that answer is to put everything in E.
If you want to mitigate your risk, you simply hold some money in cash, and invest up to your threshold in E.  ***Putting any money at all in A, B, C or D is a bad idea.***  Putting as much as your risk threshold will allow into E (until you find a better investment) is the best choice you can make financially, even though it has a high risk of busting.  If you cannot afford to lose certain money and wish to risk less and keep it in cash, that's your choice, but you will make more money on average by putting as much as you can on investment E.  ***Under no circumstances is it correct to put any money in A, B, C, or D.***  You should only invest in E or hold in cash, depending on what your risk threshold is.
Do you understand that this is true?  Do you understand why?  This is at the core of our disagreement.
The fact that you can't know 100% which of the five will succeed doesn't mean you can't make the best decision with the information you have.  And the actual outcome -- whichever investment ends up working -- doesn't actually matter in the end, since all you can fix is your information gathering and decision making process.

This is why 1.5-2x is a good amount.  It's more than the trade itself, but still low enough that if A screws B, B may feel it's worth while to make sure A is screwed as well.  If the escrow is like 10x, B won't do that.
A more ideal solution would be smart contracts implemented into the main client protocol, so that a transaction can be made which will only happen if/when another transaction occurs and also only if that other transaction doesn't have a double spend tx sent out within the first say two minutes.  Then you add some randomizer, so that the a bad guy can't just sit with a timer and send out a double spend at the last second.
That way, you can PROVE your intent of the transaction, because you've broadcast it, but you can also be assured that the money is released only when both parties agree, and they can't screw each other, and if they try, the transaction doesn't happen.

I agree with what you said, although I feel like you're getting bogged down with semantic definitions that just aren't necessary and only serve to cause confusion.  Rather than using "settled" and "extinguished" I think it would be better to simply describe the nature of the transaction, in terms of what each party is trading and also what the conditions of the overall transaction are, including any possible 3rd party involvement.
But again, this is all just semantics.  I view the word "transaction" as the entire series of events involved in a mutual two- (or more) party trade, whether that's usd for bitcoin, gold for painting my house, or a one-way donation in return for nothing.  And were I talking to somebody about it, I would simply explain the entirety of it to make sure they understood the nature of the transaction as a whole.
I also think Bitcoin serves well for both yoru "settlements" and "extinguished" transactions.  I just think that other layers and protocols and companies can be added on top of the core protocol to perform "settlement" actions within transactions.
Gah, I'll stop rambling, sorry.

obfuscating meta data is very difficult, because you have to be aware of literally everything you do.  like ya your e-mail is encrypted, but if they know who you e-mailed and what time, they can infer things from that.  so pretty much in your every action you have to take pains to obscure it.  so like, you'd have to use anonymous e-mail services, encrypt it, change up the times you send your e-mail, if you post on a public forum, even under an alias, you'd want to run what you write through a language translator to another language and back to weed out any particular mannerisms you may have in your way of speaking/typing that can identify you, etc etc etc.
basically, you really should just use tools that fit your threat model.  because actually obfuscating EVERYTHING is near impossible, and just a giant pain.  data is everywhere.  everything you do is meta data.

no, it'll just prove that you picked a poor brain wallet, like such posts always proves.
"brain wallets" are nothing magical-- just a way to get to a set of hex data that you wouldn't otherwise be able to remember.  if you pick a shitty enough method, whether it's shitty because it's a bad password, or because of some other method -- like the shitty RNG in Android that got people's money stolen -- whatever the reason, if you have low enough entropy in the space of possibilities to get at your key, it will be compromised.
as long as the password has at least as much genuine entropy as a sha256 hash ("genuine" meaning won't be guessed-- i.e. genuine "random" entropy), then your brain wallet is as secure as bitcoin itself.  if it's lost, it'll be because it doesn't have as much entropy, or because it was compromised in some other fashion, like you wrote it down and somebody found it.
there's nothing inherently good or bad about "brain wallets".  what's bad is people picking really unsecure ones and thinking they are even close to as safe as randomly generated addresses.  they aren't.  the only way to make them that safe is to simply take the effort to commit to memory the private key of a randomly generated address.  THAT would be a secure brain wallet.... of course it'd also be way more likely to be lost because you forgot it... but it *would* be secure.

This advice needs clarification, because it can be bad advice in a vacuum.  You need to understand the underlying REASON people say this.  The reason people want to diversify is to protect themselves from potential disaster if the only thing they have invested in goes south.  It's simply risk management.  But risk management **comes at the expense** of having a worse performing portfolio, because your investments are not all maximizing their potential return.  Look up the gambling term "EV" or "expected value".  That's the actual value of a thing, independent of it's variance and risk.  The risk, while often related to the EV, is an entirely different concept, and if OP is fine with taking much higher potential risk, he can maximize his expected value by putting all his eggs in the highest performing basket.  Diversifying is all about protection, NOT making the highest returns.  That's wise for *most* people, but it may not be OP's goal.  Diversification for diversification's sake does NOT make sound investment strategy.

The plane is a joke.  The Silk Road escrow system holds the bitcoin in escrow when you purchase something and only releases it to the seller when you "finalize" which is hitting a button saying to release the funds to the seller because you got your item.  They advise you to never finalize early, because they won't reverse a transaction, so if you finalize early the seller could screw you.  So a lot of "shady" sellers say on their posts that they'll only do trades if you finalize early, and some legit ones ask you to finalize early simply to get their money sooner rather than later.
But ya, a plane could be sold in a much more visible place than Silk Road if it was acquired legally.  And given how hard it is to steal a plane, in combination with the fact that it would likely be listed somewhere, you should already be assuming this is a joke.  But then the "must FE [finalize early]" cinches it as a scam/joke.

Now it's just another Tor site with no trust at all.  Additionally, DPR just changed his PGP key, which could easily be a coincidence but is certainly odd timing.

The thing is, bitcoin does not scale well.  It's not perfect.  Sometimes what works and what you want just aren't the same thing.  Bitcoin won't scale well if we keep all the spammy transactions.  That's just a fact of the protocol.  What Gavin did was try to make a way to make sure it can still scale and still allow people to send $0.01 if they want to.  He's trying to find a happy medium to keep bitcoin the well oiled machine that it is, but still not screw people over with say a $10 limit.  And not only that, this is a SETTING which can be CHANGED very easily.  If you don't like it and you want to make sure your super tiny transaction can get in a block, all you do is change two things in your config file, and add a few "connect=" IP addresses from a pool that accepts non-standard transactions.  Luke-jr's Eligus pool has always put non-std tx's in blocks.  So just post around and say "hey I'm looking for some miners who work on and relay non-std tx's because I don't like this new 0.8.2 update, can you guys give me your IP addresses?"  BAM.  Now your transaction will just take longer to confirm since not everybody is working on it.
You know some pools already block Satoshi Dice tx's?  They don't want to add them to the blockchain because they view it as spam.  This update is no different.  It's trying to find a balance between what people want and what will help bitcoin.  And it's *entirely optional*.  All that will happen is it's a little more work for you to make your small transaction and it will take a little more time to get confirmed.

He's not broke.  He has 30K in savings.


No, but if you understood the risk involved, and were willing to accept a completely new lifestyle of being broke, and you were fully aware of this, and you deemed that risk worth while for the chance of the reward, then it's not necessarily an unwise transaction either.  It's just not something YOU personally would do with your money, but that doesn't make it inherently wise or unwise.  You are projecting your own views on acceptable risk onto others.

Incorrect.  Miners still must abide by the protocol.
If they don't, everybody will reject their block, and other miners will re-do that block correctly because they know nobody will use the wrong block and thus building on top of it is useless.  The ONLY thing miners can do is choose which transactions to put in their blocks.  That's the only choice they can make.  And that is "solved" by using fees to incentivize them and create and economic equilibrium.
Everybody has a false notion that bitcoin was designed for micro-payments.  It has *worked* for them while the network is small, but it wasn't *designed* for that.  It was designed to be the **backbone** of payment systems, and it's expected that companies and other reasonably large entities will do instant micropayments within their own internal networks.  Bitcoin has been handling this for the time being, because it could, but it's getting large enough now that it is significantly more taxing on the network to do that.  Now is when businesses need to start doing their own internal networks and alt-coins can come in and have their time in the light, being great both for micropayments and for backups in cash bitcoin's encryption fails.
Quite simply, bitcoin itself was NOT designed to do massive micropayments.  It never was intended for this purpose.  Everybody thinks it was because it's been used for that for a few years, but now we are seeing the cost associated with that.
Bitcoin was designed so you could transfer $500 to your family around the world almost instantly and almost free.  It was designed so companies could do business with customers for 100s or 1000s of dollars without interference with the government.
It was NOT designed so you could send a fraction of a penny to a fucking gambling website.
I agree with everybody that SD is a good stress test for bitcoin.  Or rather, it *was*.  We've seen the results of the stress.  Bitcoin cannot handle it, plain and simple.

Yeah the DOJ thinks things that are legal aren't, but when they actually went to prosecute, e.g. online poker's Black Friday, all the sites were only charged with money laundering and conspiring to violate the banking regulations part of the UIGEA.  None of them were ever charged with running a gambling operation.

You can also time-stamp it by including the hash of the most recent bitcoin block in your intent message.  Then, the message MUST have been created between the time of that block and the time the the transaction from step 7 is broadcast.
That type of thing can make a provable time-stamp window of as little as 1 or 2 blocks (if you do it fast enough) for the time frame that that message MUST have been created.

Uh... YES, yes it does.  Did you READ the definition??  Or did you not read my comment?  If you are distributed among different things, then **by definition** you are not fully invested the the most profitable singular entity.
As to the point in doing such a "risky" thing-- sure, I might go broke, but I also reap the upside of higher rewards, specifically because I am (entirely) invested in the highest value asset.  I am willing to make that trade-off.
If I could offer you a bet that gave you a 2/3 chance of going broke and a 1/3 chance of getting 5x your money on top of your original investment, or a bet which gave you a 75% return every single time, which would you take?  One of those bets returns more than twice as much as the other on average.
I simply choose to take the higher EV gamble, even if it has more variance.  Additionally, I can cash out any time, so the moment I feel bitcoin is no longer worth such risk, I can convert it.
That all being said, I am doing this not as an investment but because I wish for bitcoin to be my "bank".  I believe in bitcoin and I use bitcoin.  Bitcoin is simply where I keep my money.  It also *happens* to be where I keep my investment income as well, since I believe it is also the best investment, but that may not be true in the future.
But bitcoin will always be my bank.  I'll take the swings of bitcoin over the inevitable losses of fiat any day, for the same reason I'll take the 2/3 - 1/3 bet every time.  Value is value.

From the looks of it, Mailpile is just another webmail client.  What they need to do is make a dead simple one-click-setup mail SERVER for average users.  Then an average person could rent a super cheap server and host their own e-mail, or host it from home.  Ideally it'd also have a setup where it automatically encrypts message and then securely wipes the originals.

I scanned it multiple times multiple ways, and every time it either didn't work, or worked perfectly.  QR has built in error correcting, so it wouldn't have worked at all with a far higher probability than it would have spit out an incorrect value.  It's kind of a binary yes or no thing.  Either it scans to the correct value, or it doesn't work at all.  That's what the error correcting is for.  I'm honestly having a hard time believing you.  Did anybody else get it to scan to something else?  Also, either way, why are you being such a dick about it!?

Yeah, but to be useful as evidence, it needs to be verifiable, so having it be easily verified by using my method is much better than a giant amount of iterations that anybody who wants to verify it now has to go through.  It would make much more sense just to timestamp it or otherwise prove it in an easily verifiable way would it not?
Edit: nevermind, I misunderstood what you said.  But how is your version different than a hash of a hash?  And how can he prove its authenticity as being from an earlier time.  Surely he could simply LATER create an IP/hash combo at his will and claim that was what he had all along-- unless he gives it up ahead of time or otherwise timestamps it, he has no proof.

The problem is he's right.  Whatever algorithm you have, it has a far reduced keyspace from 2\^256.  He may not be able to crack it, because what you have done is rare and common cracking tools thus aren't set to look for it-- so in that sense you're "safe" -- but the fact remains that you have greatly reduced the entropy of possibilities by coming up with your own algorithm.  It's probably secure for now, but it's guaranteed to be less secure than a lot of other methods.  And that's even accounting for the likelihood of using secure methods within your algorithm-- the procedure itself is still likely weak, and this the inputs to those secure methods are weak as well.
Again, this is mostly theoretical, and it's unlikely you'll be compromised since somebody would have to design their cracking methods just for you, rather than throwing more money at things like first-round hashes of phrases to mine brain wallets.  But if you're going to be mean, you need to at the very least be right.  And strictly speaking, you're not right.

I believe that's true in the short term but very false (and dangerous) in the long term, for the reasons I outline in the post.

The /system/ folder won't have what you need.  Not even the data for system apps is in that.  You need the /data/ folder.  Specifically, you need the /data/data/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/  folder.  Even more specifically, your keys are in the file:

Health care is a really REALLY bad example.  You should have picked almost any other example.  Every other first world nation has single payer health insurance and despite what you may think about waiting a day longer for something, every welfare and social statistic imaginable points to that being a raving success.  They live longer, they're happier, they have less infant death, on average health care costs are much less, people get preventative care, and on and on and on.  Medicare despite its inefficiency has only a 3% overhead.
Now then, back to your main point about taxes.  There's another fundamental problem with that argument, which has yet to be addressed by libertarians and anarcho-capitalists, which is that human beings are exceedingly bad at money management.  They act with their money like drug addicts act.  They continually sacrifice long term well being for short term gains.  They don't plan ahead at all.  That's a statistical fact.
(And if you want to argue for the individual, then at what point does poor individual planning become an epidemic?  If 5% of people do it, it's stupidity on their part... but what about when 99% of people do it?)
This is why every attempt at anarchist communes in history fail once they get beyond a small number of people.  Nobody wants to pay for roads they don't use.  Nobody wants to pay for health insurance for other people... until they get really sick.
Additionally, all statistical data shows that the better social welfare programs there are, the lower the taxes generally, because that safety net allows poor people to get on their feet and become working taxpayers much sooner than they would otherwise be.  That's the only way you get a thriving middle class.
Now you can come up with a bevy of arguments against this, which basically revolves around how important individual choice is.... but what you *can't* do is say that the DATA supports you.  It very VERY clearly doesn't.  The only acceptable argument is "damn the data, freedom is more important".  And that's a reasonably fair argument.  But you really can't claim anything else.

There is no evidence of that, other than his positive comments, which he would also say if he simply *actually liked it*.  Which is completely reasonable to think if he knows more about it than the general public and trusts the Open Coins guys.
I hate ripple and opencoin, but I don't think it's an outright scam attempt.  I think it's a genuine attempt and a terribad execution, but without any bad intentions.  But if Fugger knows more about it, like what the source code is and when it will be released, and the workings of how it may be decentralized in the future, it's completely reasonable for him to be supportive of it.  Unless there is evidence other than his support, it's illogical to assume he is being paid to shill for it.
I'm still not touching it with a ten foot pole, but I don't think it's an intentional scam or that Fugger is being paid to praise it when he secretly thinks it's shit.

money laundering is anything involving the act of moving funds around to disguise their original source.
if you buy the chicken with drug money with the intent to re-sell the chicken, so when the police come knocking at your door wondering where all this money came from, you can say you found some chickens, then that's still money laundering, and buying the chicken is part of it.

In the US they are legal.  Non-sports betting interstate online gambling is legal in the US.  It's just not legal for banks to process transactions from known gambling sites.
Because of that, it's **effectively** illegal.  However, bitcoin solves that problem quite nicely.  Not that regulation won't soon follow.  Most bitcoin gambling sites still have eu domains and/or (like SatoshiDice) don't accept US players anyway, just in case.
But the real issue is, who fucking cares.  It's bitcoin, and it's the internet.  Seals With Clubs for example could just get an onion address, and Micon or Freemoney could just verify that it is indeed them, and everything could keep on trucking.  Or if they don't have AML and KYC since they only deal in bitcoin, they could just say "no US customers" and just force you to use a proxy, because changing IPs is really really easy.  It's not like it's super difficult to play on SatoshiDice in the US after all.  That's the power of bitcoin, and of the internet itself.

That's exactly what has happened.
Import the private key for the address you're trying to send FROM into another client, create a new transaction, and send away.  And you don't need anywhere near that big of a fee.  0.0005 for a fee will get your tx into the next block more than likely.  And honestly, no fee will get it fairly quickly as well.  It's a "big" tx by bitcoin standards (over 1btc), which has priority.

It won't get relayed by people runnning the main client without any configuration changes.  People can still configure their client to accept it, it's just that they won't relay it by default.  Additionally, some minors may not accept it because it's considered non-standard.  However, some will, so you just need to find out what their IP addresses are -- most pools will have a list of IPs you can connect to, so just find a pool that accepts non-standard tx's -- and  make sure your client is connected to them.  All clients will accept a blockchain that is valid, it's just that new clients won't relay non-standard tx's that aren't in the blockchain.  But ya once it's confirmed, it's confirmed.
In short, you can still make sure that your transaction goes through, it's just much more of a pain.

Yup.  Every time somebody gets hacked, it's almost always "I was using this super new service" or "my 4 character brainwallet was hacked" or "I don't know how they could have gotten my bitcoins, my Nigerian price uncle sent me this antivirus software to run before I send him my bank account info for that lottery ticket".
I've had a brain wallet for over 2 years.  Hasn't been hacked yet.  Because it's not the fucking first round hash of an 8 character English word.  A "brain wallet" is any way you can remember to reproduce a 32 byte hex number.  It doesn't have to just be sha256(password).  And considering that "mining" brain wallets is a thing, I'd strongly encourage against it.  Oh the most you can remember is six words?  Ok then make your brain wallet something like sha256(sha512(first three words), last three words).  That's still iffy, but it's significantly better than exactly what the bots are searching for:  sha256(six words).  Really though, using a paper wallet is probably going to be by far the better choice than a brain wallet.  But if you have to use a brain wallet, make sure it's a super duper good one.  And remember, you are terrible at making things random.  All those extra periods or long string of qrqrqrqrqr that you think makes your passphrase sneaky-- hackers already know about it... ALL of it.  Unless you include an actual element of randomness spit out by a computer in the creation of your brain wallet, it's likely it will be compromised.
One of the drawbacks of not having any regulating authority means you have nowhere to go for help.  YOU are responsible.

Litecoins, were they the same in the market's eyes as bitcoins, would be worth 1/4 as much, but they're worth less than 1/30.  Clearly they have a place, and it's as a secondary currency, which is GREAT.  It takes load off bitcoin for micro transactions, and it serves as a good insurance and backup against SHA-2 vulnerabilities being found, not that bitcoin wouldn't fork in such an instance.  But litecoin clearly has its place, and there's no reason not to offer it alongside bitcoin.

ya i mean, you are absolutely right that it sucks that this is a problem.  what happens if bitcoin takes over the world and now suddenly as somebody suggested elsewhere, tx's for less than $10 worth are "dust"?  i think that is a legitimate concern, however, i'm not worried about it, because i view this fix as a temporary solution.  gavin isn't stupid, he knows bitcoin needs to be practical and usable if it's going to spread-- and i think this fix was just a temp fix while the community figures out a better solution.  he found a happy medium between keeping bitcoin running smoothly for now and also making sure even as little as $0.01 of value could still be easily moved.  i'm not worried about that 0.01 changing to $10 or something in the future.  i know the devs and community aren't stupid and that one of bitcoin's selling points is micro transactions.  i have confidence the devs and the community will be innovative in ways i cant imagine and find a way to make things work.  bitcoin's time has come.  that's really all there is to it.  some how or another, we'll figure out how to make it work.

Or it means somebody donated some of his newly minted block reward to the bitcoin faucet in an attempt to help spread bitcoin.  A perfectly reasonably thing to do.  This is the type of thing I want to point out to people who say "zomg it's not at all anonymous".  We have ONE transaction and even pointing that to a person who we know is linked with one of the addresses is STILL heavy speculation and easy deniable.  You do just a few more "washes" and complete plausible deniablility in pretty much any circumstance is super easy.

I have money that I have invested in things.  If you want to call that a "portfolio" then go ahead.
But let me explain.  The point of diversification is to mitigate risk.  If one thing goes kaput, you aren't screwed because you are spread out.  However, that **comes at the expense** of lower average returns, because by definition, if you are diversified, your funds are not ALL sitting in the best performing asset.  The purpose of diversifying is nothing more than what gamblers call "bankroll management", but it is NOT geared towards making the most amount of money.
For example, if I have $10,000 and am a winning poker player, I can play low stakes poker and grind out small amounts, say $200, with little risk of ruin, or I can put it all on the line and risk busting, but also have the shot at running it up to $30k or $40k.  The risk in doing so is great, but the potential return is also much much larger, and when you multiply the probability of each event by the potential gain or loss in order to come up with an average net gain, you see that the riskier move has a higher average gain, even though a large amount of the time, you will end up broke.  If I go broke half the time, and win $20K half the time, that's an average of +$10K per time, which is 50x better than winning $200, 100% of the time.  It's clearly a profitable gamble, it's just that it comes with a very high chance of losing my bankroll.
For most people, their "bankroll" is their retirement, or their life's savings, and going broke is completely disastrous, so they should diversify, mitigate their risks, and take much lower gains in return for much smaller fluctuations in their "portfolio".  But for people who are willing to accept much higher risks, diversifying is stupid, and betting everything you can on the highest performing asset you can find is the strategy that yields the highest overall net average profit, even if it means you go bust a lot of the time.
For example, I put about $8K, pretty much everything I had at the time, into bitcoin at about $30.  If it goes to zero, that sucks for me, but I also had a sell order sitting at $375, and if it had hit that before the bubble burst, I'd have $100K, more than 12x my money.  As it stands, when the dust settles, I'll probably have "only" doubled my money.  I could have bought a CD and earned 5% per year, losing out to taxes and inflation, but by god I would have had zero risk of losing it.
Like I said, diversification for diversification's sake is not sound investing strategy.  It depends on what one's goals and threshold for risk are.  Diversification is nothing more than what gamblers call "money management", and it's an entirely separate entity from the actual Expected Value (the net average gain) of a thing.

i did see your other reply, but i simply don't believe you.  besides, it really doesn't matter if you are dustin or not.  if im a theif, all that matters is that i found dustin, who is guaranteed (via the bitcoin-otc signature) to be the owner of an address that has received 77K bitcoins, and which used to regularly receive 2700 btc payments.  that may have been a business and he may not still have most of the money that address received, but the point remains-- he's a worth while target for a thief to scope out.  like i said, i do believe you are him, but in the end, it doesn't really matter.  my purpose in exposing bitcoin's lack of anonymity has been clearly demonstrated.  people need to remember that anonymity which may protect them from "beyond reasonable doubt" in a courtroom is NOT enough anonymity to protect them from an unsavory adversary who is willing to simply take a gamble that you own an address.  different threat models require different security, and "anonymity" is not a binary one-size-fits-all solution.  it is a fluid and flexible term like "security" which encompasses many different levels and degrees.

Potential new users are ALWAYS put off by waiting for the damned blockchain to download, and since that's an integral part of the system and isn't' going away, we need people who want to use bitcoin but don't necessarily care much about perfect security to use lite clients or web wallets.  Anybody introducing bitcoin to others should pretty much avoid talks about mining or the blockchain and point them to web wallets or something.

OP, you seem very resistant to advice.  You keep just trying to justify things.  There is no justification to be had.  The proper thing for you to do is to tell your sister what happened and give her complete control over all the money.  You've already spent your portion and then some.
You have a gambling problem.  You are not an investor.  You can **never** become an investor.  You do not have the mental fortitude to handle fianncial investing.  That's OK-- there's plenty of people who have that same issue-- but that means you need to delegate investing to others.  Any pyacheck you earn you should spend on normal things-- life, food, movies, whatever-- but you cannot invest it.  That's just not something you're capable of.  You must learn to accept this.  Yes, it sucks knowing that there is a way to make money without putting in hours of labor.  It's bad luck that you happen to be a person who cannot do such a thing-- but you can either accept that FACT, or you can continually go broke trying to deny it.  You are a gambling addict, and that's all there is to it.  You deny this at both your own peril and also at the peril of others, like your sister and her college education.  That's pretty shitty of you don't you think?  Wouldn't it just be better to man up, accept yourself including your faults, and do the right thing, for your family's sake as well as your own?
But you wanted investment advice.  Here's investment advice:  Give the money all to your sister.  That's absolutely the best thing you can do as an investor.  It will have a guaranteed positive return.

it empties addresses completely.  so like if you have 4 addresses, call them A1, A2, A3, and A4, and their balances are 2, 5, 40, and 45, and you want to send 6btc to somebody, the transaction will empty out addresses A1 and A2, and ship out the 6 btc to whoever, and then create a new A5 address in your own wallet to ship the remainder 1 btc back into your wallet.  Notice A1 and A2 are now both completely empty.  If you had wanted to send 8btc, it would have emptied A3 or A4 and sent the remainder to a new address.  So like, in the first example, when you sent 6btc, your "wallet" would show 85 btc available to spend, and another 1 btc "waiting for confirmation" for a total balance of 86, and in the second example where you sent 8 btc and emptied the 40btc address, you'd have 52 btc available to spend, and another 32 waiting for confirmation, because it was part of that 8btc transaction, and the entire transaction needs to be confirmed before you can spend the rest of it.
does that make sense?
this emptying addresses feature is an attempt to offset the non-anonymous nature of tracking addresses via the blockchain.  the blockchain is necessary because it's the only way to prevent counterfeit, by having a public ledger that everybody vcan verify and say "yeah this address has this much and i know that for sure because everybody has the same ledger they're using to check that".... but unfortunately, the nature of such a system means that the trial of money is right there for all to see and follow.  so to counter-act this and try to make bitcoin as anonymous as possible, every other measure thinkable was taken to obscure the flow of money.  so if you have 2 btc in A1 and want to send 1btc to your friend at C1, a transaction is made that puts 1 btc in C1 and 1btc in A2, but nobody knows that you are A2-- for all they know A2 is yet a third person, and you were paying two people at once.  even if they know that's not true, they don't know if you're A2 or C1.... (unless you re-use addresses and have associated your IRL identity to one or more of them.)
this is why there are "mixing" services.  you send your money into a pool of other money and get out new coins that came from a giant pool which is near impossible to trace back through.  once again, it's an attempt to make bitcoin as anonymous as possible, while recognizing the necessity of the explicitly non-anonymous nature of the blockchain.  pretty much all of the features of bitcoin attempt to make it as anonymous as possible, because the blockchain is necessary and the glue that holds the whole shebang together.
edit: and notice that it *does NOT* empty more addresses than necessary, once again for anonyminity purposes, to try and make sure that only the minimum number of addresses necessary are linked together.  like in that first example, people might not have known you were A2 but they knew you were A1, so when you make a transaction with inputs A1 and A2, now they know you are very likely also the owner of A2.

Except he's completely wrong, at least about the USA.  The text of the UIGEA specifically outlines provisions for financial institutions to not process payments from gambling websites.  For a player, playing is completely legal, except for a few states which have specifically prohibited it.  All of the poker sites that had their domains and bank accounts seized on "Black Friday" were accused of money laundering and knowingly going against the financial aspects of the UIGEA.  It has been determined at the federal level than online poker does not fall under the 1961 Wire Act.  The reason USA players cannot play on foreign sites is because the foreign sites themselves have stopped allowing US players, because it's simply too much hassle, and they don't want the US trying to come after their bank accounts.  The few sites that remain are all segregated so that USA players can only play with USA players, but they still launder their money to USA-unfriendly nations to prevent bank seizures, which is one of many reasons why Americans have such a hard time getting paid.  They are legally "grey" most recently because a few small laws were just passed which made online poker specifically legal, but with a lot of provisions.  Being the leader of the world in gaming regulations, Nevada had already passed laws for the regulation of online poker in advance that went into effect as soon as federal law allowed it, so now you have Ultimate Poker and the WSOP app real money version (soon), which only allows you to play in Nevada, thus not violating the Wire Act and also now complying with new federal regulations.  Bitcoin sites like Seals With Clubs, are pretty interesting, because honestly, I don't think they care at all what the law is.  Their domain and servers aren't in the USA, the players don't need to keep more than a few buyins on the site -- if they keep anything at all on it -- and the rake the site generates can be moved into cold storage on a daily basis.  Bitcoin simply makes it so they *can't* be seized, whether or not it's illegal.  I think Micon just toots his horn about it because he knows nobody really cares.  I however think the Southern NY DOJ is a loose cannon and not worth provoking.

Yeah, but the inventors and first investors in ANY type of startup usually have this happen, that's simply the reward they get for taking the risk of putting their time and effort and money into something that might just ultimately fail.  HOWEVER, if this still bothers you, you are free to use something like Litecoin, an alt-chain similar to bitcoin, but using different algorithms and announced weeks before it was up and running, so there was no "pre mining" as it's commonly called.  Litecoin is going strong, even if it is in bitcoin's shadow.

there's compiled binaries for namecoind and nmcsocks which opens a local socks proxy and queries your local namecoin instance, so if you have those both running in the background and then set up your browser proxy to use that socks proxy for .bit domains, the integration is completely seamless.  just run namecoin, make sure the blockchain is caught up, run nmcsocks binary, and you're good to go (assuming your proxy configuration is correct).

First of all, I said "be as accurate as possible" -- I did NOT say "add digits beyond significant digits, just to have more digits".  And what do you mean where does the value come from?  It comes from whatever methodology you use to measure things in life!  If it's the age of a rock, it's whatever they use for carbon dating.  It it's engineering it's a friggin ruler!  Where ELSE would measurements come from?

That was a goodbye.  The discussion had already ended.  You made your opinion and the reasons behind it clear, as I did for mine.  Was there more to the discussion you felt was left out?  And how exactly is it pathetic?  I didn't cop out of anything or not address some argument.  And how exactly does "fair enough" make you look stupid?  To me that acknowledges you made a fair point.  You seem to have taken insult where none was intended and implied laziness where none exists.

it's hard to explain to people.  if you don't know the gist of public key cryptography, or why being open source is important, or how money works, or how much your privacy is invaded every single day, you might not understand or care about bitcoin.  but if you DO understand those things, and THEN you read up on what bitcoin is and how it works, it will be *immediately apparent* that it is CLEARLY the future of money. then go watch Mike Hearn's 2012 London talk and read up on other applications of the protocol, and you will understand why all the excitement above and beyond the future of money.  it is the future of commerce and trading itself.
if you DON'T understand the prereq's it's going to be difficult to explain to you and to explain the benefits.  ive had a couple people ask about it, and they just don't understand anything about anything, and no matter how simply i attempt to convey the basic properties of it, they get lost, or they just think it's a pyramid scheme because of the generation rate.  and all i can do is nod and tell them i understand why they think that, and they're wrong, but (in much nicer words) they're too stupid to understand why they're wrong.
bitcoin has a really bad PR problem.  how do you explain the benefits of it when most people don't even know how anything works to begin with.  paypal is magic as far as they are concerned.  why is the bitcoin magic somehow better when paypal goes instantly and bitcoin takes 10 minutes?  bitcoin obviously sucks and is also a pyramid scheme.
it's so frustrating.  it's like-- i WANT to be able to explain it and the benefits to your average joe, because i want him to want to use it, but there's -- there's just no way.  you just get blank stares.  and then, oh god my favorite, when people fight you with their ignorance.  like i was talking about crypto with a guy in another context, and i mentioned AES 256 was really and truly secure, and he fought me tooth and nail and believed deep to his core that the government if they hadn't already cracked it COULD crack it if only they \*really\* tried.
i just.  there's not.  sigh.  facepalm.

THEY might not, *but any bank doing business with them would*.  That's the trouble.  And then all US banks would be hit with regulations regarding any and all interaction with the Native American bank.  So it's not really as useful as you'd think.  But it's not nothing.  All there needs to be is one path from A to B that works, and the more nodes that are secure, the better.

sorry, but that's the truth.  the loss of EV on the dust you lose from your gold coin is far higher than the EV loss of the probability of a random private key being cracked multiplied by any non-zero amount of bitcoin.
your failure to believe this doesn't mean it's not true.
you simply don't comprehend how unlikely it is.

That's because the OpenCoin company stole the name.  The original ripple protocol was [this]( which would be an open source p2p exchange with no new currency, just using contracts between people you trust.  This new thing is an entirely different bastardization which calls itself ripple but which bears no resemblance to what the original system was supposed to be.  This new system just basically made a bunch of "money" called XRP and said "here use these as vouchers" and tried to simply give them value by declaring they had value, aka fiat money.  It is NOT the ripple protocol, it just stole the name "ripple".  The two things are entirely separate, so it's sometimes hard to tell if somebody is talking about the REAL ripple protocol or if they are talking about the bastard company and its XRP money.

This type of thing is why when my poker buddies asked about bitcoin, the first thing I did was spend 15 minutes impressing upon them the importance of re-thinking and re-learning good security practices.  If you aren't security paranoid, you're going to lose your bitcoins.  I told them "You have to realize that bitcoin is uninsured money, and hackers everywhere are going to try to get at it every second of every day. Don't let other people use your computer, don't open e-mail attachments, double-check site URLs before you login.  If you're not careful, it's very possible you'll lose your bitcoins."  They nodded and said they understood, but I know one of them is going to come to me with a sob story sometime soon here.  It sucks because this is a major impedance to adoption, but there's not much that can be done about it.  And people get offended when you tell them you don't trust their security practices.  My dad was very angry and hurt when I wouldn't let him use my laptop on a family trip last year, and I understand why... but at the same time, his bank account password is my birthday....

Bitcoin IS neutral.  Lots of miners already simply drop and don't relay and don't mine SatoshiDice transactions.  If enough miners consider it spam, it'll take forever to confirm and people will get annoyed and stop playing there.  The market will work itself out.  Most people already are going to choose to use Gavin's recommended no-dust update, not because it's dictated but because they actually agree with trying to block what they consider spam.  Bitcoin IS neutral, but that means that if most of the network doesn't want your transaction, you're going to have to pay a nice fee to incentivise them.
