I wouldn't let that deter you at all! There are tons of options out there to help with the compliance burden of running a Bitcoin ATM or more specifically a MSB (money service business). While some options are MUCH more costly (ie. CoinX) and are generally reserved for enterprise level ventures, there are a lot of reasonable solutions out there. 
One route you can look at is partnering with someone on a machine. There are plenty of Bitcoin ATM guys out there who have established networks and are always looking for opportunities to expand. And your position as a shop owner definitely opens you up to more options in that regard.
Here is how I see your situation as a shop owner :
1. You could provide a spot in your location to host someone else's Bitcoin ATM.
   -- This route is probably the easiest. Most of the Bitcoin ATM operators out there are always on the look out for new locations and will many times give you a % revenue share just to host the machine.
2. You could partner directly with a existing Bitcoin ATM operator company.
   -- This route is much more lucrative. There are operators out there who will partner with you on a machine. This option you will have to put up some capital, but your revenue share is generally around 50/50. I know the company ZenBox had a pretty good deal for a while, but I'm not sure if they are still around or doing it anymore.
3. You could become an agent of a principal licensee.
   -- This one is my personal favorite because it puts YOU in charge of how much $$ you want to make! There are a few exchanges and brokerage services that are licensed in the US to run MSBs. Some of these institutions have programs that allow you to become an agent of them under their AML policy. This means that all compliance burden is on the exchange itself which leaves you to focus on marketing and growing your business. Obviously this is the most costly option as it requires you to put up the capital to purchase a machine and provide float capital to keep it running.
All that being said it's definitely worth it. And depending upon what market you are in, it can be VERY worth it. Typical pricing on machines right now is varying between 7-18% markup on exchange rates. I also know that on the LOW end a machine can do $10k in volume a month. And i've seen some on the high end do over $200k a month in volume. I'll let you do the math on that one :)
Anyways, moral of the story is don't let that link above scare you. Bitcoin ATMs FTW!

There is a WAY better 2-way Genesis machine down the road at Jackson's Bar and Grill..... As far as I can tell the machine has had zero down time. Plus it dispenses cash faster than Mt. Gox losing your money :P. None of that bill by bill crap the BitAccess machines have.

The fastest way is definitely with a Bitcoin ATM :D ! And most of the time all it takes is a phone number to use. Plus you get your bitcoin instantly.

There is pretty solid Bitcoin ATM over at Good Vapor Hollywood on Hollywood BLVD. It is pretty close to the old Locali one and I have had ZERO issues with it. I did notice another machine next door at a computer repair shop, but that thing SUCKED !

Bitcoiners need to stop worrying about the 'Why' wrt to the price move....just look at the chart, it tells the whole story.  And as far as exchanges not providing more details on their customer orders, of course they aren't going to provide the general public with that information.  If I was a large trader and one of my exchanges shared my position, I would close my account immediately.
