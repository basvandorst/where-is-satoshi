In your fav linux you can create a bash function of this sort:
function btceur(){ curl -s  | python -c "import json, sys; print json.load(sys.stdin)['bpi']['EUR']['rate']"; }
function btcusd(){ curl -s  | python -c "import json, sys; print json.load(sys.stdin)['bpi']['USD']['rate']"; }
Credit goes to someone else, I unfortunately do not remember where I stole this from.

Dude could've at least checked [wikipedia]( before declaring the end of hacking.

I highly doubt any nation is willing to give up all that power, the only exception would be very small nations that don't have it in the first place. At most nations might start creating their own cryptocurrencies.

Isn't this a bit like giving up on politics' ability to manage the world and just accepting the superiority of markets? Technology might not need democratic consent but it needs the consent of the markets after all.

Yes of course, turn the computer into a neo-television because of the enormous problem caused by some of the small businesses in the black market being made visible to everyone.

I think you're overestimating the drug warriors knowledge of computer security. If SR was involved in terrorism then they might have to really worry about their security but since they deal just in drugs I bet that the only thing they have to worry about is being infiltrated by undercover agents.

As usual the greatest threat to criminals on the internet is other criminals on the internet rather than the government.

What is the incentive for the FBI? Silk Road is pretty small business and low profile. Does the FBI even do stuff like fake sales?  
The only incentive I can think of is some senators who made a fuss but eh, I think you overestimate how much people care about drugs.

I've for long thought of money as a loan from the people with the nukes, over which we can squabble while they keep the power. To that end I think it's nation states and military institutions that should be reformed rather than just monetary policy.

The drop is because of ExchB closing down. Perhaps because of USSS pressure? Whatever the reason I think the price should recover as new exchanges that offer the same ease of use open up, I'm keeping an eye on cryptoexchange.com

Should be blockchain blocks instead.
