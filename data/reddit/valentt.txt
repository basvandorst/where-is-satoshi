So when is Bitcoin Cash getting Lighting Network?
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:29:14
I use GreenAddress and manually set to 1mBTC pet kB which turns out to be around $4 per transaction and it is very fast.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:53:05
Friend wanted to see what this Bitcoin thing is all about.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:16:00
All other alternative coins only have low fee because they aren’t used no where as close as Bitcoin. Ethereum being only exception and it’s fees also rose when people started using Crypto Kitties.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:05:27
Are you willing to send 2$ to my segwit address as a test? And I’m going to send back $1.5 back to you.

They asked Roger Ver twice what it the solution for scaling Bitcoin Cash, first he didn't respond, just gave his rehearsed "blah blah bitcoin core is shit, bcash is real bitcon" answer and when they repeated the question he said scaling solution is Lighting Network. Amazing, what a two-faced douchebag.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:01:17
I don’t have other cryptos. I only have Bitcoin for now in my wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:28:02
Yes, I know Roger Ver is a douchebag.

Please consider [MeshPoint](  - an open source project that is building wifi router for disaster relief. 
I’m project leader of MeshPoint, AMA or check out our Hackaday project page -

That is what I did! I choose “Economy” mining fee, it was estimated at $37, “Low priority” which is lowest setting was estimated at $35. So I choose Economy. But as soon as I sent it and checked block explorer it showed transaction fee of $80!!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:18:01
Richard Ver is such a pompous douchebag!
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:53:13
No. They have commercials and should not ask for donations.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:17:02
Please elaborate where have we met? 
And why are you saying this? If I didn’t care about helping people in need I would have never started this project.
I was three times in Munich CCC hackerspace showing progress of project and looking if there are people interested to join this project. Did we meet there?
This is fully open source project so there is no way any single person can benefit from this. We have intentionally kept everything fully open source.
If my goal was to get money I could have gotten it many times - but all investors only understand parents and proprietary projects. That is why this project has been self financed by me so far - to keep it fully open source to the core.
You can see all of our progress and what we did in last two years. Also our team members are also now contributing to Lede and OpenWrt projects.
So again I’m kindly asking you to explain where we met.
If you have been in middle of crisis situation with thousands where refugees that were arriving were totally lost and didn’t know where they arrived and where they were going because complete 3G and LTE infrastructure failed so they couldn’t use their phones to open google maps or to let their friends and families know they are alright.
We can give anyone who is interested contacts from humanitarian organisations that we worked with to provide free Wi-Fi to check with them if we charged them anything or if we volunteered and helped then with providing free Wi-Fi.
Some of organisations that we helped are Red Cross, Greenpeace, Jesuit Rescue Service, Mountain Rescue Service, Refugees Welcome and lots of small NGOs.
I can provide contacts form all of these organisations for anyone interested in double checking anything what we did and if we did this as volunteers or not.

Which wallet do you recommend? Mycelium was highly recommended, but it has failed me today. Also before you send there is no confirmation showing you real tranaction fee, you only see what is fee after it is already too late. Do any wallets show you real fee before you send transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:02:58
Are there mining pools that support Segwit? Does Slush pool supports Segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:02:15
I have ASIC miner, how can I make it to mine my own transaction? Is there some tutorial?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:14:29
I don’t have any kind od slider...
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:24:49
I have never been to Berlin. I never asked or received a penny for anything I did for refugees.
Why are you spreading these lies? Who are you?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:59:01
Second transaction was even worse, but I blame Mycelium wallet for completely estimating wrong transaction fee.
Other friend wanted me to send him $200, and Mycelium wallet showed that economy fee (second slowest option) fee will be $35 but when I send funds fee was $80 !!!
We both were shocked! How is it possible for Mycelium wallet to miss completely how much fee is going to cost and by factor of 2.5x ?!?

Research is definitely a must have, you have excellent knowledge about charitable organisations my hat goes off to you sir.
There are lots of awesome project that just don’t have marketing people or don’t care about marketing and they get crushed by charity gorillas that get all the media space and spend enormous amounts of funding on marketing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:03:53
I have segwit wallet but currently it is empty. I’m going to transfer some funds to it but only when fees come down a bit. Thanks for this tip.
@_date: 2018-08-17 06:05:12
If that is close to truth then Bitcoin is doomed.
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:03:38
Ok, for [btc.com]( there are no Unknown mining pools:
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:46:32
How come some agregators then count full 100% without “Unknown” ones? Check out btc.com stats for example.
@_date: 2018-08-17 06:47:55
You are delusional, with so much money on the table there is no way they are leaving. But I have the same sentiment.
@_date: 2018-08-17 06:01:40
Then they must have some proprietary hardware that others do not have.
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:07:13
And [coin.dance]( has "Other" cathegory: [
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:57:50
@_date: 2018-08-17 06:04:01
No, other pool statistics tools show no unknown and claim they account all 100% of hash power... 
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:45:08
What are the risks?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:45:31
So when do you think LN goes live?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:32:31
Bitcoin Cash CEO has forbidden using Segwit and Lighting network technologies. Please read his statement at Bitcoin Cash web site.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:48:29
Why? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:16:25
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:34:53
Is Lighting Network still at least 18 months out? This info was provided during live Bitcoin conference. Was that an official statement, as official as we can expect from decentralised group of developers?
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:46:32
I have a segwit address and it starts with 3.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:20:52
Is Lightning Network Bitcoin Cash’s Kryptonite?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:00:16
Why 18 months after 2018 Q1?
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:17:22
Core is not a single entity, and attributing what one dev said to all of them is intellectually flawed. There is bunch of shit some of devs said and others disagreed, and also is true with high fees.
I rather think it is much more plausible that they don’t have a solution that scales and both doesn’t make Bitcoin more centralised. So they choose less of two evils, while trying to solve other issue. 
It is possible that they may never find a solution.... anything is possible.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:11:45
I have no idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:07:46
Can I sell my 2X coins right afrer the fork on Bittrex or will I have to wait?

Can I sell my 2X coins right afrer the fork on Bittrex or will I have to wait?
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:26:28
So what does this actually mean? How and when can we start using Lighting network?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:30:47
Bottleneck has been created by greedy miners who want more control.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:07:26
Very interesting answer, but using that analogy almost all cryptocurrencies have score or 100.
I’m looking more at long term picture of how cryptocurrency project or whole ecosystem is resistant to censorship.
By your definition we could have some cryptocurrency project managed and developed by a single developer and at protocol and transaction level we have perfect resistance - but what happens if that person gets bit by a bus?
Today most censorship attack aren’t done at technology level because it is much easier to attack wetware. Just send someone to threaten people or hit them over the head with a stick...
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:52:39
Bitcoin has 80% of total hash rate in last 3h, seams that attack has failed!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:08:14
Can I sell my 2X coins right afrer the fork on Bittrex or will I have to wait?
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:51:45
Great answer! So the more blocks are full miners earn more money on fees because of bidding for space in the blocks? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:47:46
Centralisation would be even worse with 2MB blocks, so this attack would be even more effective. Attack is now ending, they have their best shot but Bitcoin is still here.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:51:49
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:15:00
I have been tracking my own fees in last two months and my fees are in range $5-8 which is too expensive for most transactions because I’m not Bitcoin millionaire.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:27:22
If BCH wins, which is highly doubtful, it will take down all other currencies with same tactics that was now used on Bitcoin. You think that what would stop after successfully dethroning Bitcoin? They would attack all other currencies as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:22:42
I have S7 miner
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:22:08
But it is too expensive for small transacrions. Currently I earn 50$ pre week mining Bitcoin but I pay 15% of that to get it transferred into my wallet. That is too expensive! 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:10:09
Just installed GreenAddress, seams nice.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:51:57
Not sure how to interpret this graph. Are block less full now that segwit is activated?
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:00:09
So what you are saying Bitcoin is too big to fail? This is a bad argument and proven to be false in much larger scenarios... I would like to see Bitcoin be secure but also to not have always full blocks and lower fees. I now loose 15% on 0.01BTC transactions due to fees :(
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:25:56
Right now I'm on Slush pool. Any suggestions for a better one? My only must have feature is for poll to have both Android and IOS app that shows me status of my miner.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:04:45
What is the answer when people claim that Bitcoin is controlled by Bilderberg Group? Because Bielderberg owned company invested money into Blockstream. How false is that statement? 
I just see some people repeat it over and over but I see no response that clarifies the situation.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:27:06
Why? Any risk involved?
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:31:22
Who is attacking segwit? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:47:20
Thanks! I semi-automatically pay my electric bill from that wallet so extending frequency of payment is not really an option.
I'll look into Bitcoin core wallet. Are there any other GUI based soft or hardware wallets that I can use?
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:23:14
Any suggestions?
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:16:56
I’m not seeking donations. Go to our project web page and you will see there is no donation page.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:16:09
I’m not seeking donations yet! I’m trying to get information how to start doing so! There is a huge difference.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:18:27
What I’m seeking is information.
