"True" market price is a tough one, as that implies the market is perfectly liquid and transparent. That's obviously not the case for bitcoin. In the US stock market, a decent approximation is available since exchanges are forced by law to communicate with eachother to provide "best" price to buyers/sellers. Achieving higher levels of liquidity/transparency in digital currency markets would surely boost acceptance, usage and value.

Glad you asked.
Our company is run by Wall Street veterans, on both tech and business sides. To some this may sound like a negative, but if you think about the business model of an exchange, you realize it's a strong positive differentiator for our company. We mean to serve professionally and stay in business for the long run.
Our technology platform is mature and has processed millions of daily trades in traditional markets for years.
We will soon post articles explaining this in detail. Feel free to contact us directly with any questions: info

That's fine. You will still be entered to win a membership. The day you want to actually take advantage and trade, you will have to provide a certain amount of personal information. This may or may not include SSN. This is the cost of doing business legally in the United States.
