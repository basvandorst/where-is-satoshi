So in other words, you can't come up with such a definition, and have to resort to name-calling.

The comments online about this program seemed fishy/spammy, and upon further investigation, it seems that it connects to somewhere on the internet, which makes me feel like it might be stealing all of your bitcoins once it solves it.
I'll stick with something less sketchy.

Sure, but I don't see any reason to use a log scale there. It's just visually misleading.
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:58:14
Oh, really? Well that solves my problem then. Thanks.
EDIT: I see the documentation, but I don't see anything in it specific to wallet password recovery. Any idea where to find that part specifically?

Seriously though. Find a definition of debt that makes dollars debt.

Global drug trade only totals around[ $330 billion per year]( which is less than 1 billion per day. Furthermore, many of those transactions are not conducted in US dollars.
So millions of USD per day is probably more correct than billions.

It looks like John the Ripper is going to be faster than that in terms of passwords per second, and I think (I hope) I've finally gotten that figured out.
Thanks for your help, though!

Right. So Treasury Bills represent debt, because the holder is owed money by the treasury. But I don't think that makes dollars debt. Dollars just happen to be the denomination of money that is owed to holders of a Treasury Bill.
Of course, I agree that dollars *come about* as a result of debt, but that's not the same thing.
@_date: 2014-09-21 03:09:46
Ugh. People are dumb.
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:33:39
I feel like they used a log scale there just to make it seem way worse than it is.

Does it, though? If I have a dollar bill, it doesn't mean that anybody owes me anything.

@_date: 2014-08-17 03:01:27


Can you cite a source for that?


@_date: 2014-05-04 05:27:34


What you're saying is that a dollar is a *result* of debt. That's not the same as a dollar *being* debt. I can't say "this dollar represents x entity's obligation to give me y."
@_date: 2014-10-08 23:33:09
I think the capitalization was for emphasis. Like "Have you ever explained *fiat* to people?"
@_date: 2014-05-04 04:36:09
I'm still just as confused, if not moreso. I don't really see how Treasury Bonds' existence affects the nature of the dollar.


I didn't. Can you explain more how this works?


Federal Reserve Notes are printed by the [Bureau of Engraving and Printing]( which is a part of the Treasury Department, and this is done under the [Federal Reserve Act]( which is an act of Congress. So isn't "Congress printing bills via the Treasury" exactly what's going on?
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:08:18
Of course I know what debt is, but I didn't want to just assert my definition of debt without giving you a chance to defend your position.
The definition that I'm working with is basically what Wikipedia has: "A debt is an obligation owed by one party (the debtor) to a second party, the creditor." By this definition, if I have a dollar, it's not debt. It's not owed to anyone.
I've been trying to give you chances to justify your position, and you've responded with name-calling. If that's how we're going to conduct this argument, it's you who is a "fucking moron," because in the face of critical discussion, all you seem to be able to do is parrot your original assertion and get angry.
@_date: 2014-09-13 16:11:44
Yeah, as bitcoin becomes more popular, I'd imagine that most of the less tech-savvy people will opt for online wallets (and for good reason. I wouldn't trust Grandma to know how to back up her wallet.)
And I'm not sure the average person is going to *want* multisig. Bitcoin is complicated enough already for someone who isn't particularly good with technology.

Is it the banks' fault that people misunderstand the nature of bank accounts, though?
And furthermore, it essentially *does* function as a storage unit, because if you want to withdraw your money, you can. The bank isn't like "oops, we don't have it anymore."

I was only able to crack it because my password was something like "Onceupon4t1m3" and I knew it was some variation of "once upon a time." If I hadn't remembered that, there would have been no chance of me cracking it.
The number of possibilities I had to try numbered in the high tens, whereas if someone was trying to crack a password with no prior knowledge, the number of reasonable possibilities is in the billions or trillions.
This is especially limited by the fact that even a fast computer is still only going to be able to guess 50 passwords per second. My computer got around 4 guesses per second per core (that's with other stuff running, though).
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:12:31
This program tries to connect to somewhere on the internet, which makes me feel like it might be stealing all of your bitcoins once it solves the password. I'd avoid this.

Yeah, it would probably be a better use of that money to invest it somewhere.

It seemed to me more that I asked a different question, and you gave the answer to my previous question.
Seriously, just give me a definition of debt.

Living in a world that's easy to exploit also means that it's easier to be exploited. In a chaotic world, only the strongest/luckiest/most cunning psychopaths will survive.
Whereas in a stable world, every psychopath can abuse the generosity of their neighbors and such without in turn getting abused all the time.

But the point here is that ultimately, the biggest security flaw in apple's centralized model is the fact that users are stupid and will fall for phishing attacks and create guessable secret questions. User stupidity is what caused the celebrity photo leaks.
You're implying that bitcoin is safer. In the context of attacks on a central location, this is true, because bitcoin has no central location to attack (unless you count a 50% attack). But in this discussion, that's sort of a red herring, because the security flaw that we're discussing is user stupidity.
In the context of stupid users, bitcoin is actually *less* safe than a centralized model: There is no recourse for a person who falls for a bitcoin phishing attack. Their bitcoins are just gone forever. In contrast, if a person who falls for a credit card phishing attack notices and reports fraudulent charges in time, they aren't held liable for them, and don't actually lose any money.

I don't really think it makes sense to compare Apple pay to bitcoin.
Apple pay is a method of transferring various currencies, such as dollars. It's like having a credit card in your phone.
Bitcoin is a currency that you can transfer between computers. It's like having real money in your phone.

Hmm. I suppose you're right. Still, I think my more general argument still stands.
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:34:40
How can we really know whether it deters incompetence or not?
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:21:57
Sure they can. Most people consider there to be certain inalienable rights, but there are also purely legal rights that only exist in certain jurisdictions.
Like, the right to bear arms exists in US law, but it doesn't exist in some other countries, and if you go to those other countries and ask "hey, do you have the right to bear arms?" people will be like "no, that's not a thing here."
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:43:43
It depends on whether they're quoting the actual law there, or summarizing the intended target of the law. But it does seem like they're quoting from the law, so I think you're probably right.
@_date: 2014-11-08 09:36:44

The use of the Silk Road Marketplace to *actually purchase things* (which is the whole point of a "marketplace") was *almost always* a crime, because most of the things sold on the site were illegal.
Obviously just *browsing* the site wasn't illegal, but that's beside the point, because it's [pretty clearly not what we're talking about here](
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:55:48
What exactly is the "this" that you think bitcoin didn't enable? Because I doubt buying drugs on the internet was as safe or widespread before bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:32:52
Are you serious? You've been given nothing but straight answers. *Bitcoin enables people to safely buy illegal drugs on internet marketplaces.* That never would have happened without bitcoin.
Don't get me wrong, I think the darknet markets are awesome. But let's not pretend that they're intended for legal activities.
@_date: 2015-04-01 03:48:44
Only if you're being deliberately obtuse. We all know a vast majority of the activity on the Silk Road was illegal.

You would never actually want to loan it out for no interest, because you take on the risk that it will never be payed back, and you could just hold on to it yourself and let it gain value without taking that risk. Let's say that 1% of your loans are never paid back. You'd want to charge enough interest to at least cover the 1% loss that you average on loans.
