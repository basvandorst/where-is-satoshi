I'm aware, and I don't have a problem with that, but I don't think the solution is an immediate and permanent ban.

Oi! I sent an email to Coinbase support ages ago. My account got closed for no reason (other than maybe because i logged in from Israel?) and y'all aren't helping. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:19:53
Maybe just lock the account?! Prevent me from doing anything until I get back to the states? Account closure is a little much.

I've had my account for over a year, with identity verified and bank attached and everything, and as soon as i log in from Israel (whereas I was in the US before), bam: Banned. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 08:08:02
Yes, thankfully. I was pissed though because I was going to buy a substantial amount of BTC, as at the time it was ~$500, and I was sure it'd bounce back.

Literally just talked about [mindfulness]( in English class today.

Wish I had held I to the twelve I gambled away, lol
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:17:05
I wasn't attempting to...I tried to order 10 exactly.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:54:32
About 10 BTC or about $10 BTC?

Getting a message telling me I can't ship to the US...
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:37:04
Fuck, I missed it?
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:50:50
Yea, right.
@_date: 2016-06-06 08:30:48
Nope, &gt;$4k down already.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:42:34
Not to mention that his 200 BTC is all in alts, so he won't have gotten any BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:56:16
+50 doge
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:02:11
No fucking way
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:17:52
Why start a fight? It's just rude, and I'm not even a BCH supporter.
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:43:59
PayPal is worse - they allow you to do the transactions, then screw you when people dispute the payments.
@_date: 2017-04-26 12:55:01
boi I see you 
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:01:32
Exactly why I thought it was relevant.

I thought replay protection just prevented someone from using information from transactions on one chain to repeat them (to some degree) on the other (whichever one is "behind?") 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:18:53
To be fair, your comment was deeply misleading.

- Don't tug on Superman's cape
- Don't spit into the wind
- Don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
- Don't mess around with Jim
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:32:58
I wish they'd spell correctly...
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:30:16
You should really put this up on something like medium (or share it with a real newspaper), where it can be more easily shared and more widely viewed. Whenever people make the claim that Bitcoin is solely used for criminal activities, I always cite Venezuela as evidence against it, but struggle with real-world examples. This is a perfect example of a legitimate use of Bitcoin and I love it, I'm just disappointed that it has to come in response to such inhumane conditions. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:57:47
Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:48:41
I guess the better question is, then, why does logging in once from another country warrant a closure, and why won't support respond to me, ever? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:53:17
You've succeeded! 
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:42:40
Yea, they let me sweep my coins into another wallet (luckily I already have a Ledger Nano)
