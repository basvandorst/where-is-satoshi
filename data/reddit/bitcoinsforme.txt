I don't even understand why someone would have created this video...

Mostly true, though using actual cash requires physical contact and removes a layer of anonymity.

Everyone Dem I have talked to and had them seriously think about the concept is pro second amendment.  Sure, they don't want people having tanks and missile launchers, but they see the point.  Additionally, with 3D printing, soon it is going to be a moot point anyways.
The problem is that very few people listen and the ones who do don't speak up on either side.

As someone who is pro-government, pro-regulation, Bitcoin interests me for a number of reasons.
First, The government should have come up with an electronic, feeless (or at least heavily discounted from CC transaction costs) system over a decade ago.  If the US Treasury had done it, not only would it have been a huge boon to small businesses, but they could have established the dominate electronic currency base that could have been used worldwide.  As I see it, the main reason they didn’t do it was the credit card companies.
Because they didn’t do it, there has been a vacuum where it should have been.  It makes perfect sense that something would form to fill its place.
Second, While I approve of government regulation, I don’t approve of corporate regulation.  The fact that the credit card companies and paypal effectively get to choose who you do business with and can suspend or seize funds on a whim bothers me.
Finally, While I am pro-regulation, I also know that regulation has its limits and places.  There are bad governments out there (and unfortunately, more often than I would like, the US is one of them).  There are bad policies and individuals need to maintain a certain amount of independent power.
This is why, as a progressive, liberal democrat I believe deeply in the second amendment.  The government should fear the outrage and contempt of the people.

No, the government rules me at my sufferance because I want the benefits of being ruled.  Part of the the balance between individual freedom and governed rule is independent power.  Independent power has been on the decline for many years.  It is my hope that bitcoin will increase independent power.

We are looking to buy 780 bitcoins in the next two weeks and I know we would much rather deal with a person we meet in a bank then transferring money.

Maybe you could do it that you return 50%-75% of the fee's after 90 days.  So, ultimately it is cheep, but you are protected in the short term.
Edit: Forgot to say I would be interested.

Does that invalidate anything I said?

I am fine with corporations setting their own terms of use.  I have a problem when the collude to prevent competition and limit my choices through monopoly.
Bitcoin or something like it is the natural progression of our level of technology, the costs of communication and the quality of choices available to us.
If there had already been a cheep, one-way, reliable method of transferring currency, than I doubt bitcoin would have anywhere close to the traction it does now.
That it is so complicated to buy bitcoins in the US is proof that we don't have such a system already.

When regulatory capture is used towards profiteering and limitation of service, then yes I have an issue with it.  When it is done to impose minimum standards and establish necessary services, than no.

They didn't have to invent anything.  It was there, it was talked about, it was killed.
We should have done it, because we didn't someone else did.  That isn't a blame game.  That is just how it happens.  If you don't act, someone else eventually will.

On NPR they mentioned that some states do not require intent on their anti-structuring laws.
In fact, normal cash businesses have been prosecuted for no other reason than appearing to structure.
