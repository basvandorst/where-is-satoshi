I might be wrong since am really new to this... But I've read that once you use the address digitally either to send or receive, it loses the 100% security which means its not completely safe, so yes, best thing to do is to have a cold wallet (paper wallet) if you're saving bitcoins, once you use this address might be at risk too, so be careful with that.
