I'm with you on this, mods of r/bitcoin need to be more vigilant and strict to delete or ban people who aren't here to teach or learn

Open an account with coinbase.com as well as an exchange from which you can choose many, I recommend bittrex.com. You will have to link your bank account to coinbase to make the deposit from dollar to bitcoin, then look up how to transfer your newly privatized purchased bitcoin to your bittrex account. From there you can own from many different cryptocurrancies and trade for a profit. If you do turn a profit you can send it back to your coinbase account and deposit it into your bank.

Weird, it used to for my cousins in Montreal. I noticed it changed a lot regarding limit withdrawals and authentications.

The fork will be he creation and credit of Bitcoin2X [symbol B2X] equal to the amount of Bitcoin you hold in that wallet.

It happened when Bitcoin forked into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (another cryptocurrency). We were credited equal amounts for free just for having Bitcoin in the Coinbase wallet. The Bitcoin segwit fork is expected to occur tonight at 6-8AM American Pacific Time.

Exactly, it is supposed to occur any hour now. Bitcoin has the ability to skyrocket in value if it breaks the $8000 ceiling which is why it is a good time to enter still. I even bought more bitcoin last night. But if it crashes then all the alternative coins (other cryptocurrencies) should see huge gains. You can monitor those currencies on an exchange like Bittrex.com

- set up an account with a digital wallet account (I use coinbase.com) 
- set up an account with a cryptocurrency exchange site (I use bittrex.com)
- send your newly purchased bitcoin on coinbase.com to your bittrex.com account via unique address codes and begin trading, good luck!
