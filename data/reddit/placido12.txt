Are you talking about or I don't actually know

No business is going to do that, don't be stupid

No. Don't do this. You won't be able to catch the crash in time and even if you do, judging by the events of today, the exchanges will probably be down and you'll have no way to sell as the price free falls. Either set a goal and sell at that point no matter what, or keep on holding for the long run.

Do have any evidence, any at all, that they've been "assimilated", other than you have a hunch they might? It seems like you don't, and without proof this post is worthless. Please stop with the baseless conspiracy theories

What you just said sounds a lot like racism a century ago.

stop bullying me china!

You honestly don't think it's going to crash? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:37:37
Yes, you can, but is anyone really doing that? The overwhelmingly vast majority aren't spending any coins.
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:30:41
Wow this like something out of an post
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:49:04

He doesn't think bitcoin is the future and is bound to become adopted by the government as it's new fiat? BURN HIM
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:46:45
I'm with you on this one. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:01:44
Same. Bought .2 BTC today, hoping that the market keeps this trend going until friday when I actually get my coin :)

How is it "definitely true"? If you have no proof or evidence, then don't make assumptions. Simple as that

If you know an address you can find the balance of that address
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:09:59
How is that related at all? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:12:39
 on freenode

Coinbase seems to be the preferred exchange around here. You might want to look into that.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:59:21
So, you're saying that a 20% discount is going to scare people away because it's "marketing" but a 5-10% discount is going to draw them in?
What the fuck?
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:21:40
You have no idea if that's true. You're literally talking out your ass.
