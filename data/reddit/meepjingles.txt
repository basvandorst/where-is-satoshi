I️ mean I️t follows the white paper more closely so by definition it’s more bitcoin than bitcoin core is. You can argue that bitcoin core is better and the right way to go but you’ve changed bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash has stayed more true to original vision.

It’s not a very good currency at the moment.

Check out r/BTC if you like the idea of a currency. Bitcoin is used as a store of value now a days.

Sure. Low fees and fast transaction is a scam. Wtf? This isn’t a sports team where you hate the rival. Pick the better tech

If BCH can do what BTC can do but cheaper, why wouldn't you use it instead? This assumes you are converting BCH instantly to cash. If you're trying to hold onto the coins in hopes they go up, that is a different story.

Too bad tether couldn't keep it above 8k.

What logic? First off, no ATM costs $19 to use. In Vegas the most you will see would be around 10 and that's not normal. And knowing about how high transactions fees are in the first place doesn't make it fine. It just prevents people from using Bitcoin.

BTC should be able to do both. Be a store of value and a useful currency. A one stop shop. People don't want to carry multiple currencies.

You're just making claims without evidence. Like saying violent video games cause violence in kids. Sounds good at first but it's just not the case. It takes two seconds to tell someone there is bitcoin and bitcoin cash. They will understand. Are people confused about Ethereum and Ethereum classic? No.

It's a scam.

But is it? I really don't know. I've heard many times that it is claimed to be 18 months away from now but it has been claimed to be 18 months away, 18 months ago. Like it's always 18 months away. Lets say it is release in 18 months, that's a long time. User adoption is picking up fast for crypto and most normal people will not pay such fees to use BTC.

This is because the adjustment works by looking at how long it takes to mine 144 blocks. The target is to mine 144 blocks in 24 hrs which would be a block every 10 min. Because blocks were being mined too fast before this new DAA activated, the time it took to mine the last 144 blocks is under 24 hrs which is why the difficulty is higher right now making BTC more profitable to mine. But once the new DAA has been activated for a couple days it will stabilize, or at least that's the idea. It hasn't even been activated 24 hrs yet so it's using blocks that were before the DAA to calculate difficulty.
