I just checked my 25 paper wallets. Everything ok. So I guess that's 25 confirmations more.

Around 5K
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:38:49
How about this? 
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:57:45
Here in Finland you can pay also basically any of your bills using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:15:25
Over 9000
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:36:38
Yes. 2 of them.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:43:54
Well I HAD some bitcoin. Some of it went to buy that building and almost the rest went to pay taxes (30%) I have never had a lot of bitcoins as I think everyone can see from the condition of the house.. :P
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:23:12
They were full of trash. Old furniture an stuff. One vault was used as a cellar so there were old moldy food and shit like that. :P
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:35:11
That is correct. I have'nt took a picture of it myself.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:12:41
Heheh, well yes I sold some of my bitcoins and the rest went to pay taxes. (30% in Finland) I've never had a lot of bitcoins and this was like my "cash out" -moment. If someone would want to rob me, he should rob a refridgerator that was in the bank. I think that it is the most valuable item there. (And now there is even food inside!!) :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:27:11
Yes that is correct. There have'nt been any banking activity in many, many years anymore. So basically it's just an old house.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:50:25
I'm turning its vault into a sleeping alcove. Sleeping = more valuable than money. I think I'll name it "Vault 101".
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:52:50
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:03:48
Haha yeah. As you can see there are 2 garages. One for my blue lambo and another one for my wifes red lambo. (Just kidding, I don't have lambos... ...or wife.)
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:53:56
Oh, haha! Yeah, got it. (googled it too) :D
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:52:10
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:03:43
Haha! Will consider that!
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:21:53
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:38:15
Yes I'm keeping the vaults. They are both open but the keys are missing. :( Even the previous owner said that he has never seen the keys. He had used one of the vaults to store clothes and the other one as a cellar for food.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:17:44
Well it basically is an old dirty cabin. It is just used in banking in fifties -sixties or something like that.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:31:05
Well, not much to rob from that "bank" anymore. :D Previous owners would be better targets, they got my money now. :P
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:32:25
Haha, yeah, especially old ones. :D And like "Crazy Tony's ol' Murderin' Shed", like someone said in r/buttcoin. :D
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:35:32
Yes it is.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:29:39
No it does'nt. :((
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:00:33
Oh I will! When there is some progress in renovation. At the moment there really is'nt much to show. :P
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:33:00
This didn't cost even close to 100k.. :P Actually it was one of the cheapest houses in Finland.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:18:07
Yes, 2 of them. They are open but no keys. :(
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:19:59
It is from Finland.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:20:22
I am not at the bank at the moment so no I can't. But there was nothing much to see. Mostly trash. Few old furniture and construction materials. Vault was used by previous owner as a walk-in wardrobe.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:14:48
It is an OLD bank. I don't know when the banking activity itself has stopped there. Propably 30-50 years ago or something like that. But the banking hall and the vaults are still in place. It has also worked as a post office.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:47:19
I don't know? I don't speak english as my native language. I just used google translate.
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:08:17
Not much. It is in very poor condition and needs a shitload of work. It was actually so cheap anyone here could have bought it. :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:24:59
Well, I don't have lots of coins. I've never had lots and this was like my "cash out" moment and I think anyone can tell from the picture, that there is'nt nothing much to rob. :D
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:20:34
Yeah. :D
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:08:33
No they are'nt. It just looks like it from that angle. But they are pretty close. Those lines are maybe 5-10 meters from the house. :(
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:33:49
Here in Finland it's easy. You just sell your bitcoins with bittiraha.fi and they send euros to your bank account. Then you just pay taxes and that's it. Or this is at least what I did. I don't know what you mean by "large amounts" but bittiraha's maximum is 100 000€. (This bank did'nt cost even close to it) :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:29:31
That's a great idea, but needs a lot work. Door itself weights many hundred kilos and only removing it is a problem.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:37:38
It did not cost even close to 100k. But yes it is gonna need a lot of time and money to repair. And I don't have neither of those because I go to work and my pay is'nt so good so I think it's going to take a lot of time to finish.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:30:36
I'd rather not answer that, but because of its age and poor condition, it was'nt much.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:23:51
Yes, the vaults = safes. They are like small rooms or big safes with thick steel/concrete doors/walls and big locks like you see on cartoons. And they are both open. :)
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:12:52
I'd rather not tell that, but because it is old (built in fifties) and needs a lot of work, it was pretty cheap.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:28:06
Hmm... That might be fun. But I think many of the previous owners have done it already. This building has been used for a residence for many many years.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:59:23
Yeah, why not. My alcoves, my rules.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:42:03
Yeah but there is so much to do that the locks to vaults are not the No. 1 on the to-do-list.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:49:27
Thanks. :)
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:52:27
Well it is in very poor condition and needs a shitload of work.. :( Houses that are ready to live in cost much much more in here too.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:40:47
Yeah, correct.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:46:08
Yes. That's why I'm going to jam doors open permanently by chaining them into wall or welding hinges in place.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:55:15
I don't know exactly yet, but propably turn it into a 4 room apartment (for rent) and 2 room holiday apartment (for myself).
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:10:17
Propably turn it into a 4 room apartment (for rent) and 2 room holiday apartment (for myself).
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:34:22
No, I withdraw all at the time. This was so cheap, my bank did'nt ask anything because there have'nt been much more money on my bank account than my regular pay from work.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:58:20
This is an old picture. 2016 I think. And yes, three feet of snow at the moment.. :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:20:15
Probably yes, and will take a lot of time since I don't have the money to hire any construction workers and will have to do everything by myself.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:40:31
I've always wanted to buy some cheap building. Old railwaystation, school, farm or something like that for renovation. Now I just found this and it was close enough and I had the money. So why not. :)
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:39:56
No thy dont these days. This has been used as as a bank in fifties.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:21:10
Bought at $12. Still hodling.
@_date: 2013-08-08 05:58:02
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:52:08
European up. Since it looks like bitcoin has not made me a millionaire yet, I'd better go to work. :(
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:35:25
How many people do you think even own bitcoins? 1 out of 50 or more? I don't think so...
@_date: 2013-11-04 07:07:11
Where's To The Moon-guy when you need him?
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:18:42
Same here in Finland. Bitcoin would be bittikolikko if translated in finnish but we just use "bitcoin"
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:51:57
Does this help? 
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:53:14
@_date: 2013-08-06 21:19:13
Try Catalyst 11.11, it worked for me.
@_date: 2013-07-29 03:13:47
It is as easy in Finland too. And in Finland you can now pay your bills with bitcoin too.
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:52:08
Voted x 6!
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:30:21
We have been awake in Finland for several hours already.
@_date: 2013-03-23 06:34:32
Yes. But on the other hand - when bitcoins are harder to get for most of the people by mining -&gt; value of bitcoin -&gt; ?????????? ;)
