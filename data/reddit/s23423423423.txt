yeah.. I was also wondering if it would be different if bitcoinica had done what bitfloor did and allowed people to sell their (essentially worthless) bitfloor balance at a massive discount to a speculator who wanted to gamble that bitfloor eventually makes enough profit to repay the lost funds.. in that case it seems like there's a pretty good case for a capital loss.

your tree analogy is flawed as the apples are produced by the tree.. similarly factory machinery could be subject to CGT but the goods it produces wouldn't be.. If you had started with a tree and then later sold that same original tree I think that could in principal be subject to CGT.. your example was further complicated by starting with a seed and growing a tree though.. I have no idea how that would work ;)
In every day life CGT is mainly applied to financial products because if people are making a capital gain profit in non-financial assets they just won't report them. CGT also doesn't apply on 'wasting assets' - that is things that lose value over time.. That's to stop people constantly claiming capital losses on goods that have worn out. There are probably other considerations as well but it isn't true to say that CGT only applies to licensed financial products or commodities. It applies to basically anything that can be considered 'capital'.

hmm ok then.. seems like it might work.. although I'm still not sure if it would count as a capital loss.

I'd never heard of megaupload until they arrested the guy.. there was rapidshare and a few other ones.. never heard of mega though.. also who really pays for that stuff? 
There must be dozens of free file lockers by now..

maybe use something like  to transfer money to an EU exchange such as bitstamp..

Add Visa/Mastercard via Liqpay.com to btc-e.com and bitcoin-24.com.

I think that's very unlikely to be true.. from a capital gains tax perspective the concept of buying something at one price and selling it later at a different price and booking the loss or profit on your CGT doesn't really depend on what that 'something' was. 
What I'm much less sure of is whether this even falls under the CGT category.. theft isn't really what was intended with CGT losses I don't think.. it might fall under as casualty loss instead;

I'd seriously never heard of it which I thought was funny when this whole mess started.
A lot of the numbers around megaupload I have problems with, such as how much money they allegedly were paying cogent for hosting (like $1m/month! absolutely no justification for this..) and how much money they supposedly earned from a service that hardly anyone pays for.
anyway.. bitcoin is bigger than megaupload ever was and unless the media really hypes the crap out of this new venture (it's just a file locker.. i mean geez) I don't think we really need to worry about getting megaupload's or kim dotcom's endorsement.

Do you have any capital gains to offset? It won't do anything for income tax if that's what you're wondering.. with CGT.. I'm not sure.. maybe.
