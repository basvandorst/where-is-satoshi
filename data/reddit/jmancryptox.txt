Woah woah woah. Careful with all that logic and reason, you might explode one of these sarcastic clowns head. 
BTW, it’s nice that someone else is talking about QE to infinity because that drug will be the final nail in the petro dollars coffin. The fed is desperately trying to prop up every market to prevent the inevitable.

That's a good point. What do you have your eye on?

Truth gets -10 votes and the next stupid sarcastic remark gets +11.. bunch of dumbed down, millennial goons on reddit.

Thanks for proving my point

If anything, the memes helped hitlery. I bet there were 100 times as many Trump is an orange/racist/xenophobe/insert whatever misleading attack you can dream up meme vs the memes highlighting just how serious of a criminal cabal the opposition is.  There's an internal battle between good and evil and miraculously the good guys got a player on the throne. Not the best player by any means but the bull in a China shop is what was needed to put the brakes on the full fledged Orwellian system being implemented. 
Down vote me all you want, it just shows you're part of the ridiculous politically correct, feminized, completely duped liberal loonies. Reddit is full of em. 
P.S. Go Bitcoin

If you think memes had a factor in the 16 election I have some ocean front property in Kansas to sell you for a great price!

He would be closer to 200% of her height

Who give a rats ass what that pos says about bitcoin. He needs to be locked up in guantanimo

I spent exactly 1 1/2 seconds on my math based on visual inspection of the pic. She looks a touch over half his height making him close to 200% of her height. If you took the time to look up who they were and their actual height then proceeded to prove me wrong the jokes on you

If you correctly read what I wrote you would have observed that I know there’s more than a few kg’s
@_date: 2019-11-11 14:02:30
Ya, good luck mining even a few kg’s from an asteroid.. good luck affording the Engineering involved with executing that near impossible feat lol
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:58:18
All those articles claiming the value of the asteroid, are bs.. gold is valuable because it is a rare commodity and can’t be created by mankind. If they were to mine tons and tons of it and bring it back, guess what happens to the value of that commodity? It plummets. It’s no longer rare. Articles claiming it will make everyone rich are bogus and countries will go to war over it for industrial/military uses of it. It’s just human nature. Best to just leave it be and not waste trillions attempting to mine it. If they get a hold of that metal the unbacked fiat ponzi scheme continues forever

Those search results are based on how you molded the algorithm
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:13:05
There was a fraction of Bitcoin holders/users in 2013 compared to now. Comparing the ATL from then to now doesn’t make sense

I edited my comment so you understand it better
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:51:18
Uh, let me dumb it down for you champ. When you invest in something you believe will go higher, and you have more of that something, you'll.. wait for it.. MAKE MONEY. Regardless of whether you are mining at a loss or not. Try reading and understanding the entire comment before acting like a 12 year old.

You'll be dead long before the last fraction of bitcoin is ever mined
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:28:08
Mining IMO is about building your position in something you believe in, regardless of these fluctuations. The more units you have when things go up the better

Pretty sure most people hodl because we have jobs mon-fri and can't watch the markets 24/7. Also most people have tried trading and ended up losing a bunch of their position because the market looked like it was going one way then out of the blue does the opposite. There's blatant manipulation going on these days and most people don't have the luxury of following the insane amount of news coming out of the crypto space. 
If you know an easy way to trade please share links or enlighten the rest of us because I'd say you're either lucky or have all day to watch the markets..

You need a lesson on money and currency. You see, there’s these entities called central banks. Central banks are gateways to hell. They are privately owned by very secretive, very elusive assholes and have been creating currency out of thin air and loaning it out to the world.. at interest. For a very long time. They control the media, governments, your life. 
Mike Maloney said it best. Say you have only one dollar in existence, and there’s interest owed on it, (because every dollar is debt) how do you pay the interest on a dollar if it’s the only one? Well, you print another dollar of course. But, when you print that dollar, now IT has interest owing as well. It’s a never ending cycle until the system implodes. The end
@_date: 2018-07-14 00:43:32
When you’re done looking up what a metaphor is you can bring your clueless ass back to the convo. 
Money doesn’t disappear when paying off a debt... lol. You’re basic knowledge of currency needs help. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:16:58
Watch Mike Maloney's series called 'The Hidden Secrets of Money'. Teach you everything you need to know about gold and the financial system in place. Amazing series of 7-8 25 min episodes
