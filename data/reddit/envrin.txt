This has to be an inside job / theft.  There's no way they could possibly be so inept as to leave approx $70 million sitting in the basically what amounts to a "hot wallet".
It's the equivalent of having to explain to a high-end jewellery store that you shouldn't keep $8 million cash sitting in the register.

Sorry, I'm a little in the dark on the details here, but is this what happened with the Bitfinex / BitGo hack?
2-of-3 multisig, both Bitfinex and BitGo hold 1 private key.  Then the two services communicate via an API to sign transactions?
Please don't tell me that's all it was.  Even the most novice of security analysts would have picked up on this vulnerability straight away.  If you're going to do things like this, might as well just throw your funds in a wallet.dat file and hope for the best.

I use a very simple rule of thumb.  If I can remember a password, whether it's the password itself or a mnemonic phrase, then it's not strong enough for me.  I don't have the slightest clue as to what any of my passwords are, and there's no chance I would ever be able to remember any of them.
Many people don't seem to realize that a mnemonic phrase is actually just a 8+ character password (generally 12 - 16 characters), which granted, is quite secure.  The mnemonic phrase is there simply for human memorization, and the back-end sofware doesn't care or even see the phrase really -- the software only cares about the (much smaller) password that phrase translates into.  So if you end up using a smaller / weaker mnemonic phrase that translates into say an 8 character password, then yes, that can quite easily be brute forced.
Personally, I prefer 32 character passwords, and use even more entropy for financial data (ie. bitcoin private keys).  I definitely don't see the need of being able to translate my passwords into a phrase and vice versa.

In that interview you posted, the dude with the Italian accent is Bitfinex's CFO?
"Some people just don't know how to take a loss"?  Is he serious?  That's about the level of dribble you'd expect to come out of Trump's mouth.

He sure took a long time to say virtually nothing.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:48:21
If true, jesus that's sloppy security.  Basic rule of thumb -- if the software has access to funds, then potentially so do hackers, and your security policies should be developed around that.
There's absolutely no legitimate reason to keep $70million in basically what amounts to a "hot wallet" like that, because there's no way that amount is constantly sitting in open trades.

If you don't mind me asking, how does your solution track the txs / incoming payments?
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:06:27
Why not just use BIP32 keys, and keep the private key offline?  That way, you only need the public key online to generate new addresses, monitor new payments, etc.
Example:

Well, if all you need to do is hack BitStamp (or whatever exchange) and get their BitGo API key in order to have BitGo sign transactions, then the whole multi-sig scenario is pretty useless.  There's still only one party that needs to be hacked.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:59:54
Whoops, my apologies, I wrongly assumed when he said "people don't know how to take a loss" he was talking specifically about the Bitfinex hack, not about trading in general.  My apologies.

I don't know about you, but due to that highly informative and reassuring message, I now have full confidence in Bitfinex, and am heading to the bank right now to wire them $50,000.
That was sarcasm btw...
One main thing people care about right now is the security of their system, and it's the one thing they're unwilling to talk about, so communication from them is kind of moot.
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:37:29
Granted, but whether we like it or not, many people are quite obviously more comfortable keeping their funds within one online service / exchange.  I don't understand why either, but I doubt it's going to change any time soon.
@_date: 2016-08-15 01:41:25
Cold storage is free.  No armed guards necessary.
The only difference between a hot wallet and cold storage is the private keys aren't stored online, meaning in order to withdraw funds, the site administrator has to manually process the transaction instead of it happening instantly.  That's literally it.

Why argue to pay a little more?  Because it would still be the cheapest on the planet, plus would render the blocksize debate useless, which currently threatens the very existence of bitcoin.

I guess raising the tx fees may wipe out a dice site or three, but I hardly believe that's the end of the world.  Say $0.30 USD is still quite a bit cheaper than a $25 wire transfer, no?

Not likely.  I've been living 100% bitcoin for over 2 years.  It's just now that I've decided to join the reddit community, that's all.
@_date: 2015-08-26 11:23:16
I don't get it.  Why not develop rules into the protocol that increase blocksize due to volume?  Once say 50% of blocks are reaching 70% of volume for 336 hours (14 days), then increase by 25%, or something.  Wouldn't that work?
Then we don't have to play these guessing games about what the blocksize is going to be in 8 years from now.

I live in Asia...  in the city, but I'm close to tons of villages which Bitcoin purportly aims to help.  I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt, the villagers aren't switching to bitcoin any time soon.  They'll be sticking with cash for the forseeable future.
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:54:55
How?  If I want to send $200 to someone via PayPal, it's going to cost more than $0.26.
If I want to use Interac e-Transfer (e-mail money transfer between Canadian bank accounts) it's flat fee of $1.50, up to $2000.
Personally, I think expecting to send wire transfers globally, instantly, and anonymously for $0.026 is a bit ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:29:11
Exactly.  I just meant with higher fees, we wouldn't need to worry about blocksize limits as much.  Attacking the network with say 500,000 spam transactions would cost upwards of $150,000 USD in fees, so most people wouldn't bother.
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:06:19
But that's why spam filters exist.  E-mail has does an excellent job of it.  It's pretty tough to get spam through something like Gmail these days, and doing so with Bitcoin would be even easier, assuming the miners played along.

@_date: 2017-07-19 00:04:24
Yeah, exactly.  For example, find a user on LBC where the relationship seems to have good synergy, and you've done a decent volume together.  LBC is quite safe due to the escrow features, and if / when you trust each other enough, move it off LBC to private trades.  Some individuals out there trade in quite large amounts on a daily basis, and should be able to handle any trade amount except the very large ones.

Another one of about 2 million reasons I'm glad BitcoinXT went the way of the dinosaurs.  Why would you sabotage something like bitcoin to try to make your own projects better?  If you project is genuinely better, then the market will agree with and follow you.  If they don't, then up your game and develop a better solution.
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:20:49
Yeahm kudis everyone on the team, and thanks for making this a reality.  So nice to see the vast majority of the community rally behind a good idea and implmentation like this.  Quite the relief from all the in-fighting the BitcoinXT fiasco caused.
@_date: 2016-07-28 08:27:09
Pretty simple, really.  Use BIP32, and keep your private key offline.  That's really all there is to it.  Here's an example BIP32 private key:
That can not be brute forced, so as long as you keep it offline and secure, nobody can ever touch your funds.  I think folks like Electrum offer offline signing, or you can use our open source software such as:
I've been getting paid soley in bitcoin for over 3 years, and have yet to have a single dollar stolen from any of my "online" wallets.
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:53:47
Personally, what I think many (most?) of us need to do is draw from the wisdom of the core Bitcoin devs, and all the contributors to the Bitcoin Core code.  These guys know what they're doing, hence why Bitcoin is still on top, and most likely always will be.
@_date: 2016-07-28 19:32:23
Yes, true.  For example, go to  and enter "12345" as the passphrase and the resulting BIP32 private key is:
So yes, if you use a weak password, there's a good chance your funds can be easily stolen.  This is why I don't ever implement even things like mnemonic passwords into my software.  People can criticize me, and preach about how secure things like mnemonic passwords are, but when it comes down to it, those are generally 8 - 16 character passwords, which can potentially be brute forced.
For myself and clients, we get a BIP32 private key(s) generated with a huge amount of random data, and instead of some mnemonic password, I tell them this is your "send password".
Works fine. :)
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:29:47
You can't run a script that randomly guesses that private key.  For example, if you have a typical say 8 character password like "jdAnD9Pk", that can be brute forced.  You just keep running millions of iterations in a script until it figures out the right password.
BIP32 private keys are simply too large to do that with.  Run all the iterations you want, and you're not going to magically guess someone's BIP32 private key, like you can do with say a typical 8 character password.  Only chance your funds are getting stolen is if you're somehow careless with your BIP32 private key and allow it to be compromised.
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:03:18
The master BIP32 key-pair is generated with a seed, yes.  Some wallet services will use passwords (ie. mnemonic) as a seed, and if you get that seed / password used, then yes, you can regenerate the BIP32 private key.
Personally, my software uses 8192 bytes of random data for the BIP32 seed.  I know that's totally overkill, and people can criticize me as they want, but neither myself or my clients ever have any funds stolen, so I have the track record to back it up.

@_date: 2016-07-29 07:32:35
Well, BIP32 and BIP39 are many times used hand-in-hand, but you're right, I personally will never use mnemonic passwords.  You will have no problem finding an unlimited number of people to disagree with me, but to each their own.  Same as some people swear by Javascript based signing, and I simply refuse to implement it.
As for software, it all depends on your needs.  If you just need a personal wallet, then Electrum is probably your best bet.  Personally, I use  to accept client invoices, but obviously I'm a little biased there since I developed it.  Nonetheless, lets me sleep well at night knowing my funds are safe.
