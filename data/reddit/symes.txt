Indeed - bitcoin could really use a run of stability, increased take up and positive press.

If each transaction is logged on the chain then would this mean it starts growing at a rate that is unmanageable? I really can't see how HFT can work with bitcoin...

This is good news!

Possibly - but I doubt those investigating would direct him to make mtgox bankrupt. It might be him trying to leverage his position with investigators. Which is an interesting play. But - have gag orders been used like this in the past?

I was wondering that - he doesn't come across as a guy that has just lost everything...
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:47:55
Yes - for many of us that is true. Sadly not for everyone. If we want mainstream adoption then we'll have to deal with these people, like it or not.

They should look down the back of the sofa, see what else they might find
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:12:39
The second coming of Christ and Jesus decides to hide behind your sofa? Well that was a bit of an anticlimax!

Possibly - maybe &lt; 2%. Or they might see if customers are interested in some equity deal. That's just from reading the conversation, no special insights here.

He didnt denounce it really, afaik he didn't know how to value it.

It depends - regulations could be fairly light and done in such a way that those running exchanges can and will be held accountable. I would imagine positive steps might include no fractional reserves, auditable processes, routine penetration testing, publicly available reports on financial health of the exchange... and so on. Maybe also some protection for customers in the event of catastrophic failure. Personally this sort of stuff would give an exchange far better run than trusting coins to some unknown person in deepest darkest Cambodia. Regulation will probably help move adoption forward in the general public and increase vendors confidence in it.

I agree - bitcoin is still in beta. Usability is pretty low, especially for those who can hardly use an ATM. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:20:57
There are currencies more volatile than BTC? Seriously? 
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:43:02


I disagree - I think mtgox has left a lot of work for the community in rebuilding trust with retailers and the public generally. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:56:51
This is a problem. Too much volatility will scare people away. Bitcoin is, at the moment, a very very high risk investment. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:43:04
any more and I'll die hard

I'm out of bitcoin and investing in popcorn
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:16:17
It looks like this was the effect of one person or persons with access to large quantities of cash and BTCs. Personally, I think this level of volatility is rather unsettling and not good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:41:57
My opinion is that bitcoin could have been huge and brought cryptocurrency into the mainstream. Unfortunately bitcoin has been dragged through the media and associated with fraud, money laundering and now the failure of mtgox. I am worried that this might, at the very least, delay widespread adoption. It still might happen, I just doubt it will be bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:33:57
It looks like one of the main reasons were that they did not appropriately disclose the risks associated with the investment, rather than the means of payment. So it seems regulators closed down a shady energy company. All seems in order.

They are companies with revenue. Bitcoin is a currency. If China is out of the equation then bitcoin is less useful as those in the US will not be able to freely trade with those in China - one of the advantages bitcoin offers.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:47:53
To be fair, most of the posts here are attempting to swing the price one way or other. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:35:38
This probably isn't the time and place for these questions
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:52:02
If he isn't he would probably have a very good idea who is - academics tend to know those in their field and what they are up to.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:53:42
Kind of need reporting standards - this could come from the community easily enough. So that exchanges are ranked by the community according to the information they publish on their health, security and so on. This would provide a clear incentive for exchanges to work to higher standards as verifyably higher standards would probably mean more customers.

I like Kampala - but you should really try and do something about the traffic there. Awesome news though
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:20:34
This is a nice idea. The only slight issue I would have is that a lot of the action would be people sitting at computer monitors typing frantically. The story would need some action - so probably include some Homeland style action of over seas terrorists versus CIA. We'd also need sex. I'm not sure the main mtgox protagonists really fit that storyline either. So perhaps some super-sexy drug smugglers from Brazil might be an interesting link. Or maybe the 3 protestors outside gox towers at the moment could be sexed up - one could be a sexy librarian from Ohio whose rare book collection is at risk unless she can regain access to her knitting circles bitcoin investments. She meets tanned French explorer Hercule who was using his bitcoin investments to help starving children in Bengal. They discover they share an interest in Japanese pottery and end up in bed. All these story lines can converge on mtgox with MK inadvertently pissing everyone off by spilling hot latte on his cold storage... which, as this is movie world and in testament to his ineptitude, he keeps in a fridge under his desk. Cue scene where the main protagonists all independently decide to stake out the local Starbucks to catch MK. MK makes a run for it. A short run as he quickly gets out of breath. Trips, gets his head jammed in a drain, arse in the air. Mtgox investors  take turns in sodomizing him until he agrees to hand over his secret php files. Hercule and the librarian open a refuge for distressed three legged cats. The CIA explode the terrorists. The drug smugglers repent and decide to open a bitcoin exchange. The end.

I realise the current situation is quite emotional, but you might want to not internalise everything
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:46:57
You know that the journalists, editors, cleaners, etc., like to get paid? There's also electricity and so on to pay for. So what is the point in not charging for access? Particularly as most big news outlets charge in some way or form.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:40:00
I think this is going to be the most positive aspect of the mt.gox failure. Exchanges more keen to show they are reputable. This is a good thing and I personally feel more confident in bitcoin moving forward. There's been a pretty important learning curve here. It would be nice to have some community input into what kinds of stats people would like to see.

He has a heavy accent - but if you listen carefully his sentences are all pretty well formed. Also, I have come across students from other countries whose spoken English was no where near as good as their written English. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:08:44
You think that is cool - well... I left a $20 bill on the side walk for a couple of days. When I got back someone had stolen it! I bet the same wouldn't have happened if I'd used bitcoin. Proof that bitcoin is safer than cash.
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:26:13
"the plebes" I am assuming are those who would make BTC a success by adopting it. Unless they do BTC will remain where it is at now.

My understanding is that what you call retail customers are usually* known as "noise traders" - some of the biggest funds that buy and sell on markets are pension funds and other investment houses who, ultimately, service the retail market. 
*edit - what I mean here is that noise traders are probably those you are referring to - there are some very clued up "retail traders"
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:00:51
I re-read your post "any idiot can play the market" is absolutely correct. For some reason I thought, and wrongly, you were calling the professional market makers, etc., the idiots. Apologies.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:13:57
You do not know what you are talking about. The arbitrageurs I have known have been some of the cleverest people I have ever met. And the quants are on another planet in terms of their prowess. These are the guys that "play" the markets. As far as I know there is very little interest in bitcoin in these areas on account of bitcoin being a bit on the small side, relative to other markets. That might change though. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:05:18


Well - an important issue is that crypto-currencies are not contrained. Anyone can decide to set one up, attract investors, cash out and move on. Bitcoin, dodgecoin, all them are vulnerable and it is inevitable more and more cryptocurrencies will appear.

Doesn't matter - a test drive will do nothing. You really need to learn how to drive cars like this. They can be very skittish.
