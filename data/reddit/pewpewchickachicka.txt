Doesn't have to be privately mined. Also doesn't mean the one who did the mining is forced to distribute the coins unfairly.
Why would anyone after 2140 care that people had the possibility to mine? They dont, just as they dont in your dystopian premined coin.
That the founder can abuse the power doesn't force them to abuse it. That means the founder is bad, not the strategy for the coin. I can abuse a hammer and hurt someone, that doesn't mean hammers are bad, i would be.
Satoshi and the old schoolers had the possibility to write a super egocentric bitcoin, that doesnt mean bitcoin is bad, quite the opposite, they didn't take that chance and wrote an awesome software instead. But they had the possibility. Does that mean you concider bitcoin and programming over all bad?

That the founder of the coin choose to stack half the coin does not mean premining is bad. It means the founder is bad. There is no law forcing him to distribute the coins in that manner...

@_date: 2019-11-28 08:56:52
Premine just means that the coins have already been mined. That all premined coins have been all positioned in the founders wallet is just unfair distribution. You can distribute these coins however you like and it would still be concidered premined. With a bit of fantasy you could even release a coin which only has the possibility to get mined untill all coins are mined then automatically "release" which would still be premind coins with the same fairness as bitcoin. You could enter a single coin in to every possible address. Or set up a distributed address which lets every user claim a single coin once they get their wallet. Premine does not mean that the founder is forced to stack a major part of the asset.

Like i said, whatever you concider fair distribution varies from person to person but the whole issue of premined being flawed is not true just because you dont concider the current distribution strategies you can think of unfair. There are plenty ways to distribute coins fairly. You could even set up premined coins to distribute just like btc mining would. There would be no reason but it proves that premining is not naturally unfair. Going by btc as the standard for whats fair and not.
But on this example, why is this less fair then bitcoins mining? You are basically mining wallets, like you said you could generate millions in a second. Just like you mine blocks, the one with best hardware gets most of the price, just like btc. Which you concider fair right?

This is not possible, not because feds print money, but because they are the once owning the money. When you pay with your card your basically asking the banks permission to borrow the money on "your" account. If you want to withdraw physical money its just thf same. If they run out of physical money they can simply deny your request to borrow your own money. No precautions, only negative outcome for them would be if their slaves/customers got angry. Its not illegal to not let you borrow money, its in fact encouraged in some scenarios when the government dislikes the person but can not fight him legally. People writing books they dislike or talk about stuff they want to keep quiet. Wikileaks, those right wingers at hatereon etc.
It would send a message if they started to mass deny users, but if the whole Wikileaks fiasco didn't wake people up i doubt this will. And the banks would severely punish the people doing it. How about instantly scrap a certain bill etc, loose half your  savings pulling this stunt. Not impossible in any way, they did that in india with the support of the prople, all it takes is a couple lies by mainstream media, which is basically the same guys that runs the banks.

What i mean is there is nothing wrong with holdin on to gold.
If you were at a horse race, the same horse has won for 10 years in a row, buying bitcoin would be like betting on that horse, keeping fiat would be like betting on the horse that has lost every race last 10 years, gold would be not betting at all. You might not see the big gains but at least you're not loosing any money.
I'd even say its more honest to just keep what you have earned through gold than make money on the technology disabled persons who hasn't realised the potential of bitcoin with 10 years of being able to read up on it. However there is really no way around that, bitcoin is inevitable to increase in value in the long run as long as people use it.
 I would advise all bitcoin maximalist to hold at least some gold. Nobody knows what the banks will do when they really get pushed into a corner. They might have some cards in their sleeves that could take bitcoin a long time to recover from. You dont wanna end up forced to sell in deep red territory just to be able to buy food.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:09:13
Almost right, so are so close to getting it you can practically touch it. Nothing says they have to start with a ton of coins, that's still the distribution part. You see the terminology is still called "premined" not, "premined and the founders keep the majority of the coins" or whatever you seem to believe its called.
Also your kinda the only one not getting it, think the rest has the brain to google the definition, or are simply good enough at understand english to understand what "mined" with the prefix "pre" means.
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:05:28
Wasted? Its waste energy maybe thats what they heard?
Really bitcoin is built to prevent "bad" consumption, due to the difficulty the miners strive for the cheapest energy. Waste energy is perfect. If you dont have to pay for the energy you get the most profit and can mine the hardest. People who cant keep up has to turn of their miners. Bitcoin also uses 75% green energy. Which kinda makes it the biggest environmentally friendly project, if you wanna go all Greta Thunberg alarmist.

The inflation would work the same way bitcoin does, once the nearly infinite amount of wallets are found the supply is depleted.
The inflation is a good point though. Its the part i prefer in premined coins. If all coins are already mine and you have distributed the coins in a fair way thats that. 0 inflation. Unlike bitcoin which technically is inflating with each block. Kinda envious to the grand grand children who gets to grow up in 2140 with an actually deflating currency.

@_date: 2019-11-29 06:39:29
Still. Even with your definition its not naturally unfair. All depends on the distribution.
Yes its before release, had this discussion somewhere in this maze of ignorant opinions. However to the person getting in to the crypto after everything has been mined its still the same outcome.
And premined does not mean the founder has to do all the mining. It could be public mining just the coin has not been officially released, no documents, not the possibility to use the coins and whatever.
People really need to learn the difference between obtaining coins and distributing coins. This is not always the same thing. Premined coins is not the same as unfairly distributed coins. Premined coins can be fairly distributed. Just as mining coins can be set up to be unfair.

Kinda not as new coins are being minted with each block. We know its top limit when it will no longer inflate. But we are not there at the moment. For the next 120 years bitcoin will get topped of with new coins. As miners sell their coins the value is changed because of the newly added coins. Hence the fluctuations close to halvenings etc
@_date: 2019-11-28 08:25:15
Because to the person in 2140 he will have just as little possibility to mine his own coins. The only difference is how the already mined coins is getting distributed. Which is just a tiny part of the premining and could be done in just as fair way if not even more fair then btcs mining. Depending on what you deem fair. I could for example arguee that giving 1 coin to every person would be more fair then giving everything to the miners and let them distribute them. But thats a whole other story.
If you wanna argue about distributing the coin in a fair way that is one question. If premined is naturally bad is another. They do not intertwine. Just because some scams are premined and distributed unfairly does not mean that the whole concept of premining is unfair. It is very posible to  distribute the coins in a way that would have a "level playing field", but in that scenario we would have to argue the difference of what we deem fair.
The moral of the story is just as the other guys, you judge premined bad because you cant come up with a fair way to distribute the coins. Its the way other coins have been distributed to scam other people you are against. Not the premining itself.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:53:03

Lots of assumption. The choice to premine does not force any bounderies to the distribution. The entire world can help premine the coins or they can be distributed fairly.
Your whole argument kinda boils down to you not being able to figure out a way to distribute the coins in a way you deem fair and therefore think the steps way before that is bad.
You could for example premine all coins and set em up in a trustless way to distribute 50 coins to the one that manage to form a block, with halvening and all. And you get the exact same results as bitcoins mining which you deem fair.
@_date: 2019-11-23 00:40:36

@_date: 2019-11-28 17:09:37
Not at all, premined means that the coins were mined before the currency was released. It has nothing to do with the distribution, who starts with what, or how the coins will get distributed once the coin is released. Just like it sounds, "Pre-mined" pre as in "before" mined as just simply mined. Shouldn't be that hard... its not called "founders-stacking-all-the-coins", not called "One-party-starts-with-huge-amounts", because that is related to the distribution, which is something completely different.

If i understand it correctly they prevent tx spam by sender doing proof of work. If someone is spamming you do a greater difficulty so your tx gets on top. It takes longer than normal but gets exponentially harder to spam.
What i understood about the premined coins is that they started with 300million, distributed them(besides a developer fund) through faucets, mostly targeting poor countries in need. After 133million was distributed people started to automate the faucet extractions so they shut em down and burnt the remaining coins. Dont know how the coins are distributed at the moment.

Immagine someone so brainwashed by the current banking system they think they have to live on money the do not have... Maybe you shouldn't buy that iphone every year if you can't afford it. Maybe a house for 100k is a bit above your paygrade if you do minimum salary. You know you dont have to live the way that the globalist portrait living on the television. That lifestyle is designed to rob you of your last penny. No matter how much you make.
Knowledge and medicine cost money. If you live in socialist eu that money is stolen from you each paycheck, if you live in the us you have to put a side that money each month yourself. But having other people work for you cost money no matter how you pay for it.

I said that we invented facebook as an argument on your bs about millenials being glued to their screens. You wanna talk achievements. How about getting raised by boomers and still turning this ship around instead of just continuing to fuck shit up?
However facebook is quite an achievement as it keeps you boomers occupied so you cant fuck up more shit.
And yea if you wanna talk definitions baby boomers mean being born in a specific time. Thats not really the point when i say someone acts like a boomer. Thought that was pretty obvious.
Nobody besides you are talking about hate, snd why would you bring all that other crap up?
But i think the whole world would agree that to fix something you first have to admit the fault. Why dont you start there.

Just because Satoshi isn't around doesnt mean his completely non-influencial. This whole thing was his idea and most people still make decisions in his spirit.

What makes you a capitalist is not the patent. Its suing everyone using the patent. Look at insulin for example.

What does that prove? You can throw away your whole wallet after use and it doesn't matter if the world is staring at your transaction id. Just because you have a number on something does not change much about anonymity. You have to connect that number to you for the anonymity to be broken.

And once again. That proves nothing about your anonymity. You have to connect the serial/id number to a person before you can even start to break down the anonymity.

@_date: 2019-10-31 12:43:24
Wise elders. Yea lets listen to the people who fucked everything up and let the explain how to solve what they failed to even improve a little bit.
"Your just glued to your social media" could you be more of a boomer please? My generation created facebook. Which currently host more boomers than gen z and millennials combined. You claim the younger are glued to their feeds. You need to raise your head there granpa. As soon as you understood how to work that cellphone you were the once that took over those websites and the younger once left. If you actually did something you could have raised your kids to ignore that stuff. But you fell for it yourself so we had to teach ourselves by your mistakes, once again.
But please stick to that. Gobble down your fast food and keep sitting in that couch. We got this. Just stfu and leg ut clean up after you like weve always done and you might actually get a pension. Or if you really want we can continue with the crap youve pulled the last decade, you wont get any pension, cant afford any health care. And when you get your heart attack we clean the house after. Either way your going the way of the dinosaurs, up to you if you want to fail your way there like your always done or actually enjoy your last years on this planet.

If your parents had it worse than you i feel bad for them. Dunno where they grew up, another planet or something which had more hormones and plastic in the water and co2 in the air? Maybe they were slaves that made less than todays minimum weight? Or the guy that sold them their house scammed them to pay 1000% more than the value of their house which would compensate for the increased price in the housing market? Did they use some no longer existing currency as every single currency on the planet is loosing their value?

Actually bitcoin slow as it is takes less time than average bank transfer. Takes like 3-5 days for that money to change hands, the bank is often just floating that money for you. Try make a return from a store and youll see. And then we're talking abour national transfers. Try sending money globally. Thats a nightmare.
Keyword is bitcoin. Look at alts like nano, feeless and instant. Or lighting for that matter.

Some countries maybe, most western countries the bank can just decline your withdrawal or admit that the bank is currently out of cash. No bankruptcy at all. The currency is no longer bound to the cash. The cash is just a way to physically move value.

Yea they describe how its done pretty well. But they also say nothing about the transactions being less safe as you put more money in to it. Rather what i have said this whole time. It depends on how much you think it worth and what is your pain threshhold for wasting time.
The amount in the tx changes nothing in regards to how easy it is to perform the attack. Its irrelevant. Its just philosophical bs. "if you are receiving more money the person sending it might be more entitled to reverse the tx" but thats completely depending on the gear the person has, if he bought the best hardware in the world to afford an attack like this. $1 will be the last he has left and would need it for ramen. Making it worth more to him than to you.

Old folks dont understand either bitcoin or how the bank is fucking them over. Younger generations do. The replacement is enviable, the question is when. In 10 years? In 25? 50? Nobody who understands inflation and the monetary system wants it. The only people that do want it is the fools who've been brainwashed into thinking inflation is good for the economy. The rest is just puppets that will follow the masses.
Also hodl doesn't mean not use bitcoin. It means to not "throw them away", if you have the option to buy something with bitcoin you take it, then you buy those bitcoins back with the fiat you wanted to use in the first place. Its more spedn adn relpace, than just hodling tight.

Well yea thats how it works. Back then you needed less hashing power to attack it. Because it was still secure enough at the time and you gained more by supporting the network than you did attacking it.
No we just need enough hashing power to cover the cost of the attack to make it non profitable.
@_date: 2019-12-31 09:19:25
Its a cycle, security follows hashrate and people with a lot of coins want to keep their value so will be willing to pay a little more to secure it. Its not about bitcoin serving miners, its about miners keeping bitcoin secure.

Making it more divisible is not inflating. 1.0 is still as much as 1.00000
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:43:37
Doesn't seem so.




Lets take another example if you think bitcoin is to complex. Do you think its impossible for food to be more scarce as long as someone manage to grow a single seed of wheat? Of course not because a single seed of wheat is impossible to supply the demand for food. Right, you understand the basics? Whether the supply is 0, 10 or 50 billion doesn't matter. If it increases or decreased. If the total amount out in the world is 5 or 50 billion. What decides if something is scarce or not depends on supply - demand. If this number is negative you have scarcity. No matter what. No matter if the supply or the total amount grows.
It doesn't matter if 50 billion bitcoin were hodled away, each block came with 50 new billion coins. If the demand is for 51 billion, you get scarcity. How is this so hard for you. Its really not advanced stuff. You just bragged about your grade school skills.
That someone has other coins locked up does not affect the scarcity as long as those coins are not put in the supply. Why would you think something like that? In that case nothing could ever be scarce as there will always be some locked up somewhere. Do you think bitcoin is impossible to be scarce because there will always be 21 million locked in the blockchain somewhere? You do understand what supply means and how it works right?
Don't even get why you keep talking about the total amount. Anybody with half a brain knows that has nothing to do with scarcity. "Food is not scarce in Zimbabwe because the total amount of food on earth is increasing" se how retarded that sounds?

Yes, but the amount is fix. If the price is "priced in", there are 2 btc minted. You pay the priced in price of 1 dollar and so does your neighbour. Then the halvening happen and there is only 1btc minted. Now both you and your neighbour are going to wanna buy btc. But there is only 1 coin. You and your neighbour is gonna go into a bid war and its going to start at $1.

To clarify, if hes not American. That beer is most likely not some light beer and some more "complex" beer, which requires to be poured straight as the carbon dioxide releases aromas, flavors and what not when it breaks. Which means he is the one pouring it correctly. But as Americans, to be stereotypical, only drinks light beer, would not understand this is the correct way. As the American beer is not complex and its more about pouring a beer as quick as possible.

Yea most people seem to think that bitcoin or crypto over all is a fad and they missed the train, nerd money etc. But the more people they hear get in to it the more interesting they get. Think most people are like that, if no people around them understands it and can explain it they will just assume what ever crap they read is true. Which means when and if global adoption goes off it will be exponentially fast, even though it seems to work the opposite now.
@_date: 2019-12-16 02:47:27
Instead of 12.5 btc being minted each 10 min 6.25 will. The supply is lowering hence non-hodled coins gets more scarced with time.

Whats your top alt coins and why?
I've just read up on Nano and MCO which have nice features but the backend is quite crap. Nano is instant and no fees but lack insentives and run quite centralised with their founders and their stashed premines. MCO gives you a sweet credit card, but had to get in bed with VISA and are completely centralised. Wished there were more alts with those pros but none of the cons.

Yea bitcoin is popular for a lot of reasons. That it soon will be deflationary for example. But lying about it saying its deflating at the moment is just disinformation that will do nobody good. By the time its deflationary i kinda hope people has learned to back up their seeds. Kinda make it inflationary again. Even if its just by a tiny fraction its still inflation non the less, we do nobody favours lying, bitcoin is good enough to survive and strive anyways. Even when we get to that point i kinda hope technology has advanced to the point we can mine wallets and put those coins back in circulation. In a perfect world bitcoin wont deflate until were gone. Even though i wish to live and see it.
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:21:06

Why would the amount change how safe it is?

So... For this to work a majority of miners need to extend the chain on a block which only have the header posted. Which they dont. So to get it to work you need to reconfigure 51% of all existing miners. How is this not a 51% attack with a lot of extra steps?
Edit: hol up i just figured it out. Omg bitcoin is the most insecure thing out there. It can be taken over by literally no computing at all.
So preconfig: we change 100% of the miners to accept blocks coming from me no matter what, even if the hash isn't matching the difficulty level.
Hack: I can basically take over the chain with 0.000001% computing power. Even less. I can hash blocks by hand and take over the network with ease. Lol bitcoin is so insecure. Later pheasants.

Dice could have the same problem. Your regular-joe dice roll 6 more often that 1 due to the 6-side being lightest and 1-side heviest. The indentations means loss of weight. Get professional dice. A bit easier to test the randomness though. But tedious.

Yea so first off gambling is bad, second you kinda gave them the money when you decided to fake a person whos assets you deposited and then didn't wanna identify yourself as that person. How would you like it to work, anny hacker could just log in to your account and withdraw your money? Thats like the only good thing with kyc. If you dont like it stay away from kyc. Not really the sites fault. Although you shouldn't gamble anyways so stay away from the site.

How can there be more difficulty targets than there are bits in the hashed blocks? There can only be so many zeroes.
But I assume the difficulty works kinda exponentially? If the difficulty would be 255 zeroes compared to 256. However at that high difficulty, it seems the nuance would be such an insane number it would itself be larger than maximum block size?

You do know 18 million coins are not being minted in each block right? We are talking about the newly mind coins. What the miners sell to keep their machines running. That is the supply. The coins sitting in hodlers wallets that haven't moved for 12 month, are not.
Yes bitcoin will keep getting mined, but only half as much. This is not rocket science kiddo. Do i need to post the definition of the word scarce again? It doesn't matter if the total amount increase, when that increase with half the normal rate and the demand is the same that is the definition of the word scarce.

So priced in means hodlers buy twice as much until the price starts rising to twice as much then then go back to buying half the amount normal amount?
1 coin minted i buy 1 coin for 1 dollar.
Halvening ahead
I wanna buy 2 coins but only 1 minted. Have to pay twice as much for it, 2 dollars.
Halvening happens
.5 coins minted, i no longer got hybris for the halvening and accept 0.5btc for 1 dollar?
Seems a bit far fetched tbh. How could all these random people just perfectly target the twice as much to half as many targets? Why is only the closest halvening affected, we all know next halvening will be in 4 years wouldn't that mean all halvenings are priced in? How come its not "over shot" and price drops after the halvening instead? How does all these people know how many coins the miners have stashed to know when they should start accepting half as many coins for the same price? How do all the sellers agree to rig the price in correspondence to how much they have stacked and how much everyone wanna buy?

No. There is no profit in targeting other systems. Same reason the virus distribution is shifted and stabilise in the same time mac and linux growth.
Think about this. 95% of people use windows, which means if you are going to make a virus, you can pick. Earn 95% and target windows, or &gt;5% targering other systems. Even if windows was the most secure platform it would get the most viruses.
If you hade your savings in gold, youd stack 95% of it in a storage location with an alarm qnd 5% under your bed. Which location do you think would get hit by someone who knows about both?
Btw, there is probably no os that doesn't install bloatware depending on what your going to use it for. "I installed linux herp derp and i got python 2.7, i dont want that"

How so? Wouldn't the 51% attacks on shitcoins build on the same principles prove otherwise? Or just how the bitcoin network is built? Miners decides which side chain to follow or which transactions should be included. If you had more computing power than the network why would you not be able to choose which chain to follow or which transactions to add to the chain?
@_date: 2019-12-31 09:12:57
Yes. But less miners is a threat to the network. The more miners the harder it is to take over the network. It also decentralise btc, as long as the mining is decentralised. So bitcoin kinda has to stay on top to keep people from 51%.

No, demand stays the same, supply is decreased. Those are not the same thing. Demand = anount of people wanting to buy. Supply = the thing they want to buy. Demand kncreases with adoption. Supply decreases with halvening, kinda, depends on how much the sellers has stocked up.
Just because one change it doesn't mean the other does, its just affected by it. If it gets hotter outside it doesn't get cooler inside. Inside temp is still the same, it jusg feels colder as the outside id now warmer.

You think you can reverse engineer the chip and dig out the pin but you think its impossible to copy the content of a chip? You dont see how contradicting that is?
If you dont understand how backing up microship works why dont you watch the video i posted? Its there for a reason. Just shit ass primitive, you can watch all the countless transistors on the chip, write em down one by one to another hw wallets chip, then bam you now have 2x13 tries. But youd problable gonna do it in a simulated chip. Which means you can just copy paste the binary. Now you have a million tries, on a 500 times more powerfull computer. And then pin even if it were 8 digits long, would have been cracked faster than it took me to write this comment. Happy hardware hacking.
You do realize the inside of a hw wallet with its encryption chip is quite the same as the chips used for encrypting iphones? Hardware wise. Its not some black magic run on unicorn blood.

Kinda depends on your definition of the word inflation... The reason the price grows if because more people want bitcoin than coins being minted. But the shear volume still grows faster than its being lost. But you could argue the oposite too, 1 btc has always been 1 btc, its all other currencies thats losing their value. Which means if btc would magically get global adoption over night, and everyone would buy their share. Bitcoin would inflate for a couple more halfenings until people started to loose coins faster then them being minted. The point im making is that more coins are being minted than coins are being lost. It grows in price because of popularity, not deflation.
@_date: 2019-12-19 09:22:13
But that is only true in your fantasy scenario. You could make other fantasy scenarios with the opposite result. What if the 0.0001 btc is just a symbolic sum to register your interest in something equally valuable? Which would get people to want to back that transaction. The amount has nothing to do with the safety part. Like i said multiple times now. Its not changing anything on the security side its only a judgement if you think your time is worth the possible loss. If you want that transaction to be secure you have to wait the same amount of confirmations whether it is 0.0001 btc or 2kk btc. The amount is irrelevant.
Someone who holds 1kk btc is going to care as little about a 1btc transaction as someone who holds 1 btc cares about a 0.00001 transaction.

By the time multiple organizations are aware of it the rest of the world would be to, they wouldn't trust their own hashing and you would see a bunch of organization changing to quantum proof algorithms.
and once again, if the sha256 gets broken, the last thing you should worry about it your wallet. Even if they were to crack wallets instead of banks and nuclear codes, it would be quite suspicious if wallets just started to drop without no apparent reason, then people would suspect sha256 was broken and you would get a fork. But this is really more a fantasy inside a fantasy.
If the military manage to crack it, they wont tell anyone, they would keep it to themselves. Its not really worth risking it to get out by stealing bitcoin wallets when it could result in their whole country getting nuked to the stone age. Or the opposite, its not worth risking it to get out if they need to protect themselves by nuking another country.

The only PoS I've read about so far are premined so only validates. If you get coins for owning coins were kinda back at the banks shitty "rich gets richer and poor gets poorer"-idea. Guess it would be the same when it comes to mining but its not as obvious. Also as the miners are placed in china it isn't really rich gets richer in practise. So coin minting wise it kinda proves pow would be better i guess, haven't seen pos in action. But validation wise i feel it would theoretically end up the same. Kinda wish someone would jump in with some hard facts stating the differences.

If you only have two examples, and both those say the same thing. Which also just the definition of the words used do. And math. Do you really wanna go and assume the opposite?
Also that the price is increased is just because people still have the same demand and are willing to pay for it. The supply would still be twice as scarce as long as the demand dont drop. The price just reflect that but the fact still stand. Price and demand are not the same thing. Keep thag in mind Einstein.
I know your just trying to save your face for making a fool out of yourself. But doubling down on something that can be proven with a Google search will not make you look less of a fool.

People dont seem to get bill gates doesnt work 24/7. He has his working hours and his job that needs to be done. When that work is done he cant really force the world to give him mpre money for more time spent working. Picking up a bill does not prevent him from making his money. Its not like hes staying awake all night because there is still work that needs to be done to make him more money.
So he can pick between getting his normal paycheck -$100, or his paycheck but at the worktime of 2 seconds more, or how ever long it takes him to pick up that dollar bill. There is no option "spend those 2 seconds forcing people or your passive income to generate more money" thats not how it works.

But bitcoin doesnt really aproach it the same way. Now regular Joes put their savings in btc basically chopping of the hydra by the foot instead of heads.

It doesn't really matter if its divisible. I could have used 1 satoshi in the example which isnt dicisible or 100 btc. I just used one to make the math easy. The point im making is that you are paying a price for one amount. The price can be how priced in you like. After the halvening that amount will never be the same, it will be half that and everyone that normally bought coins are probably still wanna buy coins. They will either get half the coins or have to pay twice as much. They probably have a budget for how much they got to buy with. Ignoring inflation. Which means the will get half the smount for their old budget, anyways price doubles. Ignoring hodled coins etc.

Bitcoin is anonymous until you decide to attach your identity to it. After that you have to move around the coins to make it look like you no longer own it. But there is kinda flaws in this "tracing", just like anonymity online overall, for example if you buy 2 btc online kys and everything. Then give either your wallet or transfer the money to a friend who hires a hitman. The fbi cant really swat you all willy nilly and send you off to the chair.

People seem to think the fluctuations are bad. They are kinda only bad when something fluctuates down. With bitcoins increase of thousands percent up. I kinda want more fluctuations... Buying with those coins is like a permanent discount. You enter $100 one day and  when you wanna buy you get stuff worth $200. Thats a win in my book.

Thats why i make profit while you sit at the bench? Day trading is not about making a mil over night. As long as you never sell for a loss you are bound to make profit. Just doesn't go as fast as for the pros. All this "never day trade" is just garbage spewed by "buy high sell low"-people. If you cant profit in the long term of course you are going to loose in the short term to. But keep blaming the game, of course day trading only exist because people like to loose money. You sure understand this better than everyone else.

There is no final block and if there were that would render the blockchain useless. No more blocks no more tx. You should really read up on bitcoins fundamentals... Or why it was created...
@_date: 2019-12-26 10:25:39
That is true. But basically recieving 100 btc on one address once has the same security as first recieving 1 then 99 on the same address. In the end that address will hold 100btc no matter what. However it could be wanted to split that 100btc to 20 5btc addresses. That would in my book be positive. Unless we talk fungibility and you have 50 freshly mined coins. Could be fun to have those intact with as few jumps as possible. But thats merely cosmetics. 50btc = 50btc, i wouldn't care about freshly minted coins unless i mined them personally.

Please listen harder to the bankers. If 2000 years of money laundering hasn't teached you that bankers have no interest in being honest with you and that you are just their cattle then no amount of red pill will do for a long while...
But think about this for a minute. Do bankers have it economically bad? Or are they the riches people on the planet? So when you save your money and do what they do, do you really not expect them to come up with bs to keep you giving them your cash? Don't you think its a little bit suspicious that when you start to do what they do instead of what they say, the whole world will go under in flames?
What would you do if you and everyone you know where economically free and planned to be so for the rest of eternity. Then the people who pay for you start to not pay for you anymore?

Its not about YouTube owing them. Its about having that amount of users, basically monopoly on online videos. Buying up any competition. Only allowing their own views to be displayed. It isn't really a small private owned business that should be allowed to do whatever that pleases them. They are truly influencing the world and that is not something to be taken lightly. Imagine YouTube banning people from sharing one side of a story. All the users would only be fed the other and YouTube would be allowed to pick which side should be the one held by the masses. This is basically what countries pay billions to achieve in war. Now they have a tool to make it globally for 1/1000th the price. It is important to take a stand against this. This is exactly why we need decentralisation. It starts small then it leads to bigger and bigger issues and one by one it sounds harmfull.
@_date: 2019-12-27 22:16:25
Yea but i doubt that margin is thin as a hair. As you see every halvening so far it takes a while before the price jumps. That is basically stashed coins. If everyone was on a thin margin the price would jump instantly.

It doesn't. By the time quantum computers becomes a thing. In like 30 years give or take. Bitcoin will fork and implement quantum prrof encryptions that has already been invented. Worst case old addresses will have to migrate and lost wont be able to so unused coins will get back in circulation.

As of now kinda. In the far future when we will be able to mine sha256 wallets no. Then we will inflate a bit.
@_date: 2019-12-27 22:07:38
How does that even work? Miners throw away half the stash? Counted in as you expect half the current buyers to not want to buy after the halvening?
After the halvening there will never again be the same flow of newly minted coins. How do you "price that in"? Unless the price is dropping by 50% and you count the "priced in"-price as the one before the drop. Or expect hodlers will start selling coins to counter out the halvening of newly printed coins.

You do understand how much easier it is to bruteforce a pin or pass phrase than both seed and passphrase right? Your the one that talked about hiding your shit in well vetted places. How do you expect to keep your pass phrase safe when a simple google search will tell someone where you hid it?

I did, just in the top comment of this tree, you might be to stupid to understand it, but its there. Also a lot of people commented that the code is completely visible, the odds of Satoshi undermined some kill switch to fuck with the users is absurd, he kinda risked a lot to create the entire thing. Hence his anonymity. The whole reason bitcoin was invented was to be better than the current systems not worse. You still haven't read the slightest i see, do you really expect to get far being spoonfed all the information you need? You'll get scammed and quit within a month, be careful.

I don't have to be the majority. As long as I own my own keys it doesn't affect me. It affects me just as much as people having their savings inflated away affects me today.

But sooner or later they will learn to hold their own keys, unless they like having their money stolen from them.

You are completely missing his point by trying to be as autistic as possible. The original supply is half what it used to be. If everyone wants the same amount as they usually wants. The supply is scarce.
"(especially of food, money, or some other resource) insufficient for the demand"
The definition of the word scarce.
No go have asberger somewhere else.
"And if more supply is increasing it it cant be getting more scarce" what kind of retarded assumption is that? Just because there is a supply doesn't mean it can't be scarce, scarce means the supply doesnt meet the demand. If everyone wants the same amount of bitcoin but can only get half that is called scarce.
Grade school was rough eh?

Would be a bit careful with that interest though. First of all you need to stash your bitcoins in crypto.com's wallet. Not your keys etc. And they make the interest by lending the btc right? That could go badly. Don't really have all the insurances that would be needed for me to gamble with 10 btc. But if everything works out that is true, could generate quite a lot of btc.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:53:35
Yes. The supply will be half its original size, hence "the halvening" since the demand is not cut in half the scarcity increaces. How is this rocket science to such a smart grade schooler such as yourself?

@_date: 2019-12-16 11:23:02
No the total amount of bitcoins that exist is 18 million. Most of those coins are hodles away or lost. That means they are not being moved. Like the fifth time im trying to explain this. If you cant get it, its not part of the supply. Zimbabwe is still starving no matter how much food exist in Norway.
Lets say you have an infinite amount of money. Do you think you could buy 18 million bitcoin? No. Probably not even 50%. Now wake up to reality and realise you dont have an infinite amount of money.
I love how you keep changing subject just to be even more wrong. Keep your lessons Einstein.
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:53:16
But there is economic limitations to stakes. Once you start to buy up stakes the price will rise exponentially. Just like buying up hardware would be? Unless we are talking about inflationary coins that would print more, but that is just silly. You could with infinite amount of money buy all the stakes, but you could also buy all the hardware to mine. Thought that was how china got the mining "monopoly" all asics are made in china and they earn more mining than selling the rigs.

Only temporary, the difficulty adjust to the hashrate to keep the 10 min block time. Emagine gold being sentient and digs itself further down to keep the mined golds at equal rate.
A much bigger problem would be if all the miners crashed, an emp over china. Would take much longer to find the next blocks that would set of the difficulty change. Dont know what would happen then. Guess bitcoin would be in a stand still for a while. Pushing all halvenings and deadlines further.

Since its not allowed to have alt-right opinions on sites like YouTube, reddit, Facebook and whatnot these people will of course be the first once on new more liberal platforms.

If this is the new opinions that have to go we would do best learning from the people who has been through the same process for a while.

@_date: 2019-12-03 06:44:28
Which is also a myth. Remember that whole "if bilgates dropped a dolmar it wouldn't be worth pucking up"? If you made 100 billion doing nothing, youd still make 100 billion and 1 cent if you accepted a job that pays 1 cent/24h. You probably wouldn't want to do it as you could do fun stuff all day. But your net income would still be higher.
People dont seem to get bill gates doesnt work 24/7. He has his working hours and his job that needs to be done. When that work is done he cant really force the world to give him mpre money for more time spent working. Picking up a bill does not prevent him from making his money. Its not like hes staying awake all night because there is still work that needs to be done to make him more money.

Iirc there was some docs or a site with some statistics about this. Wounder if anyone has made some advanced analytics, like how many address that holds an amount equal to $10 or $100 valued by the date the btc was transferred to the address. And the opposite, how many addresses that has not yet been emptied that contains pocket change by the time the btc was transferred yet contains quite a lot by todays standard. I'd imagine there is quite a lot of addresses from back in the days containing &lt;10 btc that has been lost due to 10btc not even being a dollar then.
On that though, which is the best api to lookup old pricing? Wouldn't be to hard to do some analysing if there is good records of the pricing back in the days.
@_date: 2019-12-19 19:36:58

All 21 hasn't been made yet. Satoshi just sat the upper limit, other explained how it was done in their comments. 12,5 btc is being made every 10 minuted. When a block get mined. Currently 18 million have been made. Next halfening is next year, then you will make 6,25btc per block. As it is now bitcoin is actually inflating until 2140 when all coins have been made, contrary to what people say. However this inflation is backed by electricity bills, not bankers greed. Its one of the reason btc has spiked each halfening before and might do this halfening too. You no longer get a steady flow of btc as you used to.
