But how would you know that when you open a channel that the other node has channels open &amp; also commited to keeping them open? What if the other node closes their channels? You're then stuck with the gift card? 
This goes even further with other multi hops. What if their node is connected to a channel and that node is connected to channel that you rely on? If any of the two close those channels, your back to square one. You have to put in so much trust that people will keep their channels open.
I might be missing something obvious here though. ��

Woah! This is awesome! I worked on the openpaperwallet code for Andreas. Didn't realize that Timbo made a fork of the openpaperwallet code to include the Satoshi note. Was such a nice surprise to notice the alias names in there :D
So the open source cycle breeds itself. Amazing! Go forth!

I feel the power of Bitcoin is not necessarily the pseudo anonymity (or lack of it), but rather the fact that there is no central government printing it/have control over it, and it's the easiest method of digital payment I've ever experienced. They seem to miss these points in discussing it.
Time and time again, whenever payment comes up, especially for me, whole lives in a third world country with strong foreign currency laws (South Africa), I just want everything to be done in Bitcoin. This year was the first year I could actually receive payment from Paypal into my bank account (after much paper work hassles). It takes a week for me to get the money.
Bitcoin just makes it so much easier.

Hey DeaDTerra,
regarding the shutdown of GLBSE, will take it even longer now to liquidate the coins from the Gamma Bitcoin Fund?

You're right. As far as I know nodes verify blocks/transactions yes, because otherwise anyone can just send you junk data. But they definitely don't add the blocks to the blockchain. The miners do that. A nodes main function is for propagation. In the early  days, back when you could mine on cpu/gpu the line between node/miner didn't really exist. Any node could easily contribute to the network by mining. But now, since mining is out of the reach of many, nodes that don't mine are for propagation. Which is why there's no incentive to run one in the way that miners are rewarded with something tangible (block reward).

Hi! Good question, author here.
I thought the same thing. Here were a few reasons:
* Closes the loop in a psychological way
* Less fees (exchange fees from USD -&gt; ZAR &amp; then buying again with bitcoin exchange service fees).
* Liquidity &amp; spread on local exchanges are not as great as in the US. So buying might be tricky for me and perhaps work out to be more expensive.
* It's simpler at the moment for me (again local exchanges don't have automatic buy orders).
* Finally, as something personal, after I've seen the fiat arrive in my bank account, I sometimes feel that buying bitcoin as a conscious choice to be tricky. Especially since it's volatile &amp; I question myself a lot if I'd rather could've spent that money better in a different way (buyer's remorse). So I love having that cognitive effort removed &amp; let it automatically appear without it ever having touched fiat (from my side). I do end up spending a lot of the bitcoin I receive, but most end going straight to my Trezor never to be touched unless I want to book hotels or do something fancy :)
Does that perhaps make sense?
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:34:39
Oh wow! Author here. So happy to see you got it setup as well. Starting to close the loop is such a cool feeling.

Author here. That's indeed correct. Cape Town is a "C" tier city. We use Numbeo.com to get estimates for locations. The cost of living is definitely a lot less than SF, although my salary is higher than what a developer would earn being paid a local company.

Wow, would love to see how people implement this!
There is so much potential here. Imagine for example, live music events where a Bitcoin user can support the artist while being at the gig by connecting to a channel through his phone. We he leaves, the contract closes (or after 24 hours as is the current implementation) and the artist receives the value.
Value for participation based on proximity is possible!
Another example would be streaming music. A great pay as much as you use model: the user can send micropayments for each second that they listen to tracks of an artist.
Too many great ideas here.

Aliases are mapped by looking at the first three letters after the initial '1' prefix in your bitcoin address. These are merely for sorting purposes and are not used as seeds. Think of it as an easy labeling function.
You can choose to print your wallet without the aliases. I prefer them because it's easier to keep track of what wallet serves which function (I denominate different amounts to different wallets).

The Gamma Bitcoin fund was a good investment. It was closed down due to issues with managing the fund and at the time issues with glbse and gigamining. However, deadterra, the operator of the stuck through the fund trying to get as much btc back to the investors. He persevered and luck was on his side with a big bulk of early asicminer shares.
I ended up making 4.7Btc profit on a 15btc investment in less than a year. It was a great success for everyone involved. So don't judge too quickly.

I've personally done development for safepaperwallet.com which is a custom fork of bitaddress.org. I've gone over the code numerous times. If you understand how Bitcoin keys are generated and look at the code,  you'll realize that they're definitely not pregenerating them. The only really really rare possibility is that the randomness is not truly random. However it's pretty darn solid. It uses the established crypto.js library as well as adding further entropy by mouse movements.
If you have any questions, I'll be glad to try and answer them.

The aliases are not a seed. The alias is determined by looking at the first three letters after the initial '1' prefix of your bitcoin address. The point of the aliases is to easily sort and manage your paper wallets. When I create my paper wallets, I name them to easily keep track of how much each one has. It's easier that way instead of relying on the complex address for sorting. With Safe Paper Wallet and their backup stubs, it's easier to match the stub to note as well.
You have the option to not print the alias if you choose not to use it though.
