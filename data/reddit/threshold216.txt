Agreed.  I looked into them and saw it would cost more in electricity than I’d be likely to make.  This is Chicago area electricity rates. 
Be sure to include the taxes and fees when you estimate the costs.  If I only looked at the base tax rate I’d make money.  But that base rate was matched by taxes to the point I’d lose money with all except the very highest powered model (which would still take several years to recoup the initial investment in the hardware).

I like my Ledger.  I did make the mistake of buying it from eBay before learning that people have lost coins from bad sellers.  
But it doesn’t support every coin out there.  So maybe you should look at it and it’s competitors and see which has the best coverage for the coins you horde.

I had the BSQ colored bitcoin in mind.  Thanks for explaining that it isn’t as straightforward to support colored bitcoins.  (I had guessed it would be like the different tokens for Etherium.)

Are there any cases where a Ledger Nano had been hacked and resold and the new owner lost their coins?  Or is this warning a more hypothetical one — that is COULD be possible so it isn’t worth the risk. 
I know the Ledger app confirms the device is authentic during setup — so the hack would need to get past that, too.

I’ve been reading and it seems that second hand ledgers are unsafe.  I’ll sell the one I bought on eBay and either forgo the hardware wallet or buy one direct from the manufacturer.  :(

I follow the part about trusting a new user that has traded with a good user.  I didn’t follow how disputes would be settled without the third party.
