Well... first the dog hasn't been proven to be stupid, also he doesn't wear glasses. As for grammar, he's a talking dog, lighten up. 'Non-techies' are being educated on cryptos, economics, mining, and many other associated subjects; we're helping raise the young to be immersed in the world of cryptocurrency. I think you'd be a big help toward that effort personally, you'll be asked a lot of 'noob' questions, so patience is a virtue. You know the old saying, if you can't beat 'em...
Come visit the sub and pick out a topic or two that interests you, I think you'd be pleasantly surprised by some of the discussions going on. The sub itself is quite unique, to me it's more how the internet should be; welcoming to everyone and eager to help others learn.

Relative percentage, not dollar to dollar. Bitcoin is worth billions and I know there are philanthropists among the many who invested early. Excellent people in both examples.

I do that as much as my abilities allow, and many others do as well. You're less likely to see them here (as much though, as much of their time is spent on development and promotion. I've found that most dogecoin advocates are also bitcoin supporters, they just found a very special community in and enjoy the entertainment as well as the economic side. Currency should be fun to learn about!
I think you'd make an excellent shibe if you gave them a chance. The welcoming community and positive spirit exhibited there has literally brought some to tears. For me, it's restored dreams of income equality I thought were rapidly dying. It's given hope to those who had little. 
I hope to see you there one day, just be ready to get tipped a lot. ;)

What Doge has that Bitcoin lacks is ubiquitous appeal. You'll see a greater variety of content because the future of cryptos involves *everyone*.
"In Lanier’s new book, Who Owns the Future, which I have referred to many times in recent posts, he argues that free content itself is to blame for this economic morass. The problem, he writes, is that too much of the underlying value of our digital networks (Google, Facebook, etc.) has been left off the books. Here is an example of an artist saying that the bean counters have not counted all of the beans!"
"What Lanier is recommending as a corrective is to monetize everything so that each individual creates material value through the use and contribution to these networks. This is a radical, and some might say unworkable, notion. But although the “how to get there from here” is far from clear (even to Lanier), the future he describes is one worth striving for. Lanier argues that two-way monetization will not only create more income parity, but will lead to a larger overall economy." [Source: Forbes.com](

You could have said this exact thing about bitcoin, especially when it dropped from $31 to $1. The value of Doge lies partly in its ability to attract users of all kinds, but mostly in its growing use to give online content value, the same way bitcoin used to do and will again when cryptos reach relative stability.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:02:33
I appreciate your objective analysis, and yes some of the top ten will change, and more accurately those who perform in the top five or so will become the standard. 
I'd like to see a discussion between Andreas Antonopolus and Jaron Lanier, two people dedicated to bringing financial services to *everyone* and giving user provided digital content monetary value as a way to boost the middle class.

It actually fluctuates, so currently the reverse is true. During the Olympics though,  had well over 2k active users. For myself bitcoin has always held extremely high interest, but seemed out of reach because of the price and scarcity. That's not exactly accurate though as anyone can buy bitcoin, it's just the perception that there is less to go around. That's why the term mBTC shouldl be more popular over time.

Best written statement of the day. +all doge verify

This does have a familiar ring to it, interesting and speaks to the very nature of currency.
Here's a study that you might like, I'm sure some reading this are already aware of it. Those who didn't see it yet might find it enlightening. [Six money experiments](
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:48:47
How you equated my statement shows no sensible judgement. I clearly meant unity *between* cryptos, to support each other and find reasons to align in common cause. I personally dabble in a variety of cryptos and judge each one on its individual merits, the last thing I'll do is speak hatred toward any of them, or act superior as you do. Good day fellow crypto enthusiast. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:40:29
Will do! If you would take a quick look at this post, I think you'll smile as I did.  
If we can do this, the same can be done for bitcoin. By the way we made NBC and Forbes today, the latter said "Dogecoin – Bitcoin’s goofy little brother – has just made history." your goofy little brother did good! ;)
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:49:59
As it stands right now bitcoin is over 100 times the market cap of dogecoin, yet subreddit activity leans in favor of the latter. Bitcoin is the foundation for all cryptos, the top performers should do more to work hand-in-hand to promote use and development. We can all learn from each other and strengthen public interest. What doge is doing is exactly what Jaron Lanier has been advocating; the monetization of internet users. If you contribute something that is perceived to have value, you are rewarded monetarily. Bitcoin has this same potential and even more muscle to make this the new standard. Cryptos are changing the face of finance and developing the new platforms for inexpensive and rapid exchange. The strong will survive.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:15:43
I think it's mostly enthusiasm of the young you see spilling over. Keep in mind we have active miners and crypto advocates still in junior high. They'll be impulsive, that's fairly normal behavior at that age. What they'll grow into though, are pioneers of cryptocurrency who could very well be the most explosive demographic and push cryptos mainstream with a more accelerated pace. 
I have always been reluctant to come and talk in because of some horror stories I've read, but from my experience today I'd say those must be isolated examples.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:09:40
I would recommend watching this [INTERVIEW]( from March 4th, and his new [BOOK]( is discussed [HERE]( on Forbes.com. As the inventor of virtual reality, one of the top 300 inventors in history, and also listed in the top 100 most influential people in the world (Time Magazine 2010) his theories on the future of economy and how the internet plays into that should be read by any serious crypto advocate. Plus he's just an upbeat and positive person. ;)
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:16:26
We base so much of our thoughts on speculation, but it certainly feels like there is a need and desire by many for cryptos to be *the* currency of the internet, one that spills over into the fiat world and compliments it.
Thank you very much for the generous tip. I'll use it wisely. By the way, we just made [Forbes]( "Most Expensive Tweet Ever Sends $11,000 To Kenyan Water Charity Via Dogecoin" "Dogecoin – Bitcoin’s goofy little brother – has just made history." and [NBC]( today, it's pretty crazy.
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:37:53


Isn't that how cynics viewed bitcoin less than a year ago? Lest we forget the $7M bitcoin pizza, the $26 Norwegian bitcoin millionaire... on and on. I recall people in 2011 calling bitcoin worthless and one asking if $6 was overpriced. 
In 5 years, that $0.25 you just sent might be a house, if bitcoin does as projected. Dogecoin has the potential to equal market cap in time, it's not a meme, it's a currency that utilizes popular culture media, the same way fiat does. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:49:12
You fail to see a many things, and clearly have a closed mind. Your loss.
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:17:56
I see no value in bickering between cryptos, but you're entitled to your opinion. What's needed is more unity and adoption of successful development and innovation. "A house divided cannot stand."
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:07:53
I couldn't have stated it better, we've seen the biggest theft in history and while highly immoral, it was technically legal. Cryptos promise to restore what has been lost, if not create an entirely new economy by which to escape the indentured servitude that we've seen increase over the past few generations.
I have to thank you for your insight, and I hope you consider making a post in stating you're from and would like to say hello to everyone. It's a lot like having a littler of puppies smother you with affection. :)
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:09:23
What do you want? We missed out on bitcoin and believe in something that makes positive change that you can see happening every day. Many in the community are lower income and hoping this can help restore the income they have lost in recent years. 20 million kids on food stamps, and that's only talking about the US. Doge is less than 1% of bitcoin's market cap *as of now* yet we give a vastly larger percentage to charity. We care, that's what makes doge special, and why it's becoming so big in such a short time. 
We haven't seen the 10,000% increase in value as bitcoin has, not yet at least. If we could tip mp3s, we would; and much more.
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:13:29
Haha now I want some Chinese for dinner, good idea! What's your time estimate for the first bitcoin billionaires? Also do you think the world's first trillionaire is possible as Antonopolus said? Bitcoin has scratched and clawed for every bit of market cap, and after last year's massive growth; this year should be very interesting. I believe that the explosion of altcoins has halted bitcoin's market cap, that along with China and Russia taking a (temporary) negative stance.
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:31:30
This is good for cryptos as a whole. Thank you for supporting this community. I suspect there will many mentions of how Bitcoin is the origin of all digital currency in the many media articles we'll see after this first race on May 4th. 
I have to say the bitcoin infrastructure is reaching an impressive level of development. What I've seen is polished and professional. Multibit is insanely fast, it syncs in mere seconds. I encourage anyone who entered into digital currency because of Dogecoin to explore Bitcoin. Knowledge is power!
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:49:32
You can go tell this to the special needs children we provide service dogs for, or the Kenyans who will now have sanitary water because we (who have less than 1% the current market cap of bitcoin) give until it hurts, knowing this slows our currency's growth. I believe in bitcoin just as much, and if you had the same openness toward the subject to invite more friendly discussion; you'd realize you can educate rather than insult. You'll get better results.

NHRA would also be a great place for a crypto sponsor. Lots of camera time in the staging area. The 7 second Bitcoin prostock. ;) 
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:36:27
That's a good way of putting it, dogecoin is the foot in the door for the average person who isn't tech savvy. Make it fun and less complicated. 
The more recent trend is to use Doge for commerce as bitcoin has been and will more in the near future. I'd take any crypto seriously that performs in the top ten, they all have value by consensus. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:21:49
That made me laugh, the visual was really something! You'll find that you don't have to love animals, I think a lot of your misconceptions would disappear if you gave them a chance. If I see you there it will make my evening, but if not, I had a very pleasant conversation with a person I have come to respect and hope to talk to again. Thanks for making me feel closer to the bitcoin community, we do share common ideals at the core. ;)
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:43:08
Cryptos are the future without a doubt. The crisis in the Ukraine might cause Putin to change his stance toward bitcoin, as he now wants to move away from the USD in light of sanctioning. The silver lining might very well be made from cryptos.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:42:23
You obviously have a bias and fail to see the big picture. What you call pollution is actually a sharing of ideas. You want one sub banned from another for what? You call Doge 'crapcoin' out of hatred and disrespect, and talk down about the fact that we have all ages learning about cryptos and mining, as well as economics. Maybe if you weren't such a stuffed shirt, you'd help the next generation as well.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:28:53
My belief is that bitcoin and doge (as well as others) are the future, for different reasons, yet aspiring to the same ends; worldwide currency that's not debt-based. The cream of cryptos rise to the top, and I envision the future as being a handful of cryptos that vary in exchange volume based on performance.
