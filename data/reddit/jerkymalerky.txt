I edited the post guys. I tried rebuilding my wallet from the seed, but the unconfirmed transactions still show up. 
This is one of the transactions on the block explorer

Ok, I guess I'll just forget about it for a little while, from now on I'll set much higher transaction fees.

Thank you very much for explaining that. I haven't seen it broken down like this. I usually have only thought in terms of BTC and these other units had me slightly confused. So If I set my transaction fee to 0.001 BTC/kB, I should typically have no problem getting confirmations?

I have not seen that site before. Thank you. I have been trying to figure this out all day and I usually find people asking the question when they have their fees set super low. But I have changed no settings in my wallet and have never had this problem before.

Yes I have. look at this example 
I paid 0.0001356 BTC for only 226 bytes.
Should that not get my transaction confirmed in 24 hours?
