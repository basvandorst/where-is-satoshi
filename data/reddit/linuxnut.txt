The dream of becoming a shrimp boat captain is slowly fading away. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:57:58
Tuesday Wahoo! 
Thank you very much for this giveaway. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:38:00
Go to Changetip.com &gt; My Money &gt; Scroll Down to **Withdraw** Click **Send** Type in your address and the amount then click send.
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:51:32
was the first one to send me a tip a month ago... It has really taken off in that time. 
Its a lot of fun, thanks a lot, I can't wait to see where it goes next. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:46:06
How? He is not a mod in @_date: 2014-11-09 20:25:06
No Me---- 3 Hr old
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:32:34
Thanks for the info, I have been looking for DIY type to tip to, but I want to tip those who post their own how-to info, not just a link. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 06:40:59
I could, but right now I want to tip good content. He has lots of money to give out. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:50:28
I know why, he has his own thread....  
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:35:39
Trolling! 
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:27:34
Happy Tuesday! 50 bits From me @_date: 2014-11-10 21:19:30
Its called "The Power Of Positive Thinking". 
Now give some coin, thats called "Good Karma". 
50 bits @_date: 2014-12-27 19:09:30
With all the time spent trolling, they could have had a super good job making lots of money. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 06:43:02
Well they are working on it... 
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:51:51


Yes a real job. But I am looking for Freelance type of work.  
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:11:15
Shouldn't Bitcoin speak for itself? Why fight, its childish.
@_date: 2014-11-09 05:18:14
You can use it with FaceBook!
@_date: 2014-11-16 05:05:36
There have been some discussion over at about making the min tip 100 bits, to avoid the 2 bit spamers.   
Random $1 tips are great. I wish I could give them out too.
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:18:43
you might not, but people do give bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 14:12:02
I can't afford $1 every time  I wish to tip someone. Also 100bits is not too bad, If 28 people at 100bits *about 3.5 cents at this time* is $1. or 14 at 200, or 7 at 400bits. Keep braking it down. Its not bad when your getting coin just making comments. 
Also try out stock photography, you get approximately 25 cents per image, talk about an insult. 
I would love to get $1 tips all the time, but thats a lot to ask for when your giving your 2 cents. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:18:39
Your other one, because I noticed it early this morning saying Removed. I thought you did it. Then your second one showed up with the text. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:16:47
Thats really cool. The bitcoin community is great.
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:16:28
That might work, but I would feel much better if it was connected to a light wallet with a small amount of coin (The amout you intend to spend). 
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:31:32
This is a great idea, but remember anything linked to your wallet will have more of a risk of getting hacked into, it will give people more open ports where they can gain access. I would not do this to your main wallet. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:56:42
Cool, thats good promotion. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:15:24
Happy Tuesday! Thanks to Bitcoin it will be a lot easier to donate now. Thanks for the writeup!
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:50:44
Did I say that?
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:46:43
This one still going? 
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:48:53
I am against the big business, they make billions and they pay out just about as much, what do they pay for a super bull ad? I think they are doing fine with out me advertising for them. I don't care how much they are paying me, its not worth the crap they are putting out. 
Shirts for small business,= Great! 
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:41:45
[Newegg.com]( accepts Bitcoin. Maybe a flash drive!
200 bits @_date: 2014-12-22 04:17:36
200 bits @_date: 2014-12-04 23:53:06
But we can fight them just by having a superior product. Sure do a side by side of what Bitcoin has vs Master Card / Weastern Union. All the name calling does not set a good image for Bitcoin, and does not sound very professional. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 15:44:30
Happy Tuesday! Good to see people spreading the love. I bet Charities are going to start likeing it.
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:09:39


lol naa, I don't think so. Did you encript your Home folder?   
@_date: 2014-11-15 19:57:44
I would not download a program that connected to my wallet, or my ChangeTip account. 
Sounds like a good way to steal some coin.
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:18:12


I started a topic about this! [When Not To Tip]( 
When its just someone posting a link to some news story, why tip? If it helps someone out, Knowledge, Instruction, How-To, or makes you laugh, send a tip.     
 &gt;&gt;If you want to be more discreet, all you have to do is add the word 'private' to your tip:
I think in a lot of subs it might be better to send private tips.
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:12:32
I don't care what he thinks. He and his NSA software can go away! 
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:58:51
Ok in that case, why not install one to a USB drive something like Slax, or larger if you have enough USB space.
@_date: 2014-11-10 07:01:34
I am sure there are websites that would do that, but I really don't think anyone will unless your well known to them.  
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:37:32
This one looks fine 
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:02:18
"What is Bitcoin you ask? Go here and learn more  or tap me on the shoulder" 
So this would confuse you? 
@_date: 2014-12-09 06:04:49
Its not just on Bitcoin, if you express any difference on main stream thought you get trolled, it does not matter what sub your in, or topic. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:34:06
I got one too, and I did click, its just a crappy looking message board.  
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:04:22
Its a really cool idea but, since you are a new member with no Karma, your not going to get a lot of help. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:48:46
Oh I see!
@_date: 2014-10-12 01:21:05
Well unless your promoting your own personal product, I don't see any reason to be a walking billboard, as shown in the photo Coke, Star Bucks, Redbull ect.. Why should I help make them (any big-business) money for a product that in the long run does me no good.  
As for no one is going to give me bitcoin for waring a QR code, why not? People on riddit give Bitcoin and tips every day. Its for fun, people would like it.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:48:12
Supply and Demand, just for the fact that people want it makes it valuable. You can do that with anything, just limit its supply.  
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:53:02
Good suggestion! You can always do that now with your tip.me account see LinuxNut.tip.me
Since Google+ is in the works *Beta* I think google mail will be on the way. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:39:33
I have not been on bitcointalk in a long time. I mostly read what is here. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:24:33
I am sure you found it, but they only way I could find the IP address was with Nmap...
**EDIT** LINK 
This is the ip address I found **104.28.11.96**

Well I might ware your business shirt, "Most likely for free". I think it was a bad idea to use those products in their example.    
Why advertise for big billion dollar business, who don't need your help, while the little guy struggles. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:36:35
What does he give you when your bad? ButtCoin?
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:41:18


I know, it makes me sad! 
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:22:52
Hey Steve Happy Tuesday. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 00:18:03
You can add a comment saying you sent a tip, but keep it private to avoid the bot. 
  
@_date: 2014-10-29 04:13:16
I see! I guess I will go with the idea of using a Live USB. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:44:20
Go to **ChangeTip.com** &gt; **Settings**, Under **Locale** &gt; **Preferred currency** set it to USD..
Go to **My Account** look at  **Sent &amp; Received Tips** it should now tell you what you have been tipped bits and USD.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:31:10
Really? So is that all I need to do use the Quotes "RemindMe! 1 day"
Is that in most subs? 
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:35:36
Very cool! Thank you! 200 bits @_date: 2014-10-11 02:58:18
You could always look at [Craigslist]( and see if anyone is traiding. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:42:43
I wonder if its that is removing it?
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:36:20
PayPal has been known to freeze your account there are many horror stories, also and I do not like the banks hidden fees, or the chance my card data could being stolen.   
@_date: 2014-10-12 01:27:32


I don't see how your going to get paid for waring a coke shirt!
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:43:12
Why not just make your own shirt with your QR-code and address. Along with any Bitcoin promos you want. 
There should be t-shirt shops in the yellow pages. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:21:08
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:48:10
Look here could this be it at all? 
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:48:13
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:41:49
And thats why you should make a shirt, along with a web address for more info.  
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:09:06
I do not see how any one coin like "Reddit Coin" could do any damage to Bitcoin, since it ~~is~~ would be "Reddit Coin" people who do not use Reddit will not know, and most would not adapt to a coin that is named after a well known social media board. However I do see in the future that a lot of sites will try and adapt their own rewards system. But Bitcoin is more global and more well known, with all the big money people have put into it, with their cash and computer equipment. I don't see it going anywhere anytime soon.  
Sure other countries would want to make their own coin, but there still would be room for people to traid their coin for Bitcoin, or anyother alt-coin. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:10:30
I keep my eye out there, but I am looking for a business that is offering jobs and Freelance tasks. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 01:41:48
Very Cool! 200 bits @_date: 2014-12-14 15:21:18
I am pleased that a big name like Microsoft, however I will not use Microsoft products, I do not like their business practices.    
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:34:07
Oh I see. I thought you could just sign up for Changtip.com then link your accounts.  
I just signed up with Reddit.
In that case they need to give people an Changetip.com Login.
 
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:46:32
This site?  
If so they have a twitter account 
Leave a comment.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:33:52
This one says Removed
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:34:24
This one also 
I would make a report and ask whats going on...
@_date: 2014-11-13 21:55:23
The biggest tip I got was $1, I have only giving out around 100-500 bits at a time. I would like to tip those with quality posts, not just the giveaway sites.   
@_date: 2015-01-01 16:03:52
Can't you have one for each, that is disposable that once spent its not usable? 
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:06:55
Thank you for all of your replies, my main problem is, I don't have a Cell phone, and I don't want one. So I wonder if that is going to leave me out of the loop when it comes to buying in the Brink and Mortar stores. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:09:47
Maybe you can clear it up for me. With out me posting in , what is with this [*Rule 41*](


~~Are they targeting TOR users? Answer yes ^... But are they really?~~   Did this pass, are they doing it?  
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:50:29
More so, some of those pirated copies have backdoor/mail ware/spy ware put in by the person who pirated it in the first place.  
Why not just use Linux, and never use Windows for anything personal. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:01:40
Since it is open source, with more people with the ability to see the code and find possible back doors and open ports. I think Linux has a better chance not to have a back door. 
But that says nothing really, once you log onto the internet, your tracked, unless you go to extraordinary means to hide your whereabouts.   
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:48:11
Sounds fun, but I don't have anything Android. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:27:20
Exactly!! I have worked on a lot of computers, clearing out all of crapWare. I would have a problem getting people to invest their money, knowing how people use their computers and most computers are family computers..
Unfortunately not everyone is meant to run a Bank.
 
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:01:21
Eww WTF Perv!! Are you offering the OP something? 
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:43:50
Satellite internet is at 5GB per month. This is in the US..
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:16:39
Why don't you export your privet key and import it to your other wallet?
Also when backing up your wallet (Using electrum anyway) it will not save imported privet keys. Be sure you back this up as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:37:49
You might be able to recover it with a  Linux Operating system (They run as a live CD "Runs in RAM" if you don't know) look at Ubuntu. 
After you get the Linux Live CD up and running. See if you can access the hard drive, if you can make a backup of your wallett folder or what ever folder that has the info. ( I am not sure )
@_date: 2013-05-24 15:31:03
The Mall would be a great place, it would attract a lot of attention.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:42:04
That would be great, I am sure to do that in some of the mom and pop pawn shops and second hand stores. I think they would be the first to adopt it. 
Another idea to add to that is, I was thinking about making some Bitcoin Business cards with some websites that explain it. Also adding a receiving address to a few. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:46:32
Thanks everyone! This should get me off to a good start.
@_date: 2013-05-14 16:13:52
HAHA!!! Now I am just lazy!
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:10:40
They are fine, They do payout, but not very much. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:30:27
I tried changing my fee to 1 and it resets back to 0.0005
I wonder if they are going to force us to pay a fee. ( I have no problem with that)
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:56:36
So its safe to do right? Or are there any extra safety mesures I should take?
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:04:20
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:43:17
Yah I just figured that out. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:44:28
I was about to post this link. Here is the direct link
Its just a forum where you can post your address and ask. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:15:04
Sure why not? You could work it with a QR code and a pin number everything else is Internet.

No! I don't drink....
It was a global message at the top of  Reddit. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:32:23
I am not sure about your title but if you get your money back its free!
Try buying some stuff at Yard Sales then sell the items on Bitmit.net
Look for small items that can be shipped easily, or even give the buyer free shipping. 
Your too for a job, sooo, your a kid right? Got any cool toys? Sell Sell Sell...

The Free coin sites are usually less then a penny, some of the survay sites and web visiter type you can make a few cents, but the time spent you could be out looking for real work, its more for fun I think. I was looking for something with good pay but I have not found anything yet.
If you have stuff to sell check out

What does age have anything to do with how well someone can write?(,) Or even Bitcoin for that matter? 
I was good at writting at 14 too.
