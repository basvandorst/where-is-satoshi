how we choose to pay for the costs of regular medical care (premium, deductible, or taxes) is a separate issue.  the point here was getting stuck with like $200k and going bankrupt, and that's a small percentage of the population at risk, not "most"
a high deductible isn't going to be pleasant, but it's also not "*sell your house and drain the retirement account and go bankrupt*" kinds of money.
as for excluded stuff, I'd think a private plan would be accepting of more not necessary treatments than government provided stuff.

most is an exaggeration. employer provided/Medicare/Medicaid/Military cover most people.  
it's about 15% that buy their own healthcare and 5% that don't have healthcare.   keep in mind that 15% includes all the self employed people like small business owners.

yeah, so that 200k thing isn't an issue for like 95% of people, since they have insurance that covers it and would just be on the hook for the deductible.  it's just the 5% that can't afford or choose not to buy insurance who would be at risk.   in that case though, bankruptcy and having bad credit for 7 years (*if you can't afford insurance you probably have bad credit already anyway*) is a small price to pay for hundreds of thousands of dollars of top tier health care you don't have to pay for.

same with taxes to cover government provided healthcare.  it's not "free" and someone has to pay it.  hospitals, doctors, etc. aren't volunteering.   how that cost gets distributed is another issue.
so yeah, that's not the argument here.  just that the risk of a $200k (or whatever) bill that bankrupts you is only a risk for a smaller percentage of the population, not "most"

first of all, not having savings doesn't mean they aren't making money. just that they spend as much or more than they make.   70th percentile is like $60k/yr
savings or not, you don't go bankrupt for a $5000 deductible. 
 making payments and driving a car that's not as nice is a much better financial decision than going bankrupt and wrecking your credit for a decade. that's if you'd even be let go bankrupt.  you likely have assets that could be sold to cover most of that, and going bankrupt they'd be taking them anyway.
