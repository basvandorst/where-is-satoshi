Yeah that's true. I'll see if I can learn from Andreas and play with the wallets some.

Those are fair points. I wish I could take a class on this to be honest but thanks for the help. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:21:38
I see.

I'm just not that savvy when it comes to this. Can you tell me some respectable web bases alternatives to block chain?
And also correct me if I'm wrong. I don't have to access the private paper wallet until I'm ready to sell out?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:25:04
I'll try it out thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:21:28
Thank you.

Can you explain number 3 like I'm five though ? Please. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:03:48
Do they have a phone number or email or something

Have there been any cases of exchanges getting hacked yet ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:43:15
At what point in this process do you access your wallet? Can I just wait to access it for the first time when I want to send funds back to the exchange ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:57:22
Theres bit address though ... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:56:54
But if they're in a private wallet, they can't make money in an exchange, right ?
Why have the coins in a private wallet rather than a traditional bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:58:38
I thought you had to use your private key to access your wallet but now I guess you don't. 
See I created my keys using bit address not block chain.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:00:39
I got a mac tablet and Android. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:54:55
But if the exchange gets hacked, you don't have recourse to get your money back, right?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:05:59
Okay. So what I should do is this?
Load money up to the exchange. 
Transfer my coins to a private wallet. 
When I'm ready to get my money out, I transfer back to coinbase and then to my bank?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:07:57
So is there any kind of advantage to leaving coins on the exchange ?
Basically what you should do is only use the exchange for buying and selling and keep coins in a wallet?
