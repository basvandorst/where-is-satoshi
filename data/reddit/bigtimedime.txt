Certainly anyone can check the blockchain to find out how many coins are at a specific address. Thats just how the bitcoin system works, which is (to me) not a problem in itself.  
Where I have a concern is that a hacker (or nosy third party) can discover what address on the blockchain is most likely yours.  If the IP traffic flowing from your phone is open protocol from the phone app (like mycelium or blockchain) then a third party can relate your IP to that address.
Are the phone apps not regularly polling the wallet addresses?  I recall that the blockchain app immediately notified me when the BTC arrived.   
I've read that electrum uses its own servers (which I assume are https or ssh encrypted)

Do you not need to carry any fiat cash in your pocket ever for day to day needs?  Doesn't the volatility day to day of your BTC savings bother you a bit? It has the potential to lose its purchasing power dramatically in the next few months.   Every thought about diversifying your savings and investments into other asset classes for lowering risk.

So the "new normal" will be that to earn an interest rate which is above inflation, a person will need to risk their life savings with the possibility they can get legally seized at any time the bank goes bust?   The fed has bought up treasuries during QE which has forced the yield to near zero on low risk govt bonds.  The intended effect of this had been to force investors into riskier assets in their search for yield. This 'bail in' concept is just one more example of this government agenda.  Federal governments around the world are desperately trying to artificially stimulate economic growth.  
 This path isn't sustainable for the long term.   Look at Japan. They can never repay their govt debt.  Just like in 2008 with bad mortgages it will need to be deceptively repackaged and resold to someone seeking to invest for higher yield. And someone will be ignorantly left holding this toxic waste when it melts down.
 Just watch the disaster during the next credit crisis. It will make the 2008 sell off look like 'the good old days'.

The cost of hardware, electricity and time in generating a block reward is certainly part of what gives each BTC unit some of its value.  If it wasn't so costly and difficult to produce, then each BTC would be worth far less.  Many miners have indeed wasted much time and electricity trying to find a block reward.  But for those who found one, they might disagree that it was a waste.  Some early miners have gotten quite rich haven't they?
 It also has value for its utility and relative anonymity among many other attractive qualities.

In order to know if bitcoin is expensive or cheap,  investors need study the fundamental data that can be used to value bitcoin.  What makes 1 BTC worth $600?  Primarily it's what people are willing to pay for bitcoin that determines what's it's worth right now.  But what are some valuation metrics we can use to determine market value?  Supply and demand are two important factors to consider.
There are now 13 million bitcoins in existence.  The supply increased about 20% last year, but the rate of mining will slow exponentially until the last coin is produced at a total of 21 million.   By 2017 the supply increase will only be 4%. The last block is projected to be produced by 2024.   'Scarcity' is another aspect of limited supply where it's not very easy at the moment for someone to get their hands on a bitcoin.  There's 6 billion people on the planet and very very people have one to sell you.  There's not many shops or other business locations you can go.  There's only a handful of online locations to obtain bitcoins and most sellers will either charge a premium over the current 'spot' market price. 
 It has a value both an asset and for it's utility.  Bitcoin is useful for all kinds of reasons.    But demand for bitcoin is from investment (both long term holders and short term speculators) and from it's use as 'e-money' for online payments. 
An interesting comparison might be between Western Union,  Paypal or Moneygram.  The revenue of these companies .  Western Union has an annual revenue of 5.6 billion.  Moneygram has an annual revenue of 1.5 billion.   The market cap of Western Union is 9 billion.  At the moment, the current market cap of bitcoin is 7.755 billion.   It's quite possible that bitcoin is such a disruptive new technology it will significantly impact the revenue and subsequent valuation of these companies. 
Another interesting valuation metric is calculating the cost of production.  If you do the profitability calculations with the cost of mining hardware and electricity most results are showing that with the increase in difficulty it's tough to break even.

Any way to find out more about what this 'input' consists of? I think understanding this 'genesis' or 'spawning' of each BTC unit is key to knowing what the bitcoin unit of value itself is.  It has to consistent of more than just a mere public 'ledger'.  I'm asked by friends frequently who want to know exactly what a "bitcoin" is.  Just telling them its a record of exchange is not enough (is sounds like a ponzi scheme where we're passing around a bunch of fluffy nothing to each other).

Maybe generate some paper wallets using an offline machine?  Your watch only addresses can't be hacked if the private key has never been 'hot' or stored online as far as I understand.

It would seem prudent to diversify your asset classes into a variety of things.  Don't put all your eggs into one basket as they say.  And never invest in risky assets what you can't afford to lose.   A bit of gold, and cash locked away in case you need it, isn't a bad idea.  But you can't eat gold, so maybe a decently stocked pantry with provisions could help you cope better on a bad day. Some people suggest bullets will be like gold when the SHTF... but not all of us like guns so much.

Is bitcoin volitile? Yes... worthless no.  Overvalued?  How do you know that? 
What makes you say bitcoin overvalued?  What fundamentals are you basing it on? 
Here's some fundamentals: 
There are about 13 million coins worldwide right now, and there will never be more than 21 million.  
I keep hearing miners say that if you buy new hardware to mine you're not going to break even.  It increasingly takes more and more energy to create new coins. AFAIK  if the price falls (like it did today) miners make less money.
Bitcoin has utilitarian value, you can use it to send money anywhere in the world digitally.   The number of people who demand this technology is steadily increasing.  Just consider China and the number of millionaries there who want to move money overseas.  Think of a DIY almost anonymous version of Western Union or paypal.  These companies are worth billions of dollars are they not?

"It's a revolution as well as money"  A revolution yes, maybe something like a commodity rather than a currency for now.  
This revolution in cryptocoins  is similar to the digitization of photography, music, video, text, documents, magazines etc etc.  These entire industries have been forced to change dramatically in the past 10 years.  If you worked in those industries and didn't keep up with the change you're screwed.

Supply vs demand. When its falling there's more sellers than buyers. And sellers are competing for a sale and increasingly willing to lower their asking price to get it sold. Buyers are increasingly lowering their bid price,
 being less willing to overpay as its likely to drop further.  
The average price for the past 200 days on Bitstamp is only $528 US so it could still easily come down another 10% from here.

Thanks for explaining this.  I've been wondering for a while now what it is that makes  the web hivewallet an HD wallet, because I've only seen one address shown when I made a new wallet.  Unless I've missed something, the HD feature and how it works hasn't been explained on the website or in any review that I've found.   I had a feeling that it works by generating a new address for every transaction as you've said, but I wanted to confirm this.  
Another question I've been asking about lately when it comes to bitcoin wallet apps is how they send and recieve IP traffic.  The web hivewallet is https so that means it's the traffic is encrypted when it is sendig or reciving bitcoins or looks up the balance of an address? I assume it's using dedicated servers for hive wallet?   I think an important part of wallet security is privacy, and ensuring a third party can't determine what address is associated with the IP address of the user.  Can you clarify how web hivewallet and the other verions of hivewallet send and recieve network traffic?

I just discovered that BIP38 private keys made using an older version (from a few months ago) of bitaddress.org  and bitcoinpaperwallet.com were not compatible. So I destroyed those (they were empty)and remade them using the latest version.  Using the latest versions seems to be compatible, and it also worked with Mycelium.   Its a good idea to test out your  BIP38 encrypted paper wallets to ensure it works properly before you send any serious amounts of bitcoin to it.

First off I have to say how much I love your work.  You've provided an easy to use solution for secure offline generation of private keys and addresses and even utilize BIP38 and QR scanning in an html app.  This is a huge service to the bitcoin community! 
Using firefox V20 on a live Ubuntu 13.4 USB key and a March 1 2014 version of bitcoinpaperwallet.com  I retested the private encrypted keys again that were generated on the v2.8.1 version of bitaddress.org
I was able to replicate the error a few times.  However it scanned and decrypted correctly more often than not.  It appears the error is in the scanning of the QR code.  I don't know if it is just that one Qr code that was problematic?  Sometimes it scanned in with a ")" or "I", instead of an "i" character as it should be.  I tried changing the orientation of the QR code to see if that was it, but most times it worked regardless of the orientation.    So it looks like thats where the problem was in the QR ?  
I assumed that QR codes had error correction built in and they wouldn't scan unless it was 100% accurate?

There's some serious selling going on last week and today. It might be related to news on sanctions against Russia?   Some traders are talking about finding support around $555.   This crazy wild ride will continue.  Bitcoin has been highly volitile since day 1 has it not?

@_date: 2014-07-31 12:17:21
Bitcoin value is down 20% until its up 50% it's very very volatile at this stage in its infancy. This is not the same thing as supply inflation, so don't be confusing them.  Supply inflation is falling rapidly and will be more like 4% by 2017.   With the billions of people on the planet, the increasing demand for bitcoin over the longer term will surpass the supply increases by a wide margin.

This explanation seems flawed to me.  I just generated two dozen private and public keep combinations of which have zero value, because they 'contain' no cryptocurrency units. This knowledge has no value to anyone, because anyone can generate their own (they are not rare), and I can't use an 'empty' address to send anyone any BTC. Now to say 'it' has worth is silly, because these keypair numbers don't- in and of themselves.  So it brings us back to the question what the BTC 'unit of value' is made of.  It may be rare, but that still isn't entirely what 'it' consists of.  


"So," you ask, "why does it have value?"
It has value simply because it is rare, and something that no one can create at will.

People keep asking why is BTC falling.  Maybe its falling because too many people don't know the level of risk they have keeping their money in it?  Over the past year it's been very volatile!  It's not like its a 'low risk' asset like a GIC, bond fund, or T bill!  Its one of the most speculative things your can 'invest' in. Its a gamble.  The total market cap of the entire bitcoin market is only about 7 billion which is similar to  a midcap stock like say the size of Pinterest. Its also about 1.5% the size of the market capitalization of Apple stock.
Yes over the long time span it may prove to be a stable digital currency that was the best investment of the 21st century. Or it may not. . . (go see what your magic 8 ball says?)
Right now there's fear in the market. Most people are worried they'll be losing money if they hold.
When its falling there's currently more sellers than buyers. And sellers are competing for a sale and increasingly willing to lower their asking price to get it sold. Buyers are increasingly lowering their bid price, and less willing to overpay as its likely to drop further.  
The average price for the past 200 days on Bitstamp is only around $520 US so it could still easily come down to that before enough buyers are interested again.  Its had such a massive run up so quickly since a year ago, became overpriced and the bubble popped. Now the market is looking to find the 'base price'.

This is a good mantra for the cryptocoin developer community.  If BTC is too complex and not user friendly enough it will prevent widespread public adoption.  Easy to use, safe and trustworthy wallet apps are so important. Mycelium is a big improvement in this stage of BTC infancy

Seriously he has a point.  Be willing to wash dishes, stock shelves, dig holes, whatever it takes to find some work. If you actually need money then you can find work. Resume and ask at every place you can think of and fill out the application forms.  Go to employment centers.

It's pretty awesome. 
But it's worth considering some unforeseen events where you'd be SOL:
- like losing your phone (with no backup)
- your phone get's bricked for some strange reason (it happens). 
- There's a big powerouttage like the big blackout of 2003 where you've got no wifi and 3G/4G wireless eventually runs out of power as well. 
- there's an EMP strike or solar storm which knocks out the net for a looooong time.

Great explanation, and much appreciated! 
 I think a large part of the answering what a 'bitcoin unit' is, might be better understood by looking at it's genesis.   
The 'genesis block' (block 0) is the first block in the block chain.    It contains only one transaction, the coinbase, which gives 50 BTC to address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa  Strangely enough today this address has received 912 transactions and now has over 65 BTC! From what I've read this cannot be sent or spent.   The transaction hash: 4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b
 It contains a line in the code which generated the first 50 BTC: CTxOut(nValue=50.00000000 
The genesis block is apparently now hardcoded in the software as the starting point for the chain.
You can look at it here:
A short and interesting entry at  comments on this idea that 'bitcoin units' are created out of thin air.  In it is hidden a reference to how a central bank gives bailout money to banks.  Perhaps some similarities exist between how bitcoins are created and central banks create money?

Giving family and friends some BTC to introduce them, and showing them how to use it and where they can spend it is a nice start.    
But for the average consumer, people need to see the easiest and safest way to convert USD into BTC. There's far far too many scams and "fastcoin" type startups that aren't legit.   
People need to have available access to a trustworthy, and low cost ATM nearby.

Get comfortable with how to safely use your wallet app.
Deal with smaller amounts until you are more familiar and comfortable with working with some BTC apps and the whole workflow. Losing $ dealing with a tenth BTC is a lot less to worry about than 10 BTC.
Don't make the same mistake as many who have 'lost' their bitcoin accidentally.  This can happen easier than you'd like.

Is bitcoin 'just a number'? Yes obviously in digital communications its all just 1s and 0s.  But when a transaction occurs, we're not just sending and receiving a hash for each coin, are we? There's inputs and outputs and much more going on.
Yes the dollar is a piece of paper but is Much more than that as well.  I have piles of paper on my desk, worth nothing but garbage.   But USD bills have the force of the government backing it as well as other international govts, let alone global commerce. The govt has a tax base for its income and the federal reserve to supply money. The country maintains trade with other countries through import and export.  The economy GDP is massive. It is backed by the government (and at one point backed by actual gold in thew fed vaults).
 Each printed bill also has an anti counterfeit design so its unique to prevent everyone from printing their own.  Its also backed by the law (secret service) to jail anyone who does counterfeit.

I think we're going to see the price hold at  around $555 or so.  Its bottomed at this price a few times before.

Some of the most successful stocks of all time rise above $500. The price level  doesn't prevent people from buying it because the stock value is worth it. See Berkshire Hathaway for example or GOOG.  The problem with your idea is that BTC is not a stock, it is not a company and has no earnings. Its much harder to value and figure out its actual worth.  That is why people think it may be not worth the price.
BTC is somewhat like virtual gold, a troy oz is a unit that won't change... It is what it is. The gold price keeps climbing as the centuries go buy. People buy fractionals if they think one gold bar/coin costs too much to afford.
BTC wallets are already showing the value of smaller mbtc units, which is similar to what your suggesting.  I'm not buying a full BTC which is too expensive for me, but I'll might buy a tenth...(if the price doesn't keep dropping 10%  every month!

This "KYC" policy is starting to pop up all over the place in the past few years. Not only for bitcoin but where other financial transactions and commodities are purchased.  Its also happening internationally. 
 My best guess is that global government have legislated this. (I'll bet they say its to "fight terrorists"). Its not like these institutions are now doing it because they love to piss off their customers.  They're forced to do it.
Talk about 'marketing' ... Know your customer... Sounds pretty nice!

Just tested using bitaddress.org v 2.9.3 and the bulk generated BIP38 encrypted private key did decode in the June 25 version of bitcoinpaperwallet.com so that's good, it looks like they're compatible now. 
I'll trash the other BIP38 wallets I've generated using the old version 2.8.1 that are empty and incompatible.  When it comes to being able to decode BIP38 wallets the more compatible options the better!
Hopefully our little conversation here can help anyone else who runs into the same problem trying to decrypt their paper wallets made on older using older versions.

This could be pretty much it in a nutshell (and a catch 22?)  For the public to 'gain faith' in the BTC network, and adopt it,  they will need to understand how it is 'currency', what it is, and what gives it value.   Maybe what will give bitcoin some real backing is when the private sector starts to have confidence and invest.  If and when BTC becomes 'backed' by the fortune 500, that would certainly help give consumers confidence in this new cryptocurrency experiment. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:01:19
This is the best answer I've read yet. And it hammers home the point even more that we need a clear explanation for the public to understand what a BTC itself is.  Too many explanations just gloss over this essential question and say its an account and a record of exchange.  And most people immediately ask, "of what?".  And either there's no clear answer (or the explanation is something so convoluted the question remains, the potential user loses faith or interest in BTC ).
Too many advocates of BTC expect the public to adopt BTC and want to have BTC simply because it currently has value in exchange for dollars, commodities, goods or services.  Eventually this attraction wears off and the serious economic questions of what backs the value of a BTC, what its worth and why. And IMHO it boils down to what its made of.

I hear you. Anyone lucky enough to hold that amount of BTC has to be careful with the kind of sell orders they enter, because yes if they flooded the market all at once it could force the price down.  It would likely cost them some profits for executing trades poorly.   The exchanges maybe should have some system in place to protect against this effect?
Another risk is the "Black Monday" effect from out of control not trading. Again, exchanges should maybe have a system in place to protect against this? 
Yes bitcoin is a fairly risky "investment" with high volatility.  This  doesn't mean that the overall fundamentals for investing in BTC over the long term are bearish.  Manage your positions and dont  invest what you can't afford to lose.

Yes, digital financial transactions have been around for decades.  But this proprietary technology was the property of large financial institutions.  It's become more democratized with time.  Initially only a clerk at the bank could wire money, then eventually ATMs, paypal and so on.  But up until now you had to use a technology owned and controlled by a financial institution.  Cryptocurrency is more decentralized and you can own it.  It's more like 'digital gold' or a commodity in that sense which can be owned and traded privately by individuals.   That is perhaps why it will become so widely used and accepted by the average person.  Maybe never as much as cash, the USD, or credit cards, but who knows for sure really?  I remember when the experts said that digital photography could never replace film photography as an industry standard.  It all changed in about 10 years. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:53:39
Yes we can divide each unit up into tiny fractions as required.  However knowing we can use 21 million units as the maximum 'supply' helps when attempting to value what a bitcoin is fundamentally worth. 
For example, if we take the 9 billion dollar market cap value of Western Union and divide that by 21 million shares we end up with a share price of $428.57 per share.    If we take the market cap of  Moneygram at $759 million and divide by 21 million shares we get $36.14.

I keep coming across ATMs which charge too much at 7 - 10% above market 'spot' price.  I'd love to see a machine that charges 3% or a $3 flat fee, but I've not seen that yet.  
A reason why you might want to use a bitcoin ATM where you lose 5% of your money instantly?   Good question.  Here's a few ideas from the top of my head. I'm sure other reddittors who are more familiar with bitcoin can give better insight than me as well. 
  You trust the ATM but you don't trust 'some guy' on localbitcoins.com
 You want the bitcoins now at your convenience and not 'later' when you schedule a meeting with a seller in person. 
 You want to buy a small amount of bitcoins.  Many sellers only conduct sales or sell near market price IF you buy $500 or more BTC at a time. 
 You don't trust the sketchy looking websites that offer to instantly sell you bitcoins.  Many reviews from buyers say they weren't happy with the service where they didn't get the stated price and the BTC weren't sent until days after they wired their money. 
 You don't want to have to go through the pain of registering and opening an account and having to wait until you get "verified" and so on. 
 You don't want to have to upload your ID, and provide other personal information to 'some company' because you're concerned about identity fraud and other important privacy issues.  
 The ATM can be so straight forward that after you've used it once you know what to expect and there's little chance of being surprised by some unexpected change in the transaction.  Which can easily occur when dealing with new people all the time. 
  Yes you can use a charles Schwab debit account with all it's perks.  You probably should if its good.  But it's like comparing apples and oranges.  Bitcoin has it's own advantages and risks.

With cash I pass over little slips and someone prints numbers on a ledger book saying I now have X dollars in my account. With gold I can measure the # of ounces or grams of pure metal and write that down.  In both these traditional currencies I can write the units owned on a Leger, but there is still the 'thing' itself. I can hold 10 fifty dollar bills which are legal tender bills backed by the good faith of the government.  If I have 'stock certificates' each share is one unit of ownership of a publicly traded company.  In all example there is a record of trade ( the ledger) and the 'thing' which is the  unit of value which is being exchanged.
BTC must consist of more than just  ledger which is the record of exchange, other wise the BTC unit of value would be only 'nothing'.
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:23:35
If you paid a low markup over the going market price, then you did well.  Give the price some time to move up and then you can sell some of your BTC for higher than you paid for it.  Investing is all about buy low and sell higher.  BTC is very volatile and high risk investing.  Good luck!

Excellent and imporant questions, which I hope we get all the answers to. 
I think for widespread bitcoin adoption to happen, there needs to be a simple, transparent workflow to follow.  I'm no expert on this stuff but I can comment on:
A) Yes save bitcoinpaperwallets.com onto a USB and boot an offline computer from USB running a live linux distro.    The bitcoinpaperwallets has a verify tab where you can scan in the QR code for the BIB38 private key and see if it decrypts properly.  Another good resource for generating BIP38 addresses offline is with bitaddress.org.
E) I think you're best to memorize it.  If you must write it down you might be best to use keepassx or write it by hand in a notebook you will keep in a safe place.
