12 or 24 there are predictive words.
It's magnitude easier to implement a sequential tracker for the set of special BIP39  words in row you enter that trigger online/offline/hardware malware, that want's to steal "your" coins, than scanning all your input's or datastream for any 32 Bytes you enter or send, that if multiplied by G and hashed 256 and riped match any valid utxo set ( an address with spendable output  )  
So if you want to be on the safe side never use  BIP39 and HD derived keys.
Type in the hex, maybe use encrypted datamatrix codes that you printed on paper or marked in gold or steal and sign your transactions offline on old hardware that never was online or will be online. 
And then use an air gap i.e scan multiple barcodes or QR code to assemble the transaction on the online target machine to broadcast your transaction.

the market will always bid a price for segwit of/chain coins ( signed transactions ) , maybe at a discount but exchange rate for other assets is always volatile even onchain and as long you post the latest state at some point every state of the utxo set  will be mined.  I even would vote for reduce blocksize to sustain for ever a full node possible for everyone to run.

The loneliness of the genius is always as big as his mistakes.
The difference between most else coins and him is that he would admit his mistakes and that he would also be capable and would pursue to correct them or even improve from where he or others fucked up things.
In that sense a Satoshi is more than a Beale cipher[ mystery treasure hunt.
Long live the spirit of its dead inventor!

I am almost certain that there is one right now copying and encoding the chain to RNA, one doing microfiche of the whole chain and a third engraving all in gold foil or copy the chain to cdrom.
As long as your key or seed is on paper or encoded in the three methods mentioned above, after some short time rf radio will work again with simplest methods ( some current or high voltage a blue diamond or minerals or gems and a rolex is enough to build a good transmitter and receiver ) even the internet will emerge as it was build for this scenario ( tcp works even on sneakernet ).  Difficulty will drop and coinbase rewards will not work out well for every miner some altruism will kick in,  but blocks will be mined and distributed and one world chain will emerge as the longest.
Long live Bitcoin and the spirit of its dead inventor.  Who I would always want to be aside me in the lonely island or undiscovered land scenario B-)

Bitcoin is constructed to have a roundabout 25% price/value per anum increase, as investor or participant you can only decide on what side of the curve you want to hedge.  The ratio will be at some point a constant, and the aggregated value will represent the world value.  Today expressed in a $ price roundabout 75666.666.666.666 $   [  ( that's the sum for what you can buy all issued debt , what makes you in legal terms , the owner of the world )
1 Bitcoin correct valued should buy you at any time roundabout  0.000004 % of the world.  So get your share, when it's still a bargain :-)
Private and corporate debt, is always roundabout 2 times bigger.  In sum we are at this writing above 210.000.000.000.000 $  what is still 21.000.000 Bitcoin.  So for that sum you can get not only the governments land but also all the the factory's all the corporate and also every souls private debt.  So do your math and guess the value of 1 Bitcoin.

So probably they will try to compensate with AI like systems ( family, peer groups, tribes, fascists state ) or pure KYC/AML GOD like AI.  This will end in book burning.
It makes no sense to allow ppl that can not be responsible for there acts to have a say at all.
Ppl who can't figure out what bitcoin is, should not have easy access to it.  Mass adoption is nothing we should work for or provide any help at all.

I know this is strange, since we all know its mathematical flat.
And that only time  ( whatever this is ) gives us this 3D illusion. 
While I must assume I am only a part of this simulation, I strongly can confirm, that the effort to make me believe the Earth is not flat, is impressively consistent done on all parts ( continents ) , times and altitudes  I checked by myself.

Whatever works to exchange cheap, hidden and final, keys to the Bitcoin POW chain utxos, will win the race for fungible e-currency.  LTC, MW, LN you name it, they all will have at the end this purpose.  Bitcoin POW needs not much fancy new crypto at all, if used as final accepted ledger to the state of the interim subchain balances.

Even total strangers leave traces, i.e. a while ago a nerd who had to show program skills on twitch forced by his company had perfectly done all what is possible to hide, really impressive, but I was 50% sure that the location we should believe is somewhere in Africa, is false. 
I suspected US, so on one lucky day in background I heard thunder and possible rain.
So I checked weather radar world wide, and oh lucky only 3 thunderstorms that hour in whole US and even better, one at only a small island direct near a big  interstate road that correlates with road bumper noise I assumed.
Bingo, some search of 10 office buildings in the near and there it was.  We have to face the truth that our tech had made the world as small as a little town, you can not hide, you can only hope you have friends that stand before you, when the waves come on to you.

It's true the laws of discrete numbers which evolve to physics and as a derivative human psycho imprint patterns in statistics that can be exploited , despite the fact that they assumed as random, they are not.
I financed partly my study's by discovering that.
Today this is exploited massively by chart analysis and crafted system bets in gaming.  Which averages out clear visibility of that, but back then, when I crafted the first computer charts and lottery system bets, it was like magic money printing which obviously bored me fast.

Right.  one should only talk labels if the assigned programs are interpreted ( have equal meaning ) by all talkers the same way.
i.e. I doubt that the reference "Bolshevik" when dealt with Googles bias to crypto means the same when facing the "Bolshevik" cold boot in your face.
There are many honest reasons to not entangle a biased name ( label ) even if it is yours to a program.      
I doubt the screenplay Red Pawn 
and Atlas Shrugged, both from A. Ran(t)d, could be anticipated correct out of the time context, no matter how you label them.

I would not bet much on QC.
There is a big chance, that the whole proposed speed up is an Q illusion scam, because what you in effect do, if you look at the math and design of QC, they  just use the same circuit in effect at many different times in past and future ( extreme short jitter, but not zero ). So there are some overall timing problems they can not overcome.
You read it here first, QC sucks, I am from the future and Bitcoin is there still the most valuable coin. :-)

Big senders might try in the future to prove it was there input by blind sign the signing of any transaction with a refund address off the sender.  So it might be possible to setup a site/protocol  where the sender can prove there previous input owner ship and award a bounty.
@_date: 2019-09-05 08:51:59
Refund and take the bounty !  Since I know then, it was not there intended will.
When other circumstance speaks for that you deserved the coins take it, nobody can prevent that, since Bitcoin is permission less.
Suppose someone wants to fund you or has agreed to pay you indirectly or give you a credit, but he can not commit to in public, for many reasons.
To take the Bounty, can prevent many tragic boating accidents.

hold your line, 0-Bitcoin all lost in a "tragic boat accident"
@_date: 2019-05-09 07:15:23
After or before the annual Blockchain Week Pump ?
Better question how probable is that a big exchange lost some keys in a tragic boat accident versus lost only some tx not backed by there own keys at all ?
