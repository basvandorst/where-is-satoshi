Super cool of you guys - thank you for the opportunity and merry Christmas!

They could sell them for scrap - it's already clear they're in the green since those expenditures are factored in to the most recent profit announcements. Recouping costs would be nice but again, it's really just a hit to them, not nearly a death blow.

Jihan is proud, perhaps blinded by pride, but not stupid. If times get desperate, I would fully expect them to artificially pump BCH to an acceptable level and wade in the green for a little while longer - or just long enough to sell the company to an unsuspecting fool.

PM me. I might be able to help you out with this.
Like OP, I've got some spare space that could serve you well.

I mean they're still far in the green, and could liquidate the extra gear if they wanted to, but they won't because they're doing the suspected usual BITMAIN thing with it: mining on gear before they sell it. If they don't manage to sell it or mining becomes unprofitable, they'll just liquidate and accept the minor hit.

You'd be paying residential prices for electricity, would have to likely redo the wiring hardcore, can't get insurance because it'd be a massive fire/total loss risk, and PA isn't exactly known for its solar prowess.
That fantasy isn't getting more feasible, dude...

Show proof?

As someone with $40 in his wallet I cannot believe that $350,000 was traded to annihilate that single sell order and move the price one cent up.
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:49:43
We're not on reddit 24/7 dude, slow down. Anyway yeah that doesn't look good, you're going to want to send this to the GDAX team by their support email or failing that by their twitter.

Bitcoin miners (especially current-gen) convert a more than reasonable amount of input electricity (&gt;80%) into heat. You could *possibly* recoup your prices depending on your electricity v. natural gas costs and skimp on heating for your house provided you're willing to engineer some solutions. Just putting your miners in your basement will not work if you have any upper levels to your house (and even then, it won't distribute heat well) If you have to pay someone else to redo your heating, you're not going to make ROI.
This (though not exactly current) may provide some other useful info.

The R4 is not a "no fan" miner. It has a fan, it's just a better/more efficient fan than other miners. So it's not silent either, just reasonably quiet.

I couldn't find a reputable source before I needed to head off, so I low balled it by a lot - just in case.

I'll take a free ~$7 any day, it'll help me flee the country if I need to after this shit show is over.
All the best luck to you, OP. 1D7RqmMhfEsmFtDsc75q9MM8PLZwXRuF38

Peer-reviewed by... who? That sounds like a great way for me, the peer reviewer, to totally bypass $x original author and claim those sweet BTC from you directly.

What's for dinner, u/deliver-truth? uwu
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:26:58
Sure can. But they'll probably file a brief report. I can't imagine them actually doing anything, since it would be far beyond their ability to execute/not worth the time :(
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:22:42
Or shoot me a PM and we could work something out for free.
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:57:01
In the future, never 'invest' over any social media platform. Sorry about all this, it sucks to figure it out the hard way :(
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:56:01
Don't send them more money. Screenshot everything, then block them.
Consider what you've already sent to be a costly lesson.
Collect all the information you can and file a report with the police. Consider contacting Instagram about it as well. But you're probably never seeing that money back.

I would be willing to do the hosting for this (for free) but I would not be interested in doing the coding for this website, a bit much on my plate right now to commit to developing another project.

The xNT chips are 2mm by 10mm cylinders. They are injected under the skin by a reasonably fat needle, thus the "little poke."
Source: also have an xNT, not for cryptocurrency storage though :)

Wise man. Gotta respect the $5 wrench.
@_date: 2018-11-11 18:47:26
Naive. :(
Run the calculations yourself. Find out what you pay for electricity. Factor in the extremely high electricity cost that this will incur. Factor in a steady decrease in profitability. Start looking at [reviews]( of the site you're looking at (one claimant does not a scam make, but it's worth thinking about). Look for reviews of the equipment itself from trusted sites and companies. Consider talking to a financial adviser since you clearly cannot afford this on your own so they can start hammering in the point "never invest what you cannot lose."
You'll find that details on this device are limited, most "vendors" of it are scammers, the company's site uses manipulative tactics to try to push you to buy faster, the site also tries to push you to use their cloud mining service (ask on r/BitcoinMining why that's problematic), profitability has been steadily decreasing (which is conveniently not factored in), etc.

What does the client that you sent it from say?
And no, it will not bounce back if it gets ignored - once pushed to the mempool, you can mostly count on a transaction to get confirmed eventually, unless there was a major global failure that clears the mempool. But we try not to have that happen ;)
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:53:21
You always say that. In your post history I only find instances of you saying that, same with the people who I have linked that have looked before - all times you are asked for proof you say "go look, it's there" or challenge people to wager on whether or not you're lying. There is no further proof to be found, you have unverified claims everywhere about your lab, your multiple companies, etc. If you want to be taken seriously, it's time to actually reply to the legitimate concerns that people are voicing, instead of just deferring people.

Again, this is *all you have ever said*. You think people have lives here? This is r/bitcoin. We've looked. I've looked. You have so many unverified claims that if these statements were made in court you'd be on the stand for perjury.
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:31:08
My beef with this is that he has repeatedly said he would provide proof for all of these claims, and yet hasn't bothered to in a year of making these statements. Individually, they're not hard to believe. Together, they're highly improbable, and in this thread we are getting *yet again* the "I will" response from him when asking for proof. Like they say, pics or it didn't happen.

Your private key must remain secret at all times. By posting it here, someone quickly used that key to move your Bitcoin - it is the equivalent of posting your QQ login credentials, people would quickly log in to your account. No "hacker" needed, no problem with your computer wallet, this is human error. You will not get those funds back unless the person who took them is very generous... Sorry for your loss. :(
