Look, I'm not the murderous gang, even though I may look like it, but the people I'm going after are the truly murderous gang, and they have only the single intention of getting power to use violence to make themselves better, regardless of the consequences to everyone else, whether they are in our Group or not. Can't you see I'm trying to make things better for all, and once I eridicate this murderous gang (I'll just call them PE - "problem elements"), I'll make sure things get back on the path they were supposed to be, and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Block Chain v2 will be fantastic. I've listened to your ideas, and I think you are definitely one of the best people to put in charge of the new Republic, and once things settle down, I'll push to have your name in the election booth, maybe even higher up in the list than some others ( you know who I'm talking about). I just need to maintain a small force of well armed security forces, and a few provisions in the law to allow me to "rectify things", like keeping passwords, tokens, secret block-chains, monitoring of potential transfers of assets, secret backdoors to all computers systems, and investigative powers on any attempts to circumvent my security forces. That's all, I'm sure you'll find I'm being completely reasonable, but I'm thinking of your children, and the fact that once, a little while ago, somebody's kids just vanished off the street, which we all know is the MO of those PE. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but at least I'm trying to improve the situation given the resources we have, which may not be much if we delay on this move.
  
Think of the children!
