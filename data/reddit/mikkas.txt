Oh it's not over yet. "Estimated" ship day of Jan 26 on a Dec 11 order.
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:26:53
Buyer beware, I've been waiting for "in stock" to be shipped since ordering last December. According to support they have "no control" of stock levels or delays.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:30:15
We'd come to Tokyo in an instant, but it won't be confirmed for a while.
@_date: 2014-03-13 11:41:03
Make sure you film it with an iPhone though
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:40:55
Yeah my only issue was stock was "2 in stock" where in fact it should have been a 0.
@_date: 2014-03-08 10:46:17
Finally someone gets the joke. Funny thing is that it took hours to confirm.
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:15:00
I just say it's the "next paypal" and explain it's like bittorrent for money, in the sense that there is no middleman in-between the buyer and seller.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:15:04
I think that's really generous of you and awesome for the community. I haven't worked out bitcoin tips yet but am just talking to people about bitcoin and helping where I can. I think it all adds up.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:43:07
That's no moon..
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:48:19
Si =D
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:23:05
Honestly, I'd find a bitcoin faucet, or even investigate a Dogecoin faucet (you'll have more 'coin' to play around with).
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:16:23
Great stuff, subscribed. Here's hoping it takes off!
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:47:27
Check through my profile or the search bar, but yes there are a few. The main one is Bitcoin Starter.
Here's an example  - obviously not as many hits as we may get on Kickstarter, but I really want to see if the community here gets behind us. Otherwise we'll have to take the fiat route.
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:54:59
We got screen printed (26x13") plastisol ink yes. Then paid about 50c to heat press each one to give a cool shimmer effect. This was last time. Planning on doing the same again, so we can possibly do black on black and white on white.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:17:34
We actually have that idea listed on the Bitcoin starter page :)
Once (or "if") we launch, that will be a special shirt you can only get with BTC ;) 
Other shirts we will have an option for both methods of payment.

Our Bitcoin Black Friday Sale is LIVE :) Check our  out! 
We are so excited to see what happens!!

Invest in some Good BitcoinStarter projects. Keep the economy growing.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:28:35
can help, but renting is just so much less stress for me personally. If the rent is too high where OP lives get a roof to live under, or heck, take a holiday (pay with BTC for flights!) or maybe even consider a move.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:18:39
Molly Machine. We do funky robot shirts and stuff. You can see our deal there on BBF, or go straight to the deal (Live now) here: 
Curious on your feedback!
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:35:04
I was going to offer it as an option of Pledging. People could send an amount, email me, and I'd keep a record. Unless you think that's a bad idea and I'd have to look into an escrow service?
If we didn't reach our cash goal I could then contact the bitcoin pledgers and send back the bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:53:59
I'm saving this post so I will certainly keep you guys in mind for future. I had problems finding good quality printers in China so we are going to use our indie guy again in NYC (we own the screens but they keep them. Apparently it's pretty standard practise.).
Because winter is coming we might do some hoodies as well. Like I said, it will all depend on the interest gathered on Kickstarter -- once I actually launch one. I want to plan everything out correctly first and not rush into it! :) Thanks for your reply.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:12:01
19 I think
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:10:53
There's also  --- or even local bitcoin groups that meetup (meetup.com might have one near you)
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:07:46
Yes I agree. Well at least the positive side to this negative is that we will be forced to hold onto the bitcoins, or sell to friends or friends of friends!
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:08:32
Yes I'm big on only using my own funds. I don't think I'd ever tell someone to invest, even though I'm a bit of a believer this will all take off at some point soon.

Great book, also enjoyed Ready Player One
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:44:51
Thank you for this. I am really glad Bitcoin is getting so much TV time as of late. Looking forward to the next 11 days/episodes.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:47:13
Yeah I've been pushing for AM radio coverage.. but no luck just yet.
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:40:27
That's not raining at all, we have sold about 100 shirts in the past, so we already have Screens made, and previous sales, and about 250 likes on facebook, 400 twitter followers.
The idea of this Kickstarter is to see if people out there in this community and others might be interested. Some examples of the past shirts are here  (we have sneakers, 6 designs, and 6 new designs we want to get funded. 6 original designs already have the screens, packaging, and stickers already made and ready to go).
I've been working on this company for about a year now, have a business plan, and a lot of the planning already worked out. The kickstarter will be a deciding factor on a) if there's any interest, and b) if it goes well it will be our 2.0 re-launch. :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:36:36
They could even comment on the blockchain payment their pledge amount or a reference number (emailed to me) so I could keep track of it all. What do you think about that?
Obviously I'd still be accepting cash pledges as normal, but have Bitcoin as an option for people like the Bitcoin reddit community to pledge that way if they preferred.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:00:00
Is deposit address my "public address" ? I wasn't sure.
I've been meaning to finally get this tipping stuff sorted out, but reading this post has finally made me jump in. Hopefully I did it right?
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:36:52
Damn. Well I'm hoping more aussies are better trusted, as I'd love to see BTC succeed here. Planning on starting a localbitcoins account (purely to spread the word and meet in person with people into BTC). So hopefully new accounts can be trusted as well (otherwise how do we get good feeback?)
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:59:13
I accept that she's accepting Bitcoin, but I don't think I'll be purchasing anything by her.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:10:07
Thank you so much! I hope we don't have to go down the Kickstarter route... But I suppose it's in the hands of the Bitcoin gods now! :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:22:37
This is make or break for our T-shirt biz on BBF. Hopefully people are in a spending mood! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:34:54
Hi -- yes, this is exactly like Kickstarter.
If we get enough donations we go ahead with the production full time. If you donate and the project does not get 100% funded you get 100% of your BTC refunded (no fees). If you donate today I'm keeping a record of each transaction/pledge &amp; will refund $5 off the total pledge. Heck I might even throw in a free shirt if we get enough pledges today as a thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:21:58
I tried to scan that QR code.. does it actually work?

Haha thanks! I know the site isn't as big as kickstarter, but hopefully the community get behind it!

2nd'ed. Fellow Aussie here.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:13:43
Thanks for helping the community out. Without people spending or even donating some to friends I don't see Bitcoin ever taking off. Luckily we are generous pioneers! :D
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:10:53
I listed my T-Shirt project on BBF, but got 0 sales. 
I guess people would rather buy than "pledge" Bitcoin on the Black Friday sale day. A true shame! Guess I'll have to do a Kickstarter instead. I suppose fiat isn't dead just yet.
Even with that disappointing and bad news, it didn't stop me picking up a bargain though myself &amp; driving forward the economy by spending some coin.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:37:00
Best bay of my life :')
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:06:56
Yes I think we will set a low target goal, and then after that give the Bitcoin option. That'll be the least confusing way for everyone I think.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:47:27
So is your super $ now BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:02:46

Woo! Fingers crossed for our Molly Machine T-Shirts :D 
I just picked up some cool collectible Bitcoin Physical coins.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:10:58
Yes and no, the people I know at ABC don't want to talk about bitcoin generally &amp; most of my friends aren't interested. But they'll slowly come around.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:02:45
You little ripper!
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:05:49
Awesome! Go for it I say... I honestly think the only way is up! (with some ups and down corrections of course)
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:55:55
True that's a good point. There are bitcoin only kickstarters out there but they're not as popular as kickstarter.
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:54:29
We might end up saving the world a lot of wasted paper if eventually everything went to digital receipts. That's really cool to think about.
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:28:26
Even if you think it's a bad idea, I'd love some constructive criticism! I'm on a chat group in china and they said I should post up on this sub to see if there'd be any interest.
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:57:41
Same. Looking forward to them. They're also on ebay for a bit cheaper if you buy them one by one.
Hopefully someone picks up my Molly Machine T-Shirt deal soon on BBF :D
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:55:05
I use btcReport, looks very pretty.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:12:44
That's a really good point. 6260% looks like a heap, but once you divide it all up... yeah. Still, I'm happy some people got sales &amp; bitcoin is actually being used as currency.
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:31:19
someone needs to shop that with a btc flying out &lt;3
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:09:31
Yeah that really sucks. Once you're in and verified it's all gravy. Everyone had to wait the little period. It's worth the wait at least!
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:45:22
Happy to help a fellow noob out. I'd go for localbitcoins or coinjar. Feel free to ask me any questions.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:14:15
You're awesome! We can't grow bitcoin unless we keep spending or at least spreading the love with some friendly donations :D
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:43:15
Oh and as a t-shirt print shop owner do you do screen printing? Would you accept bitcoin? I'm hopeful we can convince our screen printer in NYC to accept bitcoin as payment in future.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:34:02
Achievement unlocked.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:06:17
Oh it is so on now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:20:17
Grabbed the Bitcoin logo, 
did some quick MS Paint hacking, and made my kindle screensaver picture.
To get instructions on how to jailbreak.
So now when I'm out selling T-Shirts, I can just show my Kindle for payment! Easy! :)
PS, Molly Machine is a T-Shirt company I'm hoping to Kickstart... with Bitcoin! If you wanted to know more here is a link to the project:

I think the moves get made before the words are said.

Are you saying you can withdraw our super?? Wow!
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:28:51
Just start small, look into paper wallets and have a play around with them. There's plenty of good youtube videos out there as well.

Hopefully our T-shirts sell on the day! (We're doing pledges, but refunding a $5 amount off for BitcoinBlackFriday)
Here's 2 things I've submitted in the past about it if anyone was curious about Molly Machine:
And also a cool way to show a QR code on a Amazon Kindle screensaver:
Looking forward to buying some lollipops on the day! :)

@_date: 2013-12-09 05:05:51
Maybe he should accept dogecoin.
Much wow
Very crypto
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:58:57
We would basically have a BTC public (preorder or donation) QR code at the bottom, and also offer just regular payment with Kickstarter. We would hold the bitcoin until the project reached the goal or the time limit ran out.
If people used the QR code they could comment with their payment, and also send us an email as a record. If kickstarter hits the goal and the project starts, all good.
If the project doesn't reach the cash goal, I could go back to the emails and transfer the bitcoin back to each pledge/donation.
Does that make a bit more sense?
