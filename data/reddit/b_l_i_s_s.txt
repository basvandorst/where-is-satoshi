Yup it's easy as fuck for them unless you tumble the coins.. Which has fees involved   more fucking fees ugh.   So no I said no to tumbling and just swapped from wallet to wallet.   They might have been keeping an eye on me... I know people that took coin directly from circle and sent it to a dnm to buy dope and never got shut down but they only did it once.   I bought thousands in coins and always did the same thing so they probably caught on.   But they were all legal rc benzos.   What the fuck... I was actually hurt that day I went to buy more coin and found out I was banned.   Because it never got easier than circle

Yeah.  My chase card flagged the little deposit they make and refund so you can prove its your card as fraud so they never accepted the card.   No explanation or anything the card went from pending to gone.   So I tried again.   Gave them all that personal info and the pics, waited, same thing.   So I asked wtf was up.   Then I see in my email that charges (50-60 Cents were flagged for fraud) what the fuck?!   I get its weird but that's how a lot of these companies make sure its your card

 You did not search first if you made this post.   Unfortunately 
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:14:16
You should have and could have searched first.    
But im on the fuck circle bandwagon too.   Fuck them.  After thousands bought from them they blacklisted me for a legal rc purchase after transferring the coin from wallet to wallet five times (I've never been a tumbler).   But that was quite a while ago.   Now to see they don't sell anymore I just laugh.   Probably ended up banning so many people it wasn't worth it

Damnit that's what I was thinking..oh well thanks for the help man

Does coinbase still take cards?  Could have sworn I just tried the other day and the only option was bank transfer but it could have been another site.  Was in a frenzy trying to find the right site

Weird...I just get this:
  
Seems like bank or money transfer.  I'll try on my PC later.  Just strange

Depends...they gave me a weekly limit of only $100 and have denied my last two requests for a raise...I've made four $100 buys over four weeks.  If you have a bank account, link it and the limit goes up to $2500.  If you opened an account when they first started, you got a $500 a week limit so the new limit sucks.  They also ask for a picture of your drivers license and a selfie of you holding it.  I know that bothers some people

Yup, awaiting my bank account to verify.

Thanks.  The only decent reply here.  Much appreciated 
Except none of them accept card so far just banks.  Bah 
Looking to buy with a card, hell even if it's another site that has a $100 limit.  I'll combine circle and the new one for a mere $200.  That's still better than $100

Always do!  Well last time the only Wells Fargo available at the time had less but it went well had coins within a half hour when he got online even though I don't have a ton of buys.  I just heard about funds not coming out of escrow for a bit but never heard if it was resolved or not.
Thanks for the quick reply sir.  Will be waking up early to get a buy in before work
