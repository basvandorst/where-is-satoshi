This is good news

Just do it. Think what else you could be doing with that money. Think about what you have read everywhere else.
Use your head and think, is this a good calculated risk?

As far as I'm concerned as a Canadian Bitcoin trader, they are the best Canadian exchange out there. Cavirtex sucks. These guys have proved themselves to be reliable and continuously update their site for the better.
No complaints, and have been using them since November.

Take a look at Vault of Satoshi. They have both a CAD exchange and a USD exchange.

Do you think it's possible to stitch together price history from multiple exchanges, dating back since the inception of the Bitcoin, and kinda gauge what *THE* price would've been? And do so accurately?

Thank you.

Cavirtex, the largest Canadian Bitcoin exchange, has disabled all Bitcoin withdrawals and deposits as of 5:57 PM EST. They say their customer funds are safe, and I'm not sure if related at all to the recent hacks, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

If that's the case, I am curious to know whether it's possible to *estimate* what the price of Bitcoin was, since it's inception.

This is pretty much what I was looking for, thank you. Never heard of this web app before.
I am curious whether there's a way to get a price from an even *earlier* date than what this can do.
