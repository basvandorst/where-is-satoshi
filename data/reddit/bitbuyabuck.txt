Just about any exchange. Search bch exchange. There’s a ton of options, and access to some depend on what country you are in . Also, depending on the exchange, bitcoin cash may have the ticker BCC, but it’s the same thing as BCH(example bittrex).

Step one: create other btc wallet such as mycelium
Step two: to go coinbase and send your modest some of btc to your newly created wallet address
Step three: pay a very high fee and expect to wait awhile
Step four: receive your now even more modest sum of btc at your new wallet address
Step five: anger, denial, acceptance
Step six: dump btc for better crypto

It is hilarious to watch you guys try to rationalize bch gaining ground by yelling “hey no fair!”

This is example is inaccurate because it implies a copyright or patent had been violated in the case of bitcoin... which it has not. 
But let’s explore this anyway...
Is apple unlimited faster than a normal apple? For way less cost? Does it actually function as a decent means of computing? Did apple unlimited strip out the add ons and nonsense that were implemented after Steve’s death with money from the Bilderberg group which he surely wouldn’t have approved of because they directly contradict the entire intent of his white paper? 
Hell, that sounds just fine. I’ll take three, cheers.

Yes you can transfer to gdax for free, but the whole point of this guys whining is that he is mad at coinbase. Gdax= coinbase

It’s likely gone. At least without a hell of a lot more details no one can help you

There is no BTH. Bitcoin cash is BCH or BCC depending on the exchange

The genius plan? Leave it alone (I hope)

Yes please sell. I’m buying. Bitcoin core has been stripped of its utility. Good luck bag hodlers ;)

“Well Alex i think also people confuse bitcoin and bitchain.”
This quote is hilarious.

Thank you for this video. It very clearly describes the reasons I will be divesting my bitcoin assets into not bitcoin. RIP BTC :,(

The bitcoin.com wallet is both for bitcoin and bitcoin cash. So is bitcoin.com. If you think people need to be tricked into using bitcoin cash over bitcoin for commerce, I think you haven’t tried to transact in bitcoin for awhile... you should try it sometime

Ah yes good point

Hold on, you are making a lot of assumptions here. Which exchange will support your hypothetical bitcoin imposter? And which exchange would sell this new btc as “btc”? There would obviously be differences. Also, it is not wise to make a shitcoin copycat without any improvements because this community would quickly call those people out.
Fraud is not ok, but you don’t need a centralized authority to enforce these concepts. The market will naturally, quickly, and efficiently separate the wheat from the chaff. 
Go ahead and create a “bitcoin”  and call it the same, with the same logo and don’t make any improvements to the original code. Or don’t even use any code if you don’t want, after all, it’s a fraud so who cares. Then wait and see how many you sell. Let me know how it goes.

If you want the government to prevent the free market from deciding which coin is superior based on merit, you are part of the problem. 
I am glad you asked this question out loud because a lot of the anarchist bitcoiners still lingering in this subreddit will see this question as a huge red flag, and maybe wake up and realize that core is bunch of nanny stater, gubmint appeasers that wouldn’t know a free market if it sat on their face.
May the best coin win.

Roger stayed true to the philosophy behind bitcoin... For principled investors who understand that the utility of bitcoin is what makes it a store of value, he has been right all along. 
I have been waiting for unconfirmed btc transaction for a ridiculously long time. And the fee was too high. I’m divesting btc for greener pastures. Core can suck it

HODL the line! Buy the dip! I just bought at 10,700 earlier today, but fuck it, This day of trading is fucking nuts. HODL!

HODL you yellow-bellied bastards! HODL

Once you start patenting and copyrighting, it is no longer a decentralized project because you are inviting centralized authority (government) to dictate what is allowed and what is not. 
That is a super slippery slope, and other principled investors like myself will immediately  divest all of bitcoin core if that ever happens.  I really think people are losing the original philosophy of bitcoin because they are threatened by bitcoin cash being a better functioning crypto at the moment, and rather than improve, they want the government to create a protective monopoly for bitcoin. No thank you

Umm in what way is this different from  ?
This idea is old news, and while any alternatives to YouTube censorship domination is welcome, I still see this being a convenience issue. Hell Im hip to Bitcoin and I'm too lazy to try this, let alone the general population
