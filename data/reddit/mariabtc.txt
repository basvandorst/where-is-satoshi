I was/am a heavy e-currency user. These e-currency sites shared the flaw of centralization. Bitcoin caught my interest when I read the word decentralized. 
Back in April 2012 I started a fresh clone of bitcoin called Bytecoin BTE. Its still growing strong as of this moment. coinplorer.com/BTE

Yes you should be able to redeem back in BTC.
I was a Forex-Metal client for more than 5 years and recently they decided to deny my withdrawal request. So, even tho FXmetal does accept BTC I would recommend against using this broker.
I will not suggest any particular broker to you, but once you find and choose one, then i can guide you on how to increase your balance by following my strategy.
Please do intensive reasearch on any broker you are considering for your trading.

Kind of true. The secret is behind the strategy applied. The script just executes the strategy.

I have a better idea. How about you (or anyone) send some coins to the address used in the signature and i'll send them back after 3 confirmations.

Sure. All you need is a broker that accepts BTC for deposits. They then convert to USD the amount of BTC deposited and you trade in USD at the end.

The Original satoshi client had a button that said "start generating" on it. Mining was one click easy on any computer.

That post was indeed created by me. I was trying to teach forex trading to the cryptocomunity. Lots of trolls now that i remember.
