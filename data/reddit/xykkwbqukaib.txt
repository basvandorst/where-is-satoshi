I live and work in San Francisco, CA. As far as I know, there are zero stores or businesses who accept bitcoin (other than the Coinbase folks I know... but that doesn't count). If they do exist they are not well-known or the norm. To me, this means that bitcoin currently has literally zero utility as a "payment mechanism". 
How does this benefit me or anyone else?

You are wrong, it hit $900. Someone sold at $900, so they did not in-fact get "more than" $900 for their sale. 
Even if they had gotten $901, this would not merit the description "rockets past $900". It was at $900 for so short a time you would not have had time to type this post.

Came here to post this. I am utterly baffled people are screaming "crash" when we were literally at this price a few hours ago. 
I really hope Bitcoin can survive the short-term stupidity we are witnessing right now. Even my Facebook wall is full of people bitching about how it didn't hit $1,000. 
It should not have $900 in the first place. Not so quickly that is.

Thus he realizes that the dollar (or he likely hasn't realized this yet) falling/rising in value literally has no consequence on 99% of the American population. Prices of bread or milk literally take decades to truly change (for every day people)... where as bitcoin changes over night. 
You cannot compare the two unless you're delusional.

"After Mr. Ulbricht was arrested last month, the scientists used public information to begin tracing Silk Road-related transactions. Among their discoveries was a particular transfer to an account controlled by Mr. Ulbricht from another that had been created in January 2009, during the very earliest days of the bitcoin network, which was set up the previous year.
Although the authors state that they cannot prove that that account belongs to the person who created the bitcoin currency, it is widely believed that the first accounts belong to a person who identifies himself as “Satoshi Nakamoto,” but who has remained anonymous and has not been publicly heard from since 2010."

A high seller and hundreds of TINY sell orders to further drive it down. 
It should be very obvious by now what's going on.

Ok, let's say I change my statement to **half** my money. Does that change anything about my point as an outsider looking in? 
Keep in mind that I have zero debt, make six figures, have other assets/land, and I'm happy with my life (aka I don't need to go buy a motorcycle or boat, and will be fine for the foreseeable future regardless of said savings). 
Would you still suggest I transfer my money into Bitcoin instead of a traditional bank (as suggested by this sub-reddit)? Would you still suggest I consider bitcoin an alternative to mutual funds or even day trading?

First, let me clarify that none of the merchants you mentioned are anything other than coffee shops. I can't even buy groceries at the stores that are on CoinMap here in SF (corner stores do not count, most don't even have produce). 
So I should believe in a "currency" because an Internet community thinks it is cool? I should put my money into it, instead of a bank, for this reason? I should invest in it, for this reason? 
I'm really baffled by this explanation. Why should merchants accept it? There doesn't seem to be a demand... Why should I buy? Even if merchants accepted it, what do I gain for paying in this extremely hard to use method/"currency"? 
My point here isn't to be an asshole, but to prove a point. Most people do not care about bitcoin, nor will they ever, unless someone makes it dead simple to use and provides some sort of advantage to using bitcoin over cash money dollar bills, yo. 
That's really all there is to it. I'm playing devils advocate to my own self-interests here, but that's why I have money in the first place.

Really? My $70,000 USD isn't losing value on an extremely volatile basis and I can spend it whenever I please. This is fact. My 70k is worth now more than what it was a year ago. I started with $50k and now have $70k, within less than a year. 
How is this possible with your logic? 
Where is this exploding fiat risk you speak of? Your "exploded" is hyperbole and really you're just very enthusiastic, yes? 
How does any of this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:20:55
Yes, let's pump our "currency" as high as possible as fast as possible! Great strategy!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:17:19
These ridiculous posts need to stop. It did not "rocket" past $900, it hit $900 and immediately nose-dived closer to $800 again. 
Stop it.

You basically just convinced me that banks are better than bitcoin...
Banks? Super secure! If an astroid hits the earth, sure you're fucked, but otherwise a-ok kid! 
Bitcoin? Someone attacks you? Entire fortune gone. Extremely new currency crashes? Totally fucked. Complete memory loss due to car crash? Who am I? Poor as fuck? No problem! Who am I again??!?!
Just saying...

I just have a few iPhone apps set to alert me if the price drops below or above various prices, each set for different exchanges (I won't buy on Mt. Gox, but it's still an indication of movement). 
There is literally no point in being obsessive about the charts right now (aka watching on your computer 24/7), we're currently riding a wave of ebb and flow, with a very gradual rise. 
Set alerts so if something crazy happens you know, but otherwise don't lose sleep over it.

For starters, I would like this sub-reddits mods to remove the comparison to a bank from the description (because bitcoin is in no way the same as a bank... I can't lose half my net worth, or triple it for that matter, in a 24 hour period from a bank). 
Which gets to my main point, which is that bitcoin is just as high risk, if not more so, than day trading and should be embraced as such. Instead this subreddit is full of jokes, memes, and shitty advice about buying and selling (like bitcoin is actually something you can reliably buy and sell). 
This sub-reddits description should read: "THIS IS ONE GODDAMN HUGE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT, USE AT YOUR OWN CAUTION! KTHX!"
Or someone should convince me (and quite a few onlookers) otherwise.

Did you really post before reading the rest of the comments/replies? Hell, did you read my fucking description?
Developing "project"? "Facts"? 
I sense a degrading quality in, well, you...
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:39:52
Is this a real reply? Seriously?
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:27:43
Yet this sub-reddits description describes it as an alternative to a BANK? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:25:08
I own quite a few bitcoins. I bought them almost two years ago when the price was nothing, because why not? This has nothing to do with that.
You are correct that this could go well, or it might not, but you're ultimately even MORE correct in that this deserves a massive fucking disclaimer and not an endorsement on it being an alternative to BANKING! This sub-reddit makes the alternative to banking case very clear, which it should not, thus the point of this thread.
I want bitcoin to succeed; I have an invested interest in that happening (when it literally costs a few bucks to get a very large amount of coins, which I promptly ignored until recently), but I do not agree with misleading the misinformed with shit like it's an alternative to your bank!
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:40:24
I'm a bit confused. I don't think you actually answered my question...
I said that there are literally ZERO merchants who will accept my bitcoins in the very large city I live in.
Your reply was that, "if there is nothing you want to buy, then don't"...? Are you kidding? Politics? Really?
