It does a lot of things for a lot of people. But it's impossible to say what that might be for any given person because the range of possibilities is so broad. 
Anyway, advising anyone  to take lsd for political reasons is irresponsible in the extreme. It's an illegal mind-fucking chemical that needs to be approached with a lot of prudence and caution, because lucy is a harsh mistress who does not suffer fools lightly.

It's a civil offense. Just because you can't go to jail doesn't mean it doesn't have legal repercussions. Committing adultery can give your spouse grounds go dissolve your marriage and leave you subject to alimony payments as a result of the legal proceedings of divorce.

You know you're winning an argument (though calling this an argument is really a stretch, since both sides are *supposed* to use logic and reason) when your opponent resorts to saying "YEAH WELL YOU CAN'T GET LAID".

It may be silly but it's not insulting. The value of the average reddit post is absolutely nothing, if someone chooses to pay you even a tiny amount for a comment treat it like what it is -  free money for doing something you were going to do anyway.

It's funny that you think that he's the one losing the argument. Like, actually, legitimately funny.

True, but it's really hard to tell when people are being sarcastic about BTC and when they aren't. Some people legitimately believe BTC would be a viable choice for a national reserve currency (see explanation of LiraCoin for why that's pretty much never gonna happen), etc.

'Drug legalization is an excellent idea guize, look at Portugal!' is a sadly common argument. I agree that we need to change the way we do things, but outright legalization is probably not going to make things better unless there are so many controls on it that it's really not legal. 
Can you imagine if we treated Meth like alcohol? Selling it in every grocery store and putting giant flashy ads up everywhere? 
You can treat drug addiction as a public health problem without doing much beyond decriminalization. As much as I would love to be able to go to the corner store and buy a few hits of acid, I recognize that it's unlikely that in my lifetime society will be ready to handle drugs like that, and in my mind, implementing a solution before it's time may be worse than not implementing a solution at all (if legalization in this case fails to yield promised results the backlash could lead to something far more draconian than we have now).

Like I said in a later comment, tier one schools and the like have facilities that are too valuable. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:16:36
No, I'm referencing the current cost in dollars (plus annual inflation of 2-3%), because any other assumption is really rather silly.
If any government decides to move to cryptocurrency as their reserve, it likely won't be BTC, as it's not particularly difficult to make new ones, and BTC's past volatility has somewhat poisoned it for such purposes. Why would Greece use BTC when they could make LiraCoin, mine a substantial amount of them, and then make controlled exchanges for existing currency to help phase it out?

You could probably afford a university for almost half a billion dollars.

I'd be willing to bet that you'd be able to get just about any tier 2 state school type affair for that kind of dough. Or at least enough influence that you practical ownership if not legal owernship.
You wouldn't be able to get any top tier research school or ivy league universities, though. Facilities are worth far too much. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:23:23
Drugs are still illegal in Portugal, though. There isn't a Meth store you can go to. Any sort of activity that involves more than personal usage amounts is still a criminal offense and is treated as such.

-1 is being downvoted to shit? That's a grand total of two people disagreeing with you. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:42:08
Well, regardless of the total vote count, you're at +0 now, which suggests people think you're smart and insane in equal measures. 
I've done a bunch of lsd (I'd be stunned if you'd done more, not to get into a dick-measuring contest. Point being I am quite experienced) and it didn't 'break me out of the cage of statist thinking', because that's ridiculous. Lsd shows yourself to you - in your case, you feel like it strengthened your libertarian beliefs, but that's unlikely to apply to anyone who didn't already have libertarian leanings. 
In my case, Lsd turned me from a filthy liberal into a full-blown socialist.

Well, I was mostly just joking. I was gonna say taco bell, but I realized nobody ever plans that in advance.
But I disagree that everything is a gamble. A risk, certainly, but not a gamble. What moves something from gambling to a risk is knowledge. Going skydiving would be a gamble, but by packing my own chute and inspecting it for tears, I can mitigate much of the uncertainty and gain a degree of comfort that I would otherwise lack, therefore no longer making it a gamble. 
This is an important distinction because in some cases you can't overcome that burden, and I think Bitcoin at present is one of those. The only way you can protect yourself from risks in the btc market is by avoiding excessive leverage and/or insufficient diversification. Once the regulatory framework around it solidifies and exchanges get their shit together, it will be much much closer to where I'd no longer consider it gambling, but at present everyone who's hodling is engaging in a pure speculation play, and so far its working, but those past results have no bearing on future outcomes. With so little liquidity in the market, it's entirely possible that it could tank even harder than its spiked, and do so while everyone throwing their savings at it sleeps through the night.

The people who sit on the board are political appointees, but their terms last longer than any one term in office and they operate independent of oversight outside of the appointment process.
People act like they're some secretive cabal and not a bunch of nerdy PhDs who genuinely want the economy to do well. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:02:21
Because moving money out of the asset that's occupying a larger share of your portfolio helps protect you from market shocks. Take your speculation gains and convert some of them to less risky investments. That's what you're supposed to do when a high risk move pays off, not double down and keep taking risks.

It helps guard against a shock in the US market, but it leaves you overly exposed in bitcoin. What happens if tomorrow it comes out that the largest exchanges don't have the cash to pay people who divest (it likely won't, but that's not the point) - the value would almost certainly crater. You've made a ton of money on speculation, and the sensible move is to reinvest some of that gain but to put some of it in investments that aren't as volatile. 
Put another way, if you hit a double zero in roulette, is the right move to quit or is it to put all your winnings on 00 again, because you're clearly on a hot streak.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:42:43
What I'd do in your situation is set a threshold that you feel is reasonable (personally, I'd say anything south of 15%. 50% is way too high, regardless), and any time any class of assets creeps above that line, move the excess elsewhere. Index funds are a great way to reduce the risk of your portfolio without giving up much of your earning potential - you'll still hit 5-7% per year every year on them. Real estate (if you're in a good area) is also a strong bet, and can be immediately revenue generating if you don't mind the headache of renting.

Cigarettes  (NOT tobacco, just cigarettes) have a 95% addiction rate, roughly. Heroin is right around 20%. I'm not trying to demonize tobacco, or defend Heroin use. I'm just pointing out that this drug is probably one of the most misunderstood drugs on the planet and too many people focus on the fucking chemical and ignore the fact that it feels really dammed good. 
People are able to quit smoking cold turkey because cigarettes don't sink their claws nearly as deep into your psyche. The physical withdrawals from dope? They last a week, maybe 2 if you've been going hard for the last few months. The psychological addiction? That's probably going to follow you for literally the rest of your life. 
. 
Stop talking up being dopesick like it's the end of the fucking world. You don't need your fix because you don't want to throw up, you need your fix *because you are mentally broken without it*. 
I mean for fucks sake, I smoke tobacco regularly (roughly one blunt per day) . I've got no problems with it. I used it as a conveniently example of something with a high addiction rate that people would be familiar with. If it makes you happy, I can edit my post to remove all mention of tobacco - Heroin addicts at approximately the same rate as Meth (18%) and double caffeine or marijuana (9%). Physical addiction has practically no bearing on the psychological component of being hooked. It might make you continue on a train to disaster, but it is not why you start using and it is not why you develop a habit. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:54:53
Heroin is approximately 1/5 as addictive as cigarettes. In fact most users of Heroin are not habitual users (ie they use it on a once or twice a month basis). 
Kicking Heroin is incredibly difficult, but it has to sink it's hooks into your first. For most people that doesn't happen (with the notable exception of iv users, but that's conflating the issue at hand with something else. IV is rough regardless of the chemical).
