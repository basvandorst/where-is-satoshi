No I mean, you guys have a general consensus here. Every other* coin that isn't bitcoin is a scam*. Where in dogecoin or litecoin they are more open to a debate on at least trading on cryptsy etc.
So, I think you will agree with this point.

It's nice to see at least 1 person on this subreddit has explorered the vast world of alts. I can see how many people would be turned off, many coins are so new, and especially compared to BTC.
But yeah proof of stake is an innovation. LTC is very valuable to me when trading because it really does function as a silver to BTCs gold. There are collector "niche" coins that people go crazy for. Doge obviously out-transacting Bitcoin for a few days.
I just think it is ironic that is all. That a person could embrace bitcoin as an absolute, yet any competition in the exact same emerging market would be labeled as a bad investment.

Right, so this validates all the other alt-coins as well. That are also valuable on cryptmarketcap.com

I don't think you understand. I know a few developers that are working at UNO and they have offices in Holland and New York already.

UNO is in LIMITED supply, don't you understand? Right now you should be on coinex.pw but always leave buy orders in the low side of cryptsy. See the main site, you can calculate the blocks yourself. We are interested in the more technical aspects of crypto currency.

Some coins do not have a scam, and were not premined or have any bounties attached to them.
What do you have to say about these?
What about the fact people said bitcoin is a scam for suckers who are just  gambling their $$$ away. What about that?
What about the promise of Bitcoin being the root of a next-generation forex market?
It's time to wake up and start trading, do your own research, but don't be so naive* yourself.
