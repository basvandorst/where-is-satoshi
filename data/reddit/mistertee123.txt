I used the 12 word recovery phrase which worked for me. Maybe try that?

My low fee tx has been in limbo for nearly 4 weeks.

Yeah, I can kinda see your point. But bitcoin is touted as an alternative to fiat, hell some people even see it taking down the global banking system. This can never happen while these design flaws remain.

I had the same problem with blockchain.info. I installed electrum and imported my keys and the monrh old zombie transfer did not appear. I was able to spend my coins as normal.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:23:07
Yeah, the media frenzy over bitcoin will eventually subside, and things may return to some sort of normality. I'm just surprised that a system that has been in development for 9 years can have these fundamental problems.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:06:41
Why is it that whenever BTC drops people on here automatically blame manipulation? The rise from around $8k to $19k was fuelled by media hysteria which has now subsided. Maybe BTC is now returning to a more 'natural' price. 
No need for you to invoke those bogeymen with their evil futures contracts.

I had a stuck tx from 11th December (blockchain.info wallet). I imported my keys into Electrum wallet and the stuck tx disappeared.

All of these issues with fees are symptoms of the real problem: that bitcoin transactions are not guaranteed to reach their destination and can stay in limbo forever. That's a pretty bit design flaw in a payments system. And to compound the problem, there is no easy way to cancel an unconfirmed transaction. 
It is not just about uninformed people not setting high enough fees. If there is a sudden increase in network load, fees can go through the roof (as happened mid December) and what was a perfectly reasonable fee one moment can be insufficient the next. Transactions with 10 sats/byte were getting mined as recently as December 4th.

Same problem here, but mine was sent 11th December so my money has been in limbo for 3 and a half weeks. How can anyone tout Bitcoin as a currency when it has such glaring problems like this? For the everyday user (and noobs like me) it is a disaster.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:52:51
I'm in the same position. I've been waiting over 4 weeks for it to drop from the network back into my wallet.

@_date: 2018-01-17 16:34:40
The mempool is full because bitcoin is poorly designed
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:35:51
I've been waiting 5 weeks

You may go bust

Did you mean 'meant'?

The value of a payment medium is its purchasing power, yes? So if it goes from being able to buy a Lambo to buying a lamb bhuna, then you definitely did lose something gumba.
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:20:18
Or it's just down to more people selling than buying. Why is downward price movement always attributed to 'manipulation' by whales?

"No sell no lose"
This is a common theme in these parts. It's so naive it's almost endearing.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:48:57
This is a fundamental flaw in bitcoin that still hasn't been fixed in 10 years or so of development. There is no guarantee your transaction will go through although it probably will once the network gets less busy.
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:16:15
Huge media hype + huge increase in btc transactions + a btc network that was not designed to scale (ie. 10 minute blocks) equals a clogged network.
@_date: 2019-01-08 09:35:06
Is there any evidence it was a scam campaign or is it just hearsay?
Look, bitcoin can only process 7 transactions a second. That's a tiny number, and with all the media hype it's no wonder the network got clogged.
Even if it was spam, does it not concern you that the btc network is so easily spammable? If bitcoin is to be adopted these problems (scalability and spammability) need fixing.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:54:30
You won't lose your btc. But I had a transaction stuck in limbo like this for 3 weeks
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:24:36
More sellers than buyers, price goes down. Nothing to do with manipulation, just normal market movement.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:06:16
What makes you think that there's manipulation happening?
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:53:53
"This time it's different!" right up to when it pops.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:39:05
Would it cause you hardship if you lost your entire investment tomorrow? If so you are investing too much
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:44:52
But they will eventually want to sell or spend those bitcoins won't they (or are you planning to hodl til death?). The idea that everyone can profit from btc is nonsense, that money has to come from somewhere.
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:41:18
Note I said dollar profit, not dollar spent.
Every dollar you spend on bitcoin is somebody else cashing out. Their profit comes from the market, ie from other investors.
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:47:03
Every dollar profit that one person makes on BTC, another person has to lose a dollar. Some of the comments on here make it very clear where all those lost dollars are coming from.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:20:53
Back in the hysteria at the end of 2017 I had a transaction stuck for 6 weeks. It's a pain. The devs really need to sort this out.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:40:13
Ok, I'll try.
Is there any future for a payments system that offers no guarantee that your transaction will confirm within a day, a week or ever? BTC transactions can in theory get stuck in the mempool forever.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:53:08
Your guess is just as valid as anyone else's around here
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:21:55
Bottom CONFIRMED! etcetera and so on....
