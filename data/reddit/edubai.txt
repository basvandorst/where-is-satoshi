Hi Everyone,,
it will be really nice if they can reboot mtgox as a new community exchange with a new brand called Gox. People can buy/sell Goxcoins as shareholders to get profits from the exchange revenues. The new exchange will have more currencies in addition to bitcoin such as litecoin and dogecoin. for example
BTC/GOX (shareholders coins in exchange for profits pays every x days)
i hope Mark kerpeles will find a way to make everyone happy !

What is Bankruptcy Protection?
"Bankruptcy protection" is the process by which a debtor is "protected" by a court while they reorganize their finances.
Protected from what? Protected from excessively hasty or harassing creditor actions, such as foreclosures, repossessions, law suits, harassing telephone calls, and the like. A more accurate lay-terminology for filing for "bankruptcy protection" would be filing for "financial reorganization" or "financial restructuring" under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.

In my opinion the big crash will be in April. I will keep this thread updated.

If you are really professional trader, you will know that the bearish down trend was not broken yet. It will come to everyone by surprise. Usually bitcoin rally for weeks and loses everything in 3 ~ 5 days, it went from 20K to less than 6K in few days.
