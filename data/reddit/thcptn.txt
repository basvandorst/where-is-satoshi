I read a story detailing the bust online (who knows how much truth there was in it), but it made it seem like this guy was some power-hungry individual even other agencies didn't really recognize or confide in.  He seemed deluded enough to consider DPR a friend while stealing from him and to consider himself decent agent while giving away secrets and committing crimes.
He 100% seems like the scumbag cop that gives officers doing their jobs a bad name.  I hope they make an example of him.

I've had people argue with me and flat out call me an idiot for saying Bitcoin is not a company/corporation.
Someone should create and infographic to make it easier for simpletons to understand.

What if?  Who knows?

The plot twist killed me.  Is there a way to watch/stream/download UltraViolet movies in your location?  If there is I could sell you what I have and even shop other sellers and stores.

Wow, their stock dropped like a rock.

As an aside that doesn't deserve it's own topic (why I put it here.. it kinda fits).  Don't be pushy, but offer to pay with Bitcoin.  I now have a Bitcoin wallet, .02 (a bit over $8 USD -- I know not much) BTC, and more knowledge because a guy offered to pay me with BTC because his PayPal had been suspended.  That was after over a year of interest in the currency and following this subreddit for many months.  Maybe your BTC purchase will also further someones interest in BTC.
My next question is how can I become a millionaire by farming BTC? (I'm kidding)

I have ~$50 in Bitcoin (accepted it a few times instead of PayPal), but it just seems like such a pain to use.  I can't just make a quick payment like with other more popular services.  I have to go though all sorts of verification.  There was also a delay in receiving payment where I had to make the buyer wait or had to take his word the pending payment would come through.  On top of that there is still a risk to my Bitcoins unless I want to go through even more trouble.  Posts like this just dissuade me further from trying it.  I also don't like the volatility of Bitcoin.
I find it fascinating, but not very useful in my day to day life.  I look forward to a day when Bitcoin is widely accepted, (hopefully) stabilizes, and can be easily used to make and accept payments from a variety of vendors.

I subbed a while back hoping to gain an understanding an interest from BTC.  What I have seen here inspires no faith in BTC and makes me want to reconvert the few BTC I have back to USD or other.  I was fairly optimistic before subscribing to this subreddit.  Over the past two years or so it has ensured that I haven't continued to accept payment in BTC despite originally going out of my way to do so.  This huge divide and the poor way its been handled show extreme warning signs in a currency this young and that already has difficulty maintaining the three functions of a currency.
Let me be clear I do not care if it stays regular or goes XT and don't have the technical knowledge to make a fair judgment.  I can tell you that if you ever want BTC to be more mainstream all this arguing makes the entire currency look childish, volatile, and not worth putting money into.  All I see are sites stealing peoples money with users saying "they should have known better," complaints about stores that don't take BTC, and lately all this Gavin/XT "drama".
Sorry for the rant, but I just wanted to let you all know how things like this make the casual BTC users feel.  Hopefully they all figure something out soon, act like adults when necessary, and start working towards the BTC ideals that inspired me years ago and are on the side of this page.

Casual BTC owner.  What is to prevent something like this from happening in the future?

Tin foil hat topics like this are so confusing and discouraging for those who are interested, but not committed to Bitcoin or only dabble a little.
It's one thing to advise using TOR to protect your identity online, but including that the government wants to control you in the topic is just silly.  Separate your personal views on politics from your advice regarding identity protection if you want the general public to take you seriously.

As someone who has a small amount invested in altcoins (it's all BTC), nothing makes me regret it more than people like you.

That's how I arrived at this place.
