BTC is absolutely not fiat. In fact a recent ?miami court ruling said it was not money because it's traded as a commodity.

tl;dr I'm glad it's that simple - sounds great. Send code.
Segwit was a change in the protocol and implementation that made no real difference to users' expectations of how bitcoin works  - just faster. 
What you're talking about are deep changes to the way the blockchain works so users can have (eg) restrictions on time or complete reversals on transactions - this is seriously different from "mere implementation" improvements.

coinbase support is slothfully slow so you'll have to take a few deep breaths and calm down until you eventually hear from them. 
Aside from virus scan, there's not much else you can do until then. If you got a brand new account with exactly the same email, then they and you really do have an interesting situation on your hands. Round up all the emails and deposit receipts you have from them - you may need proof if it's their problem. If you've been phished, not a lot you can do now except learn how not to get phished.

Awkward to add rules to the protocol and still call it bitcoin - but if you are serious, there's nothing stopping an outraged subset of the community from creating a DAO with those transaction restrictions, and perfectly engineered reversals to the blockchain all built in to your heart's desire - but it won't be bitcoin anymore.
Far better to look after your own bitcoin data if you can. Sure, you can lose it but at least it's your own fool fault. Otherwise you're at the mercy of some yuppy VC CTO suit who is not in the least confused by facts. Sadly, competent security people make much more money cleaning out exchanges than protecting them.

tl;dr Just my lazyness, but easy to edit the source to fix although that doesn't change the mathematics.
I offered the OP an out of the box working proof of concept that someone else created - it currently uses blockchain.info but easy to hack that code if you get bored to use a local copy of the blockchain. 
However, unless you have a python compiler for a working quantum computer, **on average** it will still take eons to find a collision with btc in it whether you use that github code as is or edited to use your local blockchain copy.

Try for yourself. 
Your ip will be banned from blockchain.info queries after a few hundred attempts, and the probability that you will randomly  generate a random wallet key and address full of btc is vanishingly small - but try it since it costs very little effort.

If I understand your question correctly, no, not from the bitcoin blockchain itself.
Most wallet software keeps records locally and any commercial bitcoin **exchange** where you traded might be able to look at all the transactions in some internal database it keeps that are **associated** with your account and thus the email you signed up with - but that's independent of the blockchain where  transactions between wallets have the relay ip address (not yours) but zero email addresses AFAIK. 
Most LE want something identifying the participants of each transaction - but not an email - some invariant and absolutely unique biometric.  
Oh, and blockchain.info is just a free blockchain viewer service - they do have support but I don't think they can do what you want - you can get your own copy easily enough to play with - eg bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:12:34
AFAIK wallet.dat is all you ever need to recover your bitcoin core wallet btc balance fully - transactions for that wallet are recovered from the shared blockchain but you might lose some details stored locally...

Oh. I thought technically a US $ is a unit of "fiat money" so either of the two terms are more or less loosely equivalent in contrast to exchangeable value btc commodities  - eg whackypedia says 


so maybe I should have said fiat money - that's got to be a store of value - heck it used to be exchangeable for gold when I were a lad. 
The answer to the OP's question remains no I think.

Done. Let me know when it arrives.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:43:04
You don't want rules, just "additional features" ? 
Does that mean you think these should somehow only apply to exchanges? Or &gt;10k btc transactions? That's easy - take them off the blockchain onto some DAO and (eg) let them wait a week before moving the transaction "for real" to the blockchain. 
Unfortunately waiting a week will piss everyone off - waiting an hour or two annoys me - but I'm afraid that these will have to apply to **all** transactions if they are to apply to **any** blockchain transactions and therein lies the problem.
We all need to agree on exactly what those features are and what they do in practice, right? You can't wave your hands and get computer code. You have to be so explicit that the "additional feature" can be implemented. 
In other words, you eventually have to express the "additional feature" as rules that can be implemented by computer code somewhere so they end up altering the existing freewheeling bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2016-08-13 06:08:20
The math says that the search space of keys and their unique addresses is so large that all the computing power on the planet won't make much difference to a brute force approach.
You can go at it with that little python script to see if you want, or you can try to find the private key for a given public key - whatever, it's going to take forever with current technology - no matter how many nodes - although for small keys, the NSA can probably help.
Quantum computing might change all that but it's not here yet.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:12:22

I do not think it is a wallet but yes, it is an address in some wallet or other, with lots of little transactions.

Bitcoin transactions definitely cannot be recalled without a hard fork, but can you please explain how coinbase could possibly


since AFAIK the entire possible set of bitcoin address the scammer's wallet uses cannot possibly be predicted without having his wallet key. That (I thought) was one of the key protections for bitcoin but you must know more than me! Even if they can block one wallet (which I doubt), the scammer could simply create a new wallet and coinbase has no idea what bitcoin addresses to block.

you need only one intact file - wallet.dat - make several backups from the old data!
Safest way forward (IMHO) is to install bitcoin core on a separate temporary machine, run it once to download the blockchain (takes time!), shut it down, overwrite the new wallet.dat file it created (you never used it) with the one you backed up and your btc should magically reappear.
You can then blow away the backup copy on your usual machine, install a new copy, and copy the blockchain data from the machine where you recovered your btc or download again, shut it down then put the real wallet.dat back in place - the btc should reappear - blow away the temporary machine's copy so nobody can fuck with it.
Sorry if this sounds complex but it kind of is to do safely.
Good luck.

Bitcoin core requires a fair bit of grunt and a highly reliable harddrive. I run it on a serious workstation - ECC ram and all that - for that reason - a laptop or ordinary desktop is not a great platform IMHO. 
Electrum is much less resource intensive but requires trusting a remote server but OP will need to get that wallet.dat working first even if you want to ditch bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-06-28 06:05:59
Panic not. If you check the wallet id on blockchain.info it's probably fine and will reappear once bitcore core has caught up.
Meanwhile: make sure it's the very latest core version. KEEP a copy of wallet.dat somewhere safe while you're upgrading/fixing.
Suggest you disable the tor proxy while it's fixing itself for much faster upload - don't forget to turn it back on when it's done and restart before moving anything.
@_date: 2016-06-22 01:24:48
quite possibly you ran bitcoin core and partially downloaded the state of the entire blockchain or perhaps fully downloaded from a few years or so ago - what are the time/date stamps on the files? An up to date directory with a complete copy of the entire blockchain is about 80G on my linux box.

You *could* and many do just suck it up and use your IRL identity to purchase bitcoin. Accept that it's tainted but make it plausibly deniable - ie no obvious evidence like clearnet transactions or wallets on your pc by cleaning up as you go. Move it in separate transactions to different addresses in a local wallet (which can be regularly destroy so there's no history on your machine - a new empty one appears) and from there to a tumbler and on to your DNM wallet. In helix light we trust. They will probably one day be traceable, and probably are already for very large transactions but for my 0.2 btc every now and again, probably good enough to fool my local Australian LE. YMMV.

works for me from not the united states...
but an exchange is a dreadful choice of wallet IMHO - KYC/AML and all that. If a wallet is all you need, why not electrum or bitcoincore over tor on tails or your pc? Best thing is you can have several and shuffle stuff around before tumbling, then destroy all traces of it ever existing and create brand new ones whenever you feel the urge leaving little external evidence (other than the trail in the blockchain!) to connect you with your coin once it leaves coinbase.
@_date: 2016-11-18 06:11:03
Ah. So none are places coinbase might flag like dnm hotwallets? AFAIK that's usually why they close accounts - AML and all that.
@_date: 2016-11-14 23:12:36
Ultimately btc is always more or less traceable given sufficient effort and computing I'd guess so you can never guarantee that a route back from the DNM to your coinbase coins is impossible to identify. 
IANAL but assuming you are talking about small amounts and you are not foolish in other ways, plausible deniability is what you need. Shuffle the coin between temporary wallets you control in varying small transactions then tumble to the DNM site. Destroy all evidence of the temporary wallets and the shuffle so LE can find nothing to convince a court on any of your equipment. Your line is that you sent the btc from coinbase to some a wallet owned by someone you met in a pub and then, whatever happened to the coin is nothing to do with you, right?
@_date: 2016-11-14 10:02:29
Common win/linux wallets like electrum and bitcoin core have options to force all traffic through tor and you should absolutely make sure that's what your wallet is doing - it will work fine. Cleartext with your isp ip is not very anonymous...
@_date: 2016-11-15 06:22:27
absolutely - goes without saying in most countries for most situations.
@_date: 2016-11-14 11:01:04
I use helix light FWIW. 
Sadly, since the blockchain is a complete record, it might be a waste of 2.5% but I do it because it currently probably makes it harder for LE to follow the coin I get from coinbase - I move them through a couple of temporary wallets then on through helix to wherever. But that's just me. YMMV!
@_date: 2016-09-28 07:37:59
You can legally buy bitcoins in australia from coinbase I believe with less eye watering fees if you are willing to provide all the required AML and KYC documentation - 100 points and all that sheit. 
So, it depends how untraceable you want the coin to be.
Once that's done and you've purchased bitcoin legally and relatively cheaply, split up through multiple wallets and a good tumble gives you the basis of plausible deniability and low risk of being definitively attached to the coinbase btc AFAIK.

@_date: 2016-09-08 11:13:44
It's a great idea if (eg) you accept incoming btc as (eg) donations and don't care who knows how much was donated - one address can be reused, but it's a terrible idea if you want all your transactions to be as disconnected from each other as possible - which you may well want. Each wallet has a huge number of addresses. You're unlikely to run out.
@_date: 2016-09-20 00:25:23
Yep, that's what I said - sorry if the quote I gave in my response was not sufficiently clear. Let me try again: **no client can do what you want because message texts are not part of the bitcoin blockchain** but (eg) I see a "description" field when I send from electrum - I think that serves as a "message to myself" as I described - but your mileage may vary.
If message texts were allowed on the blockchain, that would open up a serious security risk because it would be trivially easy to launch a huge bloat attack on the blockchain by sending millions of microtransactions with huge message texts.
@_date: 2016-09-06 06:19:01


typo perhaps - did it work without error?
I set it through the gui - not sure what those including the radnomize one do but I think the first one basically does what you need to proxy all traffic through your local tor proxy.
@_date: 2016-09-22 00:02:05
That error report is for an old version and  haven't had that problem but would suggest the usual drill - you using the latest release? It works fine for me FWIW but you may have a borked data file - or a file permission error - I've seen bus errors from trying to overwrite root owned files (but not with bitcoin core)
Got plenty (&gt;90GB on my linux box right now!) of spare drive space for the blockchain? 
Perhaps: Backup your wallet.dat to 3 separate places (if you have any btc); remove all files in the data directory; completely reinstall latest version; sync up the blockchain; shutdown; restore your backed up wallet.dat over the default one....

If you are selling stuff on line, sadly there's really no possible way to know anything about the coin or the purchaser. Assuming the law makes any sense at all, convincing a judge of that will probably get your money released? OTOH they might want to know exactly what it was you were selling - if that's a problem, you may have to cut your losses.Talk to a lawyer for better advice. You could try for free.
@_date: 2016-10-25 23:35:11
Will likely eventually turn out fine if your tx shows in the blockchain as unconfirmed. The delay is in transaction confirmation by miners and most likely made worse by a low transaction fee in your wallet settings. I got caught with low default fees in an old (2.4.1) version of electrum yesterday. Bitcoin core is fine. There's a huge backlog of transactions right now so low and zero fee transactions are at risk of long delays.

Depends on how old I'd guess but eg using bitcoin core on old linux box? I would think that the old wallet.dat should be all you need? Do NOT lose that file - unless you have the original private key your btc are gone AFAIK. Something like: on new ballsy machine, install bitcoin core. run it, let it synchronise completely. Shut it down. 
Copy a copy of wallet.dat from your old machine *over the unused, new bitcoin core wallet.dat* and restart bitcoin core - should have old keys restored and balances. Unless, they changed the format of wallet.dat or something....
Make sure it's using your local tor proxy after it synchronises so the origin of all transactions gets obfuscated.
@_date: 2016-07-16 10:58:01
true - as long as you're using tor for your transactions and not your own ip :) 
but I guess the point is that the blockchain is perfect for forensic deconstruction and it's not paranoia if the fuckers really are out to get you.
@_date: 2016-07-29 03:21:05

Never used breadwallet but any two bitcoin wallets with the same key are exactly the same wallet - you can have 10 copies if you want. You might think you have 10 separate wallets but the math is such that that key determines all addresses for that wallet. That's why (generally) a lost wallet can be completely reconstructed from the key and all bitcoin in that wallet will be recovered - certainly true for bitcoin core and electrum which I do use. Transactions from any one copy of the wallet will change the blockchain and that will be reflected in the other copies once they synchronise. Zero sum game.
@_date: 2016-07-05 01:55:19
Doubt that a delay send gui exists - once you send, the blockchain gets updated and it's gone - that's how it's designed. A cron job to send would be trivial with bitcoin core, or send it to someone trustworthy like me and I'll send it on for you at the right time. :) 
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:46:05
You have the very latest bitcoin core available for your OS? 
It should sync pretty fast. Ultimate limit is overall network speed. 
If you are currently proxying core through the local tor proxy (you usually should!), try turning the tor proxy off until sync is done. 
Tor network traffic slows things down a lot AFAIK but you definitely need to re-enable the proxy before actually doing any transactions. Worked for me.
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:40:47
yep, but the OP transferred into the core wallet apparently before it was fully synched. So now if OP makes a nice new electrum wallet = new key so won't see the core receiving wallet. Not ideal.
See above - there's an alleged solution. Not purty but might work if the OP doesn't want to wait for core.
Electrum works fine but you have to trust the host provider not to fuck you over - advantage of bitcoin core is that you interact directly with the blockchain at the cost of needing a copy. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 10:48:14

Haha. 
Recursion. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:22:19
The two I use, Electrum and bitcoin core, both support multiple wallets but only one at a time. AFAIK creating each new wallet generates a distinct private key and you can only open one wallet at any one time in each application instance - command line option for core, menu choice for electrum. No idea for breadwallet as I said.
I don't think having wallets with the same key open in multiple independent instances of an application would cause much trouble but nor could it do you much good - the key is stored in the wallet but all your coin is on the blockchain so any transaction in any instance will generate changes to the blockchain that prevent eg double dipping on any bitcoin balances by swapping between instances. Otherwise, there'd be chaos with people recycling their btc infinitely!
FWIW: I'm not interested in experimenting with btc close to US$700 and think what the OP is probably trying to do is neither wise nor practicable.
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:10:15
AFAIK for every key (eg as a 12 word phrase) there is a finite but large family of addresses which can only be generated from that key so given a key, it's possible to calculate all associated addresses and check the blockchain for all associated outstanding balances. The important thing is that this is not reversible mathematically so nobody can (yet!!) derive the key, even given all associated addresses. Lose the key and you lose control of all the addresses and thus all your btc
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:44:39
Duh. KYC. Read their T&amp;C. Bitcoin is far easier to track than cash and it could be argued that anyone too stupid and cheap to spend 2.5% tumbling their coinbase coins deserves to have their dildo purchases made public.
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:15:28
Might be better expressed as "for every unique key, a unique set of bitcoin addresses can be generated deterministically. Reversing the calculation to derive the key from addresses is currently not possible" 
Of course, quantum computing may change all that drastically....

Ask dr google about bitcoin taint. 
tl;dr you might want to do more than that. 1 transfer to 1 address is a kind of noop for anyone with appropriate tools I would guess.
