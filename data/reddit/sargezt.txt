It was definitely never meant to be decentralized though. I appreciate a changing of the business model, that shows that they actually realize the utility of it. Bitcoin is great as a value store nowadays, but the only three truly useful coins in my eyes right now are ethereum, ripple, and monero.
Not in terms of value, or future value, but actually useful.
I have fifty percent in Bitcoin, 25 percent in ethereum, 10 percent in ripple, and the other 15 in various altcoins, but that is fifteen percent I fully expect to lose.

Any fast blockchain could replace it, but given the company, I understand their reason for pushing it.
Edit: Perhaps you're asking why a blockchain is necessary, but it's because unless someone controls more than half the power of a good blockchain, it's incorruptible. Good banks want a ledger that can't be modified, and with individual ledgers that's impossible.
Edit 2: if you're asking why Bitcoin can't replace it, unless you folks can figure out transfers in milliseconds, it's not viable for that purpose. I have a lot of lot of money invested in Bitcoin, but no, Bitcoin is a value store at this point.

I'm sorry, I don't quite understand what you're asking. Can you rephrase it?

Ah, I understand. I am definitely not an expert here, but I see two key advantages to the actual currency.
First, no need for fees with transfer between currencies. The vast majority of transfers internationally are just transferred again to some other banks. I think that's shitty, but it makes sense for banks to try to cut down on those forex fees if 99% of a transfer will just go to another bank in another country.
Secondly, the actual ripple protocol doesn't provide a decentralized ledger to my understanding. The currency does.

That is not a police matter, it's a civil matter.

Man, people refuse to just simply explain it. It's a blockchain intended for use by banks to transfer money to other banks. The current system is shit, at least internationally, hence why it is valuable.
I have no idea why everyone refuses to explain that.
Edit: Before people pile on and tell me this, it's not actually used for that yet. However, the company that created it is trying to start using it for that, and a lot of banks are on board with the idea, particularly in Asia.
Edit 2: and it isn't a cryptocurrency, just to be clear. It's centralized, which many people consider a weakness, but banks really need that to jump on board. They can't sue millions of people for stealing a million dollars, but they can sue a company.
