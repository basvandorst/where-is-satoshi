5 cents
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:33:32
Good to hear thank you
@_date: 2017-04-29 01:45:40
What im afraid of
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:24:01
I just hear that coinbase sometimes holds on to your bitcoins as long as they can but maybe because it was some sort of bankng error. I don't have a reason specifically for me, just wanted to get an opinion about coinbase in general.

Bought some on april 29th and still nothing as well
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:10:03
Hardware wallets are probably the safest way imo
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:37:03
thank you brother :)
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:07:38
No it was on my dashboard
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:18:30
Sounds sketchy
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:34:01
Those numbers satisfy me so much
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:02:32
These should be compared side by side the prices of btc
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:02:20
Not sure what that means
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:00:09
I would have bought 2 days before if my paycheck wasn't late
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:34:42
It will go up regardless, but this growth is insane
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:51:27
How did you get that widget?
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:09:35
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:43:01
trusting you guys
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:18:53
Hope you're right m8
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:58:55
Coinbase is pretty much instant, you might want to try those other sites once you get approved though
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:30:37
Wouldn't worry about it, bitcoin traffic is crazy rn. And im sure it takes more than one day
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:11:43
Same, we all got conned man
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:12:56
Well im still gonna buy either way, just hoping it goes down so i can reeeally buy
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:42:47
So wouldn't this be good for miners aswell because they could process more transactions per hour?
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:24:09
Well i got an order trade from an official purse account so i think i should be good
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:31:40
you failed me
@_date: 2017-05-10 06:17:00
thank you for the knowledge brother
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:58:45
Just recently or in general?
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:04:19
Conbase is a joke, use Gemini
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:32:19
what that
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:37:25
Savages. Would you recommend a better platform?
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:32:34
With that kind of logic, any exiting wallet could be unsafe. Bitcoin might as well be a giant scam.
@_date: 2017-05-10 06:41:22
Simply put
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:59:39
This is me, bought at 2700, im now kicking myself
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:48:01
supposedly all the bitcoins i ordered are suppose to come today, ill give it a couple more days until i lose my sanity.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:37:10
Panic sell at $10k /s
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:30:18
Insane, can we expect a drop soon?
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:31:15
I tried buying a trezor from purse.io but it was refunded twice
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:58:04
Consider gemini
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:40:18
Prerty sure it isn't a problem. If having cash isn't illegal than bitcoins shouldn't be a problem
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:49:10
Bro my bitcoins from may 4th came in, but still waiting on the bitcoins from april 28th
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:51:58
A couple questions
Can you receive bitcoins onto the hardware even if your not using it at the time? For example i go to a bitcoin atm and buy bitcoins and send it to the receiving address of the hardware, will i get the bitcoins later after connecting it to my computer?
Also i want to buy one of these with bitcoins, whats the best way of going about that
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:48:20
I should probably trasfer my bitcoins to a wallet as soon as i can then huh?
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:57:10
Gemini, but they require info as well
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:37:13
So this segwitt process is just a change of fees?
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:40:54
Been waiting for about 11 days here, on 2 different deposits
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:02:06
Bitcoins are extremely dividable
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:54:12
Legit, but shitty service. I would recommend staying away from it if you can.
