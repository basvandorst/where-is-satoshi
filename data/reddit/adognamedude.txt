 Wences and I are discussing the rise of blockchain and other emerging trends in technology. I’m also excited to share a big milestone for the PayPal community.

I think the worst part of our public discourse is to perpetuate a myth about American democracy existing at any time in the past or present. Democracy is not about getting one vote every 4 years for a two political leaders both chosen by big Banks and corporations nor does it help to assume that we have a free market in the past or in the present when in fact the whole time it has been corporate monopolies﻿

Wozniak also expanded on the broader uses of blockchain technology as he put forth cases for use of the technology across fields ranging from financial services to mining.

And this is excluding any transactions that have descendants, so no sub-transactions 'overpaying' fees.

I find all the problems explained on the topic of fraud proofs are bogus: the whole assumption about all of them is that a majority of hashrate conspires to create a bad block.
But this assumption is what invalidates the working of Bitcoin as first thing, so it's not useful to talk about other problems: with 50%+1 of the hash rate behaving maliciously bitcoin is dead anyway.﻿

Additionally, Bank of American was a major player in the 2008 stock market crash because of their predatory mortgages.  Trump is trying to roll back regulations put in place to keep it from happening again. I avoid  BofA and their ilk like the plague.

I love this bit, but I got good news for Big-Feet. They still needed chippers in the bronze age because bronze is made out of 2 rare metals that have to be traded from far away for most people in the bronze age. Thus bronze was a high class item, your every day man would still use stone items, ensuring some employment for chippers until the iron age.﻿

I don't know about you but if it were me... moving such amount of money in 1 transaction :0... and making a mistake of one letter for example... it would be a bad bad day :)

Some services are already running and offer channel openings with them.
If a lightning node only connects to that service, it would be one of those end branches.
If a lot of nodes only connect to that one service, it'll look like what you're pointing at.

Given that this is just a third of five waves up, the implications are that bitcoin has potential to run further over time.﻿

I believe this is definitely the way that Bitcoin can reach higher. The alt coins that directly compete with the solutions that MS are going to provide on Bitcoin will probably go the way of Bitconnect.

This transaction brought back the same exact feelings that I had with my first ever Bitcoin transaction. I just sat there in complete awe for a few minutes.

They need [blockchain technology]. … Stone Age has not ended due to lack of stones, but because new technologies appeared. Those late in this race will instantly, VERY FAST, be under full dependence from leaders of these processes,” wrote bitcoin investor and expert Trace Mayer, translating the words of Putin.
