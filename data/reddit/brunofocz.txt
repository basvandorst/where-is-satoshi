actually Gdax (and the other exchanges) act as a de facto 2nd layer on the blockchain:  
uses internal database for transacting currencies , and periodically does a commit of  [batch transitions](  (each transition has many receivers (10+)) on the blockchain, to minimize the fees; so no free fee transactions are put in the mempool

we are discussing about increasing the block size;  the original Nakamoto model was defined for a commodity,and  the excessive  increase of the block size goes against his model,
 leading to some problems, like [DDOS attack]( or [51% attack](
if Bitcoin value goes 10x, it is not easy to scale  the block size to 10x, because of  the original design;
the only feasible way on my opinion is use of    layers like  lighting network, or just consider it as a commodity

Quoting the [original Satoshi Nakamoto words](


He stated from the beginning that it is not a media for everyday spending, and more similar to gold, so it's just people misleading the meaning;
Using a overlying cryptographic layer, like the lightining network, could enable it for micro-payments

I try to explain better my point of view:
 bitcoin is a limited resource, market is expanding -&gt;price grows high, and transaction fees grow high during time -&gt; ok, Nakamoto admits that "it's more typical of a precious metal" behaviour (so it's good, it's not a design fault but an expected behavioiur);
 the OP asks to expand the block size, is it possible? We should need a 10x expasion,to have low fees and use it as a currency for small transactions; it could be difficult to obtain it  mantaining the integrity of the bitcoin model; so maybe the correct definition could be a hybrid of currency and commodity
(btw I read that document in 2013 :) )

you should motivate your assertion

 the tipping bot (or anyone wants to receive credit) must join the LN network  opening a channel with a hub;
 the balance is on the channel state and not on the tipping bot  address, so the tipping bot once signed to the LN network can go offline (the channel is held by the hub, that also shows the balance on request); 
the address of the receiver is visible through the LN network because the channel is held open by the hub;
the tipping bot comes back online only to redeem the credit (that means signing the current  transaction held by the hub and closing the channel)

your 00.1 btc is inside a big transaction , something like [this]( it costs 0.032btc but it has many receivers;
joining many payments in a single transaction reduces significantly  the [blockspace usage](
