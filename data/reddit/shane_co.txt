Yeah I could, but what’s the fun in that? I’m just seeing if there’s an easy option to buy straight with bitcoin first because why not. If not that’s what I’ll do

I thought you could only get games and shit like that from the Microsoft store. Can you get an actual Xbox?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:13:26
Because I would rather spend the gains I’ve made off of my coins than the money in my checking account

Thank you. Currently making this happen

How do bitcoin ATMs work? Can someone explain this to me? Do you just put money in it and it gives you a paper wallet or what? Is it updated with current prices?

Never seen this one before...

How do i move them to another exchange easily?
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:59:09
If I have money in gemini, will I still have both after the form or still just bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:35:58
Just rip the paper in half physically and you’ll be chillin
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:56:43
Anybody else got any advice for me?
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:56:32
Thanks for the insight!

What’s the difference between leaving them in gemini and downloading them to a wallet? Won’t I still have the same amount of BTC either way? Or will I somehow lose BTC in gemini or will it become less valued? I guess I’m just confused on how it would be affected

Can you provide me with a simple dumbed down version of how I go about this. I can research more into it, but could you give me a starting direction 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:30:12
So if I have BTC in Gemini you’re saying I need to protect it offline before November 25th?
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:08:03
So you’re saying we’re gonna see a FAT decline?
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:03:37
I’m talking Limit, AO Limit, MOC, IOC, Market, or AO Market?

Best wallet to use? - go
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:33:50

@_date: 2017-10-29 21:05:00

@_date: 2017-10-11 21:25:53
