"Better" is a subjective term and depends on what you plan to use cryptocurrencies for.
Bitcoin has been around a long time and is widely known - relatively speaking.  It's got a large market cap and is looked at seriously by investors, businesses and governments.  It's a major initiative to get the global economy into digital, de-centralized currencies.  If there is a cryptocurrency that you will be able to spend like cash at most retailers (one day) it will likely be bitcoin.
Dogecoin is a light-hearted, fun cryptocurrency that is good for new users.  You can learn the basics of use and security in a stress-free environment.  It is a new cryptocurrency, however, and may not be around forever.  It will likely be used mostly for sending micro-payments - "tips" - to people over the internet.  It will likely also be used for public initiatives and crowdfunding.  
Which is "better" depends on what you plan to use it for.  However, most people would probably argue that Bitcoin has the most realistic chance of being a cash substitute - which is probably what makes it the better choice in most people's minds.

No idea... I can just say what happened to me.

Actually, I just got an email from them moments ago saying I was whitelisted.  Still no word on whether or not I get my purchase from back when it was $295/BTC...

I just withdrew 0.01xxxx BTC from BTC-e to CampBX.  I got the email instantly and it appeared as "pending" in CampBX within a few minutes.
So I took the rest out (0.39xxx BTC - woo! lol) using a fresh address from CampBX.  Again, I got the email instantly and CampBX says it's "pending" as well.
I will update if something goes wrong.
**EDIT:** They all got there, safe and sound.

CampBX accepts Money Orders and Personal Checks.  They are working on ACH transfers though.

Every site dealing in Bitcoin can be claimed as a "scam" at one point or another.  I'm not disagreeing with you, but just saying...
Coinbase "scammed" me.  Withdrawal on the 7th, on the 13th was flagged as fraud.  Didn't answer four tickets over the next week, finally said they would "escalate" my ticket last week and nothing from them since.
Now I use CampBX for money processing.  Money order to them took a couple days to get there then a couple more to process.  Transfer the bitcoins to other exchanges to play with then back to CampBX to cash out.  Sadly there isn't enough volume to play the market on CampBX.
Although nowadays you'll see everyone yelling "scam" about CampBX not *really* being at the address on their website - but rather at an apartment nearby.  (My guess would be they got their LLC - *"Bulbul Investments"* - using their apartment address and have CampBX as a DBA ("Doing Business As") located in those offices.)  Maybe someone in GA should go knock on that door and see! :)
I'm sure there are sketchy reports from all of the sites.  It seems like you take a risk everywhere unless you buy in person -- although people get robbed doing that, apparently.
Maybe we should all just fly to the ATM in Canada!

So I've heard.  I've also heard terrible things about every service so I take it with a grain of salt.  For me they've been fine... so far... (but thanks for the heads up!)
Regardless, the only reason I posted that was because clearly you *can* operate an exchange out of the US.  
Oh!  I forgot about Kraken which is based out of San Francisco...
So there's two.

Yes - 4 *business* days that is.  Ended up being 6 days total for me.
The price per BTC doubled in that time so I think they "flagged" it so they wouldn't have to sell a more expensive bitcoin for the lower price they agreed to.  
The worst part was they lead me along those 6 days and only flagged it at the exact time they said it would be deposited.  I wasted almost a week watching the price rise for them to just say "nevermind" at the last second.

What about CampBX which is based in Georgia?
EDIT: **How is that comment getting so many upvotes!?**  You clearly can operate an exchange in the US.  CampBX and Kraken are both US based and Coinbase, who is also in the US, would have most of the same hurdles to clear as an "exchange".  They just only exchange USD and BTC.

I'm just waiting on Coinbase to honor my purchase of 0.1 BTC from 13 days ago...
Four emails have gone unanswered as of today.
