sure.. i could do that.. but then again, i could just store my non-brain wallet instead... the main advantage of the brainwallet comes from being able to recover the wallet without needing to safekeep any external bits and pieces.

you mean a cellphone to photograph your id/bill? i'm sure you could borrow one for a few seconds ;) imo it's well worth it for the convenience of bill payment and ach transfers.

so, are there any sites using this new plugin yet?

one potential problem could be that when brainwallet.org goes away you also need to remember whatever algorithm they use to expand your passphrase into a private key. this may become more of an issue when there are many different 'brainwallet' services all using different algorithms and you can't remember which one you used.
another thing that worries me is that people are probably going to use really bad passphrases..

I think a better way to do this would be to get some kindof voucher payment thing installed on all the existing ATMs -- the way you can already top up your mobile phones. If you could fund bitinstant (or whatever) straight from an ATM that would be great.

I'm not aware of any standard regarding brainwallet encoding.. I imagine they're mostly incompatible, although perhaps some have decided to use the same methods.
Here's one;  which uses sha256(passphrase) - it seems incompatible with whatever encoding the brainwallet.org one uses.
