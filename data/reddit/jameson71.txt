That would still be shitty journalism.

Luckily, if you held the appreciated coin over a year long term capital gains (the increase in value you saw) are taxed at a flat 20% rate, rather than at your (usually higher) income tax rate.  Yay tax breaks for the rich!?

As a uBlock user, you may want to consider uMatrix as a noScript replacement.

I feel like the bitcoin market is filled with rubes who know enough to not try their luck in the stock market, but think their computer knowledge gives them an advantage here.

This ridiculousness can't help but impede the acceptance of bitcoin.  It is hard enough already to buy bitcoins with USD.  Every other month it seems there is a huge scandal and people need to find a new place to go.

I had a similar horrible experience with mt. gox.  I opened an account, bought about $100 worth of bitcoins.  Next time I logged in I was told my account is "under review" and I needed to send them my ID and proof of residence too.
I cannot understand why they allowed me to put the money in and will not let me take it out.  They basically scammed me.

Isn't this type of FUD expected with a currency not backed by the Government?

Question - why is it harder for Americans to buy bitcoins?

If bitcoins look like a good investment at $8 they must have looked even better at $5!

Are you sure the best time to buy something is when it's at it's highest price in the last 10 months?

As someone who doesn't follow bitcoin that closely, it seems like there have been a ton of "exchanges" that have announced "Whoops, we lost all $300K worth of bitcoins our depositors had.  Sorry about that!"

20% fee?  What is this the payday loans of BitCoin?

Go for it.  I'm not sending an identity fraud kit to some yahoo in Japan.

Anything with such a large barrier to entry is going to be a natural monopoly though without regulation.  Just look at all the [airline mergers]( [telecom mergers]( and [media mergers](   Regulators haven't even paid lip service to preventing this.
Kind of off topic and I almost hate to bring it up, but I truly believe that the anti-net-neutrality policies are an attempt to make the "new media" internet follow suit by allowing those with the right contacts and capital to muscle out those without.

But really, how does bitcoin not fall under "interstate commerce" which is the backdoor congress uses to control anything it wants these days, since almost nothing is manufactured and sold only within one state.

This meme sounds just like "[The Internet Perceives Censorship as Damage and Routes Around It](
