I love paying 20 dollars to buy coffee.

Good luck my friend! If I may ask, how are you going to store your coin? If not a hardware wallet, I suggest paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:31:07
Bitcoin volatility is gone, so maybe.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:55:14
Could you give us the public key? My friend got his bitcoin stolen physically, and I tracked the address his bitcoin was sent to. It ended up being an address to a coinbase account.

What an awful meme.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:26:02
Honestly, you probably are fine, but I bought a hardware wallet to sleep at night.

I had a hard drive with 100 bitcoin that I lost. Shit happens.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:26:44
I used bitaddress before getting a hardware wallet. Worked fine for me
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:17:51
Nothing, because of the fees

I use a trezor. At the time it was cheaper than a ledger, and would have got ledger if it was cheaper. I used Amazon, and used trezors link to the Amazon seller.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:50:00
We need lightning faster. The fees are downright unacceptable.

Looks like they may have tumbled them. You might be out of luck.

Litecoin is a much better crypto.

20$ for a transaction is A+?

If create properly, it is much safer than hardware. But thats not easy to do.

You can use an app like breadwallet to import.

30$ is not a good steak.

Let's say the guy gets caught. He would be charged with hacking the website, but would he actually get in trouble for the stolen bitcoin?

The pizza argument is false for one reason: say you bought pizza with fiat, that fiat you spent could have been used to purchase bitcoin, so it doesn't matter if spend with fiat or bitcoin.

Thanks for the comment. I’m all for constructive criticism, but this subreddit isn't. Be ready to get downvoted and or banned.

I'm sorry this happened, hope you get you coins back.

People are using it all the time in the darknet. That's a reason it's this high of a price.

It's never good to have bitcoin on an exchange, since it's technically not your bitcoin since you don't own the keys. Also, the exchange might not give you your free bitcoin gold coming on. Paper wallets are free to make and secure. Make sure you are disconnected from the internet when you do it. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:24:45
The fork gives you bitcoin gold. A lot of people dump it immediately for easy money and reinvest in the lowered bitcoin price.

There's a lot of explaining to do about the fork, but you just need to know that people want to change the bitcoin blocks to make it easier to mine and make profit. When the fork happens anybody with bitcoin who control the keys get free bitcoin gold. This is coming up on the 25th. As long as you have yours keys in a wallet you get free bitcoin gold. Its just a shitty altcoin that will slowly die. NEVER give your private keys to people saying they that you can redeem your bitcoin gold.

Use Gemini/GDAX. Kraken had many problems for me. Also, consider storing your coins on a Trezor or a paper wallet. HODLing is best for beginners.

Make a GDAX account. The fees are way lower than coinbase.
