Amen to that. As long as the sell/buy margin is high enough 
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:02:23
Never sell bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:30:58
what did ?

Tether == exit scam
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:45:17
All roads lead to rome, um... bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-14 19:21:40
Not really lol
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:31:40
the day we will say "no such thing is bitfinex" ....
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:26:38
Aren't they end to end as well?
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:33:56
Lightning ? No thanks! 
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:12:44
But they doesnt accept bitcoin :/
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:30:42
and they keep their own money instead of getting ripped off by the manager
@_date: 2018-10-14 13:57:07
Which alternatives ?
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:29:46
Assuming the house gets the tip and then share it with the waittess (minus %) it's more fair to pay directly in bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-08-10 07:02:42
Why wouldn’t bitcoin hash be computable on an old IBM mainframe ? It’s a Turing machine, anything computable on a Turing machine model could be computable on any “physical machine”, giving enough memory. It’s just that the IPC is so damn slow.
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:30:52
that is indeed an important question. one shall let someone in and out using crypto securely and anonymized.
@_date: 2019-02-10 19:59:05
Did the beer get hot while waiting for 6 conf? Lol
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:50:53
Poor ueshiba, used for BTC meme instead of spreading love and aikido 
@_date: 2019-02-12 11:42:32
Not really. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 09:56:01
The incentive to secure the network for 5$ fee after all (nearly all) bitcoins have been mined sound like something miners won’t do. But then again if bitcoin will be 1,000,000,000$ than sure they will do it.
@_date: 2019-02-01 21:15:07
Use brave browser 
@_date: 2019-02-07 14:31:49
It surely is !
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:33:47
It’s just a niche. Nothing more. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 11:43:25
Almost 20 years. ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-02-12 11:40:52
Don’t expect much from Chinese people .. surely when it’s come to coding. I’m impressed they even know what a while loop is. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:29:19
just like 1broker, it will fall.
@_date: 2019-01-04 05:40:14
I don’t live in a country that Coinbase supports ...
@_date: 2019-01-05 21:49:19
You have to provide picture + Id copies to someone who works at the atm store (bitcoin store). There are no standalone atms in Israel. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 13:48:22
I got btc dust on binancd lol
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:57:05
better use bitcoin cash then?
@_date: 2019-01-15 07:29:21
One problem. There no way to buy bitcoin anymore ;( banks and cc companies blocks all transactions to bitcoin related sites. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 23:54:37
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:44:24
Aha... very nice indeed !
@_date: 2019-01-29 23:51:05
Sure. Although I port forwarded 8333/9735 and raspiblitz shows yellow (instead of green) .. so I hope it works at your place. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:13:09
@_date: 2019-01-15 11:47:10
Local bitcoins is shady business. No local bitcoin community here though. Will check bisq but I doubt it will help ;(
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:31:53
Lol I don’t even use Coinbase 
@_date: 2019-01-17 11:19:25
1broker was a nice alternative. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:22:56
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:41:59
Even if u had 1700 BTC you can’t w en trade that to FIAT
@_date: 2019-01-15 11:39:18
yeah, where? who??
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:07:16
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:49:09
Anyone ?
@_date: 2019-01-15 07:31:05
Not not just send your kid to Germany at the age of 18-20 to get free education instead ? Why pay for us universities ... 
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:36:14
Could you write some instructions on how you did it ?
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:12:44
@_date: 2019-01-29 10:30:25
Keep strong. Holdl. Maybe one day you could tip us. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 07:13:43
When iOS support ?
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:38:39
Sup with this coins ? 
@_date: 2019-01-15 09:56:23
So basically it's a complete course (how many hours it is) on creating a simple linked list .....
it takes literally 5mins to understand and implement linked list in any language, c, c++, java...etc.
so you want to call it a blockchain ah? fine, so instead of backward pointer we will just calculate an sha256 hash.. ok, now it's a blockchain!
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:44:31
I already setup my raspiblitz, it's live and kicking and working well. I just unable to connect to it via a local network.  
Did you mean that for your node, you enabled TOR from the services menu and ... then what?
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:06:50
Don’t use any...
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:43:18
On lan you mean local router ? Ie: 10.0.10:1009? Did you need to do port forwarding or something ?
@_date: 2019-01-25 20:21:27
Still requires crypto to buy crypto. How about usd/visa?
@_date: 2019-01-19 10:12:09
How did you manage to connect to 10009 on the raspiblitz ? I can’t connect from zap or Shango. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:56:59
What a shit hole. (Literally) 
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:28:15
@_date: 2019-01-17 11:18:45
Currently all LN hw (raspberry pi) and other wallets have poor adoptions and shitty cases. We need better developers 
@_date: 2019-01-05 18:27:11
Don’t be fooled. Buying bitcoin in Israel means you have to give ids to the government. Those ATMs there provides 0 privacy.  
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:28:34
LOL 
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:11:14
Waste of BTC :(
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:11:03
Should be distributed among the poor
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:57:59
Also. Bitcoin is far from being economical anyway no matter the solutions.
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:18:12
Like. Why we care? Legacy works fine ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:51:26
Well not all of them had the luxury of life as others.its always important to be compassionate towards one another.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:58:04
I'll buy when its 1$
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:23:20
Great. And save some on your phone for quick purchases 
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:46:43
That’s true. Something I guess they should fix.
