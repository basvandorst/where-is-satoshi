Mike is an insult of arrogance and pride
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:58:22
china is staying on bitcoin core 
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:46:48
litecoins do that, give it a go (and don't come back)
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:52:11
Bitcoin is the solution to double spending 
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:00:26
should Gavin abandon core?
@_date: 2015-06-18 08:14:02
in his head yes....
... the king is naked tough and some kid will call him out
@_date: 2015-06-04 13:08:44
exactly, like dogecoin or next
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:53:52
aka coinbase
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:21:42
used? still is
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:16:20
a bit of a conspiratard I see
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:17:04
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:59:01
the waky Brazilian computer science professor butter who thinks Bitcoin shouldn't have a cap of 21M, who thinks Bitcoin transactions should be reversible, that doesn't understand the difference between anonymous and pseudo anonymous and that wastes his days being envious of blockstream?
hello stolfi, how does it feel?
@_date: 2015-06-18 07:59:07
with checkpoints....
....there is no bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:30:55
plenty of services not providing audits or proof of reserve
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:29:34
they self mine, don't sell chips
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:36:45
now we quote a buttcoiner? 
just go to your altcoin and make your own subreddit
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:50:03
is not working!
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:43:14
correct solution 
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:38:30
he knows people won't agree with him
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:00:44
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:56:37
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:06:15
more pressure to make things more anonymous is good
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:55:15
what a load of BS.
security can't depend on 1 miner running some code
@_date: 2015-06-18 08:01:21
Gavin doesn't have a problem with Mike......
......they are aligned
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:53:17
Mike stop using socks
@_date: 2015-06-18 07:56:14
is not just Mike the irrational one......Gavin too
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:47:46
this is happening with our without Peter, you can't stop miner greed, it's how it works
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:23:21
the block is not increased not because LN is available but because it would break Bitcoin and make it fundamentally centralized
you said many times you can't wait for Bitcoin to implode, why shouldn't we believe you are just a big troll butter
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:04:15
jokes on you, I reported you to bitjesus
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:30:37
Peter is not keen on sidechain security, this does not compute
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:41:38
I was worrying but if they are professionals it's all giggles
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:52:38
I hope he means Jeff's proposal
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:51:53
Mike, for goodness sake, go on holiday, give us a brake. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:56:08
you want to centralize Bitcoin, no way, screw you
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:02:11
enough to be dangerous
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:25:11
the only way to undermine Bitcoin is to try to make zero conf work
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:25:50
some like BTCisGod will never get it
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:29:35
why do you think it is a problem? 
with smart free this is a non problem
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:47:14
only clueless would think that
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:55:13




@_date: 2015-06-18 19:57:43
you are annoying, you propose bullshit that makes no sense without any implementation suggestion, just day dreaming, like, how the fuck are we going to pay nodes, seriously, wtf
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:15:35
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:55:54
now we need a smart contact enabled robot with scissors and webcam. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:36:40
it's neutral to all contentious hard fork from all sources
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:55:25
Tired of your cheating
@_date: 2015-06-18 08:05:47
forking software OK, forking blockchain NOT OK
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:35:19
lol if you had majority you wouldn't need bitcoin.org but gavincoin.org
@_date: 2015-06-18 08:16:39
so Gavin should give up his twitter handle since the only reason he has followers is the publicity he took from bitcoin which he is now trying to move away from (BitcoinXT)
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:39:15
the network has no idea which is first or second, other than the order they receive them, very unreliable
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:55:13
not for hub&amp;spoke and Lightening, no trust required
@_date: 2015-06-18 08:21:43
the title seems to be a quote from the paper itself
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:49:28
oh my god, Mike was being Mike since the beginning! how many people lost money because of his limited knowledge!
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:36:03
is there a patch for people that don't understand the way Bitcoin works?
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:28:32
goddammit you are everywhere bashing about block size please give us a break 
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:47:40
certainly it isn't 50% everywhere worldwide
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:57:16
no consensus required

oh why did you bother you poor little bugger
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:59:18
don't bother with him
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:20:12
orphans don't count in the difficulty therefore they reduce the security of the network

@_date: 2015-07-21 08:35:41
how can I sign with a 3 of 5 multisignature? I can't! bollocks
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:20:49
there is no head developer, the last one to be was satoshi. there is a lead maintainer which is not a role that has the power to change the block size or anything related to consensus.
how many years does one have to be a core dev before you are not new?
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:31:40
maintainer of core, a role that is analogous to a janitor (for code)
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:36:56
I witnessed your dedication
@_date: 2015-07-11 10:57:35
seems very scammy from a first glance
@_date: 2015-07-11 11:06:42
suggesting blockchain info at this point is like suggesting to use mtgox ! DON'T!
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:34:17
are you going to count non voters as 1MB or why are you not telling people to vote on 1MB?

@_date: 2015-07-11 10:54:38
lol @ housekeeping. you wouldn't recognize a keyboard from a banana
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:13:36
did you miss the fact that 1mb is already too much?
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:25:39
what about sipa? or Greg? you are confused. what do you teach at university?
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:28:12
I mean 1 is too much right now, later things will change I agree
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:17:15
my butt was hacked and since then I used a hardware butt protection, no biggy
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:09:35
xt but not core
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:31:21
depends on how much I'm moving. I think 5 dollars for moving $ 100k would be OK
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:55:24
I disagree, Gavin has never been the head of Bitcoin core dev
@_date: 2015-07-01 09:01:33
just because you don't understand that pressure is important and there should always be pressure
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:19:06
nodes are security too
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:07:34
bitgo code paid 84BTC in fee once. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 10:56:34
@_date: 2015-07-11 13:44:25
Roger Ver said the same thing about Mt.Gox
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:17:38
Litecoin has bigger and more frequent blocks, why are people not moving to it?
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:59:46
satoshi then consensus
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:32:28
Erik alt scammer
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:29:42
yeah, some are cute but Gavin's hair cut should be banned
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:11:03
majority of core devs or cute devs?
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:09:37
good riddance
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:22:21
history of hacks, bitcoin.org reviews and code reviews or bugs on github?
@_date: 2015-09-21 08:34:13
neither is iOS, much better to use a separate device with no radio but to each its own
@_date: 2015-09-12 19:10:01
@_date: 2015-09-12 19:10:56
that was a very interesting presentation
@_date: 2015-09-18 21:41:33
if anything the size debate has wasted a lot of time and good will. too many people understanding very little and entering the debate with what basically amounts to no clue
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:56:29
it's interesting you fail so much
@_date: 2015-09-12 18:57:53
only if you assume honest miners that never ever do selfish miner attacks otherwise it exacerbates the problems to not have a limit
@_date: 2015-09-12 18:42:50
he is a master troll
@_date: 2015-09-20 13:46:44
this is why I don't use Bread Wallet I'm too scared of the short cuts you are willing to take with Bitcoin security
@_date: 2015-09-23 08:58:01
kyc is the only argument but doesn't really hold weight everywhere
@_date: 2015-09-29 05:43:21
stupid money doesn't know the consequences
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:46:36
it's always good to find out where some corporation is standing, makes it easier to vote with your ~~dollars~~ bitcoins
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:29:54
can I invest
@_date: 2015-09-12 19:08:20
his assumptions are weak as hell
@_date: 2015-09-20 13:31:40
if more users use Bitcoin of course I'm more likely to transact with them
maybe not all of them but more of them for sure
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:41:02
did you apply for patents?
@_date: 2015-09-16 22:52:30
do you support bip70?
@_date: 2015-09-21 08:50:17
unusually low ratio of scammers for a Bitcoin event? ;D
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:21:31
does it still? saw some issues with it today
@_date: 2015-09-21 06:33:39
isn't mytrezor.com a webwallet?
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:28:40

@_date: 2015-11-18 21:14:07
the 21 mining chip is almost a scam

you can't argue with logic
@_date: 2015-11-07 09:10:52
looks like XT is on Bitcoin.com wallet section, didn't see you complain there!
@_date: 2015-11-13 07:07:38
maybe "legitimacy" of source?
@_date: 2015-11-13 07:33:12
and for that we need a breakthrough
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:04:03
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:27:19
sounds like your fault for losing Google Authenticator
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:30:44
can you explain what do you mean?
@_date: 2015-11-16 11:18:08
great news everyone
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:54:12
good sleek work Luke!
@_date: 2015-10-10 07:22:46
what did you expect the owner of an altcoin exchange to say?
@_date: 2015-11-09 07:07:58
bitcoin is not a democracy, it's consensus
@_date: 2015-11-06 20:19:59
just 75% of miners not of nodes and economic majority
@_date: 2015-11-12 07:55:00
Coinbase and payment channels are also bad for miners? what about PayPal and visa? swift?
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:53:00
isn't lighthouse already dead?
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:50:02
la crème de la crème
@_date: 2015-11-05 07:27:09
but nobody uses the alts and converting coins will cost you more in fees
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:02:45
no proof?
@_date: 2015-11-15 08:20:54
I seriously doubt it ever worked
@_date: 2015-11-06 20:43:02
we get it you want big centralizing blocks, stop spamming this sub
@_date: 2015-11-15 08:36:58
don't walk away, run away.
barely better than BC.I : patents on multisignature procedures, 85 Btc mistake fee bugs, employees (statoshi) pushing for contentious hard forking changes and even a moderator of XT subreddit and worse part of all they are part of evil blockchain alliance
@_date: 2015-11-01 09:23:27
confidential transactions (CT) and coinjoin
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:17:12
I think who ever is behind 21 direction is clueless about Bitcoin, or worse, knows just enough to be dangerously stupid
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:42:29
it appears to be a long rant interleaved with lies
@_date: 2015-11-10 07:19:14
Theymos has the keys too and guess who gave them to him? Satoshi!
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:01:11
there would be more orphans and more empty blocks without the relay network
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:26:10
@_date: 2015-10-22 07:09:22
is that closed source?
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:20:27
tired of your spamming Roger
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:01:11
I'd say he's barely making the top 20 of Bitcoin experts
@_date: 2015-10-26 07:25:29
is command line front end ok? try bitcoind-ncurses maybe
@_date: 2015-11-07 09:07:15
he is not moderating bip 101 talks. he is moderating talks about an insecure implementation .
@_date: 2015-10-26 13:46:32
stop the spam man
@_date: 2015-11-02 14:18:57
it's true, he did very little in the last two years
@_date: 2015-11-01 09:34:50
n of m attack as opposed to what? your exchange disappearing with the funds? how's liquid worse than the current status quo?
@_date: 2015-10-30 06:54:20
is it open source yet? otherwise we should wait before promoting
@_date: 2015-11-16 08:39:56
quite a lie, lighting didn't exist when they were funded
@_date: 2015-11-07 09:17:12
I also prefer circle to Coinbase but don't leave money in either, use one of the wallets from Bitcoin.org excluding the "bank" options like circle, xapo, Coinbase, etc
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:01:42
at least he had the balls to publish his crap slides, Peter R hasn't published his has he?
@_date: 2015-10-26 14:51:20
lol the bug was found by a buttcoiner !! a bitgo dev (Ryan) couldn't even find the bug!!?
your multisignature patent pending company is not nice!  go back to your subreddit with the fat blocks kids
@_date: 2015-10-21 19:41:39
are you also updating your rbf branch to 0.11.1?
@_date: 2015-11-12 08:00:52
armory may still have some problems with 0.11.1 malleability fix thing
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:00:15
I hate that it is not backwards compatible, makes me scared.
can I convert it to private keys and sweep?
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:47:01
yeah! reminds me of Ryan X Charles! is people like them and you that are key for the future of Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-26 17:54:20
as if that needed a patent or as if that's creative work , WTF man
@_date: 2015-10-26 07:23:53
mycelium uses its own servers (flaky sometimes) and the license is not free software/open source but some weird Microsoft licence.
Bitcoin Android wallet is better.
@_date: 2015-11-17 22:40:06
seriously? neither. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:31:21
has he done anything for Bitcoin as of today?
@_date: 2015-10-26 07:19:45
HW.1 or Nano
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:03:52
he didn't deserve the free travel/ticket they are being too nice
@_date: 2015-10-26 17:49:49
what was holding back Jeff Garzik?
@_date: 2015-11-12 07:49:50
who's the leader of the internet?
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:58:55
some arrogant dude clueless and outright scam
@_date: 2015-11-12 07:47:51
the only thing different from an rpi is the miner and the proprietary api. the miner can be swapped with $30 worth of Bitcoin since the miner won't ever make that amount and the proprietary api can be replicated
@_date: 2015-10-14 07:34:54
I heard that the datt founder worked for a couple of incompetent start ups before starting this project, I wouldn't hold out
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:18:56
not news
@_date: 2015-10-21 19:50:27
@_date: 2015-11-02 14:25:07
indeed this sub has been better off
@_date: 2015-10-10 07:26:09
what is CN?
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:11:51
trying to patent multisignature is not nice even if you pay up when you fuck up some code.
buttcoiner are better than bitgo employees great!
@_date: 2015-10-09 06:29:46
unlikely because nobody uses XT?
@_date: 2015-10-28 08:46:10
Gavin is just human, he shouldn't be above
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:20:11
yeah, no.
