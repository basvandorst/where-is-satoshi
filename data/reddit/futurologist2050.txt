you contradicted yourself.  Gold having other uses to it other than money by definition give it intrinsic value.
if there was no industrial use for gold and it was merely scarce, then I would be willing to concede it has no intrinsic value.
but this seems to be highly unlikely that gold will never have any useful purpose.

Dude, think about what you are saying.
You are just wrong that my explanation extends to all corporations.  Think outside the box and how you spend money.
Most corporations do provide something in return. 
If I spend 800 bucks on an iPhone, I get a great device that does many things for a long time that makes my life better.
Western Union doesn't do anything like this.  They provide an overcharged service that by design, does nothing other than 'allow' people to move their money.
By design, it is a zero-sum business model that by nature will seek to monopolize rather than innovate.  
Voluntarily spending 5 bucks at Starbucks b/c I just love the Pumpkin Spice latte is not anything like paying a 10 to 15% 'service charge' b/c it's the only means by which a Bangladeshi migrant worker can move his earnings back home from Dubai so his daughter can eat.

|WU is not gouging the poor. They transfer money across the world and give people cash.
these are not mutually exclusive concepts.
Yes, they provide a service.  Nobody is denying that.  The rates at which they do this are obscene. 
It's not just the flat fee that they charge.  It's the exchange rate.  They are giving well below the international rate, taking the difference and going straight to the Forex market and making additional cash.
It's a two-pronged approach to take as much as they can get.
Is that gouging?  I say yes it is.  It's basically a double charge when they are only quoting one.

I haven't done this but I've been planning on it.
I want to get 1 bitcoin for every one of my siblings.
Once I have that, I want to accounce to them I have it saved for them... they will think I'm weird and crazy or be like 'uhhh, ok... yeah sure.'''
But if it takes off, I'm sure they'll thank me for the kind gesture years down the road

| After all of my financial study, until bitcoin, I determined the only reasonably viable 'fire-and-forget' way to save funds in our modern world was technology ETFs. That's a pretty good way to save money, but bitcoin is even better.

Why are we assuming the Western Union ad is protected?  Did WU go through the proper channels to get this ad cooyrighted?

who cares what Alan Greenspan says?  The metallic element that we refer to as gold has very important properties that anybody can look up. 
as long as there is a technical and/or scientific use AND it is very scarce, gold has intrinsic value.
does this mean that gold is undervalued?  not necessarily.  Does it mean that gold should be 500 bucks an ounce?  Or 10,000 bucks an ounce?  
how much gold should be worth is contentious, but one thing is certain, it has value... just as it is.  
scarcity + industrial use = intrinsic value in my book
@_date: 2014-11-22 12:53:54
this is a good analogy.  it doesn't really make sense for WU to use Bitcoin
bitcoin obviates the entire business model of WU

I don't know man.  I kinda feel where OP is coming from.  I don't think he is saying that Bitcoin will solve all the world's problems.
He is pointing out the aspect of independence that it offers.  In this regard, Bitcoin can be a way to distance yourself from an unjust system. 
1% will still run the world but on an individual basis, if you can find a way to live your life on your own terms, there is something ver empowering about it.

What will drive Bitcoin adoption for the consumer is ease of use and people not wanting to carry around cash and coins.  
I think Bitcoin will grow along with things like Apple Pay and Google Wallet rather than leapfrog over them.
Smart watches and wearables will push this farther along as carrying around a physical wallet will start to become more cumbersome and annoying (and pointless).
Another note about consumers... too many folks on here think that Bitcoin can challenge banks and credit cards.  If this ever happens, it will be decades off.  The AMEX CEO has a point when he says that part of the point of credit cards is delayed payment.  Bitcoin is instant as we all know and so for some things, it won't be the best option for the consumer.  However, when buying some tic-tacs at 7-11 and a newspaper?  Yeah, use bitcoin.
Bitcoin is best viewed and marketed for what it was designed for.  
---&gt;  Electronic cash for small purchases either in person or across the internet
To try to push into online retail... I have my doubts b/c there is an actual use for a 3rd party and trust still applies

It doesn't require complete victory.  It needs to nibble away at the fees charged by remittance companies such as Western Union.  
That in and of itself is a very powerful thing.  
Western Union is already trying as hard as they can to go online as much and as quickly as possible.  
They are incentivizing customers to switch to online services by giving much better exchange rates than their over the counter stores.
Why are they doing this?  Because they are scared shitless and they know that unless they adapt, they will be obviated within a decade.
They are scared of PayPay and even Facebook (Facebook has been exploring how to utilize its system to get into the remittance business for a while now).  
I'm sure they have noticed bitcoin.  Bitcoin may or may not emerage is the dominant cryptocurrency.  Maybe it will be Ripple or Hyperledger.  
Whatever it is, it's going to prove the slow undoing of Western Union and the world will be better off.  
In short, an actual free market is starting to emerge when it comes to sending money and Western Union is not positioned well.

Not exactly identical.  Bitcoin has no intrinsic value
@_date: 2014-11-26 05:09:33
Look at it from this perspective.  
Western Union is a corporation that pays a dividend.  That dividend amount has been increasing steadily since 2006.
It isn't unfair to say the following:
The more Western Union gouges the poor so they can move their money to their families, the more Western Union can pay dividends to its investors.  
This is a class 'trickle up' business model if there ever was one.  Stick it to the poor so shareholders can get even more ROI.
The more they can get stick it to the little guy in the name of profits, they WILL DO IT.
So, it seems odd that anybody would defend this type of business model.  
They SHOULD be criticized.  And that ad that has been spoofed IS ridiculous!  5 dollars to send 50 bucks?  That type of thing is technically legal but IMO, it's unethical and morally reprehensible.  
Let them squirm a little.

Facebook has been looking into the remittance business.  I wonder if they will not adopt bitcoin for this very reason.
They have motivations to disrupt the remittance world in their own right...
Adopting ChangeTip could undermine that effort.
