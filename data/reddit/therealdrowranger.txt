This is the bitcoin world's "civil war"

Yeah might be. It was around 13:00 UTC today.  But still, the problem is real :'(

Don't think Peter Todd would agree with you here... Paging: u/petertodd

Mycelium do have a builtin confidence meter for these transactions.  It quickly reached 99%, but still, I didn't feel really secure before the 1 confirmation arrived.

Of course, it depends on your wealth and risk profile, but 5 BTC is not something you want to take too much risk with.  Sometimes you must make larger transactions, and waiting 81 minutes is really hard to justify, no matter how die-hard Bitcoin fan you are.

It was set to the deafult on Mycelium, and the transaction record shows 0.1 mBTC.  No,  there was 2 block in between I think, but also almost 5,000 unconfirmed transactions

Can you spell "switching costs"....  Sorry, it is dum as a brick.

Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely

This is my point too.  Why trash a coin in which you own 50%?

Are you kidding?  POW is a dinosaur.  It is a quick fix with a high price; and evey time I hear people talk warm about it, I understand that there is a pot-commited bias in it.  I'd be surprised if not all alternatives to Bitcoin in the future will use a POS version.  Good example is the latest, Ethereum, with 15s blocktime and POW at the moment, but switching to POS.  Will it work?  No one can tell, but it looks solid to me.

That is so surprising.  Geee what's next? 10 minutes is a great blocktime, and 1 MB size is perfect as well.   
Kodak was pretty pleased with their tech as well.
