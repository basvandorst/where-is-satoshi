Right because if he wanted to steal your wallet he'd link to open-source software instead of some mysterious exe?

I've reverted the edit. I encourage anybody else who objects to also comment on the talk page.

Or I could use my bank to send money to anyone in my country instantly and with no fee.

Tagged it for its non-neutral POV.

It's a few lines long. Go take a look. Being open-source means you, or anybody, can audit the code.

Is there somewhere I can buy a PS4 for BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:06:58
bitstamp will probably be the cheapest. Sites like bitbargain, bittylicious, and localbitcoins are more expensive because they require less validation of who you are.

If something isn't legal tender, that doesn't mean it's illegal to use it.
Eg, in Scotland, only coins are legal tender. Bank notes, even those printed by the Bank of Scotland, are not legal tender, but all shops accept notes including those printed by the Bank of England.

Could you imagine how it must feel if you bought 10,000 in 2010 for essentially a few dollars, and now can't find the wallet you put them in?

I thought coins were stored in the blockchain, never on your computer? This is how paper wallets work, the coins are never stored in the wallet, they're in the blockchain. Your wallet just gives you the right to spend those coins.
