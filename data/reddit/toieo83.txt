this is the disclaimer on lbc
IMPORTANT: If you reside in or are located in New York state we cannot do business with you. Please do not open a trade with us if your ID has a NY address or if you are planning to deposit at a bank in NY state. This is due to New York State's unfortunate Bitlicense requirement.

cash deposit on lbc is a system I'm quite familiar with BUT its apparently not possible in NY because of some regulations. all of the traders on lbc will decline the transaction and most straight up say you'll forfeit your money in the process

well ive been working on this since xrp was at .15 then last week it jumped to .30, effectively doubling any investement. its since come down but will be going back up soon and has been bouncing around between .19-.22 since the bubble burst.
basically I want the btc sitting in an exchange waiting for the price to come down to, what I feel, is the lowest its going to hit and then buy in before it jumps up dramatically again.
there is big news on the horizon for xrp and its going to go up, now is the time to buy in for sure. 
the issue is getting the btc :/ successfully done lbc cash deposits many times in the past and if it were the same in NY this would be long done already but for whatever reason NY wont allow them without a special license and the exchanges that have the license take 1 month to verify and that's too long to wait

Are you saying that bitcoin cash will become the one true bitcoin and that the current "bitcoin" will become extinct? Just trying to make sure I understand what it is you're saying at the bottom line

As per the usual, Blue owners are left holding their dick in one hand and a pile of shit called Blue in the other -_-

It's always "it's coming" and on that FAQ they admit clear as day the Blue is vulnerable. Granted they put a disclosure that it's very unlikely but what company is going to say anything else?? Lol

Lemme know how the return goes for ya.. if possible anyway. I'd hate to go through the process but I hate that my device will forever remain insecure, no matter how difficult it would be to pull off, even more.

You find any info for the Blue?

I posted a link you'd probably find quite interesting in this same thread. Basically saying the same thing as you are with a lot of detail and analysis

Just found out this craziness too!

Moving all my alts to BTC seemed like a good way to come up on free cash if they do give a 1:1 and implement replay protection. Could care less about the BTG as a currency. That being said, do you think that's a bad idea to park my coins in BTC for the night of the 24th to 25th?

I'll look into it, thanks for the suggestion!
