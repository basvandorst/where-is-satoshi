Hey, if someone's dumb enough to run random commands from Reddit, they probably are more suited for Windows hahaha! 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:29:42
 I'm not poor because I pay taxes? I'm just taking issue with it being called "free" when in fact is very expensive. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:49:56
Try another HD wallet aside from mycelium.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:19:03
It's not free.  I pay for that shit.  If you're disabled, I'm happy to help.   If you're a leech, well, you can guess my opinion. Either way, don't pretend it's free.  If it was, i would have an extra 25% of my income.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:07:06
If you actually did the above, do this to fix:  dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/urandom 
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:07:29
Look up HD wallet in Google and read up on the technology of the different BIP formats like BIP32.  The reason you can use your 12 word seed to regen your wallet is the same reason you can do it with another wallet that supports the same format.  
I can't think of the right words this early in the morning, but basically multiple wallets can mathematically support the seeds of others.

Why? What makes you entitled to someone else's earnings?

@_date: 2017-12-23 03:43:02
Think about how shitty everything the government runs, runs.  You really want their hands on your life?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:29:27
Reminds me of The Great Gatsby episode of Family Guy where Peter tells Brian that he's not as good as him because Brian came into his money slightly after Peter. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:18:16
That's your fault lol 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:15:01
There you go making assumptions again.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:07:21
1.  You're barely worth the time this reply took.
2.  I'll take that as a yes.
3.  Lol

We do have Andreas, but he's not in the public spotlight as much as others.  At least not that I've seen.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:02:30
Sorry that you don't know how to set fees? Back to bcash with you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:16:58
The wealthy pay more in taxes in 1 year than you or me will make our entire lives.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:06:31
The rich already pay more taxes than the rest of us.  I do agree that we have plenty of money that is being misused though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:08:37
Move to Cuba then.

406 in your username.  Montana as well? :D 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:27:29
You mean Hillary lying under oath, getting people killed, colluding with the DNC to throw Bernie under the bus, AG Loretta Lynch instructing CIA to call the Hillary investigation a "matter" instead of an investigation, liberals justifying rioting, liberals calling anything that doesn't fit their views "hate speech", liberals insulting, threatening, injuring, and shutting down anyone who speaks in opposition, and conservatives getting tired of being called names and attacked for not agreeing with liberals stop trying and let their votes do the talking had nothing to do with It?  Man, Fox sure does have some pull.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:07:02
We don't have back seats, and I'm not tossing product in my sleeper.  That'll cost ya extra! :D
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:05:57
Wires bruh
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:18:52
Wells Fargo here.  Numerous deposits with no issue.  The only time they freeze my account is when they think my card is stolen because of multi-state purchases in a single day.  One  fixes it though.  Sucks to be a trucker sometimes:P
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:07:38
Well I'll just say I'm glad you're not in a government position of power because we'd be fucked financially.  I say that as a former business owner in the upper tax brackets.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:04:24


What's stopping you? 


Then give up.


As I said, a socialist dream.  We're done here.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:16:17
What point is there in running a business if there is no profit?  What's the motivation? See, you're forgetting that humans will always want more and want better.  There can never be a world where everyone is satisfied and living in perfect harmony. It's not in our nature.  When you get out of the college echo chamber of socialism, you'll understand that. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:52:44
Sounds like you live in a socialist dream.  Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:18:57
 Then you're talking about a very small percentage of the population. At what point does a chain of success and wealth management become the evil 1%? How much success must I achieve and pass on before people start wanting a slice of what my grandchildren have?
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:08:17
Extracting value from labor?  No shit.  Welcome to capitalism.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:01:52
Roger, are you this bored?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:07:44
Oh look, his comment history lists a Detroit phone number.  I wonder what will come of that?
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:28:03
HA0 you doin? :P
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:26:19
To survive, thrive, and prosper is human nature.  If it wasn't, we'd still be living primitive lives.  I'm not sure why you took two separate parts of what I said and tried to stitch them together so you can make it look like i said something incorrect so you can call me on it.    
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:01:46
I love you.  Shoot me a public btc address so I can tip you for this chuckle.

I put two limits on my book. One at 6600 that I'm confident in and one at 6500 that would be nice but I'm not super confident in. If neither trigger, fuck it, still hodling!

Cheer up bro.  You didn't lose 600k.  You lost 100 bucks.   The money would be nice, sure, but don't beat yourself up over losing something you never had.  Don't let this consume you.  Nothing has changed. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:24:26
Sure was!  :3

Post an address. I want to contribute to your donation.  This could gain traction and bring good publicity to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:39:10
Not for the amount I planned to deposit. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:05:43
They ask "where within Kurdistan?" City, region, area, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:30:09
Is that even legal? Can they tell you what you can and can't buy?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:17:49
Um, you don't have to purchase an entire share of a stock either.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:39:05
I am.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:50:20
He didn't say testicle.  He said ball.  Lots of wiggle room in that statement!

Nah, this is a 1 day old phone that hasn't touched any wifi.  It's something server side it seems.

You live a very sheltered life.  How much land are you buying for 10k? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:21:37
You're adorable.
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:23:48
Used in Mississippi in the 90s and early 2000s.  Not so much nowadays.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:59:38
Well,  5m divided by 1,000 is 5k. 5k divided by 365.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:15:53
Yours held out longer than mine :/

Ah, *there's* my 4:30am teary cackle that signals I'm up way past my bedtime.
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:21:08
Why do you have to own 1 whole coin?
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:35:07
Yeah, lemme just get land, animals, and everything for free somehow.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:09:19
Closer to adopters I'd say. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:42:01
"Hove, actually." 
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:22:39
It shows up on the device's display.
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:44:37
Yes.  Some people are under the impression that 1.0 is the minimum you can own. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:42:17
Would it make sense to paper my btc, claim the fork coins, convert fork coins to btc, then import my papered btc so that I only have btc again? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:35:24
Dunno.  I just know that one detail about the Trezor.  Im not invested enough to need a hardware wallet yet, but when I do, my paranoid ass will be using a vm of some sort, maybe a livecd linux.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:57:14
Bruh, if I had irrigated land, a few cows, sheep, chickens, etc and could live off grid sustainably, I'd be euphoric.  I'd make my own clothing.  I'd generate my own power.  I'd miss nothing of the modern world.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:58:40
Are there any consequences to doing nothing and just waiting?
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:00:58
As I said, you live a sheltered life.
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:14:53
You said "drive off to the countryside."  That's a little different than traveling (which is not cheap) to a "developing country", obtaining whatever citizenship rights that are required to purchase and own property, then start from scratch.
You're moving the goalposts.  You're sheltered.  You're dumb.  I'm done.
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:45:23
Not to say that Bitcoin is merely an investment, but rule  of investing: never go into debt to invest.  You now have a serious liability hanging over your head chasing something that could disappear tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:30:45
I'm still pretty new to this.  Why should I move my btc from mycelium? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:55:18
Similar dream here except in MT :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:57:02
0.03 here. I'm watching these gains and kicking myself for not starting sooner.  I think it's time.
