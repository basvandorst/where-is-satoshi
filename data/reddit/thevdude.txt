The trolling being the "Bitcoin is crashing SELL SELL SELL" posts and irc was full of it. While I wanted more selling (a floor of 6 would've been great for me) the crashing part was just silly.

Yeah, it's a shame. Back at 20usd last I checked. Hopefully it will pick up more when people have money with dwolla.

Because everyone was telling people to sell. That may have started it, but the trolling took it so low.

The creator was in irc earlier. MySQL stuff. Should be fixed soon.

Back up to 20 now. On sunday. When people still can't wire money. I feel 40 hitting early in the week.

Bitcoin CAN be used for illegal things. Most people are using it as speculation, not currency. Hence people wondering about the value of it.

This only works when the price is going up. D:

The dollar isn't currently that volatile.

I bought one already, message me how much you'd charge. If I read everything right, 1BTC ~ $31 USD or so?
@_date: 2011-06-12 00:45:45
Me too, but I only bought 2 BTC. D:

I understand there is a level of trust. I'm not talking about the $1000 scale, but the $30 scale. I got it taken care of, though.

OVER 100?! I ONLY HAVE 8!

Bought 2 at 35, holding until they are around $45 and spending them.

Why would you invest so high? SRS talk.
