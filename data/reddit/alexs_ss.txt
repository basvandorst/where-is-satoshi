Specially on markets outside the US you have a premium of 10-15% not only in btc but in all coins against the local fiat. If you find a way to move money across exchanges quickly you are in for a big return.

When this happens, as I am sure it will happen at some time, we will see a big raise with all that new money from the gulf.

They will at some point, I think btc will be the first to do so. We will probably see it in the next couple of years.

TradingView is a good option for all cryptos.

Considering the influence they have in the global economy, crypto mining would be the least of my worries.

Looks good and simple, good job! I think you should at least sort the coins by name and if possible add a summary of the coins you have added.

[Jaxx]( is a good option, however if you are looking for an offline option I would recommend you [Trezor](

I don’t think it will, more regulation may even increase the price as more people will feel comfortable investing in crypto.

Too long, I bet that at some point a lot of people thought that paper notes would **never** replace shiny gold coins. I think that governments will start regulating cryptos and they will become more stable in terms of value which will pave the path for higher adoption.

That's not necessarily true, value is not based on adoption rates. The increase we are seeing right now is more related to the influx of money from new investors.

Thanks, I am trying to focus on white papers reviews as I have not seen many when looking for information of crypto coins.
