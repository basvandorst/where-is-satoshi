Hey guys I don't expect any donations and I won't be posting an address to send to but I was wondering if anyone could help me with setting up not only taking donations via bitcoin but if there is a good platform that takes cash or wires and transfers to Bitcoin for my organization. 
I just found bitwala which will allow us to mobilize Bitcoin funds directly to our workers in remote parts of Kenya via mpesa with 0 transaction fees which is amazing! But there are still wire fees to get our cash donations into Bitcoin/bitwala, and a lot of things I don't understand such as how to show accountability if I take our fiat donations and transfer to btc to send funds to Kenya rather than to the Kenyan bank account for our organization
 I am relatively new to crypto but smart enough to buy in a few months ago for myself, made a few profitable investments in alt coins and also build a mining rig though admittedly I'm just using nicehash at this time. 
Anyone who is willing to help will be recognized as a volunteer of women of lake Victoria and receive our members news letter and a tee shirt for helping us set up a faster and more reliable transfer method than being at the mercy of banks in both Europe and kenya, I started researching bitcoin for our organization when we attempted to send money to Kenya for our workers salary's and the bank here in Sweden refused to process our transaction due to how volitile the Kenya shilling was that week, this meant rather than gambling a few percent of what we sent we were totally enable to help those we promised and made us feel useless :/ 
helping us set this up and running would be way bigger help than currency donations of *most* sizes because being able to send the donations we already get fast and efficiently is more important than actually getting more donations right now. Please comment back or PM if you would like to get in touch with me and help
