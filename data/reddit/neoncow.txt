It's actually a little more subtle than that. The point of a land tax is that you don't have to tax crypto, so it just avoids the issue altogether. It someone holds all the world's wealth in crypto, but never exercises it then why should they be taxed? 
The crypto assets don't consume world resources for other people. But if they decide to cash out and buy mansions/Lamborghinis then suddenly they'll be consuming land that affects other people. The land tax will tax it appropriately if they use valuable land. 
(Indirectly the crypto is taxed by the resources used by miners, so less efficiently crypto is taxed by consuming more material resources. Those material resources require land.)


If land becomes irrelevant for food production, that's fine too. People need land for living on too. 
Pigovian taxes for things like pollution/carbon, are a good pairing for land tax, but Pigovian taxes are pretty good economic pairings with any sort of taxes really.

Wealth inequality doesn't have an easy answer, but I'm strongly convinced that a push towards land tax + universal basic income will greatly help with the situation. And it's totally compatible with cryptos meaning, you can have cryptos and still tax land and it will allow people to use cryptos to make the world better while also reducing wealth inequality.

It can be similar to a consumption tax like a VAT, but VATs require all sorts of paper trails and reporting in order to calculate the total VAT paid by a business and the total VAT collected. 
A land tax is rather simple, the land is worth some amount and you pay the tax. It doesn't matter if you run a million dollar business on it or you have the land empty for your pleasure. This encourages people to put land to good use.








A land tax encourages building upward. The tax is based off the unimproved value of the land. 
Say you have two equal valued pieces of land. On plot A, you build that arcology and on plot B, you build a parking lot.
Both will pay the same land tax (based on the unimproved value of the land). The arcology is obviously worth a lot more than the parking lot. The land tax encourages the parking lot owner to develop their land as well as the arcology owner.
If you're interested is one of the bigger land value tax subreddits. The wikipedia page is quite good as well.

Land value tax + basic income. Tax wealth, subsidize people. Compatible with Cryptos + automation, because all humans require land to live. Therefore most human material wealth correlates to land. 
Essentially a wealth tax that's mostly already implemented in the form of property taxes. Get rid of income taxes, transaction taxes, estate taxes, corporate taxes, and just tax wealth.

You're asserting that the spam transactions are priced below the fee price to confirm quickly.
So all the transactions being confirmed now are real and paying a high price. Therefore there is more real transactions being created than being confirmed. 
If there are more transactions than capacity, fees will go up. 
If there were fewer transactions than capacity, the real transactions would confirm and then non-evil miners would eat away at the spam transactions and cost the spammers millions of dollars. The top of the mempool continues to grow.

Segwit produces positive externalities. Putting effort into implementing it benefits other people.
Bitcoin isn't built for decentralized individuals to pay costs to benefit others. Bitcoin takes greedy individuals and structures incentives so individual profit benefits the whole. Segwit alone doesn't do that.
Segwit as a scaling solution doesn't incentivize individuals to use it unless lightning network can prove itself. Since LN isn't ready, people won't have individual incentives to implement segwit.

You're all over the place. This abrupt 50% wealth tax is just an example by the person above. Geez. I'm not that person, but read it, he's talking about the idea of taxing the richer more than the poorer. It's a discussion about progressive tax rates. It wasn't a proposal for a literal 50% tax. Your blanket statement about all taxation is theft is a blatant close your eyes and cover your ears response to a discussion. 
You condemning the 1% on one hand and on the other don't realize that properly structured taxes are one of the biggest tools to keep a check on the 1%'s power. An unchecked 1% results in an aristocracy of the wealthy, we've done this before in history. 
Capitalism is a powerful force for wealth generation and some light redistribution is a powerful force for individual liberties. Wealth tends to concentrate and enormous concentrations of wealth/power is usually bad news for individual liberty. 
The other extreme is when the wealthy get too obvious about it and the masses rise up and take through real violence. Populist revolts have happened many times in history and I would suggest it's bad for both the wealthy and the poor. It's better to head it off with some redistribution before it comes to real violence. It's a compromise.
It's like when paradox of leftists focusing on extreme tolerance so much so that eventually they need to use intolerance to prevent the intolerant from harming others.
On the right, extreme individual liberty requires restriction of some individual liberties to prevent the wealthy/powerful from restricting the liberties of the many.

Look at the mempool chart. Blocks are at full capacity and clearing transactions as fast as they can.
Even if you remove the bottom ones, you still expect to clear transactions transactions from the top. And at full capacity clearing from the top, the highest fee transactions are still piling up.
For the spamming hypothesis to work, the spammers must be putting in high value transactions to block the front of the line.
Imagine you're trying to get into a club. But the line allows people to pay to get in front. This is the mempool. If the club is full, there's only going to be so many people who can fit. Do only so many people at the front of the line will ever get in. People who want to get in will bid up the price.
If only 1000 people can get in, it doesn't matter if you add a billion people paying a low fee after the 1,500th person. It makes no difference who gets in, because you can outbid the low fees. Only 1000 people will get in and the spammer will need to bid more than the 1000th person in line.
Because of the capacity of the club, everyone after 1000 people are irrelevant.

Then your solution to remove 0-200 sat transactions is nonsense and now you're contradicting your original statements.


None of what you said explains why it's spam. It's going up could easily be explained by demand for legitimate transactions are going up. Especially since the price has tripled in very few months. 


You're assuming there is spam, seeing evidence of transactions are going up, and concluding it's spam. Don't you see how circular it is?
And I'm not saying your solution is good and needs to improve. I'm saying removing 0-200 transactions actively harms the reputation of the bitcoin network. Removing transactions undermines the trust in the network and that reduces the value of the entire blockchain.
And if it were spam, removing those transactions eliminates the cost to spammers and thus you're making it even cheaper to do.

Bringing up a block increase in order to buy more time to properly finish segwit and LN would not have destroyed the network.

If lightning network increases the value of the whole Bitcoin blockchain while decreasing the profits of miners, that means the value from attacking the blockchain increases while the value of protecting the block chain decreases. 
Level two transactions depend on the security of level one transactions. Since the level one transactions must be done directly on the blockchain, it is essential that the blockchain is secure. Bitcoin's security is built on hashing power. The hashing power of the Bitcoin network must be so large that it is infeasible to attack it with hashing power. 
Thus, you must reassure miners that they will profit from the increased value of the Bitcoin blockchain. The security of Bitcoin depends on miners being greedy and acting in only the pursuit of profit. Without this fundamental greed, Bitcoin has no hashing power and therefore, no trust. 
Focus the messaging on how the second layer will benefit the miners. This is the story that needs to be told, because the story of a second layer network superficially sounds like it's abandoning the base network when in fact it depends on and benefits the base network.

But you're saying that 1) there's enough space if there was no spam. 2) bad miners are focusing on higher fee Txns. 3) good miners are also focusing on highest fee txns.
The way you describe it, the behavior of good miners and bad miners is the same.
So thern if there's enough space, all the high fee transactions should be cleared out in good time. 
So it's not the miners fault, it's wallets for giving poor fee advice. If we fix wallet advice, then spam has zero effect?

So bad miners are not producing low fee spam, they're producing high fee spam? Wouldn't this incentivize good miners to collect the bad miners' high fee transactions? That would severely blunt the profit of the spam attacks and bolster the profits of good miners.
I'm still pretty confused. I don't think the fee market is perfect, but it seems like it wouldn't be affected by a simple seeming attack like this.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:10:42














I'm confused about the spam attacks. There's plenty of capacity that's being blocked by spam.
So assertion 1: a large percentage of miners are colluding to game the fee market to raise prices (25% for example) and profit. 
Assertion 1a: There's plenty of capacity that's being blocked by spam.
Assertion 2: they do this by generating spam transactions defined as low fee transactions.
Assertion 3: They fill their blocks with these spam transactions to save on fees.
Assertion 4: They then fill other blocks with the artificially high fees for profit.
But assertion 3 and 4 contradict. If the blocks were full from 3, then the 75% of good (or greedy) miners will get the high fee transactions in 4? The evil miner doesn't profit.
Ok, so scratch assertion 3 and 4.
Assertion 3a: They fill their first blocks with the artificially high fee transactions for profit.
But 3a contradicts the assertion that spam is filling the blocks. With 3a, the evil miners are filling their blocks with real transactions, which lowers the transaction time for real transactions and lowers fees again. Plus other miners will eat their spam transactions and this will make the attack more costly.

It won't cost the act of spamming any more, but the spam transactions are low fee and can be ignored by regular profit seeking miners.
I may have gotten the wrong thread. Others are asserting that the low fee transactions make a base to the backlog and push legit transactions to higher prices. Thus manipulating the market and artificially raising the market fee price.
Assuming a miner intending to manipulate the fee market, you can counter it with users who decide to push the fees down in the same way. Manipulating miners will lose revenue and normal miners will take the fees from the users.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:48:58


But then they're using up their own space and not accepting legitimate transactions, they'll be giving up those fee profits to other miners?
They're greedy by giving away fees?
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:24:15
That only works if users set their fees higher. 
If it's all fake, then users should call the bluff and bid fees lower. This will cost miners a lot of money and they'll have to pull in the higher fee transactions to make money. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:15:35


But if there is plenty of space for them to a) fill blocks with the legit transactions and also b) to fill them with the spam transactions, then the pool should be clear of high fee transactions and the fees would be low again. That contradicts the assertion that the spam pushes the fee up.

Why? Miners are in the business of making money. If there's not enough money for making a bigger block, they can wait for a less busy time.

The longest chain becomes the true chain, so it's important to get the block shared to other miners first. During the time it's still propagating, if a smaller block is also found at the same chain length, miners who hear about the smaller block first will consider that block the longest chain. 
A smaller block naturally reaches more miners faster. So if a smaller block and a larger block are found at the same time, it's more likely that more miners will be looking for the next block following the smaller block than the larger block.
If the majority of the miners mine the next block first then they have a two block chain length advantage. This is longer than the big block chain and orphans the big block. 
At least that's my understanding.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:55:13


It's a maximum. When it's expensive, miners could choose to make smaller blocks. Essentially you can marry the fee market with the blocksize market. If fees are high enough to justify larger blocks, then bigger blocks get issued. If fees are too low for operating expense of larger blocks, then blocks naturally get smaller.
Also if block sizes are too big, it takes too long for the bigger blocks to propagate across the network and possibly be orphaned by a smaller block. Miners have an automatic financial incentive to prevent orphaned blocks. If the network cannot handle it, miners will lose money by trying to make blocks too big. 
It applies competition to apply to the blocksize and allows the market to decide how big they should be.

I think it's an important part of preventing monarchies and aristocrats. 
I don't think all wealth should be redistributed, but there should be at least a gentle push to resist a concentration of wealth into the hands of the few.
High wealth inequality (and consequently power inequality) allows the few to destroy many things that I hold dear. Human rights, constitutional rights, personal liberty, freedoms of choice, market systems.
All of these things you might take for granted, but history assures us that there's no physical law of the universe that will ensure we are free from inequality.
Inflation is one of those artificial systems put in place that attempts to redistribute from the few to the many. It's not perfect and is often abused, but I think working to keep it managable is better than working to eliminate it.

@_date: 2017-09-08 01:04:36
How so?
Assuming a productive machine generates 10% ROI, if inflation is at 2%, holding currency gives negative returns. This encourages someone to invest in the 10% ROI machine.
If deflation is at 2%, then the ROI on the machine is reduced relative to the currency. So there is less incentive to invest in the machine.
Currency itself is not a productive asset. It doesn't house anyone, it doesn't feed anyone, it doesn't generate other goods, it doesn't generate services.

This doesn't make sense. If you don't have money, you're not going invest in either an inflationary economy or a deflationary economy... So it's not a benefit of one over the other. Being poor in both scenarios suck.
Worse, if you have a deflationary economy and no money, lenders would be less likely to lend you money because they have an incentive to just hold onto the money themselves.


This doesn't follow either, because everybody else has the same incentive as you to hoard money. If you know about deflation, everyone else also knows its effects and has the same incentive to hoard currency over investing in non-currency productive assets.

Did you see where I advocated for capitalism and free people? Free markets doesn't mean unregulated markets. Ultra ideological purity is a more extreme stance than trying to blend the best of multiple ideologies into a compromise. 
When you take freedom to the extreme, it results in lack of freedom. Should I be free to own slaves? A class of ultrawealthy individuals can make that happen unless some power opposes them. Today that power is government, but it's being assaulted by those ultrawealthy already. 
I don't care if the power is religion, the government, the masses, or a benevolent AI. Today, government is the one I distrust the least. 






This is an extreme statement. If wealth concentration gets too high, the powers that control the wealth controls your freedom. In some eras, its the government, in some eras its the church, sometimes it's the mob of people itself, sometimes monarchs, or aristocracy, or the merchant class. 
Today, I believe corporations and authoritarians are the biggest threat. Extreme wealth inequality will make them worse and that's why I believe it needs to be redistributed.
Because I believe that markets and capitalism are powerful and useful forces, I don't think all the wealth needs to be redistributed. I believe it's ok for someone to be fabulously wealthy, but that initial wealth should be taxed so that by itself, it could only last 2-3 generations. Again, it doesn't need to be extreme and if the next generations actually build on the wealth, then they'll reset the clock. Those that sit on it and don't contribute to the world will see it dwindle. I believe a land value tax + UBI would be a good start in this direction. 


Government and bureaucracy is inefficient, but if you value freedom and transparency that inefficiency + slowness is the price you pay. And yes, I agree the government goes too far in terms of privacy and secrecy in some places and I want those things to change for the better. 
No government is perfect, no human institution is.


I don't advocate for pure socialism. That's why I said all wealth doesn't need to be redistributed. We can reap some of the advantages of socialism by a light redistribution and giving everybody an opportunity to succeed. If they squander that chance, then we can say we at least gave them a chance.

In Russia, oligarchs control a huge portion of the economy and government.

Bitcoin has some useful properties. Useful properties are worth something thus people place value in Bitcoin. Please read something and ask specific questions if you don't understand. Check out the "Why?" section on the Bitcoin wiki: 


The mining rate for Bitcoin is set so that there will eventually only be 21 million coins created. Thus eventually Bitcoin will become a deflationary currency. Please read about Bitcoin and ask specific questions as appropriate.

To really really understand it, you should understand public key cryptography and read the original paper about bitcoin.
Otherwise, you can think of bitcoins as existing out there on the blockchain, which is essentially a public record of all transactions.
Your wallet is the key that allows you to authorize changes to your set of bitcoins. When you make a transaction, you use your private key to authorize a transaction to your public wallet (which is actually your PUBLIC key). Using the magic of public key cryptography, everyone can confirm you have the private key without you actually giving out your private key. Then as more people confirm it they add it to the blockchain and it becomes permanent by consensus.

I think that was his original point. If some sellers were holding up the market at fixed points, they must have been dumping a lot of BTC and given how fast they jumped afterwards, the sellers could probably have gotten more had they waited.

Yes, but how do you get the Somali cash in the first place? Isn't the whole point of the article that sending money into Somalia is hard? Reading up on [Hawala]( it seems like a Bitcoin based scheme would be fairly similar in that a lot of the operation depends on trust. Would banks who snub Hawala operations willingly accept a Bitcoin based operation?
It appears the same objections used to ban Hawala can be applied to Bitcoin (from a legal point of view).

Doesn't this mean that most everyone is already a follower? Either following big "economic" players, following big "hash power" players, or big "developer group" players.
So then the idea that Bitcoin is still decentralized doesn't really matter so much? Each of the player groups even though they have leaders and wield a bunch of united power in the ecosystem can ultimately still balance each other out and also be replaced by other individuals if their message is not reaching the small players.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:28:35
Yeah, if you want to measure the miner support, you measure hash power. If you want to measure economic support, you need to measure something market based.
Node count is likely correlated with the market consensus, but not nearly to the degree that hash power is correlated to miner consensus.

I don't like mining because it implies that if you have more shovels you can look for more metal. In Bitcoin if you have more shovels, you get a larger percentage of the metal mined in the world, but then the metal gets harder to find.
A draw is a much better analogy. There's a draw ever 10 minutes and if you have more computing power, you have more chance of winning the draw. The problem with the draw analogy is that people don't understand statistics.
Mining is used as an analogy because people don't understand math.

If the transaction fees get too high, trusted middle men will come in and provide the service of tracking transactions through external servers the same way that people are suggesting that Satoshi dice act as a trusted middle man and do the gambling calculations off the block chain. A trusted middle man can be the "Paypal" of Bitcoin. Which would be a super bizarre situation, but it's essentially what Mtgox does anyway. They handle all the "exchange" related behaviour behind the scenes and only touch the blockchain when you want to deposit or withdraw.

**Mid-2013**: Snake McGraw starts a newsletter and charges Bitcoin for predictions on the price movements of with a note at the top that he is always wrong. At first only a few skeptics would follow and his newsletters contain humorous references to fun hobby income as he rides the BTC market. 
**Early-2014**: The 0% track record continues, skeptics have become believers. Their first experimental forays into the day trading market were guided by oracle like anti-wisdom. Their petty bets and trades have become small fortunes. 
**Late-2014**: A cult of personality has formed around the mysterious savant of anti-prediction. Every prediction is researched and backed up by the best predictive models that Bitcoin can buy. 
Yet they are inevitably wrong. The golden 0% track record. No matter the peer reviewed resources, every prediction that Snake McCraw has approved has failed to materialize. Rumor has it that Snake McGraw's private key is backed up in bank vaults next to Nazi gold. Every newsletter is personally signed with his private key and an amusing anecdote.
Time after time, each prediction falls.
**February 2015**: The international Bitcoin economy roil as the McGraw Alliance surpasses 51% hashing power.
**March 2015**: Nothing happens and BTC continues its unrelenting deconstruction of traditional market. Bitcoin will find a way.
**May 27th, 2015**: All is ruins. The golden streak has finally ended. In a final newsletter, broadcast to 10,000 loyal followers McGraw broadcast a final prediction. And he was right. Actually, he was wrong. That is, the prediction that he would predict wrong was contradicted. He wrongly, predicted his failure to predict... well, you know what I mean.
Fortunes built on the golden path were torn asunder and many uncautious speculators lost everything.
**July 2015**: A quiet figure lounges on a beach in Bali sipping on cocktail.

Nicely told, I've been working with a lot of financial types recently and occasionally the topic of Bitcoin comes up.

One disadvantage with non-reddit based forums is that threads that get to the top are the ones that people post in a lot. So basically, the most vocal people get heard. Visibility is based on being loud.
One advantage of reddit is that you can theoretically vote on quality. Visibility is based on quality. Theoretically, this nets us some good comments. Obviously it depends on the community and their value of 'quality'.

One major problem I see is a lack of communication about how wallets work. All layman explanations go over blocks, addresses, and transactions. Some even discuss how addresses are public private key pairs and all that. 
Yet none of the explanations touch on how wallets work. So people assume that a wallet is an address. When I had no Bitcoin, I saw the receiving functionality and recognized "addresses". I had assumed that when I sent money out, I would choose which address to send from and/or how much to send from each address. 
This is still confusing to me and I'm still experimenting. The fees are eating my small starting capital haha. Bear in mind that I have a computer background and actually understand how public-private keys work. Imagine your layman who doesn't even have that foundation. They require layer upon layer of trust to even understand a wallet.
Another aspect is fee generation. Bitcoin-qt has a popup that forces you to pay fees. There should be an explanation as to why there is a fee. e.g. show the actual size of your transaction, label as "too big". Show the number of addresses that your transaction receives input from and label it as "Too many" etc.
Right now it just says that you have to pay a fee because it's too big: Yes/Cancel.

For 96,000 BTC a few users could chip together some coin and hire some data analytics people to follow the guy's trail around.

If I were the NSA or the mafia or whatever organization interested in Bitcoin, I'd be reaching out to data researchers. If someone is trying to manage coins manually, he's going to leave patterns that can be picked up.

Or to go with a number example, in Prolog you might say something like:
I'm thinking of a number.
It's divisible by two.
It's between 1 and 10.
It's also divisible by 3.
And then ask the question, what's my number?
Prolog would then reply with the set of numbers that it could be.

Banks are required by law to make a reasonable effort to prevent money laundering or face fines. Your transactions look like money laundering. 
Basically they thought you were doing money laundering and are legally required to report large transfers with that type of pattern. When they heard Bitcoin, it raised red flags and they cut you off since it wasn't worth the risk of prison or massive fines.

It's actually the same thing due to opportunity cost. If the miners are holding the coins, they're passing off the opportunity to sell them at current prices. Choosing to not sell them is economically equivalent to buying them. Psychologically, it may be different but they're paying the opportunity cost in holding them.
Every bitcoin you don't sell is an instance of you saying that you require more fiat for your coin.

OP is implying that the block value and energy prices are linked since an excess in block value will attract more competition to mine. Thus reducing individual profit for mining. As profit is reduced, the cost of mining approaches the energy cost.

I just wanted to point out that one of the features you like was 'based on mistrust'. The reason you have to download the blockchain is because you don't trust other people to manage the transactions for you. 
There are different levels of mistrust. Starting from the fully trusting side, you could fully trust someone else to manage your wallet for you. There are online wallet services that do this. Blockchain.info is one of those. Their reputation is based on their history of not stealing other people's money, some fancy code that they've written to allow your computer to secure the transactions, and that people have not yet caught them doing anything bad.
If you trust them less, you can download a client that only downloads part of the blockchain. I believe this is how Electrum and the Android phone app works. The partial blockchain on your computer will give you a reasonable amount of trust in the transaction history, but it means your client will rely more on the peers that it connects to. So your trust is placed in other people who claim to be running the full client. Since most nodes on the bitcoin network currently run the main bitcoin software, it is likely that you will be safe. As attackers get more sophisticated, it's possible that this assumption will no longer hold and people would be able to scam your partial blockchain client.
It's not simple right now. All this stuff is very new and still developing.

Oh, I understand how they are put together and why you want wallets that way. I'm just saying that it isn't very clear that they DO work that way. There's no sign that says, hey your sending address is going to hide change coins somewhere else by default. Or that when you back up your wallet you could potentially lose addresses by sending/receiving transactions.
I think those are details of how the individual systems work, but very important in the fact that they are subtly different from the common explanations being communicated to newbies and have potential to cause huge damage when misunderstood (e.g. irreversible loss of funds).

20 transactions of 0.01 = 0.2 BTC of trades.
MtGox makes 0.6%, so they earn 0.0012 BTC.
At 96USD, they earn 0.1152 USD from the Bitcoin side of the trade. 
Since MtGox makes money from the USD side of the trade too, you double it.
So they made approximately 0.2304 USD in seconds.
Assuming "A few seconds ago" means in the last 7 seconds, they made approximately 1.97 USD per minute or 118.49 USD per hour.
That's what MtGox is doing about it.

Having your PC on versus having your PC mining Bitcoin 24/7 is a very different thing. While mining, your computer will use much much more electricity. Due to the advancing Bitcoin mining technology, your desktop mining may be very inefficient. You may be better of simply donating $100 to a charity of your choice in whatever country you reside. This would save the use of electricity to mine BTC inefficiently, earn you a tax deduction, and get money to the charity much much faster than if you were to mine until you get 1 Bitcoin.

Brain wallets are for people paranoid about getting their computer hacked and losing their Bitcoins. 
The separate change addresses are people worried about quantum cryptography dismantling the very algorithms that keep all modern internet security.
I'd say both are security theatre, but one is more likely to happen to people now. Maybe in 130 years, quantum computing will be a big worry for Bitcoiners, but for now wallet loss is probably the biggest threat to your assets. Or getting scammed when doing a transaction.

This is an interesting approach. I was thinking from a financial planning perspective, an alternate planning method would be to  allocate a certain percentage of your investments to be held in BTC. If the percentage exceeds your goal, then you can use the BTC to purchase goods (or fiat). When the percentage falls below your goal, you can top up using your income.

I don't know the specifics of the bitcoin exchange, but I understand [public key cryptography]( I write this post assuming the audience is familiar with Public key cryptography.
Addresses are hashes of the public key. So knowing an address and receiving money to an address doesn't expose the actual public key.
Let's say A sends coins to B. 
What happens is that A writes a message that says, I send money to B's public key. People now know the hash of B's public key. To authorize that transaction, A must "Sign" the message using their private key portion of the address. This signing operation doesn't actually expose the private key, but in order to validate the signature A must post the public key. With this information, other miners can verify that A's address, the hash of their public key, is associated with the actual public key (verified via hashing). And then that the signature is associated with the public key (verified via public key cryptography).
In a normal cryptographic environment, this would be fine to keep the private key, but apparently there are fears of quantum computing in the Bitcoin community. With quantum computing, it is theorectically easier to derive the private key from the public key.
Given the expected duration of the project, perhaps these fears are well founded. But perhaps it we have a lot of time to not destroy people's money and give them the choice the quantum proof their money in the future by simply reactivating the feature and sending their money to a new address.

It's because of the mining analogy. They're trying to shoehorn the difficulty changes into an approximate analogy. In mining, the more you dig the more you find. And we all know that Bitcoin is subtly different. 
I prefer the distributed lottery draw explanation. "Mining" is a lottery that pays out at roughly predefined intervals and the more people playing, the more tickets get issued. One ticket is chosen per draw and the holder gets the prize. The more processing power you have, the more tickets you buy. 
That's enough for a non technical explanation. If someone wants to know what's really going in, you give a high level of the blockchain, proof of work, and the difficulty setting. Deeper than that, you'll eventually need to talk math at people. 
Know your audience.

The different chains would have to be perfectly balanced. The longer the fork continues, the more risk there would be for every miner. It's in the miner's best interest to join the chain they think will will. If the larger pools stuck with the new chain, then people would switch due to the fear or losing everything by staying on the old chain.
In this case, the developers thought the fallout from the changes would be smaller by having people join the old chain. The miners agreed and jumped ship. If you disagreed and stayed on the old chain, your mining efforts were wasted since everyone else will now ignore your blocks. So it becomes in your best interest to go with the consensus. You wouldn't be doing very much good sticking around on the "wrong" chain.

That's my point. I'd like to know too. When sending some money for testing, the Bitcoin client said my transaction was too big and gave me a Yes/cancel button and no other options or explanations.
When I was sent a transaction with a much larger amount, I excitedly looked it up in the block chain and noticed that the fee was 0 BTC. Scared me into thinking the transaction would be delayed for a couple of days, but it confirmed on the next block.
I did the research and apparently two factors are the transaction size and the oldness of the address. Given the distributed nature of the whole thing, I'm sure these factors will evolve, but it was confusing given the way the wallet presents that information.
If you're curious about fees, browse any of the latest blocks on blockchain.info. Here's an example:

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the point you're making is that the set of people who are miners is not exactly the same as the total set of bitcoin nodes. Nodes may or may not mine, but are ultimately the ones who determine consensus if they outnumber the miners.

I read somewhere to back up your wallet after creating new addresses. I understand this is for the new private keys you create. 
What I didn't get was the advice to backup after 100 transactions. Does that advice make any sense?

The 10% profits are given out when the Bar is worth small amounts. The 100% loss happens when the bar is worth bigger amounts.
Small profits + big loss = ? (Insert calculus here, probably some sort of infinite series theorems or something)
Maybe will know.

If you're smart enough to convince half the hashing power of Bitcoin to switch to your chain, then you win.

Was the 0.001 part of the sending transaction fee? It sounds a bit high for that...
What type of software are you using for your wallet? You could lookup the default transaction fee for that particular software.

Interesting. Is it the people running the regular clients that are complaining? 
As I understand, they get the benefit of seeing the full blockchain. Assuming they're not mining, they'll pay the price of bandwidth and some CPU to simply transmit the SD transactions, yet will gain none of the benefits of the transaction fees. 
Did I miss anything?

I like your cashflow interpretation and the above poster's notation. Upvotes for all.

Right and by passing the transactions or raising the cost of the transactions, the miners get a piece of that. Or are the gamblers currently putting put very enormous fees that are blocking out other transactions?
My understanding is that these gamblers are putting up approximately 0.0005BTC ~= 2 cents USD for transaction fees. Is this considered a lot?

First time I've heard of cashpoint charges. From a Canadian perspective, we usually only pay with withdraw money from ATMs if the ATM is run by a different bank than the account you're withdrawing from.
How does it work where you are (UK, I assume)?

How does the difficulty scaling algorithm work? I would have assumed that the difficulty would simply scale up so that confirmations would take more than 10 minutes until the mining blocks were no longer ahead of schedule. Is that how it actually works?

I see what you did there.

I wonder what kind of physical security is customary for this size of transaction.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:32:29
Thanks for the insight, but wouldn't the nature of the fee naturally discourage micro-transactions? By definition, micro-transactions are very small and the fee would eat up the transacted value, thus naturally discouraging small transactions.

Engaging them in discussion is pretty tiring. There's a big wall of ignorance. But plenty of curiosity.
Guys think of it like a sell wall (I'm not a trader so I have no idea if that's the right terminology). There's a huge ignorance resistance and it'll take a lot of curiosity and explaining to break it down.

It's so frustrating seeing all the USD options and trying to get some BTC with CAD. Been looking around and the fees are so much higher and it seems like everything takes longer to fund with CAD. Not sure where to jump yet. I've watched BTC jump from 50 to 70 while doing research.. BTC is nuts.
I hope this works out! Looks like they're promising easy funding options. A good sign.

Mining nodes are the ones who control which transactions get into the blocks. Which is definitely very very important.
Who controls which transactions are transmitted through the network and who controls which blocks are transmitted through the network?
My understanding is that the answer is: the collective consensus of all nodes including BOTH the miners and the non-mining nodes (e.g., Bitcoin-qt users) is what controls the blockchain.
I'd be glad to be corrected as I haven't found the documentation for the nodes and can't confirm they are propagating transactions AND blocks. I believe that's the whole point of the p2p network though.

Or the seller has to sends the product and the buyer claims it didn't arrive and takes the money back. Basically an escrow still requires someone to go first and whether it's the buyer or the seller, one person could still be screwed.

I suspect that if you want a Bitcoin based transaction card system (I wouldn't call it a 'credit card' anymore, for obvious reasons) that provides all the benefits of a credit card, like customer protection, reward points, extended warranties, then the main saving you would get as a customer would come from the elimination of infrastructure costs for the transaction processor. All that other stuff, like customer protection, merchant protection or actual lines of credit would still cost money even with Bitcoin as the processor.
Now if you didn't need that extra stuff, then you could have a significant savings benefit.
Thanks for the interesting comment, I'd tip you if I had coins.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:13:57
Can you clarify for me, does SD pay transaction fees? Are they simply not high enough?
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:49:29


The person above you said: 


Basically when you pay bank fees, part of that is to offset fraud. You're paying for insurance. When the bank loans money out and pays you less in interest, that's also insurance. The banks don't magic money out of nowhere, being "big enough" doesn't magically make money. That assurance comes from the profit they make off of your money.
On average the banks are making more money off of users than the amount they waive for fraud. Collectively the users are paying for that insurance. Whether they're being "screwed" is up for you to decide.

What kind of risks are there? Could they accidentally setup a pool and point it at a stupid address and simply be dumping money into a black hole or accidentally pay someone else?
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:20:09
If you assume that the global hash rate always continuously ries, then the difficulty will always lag the actual hash rate, because difficulty jumps in step like schedule while the hash rate goes up continuously. So with that assumption, the minute after the difficulty is adjusted, the hash rate will increase a bit and will be slightly ahead of schedule.
Determining how far ahead of schedule depends on how fast the rate of hashing increases.

Actually, the merchant still passes some of the cost to you. They don't just do it explicitly. 
The merchant has some cost benefits from not having to deal with cash, but then the rest of the fees take the form of increased prices which are paid by all customers including cash-users as you've alluded to.

It's backed by usefulness. People will trade money for it in order to utilize the useful functions.
It's very hard to counterfeit. With current technology, it is highly improbably that anyone can counterfeit.
It can securely be sent across the Internet and thus around the world for very low cost.
It is very divisible meaning you can send very small bits of it for relatively low cost.
*These above properties are useful for a currency to have. Below properties are useful for certain economic functions.*
It is not controlled by any central authority (some consider this bad, but most people here consider it good)
It follows a predictable mining schedule that is not affected by random things like industrial usage or jewelry. 
It provides pseudo anonymity.

Right. So all nodes (Note: miners can be nodes too, but not all nodes are miners) get the first word by accepting and relaying transactions. Then the miners get the veto power you mentioned by being able to choose which transactions go into which block.
I'm wondering, do the nodes get a final say by getting to choose whether the block is included in the blockchain? Do nodes accept and relay blocks too?
Hypothetically: If consensus of the nodes was that after Block  we only accept blocks generated with this new POW, then miners which do not switch would have their blocks orphaned by the consensus nodes.
