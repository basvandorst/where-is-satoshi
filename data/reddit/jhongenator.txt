I'm not sure if the margin is enough to matter, but eliminating chargeback risk and payment fraud creates the ability for pricing to drop 2-5%, and in industries where payment fraud is high, eliminating financial risk could be a big deal.

If we ever want Bitcoin to take off, it has to reach the people who have no clue what Rasberry Pi even is, let alone think it is quite easy to set one up. From the layperson's perspective, cold storage is a lot more work, and it's also harder to use the coins (compared to an online wallet).  If you prefer to maintain control over your private keys that is completely cool, I am not actually arguing against cold storage as much as making a statement that there is a ease/convenience tradeoff. For large amounts or for the tech savvy/most-security-minded, it is the right choice.

Good question. I'm upvoting your comment in hopes that the Bitgo people can answer it (presuming they see my email asking them to come to this thread :) )

hahaha yea, good times :)

What I said is that Bitgo uses P2SH to accomplish what they are doing.. I don't think I ever imply that this is the point of P2SH or that this is what P2SH is.. In fact I think I say that Bitgo repurposed P2SH to do this.

That is my understanding.. When you create the account on Bitgo, when your browser creates keys 2 and 3, it actually suggests you print them out then and there. I poked around a bit, i think it actually clears caches for you right after that step, but I'm not positive.. If Bitgo goes down, you can still get to your coins using those keys (according to their website)

I don't but know people who do. Much simpler/faster than wire transfer.

I'm pretty sure your computer does not hold key2 either actually.. I think your computer creates key2, then uses a password you type into the browser to encrypt key2, and that is stored on Bitgo's servers.. whenever you need to use key2, Bitgo sends it back to your browser on demand, you type your password into the browser, and the browser now has key2 again, which it can use to sign the transaction. This all being said, the fact that the browser EVER has key2 probably means malware can get to it. Hopefully the Bitgo people can respond to this question.
I agree with what you say though, anything moving Bitcoin forward is I think a good thing, even if it's not perfect (yet).

ah, duh, of course.. thanks for that. I will edit my post!

It's actually not my service, I was just writing it up because I recently learned about it while trying to figure out how to store my own.  Here is the whitepaper Bitgo wrote about what they are doing: 
I could write what I think would be their answers to your questions, but I don't want to get it wrong, so I'm going to email their support and see if they can answer themselves.
