Yes right now they are. Certainly for bitcoin. Ease of use is an issue across all cryptocurrencies though.

I consider myself very technical and internet savvy. But getting into crypto was very frustrating. The info is just not there and it took me a few weeks to have full enough knowledge to answer my own initial questions. It shouldn't be that hard when you are determined to find the answers. The community has a problem of explaining things in technical terms far too much. 
Basically what I'm saying is it's not just a generational problem.

All exchanges offer multiple choices for viewing exchange rate from the major global currencies. The default reference is almost always based on location. In Japan it would be JPY. Your previous comment is false. There is no base currency. Exchange rates don't work like that. They are all tied to each other in the global market.

Yes they would charge higher fees if there is no competition. But competition will bring down fees. More banks involved means more competition. The banks will compete to undercut each other to capture majority customers.
Coinbase doesn't have enough competition right now so they can get away with high fees for the time being. This should change when you get greater choice of easy to use reputable exchanges. Banks getting involved is the start of that.

Hilariously ironic quote aside. Main stream adoption will be a pipe dream until ease of use is improved. The hoops and research you have to do to get a wallet and understand it is not user friendly to the average person.

They can't change the decentralised nature of crypto. A bank will actually have the resources to properly handle the market without going into maintenance every 5 minutes. Current and future exchanges are all in it for the same reason - profit. So a bank doing it isn't really any more or less evil. Plus it might inspire more big banks to follow which will provide better competition amongst exchanges.

Please can you paragraph your comments.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:16:31
Well obviously that is true. But cryptocurrency as a whole is totally anti user friendly. Ease of use is essential. Just like viability is essential.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:29:22
If you believe bitcoin will be a mainstream store of wealth or trading currency in the future. In both cases it is undervalued. The market cap would have to be much greater to accommodate that. Obviously that depends on if you believe it will succeed or if another coin will take its place.

Difference is people weren't creating thousands of houses out of thin air. And if they were they would still have value as a place to live. Most of these alt coins will eventually inevitably fail. There is only so much space in an open market.

Whats with the inconsistent ratios. EUR/USD then USD/JPY. As an accountant this infuriates me. The lack of XBT/USD notation is just the icing on the cake.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:26:08
I'm sure they were. Doesn't invalidate my criticism though. Part of the issue right now is lack of clear succinct information for the layman. I realise wallets and the technology will improve over time, hopefully with ease of use in mind. Information is a more present issue.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:25:11
Yeah but knowing what to get and why is information that is hard to find. And all the wallets are shit as far as ui and ease of use goes. I expect that will evolve over time though.

That's a poor metaphor. Training and research are not the same thing. There is a big difference when there is plenty of clear information available and professional instructors. Ironically a centralised source of information would be quite beneficial in improving this situation regarding crypto.

Tracking and regulating one entry point is not centralisation. There is still no printing of more crypto for inflation and there is no third party to transact for you. Once you have your crypto you can move it wherever and however you like within the decentralised network.

Not really. If the only thing you need that is a financial barrier is a house then it makes sense to cut risk and cash out when you can. Some people want a house sooner rather than later. 
I'd like to move out of my parents place and own my own home before I hit 30. After I have house I won't really be desperate for money so smaller investments is perfectly fine by me.
Plus a house is a worthwhile asset.

National currency wont go away. But BTC will become relatively stable. So you would probably convert a portion of your salary to BTC every month (or receive in BTC directly after taxes). And then use that for direct purchasing of private goods.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:00:31
All of that is affordable though. I have a decent job. I just can't borrow enough to get on the market even though I can definitely afford an expensive mortgage + other costs. I would need at least a 50% deposit just to buy the cheapest house in my area. And that would be a £125k deposit. That's a difficult amount to reach in a short period. 
And here in the UK rent is significantly more expensive than a mortgage. Which is why many people are trapped renting.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:49:02
Here in the UK renting is a lot more expensive than a mortgage. Renting is also more than 70% take home pay for a lot of people with average salaries. Which means it's almost impossible to save for a lot of people. This is why I still live with my parents at 26. So I can actually make meaningful savings. It's also why I lot of people are moving back in with the parents.
It's depressing if you want to become fully independent. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:14:03
Because dumping your house savings into BTC is incredibly risky. If it does crash you have lost everything. Hodling on for more than you need is greedy and just tempting fate. Its good to have the common sense to ignore greed and cash out as soon as you can afford what you were aiming for. Once you have that life goal and you are no longer in a financially risky position sure go ahead and risk more. But before that... Nope its not worth it.
And obviously a house is a hugely important life investment. Its a very safe asset as well (even if the housing market crashes you still have a home AND it will recover). Before bitcoin came along house prices was one of the most rapidly rising assets.

While your intention is noble. The reality is that sometimes race/religion/nationality is a factor and should not be ignored. But the current climate is to ignore it unless there is indisputable evidence for fear of being accused of racial profiling. Which unfortunately leads to them getting away with these horrendous crimes for far too long. It genuinely has an impact on the effectiveness of criminal investigations.
And ironically even pointing that out ends up getting you labelled racist. Which means a lot of people don't speak up and the issue continues. Political correctness gone too far and the current atmosphere to avoid offending everyone is a massive hindrance to progress in many areas.

"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had warned that penalties would be applied to SWIFT". 
How would they do that? You cut SWIFT off and they cut you off. Good luck with international payments. Governments only have power because they have the banking system in their pocket. If they make enemies of the banking system as well... I have no idea how things would turn out...

When they say electrical equipment it's usually cheap/faulty appliances like kettles. If the fuse fails you are screwed. Computer equipment is generally a lot safer and is much less likely to start a fire.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:38:41
No sorry. I thought it was fairly common knowledge. All electric fire news stories I've heard have always been faulty old appliances.
Fuses are safety components to prevent excess current passing through an electric device. They break when too much current passes through and this cuts the power. Which in turn should avoid an electrical fire. Computer components generally have a lot of high quality fuses. Whereas small appliances like kettles only have 1 or a few. So if they are cheaply made they could easily fail.
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:17:08
I'm sorry but it sounds like you don't understand finance. A change in monetary systems will have limited effect on finance. It will change business though. But only in regards to cashflow. Which is a tiny part of finance.
The only jobs at risk are banks or just certain positions within banks. Depending on how banking evolves and adapts. Finance professionals will never disappear. Not until every office job is completely automated by AI at least.
Finance professionals =/= bankers.

No the third party resellers are making boatloads. Nvidia is only profiting by selling stock immediately. And the margin on gpu's is tiny. Plus with memory prices out of whack they even had to increase MSRP to retain their tiny margin.
Nvidia could increase production to meet demand. But that is a big risk. If altcoin mining collapses they make huge loss. Gamers have loyalty and will always come back for another card every few years. So matching production to that is the wisest and most cautious approach if you don't want to take a gamble.

How? If they were going to convert 100% net income anyway then it makes no sense to buy on regular schedule. If you can't decide/commit to buy then you probably shouldn't be investing that much in the first place.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:21:29
Yes exactly. That's just the reverse situation of my example. You wouldn't take out a loan in something stupid as that though.
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:57:55
Wtf is your definition of decent?
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:16:25
I was just giving an example. There could be multiple cryptocurrencies. The point is if crypto becomes mainstream enough to take out loans with then the fiat value will be unimportant for the most part. As almost everything you buy will be bought with btc/crypto rather than fiat. That doesn't necessarily mean fiat and national currencies will disappear. I don't believe that will ever happen. It just means the fiat value is much less important to the majority of people. I do believe nations will create their own cryptocurrencies though. This is all speculation though. I'm just giving a speculative example of what could occur.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:30:25
More like his fiscal policy has failed.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:21:54
Even bad timing is arguably better than schedule. Unless you are very lucky.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:07:33
You are missing the point. You would take out the loan in the mainstream currency that you use. Its relative value to other currencies is not important since you do not use those other currencies. Are you concerned with the value of your current assets relative to the Zimbabwean dollar? No. Because that value is meaningless to your usage of your assets.
Plus in the example I'm giving. The assumption is the economy is mostly crypto driven. Which means all major currencies should be reasonably stable relative to each other. Assuming they are all deflationary.
You do have a point if the deflation was happening at a very fast rate. To the point where physical assets (or your examples) you buy with btc are worth a radically different price in btc in the time you pay of the loan. However that volatility should be gone by the time it becomes mainstream and usable as a loan currency. Volatility and rapid revaluation should disappear once mainstream adoption has been complete.
Also a key point is loaning a deflationary currency means you don't need to charge interest. Because the increased value could potentially be in line with interest. You could even model crypto loans to have negative interest to combat a faster rate of deflation. So the problem is solvable if it were to occur.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:37:20
While you are correct the initial question was about paid wallets. I think people got a bit off track.
To fund a development team you need funds. One way to do that is paid wallets. Without that it's unlikely to be guaranteed support and updates. Which is a no go for businesses.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:27:17
I presume a dedicated development team that will continually provide updates, patches and improvements. Also better support.
Businesses will always go for suppliers that provide better service and software support even if there are much cheaper solutions.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:06:36
You are missing a key point though. Your 10btc is 10btc. Its fiat value is irrelevant. When crypto is mainstream enough for us to take out loans in btc, its fiat value is completely irrelevant. When btc is truly mainstream we wont be talking about its relative value like we are now. And yes it will be deflationary. But at that point it should be quite stable and slow to deflate. So prices in btc will be fairly accurate without risk of volatility like they are now.
And crypto loans could also potentially be done on the decentralised network as well.

You are still confusing money management with finance. Management accounting, financial accounting, tax advice, system accounting, consultancy etc etc should all still be perfectly fine. Blockchain can automate only some aspects of those roles. We are trying to get more automation at my work because it will free up time to deal with other non processing financial issues. This technology will change things but I can't see any financial professionals being concerned.  We can benefit massively from the change. Either by improved efficiency or by getting into financial consulting regarding crypto.

Damages usually cover future losses as a direct result. Also would make no sense since the criminal can profit even after punishment. That bitcoin isn't his so he must pay at current value. Returning it would be the same. He probably sold it though so can't.

The reason banks are able to refund stolen money is the governments can just print more. That systems has its flaws. And its really starting to show.
It's possible we will be able to find a solution to security with bitcoin. Its still early days. If there was some kind of consensus to allow reversal of illegal transactions then we may have solution. But i have no idea how we would go about that without centralising control, I'm not a developer.
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:24:47
Your company has to buy the BTC to pay you in it. Its just changing who does the exchange. It removes choice of when to buy. Which means you may lose out on dips and buy on peaks.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:49:59
Financial professionals are not bankers and insurance brokers, but bankers and insurance brokers are part of the financial industry (Not sure if i'm explaining this properly but accountants, financial advisors and auditors are main financial roles. Most don't really consider banking, etc in the same light). The science of money management is different to actual physical money management. Yes financial professionals do take part in physical money management to varying degrees. But what that wiki extract is referring to is management in the form of cost allocation and reporting. That's completely different to what banks, insurance companies and loan companies do.

I think you are misusing the terms centralised/decentralised.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:06:13
I get what you are saying but let's be objective here. 
Most coins have no value as a currency right now. It's too early. Bcash is no different in that regard.
And a minority of nodes doesn't mean it's centralised. It just means it's less secure. It's based on bitcoin, it's still decentralised.
Obviously the people backing it and misleading others is a major issue. But that's different.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:56:51

@_date: 2018-02-19 00:33:06
The reason any money can be given as security is because it is backed up by the governments. It is backed up by printing more. Why do you think the world runs on debt? There is trillions of dollars underground in criminal organisations. The books cannot be balanced and that money cannot be retrieved. Which is why money printing and inflation occurs (In addition to redistributing wealth to government). Refunded irretrievable stolen money is covered by the government through your bank (at least in the UK). The money in your bank account is not money the bank is holding for you, it is debt they owe you. This is exactly why the current monetary system is so dangerous.
The global economy is supposed to be a zero sum game. You cant just refund stolen money without getting it from somewhere. But since its underground it has be replaced with printed money which results in devaluation.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:27:20
Yes just by selling 100% of production. Just like AMD. Neither are profiting from the price hikes by third party resellers. And they are losing loyal buyers in the form of gamers. Which is something they don't really want. They certainly are benefiting to a certain degree. But your initial comment is a complete misrepresentation of what is really happening.
The third party resellers who are buying all stock from official retailers at close to MSRP and flipping for 3 times the price are the ones making boatloads of cash and exploiting the market. Not the GPU manufacturers.

This isn't really surprising since Japan is pretty much a cash trading nation. And they already have systems like suica cards to avoid the inconvenience of physical cash.
