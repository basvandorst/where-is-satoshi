Your limits will increase after you do a few trades

I think this question has been answered a few times before but I can take a stab at why it's not a good idea.
1. Exchanges can be hacked both externally and internally. Someone else can walk away with your money.
2. An exchange can be shut down involuntarily due to govt regulation. You will lose your coins or at best have to deal with a nightmare scenario in restoring them.
3. An exchange like coinbase owns your account and thus the money in it. They can lock you out of your account same way PayPal could lock you out, for something that may not even be your fault . Just have a look at the number of locked accounts on the coinbase subreddit.
So bottom line you want to be in complete control of your money , and ideally keep it offline especially if you're not a day trader type.

This is one of the rare situations where you may be better of buying via coinbase directly instead of waiting for your deposit to arrive in gdax. The reason is because while you pay a fee to coinbase but you will lock in the current low exchange rate, alternative being you wait for the gdax deposit by which time the rate on bitcoin may have gone up a lot

There's fresh news about major Indian banks banning crypto related activity looks like that may be the reason

Yes I'm sure that's their business model. However the price is still much cheaper than what I would pay at Coinbase. For example if the current avg Bitcoin price on coinmarketcap is $3800, Coinbase buy price would be somewhere around 3900 whereas Robinhood would be around $3810 or so. Not to mention Coinbase rip me off with a separate transaction fee as well.

Is the deposit to USD wallet in coinbase instant? If so then I'll give that a try and transfer to gdax via coinbase

Use Robinhood crypto. Deposit and buy instantly with $0 fee. The only downside is that it does not allow coin withdrawal at the moment.

Ok tell me how does one buy instantly via gdax? Short answer you can't.  Expecting someone to have cash handy within gdax is not realistic. People have to first transfer funds over to gdax which takes a good 3-5 business days

Maybe he's concerned about the cost basis for tax purposes
