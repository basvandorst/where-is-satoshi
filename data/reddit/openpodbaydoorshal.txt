Bitcoin is a good "bearer" asset. To own a registered asset (like a stock or bond or colored coin) however, nearly every jurisdiction says you have to know who certifies the validity of the ledger it sits on. If it's an anonymous guy in a cave in China...tough to enforce in the courts that it is a valid asset. That's why people are setting up private ledgers

Coinbase needs to re-read the regs, there's something called the "travel rule" that says that banks must track the source and destination of transfers, not just where it came from but the person who sent it to the source transaction, i.e., if ISIS sends John Smith money from Bank X and John Smith sends it from Bank Y to Bank Z, Bank Z must track that it originally came from Bank X.
That's how it works, folks.

Like I said above, tokens on such a chain are good bearer assets. I can't think of a jurisdiction (in the G-20 at least) however that will say that a ledger verified by unknowable anonymous actors is valid, especially actors that have no contractual obligations to the holders of the ledger assets. Maybe a new legal structure will be created but one does not exist today. "Bearer" possession ownership is one thing: I own this car, I hold this bar of gold. As soon as you own a contractual obligation of some kind things change enormously.

It's so emblematic of precisely what's wrong with America, sheeple blindly believing "experts" and "leaders" without thinking for themselves.  They get led into useless wars that consume trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives like Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. They acquiesce in the War on Drugs, another multi-trillion dollar waste. They mindlessly believe the "experts" who debase their money and destroy their purchasing power and standard of living. Real household wealth has *declined* despite the biggest orgy of debt in history, that must be repaid by their children and grandchildren, with no positive effect on real national wealth, and this continues because "experts", so obviously wrong, continue their failed policies which only benefit the 0.1%, their sole constituency.

Wrong conclusion. The foreign currency market is by far the largest market in the world and operates smoothly with little corruption, with no SEC, no FINRA, no CFTC to raise costs and protect incumbents. There is no reason in the world for Bitcoin to be anything but just another currency, to be regulated exactly like the Euro or the Yen. So yes, Team Lawsky should go home in the case of Bitcoin. What he wants is to justify his existence with another bureaucratic office and fee and procedure that has no practical benefit to the market or its participants.

Each of your attempts relies on thinner and thinner premises and so fails. Even when your results are absurd "war with Iraq was a good idea at the time and now is not" (even though the situation is identical, it's the same country with the same people and the same tribal rivalries) you refuse to see the obvious flaw in your logical short circuit. Imagining that "experts" are not completely captured by their biases is blind. Positing that they must be smarter than observable empirical facts (there is a car coming right now) is asinine. It's a nice construct you've made for yourself, imagining a world where independent thought is no longer useful, that would make life simple, indeed. But it must be frustrating to be wrong so often and be unable to do anything about it. I sincerely hope you're not called upon to cross streets, invest money, consume food, or do anything which requires thought.
@_date: 2014-06-25 09:46:19
Your premise falls apart at the slightest touch: "...due to the average expert by nature having more knowledge and being smarter..." Um according to whom precisely? Oh, look, nobody. You have asserted this to be somehow a true statement but have provided exactly zero supporting evidence, because there is none. Yet you persist in maintaining this is somehow a better strategy than simple observation and critical thought. You completely ignore the possibility that so-called "experts" very often drive their own agendas, usually those of their employers, and this leads them to be highly unreliable sources. By contrast, scanning the road in both directions or a nano-second of thought on a preference for paying more or less for something would return a much better result. "Experts" are not smarter or better guides to decision making, and your asserting they are does not make it magically so. You argue that it was somehow rational to listen to experts on invading Iraq, and now it is somehow also rational to keep listening to them. Your system crashes to the ground of its own ridiculous weight.

"bank debt money" is simply the term used for the money creation system we currently have. Money (except cash) is solely created as bank debt.
Maybe you want to read this on deflation and inflation. It's not the fact of fractional reserve that creates it, it's the quantity that is created versus the underlying economic activity. Fractional reserve in itself is not the culprit, but rather the central bank policies creating too much bank debt money for a given amount of underlying economic activity at that point in time.
We need a system where credit creation is separated from the money system. Gold works like that, so does Bitcoin. The OP's point is that Bitcoin will never really fit into existing regulatory regimes.

some very light rules about requiring Eligible Contract Participants, basically punting until further regs come out, nothing like SEC paperwork avalanches for stocks, bonds etc. Those rules are to regulate broker dealers, not to regulate the currencies themselves. Similarly, sure they can regulate the ETF, that's not the same as regulating Bitcoin. Ditto commodities, the CFTC geniuses do such a great job regulating commodities (MFG, silver, gold, aluminum) I am SURE we do not want them anywhere near Bitcoin. In sum: sure, if there are vehicles that use Bitcoin (ETFs, broker dealers, futures) they should be regulated but NOT the thing itself. It should be "regulated" just like a euro or yen is.

It's like a balloon animal, you think you're making risk go away but you twist and the tail just gets bigger.

That would be against the abundant evidence however (coups, drones, invasions, spying, banker free passes) that they do not. So it's actually quite easy to imagine Mircea being rendered to a black site, waterboarded, and then disappeared. Look in the mirror, America, for that's what you've become: the lawless apex bully of the world.
In alt-world, you could imagine that Mircea would just need to comply with the laws on the books and he should have no fear whatsoever. There are no laws on the books that forbid what he's doing.

I love the counter-intuitive and counter-factual “inflation/deflation” debate. Yes, sure…I want to be able to buy less goods with my money when I go to the store. Oh, yes, please!
I guess it depends if you think money is wealth. If so then hey! Print away, we’ll all be billionaires! I happen to think goods and services are wealth, and money represents them. Printing more money to represent the same quantity of goods and services means…that each unit of money is now representing LESS goods and services. Unfortunately you have NOT succeeded in magically “creating wealth”. So enjoy your nice inflated currency as your STANDARD OF LIVING GOES DOWN. Is it that you just like seeing a higher number of them in your account? Dow 30,000 anyone?

they want it to be SWIFT, a single global ledger for all trades. Problem is banks make 40% of their earnings from payments and 25% from forex globally, asking them to give that up is not gonna happen. They might use Ripple for internal purposes (and are already). Would be interesting to see figures on Ripple volumes, not just XRP volumes, I'm sure plenty of banks have been given tons of free XRP so they will try it out so those would not show up as XRP purchases. All I know is their marketing states you can trade USD and CNY etc, but you can do no such thing.

Several Americans expressed mild annoyance today at the creation of a new government agency empowered to monitor their air usage.  "Too many Americans are using air they do not need by inhaling incorrectly" said Perd Furvis, who will run the new Department of Air Enforcement, "and our data also shows that so-called "sleeper" terror cells may be using air as they prepare their next attacks". The new agency, which will share combat capabilities and training with the Department of Homeland Security, will install "Air Usage Monitors" in all homes by 2016. By early 2017 the new department hopes to have a nationwide "Air Licensing" system in production. "People don't realize how critical air is to our national security, so it's important we regulate it's use by individuals. Excess breathing may also serve as an "early warning system" of an imminent attack". Citizens found to be using air incorrectly would be subject to fines or imprisonment. "Given the importance of air to our whole economy,' added Furvis, "we'll be pushing for air abuse to be listed as a capital crime. You can never be too careful". 
In other news, the State Department announced a new all-time high in Americans renouncing their citizenship and leaving the country...

Lawsky is an absolutely terrible risk manager, all he needs to do is go down to the lobby of his building, cross the street in any direction, and he will find financial crimes in progress, hundreds of times larger than Bitcoin, with the perps sitting right there at their desks waiting for their bonus checks.

This has passed into the realm of the utterly absurd. Your advice is to cross the street with my eyes closed just because someone who calls himself an "expert" insists that has the highest probability of success. It's like listening to anything coming out of Dick Cheney's mouth today about the Iraq War. I'm sure you're quite pleased with the outcome there, because the "experts" were unanimous that it would all be great and I'm sure you're glad they were listened to. The 10 million people protesting in the streets prior to that war felt otherwise, oh, look, they were 100% correct and yet again the "experts" were 100% wrong. Not probably wrong, or statistically wrong, just dead wrong. That's good enough for me. You have yet to show any evidence whatsoever of so-called "experts" being statistically "more correct" than a reasonably-informed general public. Someday you will realize with regret that paying more for things does not make you wealthier. That concept would seem to be quite easy to grasp, but apparently not for everyone.

NEWSFLASH: In a spontaneous awakening, Americans suddenly remembered that their country was founded on the concept of freedom from tyranny. Although their government had grown more and more intrusive, and their privacy and civil liberties had declined sharply in recent years, Americans were largely passive. Then, something happened: a minor regulator in one state completely overstepped the bounds of reasonableness by attempting to impose regulations on new internet currencies that affected the entire world. The uprising, now known as "The November Days of Rage", culminated in the peaceful overthrow of the government. The first act by the decentralized, consensus-driven replacement government was to overturn all regulations related to money and its transmission. "We believe in the free market" said the consensus statement, "and we are confident that the free market can supply the best quality kinds of money and money services that people require. Although there will be disruption as bad types of money and money services close down, we think the damage will not be nearly as great as the old monetary system that was unfair, unresponsive, and run solely for the benefit of a tiny minority".

2 things about volatility this guy doesn't get:
1. any thinly-traded asset can be very volatile;
2. the only reason every other market has no volatility is that central banks are smashing the vol out. Ask the forex, stock, and bond trading desks of any bank
So number 1 will solve itself (without dumb USD front ends like Circle), and number 2 is a sign of a (relatively) free market.

@_date: 2014-12-15 04:23:31
Agree. But a digital currency where the dealing and usage environment was controlled so it was not subject to leveraged speculation addresses this. The key is to stand up institutions we can trust to do so, and that's in progress. They also have the advantage of controlling privacy. Only a signed court order for a specific individual in a valid jurisdiction need be honored. With the channel encrypted end-to-end it also has much less chance of being penetrated by alphabet soup agencies.

Not accurate, you are mixing money and credit, understandably so given our current debt-based money system. It does not have to be that way however. Certainly lending can happen using Bitcoins as the collateral. The question is whether to allow more lending than existing underlying collateral and thereby expand the money supply. I happen to believe that the money supply and the supply of existing credit need to be kept separate. That way the money can play the role of retaining its value (purchasing power) and the supply of credit can be regulated by market forces (bank credit quality, underwriting standards, loan book quality etc). By mixing the two we get banking crises that are also monetary crises, they should be two different things. I assume you've seen the charts of the USD purchasing power since 1913?

You sir have no clue. I am sorry you have been successfully brainwashed. Inflation is only good for banks and their best clients, governments. Given a choice, when you go to a store, would you prefer A. your money buys the same amount of goods as last time, or B it buys less. Put on your thinking cap now and select A or B.
Governments and banks want inflation because it's a way they can borrow and spend more without raising taxes. That's because inflation IS a stealth tax. 2% inflation means after 10 years you have 25% less purchasing power. Since we have NO wage inflation...why would ANYONE want THAT?

You may as well call it "The Dystopian Future", it really does not have much to do with Bitcoin, it has to do with fiat money and the giant lab rat experiment central bankers are conducting. The sooner we confront why that is, the better. 
Here's a thought experiment for you. The system came apart due to excess housing debt. Had the Fed handed money to mortgage holders (instead of banks) then each and every household in the US would have received a check for $1124 *per month* for the last five years. The economic boom we would be having would be incredible...and the banks would be healthy as a result. That was the original plan for TARP...until they changed it 10 days later and gave the money to AIG and Goldman. Now ask yourself: why would they want to just enrich billionaires (and leave the banking system still shaky on life support) instead of fostering a Main St economic Renaissance?

We need to fight the "inflation is good" myth wherever we can. It's so embedded, it's like the priests in Galileo's day insisting the Earth is the center of the universe. Let's see, when I go to the store, I would prefer A. I get the same amount for my money as I got yesterday, or B. I get less. Especially when prices are inflating but wages are not. "But oh oh people will delay their purchases". I guess then companies everywhere from Walmart to Amazon who are trying to make their goods cheaper should just stop, it will kill the demand for them. OK let's raise prices so people will buy more....um, no.
The main ones by far who benefit from inflation are bankers (who can sell more debt) and governments (who can spend more money without visibly raising taxes). STOP!

It's all a very interesting and contrived system, and demonstrably leads to the wrong conclusions. Thank goodness the world does not operate according to such a silly set of artificial constructs. By the way, inflation does not lead to more wealth, your "experts" asserting it will does not just magically make it so. It's a shame so many need to learn that lesson, repeated so many times throughout history with identical results each time. I'm sorry you do not have enough confidence in your own powers of thought and observation to understand why.

These points either do not matter or are being solved. Volatility? that will change dramatically as it grows, right now it's just very thinly-traded. Set the date for 2014, click the tab for euro and oil and you'll see it's more volatile than the euro but less volatile than oil. 
Hoarding? This is just part of the inflation/deflation myth that bankers love. Here's a quick question: when you go to the store, do you prefer A. that your money buys the same as it bought yesterday, or B. you prefer your money would buy LESS. And if lower prices somehow means people stop buying things, then why do Walmart and Amazon work as hard as they can to offer lower prices? They should just be raising their prices, or else they will "kill" demand. The only ones who want inflation are bankers (so they can sell more of their product = debt) and their best customers, governments, so they can spend more without raising taxes. Without inflation, and with rising technology and productivity, guess what: your standard of living goes UP.
Ok: Shady exchanges. Yep, no question. There are still not many/any good places to buy Bitcoin, but that is changing fast. And hardware wallets will be a big step forward in security.
Ok: Complexity. Also Yes. Getting easier though. Try out Kryptokit. There are dozens of other apps that are in the works to manage/hide the complexity. If you're trying to explain Bitcoin, just try this: it's person-to-person global money with no middleman.

LOL I have refuted your argument every step of the way, have you even read this response? "It would have been the rational choice to do everything that got them there". In your alternate universe the smarter choice would lead to living in a cave. I guess black sometimes IS white. Case closed.
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:18:10
It's semantics and pedantry. The rational choice is for an individual to use their own faculties and powers of observation to draw obvious conclusions about the world around them. Oh, look, there's a car coming. Oh, look, I now have less money in my account. Bizarre systems that obfuscate this simple truth are just abdications of responsibility. Mass hysterias based on "experts" who bring their own agendas (if you're not a Keynesian economist it's much less likely you will receive university tenure or attract industry grants) are the unfortunate result of individuals abdicating these rational thought responsibilities. Do you also not believe in evolution? As there seem to be plenty of "experts" in the US who think it is invalid, they're succeeding in getting other "theories" taught in US schools, to the complete amazement of every other developed country.
Perhaps if Americans stopped abdicating their powers of reasoning the world would not have to suffer more American fantasy wars and more American fantasy finance. My sense is that the priests are starting to lose their grip: Iraq of course is going so well, and Q1 GDP shrank by $75 billion despite $250 billion in free money being showered down. Even the Fed priests, standing at the curb, can see that truck barreling towards them, pity you cannot.

Agree, nice to have a civil discussion about these important issues.
I also believe that there is an optimal solution that includes BTC, Ripple, and fiat (what I refer to as "bank money"). My main problem with XRP as part of this scheme is that the Ripple people don't seem to realize they are running a central bank as well as a payment system. There is a reason that investors hang on every syllable uttered by Bernanke (and now Yellen). The Ripple float, by contrast, may change in size by a factor of ten with no warning and according to no schedule. The recent kerfuffle with the founders showed just how unknown the supply situation is. So you really need to rule it out as even a temporary store of value.
I find myself wondering about a large corp's internal transfer pricing needs. Seems to me BTC is well-suited to these. Right now with worldwide competitive debasement you might understand why a Treasurer of one of these orgs might be saying "just give me something that won't go down today". BTC is too volatile for that just yet...but perhaps not for long.

you're strangely angry, suggest you get some meds or something. Regulation always lags way behind technology and governments are going to have to adjust.

This is an unbelievable effort.

I think your problems will be *political*, unfortunately. First you'll need to gain technical acceptance and improve where needed. Then you'll need to build a consensus that these changes must happen, I hope it won't require a near-death experience for that to happen. Maybe the core devs can take their heads out for a change, stop worrying about things like putting Bitcoin into satellites, and take the time to build a consensus and a plan around the ideas contained here.

Yes but people would know the difference between a Bitcoin and a loan (an instrument issued by an entity other than the blockchain).

My other bitch about Ripple is that they seem to be clueless that they are running a central bank (for XRP). There's a reason investors hang on every last syllable uttered by Janet Yellen.

Occam's Razor, my friend. The 6% still exists because they can get away with it, the Fed exists for the benefit of the banking system and its owners, NOT for the benefit of the citizenry. That's not its purpose or charter. Riddle me this: had the Fed handed the money from various QE programs to actual people instead of to banks (as was the original plan until Hank Paulson changed it), then every household in the US would have received a check for $942 *per month* for the last five years. The economic boom would be huge, underwater homeowners would be paying down their mortgages, and the banks would be healthier than they are. Why did they not do that?

Your core premise is false, that's why your "reasoning" keeps ending up at the wrong destination. I would suggest you unplug from the dangerous notion that people should not think for themselves. We are called homo *sapiens* for a reason, and abdicating our cognitive powers to priests, experts, politicians, TV announcers, rap artists, shamans, whatever, is completely silly. When the light turns green, it's a much better idea to look both ways and then proceed, the light is just an interesting opinion as to the safe time to cross the road. Your central idea that somehow your own brain cannot possibly comprehend this basic subject (A or B inflation choice), and instead you should rely on other people (ignoring whether they may have a completely different set of self-interests in determining their opinions than you do) is just a cognitive short circuit. Take wire A, untangle it from wire B, it will stop sending out sparks, and shortly some clarity will return. You'll enjoy the feeling! The simple observation that having your money slowly be worth less and less is a much worse outcome for you personally than having it maintain its value will finally dawn. Do not be swayed by examples like the 1970's where we had wage inflation at the same time (which we clearly do not have now). Let's see, wages steady or declining, costs rising, I am A. better off, or B. worse off. Pick one. Good luck!

You believe experts are more likely to be right than your own reasoning facilities. I challenge that core premise as demonstrably false with practically unlimited examples. Since evidence is very easy to come by (has inflation ever increased a nation's real wealth? Is receiving less for your money ever a better outcome?), and since there is a high probability that "experts" have different goals and desired outcomes than you do, I believe your abdicating your thought processes to others is stupid. I guess we need to leave it there.

No: This is a terrible idea. If you want to reduce crime you should start by "redlisting" dollar bills as they are far and away used for more crime than Bitcoin. They have serial numbers and this can be easily done: any merchant receiving a redlisted bill must confiscate it immediately. Once you've tried this you will realize it will instantly destroy the currency. If that is also your intention with Bitcoin, just come out and say it next time.

Look! There's a cliff! And everybody's jumping! Oh I better jump too!
You think this is a rational way to make decisions. I do not. I, not you, am "seated at the table of reason". You, by contrast, have decided that reason is not important, what's important is what a majority of people are doing or thinking. That premise has been disproven time and again throughout history; indeed one could argue that it IS history. The consensus of experts at the time told Columbus he would obviously sail off the edge of the world. Lighter than air flight is impossible. Those shuttle O-rings will not be a problem. People will never need a computer in their homes.
Do a little more homework next time. Ask yourself, for example, why the entire economics profession is engaged in fundamental soul searching right now because 98% of their models completely missed the 2008 financial crisis.
So instead of engaging in the tiniest little thought exercise to consider the arguments for and against an inflationary currency, you reject all arguments (hmm I wonder why) in favor of "the experts are always right" avoidance scheme. It's quite sad. I'd encourage you to open your mind, and think for yourself for a change. It's very rewarding.

Don't. Let's review the landscape: innovation in the Bitcoin protocol has apparently ground to a halt. Serious flaws in the protocol (mining centralization, blockchain size, etc.) threaten its future, and if governance is so political, underfunded, and slow, it may never be able to react. Certainly it's difficult to see how it can remain innovative in the current structure. As far as the Mises arguments, "network effect" is meaningless when you're talking about the scale of the opportunity and where we are on the curve, that's like saying Compuserve will inevitably rule the world. Mises argument  is also false: if it were true we would have one world currency today, not hundreds. Currencies thrive for many reasons: legal tender laws protecting monopolies, but also usefulness, availability, issuance mechanisms, fungibility, liquidity, trust, politics, etc. So: can an altcoin get up that rivals and even outpaces Bitcoin? Certainly.  I mean look how geeky and complicated Bitcoin is, one will come along that makes the UE really smooth, etc.etc.
@_date: 2014-06-26 09:38:45
Again, and again, and again, you repeat your unprovable premise. It's like asking whether the priests in Galileo's day were smarter than the people who figured out that the Earth was not the center of the universe. Like you, those priests made arguments that were ever more contrived since they were continuing to attempt to prove something with a false premise at its heart. I am sure those priests also graduated from some fine colleges. And given that the evidence required to make an observation about inflation is so readily available, and the preferences and economic consequences so simple to determine, it is the height of absurdity to believe it can be better observed by other people, especially other people whose livelihood uniformly depends on them arriving at a preset answer. You are the one ignoring arguments, not me.

Your ignorance is victorious, any system that compels people not to think for themselves would have left mankind in the Dark Ages. Only when people began to use their own brains, to think for themselves, and not to accept the received wisdom of priests and other "experts" did the knowledge of mankind advance. It's astounding to hear someone attempt to defend such a course today, and with so much artifice. It's really a case study in delusional logic feedback loops. I also believe it is a particularly American phenomenon, there's a reason that America is the only advanced country in the world where subjects like evolution are still being "debated". A large percentage of the population has decided not to think for themselves, and this explains a lot for me, and it's quite a sad statement. It reminds me of the state senator who said "Out demon Bitcoin!". Your brain is a wonderful instrument, can I suggest you develop the confidence and clarity to use it. Goodbye.

Bitcoin, like the internet itself, allows *innovation without permission*. If you want to "innovate" in the current payments infrastructure, you need permission from a whole raft of people: banks, Visa/MC. regulators, APRA, gateway providers, mobile network operators, etc etc etc. The Bitcoin network however, is entirely *open*: in order to transact, all you need is a valid keypair. The internet has seen a gigantic amount of innovation and disruption, precisely for this same reason...Bitcoin will be the same.

Step 1. Buy Bitcoins, you can do this by signing up to an exchange. You wire them money and then you can purchase Bitcoins, depending upon the current price. Step 2. transfer those Bitcoins to your employees. Each employee needs his or her own Bitcoin "wallet". This wallet has an "address". Simply enter each employee's address in the field marked "Withdrawals". Then select the number of Bitcoins you wish to send. The Bitcoins will automatically be sent to that address, usually takes between 10-30 minutes.

OMG if I need to walk people through the "deflation is bad" myth one more time I'm gonna puke.
Let's start with a question, which do you prefer: A. when you go to the store, your money buys the same quantity of goods as last time, or B. you prefer if your money buys less goods than last time?
If lower prices mean people buy less then why do companies like Amazon and Walmart work like the devil to offer the lowest prices they can? I mean why would they not raise their prices, since this theory somehow says people would buy more?
And it all depends if you think money equals wealth. If you do (Keynesian/inflationist) then by all means lets print up mountains of the stuff, we'll all be billionaires! If, however, you think goods and services equal wealth, and money just represents them, you would know that printing money faster than goods and services are growing just means you have more money per unit of goods. You have no magically created wealth, sorry, you've just added a meaningless zero to the end of your bank balance.

Bad men who control money do not want any competition. They told a man who works for the government to come up with rules Bitcoin must follow that no other form of money must follow. Those rules are so complicated and unworkable they would kill Bitcoin if they were enforced. Instead, Bitcoin companies are just refusing to serve anyone unlucky enough to live in New York where these rules will be enforced.

in the Bitcoin case tho the distinction between cash and a bank acct will be evident.
Also recall that the supply side of the equation is fixed so your statement "Demand for (hard) Bitcoins increases the interest rate for lending, keeping the supply low" wouldn't apply (unless you meant the lending "supply" was kept low?
I think the gold equivalent conversation is instructive. Currencies used to just be representations of gold in vaults. Only once unhinged from that did we get substantial inflation. Banks lending against the gold in their vaults didn't spur inflation.
Interesting debate, let's continue, very thought-provoking.

I did. He said Americans need more layers of regulation, we only have government performing 42% of all economic activity in the country, he wants to push for at least 75% or more. There are only 56 different regulatory agencies already involved with Bitcoin (50 states plus CFTC, FinCEN, SEC, DHS, and several more) and we can do better. "America is a free country" he continued "and we need to be sure we have every possible regulation in place to make sure it stays that way".
In separate news, it was revealed that falling televisions kill more people each year in America than terrorism. After a one year study, Washington will soon be announcing a new "Department of Audio-Visual Security". The new Department will share resources and training with DHS, including tanks, mortar launchers, and assault rifles to make sure Americans comply with the new rules. People found not adequately securing their entertainment devices will be subject to stiff fines or prison. "These crimes endanger many citizens each year" said Perd Furvis, the head of the new agency "and we intend to put a stop to it".

Good post Alex. Some of your reasoning for pursuing CV is valid; but the initial premise is not. That premise is that regulation will serve the community of users a useful purpose. Except for very limited cases that premise is false. As has been shown across every single financial product, regulation has been completely ineffective in producing a consumer protection result, since the regulatory mechanism is easily co-opted by corrupt incumbents for their own purposes. Whether it's stocks, mortgages, forex, muni bonds, gold, silver, or commodities, the sad history is of rampant fraud and crime and unprosecuted criminals. Banks do not commit crime, bankers do, and so long as we do not prosecute banking crime this will not change. Fines are a meaningless penalty imposed on bank shareholders.
The model for Bitcoin regulation should mirror the existing regulatory regime of foreign currencies. Light AML/KYC on account opening; then almost no regulation at all. Bitcoin should be viewed for regulatory and tax purposes just like a euro or a yen. There is no valid reason why Bitcoin should face additional regulation or scrutiny beyond what those currencies face.
Lawsky's rules might be a good step if they ONLY applied to exchanges. As they exist they are a transparent attempt to kill Bitcoin.
Regarding validation specifically, I suggest we channel our efforts to validating the US Dollar. With serial numbers this should be quite straightforward. When a merchant first confiscates that $20 you just paid him because it was used in a drug deal in 1998, you will then understand why CV would destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-22 22:51:43
Think harder: does Bitcoin need or want a dumb USD "front-end"? Do we want CoinValidation? Do we want regulation?
Bitcoin should be regulated just like the Euro: almost not at all. There is no reason to require special licenses or approvals that the Euro doesn't have. Allaire thinks otherwise.
We don't need Bitcoin pushed into the background with a dumb USD front end. We need employers paying in Bitcoin, and merchants receiving and keeping Bitcoin.

There are virtually no regs on currency trading, after ten years they finally put in some mild AML/KYC on account opening. There's no currency SEC, no currency FINRA.

Now we're getting somewhere. We should have restrictions on lending (look where excess lending gets us: repeated serial banking crises). I'm not imagining regulations to restrict lending, however, but rather market forces. Money separate from credit, remember. So entities can extend credit all they like, and investors will reward (or not) their skill at doing so: underwriting, marketing, servicing. No moral hazard backstopping by the issuer of the money required. Lenders come and go, there can be a gov't backstop entity for depositors but not for stock or bondholders. Bank stocks are just like every other stock, your money is at risk. But the money system itself is not. THAT is sound money, even with gold backing if there was fractional lending we did NOT try it as a system.

So your rule is "nobody is doing it today so banning it should be no problem". Oops that could mean all of Bitcoin too.
And no, products like Circle would clearly not be permitted under this stupid new law. Circle's Terms &amp; Conditions clearly state they buy hedges.
And in case you hadn't heard about it, the use of the blockchain to serve as an asset register for many types of financial products is a huge area of innovation. Oops, banned in Belgium. If precedent is an example, soon to be banned across the EU.
So again Belgium is providing a wonderful service, right alongside telling farmers in Poland what size turnips they are allowed to sell.

OMG deflation theorists would have you believe people will stop buying the stuff they need because they're afraid it will be cheaper next month.

Good discussion.
I think they should trust themselves as a counterparty, and do all of their internal accounting in Bitcoin.
If they worked with a Bitcoin exchange that used Ripple then they could minimize the Bitcoin exchange counterparty risk, send fiat via Ripple to the exchange, buy BTC, immediately transfer out. Not perfect but manageable. Decentralized BTC exchanges will help.
On your Ripple analogy, I thought a gateway had to have "trust lines" established before their iou would be "fungible" (so to speak, in other words viewable and tradeable with other Ripplers), is that not the case? 
Agree if/when major banks step into the Ripple gateway role then Ripple gets more plausible...but only if you think the major banks are (or deserve to be ) "creditworthy*. Their serial behavior, balance sheets, and hidden risks would argue otherwise. Then when you layer on the behavior of the issuer of the currency (USD etc) then the Bitcoin arguments get even louder.

OK good reply. Lots to discuss, let's start with Ripple. I'm generally in favor and open-minded but there are flaws. They market as "oh look you can send USD" when in fact that's far from the truth. You can exchange a "Ripple gateway IOU in USD", but only with others who agree to take that credit. Otherwise it completely lacks that fundamental thing for a currency: fungibility.
And on smart property, it's just a question of "who says so?" If someone you trust says that a certain colored Bitcoin is a share of Google, then it is. I would trust Google Treasury to make that assertion, or maybe a big bank (ugh), but certainly not Havelock or CryptoStocks. AppCoins, done right, would be another approach, but you'd want a legal blessing or framework covering it and so far I haven't seen one.

OK I was not aware of his stance on other issues. But anyone calling for the level of Bitcoin regs he is calling for is deeply misguided about the nature of money, regulations and financial freedom. Can I suggest he learn a bit more about financial markets; for example, he should know that the foreign currency market is A. by far the largest market in the world, and B. almost entirely unregulated. There is light KYC when you open an account and THAT'S ALL. No SEC, no FINRA, no CFTC, and certainly no make-work NY State bureaucrat saying people selling wallet software need to buy a license to do so.
I also oppose his approach to Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not need a dumbed down USD "front end", that is actually BAD for Bitcoin in the medium and long term. We need to move away from debt-based, violence-backed state currencies that concentrate power and wealth upwards. Sounds like Allaire should know that.

Sir Richard was widely reported locally to have "called for tougher Bitcoin regulations", that was the headline in the major papers...problem is, that's not what he said at all.
He asked for "regulatory reform" probably referring to the fact that right now in Australia the tax rules make Bitcoin 10% more expensive than anywhere in the world (it's double taxed).
The current fascist government thinks the internet is just a way to get faster porn videos (that's certainly true in part, let's face it) but they have not the first clue in the world of its significance apart from that. Just another utility to make money from in their view.

Rubbish. Your counter seems to be ad hominem against zerohedge (not relevant) and blah about "psychology".
According to the GAO the "crisis" cost $24 *Trillion*:
All because some bankers didn't want to lose their bonuses. Instead of 9 months of panic and reset we have a lovely 6+ years and counting of stagnation and the Wizard of Ben with leverage of 89:1 and a fantasy balance sheet of $4 trillion and climbing. They should try out a radical new economic system, the best that has ever been tried: it's called *capitalism*. Instead of a central bank *whose stated goal* is the steady decline of their currency's purchasing power, perhaps we could enjoy the fruits of technology and productivity advancements. Instead of chasing faster and faster to try and keep up with the tsunami of excess liquidity. Ridiculous. The model is Japan, 20 years of QE, GDP lower than when they started, stocks 65% lower, housing 75% lower. You probably also love Abenomics: they just printed a huge goods inflation number, and 21 straight months of declining wages. That is what is known as a declining standard of living, same thing we have in the US.
Do you think money is wealth? If so, then print away, we'll all be billionaires! I happen to think goods and services are wealth, and money represents them. Printing lots more money to represent the same amount of goods and services means...you have less goods and services per unit of money. That's all. You have *not* magically created wealth.
Bernanke focused on the Great Depression. Turns out that is the *only* scenario where the Fed researchers themselves could find a link between deflation and depression. Read for yourself.
If lower prices of goods are so unbelievably awful, then maybe you can explain why companies like Walmart and Amazon try so desperately to offer cheaper goods? "Oh oh lower prices kill off demand oh oh". Like I said at the beginning: rubbish.

Can I refer you to Item 12 in the following from the FDIC. Depositors are general unsecured creditors:
"...unsecured creditors should thus expect that their claims would be written down..."
It is unclear whether that would be AFTER current FDIC coverage. They are talking about G-SIFI, globally systemically-important financial institutions ...so presumably they acknowledge that the $5 billion the FDIC has on hand is nowhere near adequate.
The EU has said the same thing. The next bank bailouts are coming from shareholders first, then depositors, then bondholders...and only after all that is exhausted, then the taxpayer.

Larry Ellison needed an OS, he didn't have one. So he stood by and watched as OS developers created Linux (lots of it copy/pasted from Unix). They worked on it for quite a while, and Larry picked his moment. He had the basis and then grabbed a distro, said "thanks", and produced supported enterprise scale versions that can do what clients need. That's what Blockshare is doing to BTC via sidechains. My point is that it's the current BTC governance that does not allow it to respond to technical and commercial changes.

Nice try. The law prohibits the sale to the public of any product that uses Bitcoin derivatives. Circle does that so is banned.
The Bitcoin blockchain does currently serve as an asset register, this link is just one of many examples. All of the recent press including from the top VCs state that they believe this is an area of huge innovation:
You will lose in a court of law if you assert that a colored coin is not a "Bitcoin derivative". Now banned by law in the wonderful forward-looking country of Belgium. Luckily the only things they produce is stupid laws, armaments, and beer.

Of course psychology matters. Look where we are now: stocks reaching alltime high solely because everyone knows the Fed has "got their back" with unlimited free money. That's not a market, and it certainly is not capitalism. Look at a chart of the Fed funds rate and tell me with a straight face that is somehow normal. Or how about the JGB market?

Friend you are creating money from thin air. Yes I know that is what the current frac.reserve system does. If the quantity of receipts equals the quantity of gold however there is no money created. With the amount of money constant and the amount of goods and services rising (through growth, progress, productivity gains) we get a rising standard of living. Instead, through excess free money creation, we get inflation: a larger quantity of money representing the same quantity of goods and services. Money is not wealth: goods and services are wealth, and money represents them, just because you have a larger quantity of money representing the same quantity of goods (stocks, bonds, food, houses, whatever) does NOT mean you have increased your wealth. If adding to the money supply magically created wealth then why not just print up a wheelbarrow load for every citizen! Whee, I want my Ferrari in red! THAT is the madness of the current monetary thinking.

Except in the case that "Bitcoin classic" still has a market price &gt; 0, in that case there will be (at least) two "Bitcoins". Maybe they can rename the new one "BecauseGavinandMikeFeelLikeItCoin" (background sound of Bitcoin disappearing into altcoin obscurity and confusion...)
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:42:07
Nobody really talking about a few of the major elephants in the room. 1. Is it governable? The blocksize debate would seem to say No. Add the fact that there are so many different types of miners and wallets and SPVs, how would you do a coordinated "upgrade" even if you could decide which upgrade to do? March 2013 was lucky and probably can't be repeated today without huge disruption. 2. is the legality of colored coins, can an asset registered on a ledger that is validated by anonymous nodes have legal standing? UCC is pretty clear on this: No. Name one other example in financial or contract law where that could exist.
There's a war, between the people who want BTC to remain a speculative asset, and the people who want it to be a payments (even micro-payments) network. After 6 years and a max of 350,000 people using it (with &gt; 1 BTC), it's really not happening. Add the fact that the runup to $1100 was a bot faking demand, the fact that a few thousand bucks can spam the network to its knees, the huge efforts going into faster and more flexible consensus ledgers...it's not easy to see whether we will be talking about BTC any more in five years. IMO

Somebody should ask him whether an asset registered on an anonymously-validated ledger has any legal standing. He might look up the term "indorsement".
Bitcoin: a valid "bearer" instrument. Assets registered in the Bitcoin blockchain: not so much.

can someone clue me in, what does BitReserve have to do with Bitcoin? They store your "value" on something called a "card" which they (an unlicensed, unregistered bank domiciled in the Cayman Islands) issue and manage themselves. It's very unclear to me what the relationship between Bitcoin and their "cards" is. Thanks
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:42:29
I think AML laws are pretty specific. I think money transfer laws are pretty specific. I think jail is pretty specific. They already outlaw the possession of certain form of digital property under existing laws (digital child porn images are just one example) so I guess I'm not clear how Bitcoin magically escapes all of the above.
@_date: 2015-07-09 06:09:03

It's pretty simple, Bitcoin can't scale. Some people (banks, miners, and early adopters) want it to be a speculative instrument where scaling doesn't matter. Other people want it to be an actual payment system so they need to make changes to it. They yell at each other and neither side wins. Meanwhile, governable, scalable consensus ledgers pop up everywhere.
@_date: 2015-07-04 00:53:15
This is very cool! Now if an asset registered on an anonymously-verified ledger had any chance of gaining actual legal status (for anything but its own token) then that would be even cooler.
Oh, that.
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:58:56
Depends on your definition of a "confirmed" transaction. Propagated to the nodes? Or in the ledger. When the lawyers show up...I'm pretty sure which they will say is a "confirmed transaction". And I'm also sure there's plenty of legalese fine print when you signed up for your Visa card that essentially says the same thing. The bank extends you credit, you agree to be bound by the T&amp;Cs when you swipe your card, that transaction is considered "valid" even if settlement happens later. Maybe BTC just needs some legal to catch up. SPV transaction? It's a "final" obligation.
Any lawyers in the room?
(and let's keep it to the BTC "bearer" asset, not unregistered claims like colored coins that are not legally-defined indorsements).
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:50:39

@_date: 2015-07-26 09:50:31
You should blow your bosses away and explain to them the difficulty of establishing a legal claim on a ledger that is validated anonymously (like Bitcoin). "Bearer" assets on such a ledger (like Bitcoin itself) may be fine, but "registered" assets (like stocks, bonds, etc. that someone asserts are represented by a certain Bitcoin) may not be. Other distributed ledgers that have known nodes (Hyperledger, Ripple, many others) should not have this issue. You might start with the UCC concept of "indorsement":
Good luck!

LOL how quaint, you believe the rule of law still exists and this government pays any attention at all to it.
Obama has used the Surveillance-Industrial Complex "laws" many times to do whatever he wants. His "Justice" Department even sees fit to conceal not only the interpretation of a law secret...but the actual law itself.
Notice the wording of these EO's: it's first person singular. "I, Barack Obama, do hereby declare...". If these kinds of edicts could withstand the light of day they would be subject to the "checks and balances" of our divided form of government through the elected representatives of the people in Congress.
Since the Magna Carta in 1215 and especially since 1776 we have had a form of government based on the idea that man has rights above those of any king. This EO by contrast is just the king telling his subjects what he is doing. "Hear ye, hear ye...I am doing whatever I feel like".
Next week when he adds Snowden's name, or yours, to the list, don't try crying to your Congressman about it. He is irrelevant. And since this is enforced by Treasury they can do whatever they please. Treasury operates under a legal framework that is a holdover from King George, no required jury of your peers, no knowing who your accuser is or what the charges are, no discovery of evidence, and guilty until proven innocent.

She's waiting for the iris scan and blood test to come back from the DHS, then it has to go to FinCen. When FinCen approves, she needs the Comptroller of the Currency to give her license xf-2515. If/when she gets that, she needs to go to each state for her MSB license. Assuming THAT goes OK, then it's just a matter of getting IRS withholding rules right, and making sure she operates within FATF rules. Once that is done all she needs to do is submit Form 11-223-W2h5 to the CFTC, certify that she will report quarterly, and then post a security bond.

All good points. I'd just summarize by saying the following: America used to be better than other countries because we acted better than the petty dictatorships and war mongers of the world. Now we invade more than they ever did, we spy worse than the Stasi, we torture with the best of them, and we use pre-crime assassination as the main tool of policy, all while jumping up and down and blathering about "freedom" and "democracy". The people of the world are not stupid. We should just drop all the ridiculous hypocrisy: America does these things because it wants to make money. It's the world's apex bully. If we wanted peace we would be talking about peace conferences, not provoking the Chinese by sending destroyers to their shores and hyperventilating when the countries we destroyed (Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq) want to line up with other nations. The real winner is the policy choice to lob drone bombs on any nation at will because we think certain people there might commit a crime sometime in the future. Seems that is a dangerous new rule to promote across the globe. What happens when someone in China or Russia or Pakistan decides that the mayor of Newark New Jersey might commit a crime against China sometime in the future...the whizzing sound of a Chinese drone? Oops not the kind of world we want. But hey somebody makes a million dollars every time a drone is fired, so it's all good, right?

It's a way for investors to play the Bitcoin price without having to actually buy the Bitcoins. If the exchange does it right they will match their Bitcoin assets and liabilities without having to buy any Bitcoins themselves. I can't see how anyone would think this is somehow good for Bitcoin, it gives speculators and institutions a way to participate in any Bitcoin price rises and falls without having to actually buy or own any and to do so without having to own a fund like BIT that could get hacked.

Thanks for the reply, a few disconnects however. The Iranian people elected Mossadegh; why is it up to the US to decide that was somehow invalid? The Egyptian people elected the Muslim Brotherhood, same question. Seems there was a bit of nastiness in 1861 in the US; should an external third party have intervened to keep the sides apart? Or, since one side was seceding from the other, aided the incumbent against the upstarts? Maybe the external third party did not approve of the election of Lincoln, you're saying they should have overthrown him?
Here's the point: it's none of our damned business. The US should be setting an example and vocally disapprove of nations that torture and repress and violate the rule of law...not become just as bad as they are by doing the same.
Korea example is fine...but you might turn your moral compass on Vietnam. We killed 2 million people...but oops now they are a growing trading partner. We could have just skipped the part where we napalmed the place because we didn't like their form of government.

20 years in the forex business at the top levels. In the current currency wars we're seeing more capital controls not less.

Excellent points, somehow I think we agree 100% on many things and disagree 100% on others.
The British buying some cotton is orders of magnitude different from the British drone bombing General Buford's men at Gettysburg or telling Longstreet where the forces were arrayed against him.
Other actors "cornering self-determination"? Oh is that why they had an election in Gaza but the US didn't like the outcome (Hezbollah)? Assad got 65% of the last vote? Whereas Bush was appointed by the high court both times he took power, is that now called "self-determination"?
Agree: it's useless to bomb someone until they agree with you.

And shouldn't we be "regime changing" and "humanitarian bombing" the Chinese while we're at it?

Since WW II we've had a world "dollar-based" system. That means that before someone can buy a barrel of oil or a bushel of wheat, first they must buy a US dollar to pay for it with. The US uses this "exorbitant privilege" (and their massive military) to bully and control other nations and make them do what we want. The other effect is we can print way more dollars than other countries can their currencies, since 2 out of 3 dollars are soaked up by other countries around the world to finance trade and to hold as reserves. This also means we can print as many as we feel like since we also export any inflation to other countries. So, in the end, other countries have to run sensible finances, and we don't, and other countries get screwed anyway since everything is dollar-denominated. When you win the Big War you get to make the terms, we'll probably have to wait until the next Big War (coming soon) before this system is reset. China, India, Russia,  Brazil, and most others are really sick of the system as it is today, but it will take a financial crisis in order to change it.

I'll just repost from an earlier reply: why is it up to the US to decide what government people can have? Seems there was a bit of nastiness in 1861 in the US; should an external third party have intervened to keep the sides apart? Or, since one side was seceding from the other, aided the incumbent against the upstarts? Maybe the external third party did not approve of the election of Lincoln, you're saying they should have overthrown him? Here's the point: it's none of our damned business. The US should be setting an example and vocally disapprove of nations that torture and repress and violate the rule of law...not become just as bad as they are by doing the same. You might turn your moral compass on Vietnam. We killed 2 million people...but oops now they are a growing trading partner. We could have just skipped the part where we napalmed the place because we didn't like their form of government. Try the dictionary: "self-determination"

Let's recall who the customers of the NYSE are: Goldman, Morgan, Merrill. Most definitely not you and me.
And let's recall what they must do in their view to remain compliant: taint customers, not coins. They track where every Bitcoin is sent from their company, if they don't like the destination they immediately close the account and file a SAR (suspicious activity report).
The number of people who feel this is somehow good for Bitcoin should be &lt;= zero.

This makes it sound as though they are backing it 1:1 with cash which they print. But since they use the USD, does that imply they are printing USD notes? Seems far-fetched.
My other comment is that they are now a gigantic "walled garden". This new currency does not connect Ecuadorians with global e-commerce, it isolates them from it.

Just retrieve your seed hash from your wallet.dat file and like make sure you've got enough entropy, then just do a multi-sig transaction to the Lightning smart contract layer, don't forget to use a clean Linux machine via the Tor network, wait an hour or two to get some confirms, and you'll be done!

Coinbase would never have received an investment by the NYSE if they could not prove they could be compliant. As a result instead of tainting coins they are tainting customers. This != what Bitcoin is about.

I heard that Lawsky is pushing for county-level laws to make sure Bitcoin users are safe in all circumstances, once they coordinate all 3007 counties in the US, and have a cross-county database so all owners of BTC and the people they send them to can be ID'ed, they will form a committee to decide on a working group to elect a steering committee to decide mnimum fee levels. They're working with DHS on enforcement and deciding whether immediate jail time should be mandatory or if simple asset forfeiture is adequate.

Use your head. No information about their company or who they are or where they are registered, if anywhere. No information about any financial services licensing they would be required by law to have if they operate any investment scheme of any kind. No physical address or contact phone numbers.

Um hello have you never heard of Bretton Woods? Yes that is slowly falling apart, but countries did not "use the USD to set prices because it was convenient" , far from it. My statement stands, the petrodollar stands as a powerful instrument of control. And speaking of "confiscating assets from the productive" um what do you think the Fed's inflation targeting policies do? As the last real central banker Paul Volcker said "an inflation target of 2% means you rob the average worker of 75% of his purchasing power over his 30-year working life". Brazil, Cuba, Argentina, all have similar debt to GDP as the US so mismanagement is not the issue, they just don't have 2/3rds of their currency sending inflation outside their borders.

People say Bitcoin is a protocol. But does TCP/IP only have 21 million packets? Does HTTP only have a finite number of web pages? Does somebody own all of those packets and web pages? It's not really a protocol. 
The real point is that non-repudiable payment is not a flaw, it's a feature. Alipay (40% of online Chinese payments) is also non-repudiable, other market mechanisms take care of reversing payment if/when required. Ask the US Fed whether non-repudiable payments is a good thing to have to complement existing payments. Their opinion: yes.

LOL "banks invest in profitable ventures" LOL
Banks get free money from the Fed and charge 11% in credit card fees. What other business gets a zero cost of goods sold?
Banks front run everyone else in the various stock, bond, and gold "markets".
Banks write laws that put Mom and Pop on the hook for their gambling losses via the FDIC and then make their bought-and-paid for Congressmen to sign them.
Banks break laws and launder money for the worst beheading drug cartels and all bank officers are immune from prosecution for it.

Total rubbish, Obomba and Holder decided not to prosecute bank fraud because oh, oh, the banks are so fragile. It's not the banks' fault: put a tiger in a cage with a lamb and ask him politely not to eat the lamb? What a laugh. Unprosecuted rampant financial crime is the order of the day, just check the headlines sometime. Dodd-Frank is a joke, the parts the banks didn't write themselves they gutted, why else would you put bank derivatives gambling alongside Mom and Pop deposits with FDIC coverage? Obomba had his moment, the week he committed $172 billion to Citibank he could have bought the entire company for $6 billion but of course he had Timmy Geithner, the guy who was asleep at the switch at the NY Fed while the crisis developed, in charge. History will not be kind.

This is not that difficult, purveyors of Bitcoin can just ship a prospectus whenever they sell people Bitcoin. Then they can certify that the buyer is a "sophisticated" investor under the rules. And if someone sends you a Bitcoin, wallet software can ensure you also got a prospectus, and clicked through to say you are sophisticated. Maybe they can embed the prospectus in a Bitcoin smart contract.
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:17:46
If some people (banks) decide certain Bitcoins are not fungible then I think that kills the idea that Bitcoin itself can be defined as "fungible".
Imagine a $20 bill, if banks blacklist certain serial numbers (believe me, they have discussed it) then the USD would no longer be described as "fungible" since certain ones would not be.
"Sorry, sir, that bill was used in a bank holdup in 1991, I must take it out of circulation". That's no longer defined as "fungible".

BTC price is ultimately Hashpower/Cost per KwH, in the short run there are externalities like 16 nm chips but those are quickly reaching an equilibrium. The security of the network is a function of the price of the token, with 4700 MW per second required to run the network. Send $5 from your phone to the guy sitting next to you in the cafe in Rio...but that transaction must clear through a supercomputer in a cave in Iceland.

Did you send a Bitcoin to someone on their blacklist? Did you record the name and physical address of everyone you sent BTC to? Did you inquire of those people whether the source of their income was legal? Did they pay their taxes? Did you get a copy of their tax filings for 2005-2015 inclusive? Did you send them by certified mail to Circle in advance of sending them BTC? You have to conform to their regs if you want to use BTC.
