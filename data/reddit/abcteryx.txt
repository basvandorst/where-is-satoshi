I think this representation of the mempool is made by simply taking the transaction fee offered by the person who created the transaction (say, 103 satoshi), divided by the size of that transaction in bytes (say, 87 bytes). Such a calculation could obviously give non-integer sat/byte values. But every transaction fee is going to be an integer number of satoshis.

If Bitcoin is swinging between 4 and 8 blocks per hour, with a target of 6, will the difficulty adjustment even have that much of an effect? Isn't the magnitude of oscillations more of a problem than the average?

I see. So a bump in the average rate from, say 5 to 6, would make it ~20% easier to mine BTC after September 10th?

When you say fee discrimination, are you referring to the 0.25%/0% taker/maker fees on GDAX compared to the flat 1.5% fee on Coinbase? I mean, I'm sure they could equalize those fees to a single flat rate across both Coinbase and GDAX, but would anyone really be happy with that?
If Coinbase trading volume significantly outweighs that of GDAX, then the effective flat rate would probably be pretty close to 1.5%. Would you be happy with a 1.3% flat rate across the board?

Does your limit price have to be below the current market? Will it error out if you set your limit price at or $0.01 above market? I assume so, since that's not the point of limit buy.
What if you set your limit buy at $0.10 or $0.50 below current market price? That will almost certainly be triggered due to price fluctuation within the day.

Match.com *could* make it so that it gets added to your HSTS list after logging into it once, but it doesn't. Neither does Bank of America! Unfortunately, a lot of websites don't deploy HSTS properly, and aren't in the pre-loaded HSTS list when you install the browser. If they're not in the list, then they are vulnerable to this SSL strip exploit. The only thing different to the user will be the green padlock icon, which is easy to miss.
If you're using Chrome, you can query which sites are in your HSTS list by going to chrome://net-internals/ and testing websites. For example, facebook.com, google.com, and accounts.intuit.com (Mint, Turbotax, etc.) are in there. However, match.com and bankofamerica.com are not.
