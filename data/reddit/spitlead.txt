have you actually used bitcoin.tax?
question is does it reconcile everything?  like, let say I bought 10 eth on coinbase, moved it to poloniex and bought XMR or whatever.
Does it reconcile all that and get the basis correct?

Thanks, this is what I need.

I left out of OP that I currently have this exact situation happening with XRP's I bought in 2013.   I bought them through snapswap and they were sitting there happy and fine, then snapswap stopped operation in the US and consequently I lost my ripples which bums me out.  ripple.com and now snapswap.eu told me, very nicely, to go pound sand.
To be fair, they did try to notify but it was lost in spam folders.   That was just a 300 USD loss, but it got me thinking/paying attention to my coinbase which has considerably more money sitting in it.

I only know the mtgox story superficially.
coinbase seems more mainstream, not that mainstream has any value, but your point is understood and why I am asking.

So, this is part of my gross lack of understanding.
Lets say I have a wallet on my phone.
The wallet app is in essence, my btc.   Of that wallet gets physically destroyed and I don't have my btc anymore.   No different than a real wallet filled with cash.
cept if i have a backup.

Exactly why I held through 19k down to 3k....

i'm not sure we are getting a straight answer now, it seems like yes, as long as YOU created the seed, you are fine.  If you got a devce that had a card in there that told you what the seed was, you are fuked.

This was same for me, both ledgers I bought last year had no tamper proof tape or anything, but I did create the seed on the first one and I put that same seed I generated on the 2nd ledger as a backup device. 
Am I in danger or what?  That thing has 100's of thousands in value on it...
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:31:16
Yep, understood.
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:38:32
i agree, even now with 2k+ prices, this thing is still in the womb.
The US stock market is 18.3 trillion.  
Bitcoin is 35 billion.
So BTC is 0.002% of that.    
If BTC had 1% of the stock markets money directed into it, BTC will reach mind boggling numnbers...
false comparison, but its fun to compare...

coinbase is good for what it is, but a large portion of the community doesn't trust it.   The most fundamental reason being that your coins are in coinbases wallet, not YOUR wallet, because YOU don't have the private key...
