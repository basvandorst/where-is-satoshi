We are not going to get our BTC back there is no point in even trying honestly. Lets all accept, move on and work harder. Karpeles will be dealt with.

Completely agreed. There is a fundamental difference between a third party escrow and a multisig escrow that many of these critiques fail to understand. Evo had some fake version of multisig. From my experience it was disabled most of the time I had used the site and it when it was 'enabled' a lot of users had their suspicions that it was just a sham feature that was linked to the main Evo wallets.

I think you are confusing the term free market with the concept of a decentralized market. Evo was not truly a decentralized market because the participants depended on the administrators/developers to maintain the integrity of the market. The multisig feature would have made at least the transactions system decentralized however the listings/account membership etc. would have been under control by a supervising party. This heist is not a failure of a decentralized system, its just a reminder for why we require decentralized systems. Check this project out - I am not sure what the status is but it aims to become what Evo should have been :

Exactly.

If you look at some of the highly upvoted comments I have linked in my post you can see that they are criticizing the 'libertarian ideology' and are referring to this recent Evo bust to substantiate their view that Bitcoin can never work because in their opinion monetary systems cannot function without a central arbitrating party. I did not link any comments that criticized Evo for not enabling its multisig. I am one of the people who criticize Evo for not doing this - bastards. What can you expect from compulsive carding kingpins I guess..

I am inclined to say that these opinions are on the milder side of the majority's opinions - but this is a normative statement I am making and you are more than welcome to disagree. 
You can clearly see that the comments I have selected are written by some intelligent people no doubt. We all have access to the same information sources - we all know the fallacies and downfalls w/ mainstream media. There is a difference between willingness to accept paradigm shifts and between being misinformed.

I grew up learning that a free market system means an economic system where the prices of goods and services are unregulated - not the goods and services themselves. So even if your definition of free market is more in line with the meaning of decentralized as compared my own interpretation of free market - I believe I have given you an irrefutable answer on why this is was not a failure of a decentralized system (primarily it wasn't even a decentralized system haha)

I completely agree. My whole intention with this post was to highlight a fallacy of (what I assume to be) the majority's views on what Bitcoin is.

Please read my full post before attempting to stir up some sort of argument. It is quite evident that I am a supporter of Bitcoin - I was just giving the respect deserved to those who had written those posts displaying a skewed understanding of Bitcoin. Even though they may be biased towards the concept of a decentralized monetary system I think its quite obvious that the redditors whose comments I have included in my post seem to be individuals who are intelligent. I disagree with their opinions completely however I do think that they represent the smarter section of the majority of redditors who look down on Bitcoin.

I did not say their responses were intelligent I said that these people seem to be intelligent. My assumptions came from the structure of their rhetoric and their vocabulary - not the content of their arguement. If you spent a minute or two to read my actual post you would realize my stance on what they are saying.
