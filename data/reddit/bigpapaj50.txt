I am amazed at how long you made "buy low sell high" but yes. You lose money if you buy something for 19000 and sell it for 15000.

Nothing wrong with that. I am way too efficient at work still if I only look at the hot posts

Probably the same OCD reasons I can only buy in intervals of .005 there's something a lot nicer about owning a round number of something imho. I am also a weirdo who refuses to set my volume to not an interval of 5 though so what do I know

Right there with ya bud. Feel kinda bad though cuz half of my coins are my friends money who finally decided he wanted in last night around 15.5k. But hey. Just gonna be along for the ride at this point.

Did the same thing with my bill money at 9600. I took back my original investment at like 13000 and don't even care that I could have made a little more money. It's a lot less stressful now that I'm just playing with profits

Exactly what I did. I sold my LTC around the top which I'm very thankful of. 30% gains ain't bad for less than 24 hours

I just pulled out initial investment at 14k after nearly hitting 40% returns. Now I'm just playing with my profits instead of my life savings and can personally say it is a ton less stressful. Love that I still get to enjoy watching bitcoin skyrocket still though
