Yes technically I can change the code but I can only change it in a manner acceptable to those in power. Can I change the block size? How is that going to go over? Lots of people's changes are rejected. Some people's are accepted. That is a simple fact. Its a controlled process.

$100 to set up **a** node is disingenuous. What kind of power will this $100 node have? You have not described a decentralized system. Nobody is calling the U.S. Federal Government decentralized and yet while there isn't a dictator in the senate or on the supreme court, there are very few people significantly empowered relative to the ~300 million citizens.

Obviously there are people that control it. I can't change the code yet other people can... Does every single coin holder and/or miner have equal say in the network (democracy) or can anyone act autonomously (anarchy)? Clearly neither is the case. In reality there are people with varying degrees of power and control of the project. It is certainly "controlled". It is not a force of nature like a hurricane.

That makes no sense.
You can't prove circles don't have corners? If you can't prove a negative then it logically follows that you can't prove that you can't prove a negative, nevermind that any positive statement can be written as a negative and vice versa.

If you prove one you prove the other. circles don't have corners is a negative statement.

Their behavior is a strong indictment right now, there is a mountain of evidence. Seems like they need to prove they are not at this point. 
...Speaking as a financially disinterested party.

Seems like every transhumanist is into crypto ime. I'm guessing Zoltan is on your side as well. Especially when you consider he is a libertarian, he is probably a favorite to be a stronger ally than Cares honestly.

There is no fungibility issue. The protocol is the protocol and the protocol makes no distinctions. If someone doesn't want your bitcoins that is their prerogative. Humans are entitled to their autonomy. Bitcoin is built on the principles of free markets and autonomous actors. Managing humans as if they are a layer of a protocol is an absolute cancer. That is by its very definition centralized, collectivist action. Changing the protocol to preempt the autonomy of the actors in the system is tantamount to a takeover by centralized forces. Bitcoin doesn't exist to serve the agenda of special interests.
Sure you can fork bitcoin into some kind of privacy coin, but it won't be bitcoin. and btw, bitcoin private already exists. If that's what you want then buy bitcoin private or monero or whichever other fork.

there are coins that do that. bitcoin does bitcoin. everyone trying to add bells and whistles directly to bitcoin are doing it for purely political purposes to try and gain control of the network. bitcoin is money. decentralization was supposed to make coordination hard. thats the point. the rigid monetary policy is the value propositional.
"editable" bitcoin is a scourge. imagine, mining rewards get cut down the line... eventually people will be asking to 'tweak' the miner's rewards.... "let's keep fees low".  all of the sudden the entire value proposition of bitcoin is destroy. it becomes central bank run.
there should NEVER be a major feature update to bitcoin. it is imperative. if coordination occurs that means centralization is winning. segwit was a chink in the armor but the battle isn't over.

Do you honestly believe if you asked Ver point blank "Do you own the Bitcoin Cash project?" he will say yes? I think you are taking a small bit  of extemporaneous speech and really forcing a lot of specific, deep meaning out of it that isn't there. At the very least, it is *clearly* not clear that that is what was meant.
I will say it seems all cryptos have legit criticisms that they have to face and answer. This a young space that is growing and there are many unanswered questions. I think we should criticize things on there merits (or lack thereof) and not throw everything against the wall and see what sticks.
I think BCH faces serious centralization issues in its governance. That's a real issue we can all have a real discussion about. However, dissecting a 3 word phrase from a live debate and using it as a vector of attack? Where does that get us?

You should already be out if those are your sincere beliefs. The asset is extremely risky/volatile and there isn't much upside left. Better to just go with stocks, those will continue to go up over time with much much less risk.

not korean but I just spent a couple weeks in seoul. I saw one ATM that had bitcoin functionality during my trip. That is the extent of the crypto acceptance I saw in the wild. They are a very long  ways off from mass adoption, as is every other country I am familiar with.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:30:55
I think you misunderstand, I am much more bullish than you. I am long but I believe there is way more upside than you. If I thought BTC would never touch 20k again I would be out because there are many asset classes that will provide more return for less risk.

Sure, there could potentially be other criticisms unrelated to this discussion (I don't know what is in his portfolio and I don't know how you confidently could either)... BUT the above comment relates to whether or not he is or claims to be CEO. I don't see how your comment addresses that.
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:32:15
you're wrong. yours is the most common example but gresham's law generalizes.

Satoshi's vision, opinions, thoughts, have no bearing on what is right/wrong/true/false wrt to bitcoin. The whole point is decentralization. There is no king. There is no dictator. What is right is right and what is wrong is wrong regardless of who proposed/thought/uttered it.
Basically, these types of arguments do not support your conclusion which may or not be correct. IMO, the answer is clearly memetic, chains are legitimate if deemed so. Some say X is legit and some do not. Legitimacy breaks along some tribal lines and that's that. Over time one tribe may win, or perhaps not and they will live on in parallel, but OP's argument is just the noise of one disgruntled tribesperson complaining about a rival.

 *clearly*, referring to something as your project doesn't mean you claim to be or are CEO. The Yankees are my team, Nirvana is my band, Bitcoin is my crypto, this is my country... Seems like a serious stretch.

You are being too concrete and narrow. The whole point is that if you have two options (X,Y) to purchase something with and X is crappy (expected to depreciate/less liquid/whatever) and Y is relatively good, you are going to bias towards getting rid of X and hording Y ceretis paribis. If everyone is coming to the same conclusions re X and Y, then you will find Y gets horded, making it more scarce, and eventually the exchange rate changes to reflect the value differential. This is exactly what is playing out with bitcoin. One currency is more inflationary than the other, the more inflationary currency is saved less and the lesser is horded more. over time the exchange rate has changed to favor the less inflationary currency. 
Citation just to settle things:
 
Under "Applications" here is one quote:
"In the market for used cars, lemon automobiles (analogous to bad currency) will drive out the good cars."
Gresham's law is commonly to applied to things that aren't currencies at all. The the coin/metal example is just the classic textbook example but the law itself its about the general underlying phenomenon.

read the wikipedia article. what you are saying is verifiably false and i cited a source (wikipedia) that says as much.
