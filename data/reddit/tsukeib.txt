except it's fucking accurate, his child is another fuckwad. do you have some defense of ron, rand, or any libertarian that doesn't boil down to "muh freedoms!"? the platform exists for capitalist reformists who want their parent's house but don't want to give it to their kids.

You can have libertarian ideals of decentralized currencies and private drug enterprises while being against fascist apologists

except libertarians keep making themselves look like idiots next to them anyways, taking a step forward with drug regulation and two steps back by killing social security and age of consent. they keep pushing to kill government programs that their voter base is dependent on without any real contingency plan to address the number of disenfranchised persons left in the wake of that, not to mention the protections that these people need (from the also free bad actors). 
privatized systems are not decentralized, the center is just a single petty tyrant instead of an elected congress of them. democrats are center right push overs and the right has radicalized its hatred for poor black women. libertarians are literally no better than anybody in office right now. 
libertarian socialism on the other hand...

That’s been my biggest issue in holding coins now, I almost impulse sold when Sargon started getting posted here. Libertarians keep pushing crypto as this solution so they can make controversial content while still getting paid, and I don’t know how much a pet I want to be of this

that needing to ride inside another party inherently weakens the original party similarly. just like any real push for socialism has had to be as a part of the DFL (which really isn't interested in not being rich, either). i think we can both agree this culture of liberalism that's taken over has led to some hilariously dumb actors on the political stage (the body ventura is still the best actor governor of all time, unrelated but important). 
ron's moves trying to eliminate taxes are moves that would make reagan blush, not to mention that the current capitalist "experiment" has proven the private system to be a bunch of thieving hawks and definitely Should not be trusted with any of our current state operations. i am afraid of possibly watching russia's bribe based privatized medical system come over stateside.

I’d recommend Contrapoint’s video essay about him if you have 20ish minutes

i get that bitcoin's a libertarian wet dream but that shouldn't stop us from recognizing that Ron Paul isn't exactly a smart man. or that libertarians in general have a disfunctioning platform

I’ve spent more than a few hours listening to him be interviewed, even in favorable platforms (his first episode on JRE). It’s not that he’s alt right, it’s that he courts the unloved newfounded minority of cis white men. Jordan is a classic patriarch and recognizes no issues with that label or role as it exists. I don’t want to debate the value of that or the ideologies related, but to think that the Alt-Right’s efforts to prey upon listless purposeless dudes with anger issues doesn’t also look like the audience Jordan’s cultivated is intentionally ignoring the obvious.

tl;dr- big money already owns everything dude, fear mongering about secure stores of value is moot.
there is no dark net with functioning blockchains that is being traded publicly. so long as the internet is "public" (already debatable) inside states with regulatory bodies, then the internet (and everything attached) is at the whim of the same regulators. if you're afraid of The Man taking your money, and you think gold is a worse store of value because of a history of states taking wealth, then i hate to break it to you: the internet is regulated by those same motherfuckers.
state entities who control your wealth control the internet. the thing we depend on for the public ledger and for collaborative hashing. you can't mine in states with full net traffic information. like bitcoin (or any top 25 chain) can dodge any of that.
