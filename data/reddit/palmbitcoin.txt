Yeah these machines are making a killing, witch is why I can afford the 2%. I'm just happy to get people started. Visa doesn't deserve to make another penny as far as I'm concerned, but that's a whole other topic
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:51:53
cheers! thank you and I look forward to hearing from you!
@_date: 2014-05-02 05:32:59
I still love you. Really though,  back to the conversation. It's pretty funny that this pops up on google 
@_date: 2014-05-02 17:54:07
Possibly, a very long time from now. That same year a Big Mac will also cost $80
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:33:33
thats perfect, I'm there
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:44:36

This is a documentary about 4 people who don't know how to budget/plan ahead or live within their mean. They need personal finance counseling not a "break". I get it, the documentary was supposed to have deeper meaning but they missed the point completely.

Yes I do this, its just funny to me. peace

thank you so much, I cant believe how much work is out there!
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:40:43
I am going to look in to that. If I had a chance to work for Apple in the early development stage for free, just to get my foot in the door, I would have. The same trend is headed towards a lot of these startups.

programmer/coders are super high in demand right now. The service I provide is not tech at all, I am looking for a sales/rep position. These companies might not need me right now but as they grow Im sure my skills will be needed

man, it's super risky for both parties. Heres my guide though.
Selling bitcoin on eBay:
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:04:38
Yeah I'm very curious about this too. And where could I buy my girl a crazy hat for the race, using bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:23:21
Only$100 over spot price. I knew I should have worn a mini skirt today

Most affordable equipment that is currently available will be obsolete within a months time (if you want to compete with the mega miners for bitcoin) your best option is to mine other alt coins. Some of them even support good causes. You can watch the price and trade them in for bitcoin whenever you want, or you could even be mining the next bitcoin when it's less then a penny. Imagine getting in this 4 years ago. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 05:17:46
You know anywheres grammars for bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:02:07

I'll stick these in random places. I posted this because I think making QR stickers for guerrilla advertising is something others might want to do.

How many more of these videos are people going to make? And they always start by talking about the price to get the masses to pay attention. Shame on you child
