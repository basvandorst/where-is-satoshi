There was a post about this on recently that really inspired me. I copied and pasted the text of it below. Maybe this should be on as a separate post too.
This is a strange, risky post to make here, but I figure what the hell, the lounge seems to be craving discussion other than "Last day of gold!! :(". I've been consumed with this idea for several months now, and I just don't know where to post this or what subreddits would be interested in this idea. I'm looking for some likeminded people to see where this could go, and maybe the fine people of the lounge might have some ideas. *TL;DR at end.*
In short, I have been struck with a vision of sorts, and it is an entirely online "country." I've been calling it a "cryptocountry," and I think it already exists.
It doesn't physically exist anywhere, so you can never go there, but consequently it also has no borders. It has no laws, only guidelines, outlined in its Constitution, which reflect the worldview and principles of its members. It's not a cult; there are no secret handshakes. It's a symbolic gesture: the expression of the simple idea that people should be free to interact with one another and create experimental subcultures as they wish, so that we might all come closer to a greater understanding of the art of living as a human being.
Eric Schmidt said that the Internet is the greatest experiment in anarchy in human history, and to that effect, I've noted a profound shift in human culture this past decade. Everything is becoming more decentralized, crowdsourced, and open, and yet, at the same time, the world's gotten smaller. It has never been so easy to communicate and interact in human history, nor has it ever required so few middlemen. It's also never simultaneously been as difficult for authoritative bodies to suppress the free exchange of information. And most importantly, it's never been so clear that we're on the sidelines, watching our respective governments play games that we have no interest in, sharing the same dreams and goals and interests regardless.
These trends are sure to continue, if there's any good left in the world.
Since we have an emerging decentralized economy, mathematical tools to avoid being spied on (Tor), an emerging decentralized currency (Bitcoin), the existence of virtual militias (Anonymous, Lulzsec), decentralized media sources (everything from Reddit to Wikileaks) and perhaps an entirely decentralized [meshnet]( I feel that my vision of an "online country" already exists. People just haven't become cognizant of what they're taking part in yet: a great online society where people can talk to and learn from one another, engage in commerce with one another, share information and ideas with one another, create interesting experimental technologies, assist in funding one another's projects, and generally be free to do all of this without worrying about what every other random government in the world thinks about it. For most of human history, this has been the entire point of what what a "country" is supposed to be - a group of people interacting to enrich each other's lives, even when they troll and flame and hate one another. This is what the point of a country has been for thousands of years.
**What I propose is a simple experiment:** I want to give this thing a name, draft the way we see the world into some sort of Constitution describing how our ideal society would work, and declare that this society now officially exists, and anyone can participate in it. Rather than wait for the US to draft some kind of Internet Bill of Rights, I want to actually declare the existence of Internetopia or whatever, and actually create the Bill of Rights ourselves. I want anyone who feels the same way to participate in this experiment, and become a "citizen" of this country with its Bill of Rights for free, no matter where you live.
In general, we don't need a "state," because we can govern ourselves. We don't need laws, nor do we need presiding officers. We don't need a military, because we defend ourselves with cryptography. We don't advocate that people disrupt the local communities that they live in, or disobey local laws. We want only one thing: to be able to continue to interact with one another and develop as human beings. This place should be a repository for ideas and technologies that should have a home, but, for silly political reasons, don't. And in the worst case scenario - that there exists some tool to break the best modern cryptography available - then this forces the people with this tool to admit that they have it and show their hand.
This is, I believe, the root of [Larry Page's idea](
Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic, but there's something about this idea that I can't shake off. I want to see where this will go. I envision it so that no matter what country in the world you go to, you can meet up with people who are also interested in this idea and form some new friendships. I envision the establishment of [mutual aid]( networks, which would really make this akin to an actual country. I see it being a platform for technological experimentation, where people are playing with things like the Meshnet and developing more cool "controversial" stuff like Bitcoin and collaborating with one another. I envision this being the sole purview of romantic nerds at first, eventually turning into something much greater when the time is right. Maybe most romantically but also importantly, I see it bringing people together, so that if the shit hits the fan in the next few decades and we see global war, this reminds us of what we really care about.
Would people rally under this idea? I have no clue, but I have a deep sense that this is for some reason a really important idea, and I just can't get rid of that feeling. I feel that while it's just for fun right now, it could really turn into something significant. I want to see who else is inspired by this sort of thing and see what we could do with it, and after the recent privacy scandal and emergence of I'm more inspired than ever by it. I just don't know who's interested in talking about it yet.
Thoughts, lounge? Don't let me down! :-|
**TL;DR**: I want to declare an online country, with an online Constitution and "Internet Bill of Rights," that outlines clearly how our generation sees the world and what we want from it. Anyone can "become a citizen of" this country for free. It doesn't physically exist, you still have to follow local laws, but that's also the point. It's a symbolic gesture, but I feel it's a powerful idea, and my reasoning and vision for the idea is outlined above. I don't know where to post about this, but I want to find more likeminded people and see what could come of it.
