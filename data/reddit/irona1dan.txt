If net neutrality is repealed, what is the expected effect on BC?

Thank you so much! I really don't believe I saved it anywhere besides the original laptop, but I will look into it more after work. Any other places I could start looking through? Or any popular sites from back then that are still active? 
I appreciate you so much.

What would the private keys looks like? Outside of my original activity years and years ago, I know little about bitcoin.

Been looking through old emails, looks like it might actually have been 2013. I have a tiny amount of coin in an old slush pool account, I have a 50btc registration email as well. I do not remember much else. The only stuff I can find in my email is registration confirmations from 50btc.com, registration confirmation from bitcoin.cz (aka slush pool), as well as account deactivation due to inactivity confirmation from bitcoin.cz.

Sorry, my memory regarding this is hazy (hence why it is so hard to figure out where it may be), I was only like 13 at the time.

Yeah, when I realized I had this amount of bitcoin I searched for the old ass dell inspiron I had mined it on, my dad believes he threw it out. I try not to dwell on it, figured I'd reach out to see if reddit could work a miracle

I mined coins in ~2009-10, pretty sure I either had 150 or 1500btc. Forgot about the fact until this year, computer I did that on is gone. Cannot remember what pool I used, I do not believe I used a hard wallet, so i believe they are online. Can anyone point me to potential places they could be? Or is all hope lost? 
If someone can actually help me find it, 5% is yours. (So between $30k and 300k depending on the amount of coins in the account.)
Please God someone help me

Would the brc hypothetically be in my wallet with the associated email on blockchain?

Does anyone know what website had [this]( as their icon? Found a screenshot and realized I had minded in 2014, not sure what website by bc was on.
