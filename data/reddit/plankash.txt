Im definitely prepared to lose this, and more as I am planning to spend more, but I just dont like being one of the idiots that got into btc as it literally hits the highest price it has ever been in its existence. so i want to get that stench of failure off of me by having a plan of either breaking even asap or buying alot more during a dip to lower the average.
i tried to mine some on my alienware back in 2011, i gave up as i deemed it too much work for little gain. SMH

sorry, i meant 2550..

ya thats what i meant by first break even point. looking at the broader picture though, its not worth risking selling it at a break even point just to save 500-1000$ on the cost of btc, because it might just keep climbing

should i buy more without touching what i already have? or should i intend on selling what i have at a higher price and keep what i buy at the lower one

are you gonna leave the btc you bought at 2600 alone? or do you plan on selling that at first break even point or profit , and wait for prices to dip to buy more

lmfao thats a nightmare. but then how does one even make a profit if all youre gonna do is hold. lets say i hold. hold through 2550. hold through 3k. hold through 5k. great. but it always crashes right? keeps crashing..so i hold hold hold and it ends up crashing anyway. i guess constantly buying when it crashes is the only way to make money.

now the only problem i see is in 8 days btc being very high $ and being a pain in the ass to buy haha. i would buy some right now but im above my limit per week on coinbase so i have to wait. def will keep buying weekly though just depends how much. did you go into ether?

i meant 2550 lol

by break even asap i mean sell it all the second it gets back to 2550, and then wait until a dip/crash to buy more to erase the initial mistake of buying it at such a retarded price.
this 8 day thing really fucked shit up, only reason i did it was because coinbase debit card was not functioning
