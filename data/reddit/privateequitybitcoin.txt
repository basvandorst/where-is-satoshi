Interesting. I get where you're coming from - and maybe that's a good takeaway. Contrary to what some believe, the big banks aren't 99% traders who know what a "Bullish Descending Triangle" is..:) Maybe the concerns I've heard / I have really are just mainstream. I didn't realize that. My point was, "Here are the concerns I've heard where I work. I think my industry is important to the success of bitcoin. Maybe I'm wrong but this is what I think. I want bitcoin to continue to be successful so please help me understand these concerns or help me fix them. Hopefully ya'll can help others as well." 
Sounds like mine are pretty basic concerns. So be it. Thanks!

Thanks Zelgada! Just figured out the tipping system - took me a minute but I got there. :)

Thanks! The post will get lost in the mist of activity but I suppose that's the game. Just wanted to get it off my chest. On the volume, my concern is not that volume is low - that's to be expected - but that the volume is declining. Here's to hoping for higher volume in the future.

Nope! Not a trader. You lost me at "D3."
I'm still missing how declining volume is "not bad" or even "good." It seems to me (bracing myself for corrections here) that bitcoin depends on day to day use to be successful. Buying coffee, etc. This isn't a stock or bond in the sense that for some quant-y reason declining volume is actually a good thing. This is a currency and adoption should mean you "trade" bitcoins for daily needs. Right? No seriously, right? I feel like I'm setting up a softball here - but I genuinely don't know the answer. Thanks!

Great point on the fact that you can't force the hand of shareholders. I hadn't thought that through. As I said from the outset, one of the reasons I made the post was to learn. So Thanks! 
Many are trying to explain to me how the market cap isn't really $6b because not everyone will buy and sell at that price. I get it - the same argument could be used for any stock but the term "market cap" typically represents what you can sell at today. I made the mistake in correlating the market cap to PE funds that could buy the "entire currency." Some really jumped on that - my point was more to illustrate a contrast than to suggest an actual buyout. Apologies.
