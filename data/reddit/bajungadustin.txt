I left to get cigarettes and when I came back in my son said.. "dad... Mom just added me on Facebook"   
I slammed the door and stared at him and said "don't you fucking lie to me.. your mom did not add you to face book. You know damn well there is no wifi in the kitchen."

It's hard to turn a profit in bitcoin now because it's so big. Personally I'm putting 50 dollars a check I to the newest coin that's under .006.    So that's 1300 a year investing. And only one of those coins has to make it to 0.15 for me to make my entire yearly investment back. So 26 chances based on good research and a little luck can make a steady profit until the new coin fad wears off.

they would have to set it up with a Fiat transfer if they wanted to do it that way right? Or they would have to create and send the actual wallet.     
cause if you have 10 BTC on one exchange its not really in its own wallet.. its in an active wallet the site uses until you decide to transfer out. then the amount must be transferred off of your exchange wallet in order to his another exchanges wallet.. which means a transaction has to hit the block chain.    
they would need to use a trust system or a fiat conversion and send.. like if the bitcoin you had on an exchange was a simple digit instead of your actual coins it would be easy for the exchange.. they would just send the fiat and no transaction on a block chain would take place.    
But yeah i dont know why they have not done that.

yeah my concern with limits was "cashing out" not so much a point of sale or person to person transfer. I really dont plan on spending the bitcoin at this time but that could change. 
What i really want is a general way to monitor all the bitcoins i have and see their value along with other values of other coins. Im currently tossing some money into LiteCoins and Ethereum along side bitcoin just to see the way [Coinbase]( displays the 3 currencies they have to offer but i would like to be able to monitor all currencies i want to take part in from one location if that is possible. 
also.. easy transfer or syncing to a mobil app would be preferred but not required.
