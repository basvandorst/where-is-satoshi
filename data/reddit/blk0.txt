TL;DR: The author critizises the fact that end-point users, that have only a single channel open with his hub and spend most of their money, result in locked funds for the hub in that single channel that can't be rebalanced by the hub. Thus, the hub has to close such channel on-chain quite often to unlock some of the hub's BTC locked in such channels. The author claims that basically any hub will run into this situation and therefore the number of end-points (i.e. real users) that can be supported is only limited. Due to this observations, the scalability of LN is put into question.
@_date: 2018-09-03 07:14:04
As one commenter suggsted, this will not happen if most LN users consider their payment channels like checking accounts, i.e. spending throughout the month, but replenishing them with their pay check each month.

Indeed, because it doesn't. Increasing hashrate always implies price pressure. Only in the exceptional sitation of the reward halving, if every miner is already on the latest technology and mining already at marginal cost, they are forced to either stop mining entirely or to sell for at least twice the price just to recover their own cost.

@_date: 2015-12-07 12:35:10
Because more efficient mining chips can get you more profit out of the amount of electricity invested. Assuming the price is already at the equilibrium for the earlier ASIC technology, mining becomes highly profitable for you again while at the same time you can drive competitors out of business by selling BTC below their OpEx yet with a big margin for yourself. And yes, this creates pressure on the BTC price, but with support at the new, lower level of OpEx made possible by the new generation ASIC technology.

Idea: why can't we make certain hardforks uncontentious by softforking the feature first, maybe via an ugly hack like SegWit and maybe also accepting some known limitations, and then, when the softfork is enforced and apparently everyone is happy with it, we schedule a hardfork with the same feature but cleaned-up data structures and code base a year later or so. Since the feature has already been accepted using the softfork mechanism, the subsequent hardfork is by definition uncontentious -- if not somebody snuck in something in addition. For this to work, both the preliminary and the final implementation have to be designed at the same time such that the clean structures required by the hardfork for verification are in place from day one and the softforked "hack" can be removed withouth a need to carry legacy code or data structures forward. Just my two satoshis.

What happens if there is another emergency hardfork necessary and it takes longer than 2 days to develop the fix? Most nodes will have only the most recent 2 days worth of pruned blocks and can't verify the re-organized chain.

I want a mobile wallet that instantaneously buys the BTC from funds out of my account at the time of payment with zero fees. 
Futhermore , I want consumer-side discounts, such that there is a commercial incentive for consumers to ask for bitcoin payments.
If BitReserve had a mobile app, this would work by paying out of one of their FiatCards. Problem is the fees to get fiat stored there are too high to make this commercially attractive. But even if the fees were zero, there is no consumer-side incentive to use this payment method. Somehow, the savings in credit card processing fees have to be relayed to the consumer to make him ask for bitcoin payments. It should be the default configuration of BitPay to grant the consumers cash payment discounts unless their merchants opt-out of that offering.

Assume during the brief duration of an online transaction money is converted fiat-&gt;bitcoin by the buyer and bitcoin-&gt;fiat by the merchant. Then both conversions are buys/sells at approximately the same market price, thus there is little direct effect on the price. Nevertheless, exchange volume and thus money velocity is increased, which tends to decrease the general valuation of a monetary unit as more of it is available on the market within a given time interval as compared to a scenario with less online transactions. On the contrary, if everybody just hodls, less coins are on the market (lower velocity), thus the unit becomes rarer and thus more valuable.

I think floating the proposal *right at this time* plays on the fact that roughly 80% of miners run Core and are thus SW-aware, eventhough they are not signalling for SW. Thus, they will not actively mine a malicous, SW-invalid transacation. At most 20% of the miners (e.g. BU) will mine those. They will *not* hard-fork, though by standard rules! Their block will be orphaned quickly by the 80%-majority, thus they will re-join the main chain with high probability after two subsequent blocks have been mined there (0.8²=64% probability of occuring).

The crucial thing here is, that 2. does **not** imply that SegWit-validating miners actually mine SegWit transactions themselves! It's enough that they **don't** mine on top of SegWit-invalid transactions. And that seems to be the case for the current hash rate distribution: 80% mine using Core and thus won't mine on top of SegWit-invalid transactions, eventhough they never would mine SegWit transactions themselves. Only 25% signal readiness to do that.  Which is a 4x slow-down for SW transactions in the beginning, but good enough for a start.

Sure, but apparently item 1 is not *that* much (changing transactions from P2WSH to P2SH format, annoying shorter channel timeouts per default), item 2 does not really apply as this proposal is precisely meant as a mitigation plan for the case that SegWit does not activate, as an alternative to unblock the stalemate. Agreed to item 3. That's the price to pay. I think LN is much easier to update compared to Bitcoin itself. So, LN v2 with SegWit enabled could simply let all old-style channels time-out and only allow for opening new P2WSH channels.

Mortages may become prohibitively expensive in a deflationary scenario: the principal stays the same nominal value, but your income/purchasing power has decreased making it harded and harder to pay it back throughout a decaded. While inflation incentivizes debt, deflation disincentivizes debt.

I would consider this the most sensible way forward:
* backport the Lightning Network code to **not** require SegWit (i.e. accept need to monitor for malleated TXs) at first
* push for working beta versions and support in major wallets and exchanges as fast as possible
* demonstrate that VISA scale TPS are achievable and that the ecosystem is very well willing to add another protocol layer and accept the development cost
* no roadblocker, if indeed the economic majority agrees to the long-term transition to LN, as suggested
* far higher TX/s almost immediately, above what big blockers have ever demanded
* demonstration that this approach works **in practice** up to some known limitations that could be removed by activating SegWit and (simplifying) updates in LN, including the possibility of **even higher** TX/s
* demonstration to miners that channel-closing LN transacations are willing to pay very high fees, as each is accomodating e.g. thousands of individual LN transacations.
* annoying malleability monitoring, until SegWit
This is a constructive way forward that actually puts the SegWit+LN roadmap to an early test by activating LN first. It's purely layer 2, so no Bitcoin politics involved. It offers this roadmap for adoption to the economic majority (real users, exchanges, etc.) which will demonstrate real support of this roadmap. If this is rejected due to wallets and exchanges **not** adopting LN, then we have a more serious problem than expected and are lucky to learn about it early. It completely circumvents the blocksize debate ("Cypherpunks write code."). If LN adoption indeed happens, even including this annoying malleability monitoring work-around, there is (1) no more time pressure, as there is more than enough TPS available to scale for a decade, (2) there is litereally no (currently waged) counter-argument anymore to not just apply SegWit. It just fixes the only down side of this approach.

@_date: 2017-02-28 10:17:42
No. That's incorrect. It is true that currently only ~[25-30%]( of miners would *create* SegWit transactions. **But**, the crucial thing is that ~[80%]( of miners run Core and thus *will not mine on top of SegWit-invalid blocks*. This means, that any rogue miner creating SegWit-invalid blocks will get orphaned with probability 0.8²=0.64 and then move back to the main chain (unless they hard-code the hard fork, which they could do today already). Thus mining on Core 13.1+ and not actively signalling SegWit is still some kind of *passive* SegWit support. This is what the proposal is exploiting: Turning passivity from a "veto" into "passive support."

I guess if you're invested by the millions and don't like SegWit, you still might want to upgrade the client to some recent version and disable SegWit for any number of reasons, rather than stay with some stoneage version forever after.

Well, UASF is only kind of "safe" if majority hash rate mines on Core (or some other SegWit-aware client) in order to *not* mine on top of SegWit-invalid blocks. Currently, that's what WU is doing. But he might switch to provoke a hardfork.

Interesting. I suppose you are refering to the fee market being enforced. So, this means your true and serious concern for the commercial support of the miners is met by a rejection of the proposal by the miners themselves. I would assume this should trigger a re-evaluation of the current roadmap or communication
strategy. 
My conclusion would be, that enforcing a fee market *at this time* is probably being considered too early even by miners in favor of on-boarding more user. What is yours?
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:08:21
Right. But some things are cheap to do on ASICs even *today*, while others aren't *yet*. 
The question is, do we switch to a hashing function where the same hashpower concentration problem is one ASIC spin and datacenter upgrade away (~1 year), or one where we are a few ASIC and memory *technology cycles* (5-10 years) away.

When I started following bitcoin in 2013, Gavin was a reasonable coder and technologist, a level-headed guy. But the day he released his very first block-size proposal, something flipped -- he kind of went from level-headed to full-retard from one day to another. At least as far as I can tell. When I read his endorsement of Wright, I felt sorry for the guy, for having been fooled. When I read this tweet, I was just shaking my head how the lead maintainer of one of the most security-concerned projects out there calls BU a "viable, practical solution". Sorry, not even close. That's just absurd. He just lost it somehow, and I feel sorry for him. Because I still like him as a person. But by statements like this he keeps proving that his departure was indeed good for the project.

Actually, the backward compatible design of extension blocks or auxilary blocks is the correct way to reasonably scale the system. It is quite analogous to the very successful transition from the Intel 16-bit x86 architecture to the 32-bit x86 architecture. Everybody was using 16-bit MS-DOS and there was a serious 1MB limit as well (insert 640KB Bill Gates quote). To over come it, people had to use "expansion memory" or "extended memory" in quite an awkward way. But eventually, native 32-bit operating systems came along that could still run the 16-bit applications in a compatibility mode leaving nobody behind, yet they provided the full 32-bit power to native applications. People had to switch at some point of their convenience. Eventually all people switched as they had ever more reasons and motivation to do it. This is how you service your customers, keep the network value, while not getting stuck in the past. And yes, the price of it is to carry extra baggage. Even today every x64 CPU still has a legacy 16-bit real-mode fully implemented and supported, but probably used by almost nobody anymore. But people could, if they wanted to.

If after a BU HF the BTC chain becomes slow but remains "workable", i.e. difficulty would be expected to adjust in a few weeks and sufficient hashpower remains mining to keep this expectation valid, then I would vote for sitting it out. I would work on a well-tested emergency PoW HF, though, just in case.
In case the BTC chain becomes practically unusable, i.e. because hashpower is leaving so quickly such that there is no workable bound on the expected end of the retargeting period (or even individual confirmation times), or if some former BTC miners actively attack ("kill off") the BTC chain e.g. by selfishly-mining empty blocks only, then launching the PoW emergency HF will be the only option left. 
A PoW emergency HF has to be prepared. But it must only be used retaliatorily, never preemptively.

The difference this time is, that this affects the (governance of the) core protocol, not some shady exchange or whatever. There is a real threat that bitcoin-as-we-know-it may just die due to the majority of hashpower withdrawing leaving the difficulty too high for anyone to mine until the next retargetting period. Sure, Core could fork too, but neither chain would survive without a lot of damage in value. Why would you trust a BU chain founded by malicous attackers? Why would you trust the bitcoin design, even if emergency forked by core, if it has just been demonstrated that hashpower attacks are the real existential threat?

Here is an alternate take: Mining empty blocks using a selfish-mining attack will kill the main chain and requires only 1/3 of the hashpower. Since you can't move coins (e.g. to exchanges), value will go to zero. Once value is down, all remaining hashpower has to move to BU chain to survive. While hashpower is leaving, Antpool can start moving hashpower over to the BU chain as well, just keeping enough on the old chain to stay two block ahead mining all empty blocks and keeping mining there unprofitable for anyone else. Perfect replay attack protection as TX will only confirm on the BU chain. To keep the Bitcoin alive in their sense, Core will be forced to perform an emergency hardfork to another hashing function. Then, none of the two chains can claim to be "the real bitcoin" anymore, because the original chain has died.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:34:07
The compromise is to lend BitcoinEC a hand to get a high-quality Emergent Consensus client out there. Then, everyone gets what they want: Core gets SegWit activated, BU folks get the possiblity to manually change consensus parameters at some future point in time (they are not asking for such a thing right now anyway). So let's upgrade BU nodes to BitcoinEC and be done with this discussion.

A key difference to the ETH/ETC situation is that the minority chain of a bitcoin fork may be so slow as to be unusable. Yes, you might have coins on both chains, but you may not be able to move your coins on the minority chain to an exchange any time soon, or with outrageously high fees only. 
It may also happen, that BU will try to simply "kill off" the minority chain, by 51% attacking the remaining hashpower there and mining only empty blocks. Thus, coins may become unusable and thus worthless on the minority chain.

Well, if you have 2/3 of Bitcoin's hashrate, you could use 1/3 to selfishly empty-mine the current chain, and 1/3 to perform the BTU HF. Since the BTC chain is now unusable even for benign miners, they have to mine the BTU chain in order to even be able to sell their blocks and recoup their investments. Once this gets moving, hashrate on BTU will surpass BTC and you can even start shifting more of your BTC hashpower over to BTU, maintaining just 1/3 on BTC until you're the only miner left. Then BTC is basically dead and you can switch off life support.

Since we are talking about softforks which are by definition optional to use, institutions may choose to never support certain future features or to validate the stricter rule set. They can't avoid the network from upgrading. They could choose to not buy mined bitcoins from miners supporting certain features with the block they mined. This would disincentives miners from support certain softforks. But only to the extent, that they can't find other buyers. Thus, as long as miners can sell their blocks, they will mine them. Freshly mined bitcoins sell already for a premium, maybe they need to be bribed to enable certain future softforks. The market will decide. Thus, institutions can only block new softforks if they also are offering to buy most freshly mined bitcoins at the highest premium, but avoid buying those blocks validating softfork rules.

Usually people are excited about the long-term exponential price increase of bitcoin over time, i.e. a function like y=exp(poly(t)), where t is time and poly() is some polynomial function. OP's function is of the form y=exp(C*log(t)). But that reduces to exp(log(t))^(C) = t^C. Thus, in his model, price growth is no longer exponential in t (i.e. e^(t)), but rather polynomial (a constant power C of t, i.e. t^(C)). While still impressive growth, there is no compounding effect anymore.
@_date: 2017-01-31 10:04:49
Probably true. Anyway, you may still add some extra fee for just your favorite pool. ;-)

Because the consensus rules concerning  transactions (in contrast to those applicable on the block level) are *identical* for both chains. Transactions don't "select" a chain at all (the replay protection of Bitcoin Cash introduced a flag bit to this end).

If you do a time+RBF style split, it might take a couple of tries to succeed, but even in the case of failure you're still in control of all your coins on both chains. There is no risk of loss of funds, it only might take a while and might become expensive in TX fees.

Isn't causality working the other way round? The fork is activated once 75% of the miners mine BIP100. Thus, the other fork has 4x larger block generation times (until readjustment) which makes it 4x less useful. Thus, one might value it at 25% of the orginal coin value.

Nice, but way too complicated. Just look for the longest period between the historic ATHs and the time price recovered back up to the ATH. As of today that's the time between 2013-11-25 and 2017-02-20. That's about 3 years and 3 months, or roughly 171000 blocks. Thus **ANY** coin held for longer than that period ever has appreciated in value.

LN experts, please check: Isn't this scenario a real possibility? Consider a major LN hub becoming unresponsive for some reason (like e.g. an exchange starting an exit-scam). Then, many people will try to run for the exit and simultaneously trying to close their channels driving up fees and the mempool size. This might make closing the channel uneconomical for small channels, or cause some closing TX to sit in the mem pool until they expire. In both cases, the hub could get hold of the money. Right?

Well, it's fun satire mocking about the anti-competitive behavior of certain players. Nevertheless, I have to say it's easier to mock if you have only your own development time and not $100M of (probably) other people's money on the line. Given the incentives, it's clear what rational miners will do. If we don't like that, we have to change the incentives rather than start moralizing.

I've just checked out this ATM today! It worked quickly and flawlessly. In the beginning it asks you about the amount: &lt;€250?, €250-€500?, &gt;€500? I just bought for €5 as a test and didn't have to identify. I did notice the finger print reader on the box, though. After selecting the first option, scanning my QR code, inserting the bill, and confirming, the transaction went through smoothly and quickly. I got the BTCs on my Mycelium wallet after 1 confirmation. The only draw back: you can't pay with BTC in the very same strore. What a pitty! ;-)

It appears as if the fixed point of bitcoin's evolution is to not evolve at all. Neighter by force nor by laissez-faire.

Bitcoin's security should be based on solid game theory, properly set incentives, and explicit worst-case assumptions. The plan was to rule out the necessity to appeal to ethics and to trust in ethical behavior. Unfortunately, the assumption of an honest majority appears to be invalidated. And also unfortunately, the network upgrade mechanisms are at odds with the security assumptions.

Has there never been a motion to make a BIP out of the Electrum protocol then? I would much prefer to have an additional compile-time or run-time option in Bitcoin Core to create the additional index and expose it via the API than having to run a completley different software package that force me to: (1) re-index the Bitcoin Core blockchain database as -txindex=0 is the default (that was quite disappointing to learn!) and (2) build the Electrum index going over the exact same blockchain database that would have been available in step (1) already, which all takes forever. The additional txindex in Bitcoin core plus the additional ElectrumX index are quite small compared to the 110GB blockchain, so I don't see why these indices are not built by default at once, when one takes the effort to download the blockchain the first time. Straightening this out should minimize the hurdles to set up an economic full node as one could immediately use it to connect HW wallets (via Electrum desktop) and mobile wallets (via Electrum Android) to such a fullnode. Maybe it would suffice to just create a BitcoinCore+ElectrumX distro, where everything is pre-configured nicely and smoothly.

to et al.: 
Guys, 
**WHY** did you choose to intentionally break SegWit by building on yet modifying it in an incompatible way? 
Your proposal could have been such a nice next step *after* the deployment of SegWit (which you seem to embrace anyway). But you unnecessarily chose to make it incompatible and conflicting. 
**WHY?** 
Such a great idea, such an opportunity to resolve the conflict and you guys blew it. 
I also don't understand the incentive of you, in particular: You have just caused more delay on the route to fix malleability and thus enable your own lightning network on the main chain. 
Please fix your BIP to be compatible with SegWit so we can all move on. 
Thanks, blk0

You need both, some CS as well as some Econ in order to "get" why Bitcoin has been designed the way it is. Falkvinge, for whatever reason, chose to neglect the CS part. Furthermore, I'd like to object the "appeal to autority" label: I didn't appeal to any particular person ("authority") and anybody is free to study the subject. Just get them a decent distributed systems textbook that discusses Byzantine fault tolerance for a start. No magic about that, it's just a scientific topic that has been studied for a long time, which would be unwise to ignore.

^^ This is how I would envisage updates to the Bitcoin system as well! This is how you upgrade legacy systems. Just like the successful Intel x86 CPU architecture evolving from 16bit -&gt; 32bit -&gt; 64bit. Nobody was left behind.
One point people complaining about "complex code" don't realise is, that adding extension blocks (e.g. 8MB, 32MB) would in principle allow you to start on a green field when designing that block. So, basically once you added the small modification to Core for branching off to handle the extension block, you are basically free in designing extension block transacatio formats, etc. Yes, code to handle the 1MB block might be duplicated, but then there is the real chance to rewrite it and design it better in the 8MB block -- with minimial constraints and almost no modification to critical code in the Core code base. I think one can see this to some extent already in action in the SegWit code, which also introduces new addresses and payment types. But the concept could be driven forward much more rigorously.

A softfork is successfully activated once a majority of miners enforce the new, stricter rules. Ideally, a large majority. This implies that your block including the NOP would be considered invalid by the majority of miners. Therefore, they would reject it and not mine on top of it. It would be orphaned.
Additionally, if once the economic majority of fullnodes has upgraded, they will not forward your block, so it won't even reach the other miners. And since the block is rejected by most potential buyers, you could not sell your block reward. Therefore, you as a miner, are very much incentivized to actually adopt the softfork rules to maximize the chance of being able to sell your block reward and that others mine on top of your block. For the same reason, miners also cannot revert the activation of the softfork. That's why fullnode upgrade is really important, to keep the miners honest and funds safe, that are locked relying on the new rules.

Well, looking at  we see that the profitability of mining on either chain has equilibrated by now. 
This means that hashing power can freely move back and forth without profitability being a constraint. What other reasoning can influence miners moving? They could be easily pushed in either direction by some other reasons. 
For example, the recently suggested PoW softfork (scaling in another POW function next to SHA256) would easily have that effect. What other incentives could push them in either direction?

I think if millions of embedded miners constituting say 90% of the hashing power sell their mined bitcoins rationally at slightly above marginal cost, then even more efficient ASIC farms could not depress the price below the marginal cost of 21 Inc's miners, as the farms only mine 10% of the newly mined coins, whereas 90% will not be sold below marginal cost. So, by sheer volume and aggregate hashing power of the embedded miners, they will keep the price at approximately their marginal cost. It would take orders of magnitude more efficient ASICs to get the hashingpower of the largest centralized farm on par with the decentralized miners. But then, also the 21 Inc miners can upgrade to the latest technology in turn. They only need to be in the same ball park of efficiency with the mining farms, no need to be top notch.

I'm only saying that the hard fork debate has been suppressed by core developers in the past, one way or another, but undeniably, so that saying afterwards "look! no one wanted to even talking about it!" is a bit disingineous. So much to my comment on the article.
Having said that, notice that I did not advocate for any particular hard fork, or forking at all. Nevertheless, I think that research on forking mechanics, be it hard, soft, or soft-hard, or whatever, or network upgrade mechanics in general, is very much on-topic for a Scaling Bitcoin conference and maybe should have gotten more into focus than it has been.

I have some background in quantum computing, and putting the major long-term technical improvements of bitcoin (back) onto hardness of discrete-log is worrying me. OK, quantum computers breaking discrete log may be out a decade or two, but putting new technology on this flawed footing doesn't align with the general risk-averse conservatism I like about bitcoin. Currently, pub-keys are hashed which kills the exponential advantage of quantum computers (or reduces the window of exposure at least) and in any case, ECDSAs can be replaced by existing post-quantum DSAs, if needed. But with all innovations based on more sophisticated properties of EC crypto, how will they be replaced once QCs become a real threat? What's the plan B here? Why doesn't the original research already start at the basics with introducing post-quantum DSAs to bitcoin and then building funky stuff on top of that? If this is not known to be possible, then all this EC magic is just kicking down the gas pedal into a dead-end road. The mental energy spent should be invested into more wisely elsewhere. If we continue like this, we will have EC magic in 5-10 years usable on bitcoin, then we will enjoy it for 10 years, before we finally hit the wall once a 5-10k qubit quantum computer kills all the new EC features, while we failed for 10 years to find any suitable replacements. Had we only started today with that research.

Yes, but in practice miners will run out of money if they can't sell their block mined on the minority chain (whichever chain that is). It all depends on the buyers of the mined blocks: will some buyers *reject* blocks from longer, Core-valid chains and rather *buy* blocks from the shorter, Core+BIP148-valid chain? Only this keeps the miners mining and/or switching.
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:01:27
Not quite. I'm only proposing to mine **one** block and use the time until it's orphaned to "double-spend" non-segwit full-nodes. 
But you are right, if one would indeed put significant hashing power to mine on top of that block, that would create a fork where segwit UTXOs could be spent by anyone (that's what ViaBTC is threatening). My attack is just a micro version of that.
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:25:58
In my opinon, ECC is already broken (in principle) by quantum computers. It may take a decade or two to make the attack practical, but from a theoretical point of view, ECC is already insecure. OTOH, there *are* post-quantum DSAs out there. Why is there no proposal to phase these in slowly into Bitcoin, and *then* try higher-level constructions (e.g. CT) on top of those?

I think this BIP148 PoW change in August is overly dramatic. BIP148 presses for the activation of SegWit. I think it's the merit of BIP148 that the NYA Agreement had miners agreeing to activate SegWit even before that. This should be exploited. If miners activate SegWit by a softfork -- no matter how (BIP141, BIP148, BIP91), Core wins. The real decision point is the 2MB hardfork. If most of the hashrate forks, this would justify a PoW change. But August is too early for that.

An important caveat, but actually it's not twice as long. Quantum fault-tolerance only requires a constant factor overhead in qubits. With 16% exponential growth, that's just a few more years, 10 should suffice. So in 35 years we might have the 2330 *logical* qubits required.

Because it is significant to understand the limitations and threats of a crypto system. In a couple of years down the road, QCs will be able to break current bitcoin's crypto and e.g. move Satoshi's coins. We are still ~2 decades out, I think, but recent experiments and improved implementations move the goal post closer. There is enough time to upgrade bitcoin's crypto in the mean time, but we can't ignore it.

If the [projection of the Google group]( becomes true, they will achieve 49 raw qubits within this year. That would imply a qubit growth rate of ~16.5% p.a. (relative to 2 qubits in 1996), thus a doubling in 4.5 years and 2330 qubits in ~25 years.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:12:15
No, it doesn't. Would be a smart move, though.

Indeed. That's true for all P2PKH and P2SH addresses, but *false* for P2PK addresses (without hash), such as Satoshi's 1st million of BTCs mined.

In all fairness, I have to state that the 2330 qubits refer to ideal, fault-tolerant, logical qubits, whereas the 17 qubits currently achieved by [IBM's quantum processor](  are raw, imperfect qubits which could be used to encode [7 logical qubits]( Yet, quantum error-correction of even a *single* fault-tolerant qubit has not been achieved in experiments today.
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:09:47
Cryptography can generally not be based on NP-complete problems, since non of those are known to be ***hard on average***. That is, NP-completness only stipulates that *there exist* some hard instances. But it's fine if most instances are actually quite easy to solve. What one needs for cryptography and proof-of-work, is that *most instances are actually* hard. That is, *most blocks are actually hard to mine*, not just some, or few. Hash functions have been designed to have outputs computationally indistinguishable from uniform randomness, such that collisions are practically as likely as drawing identical outputs from two i.i.d. random variables (see birthday paradox). Thus, finding a partial collision is very unlikely and thus hard on average, otherwise the computational assumptions on the hash function would be violated. As with most of modern cryptography, the hardness claim hinges on this unproven assumptions, though.

Quantum computers can only gain exponential advantage over classical computers in very specific and limited settings. Integer factoring and the discrete logarithm problem are such examples, which can be solved efficiently using Shor's algorithm. For general search problems, only square-root speed-ups are possible using Grover's algorithm. For example, this reduces search time from 2^n to 2^n/2 , which is significant but still exponential time. Since P2PKH (pay to public key hash) hashes the public key, a quantum computer has to solve a hash collision problem first, for which it only has a similarly modest advantage over a quantum computer. Without that hash (e.g. P2PK) a quantum computer has exponential advantage. I'm not familar with ioata, but to be sure, there are indeed public-key crypto-systems that are not known to be broken by quantum computers, such as [McElicie]( For more information, see [Post-Quantum Cryptography](

Indeed, adding more qubits is extremely hard. People are trying very hard to come up with an exponentially scalable architecture, but we are not there yet. The 17 qubit processor announced by IBM would indeed rather indicate linear growth of +1 qubits every ~2 years or so. But if Google achieves their 49 qubits this year, this would rather support an exponential growth assumption (and IBM would appear as an outlier). There are only a few data points (=experiments) so far. The projection is only about raw qubits.
