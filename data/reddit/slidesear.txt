The only way he or she can prove this is to give me one of these random giveaways. 
My address:

@_date: 2018-01-30 19:27:58
Did she capitalize the "C"?
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:05:41
So basically, Craig Wright?
@_date: 2018-08-17 04:36:44
Underrated comment. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 05:43:47
Does it come with ASIC Boost? 
@_date: 2018-05-30 02:37:32
That's beautiful. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:30:34
I'd like to know too.
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:34:42
I am glad laughter could come of this. I wasn't so happy at the time though.
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:49:35
How close to the moon can you get in that thing? 
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:15:22
Sorry guys. False alarm. I Googled my addresses rather than searching them directly. The Google results used to go directly to my wallet but now it's pointing to another one. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:36:33
Thanks Bash! I found them by looking my public key up directly.  
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:35:41
Yeah, I didn't look up my wallets correctly. All is well now. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:49:51
Alright boys! Time to shut down the internet since it can be used for illegal transactions!
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:35:02
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:42:05
Haha! Noted. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:22:55
Sent one from the US. 
Edit: Got it! Used Chrome to send it to my mycellium wallet. Got it in seconds. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 05:41:45
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready.

I got into it because the tech sounded amazing, which lead me to watching some videos on SHA encryption, which lead me to buying into the technology. I like sharing this info with friends/family/co-workers to get them to learn somewhat about Bitcoin and the Blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:33:09
Asshat. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:56:34
And gone!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:20:11
Nice! Mars = 50K
@_date: 2016-02-28 19:19:38
Can you setup a live stream for this? 
@_date: 2018-11-27 04:51:01
Gold here I come! Thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:15:46
I wonder what would have happened if you didn't have that money in your account. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:09:10
Small please. Let me know if I can help with this in any way. I am open to paying you as well.
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:35:48
What's up with all this free "Au" going around?
@_date: 2016-10-29 14:16:23
Pricecisely. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 07:10:28
Blocks? 
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:41:48
Is this a "missing the *ed" from the word "learn" reference? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:08:26
Bye Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:53:26
I want, where get?
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:41:54
I like buy better. ��
