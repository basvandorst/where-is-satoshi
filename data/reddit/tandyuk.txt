The title does clearly say UK.
Australia is a little out of my coverage area!

A little off topic here...
And no its not handling that little DOS attack very well.
Clearly some people still need to grow up.

They are residential packages.
Updated my last post to highlight the quality differences.
We have no intention of even attempting to compete with Virgin/Sky/Talktalk/etc.
Anyone who is happy to put up with their quality of service and support enjoy your savings!

Other providers Line Rental...
BT: £15.99/mo
Virgin: £16.99/mo
Plus we don't lock you into any long contracts.
Seems like a great deal to me!

Giving a price comparison is not slander.
Are you saying that the WU rates shown on that board are false?
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:04:56
We can provide full native IPv4 or IPv6 connections, or of course dual stack.
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:19:17
Indeed you are correct...
Just found  buried in google.
They have been accepting bitcoin since October last year.
They are still advertising ADSL BE/O2 Broadband though, so not sure how up to date their website is.
I'll update my post.

How about you suggest what some of these "far better solutions" are.
WHMCS is actively developed, and we have developed several modules to integrate with our service providers and in house systems.
Migrating to an alternative would not be a trivial matter, and ultimately pointless.
If you kept to just bashing the *design* of the site, I might be able to take your criticism more seriously.
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:14:28
Yes, Like all ISPs we have to protect our customers from the minority who attempt to abuse the services.
Our policies are clear and fair.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:02:59
Last time I checked, a flood of traffic from port 123 destined for port 50000, doesn't constitute people visiting the site.
"Anyone interested can contact us on 08444140340 or via our website,  Note there is no mention of broadband on our website yet, I am currently working on adding a Line checker so you can see what speeds are available, and hope to have full online ordering available by the end of the month."
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:00:03
No, that is the price for the broadband component only.
Line rental is £12.60/mo inc vat for residential lines.

One of the keys to help bitcoin adoption is the ability for companies to be able to stay within the bitcoin ecosystem.
Currently the vast majority of bitcoin accepting businesses do so by utilising payment processors who instantly 'cash out' their bitcoins back into a fiat currency.
By accepting payments in bitcoin, and using the blockchain API to do so, I hope this can help stimulate businesses to adopt bitcoin as they will be able to pay for their phones, broadband and hosting using the bitcoins they take in sales.
Therefore not having to 'cash out' and truly removing all the banks (and fees) from the process.
A couple of my wholesale domain name suppliers also take bitcoin, and with the HMRC finally reclassifying bitcoin, I feel this this should be a positive move for bitcoiners in the UK.

Second time Ive ever used reddit tbh.
Thanks for the cross post.

Compared to prices for BT/Virgin/Talktalk residential broadband sure, but thats not comparable to our business orientated services.
While these are residential products we offer, they are using the same business grade network as all our connections do.
Residential packages receive priority on the network between 8pm and midnight monday - friday, which make them ideal for hardcore gamers who make up the majority of our non business customers.

One day in the future perhaps, but for now regardless of payment method we're going to need exactly the same customer info as any other UK ISP.
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:55:15
Not sure whats wrong, I only use ipv6 to access my network and havent had any problems since it went live.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:30:42
Yes, we can offer colo in 8 datacentres around the UK.
We do not allow customer access to our data floors, so please get in touch to discuss your requirements.
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:20:07
All our connections include a single static IP as standard, and we can do larger blocks up to 64 IPs with proper justification (and over 16 ips RIPE application)
Regarding throttling etc,
Short answer, no artificial limits or caps.
Long answer: Bandwidth is unlimited, however is subject to our Traffic management policy:  and Acceptable Use Policy:

Entanet provide the upstream bandwidth.

Payments are processed automatically, via the Blockchain API.
Do you mean automatic 'cashing out' from BTC to fiat, or automation of the broadband signup process?
The latter I am currently working on.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:13:16
Depends on the product you want.
ADSL2 up to 1.3Mb standard, or up to 2.5Mb with annex M.
FTTC up to 2Mb standard, with 10Mb or 20Mb options depending on the package.
All of course are maximums and will be dependant on your line quality.

I have to say I am dead against any ISP being forced to essentially filter the internet. 
We will implement any filters, blocks, etc only when legally required to do so, and try to only store customer data and logs while they are relevant.
Users (Read: Parents) have had the tools to be able to protect their children from harm on the internet for decades, but many 
If customers wish to protect their children on the internet, there are many existing tools to enable that, such as routers from draytek eg:  or software like

WHMCS you mean?
Its done perfectly well for years, and I have no plans to change it.
The design I agree could use a little work, but I'm a service provider not an artist!
@_date: 2014-03-19 07:12:34
I fail to see how that is false advertising.
Managing the flow of traffic and limiting the amount you are able to use the service are totally different things.
Nowhere do we state that 'if you use X data in a month we will cap your service', except for customers on legacy products which had a defined limit.
That specific policy, as the document states, does not apply to customers on our Unlimited or LLU services. Unlimited packages are unlimited.
Instead we manage the flow of traffic to ensure that bulk downloads do not impede interactive traffic, and may terminate the accounts of customers found to be using the service for illegal purposes.
Did you even read the policy documents?
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:35:10
All the packages mentioned in this thread are unlimited.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:02:08
Generally up to 20Mb down for ADSL and up to 74Mb down for FTTC.
We can cover any WBC enabled exchange in the UK, However speeds and products available vary depending on the exchange, and your line length and quality.
This is why I'm working hard on getting a Line Checker active on the website today!
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:12:13
Speeds are great, when it works, and customer support I'm sure is fine, if you fall into the right flow chart that their multiple tiers of support staff use.
