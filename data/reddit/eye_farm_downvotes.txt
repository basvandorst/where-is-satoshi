Gold does have inherent value. It can be used as a paper weight, as jewelery, in chemical engineering, in computer chips.
You are right that nothing is priced in gold.
Lots of people own gold because it looks nice, or because it is a necessary component in their computer.

A commodity??? Wat
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:29:12
Fair point

Hmmm, I had not thought of this. Brb gonna make a post about how the price of gold is going to collapse.
No but really, i think bitcoin is significantly less appealing to the masses than gold. It is complicated and intangible. Gold is simple. It's shiny, heavy, useful, and a real thing.

Haha no worries. I'm borderline retarded. Thanks for your input though.

"A lot"
"Not a lot"
Pick one pls

Yeah I know what a commodity is but I fail to see how bitcoin is anything like one.

Because people are retarded idk. I gotta factor that into the equation i guess lmao

You are right that bitcoin is not inflationary. But that does not necessarily mean it is a viable currency or long term investment. 
Explain to me how a currency can be viable when nearly every person who owns it only owns it in hopes that its value will explode? Almost nobody actually uses bitcoin as a means of exchange. It is an investment that will only increase in value as more people buy into it. It is almost the dictionary definition of a pyramid scheme.

Haha I think ur right. I sold a bunch at $3925 and am too timid to reinvest. I just don't have very much confidence in it, but would hate to be left behind.

I ain't no scientologist. This here is just my speculation.

Wat. You can burn paper for heat. You can use it to wipe your ass. You can write on it. You can use it as wallpaper. Paper has inherent value... 
What can you do with a bitcoin if nobody wants it?

Right. It is a shiny rock that can be used, since it is a physical object. It has a plethora of potential purposes (always avoid alliteration). What can you do with a bitcoin if nobody wants it?

You are saying "would have" almost like you think it is over

Christ op. I haven't cringed this hard in a while. Thanks.
