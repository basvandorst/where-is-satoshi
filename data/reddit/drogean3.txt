its confirmed now, but this website allows you to push your transfers fast if they get stuck in limbo for too long  - very useful since it seems every single website and wallet except mycellium is putting in fees WAY TOO LOW

yeah its like getting a loan, but this stuff can be dangerous AF
its basically gambling, and its how people completely wipe out their money if they try to sell coins with leverage, and then the price goes UP
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:16:48
i would move to Gemini in a heartbeat if their graph didn't look like total shit
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:36:46
i hate  china so muchh
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:53:54
aw man
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:43:10
refresh the page, gdax requires you to refresh the entire page after an order is created/sold/cancelled/whatever
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:10:53
really lucky i got 4 bitcoins worth auto bought at 1000!
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:18:45
i set an auto buy on GDAX right before it froze and i got kicked off for 30 min for 4 btc at 1000 and 990, got 4 at 1000

@_date: 2017-03-03 17:54:57
um yeah because china dropped out of the markets, smart guy
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:46:52
dump it on coinbase, then transfer a few thousand to bank weekly
spend it on a new boat
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:14:11
gdax down!!!
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:17:15
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:19:50
everyone has something similar set up (maybe not 1100), while simultaneously coming here and posting "HODL!! HODL!!" like a bunch of tards
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:21:47
eh, gemini took like a week to verify all my id's and shiz so i could even buy
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:56:11
all exchanges require a drivers license picture uploaded, then you need to connect it to your bank account to withdraw USD
theres no way coinbase or any exchange can track how much the bitcoin was purchased at, so its all tax free
any kid with those 2 things dont need parents permission
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:20:29
GDAX login is hosed but its not reflecting on the site
fuck man everyone is trading except me!!!
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:25:59
dont think you can short on gdax so it looks like he fuxed himself
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:20:37
no but the CHINESE MIGHT PANIC SELL TONIGHT
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:50:47
good catch, definitely code for something
maybe it means 3pm ANNOUNCEMENT, BITCOIN is GOOD TO GO
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:50:02

@_date: 2017-03-15 17:37:48
i have zero issues with uphold, its fast as fuq and stays up when coinbase doesnt
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:41:24
uphold.com was instant verification for me, limit is $500 worth a day with CC or bank acct
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:24:46
they are a trading market , so instant purchase not really
you gotta move your money over and then buy, prob a few business days to ACH transfer
@_date: 2017-03-31 02:37:23
this nigga needs to go, and yall need to stop posting his bullshiot here
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:21:27
uphold.com or coinbase.com
instant buy with a credit card
both will need you to upload a drives license i beleive
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:25:41
i want my CASH MONEY,
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:32:06

@_date: 2017-03-02 21:14:01
i'd move all my moneys to gemini if I knew they wouldnt send me any tax forms for dividends/winnings/income whatever
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:39:01
with CC its instant i believe, with bank account its 4 days
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:26:24
wtf man dont donate 10 coins
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:44:59
pretty sure everyone agrees China is the reason bitcoin was such shit for the last few months
no need to be "PC" about it
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:16:24
this right here is what we should be basing the market on
that yuan drop last night basically came right before the massive price drop
fucking chinese
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:00:36
you make sure to send a little something for transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:36:43
bitcoin used to take days to transfer, even now most sites report "30 minutes" while it takes up to 2 hours
you shouldn't have to increase the transaction fee if your website puts in a default
just gotta wait it out
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:32:10
nothing stopping you from controlling your keys after putting them in a blockchain wallet
way more secure than some janky app on your computer

I'm Johnny Noxville, and this is "INVESTING IN BITCOIN"
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:42:21
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:33:49
yeah the app is broken af
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:30:52
im not expert at all but i like to buy and sell on coinbase and keep my moneys in a 2 factor blockchain.info wallet - so far the easiest i've seen to get verified, buy coins with your bank/credit card instantly, and sell using the same account - only downside is its so popular it has been going down and up yesterday and today
at least for the USA
lots of other exchanges make it hard to move around money once it turns into USD
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:53:15
as a thousandare right now, this is funny
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:56:15
bitcoin times are totally off due to the popularity overnight
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:27:20
we laugh but he was right ALL ALONG!!!
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:32:32
also that china makes the rules here
now I completley understand what Trump meant when he said they manipulated their currnecy, one look at their exchange rate and it looks shady as fuccck 
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:58:57
you gotta be doing something crazy because my BOA account has never been flagged for any of this stuff
you arent telling us the whole story
probably moving massive amounts of money
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:50:52
when it goes up and down 100-200 dollars a day, its a stock
until china stops manipulating it at the drop of a hat - its a stock
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:30:20
its GOING EVEN LOWER!!! 785!!
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:10:20
very useful, thanks
now i know to just monitor the chinese yuan value
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:57:09
its because they can
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:56:25
more like, sell now, watch it crash to nothing AGAIN, then buy it up when its low
im trying to figure out how to sell my shit now since i bought in at 600 a few years ago
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:27:11
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:59:43
try uphold they are like a better coinbase
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:22:48
not here
maybe you bought 7,450k worth of bitcoin this week
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:01:29
and on top of that, that the chinese yuan is totally manipulated - just like Trump has been saying
now we're seeing it first hand
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:45:33
bro u VIRTUE SIGNALING?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:49:34
they also bitcoin a 8949 in psd format filled in if you choose
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:26:39
coinbase introduced secure offline vaults today - can't really think of any reason for a ledger if you're using 2FA now
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:35:34
they have buttons that literally import your entire trade histories from the site with a couple clicks, nobody is putting them in manually
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:10:58
if its not segwit, i dont want it
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:43:09
ARISE CHUKUN!!!
