The argument isn't that bitcoin solves the problem in Greece. The argument is that most people don't understand how money works and the Greece situation shines some light on it.

Thanks for the feedback, and please keep it coming!
There is a benefit to creating a Coinbase wallet for the button, which is enabling off-blockchain transactions which are truly free and instantaneous. At the moment, on-blockchain txn fees can take a high percentage of a 300 bit tip.
But we also love the open nature of bitcoin and hope to add bitcoin address functionality at some point .

thanks Ken, great points. I think the psychological barrier is primarily a result of the friction and once that is reduced, the behavior will become more common. Digital currencies like bitcoin and others are easier and cheaper to use, and I expect that to enable micropayments to take off. Looking forward to checking out Anderson's book!

I wrote the piece. I love the dogecoin community. Dogecoin users are incredibly inclusive and have done a great job attracting different demographics (women, non-techies) to digital currencies. Its one of the alt coins I think has a real shot for just that reason.
A community needs more than just users to have long-term success though. Doge is less than 6 months old and doesn't yet have the developers, miners, investors, and merchants that it will need to have long-term success.

I think that initially this is going to only be for a subset of consumers like myself who views eating meals as more of a nuisance than anything else. I don't like to eat and would love to be able to get all the nutrients I need as efficiently as possible.

Nick from Coinbase here. I helped lead our tip button launch. We wanted to provide a way for our ~1.9M users to tip content creators in one-click and saw a real need for one-click tipping functionality. We've been encouraged by the initial response, but we have a long ways to go to making bitcoin micropayments mainstream. 
Huge fan of ChangeTip as well and think they are an incredibly valuable service in the bitcoin ecosystem. It's the easiest possible way to spread bitcoin to new users on social platforms via text and myself and a bunch of the team use it!

Coinbase calculates the USD conversion rate by looking at a number of exchanges which we view as liquid and credible. The rate that you see on the site is the price that we lock in for you as a merchant.
Coinbase is free for the first $1M instantly converted and after that, there is a 1% instant conversion fee. So for the first $1M instantly converted, if a Wikipedia donor donates $1000, you will get $1000 credited to your bank account. After $1M instantly converted, you will get $990 credited to your account for every $1000 donated.

to be clear, this is not something that Coinbase is pushing on people. this is one unit that people can use. if you don't want to use it you don't have to, and ultimately the market will decide which unit to use

No wars, we all need to grow this together. ChangeTip uses the Coinbase API and we are huge fans (and users) of what they are building.
The reality is that tipping is still very far from a mainstream behavior, and there is a need for both a service that integrates on social platforms and makes it easy to tip with text, and a tool that enables one-click tipping for content. If this market works, there will be many winners.

Thanks for the love guys. It's because of you that big merchants like Time and all the other big names this year have integrated bitcoin into their businesses.

Thanks for the feedback on our tip button. Some thoughts on the 300 bit default tip amount...
The default  is designed so that users think of the button as more of a "FB like" than making a payment like they've historically thought about making a payment online. We're trying to reduce the mental transaction costs of micropayments that Nick Szabo has written a lot about. 
10 cents is something you don't have to think twice about-- if you like the content, you will click the button and contribute to the creator. We think this is pretty powerful. Users can change the amount in settings, but the majority of users are tipping that amount thus far and its working pretty well so far.
@_date: 2014-11-19 04:48:11
the micropayments channel implementation in BitcoinJ is super interesting long-term. I  think there will be a time/place for both centralized and decentralized services

keep in mind though, that these numbers are only aggregating on-blockchain statistics. So a coinbase user that purchases from a coinbase merchant would not count as an active node, and the transaction would not be calculated in the blockchain transaction count (because coinbase-coinbase transaction are off-blockchain).

not telling people to buy bitcoin, just explaining why it should be on US consumers radar. Right now, bitcoin is much more relevant to international consumers who would rather store their wealth in a currency based on math rather than a currency based on a centralized body of people making decisions. I do not think that is a reason US consumers should care, but I do think it will be a very attractive way for consumers to save on price.

Thanks, interesting points on ChangeTip. I'm a big fan of their product as well and I think there are benefits to both applications. Personally, I prefer the convenience of BitTip (you can tip in two clicks), which to me is much easier than writing out "1 upvote". 
There's also more friction associated with getting bitcoin onto a Changetip account. Why buy bitcoin with Coinbase, and then send it to my ChangeTip account, only to lead to a less convenient tipping experience? I prefer to simply auth BitTip to pull funds from my Coinbase account when I want to tip folks.

Nick from Coinbase here. Just want you to know that many of us at Coinbase care about privacy as much as you do. As many from the community have highlighted in other threads, the fact that we are a highly scrutinized and regulated bitcoin service means that there are situations where we have to step in when we observe illegal activity on our platform. If we didn't do this, we wouldn't be able to deliver on our mission of making bitcoin simple to use for mainstream consumers and businesses.
It's a bummer to hear you're leaving, but thanks for being a customer for two years! If you have any ideas re: privacy, would love to hear them. This year we made some positive strides in the direction of user privacy by adding multi-sig wallets. It is my hope that we will make further strides in the future.

Fair. My take away was that the business is focused on providing infrastructure for financial services. There's clearly money to be made there given all of the interest from the industry, and it's not outside the realm of possibility that the most secure, decentralized infrastructure ultimately wins over other projects like R3. 
Regarding how exactly the company is making money now - that's not as interesting to me but the primary biz models for open-source businesses are consulting and services fees and premium products and I'm guessing that there's significant opps for Blockstream there.

The reality is that most people don't want to get paid in bitcoin right now for their existing work because of the volatility and speculative nature of btc. 
These examples we highlighted are tasks that anyone can do to earn bitcoin and they're all tasks that you couldn't really make money from before. People are willing to take bitcoin for these tasks because there is no alternative. I think this is an important aspect of getting bitcoin in the hands of more people.

Storj seems interesting, but I'd characterize it as a blockchain app rather than a bitcoin app. This list is focused on applications for peer-to-peer cash, which is what I'd call the first clear application of the blockchain.

Agreed, you should definitely take my thoughts with a grain of salt as well.
Fwiw, me leaving had nothing to do with my outlook on the company. Coinbase is the leading brand in digital currencies and will continue to be that. The company is filled with great people who have collectively done more to push digital currency forward than any group in the world.
Pitting Bitcoin and Ethereum up against each other is a false dichotomy though. They're different digital currency platforms that serve different purposes. And motivation in so strongly pitting them up against each other likely stems from a short-term focus rather than long-term focus, imho.

Thanks for highlighting this point. I wasn't arguing that bitcoin is not fungible and I should probably edit to "each bitcoin wallet has its own unique, traceable history." I also definitely wasn't arguing that bitcoin associated with particular addresses should be treated different than other bitcoin. 
I would just say that bitcoin is slightly less fungible than USD or gold in that it can be tracked to particular addresses, so it could be interpreted as different by some people. I agree with you though that this may not matter long-term with Coinjoin and other mixing solutions.

This is awesome. We're excited to work on more integrations like this where consumers can benefit from the efficiencies of Bitcoin without worrying about the volatility of the currency. 
There is a passionate and growing number of people that want to own bitcoin because they believe in it for a variety of reasons.

This integration appeals to the second type of person and we hope to do many more of these in the future.

Welcome to the bitcoin community Senator Moran. The governments openness to bitcoin thus far has made me more optimistic about the future of the US than ever. 
I'm currently a Yale business school student and over the past six months I have engaged with many merchants about bitcoin in hopes of understanding it better from a payment processing perspective. The vast majority of merchants I have spoken with have immediately grasped the value of bitcoin as a payment protocol. The significantly lower transaction fees and the instantaneous, irreversible nature of bitcoin are the most compelling aspects from a merchants perspective.

In addition to the attractive sharpe ratio, the correlation of monthly returns between the S&amp;P 500 and bitcoin from 8/31/2010 to present is -.22469. A high sharpe ratio, combined with negative correlation, is likely to make bitcoin an extremely attractive asset class to large institutional investors in the near future. It is a small sample size, and at current market value, bitcoin is too small for most endowments and large institutional investors to get involved, but this is another thing bitcoin has going for it long term, IMO.
