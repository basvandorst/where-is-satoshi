I don't see any real technical reason why we can't eventually have a "milli-satoshi" unit, if it becomes necessary. Yes, it'd involve a hard-fork, but it's entirely feasible.

I would say it is mainly of benefit if you are someone who has a lot of BTC. Converting BTC into fiat can be time consuming, and incurs fees, so it's preferable to spend it directly. Since most people still can't pay their rent or utility bills in BTC, they may wish to save their dollars for these purposes, and spend BTC where they can.
In other words, if you bought or mined BTC when price/difficulty was low, and now you want to get some value out of them, it can make more sense to spend them on stuff you want/need than to convert them into fiat currency.

I believe the planned initial implementation is to calculate the smartfee for a transaction, and also calculate the fee under the old system, and use whichever is the LARGER amount.

Technically, yes. For practical purposes a "bad" passphrase is any phrase which an attacker will try - any passphrase which appears in any of the lists used by attackers. Disregarding the fact that you've just mentioned it here, "Rhubarb Ladyboy Gastrocnemius Orange Strawberry Carrot" is *probably* not a bad passphrase by that definition, but it almost certainly was influenced by your biases, conscious or unconscious. An attacker could use their knowledge of you, or of human biases in general, to try and narrow down their search parameters. Using a random generator allows you to make sure there is no possible personal or general bias in your selection.
It is of course *possible* that a truly random pick of six words could result in a common phrase or quotation or title, but the chances or vanishingly remote. In the truly extraordinary situation that your generator were to spit out "Tis a pity she's a whore" or "Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back" or "badger badger badger badger badger badger", you should just generate another.

@_date: 2015-08-14 11:24:35


How did I overstate it? I was pretty clear that I was talking purely about randomly selected words. If you narrow it down to just grammatically-correct and/or meaningful sentences, of course that reduces the entropy. Personally, I would say it's better to have some random words and commit them to memory or make up a mnemonic than to choose something (non-random) which is memorable. You don't actually need six words, even just four or five (from a large wordlist) should be sufficient.
@_date: 2015-08-14 10:53:30
Assuming the passphrase (or entropy used to generate it) wasn't leaked somehow, and it's not a common phrase or quotation, it should be extremely secure. 6 random\* words from a comprehensive English (or any other) dictionary would be nigh on impossible to brute-force. 
On a stock Ubuntu:
    $ wc -l /usr/share/dict/british-english
    99156 /usr/share/dict/british-english
(and there are much longer wordlists available.) So with 99,156 words, stringing six random words together, there are 99156^6, or about 950 octillion, possible combinations. Let's generously assume an attacker with a huge hashing farm can check a billion of these six-word-strings every second. It'd still take them over 30 trillion years to check every possible passphrase.
EDIT: \*I said *random*. As in `$ shuf -n 6 /usr/share/dict/words`
If you make a brainwallet and do it stupidly, like don't use a random generator to pick your passphrase, or use a guessable phrase, then obviously it's not secure. That doesn't mean brainwallets are insecure, it means stupidity is insecure.

I'm not totally clear on the script specification, but the [wiki]( is a bit ambigous about whether a NO_OP1-10 makes a transaction invalid.
You'd just need to convert your payload into decimal, it's not very space efficient but it's cheaper than using the amount of coins, and should allow for longer messages. Does the protocol impose any limit in the size of the script for a transaction? Again, the [wiki]( says not.

You'd have to be one of the nodes connected to that IP when they broadcast a transaction. If your client receives a transaction which isn't in the current block, there is a chance that the IP which sent it to you is that of the client which signed the transaction. However, I'm not sure if it is possible to tell whether it was just rebroadcasted from another node.

The problem is that without an up-to-date blockchain, the client cannot know your wallet balance. The balance is just the sum of all the transactions for all the addresses in that wallet. So, if not all transactions are known, the client can't know that you have money to spend. Technically, it could try to send bitcoins, but it might end up sending coins which you have already spent, resulting in an invalid transaction which other clients would reject. Therefore, any sensible client should refuse to send bitcoins without a complete blockchain.

I'm wondering precisely how a government could go about regulating bitcoin. They could try and stamp it out entirely, by legislating to criminalise it, but if they didn't, what regulatory measures could they actually take? I guess they could pass laws to regulate exchanges and online wallets, at least ones that operate in their territory. If a govt. passed laws requiring such service providers to have independent security audits, I'd actually be quite pleased.
Would they perhaps levy a special tax on bitcoins?
Try to insist people register their addresses with tax authorities? How would they enforce that?
But unless they invest in their own mining farms, they just don't control the money supply or the blockchain. Isn't bitcoin rather intrinsically resistant to regulation?
@_date: 2012-01-24 10:49:51
The problem with reforming the email system, is it has a huge installed base, and is very resistant to change. For this system to be at all effective, we need the vast majority of email users/providers to adopt it. Otherwise, it is necessary to remain backwards compatible with standard email, meaning that spammers will simply send you normal email.
If I had the ability to massively reform the email network and protocols, I'd just bake in key and message signing so that you can trace an email back to its sender. If enough rounds were required for signing, it could itself become computationally intensive enough to discourage sending thousands at a time.

It seems to me this new market would have much worse problems than the problems of existing medicine, without really alleviating any of those existing problems.


The consequences of being scammed on a darknet market are that you will lose money or receive inferior goods. Worst case is that you'll get arrested. The worst-case consequences of being scammed by a doctor are that you will die.


Is this an actual problem? Doctors being sued by their colleagues or pharma suppliers? I recognise that "Big Pharma" often puts undue pressure on doctors, but usually through financial incentives, free gifts, attractive reps, etc. That's not something a free market would improve (quite the opposite.) I've never heard of doctors being sued by pharmaceutical companies because they didn't prescribe their drugs, perhaps this is an American problem I'm unaware of?


I would massively disagree that an internet reputation system could be better than actual medical qualifications, or even that it's viable. Those kind of systems are notoriously easy to game, especially when they are designed to be anonymous. How do you know that a good review/rating was actually written by a patient, and not the doctor themselves? Do you really trust these ratings given by laypeople anyway? What if a patient gives a good rating initially, and later suffers complications due to incorrect treatment? What about all those people who had reason to give bad ratings? What restitution do they get for being treated incorrectly?
You suggested that doctors without a reputation would give out free consultations/treatments in order to acquire one. If some of those doctors get positive feedback and are proved trustworthy, some of them must get negative feedback. In order for this system to work, some patients will have to take one for the team in order to identify bad or unethical practitioners.

You can still transfer coins, you still have a bitcoin address for the wallet, but you control it, not the ewallet provider


That's just what I was suggesting.
The key doesn't have to be a whole hundred+ digit private key, it could just be a passphrase, say 32 characters; easy enough to remember a sentence of half a dozen words and still quite hard to break. To trade on your phone or tablet or in a cybercafe or whatever, all you need is that key. Everything else is in the cloud.

This sounds like a horrible idea to me. Probably worth noting that I'm from the UK, so the idea of directly paying for healthcare is pretty alien to me anyway.
* There's no protection against malpractice aside from "the free market." It's not much consolation that you gave the doctor a bad review.
* Patients will simply shop around looking for a diagnosis or treatment they like, rather than a correct or efficacious one. Doctors who give valid medical advice which is hard to hear (e.g. lose weight and stop drinking or you'll die of a heart attack) will get bad feedback, while doctors who enable their patients will get good feedback.
* It will attract huge numbers of quacks, who will thrive without regulation.
* Doctors can't be sued. I'm not sure why you list this point as if it's a benefit.
* Doctors would be operating without any kind of ethical supervision. This opens the door to all kinds of misbehaviour, for example running clinical trials without informed consent or proper oversight. 
* How do you even know the person giving you advice *is* a doctor, or what their qualifications are? If the site is anonymous like Silk Road, there'd be no way to verify their credentials.
There's no way in hell I'd use a site like this.

My understanding is that a confirmation means a transaction has been recorded in a block, which are generated only every ~10 minutes. So on average you need to wait something like 5 minutes.

I didn't say value, I said worth. 1 bitcoin is definitely *worth* around £10, because it can readily be exchanged for about £10. Whether it will continue to be worth something I can't say.

Looking at [this]( page, it says you can do an "instant" domestic wire transfer if you live in one of the listed countries, one of which is "Latvia (European Union!)"

It doesn't quite work like that. Bitcoin doesn't use any encryption, just signing and hashing. There is no encryption to break.
Regarding signing, if you were able to reverse-engineer someone's private key from their bitcoin address, you could steal all their money. But there is no known way to do this even with a dozens of supercomputers.
Regarding hashing, if you could come up with an algorithm which could generate a hash with a certain number of leading zeros, you could mine as many blocks as you wanted almost at once. However, again, there isn't a way to do this, and a supercomputer is unlikely to help you find one.

What's with the massive heatsink - you planning on doing CPU mining?
@_date: 2011-06-25 06:02:54


Difficulty is calculated by a deterministic algorithm every 10(?) blocks. The idea is for one block to be found every ten minutes. So, if the average time for a block to be found was more than 10 mins, the difficulty goes down. Otherwise it goes up. If you throw a load of computing power into the network, difficulty will rise, but if you take it away again the difficulty will self-correct.
You can't "screw up" the system unless you are trying to (or have a bug in your miner/client) other than raising the difficulty. If you were malicious, and your computing power was equal to or greater than the combined power of the rest of the network you could "outvote" everyone else as to the validity of a given block, allowing you to do some double spending.

They aren't really courting potential attackers, they are just trying to sweeten the pot a little for coders and security professionals doing code review.

These days, most supercomputers include GPUs. Because they are an order of magnitude faster than CPUs for certain kinds of calculations. The same architecture that makes them good at mining makes them good at scientific calculations.

To be honest, I never did understand what service ewallet sites provide. Isn't being able to access your funds from anywhere basically the only advantage? That's why I proposed this system as an alternative way to get that benefit without ceding control of your money.

You could install a portable bitcoin client on a usb stick, but still keep the wallet elsewhere in case it gets stolen. There's nothing wrong with your solution either, but you do need a machine running at home. Not a problem if you're running a miner or something anyway.
Out of interest, do you have some kind of web gui to access your bitcoin client, or do you just use the raw JSON interface?

What's with the casual racism?
EDIT: I'm not a fan of confrontation, so I didn't want to be the one to take issue with this. I was astonished no one else had called you out on this, so I posted a one-line comment hoping to trigger a discussion (which I think is better than just me ranting.) But that didn't work, so here goes:


Firstly, stereotyping all bankers as Jewish or all Jews as bankers is both unhelpful and offensive. Second, by implying that a "Jewish bank" gives you a poor ROI (do gentile banks give better rates of interest?), you invoke the "Jews are mean" stereotype, which is up there with "black people are criminals", "Hispanics are lazy" or "Americans are stupid."
You make a perfectly sensible, well thought out comment, and then threw in a racial slur. Including the word "Jewish" added nothing at all to your post, except causing offence to a bunch of people, me included.
Fuck you.

OK, lets say I lend you £100 at an interest rate of -1% per annum. After a year, the interest comes to -£1, so now you owe me only £99. After two years, you owe me £98.01, and so on. Every year, your debt will get smaller, until you owe me something like a penny. In effect, I have given you £100 for free. Even if you did actually make some repayments, say because you were contractually obliged to, I would still have lost money. There is no situation in which it would be in anyone's interest to lend money at negative interest.
If cash supply was really that low, then you might see things like more fees for cash withdrawals, or bigger discounts for paying in cash, or higher fees for paying with credit, but not loans at negative interest.

What's the point of deploying lots of nodes when they are mostly on the same networks? According to your FAQ, you only use Linode and Digital Ocean. Having more than one node on the same network won't really do much to help the bitcoin network, it'd be better to just have one node and increase its bandwidth (and number of bitcoin network connections) and processing.

So how are these offline snapshots distributed?
EDIT: Thinking about it, I would say distribution is the easiest thing to solve about this idea (see replies.) However:
How does one verify a transaction? In order to ensure that a transaction is valid, a client needs the full details of that transaction - inputs, outputs, scripts, nonce, hash, etc. So for any transaction I am interested in, I must both download the hash from the blockchain, and obtain the "offline" version of the full transaction from somewhere else. The only alternative is to trust some third-party to tell me that a transaction is valid, because they have the full data and have verified it for me. This introduces centralisation.
So essentially, we have a system where we have a blockchain, which stores only outputs and hashes, and another DHT-type system which stores the rest of the data. To do anything useful, we have to download both. How has this helped us?

I was talking to my dad about bitcoin recently. He's not a computer illiterate, but he's not hugely tech-savvy either. However, he does know a fair bit about economics; he plays the stock market, reads the financial times and so forth.

He's written a book which I'm going to e-publish, and he readily agreed to accept bitcoin payments.

So could any kind of hosting provider - even if it isn't virtualised, they have physical access to the disk. The same applies to storing any kind of valuable data at a 3rd-party datacentre.
However, I take your point: right now, there are no coins in the wallet, it's primarily so I have a bitcoind instance to test against. When I get into production, I may use some kind of e-wallet, but in any event, bitcoins would pass through the wallet only briefly - there would never be a large balance stored there.
But there are still reasons to run a bitcoin node even if the wallet balance is zero, such as having direct access to the blockchain. I could accept payments to an offline wallet, and use the VPS bitcoind to monitor that wallet's balance.

In theory, both LastPass and Clipperz are "host-proof." They don't actually know your password, and cannot access your password database. They only have an encrypted copy of it, which is decrypted client side by javascript in your browser. It is fairly simple to verify this by watching the traffic from your computer - if you see your password being sent down the wire, you know something dodgy is happening.
Also, LastPass may not be open source, but the client-side code is all readable, and AFAIK not obfuscated.
