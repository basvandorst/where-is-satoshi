I know, right? It very well may be an empty one for all I know. Or have around 1btc in it. But I already feel unsafe having uploaded it to so many places.

why should I NOT get it back if it's available?

Ohh wait... are you saying "my cow died, let's kill the neighbor's too!"
No, if he can refund my bitcoins I deposited earlier that day, that would be completely fair! He should do it, there is not reason that I know of why he should not.

Let me tell you guys: it has been a scam from the beginning. The only people getting rich are the early ones - and by early ones I mean those who were there before 2011\*. I got 30 btc in 2011, when they were worth $10 each, and I got them for free. I don't consider myself an early adopter still. Sold a few years later. Why did I not hold? Because it has been obvious that it had no real market besides "dark" transactions. It is very easy to manipulate the market if you have control over let's say 1 million btc, or roughly 20% of all coins in circulation (not counting lost ones).
Accept the fact. It will not recover, there is no future for this. sadface
I really just come read these threads and also on /biz to have a good laugh at people sitting up for this scam and getting fckd. the big holders are unloading as we speak. there will be no "recovery". so...

sure, sure. I also lost some that I got from the faucet when it was giving away 5 BTC at the time. Later it was only 1 I think. Ofc you wouldn't know what that was. It was a good scam, probably the biggest the world has ever seen
