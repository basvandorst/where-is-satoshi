That's interesting, thanks for the info. I wasn't around when that happened, no. I decided to not pay too much attention since the bear market started in 2018. Thought the bear market would be easier to handle that way, especially since I wasn't going to sell anything, no matter what happened. I've been subscribed to some crypto subs, but I have barely paid any attention to them.
I don't think BCH ever was a contender in terms of taking over BTC's market cap, but they may carve out their own part of the market. BTC and BCH forked, and it didn't really affect BTC. Forking in itself shouldn't really affect them, unless there's something I'm missing.
About the bug though, that's another story. BTC had a bug a long time ago, maybe in 2009. I think people will eventually forget about it, but since there's a lot more competition now, it could have a noticeable effect. I think people being greedy, makes them more willing to forgive and forget these kinds of things.

Yeah, I've noticed that. Assuming the bull truly is back on, I expect Bitcoin to lead the market, at least to begin with (though I could be wrong, of course). After that, who knows what happens.

Could you elaborate what you mean by civil war? Haven't heard anything about that (unsurprisingly).

Haven't paid particular attention to crypto in a while. Have there been any significant changes to Bitcoin in 2018 - today? I'm thinking of the technology itself, not price. Things that could change transactions per second, fees, speed, etc.

That's a bit disappointing, I'll be honest. Do you know if there's anything interesting happening in the near future?
