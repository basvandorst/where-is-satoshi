Rogue developers are also an issue.  They could make use of the network for their users while ignoring promoted messages and displaying their own.
Twister is not going to work because of its flawed economic model.  There are FAR better ways to reward miners for a service like this.

Oh I know. But his sentence sets up a comparison.
    It gets exponentially harder as you go from 1 to 100 then 100 to 1000.  
would be proper use of a progression.
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:16:42
Note that I agreed with your original point, but gramatically if you want to use a progression you'll need to rewrite your sentence to something like:
    It gets exponentially harder as you go from 1 to 100 then 100 to 1000. 
But to say "it is harder," you'll need to say what it is harder than.
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:15:36
this is not 5 minutes old.  I read the proposal a while back, and yeah, I'm going to say that using "promoted messages" as the reward for securing the proof-of-work chain isn't going to fly because users have NO INCENTIVE to honor promoted messages at all.  
Thats not an indictment of the *concept* of p2p social networking/microblogging, but it is a major flaw in twister as implemented.
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:31:03
Its not a progression it is a comparison.   
In your example, 
    I went to the mall, then the movies.
"then" combines the sentences into a progression:
    I went to the mall
    then
    I went to the movies
BUT. In your original sentence it is a comparison of the differing hardness between 1-100 and 100-1000.  
    it's exponentially more hard 
    to have it go from $1 to $100
    than
    to have it go from $100 to $1000
regardless, your original point is 100% valid.   You can't say that 1-&gt;100 is as easy as 100-&gt;1000.

@_date: 2014-01-13 18:01:25
That may be part of it sometimes, but its not the whole picture.
So in the case of things like... the latest Ubuntu ISO, bittorrent can be seen as a means of donating bandwidth to a project you want to support.  Same goes with any CC licensed media.  This is the "sense of higher purpose" I was talking about.  The raw protocol itself however, works from a more "egalitarian" standpoint:

No I comprehend it just fine.  exponential growth gets progressively more difficult to maintain.  But grammatically, its still incorrect.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:45:35
you've dropped a verb to make the sentence correct w/o a conjunction.


 has 3 verbs:  is, have, go.   "is" is part of the independent clause,  have is in its prepositional infinitive form, but... "go" exists without a conjunction.  
As, than, because, while, when, could all be used.

EXACTLY THIS.
In order to have a proof-of-work blockchain, you need people willing to do the work.
To make people willing to do the work, you need rewards that play to their a) greed, b) egalitarianism, c) sense of higher purpose.  
Bitcoin works because it plays to miner's greed and sense of higher purpose.  Bittorrent works because it plays to seeder's egalitarianism and sense of higher purpose. 
Twister, attempts to play into all three, but fails because it's predicated on the antiquated, centralized notion that clients and userbases can be exploited via advertisements.

Its a good start, but the rewards need to be different, and less spammy.

[Fiat according to Merriam Webster]( is:


Fiat itself is latin for "let it be done."
Bitcoin is not convertible into coin or specie of equivilent value.  bitcoin only exists by decree of the people "let it be done" and not by any intrinsic backing.
Its appropriate to refer to fiat when advocating for gold, because gold *is* specie and def not fiat.
However, when you refer to dollars/euros et al. as opposed to bitcoin, call them what they are: state sponsored currencies.

Voting comes with an entirely new set of problems than currency.
1) 1 Person 1 Vote.  This is similar to the double spending problem, but has the unique problem of requiring that you have some construct to link a person with an address/key...  Also, the system needs to be able to verify that that person is legally allowed to vote, and (if you turn this into a general election tool) who they can vote for (I can't vote in another State's senate race for example).
2) Secret Ballot.  Bitcoin operates with a public ledger.  That means I can dial up a certain address and see it's transactions.  This is a BAD THING for voting, because if I can prove to you whom I voted for, you could pay me to vote for someone.  That being said, it would be nice to be able to confirm that your vote was counted after the fact, even if you can't prove who it was for.
In summary, bitcoin really isn't designed for this and regardless, you would still need checks and balances in the meat space to confirm eligibility.  A simple prototype system for non-government votes (where secret ballot doesn't matter so much) could probably be implemented pretty easily...  
Its a fascinating idea,  but a VERY VERY difficult one.

Right... but difficulty scales with hashing power, and reward levels decay, so it takes vastly more energy per bitcoin created now than it did two years ago.  
When I say "Payment processing network" that includes mining.
Because the Payment processing network/mining cloud is decentralized, there's no way of knowing how energy efficient each miner is, nor the source of that energy, nor the efficiency of that source, nor the cabon output of that source, nor the carbon costs for creating that source of energy.  
So there's no way to calculate "Carbon footprint of a bitcoin."  
This is not dissimilar to saying that there's no way of calculating the carbon footprint of an MP3.  Or...  What is the carbon footprint of this .Gif ?

Correct. Bitcoin-as-a-network is *mostly* distributed.  One could make an argument that mining pools and thin clients have a decentralizing effect on the "software network" a bit. 
Bitcoin-as-an-ecosystem is decentralized.  Bitcointip, blockchain.info, mtgox, coinlab, bitpay, the Bitcoin Foundation etc etc are all part of this decentralized "services network."
What you're proposing is the [hydra approach that thePirateBay recomended](  This isn't a bad thing, and in fact seems to be fairly successful.
*BUT*  I've currently been fascinated with the increased resiliency of *distributed* networks.  TOR, Freenet, Bitcoin, bitmessage.  
What I really think we need is a distributed communications platform slash social network wherein users can publicly post code bounties, or exchange offers, or securely communicate.
Until someone makes that undertaking however, I guess you're right: increasing the services in a decentralized manner is the best option.

It *IS* a silly question, because bitcoins are units of account... pure information.   If the mining/payment processing cloud ceased all operations (which would mean 0 carbon emissions),  the blockchain and bitcoins would still exist (transactions would not). 
You're trying to ask what the carbon emissions are of somehting that doesn't intrinsically emit carbon. 
Furthermore, if you were to ask a not-silly question, like "what is the carbon footprint of the mining/payment processing cloud?"  
That'd be like asking what is the carbon footprint of XBox live.  Or, what is the carbon footprint of webbrowsing, or what is the carbon footprint of the users of Microsoft word.
You can zoom in on a individual miner and probably get the answer, but as you increase scope, you'll have less and less of an assurance of validity, a huge margin of error, AND your calculation is transient because the energy usage of the payment processing cloud is constantly in flux.
Here's the equation:
    (Pt - Pr) * E(ave)
    Pt = total power
    Pr = renewable power
    E(ave) = average efficiency
You cannot get Pt within a reasonable margin of error, because you only know hashing power, and you can't conduct a thorough enough survey.  You could probably make an educated guess as to an average Hash/watt...  but without knowing a margin of error, you're still just guessing.
Pr is even more unknowable than Pt.  Sure there may be some people running a miner on solar power, BUT for all the miners plugged into the grid, how can they know what % of their power comes from coal plants, and what percent comes from nuclear plants, and what percent comes from windfarms?
E(ave) is the *most* unknowable.  What is the carbon/watt of your home's electrical grid connection?  How much of the power do you receive come from carbon producing sources? What is the carbon/watt of those sources?  Do they fluctuate?  
Its a silly question.  We can discuss carbon footprints of power plants, of manufactured items, of plants, of cars etc.  But calculating the carbon footprint of a bunch of devices that run on electricity?  Its kinda silly.

a lot more work has been done than you think.


Seriously, you don't need GPS sats.  A radio beacon on the habitat would be enough to direction find from an excursion.  furthermore, astrophysicist Zubrin has already designed a method of orienteering via the stars on mars. 
you don't really need weather sats.  all habs and equipment should be weatherized all the time. 
We already have comms established with our rovers.  should be sufficient for a while, but we may need more eventually,  but without any serious atmospheric attenuation, there's no reason a ground based dish couldn't supplement bandwidth.


No. thats a bad idea.  waaay to much radiation for people.  ISS is partially protected by Earth, but that wouldn't be the case for a martion station. Plus, there are NO resources in space, whereas there's quite a bit on the surface.


Alot of this can be teleworked from earth.  furthermore, a few pioneers could potentially leverage robots (like, an excavator to start with) to multiply their capabilities.  Look at what we're doing with our current rovers, programing a set of commands into them and letting them do it.  Now apply that to excavating, mining, etc.


Nah.  eventually yes, but after the first batch of colonists need not be that big. 


1) in situ resource utilization.  send an automated hab first w/ a hydrogen feedstock that begins sucking in CO2 fromt the atmo and through a series of chemical reactions produces O2, H2O and methane.   again, Zubrin, Case for Mars
2) Mars to Stay.  There's no real imperitive for an escape plan.  its not required to get skilled people there.


Thats because you're conception of this is far too extravagant. you have tons of stuff thats not really useful. a doctor? really?  what a waste. just teach people first aid and add medical supplies. there's no diseases... a space station for...  nothing really?  GPS for turn by turn navigation? LOL.  But in all seriousness it will be on the order of billions.  but its not as unattainable as you make it out to be. 


Thankfully, others do and are actively working towards it as a goal.


I'm willing to bet money that you're wrong.

So if we assume that renewable energy use in the mining cloud is negligible, we still have to figure our the carbon footprint of a watt.   Which can change radically based on where that watt is consumed.  A watt from a nuke plant will have a much lower carbon footprint than a watt from a coal plant.   A coal plant in one regulatory environment will have a (could be vastly) different carbon footprint than one in another.   
The minimum carbon footprint is 0, as the mining cloud does not need to consume carbon fuels at all.

People take that kind of risk all the time here on earth.  Hikers, explorers, etc.     The only sickness you'll get in space/mars, will be radiation sickness, and that doesn't require a doctor.   A doctor is literally a waste of air and resources.  Theres a story of a young medic on a submarine who ghetto rigged an appendectomy.  No reason why an engineer or scientist could not preform a surgery, especially if there's documentation on board (and/or the patient can wait 4h for round trip comms to earth).  The first batch of colonists don't need a doctor.  Ones the population increases, a doctor is reasonable but at first, a complete waste to have someone whos only job is to poke, prod, and not contribute to the task at hand.


It absolutely is.  A medic today has vastly more knowledge than say... a civil war doctor.  


again, while the science is valuable (and already being preformed by some of our mars orbiters,  the "early warning system" is useless, as everything *must* be weather hardened anyway.


You misunderstand, our rovers comm to an orbiter who comms earth.  we can use that same system for planetside humans to earth comms.  The current rovers'll be junk by the time humans arrive even at the most optimistic time frames.


Ok, so two issues here: 1 locating and identifying resources (like, where's a cliff face to check stratifications, or, wheres that supply rocket) and 2 navigating.   For location and identification, we have excellent resolution sat maps already, and we'll continue to get more.   For navigation, we have the aforementioned maps,  a radio beacon on the hab (where's home?) the sun, and the stars.  Thats enough. we don't need a constellation of artificial satelites to begin colonizing. 


I'm not trolling.  Most of my assertions (no doc, in situ resources, navigation, radiation risks, feasibility) come from Zubrin's The Case For Mars... and I don't think trolls cite sources. 
One of the large unanswered questions is what effect the radiation during the 18mo transit will have on humans.  The surface has a higher ammount of radiation hitting the surface due to its lack of a atmosphere and magnetosphere (the ISS however is w/in the earths magnetosphere), so there's radiation risks all around.  On the surface at least you can use dirt to shield yourself.  
But ultimately, a martion space station is a dumb idea because there's no resources Nor value in mars orbit.


Until someone live's forever we'rd all on a suicide mission.  For some, the challenge and risks faced by colonizing another planet are acceptable for the reward of doing something monumental.   Many many many people have died for less awesome things.

@_date: 2013-11-14 18:02:12
Right. The dividends, overheads, and even markets are different. Also, burned/lost bitcoins still "contribute" to its calculated market capitalization.  
I'm not doing this for science or economics or to support any qualitative statement, this is all about psychology and propaganda. 
Setting Visa's market cap as the goal is as economically/scientifically meaningless as setting some round figure of USD.

IANAL, but I think your lawyers are only correct if its USD/BTC.
If it were LTC/BTC, torrent ratio/BTC,  or any other fungible digital good, the laws may be different.

bitcoin is fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:54:56
Yeah. seems we've had our language poisoned by gold-bug slang or something.

Guess it depends on when in the week he has to tell his boss.

I like that idea.  step the fee down for repeat customers in order to encourage those who aren't gonna chargeback.

to buy it.  the atm is operated by a different business than the manufacturer I believe

You can think that, but the bitcoin payment processing cloud *definately* orders compliance from nodes who want to participate.
They'll reject a large block,  they'll reject a faulty transaction etc.
There's no coercion, but that doesn't mean there aren't dictates.

shrugs.  I was just gonna offer you sever space... but if you're using wordpress.com already then it'd probably be more of a hassle than its worth for either of us.
I got no recommendations for domains.  I buy them in fiat too :/

by selling goods and services for BTC.
dont need a bank acct, exchange, or any third party save the btc payment processing network.

Or he measures value in BTC instead of purchasing power of BTC?

another useful phrase is "meshed out" used similarly to "zoned out" to describe someone engrossed in a screen.

do you know what folders are?

Supply is independent to demand.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:17:49
Yeah. So. How I break it down is thus:
Born prior to 1980: "GenX" and prior:  grew up without the internet
Born between 1980 and 1990:  "GenY":  grew up *along side* the internet
Born after 1990: "space whales": grew up *on* the internet
That sweet spot is because the internet grew right along side us.  I mean, I can remember being like...  whoa! this new CSS thing TOTALLY changes how to make websites...
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:58:40
Yeah.  Build something on the application/services layer instead of down in the protocol layer.
Like... bitpay.
