Well Technical analysis is the mathematical interpretation of fundamental analysis. It attempts to explain behavioural economics through recognized price movements on the basis that humans are hard wired to react in certain ways in different scenarios.
The concept is that if it has happened, or people have thought about it happening, it has been factored into the price... So in theory you don't need to worry about the IRS, China or anything, because somebody has already thought about it and it is priced into price action.
I agree with you to an extent. I think Bitcoin is too immature a market for TA but this is the first time that I have seen so many factors lined up.
Also, I would add that if Bitcoin does have a future as a currency it needs stability. Right now it behaving like a commodity.

I see your point but to play DevAdvo why would the 24/7 nature of bitcoin have an effect on them?
Candlesticks just tell you the Open, Close, High, Low - with a colour code for direction.
A candlestick on Wednesday afternoon is no different to one on Sunday morning so long as buyers and sellers are in the market?

I must confess, I like Max Keiser but he made me nervous about Bitcoin.

If I had coin and I was bidding, my opinion would have zero effect on the market. The truth is that the number of people who can move the market on their own could probably fit in a small room. 
I don't have to be a soldier to oppose war, or hold a season ticket to talk about a sports team.
The only part of what I wrote which was close to opinion was the interpretation of the IRS deal. However, I feel that the fact that you can be retrospectively taxed, and BTC being classified as property, not currency is a negative. This is why I never bought coin because it was obvious after the US Senate meeting what would follow. Japan are already regulating it like Gold and not a currency. 
I haven't said anything outlandish.
The rest is based in fact
Technical analysis is a chartered discipline with clearly defined parameters. It takes approximately 3 years to get qualified. Mine was a simple analysis because it is such an obvious set up. I passed it to my CMT colleague who confirmed the interpretation.
BTC wants to be a currency, and one of the key tenants of a currency is price stability. The wild price swings it has exhibited will be part of the reason that two of the worlds largest economies are regulating it as a commodity. 
Likely price stability at an arbitrary level now is the only way it could survive as a currency, because with each transaction being subject to capital gains, wild swings will net out its value as a medium of exchange.

Without doubt the biggest anti climax I've experienced on Reddit.
FX is OTC so there is no obligation for anyone to give anything.. It depends on your relationship with your dealer. 
Transferwise is a good company to check out, market rates small commission few.

Could you explain what caused you to come to that opinion?

Always want critical thinkers.

I'm quite sure that is not how it works. :)

Candlesticks are useful in some types of analysis in which the close price becomes the important point of analysis... Ie when Bitcoin closed below 500 61.8% fib ret level, theoretically it became quite likely that we could see $100 again. 
We had huge support at 400 before and if we close below that on a daily candlestick I'd say $100 is likely again.

Happy to, might as shut down the sub in that case.
