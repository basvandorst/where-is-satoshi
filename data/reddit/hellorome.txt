Thanks, I appreciate the advice here. 


I feel that this is more understandable now with a few days hindsight after the fork. Some people still put coinbase as one of their top bitcoin trading sites. 
Good to hear about Gdax, I'll remember this site if i ever get into buying and selling bitcoin as a professional.

Great, it's true that they should make this more obvious for users to find out. Perhaps we could use our same account on both of these bitcoin exchanges? As the two most popular places to trade bitcoin there should be a bit of intercommunication between their two services. What is the parent company called btw?

how so? I feel that many people have changed their opinion of which are the best sites for buying bitcoin now that the hard fork has happened. August 1st 2017 may have changed things right?

Excellent list of sites, thanks :) I'm reading good things about Kraken. They've god especially good comments as the best place to buy bitcoin from Europe (trading is offered in euro + fast SEPA withdraws/deposits). Though when I login to my newly created account the interface looks slightly advanced to use. Perhaps it's just a learning curve then I'll be fine. 
What about cex exchange? Is this a good place to get bitcoins for beginner users? They look very professional and easy to use from a quick glance. But i'll have to investigate further 
And I wasn't aware that coinbase are now going to give users the new coins also. So i suppose they did the right thing after all? I was looking up their vault storage as this looks secure for long term storage after i buy. But are the any alternative bitcoin exchanges to coinbase that also offer a similar vault storage?

Hey thanks, yes I'm reading that Kraken is a great place for purchasing bitcoin if you're looking for large volumes (as their fees look really good). I'd say that finding a big bitcoin exchange with the best commissions is vital when going all in with hefty buys.
