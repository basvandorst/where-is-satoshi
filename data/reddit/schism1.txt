Your defending a crappy system. Your blaming the user for making mistakes when the system could be made so that human error is not possible. With Bitcoin it's  not possible for me to spend more than I have. I want a system that does not have to point a finger and say "it's your fault". I want a system where fault is not possible. 
You obviously like working harder not smarter. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:22:46
@_date: 2015-06-28 05:02:01
I don't want to have to spend time thinking about how much money I have. I should be able to look at my balance and know what it is instantly, but with the lag in the current system especially with things like checks that's not possible. The current system is crap.  It should be replaced with something instant ( does not have to be Bitcoin). But with Bitcoin I always know how much I have. I don't have to think or stress about it at all.

@_date: 2015-06-26 19:25:20
No, you send a check then 2 weeks later it gets withdrawn. By then you forgot about it. Overdrafts are there to cover the current slow system. Not a problem with bitcoin.

If the current system wasn't so slow I would not have an issue. I send a check then 2 weeks later it get pulled out of my account. By then I forgot about it.
@_date: 2015-06-28 04:53:39
It has to do with the fact that the current system is shit. It should not take weeks to send money. It should be instant. It's 2015 not 1915. I don't want to balance my account, that why we have computers so we don't have to waste our time doing monkey work.  You don't have to defend the system just because you like wasting your time counting beans.
@_date: 2015-06-28 04:44:24
It's not irrelevant. It's 2015, I should not have to spend my time counting beans because of an outdated slow system. When I spend money it should instantly show me how much I have. Stop defending a crappy system just because you enjoy it for some reason.

You don't need marriage to have romance. Marriage is for all the other stuff that comes with being with someone long term. Like finances, children, ownership of property. Romance is the easy and fun part whereas marriage is the logical serious part. 
In other words, If you just want romance there is no need to get married. Also, marriage adds nothing to romance (doesn't take anything away either).

It is deflationary. You can buy more with every year and that makes it deflationary. It does not matter that more is being created because there is not enough being created to make in inflationary.
Its the same with the US dollar... if the rate of printing is lower than the demand for dollars then USD would become deflationary even though they are still printing some.

Anyone who has a smartphone or computer can accept bitcoin right now. Just download a wallet to your phone and start accepting (5 minute setup time).
If they want to convert to USD instantly they can use Coinbase or Bitpay. Otherwise keep the bitcoins and spend them at places like overstock or convert them once a week buy selling them on coinbase.

Counterparty does everything colored coins promised to do and more. XCP is not needed to use it but it does help add additional functionality.

@_date: 2014-10-01 16:25:22
I wrote this a few weeks ago on a similar thread...
First of all credit cards and bitcoin are not exclusive of each other. You could have a credit card that uses bitcoin. So you would get all the benefits of a credit card while using bitcoin as the currency. Most likely there will be a hybrid solution in the future that gives some of the protection that credit cards give today.
Second, are we talking about credit cards or debit cards? With a credit card you are borrowing money which has some major issues I will not get [into]( (also has advantages - spend money you don't have yet). I will assume we are talking about debit cards. 
Issues with debt cards that bitcoin does not have:
Overdraft fees – new laws help but I still get them from time to time. More of a bank issue vs a card issue but you can’t have one without the other.
Speaking of banks - you are forced to open a bank account to use a debit card.
Bank can put a temporary "block" or "hold" on your money. To protect themselves from fraud or the government.
Government has direct access to your money.
Your personal info is given to the bank, the merchant, and the government. (And to hackers/con-men that steal it from these sources)
All prices are inflated to cover the cost of using cards by 3 or 4 %. If we got rid of all cards today you would have 4% more stuff. (hidden fee)
You have to hold dollars in your bank account to use a debit card. Dollars are always going down in value so you slowly losing money (another hidden fee). Now, bitcoin does not solve this problem because it is volatile but if wide spread adoption did happen it could maybe solve this issue (I emphasize maybe)
Some places make you prove your identity to use a debit card. 
Here's a good one - cant pay my buddy the 10 bucks I owe without first driving to an ATM. Bitcoin is more convenient in this case. He has a phone I have a phone - send it.
Speaking of easy - checking out online. Bitcoin is easier in some cases (some). I just pull up my iphone app and pay. It takes 30 seconds vs the 2 minutes it takes typing in all my info (info that can be stolen).

**How do Colored Coins compare to other crypto currency solutions?**
Ripple and Etherium both provide functionality similar to Colored Coins, but they do not run on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are altcoins and run independent blockchains. Mastercoin and Counterparty does run on Bitcoin's network, but you have to burn bitcoins to issue smart property or derivatives.
**Benefits of Colored Coins over altcoins**
1.Colored Coins issued by Coinprism also run on the Bitcoin blockchain, which makes it secure and robust.
2.With Colored Coins you don't need to buy hashing power in order to secure your coin. You piggy back on Bitcoin's network.
3.It takes a few minutes to create a new Colored Coin as opposed to at least several hours or days for a skilled programmer to create new altcoin.
4.If Open Assets becomes prevalent people can manage many Colored Coins they own in one wallet. The don't have to downloading and maintain a wallet app and the associated blockchain for every altcoin they have.
5.With Colored Coins you're in full control of all properties. You can change things around freely. For example you can issue more units over time. With an altcoin you can only do a fork if all users agree to upgrade to the new code.
6.You can recover (recycle) your bitcoins from your unneeded Colored Coins.
**Potential downsides of Colored Coins over altcoins**
1.With Colored Coins you're limited by Bitcoin's speed of approximately 10 minutes per confirmation.
2.There is no possibility of people mining Colored Coins. All Colored Coins are basically pre-mined, which makes sense since it is designed to represent an already existing asset and it's not meant to be a currency with a gradually increasing amount of units.
3.Users may be uncomfortable with the power you have over the properties of the Colored Coin.

I wrote this a few weeks ago on a similar thread...
First of all the current system and bitcoin are not exclusive of each other. You could have a credit card that uses bitcoin. So you would get all the benefits of a credit card while using bitcoin as the currency. Most likely there will be a hybrid solution in the future that gives some of the protection that credit cards give today.
Issues with the current system that bitcoin does not have:
• Overdraft fees – new laws help but I still get them from time to time. More of a bank issue vs a card issue but you can’t have one without the other.
• Speaking of banks - you are forced to open a bank account to use a debit card.
• Banks can put a temporary "block" or "hold" on your money. To protect themselves from fraud or the government.
• Government has direct access to your money (cypress).
• Your personal info is given to the bank, the merchant, and the government. (And to hackers/con-men that steal it from these sources)
• All prices are inflated to cover the cost of using cards by 3 or 4 %. If we got rid of all cards today you would have 4% more stuff. (hidden fee)
• You have to hold dollars in your bank account to use a debit card. Dollars are always going down in value so you slowly losing money (another hidden fee). Now, bitcoin does not solve this problem because it is volatile but if wide spread adoption did happen it could maybe solve this issue (I emphasize maybe)
• Some places make you prove your identity to use a debit card.

• Don’t have to deal with chargebacks – good for merchants
Terrible for consumers. 
-- Consumers do have to be more careful about where they send their money.
• Don’t get charged credit card fees – good for merchants and could be good for consumers in the long run.
Bitcoin isn't credit. How is this relevant? 
-- People use credit and debit cards because don’t want to carry tons of cash. But whether you use credit or debit there is a fee. The fees for bitcoin are lower (sometimes free).
• All prices are inflated to cover the cost of using cards by 3 or 4 %. If we got rid of all cards today you would have 4% more stuff. (Hidden fee)
Just like you do when you pay in cash, right? 
-- No one wants to carry tons of paper in their pocket in 2014. Are you serious? We need a digital solution.
• Don’t have to worry about overdraft fees – new laws help but I still get them from time to time.
You can't go overdrawn. Overdrafts are there to help you. With Bitcoin you just can't buy what you can't afford (if you could buy it with Bitcoin at all). 
-- LOL, Overdrafts are there because the current system is slow and laggy. The system does not know you don’t have enough funds because it’s slow. Banks make money on overdraft fees. They don’t help anyone. If you want to borrow money you use credit not overdrafts.
• Don’t need a bank or other middleman - Banks can put a temporary "block" or "hold" on your money. To protect themselves from fraud or the government.
How do you aquire Bitcoin without a middle man, are we talking about mining here or something? 
-- I just completed a job for Bitcoin. It’s the same way you make any money.
• Stops government from having direct access to your money (example: cypress).
They can see everything you own via the blockchain and force you to give it up. 
-- The money grab in cypress was easy for the government but if they had to go door to door with guns it would have never worked.
• Don’t need to give your personal info to the bank, the merchant, the government or to hackers/con-men that steal it from these sources.
You're joking? Have you not seen the authentication methods used by the likes of Circle, Coinbase and Bitcoin ATMs? 
-- I just completed a job for Bitcoin. No middleman was involved. I do have to pay my taxes so the government will know some info but they just want to know how much I made so they can get their cut.
• Dollars and other fiat are always going down in value so you are slowly losing money (another hidden fee). Now, bitcoin does not solve this problem because it is volatile but if wide spread adoption did happen it could maybe solve this issue (I emphasize maybe)
Bitcoin has been doing a fine job of losing value. My dollars are very stable.
-- The dollar is stable but is also losing value and will keep on losing value (we know that). And I emphasized "maybe'. In this case bitcoin is an experiment. We don't know the longterm stability of the price. Its still to early for most people to get involved but that does not negate the reasons I gave for using bitcoin.  
• I can pay my buddy the 10 bucks I owe without first driving to an ATM. Bitcoin is more convenient in this case. He has a phone I have a phone - send it. There are new solutions to do this with fiat but I think they take a cut (not sure).
Wire transfer, Paypal, Venmo or just having enough cash with me by planning ahead. 
-- Wire transfer 10 bucks? You must be joking. 
• Makes it easy to check out online. Bitcoin is easier in some cases (some). I just pull up my iphone app and pay. It takes 30 seconds vs the 2-3 minutes it takes typing in all my info (info that can be stolen). 
Oh, come on. You're getting desperate.
-- no just naming reasons to use bitcoin over fiat. Ease of use is important.
• Micro-payments
I agree it's definitely the least painful way to throw pennies at people. 
-- pennys can add up fast 
• Takes some power from Banks and government.
... 
-- ...
• Has the potential to be international (don’t need to convert to local currency).
You need currency to aquire Bitcoin.
-- No you don't. I explained above.
• You could get rich if the price rises.
-- I was naming reasons people use bitcoin and many people are in it for this reason. Also, I’ve made a money on it so I gave a valid point.
• You could trade it for profit.
-- again, Lots of people here are traders.
• It’s very fast and can be sent anywhere in the world.
If you don't mind the fees, the risk of price fluctuations and having to deal with a middle man to get your money out of it. 
-- You can get around all the things you mentioned.

Nicholas Cary: Thank you so much for having me. Oliver, great to meet you. We have a special announcement. We have conducted our second acquisition in 10 weeks. We have partnered with clark moody, one of the first Bitcoin adopters. He started building charts a few years ago and recently dabbled in a high-performance trading platform. We have made this acquisition 100% in Bitcoin, we are very excited to announce that we will be merging the -- real time trading platform into the world's most popular iphone and ipad app, zeroblock. For enthusiasts, this is exciting news. 
Host: Where you able to do this cheaper than you could have before, with the recent issues with Bitcoin? 
Nicholas Cary: We do the acquisitions a few weeks ago. We don't worry about price fluctuations on a day-to-day basis. Everyone at block chain is in for the long haul. 
Host: What is the name of the company?
Nicholas Cary:  rtbtc, real-time Bitcoin trading. It allows traders to buy and sell Bitcoin. We will implement a real-time newsfeed into the platform. It launched in 2013 in June and it has traded $150 million in transactions.
Host: You mentioned the transaction is taking place in Bitcoin. I might as well ask you, how many Bitcoin? 
Nicholas Cary: Of the details are exclusive but we all -- we do all of our transactions in Bitcoin. 
Host: We have been trying to get our head around how big that this business is. We know how much that MT. Gox has lost --we can have a number but give us an idea of how big this deal is? 
Nicholas Cary: These deals are getting bigger because there is so much innovation happening in this space. We are excited to have tools for traders who deserve professional level service and that is one thing you will see coming from us. 
Host: When you are doing these transactions in Bitcoin, and you are setting a certain value, I assume that yesterday -- now that the price has bounced back, you see a lot of volatility right now. Explain a little bit about how you are valuing this in Bitcoin. Is this against the currency or is this purely Bitcoin? 
Nicholas Cary: We do value it against the currency today and the terms of the deals being structured provide a little insurance against any form of volatility, just if you were to buy a company in euros. We may do several different payments over a. of time -- period of time just in case people are uncomfortable.
Host:  I am very bullish on Bitcoin, it is I think it is one of these great decentralized opportunities. If you look back at paypal in 1999, it had a lot of the same problems. I would like to understand from you, what are the problems that you think needs solving right now in this business, to make it a little bit more palatable to risk averse people. 
Host: He just liked you on facebook. 
Nicholas Cary: That is a really wonderful question. I think the challenge this year is for everyone in Bitcoin to build beautiful software. Everyone uses e-mail but don't understand how it worked under the cover. They use that because they understand it helps them send messages to everyone in the world, for free and that is the promise of Bitcoin. Just like in the 1900s when henry ford invented the car, a lot of people did not know how to drive yet and there were no off ramps or on reps or highways. That is happening in Bitcoin a little bit. Things are getting better and we are building amazing services and products to re-create a financial industry that is in desperate need of innovation. 
Host: Nick, people say there is strong and his potential in all Bitcoin world, but now you are -- there is strong potential in an all Bitcoin world but you are moving from this and other currencies, is this right? 
Nicholas Cary: Blockchain and Zeroblock will be the front for many exchanges, our company will never touch -- you may have trading platforms on top of nasdaq or the new york stock exchange, brokers use those services. 
Host: This is kind of like a trading aggregator, does that make sense? Like a consolidated order book. Where is the financial opportunity? The real value is in the underlying trading prep or -- platform. How do you make money? 
Nicholas Cary : You have instant news and also do trading. That is what we are involved with as well. 
Host : We do trading, but we also have a platform that is not an aggregator. Is it the idea that you can bring a number of the coin-related services under one roof? That is definitely what we do here at Bloomberg because there are so many ways of values being added, in one place, people may do more business with you than they may want to do with a single-service provider on his own? 
Nicholas Cary: You could definitely say that. When we launch more and more exchanges on Zeroblock, institutional traders will be able to visit and trade across any exchange and we will support mobile trading on zero block, the most popular android app for Bitcoin. 
Host: I wanted to ask, explain to me why you have been having trouble with apple lately. Explain to us a little bit about what happened to the app in the app store? 
Nicholas Cary: That was a setback of three weeks ago but it was not that unanticipated. Apple has taken a fairly hostile stance against Bitcoin services so far, they don't want people to send or receive Bitcoins. Information services like zero block are ok. We are building a world-class team to support this platform. Thank you, nick cary. Buying trading from rtbtc.

There are some weak answers here so I’ll give it a shot.
First of all credit cards and bitcoin are not exclusive of each other. You could have a credit card that uses bitcoin. So you would get the all benefits of a credit card while using bitcoin as the currency. Most likely there will be a hybrid solution in the future that gives some of the protection that credit cards give today.
Second, are we talking about credit cards or debit cards? With a credit card you are borrowing money which has some major issues I will not [get into]( (also has advantages - spend money you don't have yet). I will assume we are talking about debit cards. 
Issues with debt cards that bitcoin does not have:
- Overdraft fees – new laws help but I still get them from time to time. More of a bank issue vs a card issue but you can’t have one without the other.
- Speaking of banks - you are forced to open a bank account to use a debit card.
- Bank can put a temporary "block" or "hold" on your money. To protect themselves from fraud or the government.
- Government has direct access to your money.
- Your personal info is given to the bank, the merchant, and the government. (And to hackers/con-men that steal it from these sources)
- All prices are inflated to cover the cost of using cards by 3 or 4 %. If we got rid of all cards today you would have 4% more stuff. (hidden fee)
- You have to hold dollars in your bank account to use a debit card. Dollars are always going down in value so you slowly losing money (another hidden fee). Now, bitcoin does not solve this problem because it is volatile but if wide spread adoption did happen it could maybe solve this issue (I emphasize maybe)
- Some places make you prove your identity to use a debit card. 
- Here's a good one - cant pay my buddy the 10 bucks I owe without first driving to an ATM. Bitcoin is more convenient in this case. He has a phone I have a phone - send it.
- Speaking of easy - checking out online. Bitcoin is easier in some cases (some). I just pull up my iphone app and pay. It takes 30 seconds vs the 2 minutes it takes typing in all my info (info that can be stolen). 
There are probably more answers but I need to go to work now.
Edit - added to the list.

Nicholas Cary: Thank you so much for having me. Oliver, great to meet you. We have a special announcement. We have conducted our second acquisition in 10 weeks. We have partnered with clark moody, one of the first Bitcoin adopters. He started building charts a few years ago and recently dabbled in a high-performance trading platform. We have made this acquisition 100% in Bitcoin, we are very excited to announce that we will be merging the -- real time trading platform into the world's most popular iphone and ipad app, zeroblock. For enthusiasts, this is exciting news. 
Host: Where you able to do this cheaper than you could have before, with the recent issues with Bitcoin? 
Nicholas Cary: We do the acquisitions a few weeks ago. We don't worry about price fluctuations on a day-to-day basis. Everyone at block chain is in for the long haul.
 
Host: What is the name of the company?
Nicholas Cary:  rtbtc, real-time Bitcoin trading. It allows traders to buy and sell Bitcoin. We will implement a real-time newsfeed into the platform. It launched in 2013 in June and it has traded $150 million in transactions.
Host: You mentioned the transaction is taking place in Bitcoin. I might as well ask you, how many Bitcoin? 
Nicholas Cary: Of the details are exclusive but we all -- we do all of our transactions in Bitcoin.
 
Host: We have been trying to get our head around how big that this business is. We know how much that MT. Gox has lost --we can have a number but give us an idea of how big this deal is? 
Nicholas Cary: These deals are getting bigger because there is so much innovation happening in this space. We are excited to have tools for traders who deserve professional level service and that is one thing you will see coming from us. 
Host: When you are doing these transactions in Bitcoin, and you are setting a certain value, I assume that yesterday -- now that the price has bounced back, you see a lot of volatility right now. Explain a little bit about how you are valuing this in Bitcoin. Is this against the currency or is this purely Bitcoin? 
Nicholas Cary: We do value it against the currency today and the terms of the deals being structured provide a little insurance against any form of volatility, just if you were to buy a company in euros. We may do several different payments over a. of time -- period of time just in case people are uncomfortable.
Host:  I am very bullish on Bitcoin, it is I think it is one of these great decentralized opportunities. If you look back at paypal in 1999, it had a lot of the same problems. I would like to understand from you, what are the problems that you think needs solving right now in this business, to make it a little bit more palatable to risk averse people. 
Host: He just liked you on facebook.
 
Nicholas Cary: That is a really wonderful question. I think the challenge this year is for everyone in Bitcoin to build beautiful software. Everyone uses e-mail but don't understand how it worked under the cover. They use that because they understand it helps them send messages to everyone in the world, for free and that is the promise of Bitcoin. Just like in the 1900s when henry ford invented the car, a lot of people did not know how to drive yet and there were no off ramps or on reps or highways. That is happening in Bitcoin a little bit. Things are getting better and we are building amazing services and products to re-create a financial industry that is in desperate need of innovation. 
Host: Nick, people say there is strong and his potential in all Bitcoin world, but now you are -- there is strong potential in an all Bitcoin world but you are moving from this and other currencies, is this right? 
Nicholas Cary: Blockchain and Zeroblock will be the front for many exchanges, our company will never touch -- you may have trading platforms on top of nasdaq or the new york stock exchange, brokers use those services.
 
Host: This is kind of like a trading aggregator, does that make sense? Like a consolidated order book. Where is the financial opportunity? The real value is in the underlying trading prep or -- platform. How do you make money?
 
Nicholas Cary : You have instant news and also do trading. That is what we are involved with as well. 
Host : We do trading, but we also have a platform that is not an aggregator. Is it the idea that you can bring a number of the coin-related services under one roof? That is definitely what we do here at Bloomberg because there are so many ways of values being added, in one place, people may do more business with you than they may want to do with a single-service provider on his own? 
Nicholas Cary: You could definitely say that. When we launch more and more exchanges on Zeroblock, institutional traders will be able to visit and trade across any exchange and we will support mobile trading on zero block, the most popular android app for Bitcoin.
 
Host: I wanted to ask, explain to me why you have been having trouble with apple lately. Explain to us a little bit about what happened to the app in the app store? 
Nicholas Cary: That was a setback of three weeks ago but it was not that unanticipated. Apple has taken a fairly hostile stance against Bitcoin services so far, they don't want people to send or receive Bitcoins. Information services like zero block are ok. We are building a world-class team to support this platform. Thank you, nick cary. Buying trading from rtbtc.

Bitcoin is not about redistribution of wealth (that's a unrelated topic). It is simply better money than what currently exists.
Although I will say that Bitcoin may allow for changes to the current structure of society that may not have been possible before its invention.

"While not considered a true currency, bitcoin is commonly referred to as a digital currency, virtual currency, electronic money, or cryptocurrency."
It says it’s not a true currency but does not define a true currency. But if you go to currency on Wikipedia and read how it is defined then bitcoin does meet that definition.
Also, considered by whom?

@_date: 2014-03-12 21:44:26
Same as you. Seems like a good solution.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:44:53
•	Don’t have to deal with chargebacks – good for merchants
•	Don’t get charged credit card fees – good for merchants and could be good for consumers in the long run.
•	All prices are inflated to cover the cost of using cards by 3 or 4 %. If we got rid of all cards today you would have 4% more stuff. (Hidden fee)
•	Don’t have to worry about overdraft fees – new laws help but I still get them from time to time.
•	Don’t need a bank or other middleman - Banks can put a temporary "block" or "hold" on your money. To protect themselves from fraud or the government.
•	Stops government from having direct access to your money (example: cypress).
•	Don’t need to give your personal info to the bank, the merchant, the government or to hackers/con-men that steal it from these sources.
•	Dollars and other fiat are always going down in value so you are slowly losing money (another hidden fee). Now, bitcoin does not solve this problem because it is volatile but if wide spread adoption did happen it could maybe solve this issue (I emphasize maybe)
•	I can pay my buddy the 10 bucks I owe without first driving to an ATM. Bitcoin is more convenient in this case. He has a phone I have a phone - send it. There are new solutions to do this with fiat but I think they take a cut (not sure).
•	Makes it easy to check out online. Bitcoin is easier in some cases (some). I just pull up my iphone app and pay. It takes 30 seconds vs the 2-3 minutes it takes typing in all my info (info that can be stolen). 
•	Micro-payments
•	Takes some power from Banks and government.
•	Has the potential to be international (don’t need to convert to local currency).
•	You could get rich if the price rises.
•	You could trade it for profit.
•	It’s very fast and can be sent anywhere in the world.
•	It’s easy to divided even into tiny amounts.

but the 3rd party interfered with the buyer and seller before the trade because the buyer could only withdraw bitcoin so he bought at an inflated price just to get his money out. The seller assumed he would be able to withdraw fiat at some point (he never did).

You can have (and we do) centralized systems that work on top of Bitcoin that look just like the current system and allow reversibility.

You can have both with Bitcoin but not fiat.

I saw it on the 2nd page earlier today. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:15:06
You could not withdraw from Mt Gox at that time, making that number not legit. Any one that sold at $1224 on Gox could not withdraw it so it was not real money. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 04:01:04
12 bucks. I would expect the price to only go down from here.
@_date: 2016-03-27 14:47:57
That's too high. It needs to be $.01 or less so we can say "practically free"
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:01:49
Miners are scared that Lightning will take away some of their revenue and so have blocked Segwit as a way to block Lightning. This article explains why Lighting will actually increase their revenue ,not decrease it. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 01:02:08
This is really really cool! Now you can give someone Bitcoin and they don't have to do any "nerdy computer stuff" . $12 is a great price for a first of its kind device. I imagine the price will just go down from here. 
EDIT: They don't take bitcoin as payment? WTF?

You are delusional.

The last paragraph is the most interesting part:


What are these new partnerships that will make bitcoin legitimate?
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:44:21
Segwit is a great update , there is no reason for these alts not to make this update. 
Bitcoins issues are political and not about the quality of the update. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:33:49
I agree, we all got the spam. Just ignore it. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:47:37
I'm confused, Did you send the scammer the bitcoin?

I think these "experiments" will be studied for a long time.

It was not legitimate at the time. You could not withdraw USD from MT Gox when it hit $1243. So traders had to buy BTC to get it off the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:00:31
Considering there are a million users not complaining those numbers look tiny.

@_date: 2017-01-30 21:55:28
The blocks are starting to get a little full and that raises the fees. The fork (softfork) would give more room in the blocks and lower the fees(as well as other good stuff - its an upgrade). The upgrade is being held up due to some infighting.

The same thoughts are spinning around in my head right now. The only advantage Bitcoin has is it has bigger networks (mining, users, merchants). That is a big advantage but if everyone starts to get frustrated with the scaling issues things could turn very quickly.

Litecoin is basically just a clone of Bitcoin and considering Bitcoin had a much bigger network effect there was no reason to even think about Litecoin. But if Litecoin implements segwit it suddenly become better software, it suddenly becomes the only cyptocoin that can scale, it suddenly becomes the coin that can use lightning. 
Edit: I just read my own post and it sound like I'm pumping Litecoin but that was not my intention.

I exaggerated a bit but to change the subject some, which one of those miners or businesses do you think has the average users best interest in mind? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 06:31:32
referring to them as 'cult members' is derogatory and you don't need to belittle them just to make yourself feel all superior in terms of market knowledge. You don't know if what you're saying is even on point, YOU'D like it to be true because clearly you have a vested interest.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:02:33
I would not call r/btc major. They are a vocal minority(5%). Thats not to say a minority cant be right. I agree with the majority but think the debate has been good for bitcoin.

Altcoin trading discussion is not really tolerated here so Ill change the question some: What altcoins have features we want in bitcoin?
1. Ethereurm - smart contracts (BTC version - rootstock)
2. Monero - anonymous transactions (BTC gets this with lightning) 
3. Litecoin - adopting segwit and lightning soon (Bitcoin has a bunch of drama around this slowing it down)

Segwit gives the capacity increase you want. It would give the time you want. You should be writing letters to the miners to signal for segwit instead of posting here.

I would argue that bitcoin is a better currency than every currency except for the major reserve currencies.
•United States dollar.
•Pound sterling.
•Japanese yen.
•Swiss franc.
•Canadian dollar.
•Chinese yuan.
There are a couple others so that puts bitcoin around the 10th best currency.
What do I mean by best? If you were forced by gun point to put all your wealth in a currency which would you pick? I would go down the list of reserve currencies and then bitcoin (putting it around 9th or 10th on my list.

Bitcoin does not need to be bought in masse for it to be useful. People use it now as a hedge against fiat. Even if only a hundred Chileans use it at least they had one option outside the government monopoly on money. Not everyone has the belief that government can solve all problems and I am happy those people at least have an option when it comes to their money.

That is how it works, Bitcoin mining can make electrical grids more stable and bring down consumer costs. 
I met some guys in Texas working on a project that finds electrical plants that have excess energy at certain points of the day and they will only turn on the miners when there is excess energy. This stabilizes the grid.

When value is sent over the bitcoin network its actually done in Satoshis, it is the basic unit of account on the network. A bitcoin is just a certain amount of satoshis (100,000,000). Its like a beanbag, each beanbag may have a hundred beans in it. Satoshis are the beans and a bitcoin is the bag.

I actually believe all the debates (and arguments) on this topic have been a good thing. It's a fairly complex topic that defines the future of Bitcoin (how it will scale).

The majority of currencies are not reserve currencies. Reserve currencies are where all the worlds wealth is held. No one (with a Brain) holds wealth in any of those red areas. 
Reserve currencies: 
US dollar 
Euro 
Chinese renminbi    
              
Pound sterling 
Japanese yen 
Canadian dollar 
Australian dollar 
Swiss franc
and a few others
I would say that Bitcoin is a better place to hold wealth than any non reserve currency but is no where near as safe as the reserves. With that said, I think Bitcoin will eventually be on that list.

The funny thing is that the very thing that made Litecoin not special is the very thing that now makes it special. -That it is just a copy of Bitcoin-
A copy that had small changes to make it "Lite". Lite being faster blocktimes (if Bitcoin had faster blocks then they would not be full right now) so the faster blocks turned out to be a prophetic decision. And now Litecoin will get segwit, making Litecoin everything I want Bitcoin to be. 
Bitcoin should copy Litecoins code for an hilarious turn of events.

It was 60% of trades due to no fees but it was not 60% of new money coming in which is what drives the price up. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:56:44
The US switched from a first-to-invent system to a first-to-file system in 2013. This forces company's like coinbase to file patents in order to be the first to file.
Being cool has nothing to do with it. Blame the changes in the patent system that screws inventors in favor of corporations.
Also, it does not matter if there is prior art. Its better to file and let others contest it than to have to contest it when others file.
EDIT: I'm not trying to defend coinbase, I'm just explaining why this is a smart business decision.

First of all this is hilarious to watch. Kim is such caricature of an internet-nerd-millionaire ( you can’t make this stuff up)
With that said; the discussion is worth watching. They explain that Bitcache is off chain micro transactions that can then with withdrawn with Bitcoin. 
This is also a pump to get investors. They want 5,000,000. It’s not clear to me yet how developed the whole thing is or why they need 5 mill. 
At the end they all yell “It’s gona be HUGE!”. Which was corny but honestly they could be right.

The merchants not paying anything. Your paying the 3%, it's coming out of your pocket. It's just hidden which makes the whole thing seem scammy. Why hide it?

It doesn't show all the dead birds floating in the water.
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:55:09
Its basically the same as Coinbase and Circil if you are in the US. If you use a site like BTC-E then yes it has less privacy but with Gemini you know who you are dealing with and have legal recourse unlike BTC-E. 
The scum already avoids Coinbase and they will avoid Gemini.
@_date: 2015-10-19 13:38:00
Also localbitcoins if you really want to use cash.

Hong King agreement was honored. The devs promised to hard fork if it was needed. It was not needed. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:36:11
Oh God its funnier than I remember. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:45:55
I think new money uses GDAX and Gemini and old money is on stamp. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:35:14
What is disingenuous? Neither core or users agreed to a hardfork. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:51:29
Reading your question made me realize how complex this space has become over the past couple years.

You seem confused. Libertarian does not equal anarchist.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:02:20
Considering taxes are more like 30% I think the premium could be a least that much but you also have to factor in that users don't have to hold and secure bitcoin and its in a familiar trading instrument. That combined could justify a 60% or so premium. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:40:07
or you do wait to see if it is a stable enough asset to invest in. Its less risky now than it was a year ago.

They will only be worth something if places like coinbase support them.

your confusing the 2 inflations. one is the inflation of the money supply and one is the inflation rate. Due to adoption bitcoin has a negative inflation rate. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:48:03
Why? Nothing has changed, we all knew this is the stance they would take and they said they are not going to bring charges.

Why is it bullshit? Are they doing something that could be done without a blockchain?

You have to think about retirements accounts like prison for money. Inside real prison cigarettes cost a lot more. Inside retirement accounts bitcoins cost much more.

The one rule of you don't talk about ethereum.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:22:35
You are correct and I see your point now but the SECs weak stance here means there will still be icos until they go after someone. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:20:14
Nope, There is a $10,000 limit on Bitcoin also. (per 24 hours)
@_date: 2015-03-30 01:35:24

I found this in the comment section of that link:
From: Alan Graham
"Co-founder of one of the projects mentioned here, OCL…a bit more about what it actually is and how it came to be.
We began 2 years ago with a simple premise to solve the issues surrounding copyright and user-generated content. I was tired of seeing takedowns and all the fighting. I wanted platforms to be free of takedowns, citizens to not worry about “can they,” and artists and rights owners to get paid (every time). We worked from the bottom up with artists, indies, their trade organizations, unions, managers, etc. showing them what we were building and getting their support. From that we built something that gives everyone form all sides…what they want.
Our first front facing bit of kit can deliver any media to any user through any app, natively with all the rights cleared so users can create/remix all the UGC works they like with no concerns over takedowns, copyright infringement, etc. We do this with a multi-repertoire approach that means you can clear disparate assets across different owners (a song and a video and some images all mashed together). Rights owners and artists can let their works go safely, while ensuring there is a micropayment for every single use of media. Artists get paid for every single use. And zero DRM. We’re even compatible with Creative Commons with auto attribution and a notification engine that tells you when your works are used and where.
With a singular API, apps can add catalogues of videos, music, images, text (and more) directly into their app with no issues over rights or how to source content. All of the rights cleared, no complicated deals. Our APIs also make it possible for apps to be able to integrate cloud based music services so that music from streaming sources can be embedded directly into any creation, and monetize that as well. Users of apps are going to see functionality and freedom that’s never been seen before…and no more complexity over copyright. As we say…we make copyright compatible.
Another API allows users to legally pull assets out of digital creations (i.e. pull a photo out of a video) and reuse/remix them (from the original source materials). No copy/paste…no need to download or take something without permission. We make it easy to freely grab creative works with a single tap…even from the web. So go ahead and mash it up…we can unmash it and you can mash it again.
But that just scratches the surface. Our back end technologies harness (as mentioned) centralized and decentralized tech to provide a suite of services and capabilities that no artist has ever seen before. We utilize a combination of distributed revision control and the blockchain to register ownership of works, determine usage/terms/rates, and you can then use the blockchain to audit us, or use us to audit the blockchain (or audit anyone else). We’re designed to be a bridge between legacy systems and the future, as we can also work with any PRO (and are current working with some).
Our technology is capable of introducing scarcity (limited editions), where you can actually have 1 of say 100k works…whether you prefer streaming or actual files (and that’s just the beginning). We also ensure that regardless of what type of rights owner you happen to be, you are in control of your terms and rates and you get paid for each and every use. We’ve even demystified blockchain and crypto currencies for users and rights owners. All of this technology and more is running today.
We’re building a technical suite of solutions for creative people, both professionals and amateurs…removing the frictions between everyone surrounding issues of copyright and unlocking new possibilities no one has ever seen before.
And did I mention…every use of media can be paid for…and every payment is accounted for and can go directly to who owns it. The possibilities of what this could do is only limited by imagination.
We are currently working with partners on a public beta for 2015. If you want to know more, drop us a line."

Bitcoin is meant to replace the central bank, not the local bank.

If you have to ask...
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:52:33
So people are using Bitcoin to buy something and its driving the price up?
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:57:15
An exciting thing is happening in the cryptocurrency space and people want to discuss it. 
and there is nothing stagnate about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 16:30:49
You can do all those things. There are Bitcoin debit cards now.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:39:01
Eth is just as risky as Bitcoin during this turbulence. If Bitcoin gets segwit activated you could see a big drop in Eth. 
Bitcoin + Segwit + RSK could be a ETH killer. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:22:14
I don't think bitcoin will replace paper money but at the same time I never have paper money on me. Its to much work to get it. I always have bitcoin on me because I always have my phone.  
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:50:59


It actually doesn't have a specific definition. I can find many definitions just with a quick Google search. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:15:57
from my point of view the jedi are evil
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:53:15
Its amazing how you can find old discussions about some of these topics. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:16:32
Depends how you define downtime. I had a legit transaction get stuck when the first spamming happened (before dynamic fees were implemented in wallets). I consider that downtime in that the system did not work when I expected it to. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:56:39
does not matter if its a scam, you wont make any money with it so why do it?
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:07:32
Yep, BTC is like the USD of cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:43:12
The only international currency that is not controlled by a nation, or company, or person. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:00:54
I pretty much agree with your assessment but do you think the testing ground has a least validated some of the things clueful Bitcoin already knew?
@_date: 2013-07-29 13:44:52
Not a good comparison. Its Bitcoins are made illegal in the US the price will plummet and everyone will stop using them.
@_date: 2016-07-25 22:00:49
Your looking to much at the legal definitions and not at the average joe definition. Both are correct definitions. Everyone says " I have no money in my bank account"
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:49:44
Nothing wrong with using Coinbase to buy. Just don't store you coins there long term. If you have more then 1 BTC get a Trezor. Otherwise just keep them on your phone. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 15:56:40
Not unless you have free electricity.

Bitcoin does not compete with Paycash, it competes with USD (or other paper currencies).

You said" Ethereum is scaling better". Its not. Blockchain size is part of the scaling issue. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:47:00
If you think Bitcoin is going down... zoom out. We are up $2000 dollars the past year. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:06:59
But look at how fast the Eth blockchain is growing, its almost the size of Bitcoins blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:39:21
You should not be trading at coinbase, use a real exchange like Gemini or GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:56:09
Yep, and these centralized system are fine for most people. Eventually we will have decentralized ones like lightning. 
Even cash has a payment layer (debit cards)
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:05:20

Paypal is not a currency, it's a payment system. The US Dollar is a currency. Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment system. But unlike the USD and PayPal it is open sourced so it not controlled by any company or country.

I prefer to call it a 'decentralized international currency'. Although if you insist on pointing out that it runs on a computer network then 'digital' is better than 'virtual'

@_date: 2013-12-20 15:44:29
Why even call it a Digital Currency? We should just call it an 'International' currency. Or better yet the only International currency.
