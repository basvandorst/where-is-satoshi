I think taking profits off the table along the way is critical.  If you have doubled your position, take half and put it elsewhere in another more steady asset class. Hell even cash is fine in the short term.  Once you have done that, it's all free money.  Even if you lose it all, you aren't out more than you started with.
I cant imagine being up hundreds of BC and not pulling at least half of that out and buying gold, or spyder index funds or a some rental properties or something.  It seems like madness.

You never know where the price is going to go.  it's supposed to be unclear!  It's  about risk managment - not gambling.  People who control risk live to fight again and again, those who don't blow up their accounts.
If I had 100k in bitcoin after a 50k investment, id sell 50k of it, then keep the other 50 in. When that 50 doubled, Id take half of that out etc. when that remaining amount doubled, sell 1/2 of it.  If nothing else it leaves you with cash to buy back in in case of a massive correction.
Sure you end up with less overall than if you magically know to keep it all in and sell at the "top" whenever that happens to be, but since we live in the real world, only a few lucky people do that. And you can't manage risk based on yourself being lucky. There will always be some people who got richer by being luckier. Forget about them.  The point is to make some money, and minimize you downside so that you cant ever be wiped out. Split the difference and always assume you you are neither blessed nor cursed - just average.
There are many ways to go about it, so just find what work for you.  But it's a shame for people to ever by up a ton of money and be exposed to losing it all due to greed and fear of  missing out of making even more.
