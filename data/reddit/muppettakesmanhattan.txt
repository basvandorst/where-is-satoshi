You appear to be correct, they even removed the minimum you can send so that you can empty your account.  I just sent like 700 satoshis that was stuck when I checked a few years ago because it was too small to send.  
  
I cannot find my bitcoin addresses associated with my account and it is not clear what would happen if I tried sending bitcoin to the address I just received satoshis from (not going to try!).

Not effective.  Mixers create a fingerprint because they do not mix in a truly random way so it can be seen when you are mixing and still traced because the blockchain is transparent.
You might end up mixing with known stolen coins and that can cause you trouble because bitcoin is not fungible.  If you end up with stolen coins and try to cash them out on an exchange or use them on a DNM, they may decide to just keep them.
  
If you want anonimity, use m o n e r o.

Mental gymnastics, I see a lot of this from his supporters when the topic of Ross trying to kill people comes up.  
  
Really popular rebuttals:
  
- He wasn't charged with murder (the evidence was presented during his trial and not invalidated)  
- The agents were corrupt (there were more than one instance of Ross trying to knock people off and believing he had succeeded)  
- They were trying to blackmail him (really?  This justifies murder? No it does not.)
- The evidence from his laptop was faked by the corrupt agents (The agents that captured him were on a totally separate team and have good reputations)  And Ross did not dispute the evidence.
  
There's more but you get the idea.

Thank you for putting in some effort, now review all of the evidence so you can understand what role those agents played in the overall picture.  They did not have a role in capturing Ross or validating the evidence in the case and nothing they gathered was used in the case.  In fact we know about all of this because they were charged for their crimes like they should have been.  Just because they did bad things, does not invalidate the bad things Ulbricht did.

A known strength in that we knew from the beginning that it takes a majority to make change and we knew the majority would be made up of people.

How about theft?  Should people be murdered for theft?  Ross intended for people to die for stealing.  Neither blackmail nor theft is an excuse to kill someone.  If you are resorting to murder for those reasons then you are wrong for even thinking it was an option.
@_date: 2016-12-12 18:15:40
Coinbase is protecting themselves against fraud.  Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed while your ACH and debit transactions can be reversed.  Also, if you're new, they want to ensure you are you so they will limit their risk by keeping your limits low until you verify and build trust through multiple buys over time.

That was one of 6 instances and I don't think your argument is having the affect on me you want it to.  I am not OK with people using murder to protect their criminal enterprises.  It is not OK to do that, I don't care how wrong the war on drugs is, it is not an excuse.  Ross intended for people to die and he didn't care about collateral damage, that is wrong.  Ulbricht's intent matters to me and I will never support him because of it.
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:43:43


  
Good.  If bitcoin is going to be strong and resist central control then it must continue to be tested from every vector possible.

So far he has failed and we should be thankful for his efforts.

@_date: 2016-12-15 20:05:56
Like I said elsewhere, I am judging based on the evidence.  I am considering where it came from, the process of discovery, the presentation and the actions of Ross and his defense.  All of it including the verdict which was arrived at based on the evidence presented.  I am not endorsing the evidence solely on the verdict.

It will create an on-ramp for people to invest in bitcoin using traditional methods.  People feel this will be good for bitcoin because it has the potential to put pressure on the price.  The pressure would come from new investors and the fact that the Trust would need to hold .1 BTC for each share it issues.  So the bigger it gets, the more BTC gets taken of the market which should put pressure on the supply and thus the price.  Shit could get real.

It's not that simple.  Mining pools aren't going to risk 12.5 BTC for less than 1BTC in fees if they don't have to.  They walk a fine line between profit and reputation.  Antpool being the largest can afford to spend some reputation to maintain their profits.  Reputation is being spent right here in this thread so maybe they will stop now. :)

Bitcoin is nothing more than a computer generated prize for solving a complicated math puzzle.  Unlike gold, silver or even tulip bulbs, it has no intrinsic value, but it's useful for moving money via offshore markets of questionable regulation. A bitcoin cost pennies of electricity to create in the past, and is structured to cost considerably more to create as the pool increases.  Wired magazine has several articles on the topic:  
  
It's obvious there is considerable incentive of earlier "minters" of bitcoin to pump and dump before the music stops.
  
What are you willing to pay for a computer generated prize?

 Ohm  Excellent description of Bitcoin! The block chain technology has many potential uses (such as custody of securities) but Bitcoin itself is not likely to become a useful currency.   In order to have value,  money must be convertible (into gold, silver, US dollars, or something else of value) or to have a monopoly power (as the legal tender laws give to the US dollar).

It sounds like you sent them bitcoin using the email feature on coinbase.  This sends the recipient an email telling them you sent bitcoin and to sign up to receive it.

There was an article about it that got plastered on reddit during the test.  They counted visits without donations as lost donations and since visits were inflated because of the hype, it contributed to the lost donations total.  That's where the "adding bitcoin as an option made us lose money" narrative came from.

How is this a huge win for bitcoin and why should I care about blockchain.info?
  
EDIT: Looks like asking questions isn't welcome around here.  I'm guessing someones PR firm had its way with this thread last night.

Common sense has nothing to do with this.  This is a highly technical issue that requires a wide range of skills to understand the implications for such changes.  Best to leave it to the experts and try to educate yourself along the way in hopes that some day you can contribute.

Bitfinex has a history of being hacked and losing coins.  I would use Gemini or Coinbase at this point.

The biggest WTF about the mozilla "test" was that the donation link didn't show for every visitor.  So if you saw an article mentioning that they are now accepting bitcoin as a donation option and you went looking for it, you might not even see it.  Just the article alone messed up the test because many people went looking just to see if it was true with no intention of donating.  And they counted those visits as lost donations!

Is there actual proof that Mark was the one running willy-bot?

It was a naive dream.  At best it was zero sum and the same people suffering because of the drug war were the only ones who suffered.  However, that isn't likely to be the case because SR was immensely successful and put pressure on drug producers to produce more drugs, so it is likely more people suffered as a result of the silk road.  But of course it made it easier for white people to safely buy drugs so it must have been a wonderful thing. /s

Fuck off with your drama.  I'm sick of it and I know others are too because they PM me telling me when I tell you to fuck off.  So another fuck off for all my friends who hate your shit posting too.

Is it normal to pay for a bank account in Europe?

Check out the two comments too.  They are working so hard to corral this thing.

Everything is a conspiracy with you, fuck off and go play in rbtc with your mental bullshit.
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:36:30
Obviously everyone is like you and cares deeply about what random people on the internet think.  Get over yourself and go make a new account and get your rocks off in rbtc.

You're doing it again.  Prove the evidence is fake.

2.5% isn't going to cover the 100% loss from credit card fraud.

Can you expound more on that?  What part requires flash?

They are up against sophisticated fraudsters, put yourself in their shoes.  They have both the government and random people all over the world trying to rip them off or use them to rip off others 24/7.
