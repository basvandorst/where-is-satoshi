320 :(
I knew it was a risk to just let them sit on Gox but I ended up focusing on a bunch of other things and never made it a priority to pull them out. I trusted that a ton of other people were holding coins and cash on Gox and thought it was a decent place to keep things stored - even more so than holding the coins on my computer for fear of a random trojan or something getting on my box. I intended to transfer them all to Coinbase, but then Gox announced BTC withdrawals were closing and it was too late. I still have a glimmer of hope that I will recover something. I really am going through the 5 stages of grief so I am probably in denial and too hopeful at this point.

Hmm... what would a 100K BTC sell do to the price?
1. Finally unlock 200K BTC in cold storage after fixing deterministic key issue
2. Sell 100K BTC to drive the price as low as possible
3. Slowly start buying in at low prices
4. Profit?

202,000 Found BTC ~= $116 million USD*
650,000 Lost BTC ~= $374 million USD*
*based on Bitstamp's current price

I wonder if he is unphased being down $67 million today

What am I looking at?

Fun fact, if bitcoin had the same growth in 2014 as in 2013, Satoshi's coins would be worth $46.9 billion

**Price of bitcoin, value of the lost 850K BTC**
$300, $255 million
$200, $170 million
$100, $85 million

Thanks! Electrum looks great. Any words of warning on using the standalone .exe?
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:10:03
Yeah that is pretty crazy. I'm guessing gave him the money in Bitcoin and didn't switch it to USD?
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:57:21
Yeah I was very foolish and far too trusting

Ah yeah! Get your cash ready I'll be so stoked if I can buy in in the 200s

Last crash there was lots of flapping around for a week, then what looked like a recovery which then turned into a slow death for a few months until things turned around.
For this crash, just guessing I'm thinking we could see as low as $200's in panic sells, then back up to $600+, then slow dying down to the mid $300's until some news pushes back up to new heights

It's super simple now - would love to hear any feedback and feature requests!

No money flowing into the exchanges from bank transfers

Not sure the implications, maybe Mt. Gox is low and we can expect it to go higher today. Anyone know how Coinbase sets their price?

Put some of my thoughts from this weekend down in a blog post tonight. Comments appreciated!
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:44:58
I guess it's more wishful thinking that it will get into the $200's, but my guess is sometime by the end of the year. We'll see!
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:32:23
Well you are up BTC so you shouldn't feel too bad. Time to turn into a long holder. :)
